However, you might be able to find something exclusive and/or unique for your money. Perfect day for visiting: Any weekend with good weather."

This is an area of town with diverse attractions for all kinds of travelers and toursists. Here, you will find: great LGBTQ nightlife for all genders; loads of interesting boutiques full of different styles, across a whole gamut of prices from clothing-by-the-kilo vintage to department store name brands to famous luxury and designer brand; varied and good quality dining; museums for the whole family to enjoy, such as the Mus\u00e9e Picasso and Victor Hugo's house; a vibrant open-air market, March\u00e9 des Enfants Rouges; historic buildings; and numerous cafes. If you stay here, you are also only about 20-30 minutes on foot and even less time via metro from many other destinations in central Paris, including the Louvre and the Centre Pompidou, as well as Ch\u00e2telet and Les Halles, where there is a lot more shopping and dining to be found."

There is nothing more lovely than picnicking on the lawn of the Place de Vosges, during the day or even in the evening.

We did take an Uber taxi from the airport as we did not know where to go at first but then we used the metro & subway for traveling almost every day & found it very easy. Lots of walking but a true treat in the summer. Discovered museums and quaint shops in the area as we went on tourist jaunts & the people are quite friendly - we don't know a word of french, so it was refreshing to see the locals try to help in broken english,..we are from Cape Town but have traveled and lived in Ireland, on the Isle of Wight UK & in Geneve Switzerland.

Look out for the scenic inside squares and small alleyways and the lovely communal gardens - and this is where you also find so many charming restaurants and boutiques round ever corner. Our impression was that you get much closer to a \"true\" impression of Paris life there than at the major sights with thousands of visitors elbowing their way past each other."

It is full of museums so you can spend days just within this arrondissement.It has excellent transport links and you can get anywhere fast.Then it is close to the Seine, where one is overcome to take their partner in their arms and kiss them romantically."

Im American, from Los Angeles, I've lived in Paris for a few years, and I would have to say it is a safe, cool, and definitely must see place in Paris. Really so much to say as far as what to see and do, but the whole arrondissement is totally walkable so I'll leave it for you to discover!*Gay Tip: Le Marais is what West Hollywood is to Los Angeles. Nightlife is awesome, and the locals know they live in the gay friendly arrondissement of Paris, so this is the place to be and all that jazz *"

The shopping is superb too with wonderful boutiques, jewellery shops, kitchen stores etc. etc. The area is steeped in history and some amazing buildings and museums. We were around the corner from Musee Carnavalet and Musee Picasso to name a couple. The controversial Centre Pompidou is also located nearby. The Marais has a throbbing beat to its pulse which seems to come alive from around lunchtime on. It is a great location to just amble through the little cobbled streets and take in the ambience of it all."

Le Marais has been a very popular neighborhood for tourists for quite a while, and after many transformations in the last 20-30 years, it is increasingly gentrifying. And yet, it is still a charming \"quartier\", full of quaint shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, the \"re-born\" Rue des Rosiers with various excellent falafel shops, charming little streets, almost no car traffic, and a polyglot m\u00e9lange of Jewish tradition and the queer scene. A very relaxing area of an otherwise buzzing city. And very much off the big bus tour group paths of the French capital. Recommended for individualists and leisure lovers."

All the attractions are within walking distance and buses run along rue de Rivoli to the Eiffel Tower (\u20ac2) There are plenty of little streets to wander among and in the evening lots of really good restaurants where you can eat relatively cheaply. Don't order water with your meal or you'll get a bottle of the most expensive water the rest carries. Instead order \"un carafe d'eau\",which is just tap water but excellent. Also there are hundreds of public water fountains in Paris some even dispense ice cold sparkling water."

Mostly, staying at a small hotel in the area, L'hotel Jeanne D'Arc, we crossed the street to eat dinner at least four times, and we walked to other fabulous small restaurants.

I spent a could days just wandering the streets and alleys, enjoying lunch at small cafes and some of the best pastries from shops just around the corner from adorable alleys. Some great shopping (in themed sections it seemed - found a street with 4 calligraphy shops in a row). Did pass a few bigger name stores on the main streets, but that didn't take away from our enjoyment of the entire neighbourhood. A great place to get away from typical tourists Paris, and interact with more locals. Loved it."

Despite the constant rain when I was there, I absolutely loved the Marais, and it's the part of the city that I think back on most fondly and often. There are of course wonderful historic and cultural sites like the Place des Vosges and the Musee Carnavalet among many others, but I found it rewarding just to wander aimlessly through the streets. Next time I go to Paris, I'll stay in this area!"

It has been a Jewish neighborhood for many years and consequently, during the Nazi occupation from 1940-1945, witnessed much of the suffering and deportation of tens of thousands of Parisian Jews to death camps. We were told that 11,000 of the Jewish deportees from Paris were children. There are plaques on many of the buildings that commemorate some aspect of that terrible time.The history of the Marais parallels the history of Paris; it was once the site of Royal residences, it has long been the center for art salons and crowded cafes, it suffered for awhile during the post WWII period but has reemerged once again a bustling, happy neighborhood that draws visitors from all over the world."

Many high end boutiques crowd the streets around the area and many small places to eat nearby. Really neat place to window shop as many of the clothes can be over 100-300 euros a piece. Some shops have cheaper items but you could easily spend over 200 euros in a woman's shirt and over 200 euros on some men's dress shoes. If that's your style you'll love these small shops. If not, walk around it for the history, and plaques on certain buildings telling short stories of what went on in the mid 1940's. And get falafel at one of many shops on the main streets. Definitely worth a stop to look around and enjoy a small piece of history. A few blocks away is also victor Hugo's house. Enjoy!"

A few places (notably Montmatre, the Eiffel Tower and L'Arc de Triomphe) are further afield and require the assistance of the excellent public transport or one of the two 'hop on / hop off' bus services.As for eating - there is an abundance of eating places - boulangeries, cafes, brasseries and restaurants. Most are friendly, relaxed places with a good range of food. Choosing 'la plat de jour' daily specials ensures a good meal for reasonable prices.There are also good services (banks, post office, metro stations and many buses along the Rue de Rivoli).Overall, the Marais gives you access, convenience and a taste for a little of the Paris life style."

It was the best decision I could have ever made. I was traveling with my 80 year old father and 11 year old niece and to be honest it was hard to get them out of the Marais except for going to dinner restaurants around Paris. It is vibrant, fun, local! Full of small cafes and marches of every sort. An absolute joy for your culinary senses. There are also loads of little shops for everything from vintage clothes to the latest fashions for both men and women. Be warned. It is expensive. It is also in walking distance to many great Paris attractions and easy to catch the metro or a taxi. But what surprised me most is that despite how exciting and lively the area is, it can also be quiet and extremely charming, especially when going for your morning cafe and breakfast. Visiting or staying in the Marais is an absolute must!!!"

It was a fast and furious day which began at the Eiffel Tower and ended in Le Marais. Our son knew what he was doing - having walked and queued at all the famous tourist spots in Paris during the day we were booked to travel to London on the Eurostar at 9pm - our son planned the day so that we would finish wandering the gorgeous Marais district and finishing with a meal there. It was such a treat - a feeling of elegance, quintessential Paris and calm after a very hectic day. We sat for an hour at a delightful bar \"acting like a couple of Parisiennes\", resting and just taking in the incredible life of this great city in one of its most beautiful arrondissements ! We found dinner at a Entrecout - Excellent steak, frits and salad with the most speedy and efficient service. we also managed some shopping in Le BHV Marais and purchased chocolates to take home from Alain Ducasse. All of this with enough time to comfortably board the Eurostar for a 9pm departure. A visit to Le Marais would definately be on my must do list for a visit to Paris."

The area is what I should think is typically Parisian, tall buildings,narrow street a cafe on every corner. You find better value if you wander a little way off the main drag but I suppose that applies to most cities. The metro is so good you can explore where you like in the city with ease.

Also, you can find the Museum of Picasso, The National Archives and some much smaller art galleries. If you want to party, there are a lot of bars, night clubs.

Our location was very close to Metro and Bus lines. However, it is so close to the islands, St Germain, Latin Quarter, and the Louvre that we walked almost everywhere. The restaurants in the area were awesome. The shopping was great. Almost didn't have to leave our area it was so wonderful! Great bars and night life without feeling unsafe."

Perfect neighborhood on Rue Rambuteau with everything one would need for breakfast, lunch and dinner...also a bank, pharmacy and chocolate. Walking distance to the Cluny (Left Bank), the Picasso museum (Right Bank), Les Rosiers (quaint narrow rue for walking and seeing what Paris used to look like before the 19th century), Place des Vosges, Hotel de Ville, etc etc.Rent an apartment if you can and stay for at least a week. Yes, Paris is an expensive city to live in, but less expensive than, say, San Francisco, CA. You can easily get by for lunch with a gorgeous sandwich from Hur\u00e9, a bakery on Rue Rambuteau. Or if you'd like an inexpensive meal, try one of the bars or cafes. If you've got the bucks, there are more restaurants of high quality than you have time to enjoy in a week. In Le Marais, if you are a walker, you will be delighted to find that you can get to numerous highlights of Paris (on the Right Bank) quickly. There is always the Metro (unless the French transportation workers are striking which is something that does happen--the right to strike is written in the French constitution). In a single morning stroll, we managed to see two world-famous cathedrals (not Notre Dame Paris but others), the Victor Hugo Museum, Les Vosges, and Hotel de Ville and the delightful carousel. Be sure to look for Florence Kahn's deli and other authentic sites."

It's a lot of fun, several restaurants of different styles of food and ambience, some quite exotic, not to mention delicious boulangeries with fresh bread and omelettes (it was my number one program on Sunday). The area is full of art galleries, an interesting photo museum, and the more you walk the nicer little shops you find, making it a very charming and seducing walk from Marais to Centre Georges Pompidou. The \u00cele de Saint-Louis, located just across the bridge from Cit\u00e9 des Arts over the Seine River, with its typical bookinistes, book sellers, offers a number if caffes and restaurants, wine and jewelry as awell as antique shops. Your eyes won't get enough of it, till you reach Notre Dame. I loveso much the place that I had to write a bit about it but the real fun is to discover by yourself the little corners and delucacies of romantic Paris town, specially at the Marais 4\u00e8me!

I recommend starting at the Place de la Bastille and walking down rue St. Antoine, turning right into the Place des Vosges...beautiful. A good thing to note here is that the shops and cafes are under an arcade, so this is a good option for a drizzly day meal or drink. Exit the Place des Vosges from the northwest corner and go down to the Musee Carnavalet, then turn left and just wander around, making your way down to the Seine."

I felt it was very well located, close to the Saint-Paul Metro (line 1) which seemed to take me almost everywhere I needed to go. Also close to the Sully Morland Metro stop (line 7). Good bus routes; 69 and 86 were the ones I used most often. As others have said, the Marais is very crowded on a Sunday. There is a lot to do and see. I found good restaurants, a multitude of boulangeries, fruit stands and places to grab a quick bite to bring back to the apartment. All I could need was right outside my door. I felt very safe at all times of the day and night. The only thing drawback was that my rental apartment was noisier than I'm used to (I live in the woods, it's pretty quiet). My apartment windows faced an interior courtyard, so there was no street noise. But with my windows open, I could hear the conversations of my neighbors who also had their windows open. The interior courtyard acted as an amplifier. I could hear dishes being taken out of cupboards, cutlery clinking, etc. My neighbors were pretty considerate, no late partying, etc. Just normal daily living noises that I'm not used to hearing. I suppose if I lived in a city full-time , I wouldn't have noticed the noise at all. This is probably pretty common to anywhere in a city where the windows open to an interior courtyard. Not a knock or criticism on the Marais at all! Just a comment that if you think you'll be in a quieter apartment if your windows open to a courtyard rather than the street, it might not be as quiet as you think. With the windows closed, I heard little noise. But if you like fresh air, you'll hear your neighbors. On my next visit to Paris, I'd return to Le Marais. It feels like home."

Very hilly so if you walk everywhere which we did you can eat the wonderful pastries and breads without worrying too much about gaining weight. The locals are in great shape! Montmartre is so beautiful with amazing atmosphere. I could not stop taking photos. If you use the subway (Abbess Metro) is very close and easy to use you may see musicians every evening performing - we did."

Caf\u00e9s serving coffee or tasty local dishes and smallish shops are everywhere. The Seine is but 3 blocks away. Paris is a jewel with some parts polished and others in the rough. Have fun!

It turns out to be cheaper and way more spacious than a dinky three star hotel. They usually require a minimum of a three night stay. My favorite square is Place des Vosges. You will stumble on so many great small restaurants. Never had a bad meal. You are in walking distance to the Pompidou center and the charming Picasso museum along with several other great small museums like the Carnavalet. So many cafes to spend hours people watching.

The street itself was perfect, being a quiet spot to unwind after busy days checking out the city. The Marais has wonderful character and some interesting spots to check out, such as the Carnavalet (history of Paris), and the Musee National Picasso, and the Centre Pompidou (modern art) just steps away. Walk to Place des Vosges and check out Victor Hugo's former home, or just enjoy people watching. The Place de la Bastille is close by (although not there's not much to see there any more) and there are tons of little shops and restaurants everywhere. When you get hungry, you must try the falafel at L'As du Falafel (worth the line-up, which is always there) or sit down and try the boeuf bourguignon at Les Philosophes. These streets are quite old and atmospheric! Go for a romantic stroll on the Seine after dinner.You are always only a few minutes from a metro station (St. Paul's, Hotel de Ville, Les Chatelets, etc,) to take you in any direction, whether it's Montmartre, the Eiffel Tower or the Champs Elysees. Other spots such as Notre Dame or the Louvre are an easy walk away. Bertie's Cupcakes, on Rue Chanoinesse around the corner from Notre Dame is a must-see if you have a hankering for a sweet. You're also walking distance (albeit a little longer) from great spots like Saint Sulpice, Luxembourg Palace, the Sorbonne, Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots.I can't think of a better neighbourhood to stay in than the Marais if you want to be surrounded by history, art and the beauty of Paris. Enjoy!"

Even my guide wondered how his group came to explore Le Marais, a district steep in aristocrat legacy and home to those who needed shelter. Le Marais, on the Right Bank starting near H\u00f4tel de Ville is a vibrant district of shops, gastronomy and art galleries. It\u2019s quite a trendy district, with many outwardly attractions but also holds many hidden corners and secrets, which is why a walking tour with a local guide was worth it. For instance, I would not have ventured into Square Saint-Gilles du Grand Veneur which is peaceful enclave surrounded by residential apartments. There are many many secrets like this in Le Marais. Hence the allure.For Le Marais, I decided to join a walking tour organised by Discovery Walks Paris. One of the thing that attracted me to them was the idea that their guides are Parisians who have lived there, grew up there and therefore better suited to share the more intimate secrets about the city. For Le Marais, that local knowledge is crucial.Place des Vosges was once meant to be the royal residence and here lived the aristocrats and noblemen at the time. This is one of the prettiest squares I\u2019ve seen in Paris and felt incredibly local. The arcades along Place des Vosges is lined with many discoveries. Even the cafes look so incredibly tempting to me. I like how they look up into the garden square, as the garden is actually one of the prettiest in my opinion in Paris.I was surprised to note that the Marais district did not underwent the big renovations of the Haussmann era. Which means I would be able to appreciate Paris before its current signature look. In one corner of Place des Vosges is a backdoor entrance to the gardens of H\u00f4tel de Sully. It\u2019s not exactly a hotel, but was once the private mansion of Sully, the right hand to the King. He had bought this place to be close to his patron, King Henri IV.When my guide mention that Marais is a trendy district, he wasn\u2019t kidding. As we sat here at Place Sainte-Catherine for a 5 mins break, the number of swanky Parisians, no doubt heading out to the cafes and bistros that lined this square. It\u2019s off the busier shopping streets which makes it a great hideaway from the traffic and shoppers.Hidden under the radar in between Rue de Francs Bourgeois and Rue des Rosiers is a pretty little park, the Rosiers-Joseph Migneret Garden. What was interesting about this garden is that parts of the medieval wall of 12th-century Paris still exists and integrate with its newer buildings.Rue des Rosiers is filled with chic boutiques notable for the trendiest fashion from interesting independent labels. It\u2019s in the heart of the Jewish quarter, \"the Pletzl\u201d and the fashion boutiques extend to several adjoining streets. You can really see gentrification at work here. This used to be the heart of the Jewish community. My guide pointed to the example of a famous Jewish bakery in one of the corners which is now a clothing boutique. The original signboards and ornaments remain, perhaps to borrow some authenticity, preserving some semblance of legacy and history in the process."

Unfortunately it is more crowded with tourists than it ever was and their time is it negotiating the sidewalks is very difficult. But it hasn't lost its charm every year there are more hotels that have been renovated and give a beautiful picture of Paris in the 17th and 18th century. The caf\u00e9s and restaurants are a lot more upscale and expensive than they used to be but there still charming. The Archives Nationales, the Musee Carnavalet, and the Place des Vosges are not to be missed."

We took the train to the Chatelet Les Halles and after a stroll through a nearby street market , we headed toward the Pompidou Center and the Marais beyond. It was a sunny and about 16 degrees C and the narrow twisting streets were filled with a mixture of tourists and Parisians. Many of the streets took on the appearance of a pedestrian mall and people moved aside with the occasional passing of a taxi or other vehicle. Some people were shopping while many were eating food as they walked with falafel sandwiches and gelato seeming to be the most popular choices among many possibilities. There didn't seem to be as many sidewalk cafes as in other areas of Paris but the major focus of the people seemed to be the unhurried strolling along the streets with stops to listen to very talented street musicians or at a museum or to window shop. Everyone seemed to be grateful to be in Paris in such a beautiful area on such a great day. We had no special agenda and for 5 hours, just followed our instincts [ with an eye to our map] and eventually found our way back to the train station and then home."

Crowded and lively, start at one of the cafes. Then it's on to a beautiful public square near Victor Hugo's house, art galleries, fashionable stores, and of course the Jewish part of the neighborhood with Judaica shops, bakeries, and several falafal stands. \"The best falafel in the world,\" said one of the servers taking pre-orders from the long line of people. I asked, \"What about in Israel?\" And he said, \"Better, because we are in France where we know food!\" We had just eaten too many hamentashen (cookies for the Jewish holiday of Purim) from a bakery to fit in falafel, but since the hamentashen were the best I ever had (including my mother's and 2 Purims spent in Israel), I believe him!"

About the latter: everyone seems to smoke in the cafes, and it can be unpleasant outdoors if you don't. In fact, walking on the narrow streets you'll be treated to a lot of cigarette smoke anyway, much of it emanating from the cafes and much from passers-by. Sit indoors to avoid it when eating. Point two: the Marais is the epicenter of gay life in Paris, and some streets and corners get nearly blocked on weekend nights by large groups of gay men simply congregating, smoking and having a good time. If that makes you uncomfortable, stay away, but you'll be missing a scene that is intrinsic to the Marais."

I wanted to know more about the Marais district, so I booked an Eye Prefer Paris tour, as from their reviews it looks like it's the tour they specialize in. My husband and I met Richard at the Saint Paul metro stop and first thing was he gave us a map of the Marais, which was very useful. Richard was warm and friendly and also funny. He said there were mandatory stops on the tour for free chocolate samples and for pastry and coffee at an award winning bakery. My husband and I are big foodies, so the pastry and chocolate stops were great. Richard showed us all the wonderful food shops in the Marais and we especially loved the Mid-east gourmet shop Izrael, where i picked up a few things plus another shop that only sold foie-gras. Richard also pointed out some of his favorite restaurants in the area, and we enjoyed lunch at one of them after the tour. We learned a lot of interesting history which I didn't know before and also saw a delightful hidden rose garden we never would have found on our own. I will definitely take another Eye Prefer Paris tour again soon."

The place was a little shady and looking around, I was the only Asian within 500 ft. As we proceeded deeper in Le Marais, I noticed men looking at me. Then the woman with me said, \" Le Marais is the gay district of Paris.\"No wonder everything looks fabulous. I noticed all those gay bars and men trying to pick up men.

The shopping is really outstanding in this area and I'd advise spending some time in the many boutique stores here to discover why Paris is known for its fashion. Another thing that I feel is really important is to go to Hotel De Ville first and input that as a location to reach in your map. I used the standard Tripadvisor location marked and while it takes you there the point is definitely not as impressive as Hotel De Ville."

Adventurouskate.com (a blog) gave us lots of great info, including where to stay in Paris-I highly recommend reading her blog posts to find what you are looking for. We took her advice and found a tiny place on airbnb right in the heart of Le Marais! Le Marais is fab: several great restaurants, lots of boutique shops and vintage shops, the BHV (a large Parisian dept store), vintage shops, and walking distance to many metro stations. The vibe in this neighborhood is wonderful! Walking distance to Notre Dame, Hotel de Ville, Centre Pompidou, the Picasso Museum, Shakespeare and Co bookshop and caf\u00e9, St. Chapelle, and more! When I return to Paris I will stay in Le Marais again."

Today the Pompideau attracts thousands of tourists (for good reason,) but the neighborhood remains chic, but still charming, with narrow streets full of small boutiques and cafes, a few boutique hotels (Le Petit Marche!,) but no crowds like you find on the Left Bank. The Picasso Museum is a wonderful addition. If I could live anywhere in Paris, it would be right here."

If cobbled streets and narrow alleys are what you envision the city to be, then this is your cup of tea. But this district (Arrondissement 3) doesn't have the vibrancy and energy of others like the Latin Quarter (Arrondissement 5) or Saint Germain (Arrondissement 6), which some feel are more touristy than Le Marais. Regardless of what you're looking for, all the aforementioned neighborhoods are worth a visit to see every facet of Paris."

Shopping is great, there are fewer designer stores and a lot of eclectic stores. Food is cheaper and the variety is also better. Make sure you take note of your position or get a map... It is very easy to get lost here with many lanes and tall buildings there is little to navigate from as landmarks ate hard to get a glimpse of. I got lost several times. It is close to Notre Dame. One place to really challenge you is the metro at Chatelet and des Halles. A labyrinth to say the least. All you men out there please do ask directions or you will have a long walk and be exhausted after simply finding the correct exit. This is a good place to stay if you are visiting the maison object trade fair as the metro goes straight there. No need for cabs etc and then you are back in the heart of Paris instead of being stuck out at the airport or Villpinte with nothing to do. Metro costs 17.50 return for two to the exposition center"

It also houses an outstanding science/technical museum, Arts et Metiers, that began in 1799. as well as Place Vosges, a 17th century residential square now full of shops, galleries and restaurants.

Originally a muddy marshland ( marais means marsh), until Henri IV drained the area and built the Place Royale in 1605, the area is one of Paris' oldest and most atmospheric quarters. Once the area of the birthplace of the French Revolution, the district sank into disrepair until renewal in the 1960's. Now the location of museums, restored mansions, and narrow streets lined with cafes and restaurants, the area is a wonderful place to discover a genuine Paris neighborhood.

I purchased a lot of Christmas presents that are so lovely and unique, and I would recommend a day wandering around just to see the boutiques and food shops.

In fact, it is now one of the 'chic' places to live.Not sure how I feel about the expensive boutiques mixing in with the old charm, however.Because the area is so old, many buildings need to be renovated and sometimes the modern additions take away from the area. There is so much history there -- from the Place des Vosages to the Hotel de Ville. The museum (which I will review later) details the significance of the area throughout the years... But, it is the more recent history of the lives lost during WWII and lately, that hit you. The monuments of the poor souls are an emotional wake-up call. (Particularly, with armed guards walking near the Temple and streets.) It is a sad statement that some things never change..."

In my late 50s I seem to be wise and don't need to see everything. I am more in the mood of appreciating things while remaining as curious and interstellar as I have always been. Le Marais is a living neibourhood where actual people live and business's are carried on daily. I love witnessing the xchanges between salespersons and clients, waiters with varying style serving different clienteles and more ethnic surroundings. This is the reall world and not a show given for tourists. I love my last visit and intend on spending more time nxt time in Paris. I probably would even be looking for a hotel in the area next time."

One would have to deliberately avoid it in order to miss it. The Picasso Museum is there. The Jewish Art Museum is there. The Shoah Memorial Museum is there. And lots of famous upscale and casual restaurants (like falafel places) are there. It's beautiful. It's clean. It used to be the heart of Jewish life in Paris, and that history still remains even though most of the Jews have since moved.The reason I rate it only 3 stars is because it is crowded and touristy. I almost stayed in Le Marais, and I'm so glad I didn't. My experience of Paris would have been vastly different, with expensive boutique shopping on every street and the bustling of tourist life on every corner. Le Marais is not where the Parisians are; it's not where they live or where they hang out -- any more than Champs de Elysses is -- any more than Times Square is for New Yorkers. One will pass through. One will even go to Le Marais itself. It's lovely, but it gets old. Sure, there are great bakeries there, but there are great bakeries all over Paris (one of my favorites was in the 20th Arrondissement, which is very Parisian). I went to a few of the falafel places; I went to the Shoah Memorial, the Musee Picasso, and the Jewish Art Museum. I also went to some higher end restaurants. It's near-impossible not to pass through. I loved it, but all the same, I was happy to leave it once I was done with why I had come."

It was a great area to be based. we stayed 5 minutes from Notre Dame. Lots of bars, shopping and could just wander around at night if we pleased. There are a lot of apartments available, and we ended up staying in Rue Quincampoix in a ground floor apartment ( called the Edmund Michelet) rented through \"The French Experience\" based in Sydney Australia. We had no problems at all. Subway close by, walking distance to Notre Dame, Saint Chapelles Church, The Lourve, we even walked down to the arc and then got the subway back. There was s supermarket for us, practically at our doorstep which I had researched prior, (this is handy to know if your hiring an apartment, saves running around trying to find it once there)We went to the new shopping centre called Las halles. Most of this is underground. We got lost. At closing time we just followed the crowd, we were so pleased when we felt a cold breeze coming in our direction.

Once a center of Jewish life in Paris, the Marais many (most?) of its Jewish inhabitants to rounds ups and \"transportation\", with the willing complicity of the Vichy French government. Today, the Marais abounds with shops and restaurants and a busy street scene. The Centre Pompidou is here for those interested in modern art. Restaurants and small food shops are mixed with galleries and clothing stores. For those who love falafel, try the rue du Rosiers for good eats."

To my way of thinking, it is the perfect fit for a first time or long time visitor. It is very central for a tourist as it is only a block or two from the Seine River, and its wonderful quai-side walks, Ile St. Louis and Ile de la Cit\u00e9, with its treasures of Notre Dame, La Chapelle, and the Conciergerie. The Louvre, the Centre Pompidou, the Picasso Museum, and Place des Vosges are all within walking distance. For those who prefer the metro, the main line (#1) runs through the area and can whisk you off to Place de la Concorde, The Petit and Grand Palais art museums, the Champs Elys\u00e9es, and the Arc de Triomphe without needing to take a correspondence (a transfer). The Marais is stocked with small streets full of centuries old buildings and good restaurants that won`t strip your budget. It is a real area, where people actually live, not just offices, tourist attractions, and pricey hotels. It has an atmosphere which I very much like and I would never consider staying anywhere else during my Paris visits. While in Paris find a reasonably priced Marais hotel on the internet, relax, and enjoy your stay - to my way of thinking the Marais has everything you will need to make your stay enjoyable and memorable. Personally, I usually stay in one of numerous smaller hotels in the area where Rue de Rivoli and Rue St. Antoine meet, near the m\u00e9tro station St. Paul."

The apartment was a block from the Centre Pompidou and was a 15 minute walk to Notre Dame Cathedral. There were two great bakeries on our street and numerous restaurants. We walked down to the Place des Vosges and lingered in the park there and browsed at a nice neighborhood flea market. On Sunday, the streets were closed to traffic and it seemed like half of Paris was there strolling around. The street performers that I remember most was a quartet playing Dixieland jazz. Le Marais was a great location to stay on our first trip to Paris."

It is a wonderful area, great and unique shops, interesting museums (some free), very old buildings, good restaurants and simply a wonderful walk through Paris. The best way to do it for free is to google Framers walking tours of Paris #3 - make sure you get the map which is on the web site. It does not matter where you start - we liked the Hotel deVille (Hotel is the name of a mansion not a Hotel as we know it), once you get started following the written directions is very easy. Hint - several times they give specific street numbers, frequently these are the very old numbers but in all cases very close to the new number and on the same side of the street. You will see some wonderful churches, oldest wooden houses in Paris, Musee Picasso (ok not great), Musee Carnavalet (free) and Victor Hugo House (free) and squares and gardens in front of the mansions. . Make sure you walk completely around the place des vosges as it is very interesting and where the Hugo house is located. A few spectacular art shops - not to worry too expensive to buy but great to look at. we spent the whole day here."

There are lots of amazing buildings, structures, little gardens with fountains, and above all wonderful narrow streets with all sorts of shops, great fast food places, and restaurants. You will not get tired of walking in this neighborhood for hours and taking some of your best Paris pictures. Relax for 10-15 minutes in the beautiful Place Des Vosges peaceful park and be amazed by its beautiful surrounding building. If you have your sandwiches with you, you can have a nice picnic over there. After you go through a beautiful and old arch, you get to Hotel De Sully, which is another marvelous structure in Le Marais. Next get on the narrow streets and enjoy a nice walk and some window shopping, if you like. Carnavalet Museum is another place to see, but it was closed and we could not get in. As you walk on one the streets in the 4th district, stop by the Amorino ice cream parlor and enjoy one of the best ice cream cones in Paris. Finally, make sure you see the Hotel De Ville when you are in Le Marais and again be amazed by this absolutely breath taking structure and its beautiful fountains. This building is simply a must see in Paris. Now, complete your walk with a nice dinner in one of the cozy restaurants in this gorgeous neighborhood. Have fun!"

Despite comments from other travellers, we found the locals very friendly and found lovely little cafes with wonderful new food delights. The rail transport was convenient. One of the local streets were closed so the residents could have a street party so the city folk could get to know their neighbours.

It is the 4th Arrondissment and is easily accessible by Paris's extremely efficient metro system (you can get off at St Paul, Ch\u00e2telet, Hotel de Ville or Louvre-Rivolli along the yellow line -line 1 to easily access it). The Marais is the Jewish district and it is filled with scrumptious bakeries with many Jewish delights as well as normal baked goods like croissants, pain au chocolate etc. I definitely recommend a walk along Rue de Rivoli (the main street) however there are many cute streets just off it around the St Paul area. Great authentic Parisian cafes. Visit the area at night or by day, and make sure you visit it whether you're here for a day or a week. I stayed via Air BnB in the Marais and I just love it. If you get an accommodation with kitchen space and have the implements to cook, I recommend that, it saved a lot of money!"

Transportation to anywhere is easy from here (but probably easy from most places in the city centre) and the scale is human, whereas parts are so grand as to be less manageable. As soon as one steps off the Rue de Rivoli, the streets are quieter and in most places, it feels very local, rather than just touristy. Wonderful, hidden gems lurk everywhere, and one feels as though one is making a special discovery, though it is clear that many thousands do the same. Fantastic food everywhere. The first shop I've seen devoted entirely to honey. Wonderful neighbourhood to explore and to stay in, if you have the chance."

It's also not far from Centre Pompidou. And, there are some neat little restaurants tucked away. A faire!"

Le Marais is a wonderful olde worlde quarter of Paris with a host of restaurants of every type and flavour and a mix of cultures. We had been keen to show it to our kids as we remembered it fondly from previous visits and in many ways it was as good as ever. But. Sadly it has become necessary for the armed French genarmerie to guard not only local places of worship, notably synagogues, but to have armed police outside every kosher shop and restaurant. On the one hand it was good to see them take things so understandably seriously, but on the other it did stop us in our tracks and it was hard to explain why they were needed there to our 7 year-old. Despite that we had a lovely meal and still look fondly on this quaint area of Paris."

Place des Vosges used to be full of fab shops but now it is mostly very expensive galleries and cafes but the architecture is just sublime. I think this is one of Paris's treasures. If you want a traditional French meal at affordable price, go to Cafe des Vosges here, not all the other fancy cafes.

Before King Louis XIV built Versailles French aristocrats had their Parisian mansions there. Then they followed the kings to Versailles. On the superb, unique Place des Vosges, our great writer Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 was born and in the XIXth century our greatest writer Victor Hugo lived there. His home is now a wonderful museum (free entrance) that I recommand. Its view over the square is really beautiful. Further on, The Carnavalet Museum (40 rooms on the history of Paris), the home of Mme de S\u00e9vigny when she was married, is worth a visit to discover a 17th century Parisian mansion. The Marais is a district very popular with Parisians for elegant shopping. A must in Paris"

At least they left up the Goldenberg restaurant sign."

The Jewish museum was worth the walk to find though security there was tight. Need more time to explore on our next visit."

Now in modern times, with a touch of irony, Le Marais has become tres chic, trendy and packed full of eateries, cafes, shops and museums. It really has so many things to see and do. I would recommend having a physical map of the area or internet access for an online one, so as not to get lost in the winding curving streets (if you're trying to find somewhere in particular), otherwise feel free to lose yourself in the delight and hubbub of this stylish arrondissement."

There is also the convenience of many metro stations - Saint Paul is on Line 1 as is Hotel de Ville. Chatelet is also in tjis area.If you love 2nd hand clothing shops this area is definitely for you. There are also many many good eating places and coffee shops. Our favourite is in Rue Rivoli opposite Hotel de Ville and it is called Cafe Bio.They use organic coffee and many different types of milk are available. They are close to Starbucks but a million times better and yes they do have a toilet available downstairs.The Jewish quarters are in the Marais so some great Jewish food.

Notre Dame, Pompideau, shopping and eating were fun and friendly. The local shop keepers knowing we were tourists still gave us equal service.....just speak a little French as it makes all the difference. We ventured to the Jewish quarter and it was a step back in time. We felt safe the entire time, and it was not our imagination. I spoke with a high end vintage shop keeper at length who said we are a safe neighborhood (25 Javier) on Rue de Temple. I recommend the Maris to any family or couple.

There are boutique shops, restaurants and grocery markets for ease and convenience. The only reason it's not a 5 for us is we were treated rudely when buying groceries or shopping. I get the feeling the people who live there do not like tourists, especially those who speak English. We travel often, love meeting people, and usually give people the benefit of the doubt. If you are accustomed to people being gracious and welcoming, you should prepare yourself for a different experience."

The French were part of the sad events that took place during the time of WWII. The part that was so impressive is the block long panel with names all the people that were taken unjustly by the French. The Police are a strong presence since there are still those that want to create chaos.They are friendly but very cautious. it is a lovely part of Paris."

We don't come here to shop, and eating isn't a primary focus either. We just enjoy seeing the neighborhoods and mixing and mingling with the crowds. The Marais is a great place to do that. Wander up and down the streets. Check out the Place des Vosges. Take a quick tour of the Carnavalet, or duck into an out of the way church that isn't in anybody's guidebook. Grab lunch in a place that's more local than touristy. We spent the better part of two full days here during a recent extended trip to Paris. We were there in daylight and evenings. I'm sure there are dark corners you wouldn't want to blunder into at night, but that's no more true here than anywhere else. Enjoy a trip through this interesting quarter."

How do you decide where to start?Well, you won't go far wrong of you choose the Marais district to begin your walking and wandering.The streets here are smaller, narrower, more intimate than much of Paris with its grandness and scale. Take the metro (it really is easy) and get out at St Paul or Bastille (yellow line). Wander Rue de Rivoli. Head down the wee cobbled streets, past designer clothing, shoes, artisans. Past cafes and patisseries, book shops and antique dealers. Pop into churches or down covered alleys into new wee streets. Lovely, human-scale and busy but with French life, rather than teaming with tourists like the lovely St Germaine area.I won't stay in any other part of the city ever again - look at the Grand Malher hotel if you want to stay in Marais - perfect location and cheaper than much of Paris, for the equivalent quality..."

This district, centrally located, is one of the areas which escaped Baron Haussmann's redevelopment of Paris in the 19th century, so is full of little, narrow, winding streets and loaded with character.It has had quite a history, being a wealthy area, then down at heel, then a Jewish area and now, very trendy and popular with younger people and the gay set. There are lots of caf\u00e9s, bars, Jewish delicatessens and Arab cuisine. Also, there are lots of fancy, innovative boutiques, menswear shops, artists studios and artisan jewellers. You can window shop for days.There are also museums, such as the Carnavalet, the Picasso museum and the Pompidou centre. The Place des Vosges is one of the most beautiful squares in Paris, fringed by galleries and caf\u00e9s. It's one of the few places in Paris where you are allowed to walk on the grass.It's a good idea to take a walking tour, as the area is reasonably compact, but contains lots of secrets which come alive when explained. Later, you can wander around aimlessly, with no plan in mind and just see where your feet take you. It's perfect for that. It's also the home of Jaques Jenin, the famous chocolatier, where you can try their rich, bitter hot chocolate, or buy their handmade, scrumptious chocolates.I keep coming back to this area, time after time and on the last two visits, have stayed here. It's probably my favourite area in Paris."

This quartier oozes history, but doesn't most of Paris? Victor Hugo wrote masterpieces and Jim Morrison spent his last hours in the Marais. My husband and I headed to la Place des Vosges, the heart of the marsh and a lovely park that was crowded with picnic-ers and children practicing cartwheels on this sunny Saturday (May 30th). We stopped at Nectarine (16 place des vosges) for lunch on the terrace overlooking the park where the service was warm and welcoming and the food, tasty. As we crossed the street back to the park, we passed a young musician playing classical guitar in a doorway. It all tugged at my francophile heartstrings as I bid farewell to one of my favorite places on the planet.One museum in le Marais, Arts et Metiers (located near metro stop by the same name), is often overlooked by visitors yet worth a visit if you are into history, and especially the history of science and industry (pls. see my review of it from last year). Of course, the Marais is home to many musees that are worth a leisurely visit, such as the newly renovated Picasso Museum and the Carnavalet Museum (free for visitors) which showcases the history of the city of Paris. I recommend budgeting time and a few euros for their gift shops. Do not miss the Archives Nationales where historical documents are on display, showing signatures of Jeanne d'Arc and Charlemagne, among others. And you must stop by 34 rue des rosiers at the L\u2019As du Fallafel for lunch; be prepared to stand in line for a while, but much like Ste. Chapelle, it is worth the wait!"

It is full of historic displays and artwork related to the history of France. The cafes in this area are bustling but the service is quite attentive, personable and even entertaining in some cases.We did see two soldiers in one of the main squares with automatic weapons, which served as a stark reminder that the attacks earlier this year happened in that general area. But this did not feel menacing, simply protective.Having seen many areas of Paris before, I can say this is one of my favorites...there is no heavy traffic to worry about, it is not noisy, and it has the coherence of a city within a city.

'Le Marais' means 'the marsh' & it was once a marsh before it was drained & filled; it's the 3rd & 4th arrondissements of Paris and is the most beautiful part of the city -- the only part completely untouched by Baron Haussmann's massive demolition & reconstruction of the city under the reign of Napoleon III. The heart of the Marais is the enchanting Place des Vosges, the largest public square in the quarter. From it, you can walk west down the rue des Francs Bourgeois to explore the rest of the area. The best streets to explore are the rue des Francs Bourgeois, the rue Vielle du Temple, the rue des Archives & the rue des Rosiers -- the main street of the old Jewish quarter. There are dozens of great 'h\u00f4tels particuliers' -- grand mansions from the 16th, 17th & 18th centuries -- including the H\u00f4tel Carnavalet, which houses the Mus\u00e9e de la Ville de Paris; the H\u00f4tel Sal\u00e9, which houses the Mus\u00e9e Picasso; the H\u00f4tel Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud, which houses the Mus\u00e9e de la Chasse et de Nature; and the H\u00f4tel de Soubise, which houses the Mus\u00e9e de l'Histoire de France & the exquisite Salon de la Princesse, a Rococo masterpiece. Make sure to see the H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris City Hall, which is a 19th century copy of the French Renaissance original and which is one of the most beautiful buildings in Paris."

Rue de Rivoli felt like one of the main streets. I don't have perspective into other arrondissements, but in Marais, I felt like a Parisian. Lots of locals stopping at the boulangerie to get bread and start their day. Children out and about in the morning. I don't know if I would explore Le Marais if I had less than a week in Paris. You might want to see the Pompidou which borders Marais. There are some other classic hotels and museums in Marais. We also ate an awesome Jewish restaurant that had very moist, savory falafel. Best meal my fiancee had in Paris."

It is my favorite part of Paris - great food, wonderful shops, and a collection of lesser known, but truly fascinating museums (Musee Picasso, Carnavalet, Art et Metiers, and many more).The Marais is the oldest section of Paris, the original home of the Knights Templar. It is rich in history and heritage, filled with interesting architecture, and, lately, with trendy boutiques, avant garde galleries, and much more.You could easily spend a month in this part of town and not experience it all.

The place was jammed packed with tourists. We found the shopping to be disappointing in that regard. But my review isn't a full one since there are a lot of other things to do in Le Marais. Place des Vosges a busy little park to get some sun. There are a few well known smaller museums as well.

We arrived in Paris on a Sunday and the concierge of our hotel directed us to \"Le Marais\" to get something to eat. This is the old Jewish area of the city and still holds most of the Kosher restaurants. The thing is, since many of the shops and restaurants in other areas of the city are closed on Sunday, Le Marais gets filled with all types of shoppers and diners. We ate at Mike's Diner. I had an excellent hot pastrami sandwich and my husband ordered a chicken burger which surprisingly came with a sunny-side up egg on top of the patty, under the bun. There are many nice stores there- Zadig and Voltaire, a kind of upscale Zara type store, Ted Baker and a bunch of vintage clothing stores. If you're going to shop vintage clothing, I think Paris is a good place to do it. A nice area, great if you are looking for Kosher food or synagogues, or if you are a would-be Sunday shopper or diner looking for places to go. Go by metro or cab as I didn't see too much parking around."

Popped inside to the Museum of French History and of French Archives for a quick look then continued on down rue des Francs Bourgeois until I came to rue Elzevir, turned left into this and saw the welcome sign 'Hotel Cognacq-Jay.' I stood at this building with high expectations, for I had checked it out on line, and it looked great. However, a workman said, \"Not open, closed.\" I was not happy! There was no mention of that on line in English, and I just checked again now, and there still isn't! However, in French translation - it says \"Opening May 9, 2015.\" So walking on I came to Hotel Carnavalet, the Musee of Paris. This is well and truly worth a look. Continuing straight on I eventually came across the Place des Vosges, the famous beautiful Park Square, with its very old rich houses. Finally I went and found the cute Gothic building the Hotel de Sens - now the holder of the Forney Art Library.So, after a cup of coffee at the nearest Cafe- I decided that the Marais was okay. But some time I am going back to the Cognacq-Jay Museum - I just looked it up again, and it looks even better.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia"

During after-work hours around 18ish (which is livelier than in the afternoon), the area is buzzing with people chilling out, sipping their after-work beers or wine, or clanking forks and knives, mixed with bursting laughters of joy. My husband and were walking along the area going through the atmosphere of the cafes/restaurants we passed by. We enjoyed our stroll and stumbled upon some places we never thought we would find. Here, Any cafes there are perfect to sit and watch the world go by. Along the walk, we went through Lopsided building, stone cobbled pavements, small alleys and turns, curved streets and roads that lead to surprises, Le Marais is a lively, vibrant, soulful ancient part of Paris that one has to explore by simply walking. We've been there several times and never got bored."

There is a living room/dining/kitchen area as you walk into the place. The kitchen was compact but had all you could need (no oven), as well as a washer and dryer. The sofa makes into a double bed. TV, phone are provided. The place was absolutely clean and decorated \"Parisian\" style. The bedroom has a double bed. Again, the bedroom is small, but there is a closet, bed, nightstand.

The Marais is vibrant and busy with high end boutiques alongside glitzy cheap jewel stores, restaurants running from Felaffel and Noodle stands to French Haute Cuisine, and of course you have the food market of Les Enfants Rouges. There are the noisy and not very clean main streets on which you will find the Pompidou Center ( I still can't understand what they were thinking when they built it...) and the big Les Halles shopping center but also the lovely little streets, all of them beautiful with small hidden gardens and churches that you just fall upon when strolling in the area. All you have to do is get away from the main streets and walk along the small ones. You are sure to find hidden gems along the way. The cafes are lovely and there are endless pattissiers- boulangers where you must throw caution and calory counting to the wind and enjoy your eclair au chocolat or whatever your choice of pattisserie might be. We booked a vacation rental for our stay in Paris in the Marais and for me it is the best place to live in for a short stay in Paris. Step out in the evening and you have an abundant choice of good restaurants, walk around in the afternoon and watch the elderly petang players in the public neighborhood park, buy your breakfast baguette from the local boulanger, and just feel the vibrancy of the neighborhood. A wonderful place to stay, and if you are staying elsewhere, you can spend a whole day in the Marais and you will probably come back for more."

This was an ideal spot with a couple of boulangeries and a local Carrefour just a few minutes away. The area was great; some excellent small restaurants of every ethnicity, lots of fascinating little shops, two Metro stations within minutes walk and also only minutes away from the Pompidou Centre. I felt very safe in this city and was amazed and pleased by the friendliness and helpfulness of every Parisienne we met. (Not what I remember from previous visits). We walked almost everywhere because it was easy and pleasant, only using the Metro to wend our weary way home a couple of evenings, and for Montmatre and the Sacre Couer. We also used the hop on and off boat which was great for a different view and enabled us to chill a bit while taking in a different perspective. We visited Notre Dame (marvellous on Sunday to hear the organ and choir in the service), the Tuileries, Place de la Concorde, Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, Arc de Triomphe, Musee D'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Louvre all were amazing. I recommend an evening trip to the top of the Pompidou Centre to see the shimmering Eiffel Tower, on the hour for five minutes, We breakfasted at home, stopped for coffee breaks, light lunch and evening meal wherever we happened to be. We spent about \u00a3250 each on top of our Eurostar fare and apartment fee. We had a marvellous time and saw and did everything we wished. To be recommended."

And to think that a couple of decades ago, one could have bought an apartment there for a song...Le Marais, the 3rd arondissement, is the old Paris in a modern surroundings. Most of the buildings are old, dating to a few centuries ago. there was even a medieval cloister open to the public along the Rue des Archives.Now that it has become a tourist attraction, the cafes and stores have become a bit pricey and crowded, but you can still enjoy sitting among those ancient buildings sipping a cappuccino and munching a croissant.For the shopping, visit the nearby Rue Saint-Antoine and don't forget to visit the Place des Vosges and a beautiful and cheap eye-glass frame shop on Rue de Birague.Enjoy!"

There are plenty of ways to get there: Bus, Metro, Boat or my favorite - walking down Rue de Rivoli. Walk past the Hotel de Ville (Paris City Hall) and emerge yourself in some great window shopping. Eventually on your left you will see signs leading to Le Marais. A wonderful mostly Jewish neighborhood full of shops and restaurants. The streets are typical Paris - every corner you turn leads to something interesting. As a history student I stop along Rue de Rosiers, remembering this is where the Vichy and Nazis rounded up the Paris Jews. They were then sent to Drancy and later onto Auschwitz. The sadness I feel is lifted by being there and seeing this now vibrant community that has survived the worse that Man has to offer. Stop and have a lunch at one of the many venues, visit a shop and spend time in this most extraordinary place, in a most extraordinary city."

Too many choices to write about here (though I have reviewed some eateries here). Do yourself a favor and go discover it for yourself. Simply impossible not to be impressed. Tip! though the streets are closed on weekends (something I longed for for many years. Couldn't believe so much traffic was allowed through those tiny streets) I recommend going during the weekday if possible to avoid the hoards of people, just remember to look out for cars and bicycles when you inevitably have to step off the tiny footpath to get around people taking photos, or just to move forward."

Food in general is cafe-type food, nothing outstanding, but I may not have known where to eat. Galleries are generally not open, but you can still look in the windows.

It is one of the few places in Paris that is open on Sundays. The streets, the open areas (around centre pompedeau) and bustling activities make it pleasurable to visit on Sundays.I heard the place is also very good for the partying scene, though I did not visit any clubs."

Moreover, it is an original Paris neighborhood, one which was not given a new face during the renovations of the 19th Century. Every time I am there, I discover new things. My mouth still waters for the delicious poppy seed pastries of the delis along the main street of the Jewish Quarter. The late night drinks and chocolates in the cafes, the wonderful people so open and friendly, the cheap and friendly wine bars, the great ethnic variety of the eateries in just one neighborhood, and the proximity to a great part of the best of Paris from this neighborhood make the Marais my unquestionable favorite. And yes, if your are young and gay, it is the club scene to end all club scenes. For those who are into shopping for the best brands, and I am not, this is one of the newer venue for all that. To me, this has detracted from the place's original charm and attractiveness. It has also caused prices to soar in cafes and certain, but not all, restaurants. Good news, it is easy to avoid the few main street that cater to the more materialist class. Find the unique and the historic. Explore lanes, and go through open doors into private places. Sit somewhere in the Place Des Voges and listen to the haunting sounds of a cellist playing from an alcove, and imagine the life there 500 years ago. This is still, for me, the best of Paris!! Footnote: one of my favorite life memories is walking a deserted, sparkling, cream-colored, half-lit Marais lane late at night during a sudden, unexpected snowfall--the absolute quiet, the beige snow-flake shadowed light--the sense of place, and the recognition of its timelessness is now, most gratefully, a part of my permanent consciousness."

Within walking distance from so many other interesting areas be sure to visit this area for fantastic food (both taste and price), a great atmosphere and swanky shops. Wander about and visit picturesque Place des Vosges, Pompidou Centre etcRecommended places:- Chez Hanna (Rue de Rosiers) - delicious falafels at very reasonable prices. Be prepared to wait though as this is a popular place.- La Droguerie (Rue de Rosiers) - great priced crepes. Came for lunch and was greeted warmly by the friendly owner. A few seats inside to sit down at or you can take away.- Uniqlo store - in a converted factory this is a must visit for all architects/interior design fanatics. SO COOL.- Various second-hand clothes shops where bargains can be found if you have the patience to trawl through the racks/mountains of clothes- BHV department store - great to wander about, imagining you could have everything- Maison Georges Larnicol chocolate shop - if only you could bottle up the scent of this place. Sells decent-priced macarons too and is a feast for your eyes and nose."

It is located on the Right Bank of the Seine River and parts of it are in both the 3rd and 4th arrondissements. This part of Paris was originally a swamp until it was drained hundreds of years ago. The name of the district is still called \u201cThe Swamp\u201d or Le Marais. This swampy beginning is the opposite of what it is today (a very trendy area).My wife and I have visited this district on other trips and returned for part of one day on this November trip. My wife wanted some shopping time on this trip so we spent part of one our day visiting this charming part of Paris. There are lots of trendy boutiques in this district. There are also some interesting museums in the Marais including the Mus\u00e9e Picasso and the Carnavalet Museum.Le Marais a great place to walk as it has interesting, ancient and windy cobblestone medieval streets. This is one of the few areas in Paris that has retained its small medieval streets. If you get tired after shopping and walking take a break in the beautiful Place des Vosges. This is the oldest and probably the nicest public square in all of Paris. There are lots of benches to sit down and people watch and relax. You will see lots of locals and tourists in this square. You can also visit Victor Hugo\u2019s old home as it is inside this square and is now open as a museum.Overall I really enjoyed strolling through this awesome district in Paris and highly recommend that you visit it when you are in Paris."

It's now very trendy, but the shops have very neighborhood-feel. I was able to go to local candy shops, cheese shops, grocery stores, creperie and best kosher bakeries. The BHV is also a more affordable department store than Galleries LaFayette or the Printemps. There are a lot of knick knacks there that you can't find at higher end shops. Access is quite easy by Metro, by foot or taxi. It's not as far as it seems on the maps. Maybe 20 minute walk from The Louvre. Spend an afternoon there and also eat the best falafels in the area.

The H\u00f4tel de Sens has a cannonball lodged in the wall above the main gate and so do not miss this.http://www.coolstuffinparis.com/cannonball_hotel_de_sens.php"

In summer this would be perfect, but in winter when it us dark by 5pm, and often cold and wet it becomes less appealing- easy to get lost (street signage is limited) and tricky walking on slippery icy cobblestones.

            "review": "Le Marais is a great place to stay for a Paris visit. We rented an apartment for 10 days in Paris on Rue Volta near the Arts et Metier Metro Stop. The Marais is a very old neighborhood with lots of restaurants, other metro stops, grocery stores, bars, and of course the nearby Arts et Metier Museum of Inventions and Mechanical devices. In addition, at #3 Rue Volta (right across from the Laundromat), is the oldest house in Paris according to different sources. It certainly looks it. By the way, do not go late to the laudromat. You'll want to start any laundry before 8PM as they close at 9PM. By the way, to save money and time, it would be quicker to wash your clothes in your apartment and carry them to the Laundromat to put them in the big industrial size dryers that cost 1 Euro for 8 minutes. Our clothes easily dried in 16 minutes. We walked all over the Marais and found many specialty shops including a wonderful Boulangerie-Patisserie across the street, a Monoprix that had really good prices on their food and cheap prices on Diet cokes (in the large Liter bottles), and Champagne for less than 3 Euros per bottle that was wonderful (brand was Montparnasse--just like the tall tower on the South side of France with the observation deck). There is a Carrefour grocery up the street, but we found that although the Monoprix was smaller, it seemed to have better prices and was easier to find stuff. But the Carrefour has all kinds of stuff including a basement with lots of stuff you might need for your apartment. The only caution is that we like to sleep with the windows slightly open if possible during the fall and early winter. We were able to do that as the weather was wonderful in early November, but with the bars and night life, there were several nights where it is obvious that a lot of people in Paris are night owls. Sometimes some inebriated Parisiens would come stumbling down the sidewalk singing in French or yelling in French. But after we realized that night life in Paris is not like the night life in our quiet neighborhood at home, we wore ear plugs and were able to sleep right through the party animals heading home from the bars. No, it didn't remind me of when I was young as I could never stay up but a few minutes after midnight! Musts be nice to be young and in Paris and have the money to go to some those places. One of the restaurants we checked out advertised a Cheeseburger with pomme frites (French fries) on their outdoor chalk board, but the price for this combo (without drink) was 26 Euros. So it must have either been one heck of a big hamburger or it is just the allure of eating American food that would make some one pay that much. The drinks were comparably priced, so it was out of our range. Besides, there are McDonald's in Paris and if you get desperate for a hamburger, you can always go to Mickey D's. No, we never went to one of the McDonald's in Paris, as there were too many restaurants with reasonable prices for local food that was great. Because the Marais is an older neighborhood and not really a touristy area, we never saw that many tourists, nor is there a McDonald's in the Marais (the Third Arrondisement). In some of the stores and restaurants, people spoke English, although our apartment owner did not speak much. So if you plan to stay in this area, you might want to brush up on your French or spend some time learning some of the most common French phrases you'll want to know. If you also need help, almost every young person you meet there is going to speak English. Although many older people don't speak English, most young people do and they are usually glad to have an opportunity to practice. Even the ones that are afraid of making mistakes will jump right into English if you try to ask a question with your French. At that point. Although you hear stories about how the people in Paris are rude, we never ran into a single rude person there. The Paris of old with the reputation for snooty people seems to have disappeared. Or maybe we just didn't go into any rich places where there might be snooty people. I will admit that my wife has a major in French and I've studied French for a year with a lot of emphasis on correct pronunciation of French and a several thousand word vocabulary (no, it's not bragging if it's a fact). That may have helped, but I'd encourage anyone who visits a foreign country to at least make sure they know the basic greetings and what is considered polite. Just as an example, anytime you enter any store in France, you always acknowledge the clerk and say Bonjour and they will acknowledge you and respond in kind. Never walk into a store and just walk by the clerk without greeting the clerk when you come in. That is considered rude on your part and you might be treated rudely even though you don't realize how rude you've been. A little preparation goes a long way if you want to put your best foot forward, which I would hope we all want to do when we are visiting foreign countries."

The famous baron Haussmann who changed the city in 19th century didn't have time to transforme completly Le Marais. Therefore you can find there lots of private mansions from 16,17and 18th centuries.. Some are museums, some banks, some others administration. It's good to stroll in the area which is not very big. The Carnavalet museum has beautiful section with the original interiors from the destroyed by Haussmann houses and couple of rooms with items from the French Revolution. In October , the Picasso Museum was reopened and it attracts the crowds. I like a more discret museum Cognacq-Jay with a beautiful collection of 18th century paintings in an old private mansion. If you are tired you will find there many nice small restaurants.Le Marais is also the only one part of Paris where the shops are open on Sundays"

So after church, we went to the Pompidou and took in the funky architecture and modern art (not my favorite). By then, we'd worked up a good appetite, and we made our way to the Rue des Rosiers. The whole street had the coolest vibe about it, with several falafel places vying for our custom. Each one had a sign proclaiming it as the best in Paris. We decided to try the one that didn't make that claim, because we admired their humility and honesty. Lo and behold, it really was the best falafel in Paris, or at least the best one we've ever had. I wish I knew the name of it. But it's one of the last ones on the left side of the street. I had the schwarma, which was amazing, and my wife and daughter had the falafel. We loved it so much, we went out of our way on a subsequent day to have them again. A word of warning: don't eat your falafels in front of the little Jewish bookshop on the side street, or you'll get an angry little grandma berating you in French while she pours water on the sidewalk and sweeps away your inevitable spills. We also enjoyed the Place des Vosges and the general sights around Le Marais. Fun part of Paris (as if there are any non-fun parts of Paris)."

There are some great caf\u00e9s / bars here including Rivolux on the rue de Rivoli.You are spoilt for choice with cheese shops, bakers, patisseries, restaurants, wine shops and of course the famous tea house Marriages Freres. If you wandered down rue des Rosiers you will also find long queues for the best falafels ever.Lovely area of Paris with many nooks and crannies to explore - one thing not to miss is to go to rue de Cloche Perche and see one of the last remaining 14th century buildings still standing - gorgeous piece of history tucked in a little corner.There is also a jeweler located there and many fab gifts will be found inside, including some quite clever watches."

Having both been to Paris before this time we wanted to try out the less obvious tourist spots. The tour starts off at Hotel de Ville the facade of which is decorated with 378 works by 230 sculptors, including Rodin.Highlights included:- Eglise St-Gervais-St-Protais which is beautifully gothic in style. It's immense and I was in awe of the people who built it.- No. 11 and no. 13 rue Francois Miron are two half-timbered houses that were built in the 14th century. - H\u00f4tel de Sens - One of the h\u00f4tel's most famous residents was Marguerite de Valois, whose life inspired Alexandre Dumas's 1845 novel La Reine Margot. It looks like something out of Harry Potter but is now home to the Bibliotheque Forney which is open to the public (in the afternoons). - H\u00f4tel de Sully - the interior is not open to the public but it's courtyards are. It is beautiful and reminded me of a mini Versailles. There is an exit at the north-east of the gardens (2nd courtyard) which is a short cut to the beautiful Place des Vosges, where Victor Hugo once lived.- Rue des Rosiers - famous for its delicious falafel I would highly recommend this tour and do stop off for some falafels!"

Everything you need is just outside your door. Transport, supermarkets, restaurants, cafes, shopping, street markets, culture, beauty, history \u2026 the list goes on. We stayed just off Rue de Rivoli and were only a few minutes walk from all of the major attractions, but were far enough away to feel like it was a night time haven. We truly felt as if we were part of the community, and I would never consider staying anywhere else during a stay in Paris."

I was lucky that I found a boutique in a small street selling truly handmade and reasonably priced French fashion and accessories when I was \"lost\" (and I am not sure if I will find this shop again but it is what made Le Marais charming).If you really want some comfort for your orientation, you can try starting from the a-bit-too-famous Rue des Francs Bourgeois where you can find Uniqlo (btw, just go inside the modernly-designed yet historical building to have a look even you are not fan of this brand), Ted Baker, Muji, etc. Rue Vieulle du Temple is another good option.Mariage Fr\u00e8res has a tea house (30 rue du Bourg-Tibourg) and prices are reasonable for decent quality of tea.

Continue Rue Saint-Louis en Ile until Rue des Deux Ponts and then over the bridge towards Marais. Once you get across the brigde, it's time to get lost and just wander around and admire the architecture, do some shopping and just relaxing in cafes.

So much better than a hotel as you're really living right in the middle of \"Paris Life\". The Worlds Best Falafel bar is just around the corner, both of them! However you CANNOT miss Le Eclair de Genie or Meert for their respective sugary delights. Meert sells vanilla butter creme filled waffles that apparently were a favorite of General de Gaulle. You have to try them. Visit Crepe Suzette on the way back if you're coming off your sugar high!Le Eclair de Genie is a great representative of the new craze in Paris, eclairs. The displays are enough to make your drool. The eclairs look like jewelry! There are just too many restaurants to list, just go to any and you'll have a great meal!"

This area has become a hip, trendy district and attracts mobs of tourists, especially on Sundays when many streets are closed to vehicular traffic. Its offerings range from gorgeous buildings of historical and architectural importance to charming boutiques. I love to visit beautiful Place des Vosges, the oldest square in Paris, and often duck into Comptoir des Cotonniers for a look at casual (but not inexpensive) women's fashion. Good restaurants and cafes abound. Just check the outside menus to determine where you want to eat. My favorite for salads and sandwiches is Carette at Place des Vosges. And the best falafel I've had outside of Israel is at L'As du Falafel on rue des Rosiers. Many delis and cafes here specialize in kosher food. That's because Le Marais is a major center of the Paris Jewish community.Myriad museums beckon in Le Marais. I especially like Musee Carnavalet, which is free and focuses on the history of Paris. As an Art Nouveau enthusiast, I find this museum's reconstructed shop of the jeweler Georges Fouquet -- decorated by Alphonse Mucha - to be absolutely spectacular. Musee National Picasso in an elegant 17th-century townhouse has been closed for years for renovation but is expected to finally reopen soon. I enjoyed the original so expect this update, which has more than doubled the public space, to be outstanding.I highly recommend checking out Le Marais to become familiar with this fascinating Paris neighborhood. Simply wandering and window shopping can be extremely rewarding here."

Paris is basically a walking city and there is something to see everyplace you walk. I found that by the end of the day I was at least 3 miles from my hotel in the Marais district and it was so nice to jump on a subway and be back to my room in 10 minutes. There are plenty of little cafes where you can get a crepe or Panini to go right around the corner. There is a man that roasts chickens on a rotisserie and the juices fall to the bottom where he has little white potatoes. What a great idea and he only charges a few dollars for enough food for a meal. This part of Paris has become a very trendy place to be since I started going there 15 years ago"

Terrific place to walk around as there are lots of interesting shops and food places. From American Apparel to a quirky little bookstore/art gallery, it's a fun place to wander around (without the imposing, dark-suited security guards that we experienced in most other areas in and around Paris when we browsed in the shops and boutiques). We felt safe and simply enjoyed the overall experience of the look of the streets and buildings and cool vibe. We made a reservation to have crepes for dinner at Breizh Cafe, which capped off our trip to this area (but that's a different review!). Our favorite chocolatier and dessert place, Jacques Genin, is less than a 10 minute walk away, but we had already made our trip there the previous day. Definitely a great walkable area to take mature teens/young adults, for its friendly shopping and fun exploration. Fairly easy to get here by metro (we travelled here from the Latin Quarter). If I were ever to return to Paris (which is not likely - again, that's another review!), I would definitely return to visit this area again."

The Marais is one of the most beautiful parts of Paris \u2013 and one of the only areas that preserved the narrow streets and architectural styles of Medieval and Renaissance Paris. Historically, it was the Jewish quarter, and in modern times it still is\u2026 but it is also a funky, hip area for people to hang out in or to go antique-ing. A stroll in this neighborhood and you can find kosher butchers, trendy clothing boutiques, breathtaking architecture, antique shops, and many shops with Jewish paraphernalia. Just be sure that you stop for lunch at the world famous falafel house called L'As du Falafel (located at 34 rue des Rosiers, closed Saturdays). Unfortunately, they do not have a website, but this is the place where celebrities come to get their falafel because it is so delicious.Two other great lunch options are Breizh Caf\u00e9 (109 rue Vieille du Temple, closed Mondays and Tuesdays) and Le Loir Dans la Theiere (3 rue des Rosiers, open every day).These are some things worth checking out in the Marais:The rue des Francs-Bourgeois, rue Vieille du Temple and rue des Archives are the three principle strolling streets for the shops, cafes and general ambiance. Many of the shops there will be open on Sundays. While on the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, make sure to pop your heads into the courtyard of the Carnavalet Museum to check out its wonderful gardens, beautiful this time of year! The buildings are in fact two adjacent Renaissance mansions.Place des Vosges- Take a stroll at Place des Vosges (metro: St. Paul or Bastille, lines 1, 5, and 8). This beautiful square is the oldest square in Paris and was inaugurated in 1612 under the name Place Royale. In 1800, it changed its name to honor the administrative department called Vosges (located in the north-eastern France) because they were the first department to pay their taxes. Napoleon himself referred to Place des Vosges as the \u2018jewel of Paris\u2019, the most beautiful place in the whole city.Victor Hugo's House- A notable inhabitant of number 6 Place des Vosges was the author and poet Victor Hugo. Hugo lived here from 1832- 1848, after he completed the Hunchback of Notre Dame. His former home is now a museum dedicated to him, which features an impressive collection of his drawings and paintings. Open from 10am-5:40pm. To see the permanent collection is free, for temporary exhibits the price is 7.70 euros. It is closed on Mondays.While you\u2019re over there, make sure you stop at 4 rue du Pas de la Mule \u2013 there is a gem of an artisan chocolate shop there called Josephine Vannier. The creations are unique \u2013 chocolate masks, mini pianos, replicas of vintage ads\u2026 (Closed Monday)Hotel de Sens \u2013 this majestic Medieval building is now an art library. It was built between 1475 and 1519. Stop for a moment to admire the elegant formal gardens \u2013 grab a bench in the sun for a bit of relaxation time! And look on the outside wall of the third floor for the cannonball lodged there in 1830. 1 rue Figuier 75004Village St. Paul \u2013 nestled between rue des Jardins St-Paul and rue Saint-Paul just south of rue Charlemagne is Village St Paul, an incredible antique, art, and artisan market! The interconnected courtyards allow you to enter along any of the streets mentioned above. This is really a unique place to go \u2013 many Parisians don\u2019t even know about it! Open every day.Hotel de Sully \u2013 walk through the main courtyard to see the Greek-inspired statues in this beautiful mansion, built between 1625 and 1630. 62 rue Saint-Antoine.Carnavalet Museum- The Paris history museum has artifacts on display that chart the history of Paris from Gallo-Roman times to present day. Some of France's most important documents, paintings, and other objects from the French Revolution are housed here. 23 rue de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 75003.Open from 10am-6pm Tuesday-Sunday (Closed Mondays). To see the permanent collection is free.See the link for more details http://en.parisinfo.com/museum-monuments/232/musee-carnavalet-musee-de-l-histoire-de-paris?1The Museum of Jewish Art and History- This museum showcases important Jewish art, artifacts and culture, much of which was destroyed during World War II. This museum pays tribute to the rich history of Jewish people in Europe and in particular France. It is open from 11am-6pm and the cost is 6.80 euros per person (audioguide included in price). Located in the Hotel de Saint-Aignan, 71 rue du Temple (this is not a hotel, it\u2019s a \u2018hotel particulier\u2019 which is basically an inner-city mansion). Learn more here: http://www.mahj.org/en/index.phpLa Memorial de la SHOAH- This is a research center dedicated to WWII. It is open from 10am- 5pm (Closed Saturdays), is free of charge and features documentation and photographs of significant value. Also has temporary exhibits on Jewish writers, artists, and others who have or are doing great things for society. If you have any Jewish family that were in Europe during WWII, you can look them up - For more details, see here: http://www.memorialdelashoah.org/getHomeAction.do?langage=en17, rue Geoffroy-l'AsnierThe oldest food market in Paris, March\u00e9 des Enfants Rouges, is also in the Marais (the northern part). If you have time, you should make the visit (even if it is all covered in scaffolding right now)! If you do decide that you want to take a look, just keep in mind it is best not to go between 1-4pm during the week, as some of the stands will be closed for lunch. It is closed on Mondays. Follow the arrow along rue des Archives on the map until reaching rue de Bretagne. Rue de Bretagne turns into rue Froissart further east, which you can see on the map. Make a right on rue de Bretagne and after about a block and a half you will see the entrances to the market on the right."

Wonderful parks, small old streets with an \"Old Paris\" feel (a feeling destroyed in the rest of the city during the Hausmann and subsequent renovations), lots of small cafes and some wonderful gourmet restaurants, good shopping (especially men's fashion). It is the heart of the city's old Jewish and gay communities, too. Easily accessible by several metro stops."

There's so much going for this neighbourhood but I can see it's at risk of becoming too gentrified and probably for most Parisians that ship has already sailed. If you like trendy boutiques and hip galleries you will be in heaven. For the wandering curious tourist armed with camera (i.e. me) there are lots of winding old streets and quite quintessential looking restaurants/bistros (like Chez Julien for example).So despite this being a hot spot for Paris Fashion Week and being home to Karl Lagerfeld's boutique, there's still lots of character and some insight can be gleaned into how the place must have been 50-100 years ago if you study the architecture. High points are Rue des Rosiers but it can get quite crowded with tourists around Murciano, the kosher jewish bakery. Others include the beautiful and aristocratic Place de Vosges, the vibrant gay community and of course the orthodox jewish community going about their daily business.Compared to the usual charmless tourist guide book recommended places like Montmartre and seedy Pigalle, this really is a must see district."

Problem is, it is no longer the Marais I knew and fell in love with. It was once a little \"gritty\" shall we say. Full of quirky little shops, lovely local caf\u00e9s and restaurants. The streets were a little unloved so less touristy. Now it all seems a little antiseptic and corporate. The quirky shops are largely gone, and the lovely Jewish shops on Rue de Rosier are disappearing, to be replaced by yet more overpriced \"boutiques\". As if we need any more!!. Everything changes, as it should, but it is sad when these change are not for the better. Le Marais was once the place to see old Paris. It is becoming another area of chichi high street shops. To see bits of old Paris, look at the lovely Place des Vosges, the back streets of Pigalle, the working market on Rue Mouffetard, and some of the non tourist streets around Montmartre. Yes, honestly, there are secret places there. Don't rely on me to tell you. Look around, there are great treasures to be seen and beautiful quiet spots to be found. When you find them, do as I do and keep them secret, then they are always \"yours\"."

I won\u2019t go into the regular stuff you can read in any of the Guide books. Some of my thoughts are:The Marias is still growing at a fast pace. Many new stores and restaurants opening all the time. And not just on the main streets. I suggest you go down the smaller side streets and you will find many interesting places. It is an exciting area of Paris. Most of Paris stays the same and that is alright because it is so great. Not the Marais, it is changing every week. The great old buildings and they are old are still there on the small crowed streets but the ground floors are being made into commercial clothing and retail stores of all kinds. I walked all the streets, I was in Paris for 3 weeks. A joy to just walk around the Marais.I like to get a sandwich on St. Antoine and walk over to Place Vosges and sit in this very lovely park and watch all the people and have lunch. A very nice and peaceful place. I\u2019m not that much into history but I suggest you read about this place. I visit here every week.Twice this trip I would go out the north side of the park and to the right and up the next street to Caf\u00e9 Januo. A wonderful small Caf\u00e9 that never disappoints. I get there around Noon to beat the Paris crowd that eats around 1pm. And it will be crowded.I love the Marais area. I always stay at the Hotel du 7th Art on St Paul, a small affordable place that is a bit away from the noise of the Marais. The Marais is almost always crowed but on weekends it is Party time. Lots and lot of people, Parisians and tourists all together and having a good time.From almost any place in Paris, just take the Metro Line 1 to St, Paul and your there.A wonderful place to visit."

Some things cost a fortune and then suddenly you will find the perfect gift to take home to a loved one for next to nothing. The roads are small and winding and even after visiting the Marais many many times I always get lost. There is the Jewish quarter where the cheese cakes and strudels are to die for. The history of the area is somewhat disturbing but interesting as stories of the past always are. I always have a little sadness whilst moving around and reading how many people were deported from this building or that. The gay community are well represented in the Marais which is always fun, beautiful people strutting around, plenty of coffee shops, restaurants and bars where all are welcome."

The tour was about 2 hours and really gave us a sense of the neighborhood's roots and history--fascinating stuff.The area is filled with cute shops and nice cafes. I was particularly impressed with the paper stores along Rue de Pont Louis Philippe--Papier+ and Melodies graphiques were standouts for their gorgeous cards and colorful papers."

This area is full of character, and includes some good cheap restaurants, lovely place/squares, chocolatiers etc. Just a few hundred meters away was the Place de La Bastille, where there is a weekend market. To the North is the wonderful Place des Voges, or to the North West, the Pletzl area, full of Jewish eateries. If you are a walker, it is possible to visit St Germain and/or Notre Dame fairly easily. Along the Rue Rivoli, even the Louvre is reachable, past the Hotel de Ville. Further afield, the Champs Elysee can be reached from the St Paul Metro station."

You'll see nannies out with their little charges, busy business people grabbing a quick espresso before work, people buying their baguette for the day, conversations going on. Very easy access to the Metro. My stop was St. Paul. There's the Place des Voges as well as Victor Hugo's house within walking distance. You might see some amateur artists at work. If you're a fan, you have to visit his house. There's also the Shoah Memorial, a museum dedicated to French jews. Sobering and heart breaking yet inspiring when you see the section devoted to the resistance and those who helped the Jews escape. Sit outside at a cafe. Walk and wander. You'll love it."

It still features many art galleries, the Pompidou and Picasso Museums are there (the Picasso is still closed for renovation) and many small antique shops.

But once we found an affordable boutique hotel there (Ecole Centrale Hotel), it was a natural thing to spend a day exploring the district, and we were instantly in love!Rue St. Antoine, the Village St. Paul, Place des Vosges, Rue des Francs Bourgeois, the cafes, Musee Carnavalet, and on and on. Then on the northern side of the district - our hotel was right near the intriguing Musee des Arts et Metiers, and we had wonderful breakfasts at the Cafe of the same name, and we walked down the Rue Turbigo with its many restaurants as well.If we ever completely lost our minds and decided we wanted to live in Paris, we would without question want to live in the Marais. Is it affordable to live there? Probably not - although the northern part (the 3rd arrondissement) is probably more residential and affordable than the southern part (the 4th) with all its medieval village feeling and so forth."

It is definately a bigger and more crowded area than St Germain but the mid-range shops, departmental stores and range of cusine makes Le Marais a more conducive place to stay and visit. You can easily spend a day just walking around and window shop at Marais, St Germain is a smaller area, more personable with cosy cafes and restaurants and upmaket shopping. If I come back to Paris someday, I will want to try staying at Le Marais Area."

When king Louis XIV moved his court to Versailles in the latter part of the century, the courtiers had to follow and some of their beautiful 'hotel particuliers' (town mansions) fell into disrepair. The houses were taken over by less well-off people and the area became such that there was talk of destroying and modernizing some parts. The minister for culture Andre Malraux saved the Marais in the 1960s, pointing out what heritage it contained and it was restored. Narrow streets of medieval tracing and proportions alternate with beautiful facades. See, if you only have limited time, the lovely Place des Vosges with the pink brick and stone facade, and the Musee Picasso housed in one of the former mansions. Good for a leisurely wander taking in the meandering streets"

            "review": "From swamp to quintessential Paris neighborhood. Yes, the word 'marais' in French means 'swamp', because that's what used to be on this spot a few hundred years ago. But then the bigwigs moved in, built a few grand h\u00f4tels (big, BIG mansions), and the place filled up with shops and restaurants. Then it went into a long decline. But it was still home to a great deal of the Jewish population in Paris ... until the Nazis rolled into the city and carted every Jew off to the concentration camps. Awful stuff. But many Jews returned, and the neighborhood started to come back to life. Starting in the late 20th century, though, the Marais became the gay neighborhood, and we all know what happens after that - massive gentrification. The Marais is where you come to get a feel for old Paris, with medieval-like tight streets, winding this way and that; where everyone walks or sits in caf\u00e9s; where you wind up trying to select which wonderful restaurant to have dinner at on any particular evening. The hotels in this neighborhood have typically small rooms, but with wooden rafters, French doors and beautiful appointments, they tend to be very, very homey. Some newer hotels, like the Jules et Jim, are modernism personified and perhaps more fun for the younger crowd. There's something here for every sensibility, and the neighborhood definitely caters to the more modern trends; there's a reason why they built the Pompidou Center in the Marais. Yet the old world exists in the craft of the restauranteurs (suggested: Le Bouledogue), the authentic nature of the patisseries (e.g. Hur\u00e9 and Pain de Sucre on Rue Rambuteau) and the crafts, from places where you can have your own belt made, to leather bags that are made by hand. It's been my favorite neighborhood in Paris for 25 years, and it's where I rent an apartment when I come to town, to better enjoy being a part of the ebb and flow of the Marais."

Walking through the Marais really made me appreciate how over-commercialized the US is.

It is not so touristy as some other areas in Paris (considering we were there in July), yet still has some wonderful tourist attractions such as the Musee Carnavelet, and Victor Hugo's house.

Withing walking distance of a few major sites.Be in a very historic area that has not been completely gentrified. Find a place to stay that won't break the budget. The above is what we found in the Marias. Our street had 2 bakeries, a couple of small cafes, one restaurant that was beyond fabulous, a few ethnic eateries that were out of this world, fruit stand, small grocery store, a couple of wine shops, a meat shop, a fish shop and a place to stay that was very reasonable (small, yes but it was a clean apartment with a kitchen, washer 1 bedroom, large bathroom, looking into a tiny courtyard and best of all...the quietest place I have ever slept).I will always stay in this area when visiting Paris in the future."

During the 1st week of Feb 2014, my wife and I spent a week in a very well appointed small apartment at Rue Amelot, 100 meters from the St. Sebastian Froissart Metro station on Line 8. This was our 2nd sojourn in the Marais, although whenever we visit Paris there is always something interesting to bring us back for a day's walking around the place It is, in fact, a great place for walking. Where we were gave us access to Place Bastille, Place des Vosges, Hotel de Ville, and Pompidou Center in 20 -40 minutes. Although it is jammed with cafes, bars, brasseries, bistrots and restaurants, we do not find the food especially good in this part of town. Indeed, on this visit, it wasn't particularly good anywhere in Paris, and my wife and I came down with GI episodes on two consecutive days that wiped out 48 hours from our very limited schedule. There are some very upmarket traiteurs around with very gourmet take-out food, but as with restos, Paris prices are ridiculously high and well above those of the South. The whole of the Marais is well served by Metro and bus circuits, but walking is the way to get around, weather and energy permiting. Among the places not to be missed are the Musee Picasso ( temporarily closed), Carnevalet,, Hotel de Sully, The Jewish quarter is around the Rue Vieille du Temple and Rue Rosiers, containing lots of delicatessen shops, the Museum of Jewish Art and History, and the Memorial to the Shoah. Rue des Francs-Bourgeois and Rue Sevigne contain some very expensive fashion and perfume shops, and nearby is the Hotel Lamoignon, a handsome 16th Cent, building now serving as the Historical Library of the City of Paris..Place des Vosges hosts a large number of fascinating art shops, as well as the Musee Victor Hugo and L'Ambroisie, an unaffordable 3-star Michelin restaurant, but since the departure of Fauchon there is no decent food shop close by. The Village of St Paul is quite fascinating, and quite rich in ecclesiastical buildings, notably Eglise St Paul-St Louis. Not far away is the Hotel de Sens and the Lycee Charlemagne, both close to Metro Pont-Marie (Line 7). The entire area is spotless, well decorated with shrubs and flowers, and probably the safest in the city."

Outside a queue forms for the Jewish bakery and a tr\u00e8s chic 20 something in high heels leads a Llama past.Nearby at La Bastille we arrive just as thousands and thousands of cheering Parisians welcome the newly elected President for a speech.

In the Marais, a great treasure is La Place des Vosges, a huge (ie. huge) square of identical town houses bult in the Renaissance, (the first public square in Europe), built by the France's hero-king, Henri IV. (The houses now sell for more than $1,000,000 US.) At the centre of La Place des Vosges is a large lawn and garden, fountains, shade trees. One can stroll around the entire Place under its shaded arcade; the ground floor of the houses has been given over to antique shops, book shops, art shops, and a few caf\u00e9s; one of the houses is the home of Victor Hugo where he wrote Les Mis\u00e9rables: it is a museum, open to the public."

We recently visited Paris and stayed a few nights in Le Marais district, a quieter and less touristy area of the city and very much enjoyed this area of the city.  Le Marais covers a fairly large area north of the Seine River. Important attractions in this area include the historic Musee Carnavalet and Musee Cognagy-Jay as well as Musee des Arts et Metiers and Musee Picasso for art lovers. These museums as well as other historical buildings and squares in Le Marais help make up probably a couple days worth of attractions to see in this part of the city. Other historic and interesting places to visit include the elaborate Hotel Villa, Opera National de Paris Bastille, the symmetric and lovely Place Des Vosges as well as the Bastille monument called Colonne de Juilet. Several other historic manor houses and hotels and squares make up Le Marais notable attractions. In Le Marais, you can also find many small art galleries, quaint shops, restaurants, cafes and bars. We enjoyed Creperie Suzette on Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, near Musee Cognacy-Jay. We also had a delicious street-side crepe just outside the farmers market at Bastille Square. Also, the best dinner we had during our last trip to Paris was in Le Marais at a lovely restaurant called Qui Plume la Lune on Rue Amelot.Overall, we very much enjoyed Le Marais district and would be happy to stay in this area of Paris again. This area of the city is well worth at least a day to explore and to enjoy the fine collection of museums, historic buildings, monuments and public spaces that can be enjoyed here."

Yes the Paris highlights are magnificent but areas such as Le Marais are beguiling, inviting and always interesting. Don't miss this area even only as a relief to the manic crowds at the major sites. As an added advantage, it is not polluted by the ever present groups of apparently immigrant street kids who only see tourists as an opportunity for pickpocketing or some other swindle"

There are art galleries in the covered walkway of the Place des Vosges and an antiquarian flea market in Rue St. Paul. The place is not lacking in variety or picturesque spots.

Make sure you don't miss the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet (history of Paris) and the Place des Vosges, where you can visit Victor Hugo's house as well."

Also visited the large muse of Jewish history and the Shoah memorial. Had the well known \"best\" falafel on yelp and other kosher treats. Took a free walking tour which gave a nice overall view of the area. Enjoyed the art galleries around the Place de Vodges. Picasso museum is stil under renovation so closed and Victor Hugo house closed on Monday. Windy streets were confusing to navigate but charming if you don't care where you end up!"

We have visited the Marais at least 8 times in the last 14 years, but with the assistance of a knowledgeable guide your understanding and appreciation of what is there and what once was there takes on a new dimension. Chantal was able to get us inside 3 of the small synagogues to view the unusual arrangements of both Sephardic and Ashkenazi bimahs. We learned about the migration to Paris of Jews from across Europe and North Africa as well."

We stayed in an apartment in the Rue Rambuteau some years back and absolutely loved it so much so that we wanted to do it again as there are so many boutiques and small specialty shops selling absolutely everything around that area, just up from the Pompidou Centre . There was so much character and personality and interest there. This time we thought we had again booked an apartment in the Marais (4e) but it turned out to be the 3e in the Rue Portefoin, just off Rue du Temple which seems to be a street almost totally devoted to shops selling wholesale Chinese made costume jewellery with hardly a food shop in sight and only a couple of restaurants - just jewellery. Also there are many people sleeping on the streets including an entire family of 5 people. Although the apartment here is quite nice I would never stay in this area again so my advice would be to be very particular about which postcode you stay in. The 4e is great, the 3e not so. Check the map of Paris before booking. I wish someone had given me this advice before I booked."

Nothing could be further from the truth. I learned a little French before we went and it really helped a lot. The business and cafe personel were helpful and anxious to serve. Its really important to say Bonjour to the owners when you enter their stores, that is a huge courtesy, and the restaurant staff work there as their livelihood, its not a job to get them through school. Be respectful. The Marais appeared to be washed down at night, hence, its very clean and well maintained. Most places speak some English. Our favorite thing to do was find a nice outdoor table, drink wine, and people watch. The cafe staff will not rush you or ask you to leave so they can have your table (imagine that). We will definately go back. Apartment renting was wonderful as long as you remember there is no consierge to answer your questions or book reservations. We couldn't figure out how to turn on the tv and a couple of the kitchen appliances were hard to figure out. The apartment owner spoke no English, therefore, communication was not the best. We felt like that was all part of the experience and how can you be disappointed .... you're in Paris!"

We started at the Place de Voges which we last visited over 40 years ago. It had changed completely. It was beautifully maintained, child friendly and inviting. We had a lovely stay but had difficulty finding a Kosher restaurant because it was difficult finding Rue de Rosiers. However when we did we had a wonderful meal at an Israeli themed restaurant. By the way there are a few museums in the area. Unfortunately one of them, the Picasso Museums was closed for renovations. In sum the Marais is worth the adventure just bring a better map than we had."

A glance at some of the beautiful buildings and houses indicates the wealthy status of the former residents. After the revolution, much of the area was abandoned by the rich, and poor bohemian types moved in. The area was considered so squalid at this point it was nearly destroyed by city officials who wanted to modernize Paris. You should keep in mind that before Napoleon showed up the Marais is what most of Paris looked like, a labyrinth of cobblestone alleys. The rest of Paris was razed by Napoleon and Haussman who wanted to build huge avenues and gigantic squares such as the Place Concorde. These are now the glory of Paris, but they were originally conceived so that armies and artillery could be moved around the city to keep the poor in check and defeat invaders. On a more metaphysical level, the purpose of such broad space is to make the citizen feel small and powerless when faced with the giant civic machine of government, or an obedient army. In the Marais we are privy to the small and approachable Paris of the past, the place to wander in maddening circles and never find your way, the place to hole up and read Sartre or Camus in a caf\u00e9 window or stare at that Parisian beauty with her slim cigarette and wild scarf. The Marais is also the most famous Jewish quarter in Paris and in much of Europe, still maintaining strong traditions."

Also we were drawn to the cosmopolitan nature of the area and the interesting Jewish section.We were not disappointed. It was a brilliant location. We rented an apartment through Airbnb that was on the Rue des Archives just up from the Rue de Rivoli with a great department store (BHV) opposite and 10 cafes/restaurants within 50 metres. Easy walking to Notre Dame/Left Bank/Place des Vosges.The only drawback was the night noise. We were on the 4th floor and directly above what would have to be the nosiest bar in Paris. We were there in the heatwave of late July and with no air-conditioning had to leave the windows open. Need I say more. Still at least we were able to pop across the road to the department store to buy a fan - which we left in the apartment.Apart from that we loved having a week in Le Marais."

Now it is a fabulous, hip area with lovely restaurants, bars, boutiques and a beautiful park."

The shopping is excellent, and the shops are open on Sundays, unlike much of Paris. This area is slightly bohemian, but it has gotten popular and is often rammed with tourists. Place de Vosges is nice for its cafes surrounding a nice green square, but again, this area is super busy with tourists. Walking down the streets, there isn't enough room on the sidewalks and you are constantly dodging the cars that are passing by. Overall, I would recommend a visit if you have time and want to do some shopping, but this is not the quiet bohemian area that it used to be. Think Soho in NYC about 10-15 years ago: it used to be alive with artists but now has lots of high end stores and is crowded with tourists"

We took two tours of the Maris - one was a food tour organized by La Cuisine Paris (English Speaking), and the other was a \"volunteer\" tour that I learned about from a brochure I got at a spot on the bank of Seine. Both were great! The food tour \"Bellies on Foot\" took us all around the Marais to the bakeries, delis and other food specialty shops. The guide explained a lot about the shops and the foods and she purchased something at each stop and at the end of the tour we sat down in quiet room at La Cuisine's cooking school and tasted all the wonderful foods over a delicious bottle of wine.The \"volunteer\" tour was billed as local Parisians showing you the city (in English). Our guide, Justine, was fantastic. The tour is free, and the guides do them for tips - 5 or 10 euro per person is what I would suggest depending on how pleased you are with the tour.I also walked the Marais on my own in-between these two tours. I loved the area, and saw something different each time. Although I enjoyed wondering on my own, if you don't have that much time in your schedule I would definitely recommend taking a walking tour and not wandering on your own. There is so much that a guide can explain about the neighborhood that will make your time there much more meaningful and memorable."

There are also many vintage shops and less exalted second hand clothes shops. After a long walk we decided to have lunch rue des Rosiers and we sat at the terrace of a tiny falafel restaurant instead of having a take-away like we did once (in another restaurant). This was a mistake and a major disappointment. We wanted to share a plate because I was not very hungry and have two drinks but we were informed that we had to order two main dishes, so we took two falafel \"on a plate\". We were brought two plates of something which were not falafels but small boulettes of what must be left when the bigger falafels are shaped, sinking in a sort of sickening hommous sauce without any garnish at all, even not one salad leaf. For this we paid twenty six euros which I found a rip off. No wonder that there were only tourists sitting there. The big, good, cheap restaurant of my youth where students used to go: Jo Goldenberg, closed down and is now another boring clothes shop. For the old Parisian, le Marais is just a disappointment, going the same way as le BHV. They say that you have to live with your time so I prefer to leave the place to the new comers and keep my nice memories of a place which disappeared now to start to look like an attraction at Disneyland."

There are good vintage \"kilo\" shops where you pay by the kilo of the clothes you buy and other expensive clothing shops like fred perry, sandro, the kooples. There was an amazing bookstore i visited but I cant remember the name - literature fills the ground floor when you enter and then a spiral staircase takes you beneath the street into two small rooms filled with coffee table books on everything - sex, art, death, spiritualism, fashion, history, culture.

Whether you are a jaded parisian or a fresh tourist spending hardly the first week of your life in our beautiful capital, you're not stranded on your sofa (appartment or hotel room one's) on Sunday. Get to the Marais, enjoy all that the place has to offer from International Fashion store to Kosher retaurants and the best EggPlants Caviar you'll ever taste in your life at Sasha Finjkelstein store rue des rosiers. You love design: plenty to shop around. You want to feel in Historcal Paris ? walk to nearby Place des Vosges. Want to feel a more american vibe ? Have a hamburger at Schwartzs rue des Ecouffes. Want to feel the jewish vibe of the area ? Sasha Finjkelstein of course but also the Gefilte fish restaurant rue des Ecouffes as well."

But it was still an interesting area to walk around - very necessary as it has a large area with no metro stations. A good route through the Marais is to start at the Seine and walk up Rue Vieille du Temple, diverting down Rue des Rosiers, where Hannas does great falafels with a much shorter queue than the place further East."

It was there that I was able to purchase a scarf that was hand made by a French textile artisan by the name of Muriel Geoffrey. She was as charming as her little shop and spent a great deal of time having me try on many different colors and styles. As one would imagine, they were not cheap. However, I felt it really important to return with a true Paris treasure. The shop consists of five women who create works of art by using their hands and their imaginations. They don't take American Express, so bring euros or debit/cc."

Notice the delicate brickwork,the small variation to the mansions, the exquisite park with its sculptures and tended gardens and the children playing. Did you know,that Les Miserables, was written at number6,where Victor Hugo lived. Its worthwhile to see what the area was like at the hight of its grandeur by visiting the Carnavalet Museum which is filled with the history of paris.  Grab a coffee and enter rue Thorigny for the Picasso museum. If you are interested in the Jewish Quarter just stroll up Rue de Rosiers. This was once the largest enclave of jewish community in Europe. Today, the street is packed with delis,bakeries.old hamams and eateries especially fallafel joints. Yummmmm. The Rue St.Antoine in the center is marvelous with the square of St.Catherine being my favorite at night for its amazing atmosphere in this small square ringed by old apartments and giant trees with soft light filtering down through the leaves and the glow of street lamps. There are nice bars and restaurants strung around the perimeter of the square to sit,eat and sip a glass of wine. The Marais is also known for its numerous art galleries and design shops,a bit like Soho in Manhattan. The high end art in some cases is an enormous waste of beautiful space,in others,very satisfying art. If you are interested more in early 20 th century artists,go to Rue de Seine in St.Germain for a better spot to look. You have by now a raging thirst.....so head to La Cave a Bulles for a huge choice in artisan beers. Enjoy the small crooked medieval lanes are alive with bars,eateries,because this is the closest you can get to medieval Paris which is packed with pre- revolutionary buildings and streets left intact. This is my favorite historic district in paris. As you amble further,you notice the influence that the chinese community have contributed on Rue du Temple and Place de la Republic. Other features of the neighborhood include the Musee Picasso,musee carnavalet and the brilliant Musee d'Art et d'histoire du Judaisme. You are now walking in the shoes of famous personalities like,Robespierre,Hugo,Galliano and Dominique- Strauss-Kahn For a good nosh try Chez Marianne,Pitchi poi and the Jewish bakery for incredible pastry.And remember not to miss out on a quiet read at the City of Paris History Library. This is the area where walking with a copy of Sartre and Camus is considered tres cool"

Places of interest would include the homes of Victor Hugo and the famous Cardinal Richelieu, leading character in The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas and founder of the Academie Fran\u00e7aise. Richelieu is also said to be the world\u2019s first Prime Minister. Adjacent to cobbled streets with bohemian boutiques and cafes, this part of Le Marais provides a wide sociological spectrum of Paris from the 14th to the 20th century. Look out for the caf\u00e9 Les Philosophes, meeting place for Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Gustav Flaubert and other members of the existentialist movement.

We rented through Haven in Paris, which was a fabulous experience. The Place des Vosges is beautiful, and the area has many nice shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. Metro stop \" Bastille\" was the one we used. The Victor Hugo house museum and the Musee Carnavalet are within a few blocks of each other, both are free, and both were very interesting and worth seeing. It wasn't too far of a walk to Pere Lachaise cemetery, either. We loved all the unique shops, the cafes and restaurants in the Marais were busy but friendly and relaxing. We always felt safe and comfortable in this area, and would not hesitate to stay here again. Les Petite Marches was a favorite neighborhood restaurant that we went to a few times!"

SO, we decided to give the Marais a try, It was great. the little streets have all kind of little independant stores and beautiful little parks. It can be crazy- Sundays- but that adds to the fun. I didn't rate it 5 stars as we found that it wasnt' as easy to get early morning pastries ( my husband likes to go out and bring back an assortment to have with coffee) and since we like to walk everywhere, it was just a little farther from the centre with all of the attractions we like- Tulleries, Luxembourg gardens, seeing the Eiffel tower at night. Having said that, we would stay there again. With some research there is good restaurants in this area, and the Bastille market is a good one,not too far of a walk."

It is now trendy and chic but wander and find the old Marais of the small crooked lanes that was Paris and see its Jewish history and the Museum of Jewish Art and History (71, rue de Temple). The Place de Voges, is a beautifully historic square and not to be missed since it was built by Henry IV in the early 1600s. Victor Hugo lived at # 6 while he wrote Les Miserables. If you want to know more about the history of Paris then the Carnavalet Museum (23 rue de Sevigne) is where you must go and it is free. The Picasso Museum is at # 5 Rue Thorigny but check since it seems to be under a never ending renovation. The Marais is between the Place de la Bastille and the Pompidou Centre so it is a good place to spend more than a day to get a feel for Paris now and the past."

That's what the word means, anyway, but in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, when anybody who was anybody lived here, it was already a built-up and very urban area.To try to say anything about the Marais is like trying to say something about Old Regime Paris: you just don't know where to begin.So let's start with the layout of the streets. They are narrow, short, and tend to curve and change direction. Napoleon III and Haussmann never got around to redesigning the streets here for the Twenty-Eighth Century. If you want to imagine the circumstances under which Henri IV was murdered, just look around you.There are plenty of museums, almost-museums and sort-of museums here. One of the highlights is the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet, which was the H\u00f4tel Carnavalet in the bad old days. In other words, the place where Mme de Sevign\u00e9 lived and wrote most of her letters. If you wander around here you can understand how she could live here without meeting her boarders - her daughter or others - except when she wanted to; the lady who was always writing about her near-bankruptcy actually lived in a palace. There's supposed to be a portrait of her here which I don't remember seeing, but I do remember a *Diana Bathing* by Boucher which is not as slick as the famous one in the Louvre, and therefore much better.There is a synagogue on the rue Pav\u00e9e which was designed by Hector Guimard of Metro-entrance fame; he was married to a Jewish woman, at least according to French law. Some of the times I was there there was a note tacked up saying that it was open only for prayer, not tourism, but sometimes the sign wasn't there.Speaking of which, if you need strictly kosher restaurants, this part of the Marais has the only real concentration of them in all of France; a French Jew whom I asked about this agrees with me. You can also find strictly kosher groceries here; our main source was Epices D\u00e9lices, also on rue Pav\u00e9e."

Make sure you check this funky little strip out on a weekday or Saturday, and then on a Sunday, head back, and see what it's like when it's a 'rue pi\u00e9ton' (walking street) - all traffic is blocked off, and the food stalls come out on to the street and sell. The smell alone is worth it!"

There is a strong connection to the Jewish community with the Museum of Jewish on Rue du Temple and adjoining the Park dedicated to Anne Frank.Strolling down rue de Bretagne you can enjoy the pretty Square du Temple with it's flowers pond and children's playground. A bit further along the Marche' des Enfantes Rouges is a market offering all sorts of fresh produce.The Place des Vosges was a favourite of ours, surrounded by a Colonnaded walkway it is a place of art galleries and cafes and also housing Victor Hugo's apartment.We had a 10 day stay here and feel we barely scratched the surface of this amazing place."

Even if you cant afford it, or dont want to be bothered with cleaning silver, it is beautiful to ogle at - simply as works of art.

And that is saying a lot, because I adore the entire city. Like the Latin Quarter and the Opera Quarter, the Marais teems with life. It's chic but gritty, if that's possible. It crammed with everything most busy quarters offer: A variety of caf\u00e9s and restaurants, boutiques and shoe stores, patisseries and cheese mongers, and hidden corners begging to be explored. Probably my favorite area is the one near the church of St. Paul-St. Louis because it contains everything needed to make a visit to Paris complete and satisfying, including some very modern and well-priced hotels. Sandwiched between the Bastille and the church, the busy stretch of Rue St Antoine is perfect for people watching. The Place de Vosge, Musee Carnavalet, and the Village St. Paul are favorite places to visit. We once saw a traditional chimney sweep in this neighborhood, and we've met delightful Americans and Canadians at the Red Wheelbarrow book store on Rue St. Paul. This neighborhood is so complete that once, when two visits to Paris bookended a trip to the South of France, we never left! We spent three entire days in the Marais.In my book, the Marais joins the Latin Quarter and Boulevard St. Germaine as three areas you should visit if your Paris trip is a short one."

Le Marais is an old, historic part of Paris. You must see the Place des Vosges and some of the small museums there, as well. Le Marais is also great for just strolling and people-watching."

It is worth walking randomnly to find some hidden statues or green parks. I suggest going to Metro Bastille, look around the 'La Roquette' street and its infamous \"rue de Lappe' and then walk though the Marais until you reach Beaubourg. It is a beautiful walk by a sunny day."

Finally beyond the Centre Pompidou I found a gem, Le Marais. An area where I finally felt some Parisian charm and flair - artful graffiti on the walls, charming little bistros with dishes which illustrate invention and flair, independent florists and artisan bakers. After the tourist haven of Les Halles, the area oozes charm and vibrancy. I was drawn into the area to visit the Le Poil\u00e2ne bakery, which is actually superb. The bread is fantastic and the shop was not too busy when we got there late in the afternoon on the Saturday. I loved the area so much that I came back the next day to try the bistros and went to Le Bar Bouille - the food is great and the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is to die for (honestly). Anyway if you have a free afternoon in Paris, drag yourself away from that museum your guide book told you that you had to see and just go and try Le Marais.

You have the Jewish section and the Gay area and everyone melds in just nicely. I thoroughly enjoyed staying there, every morning I would walk through this gorgeous park, with a pond, ducks, children's play area, older Parisians playing chess and a group of older Asian women doing Ta Chi under the rotund. I even saw a group of men playing table tennis, all rugged up with there scarfs and winter coats whilst it was raining. A fascinating little park that I looked forward to walking through every day. The cafes and boulangeries were amazing and it also has the best falafel shop ever. Would definitely stay there again."

The contrast between the 3rd and the 16th arrondissements couldn't be greater, from the grand boulevards of wealth with ultra chic shops to narrow little streets and boutique shops, galleries and eateries.When moving back to Paris we chose the Marais over the plusher areas to the west for the same reason that makes this an essential part of your trip to the city - it's different.Once upon a time it was a Jewish enclave - you could even call it a ghetto - and if you look carefully there are still strong remnants of that past, from the moving plaques on walls commemorating how children were rounded up to be shipped to concentration camps by the French and the Germans in the Second World War to the names of the streets and the old Synagogue near St Paul's. You will also find a surviving population in their hasidic garb, with the felafel cafes being another feature from this tradition.But before that it was where the rich and privileged of the Second Estate had their hotels particulaires, and there are many of them that you can now visit - from the Swedish Institute through the stunning Hotel Sully and Place does Vosges.But what the Marais is now known for are the shops and galleries, from specialist shops selling exquisite choux to pop ups shops, hundreds of art galleries and thousands of boutiques. There are Jewish, Italian and Asian food areas.Sunday is a best time to visit since all the shops are open and the streets are shut and pedestrianised."

We arrived at about noon having walked over from the Luxumbourg Gardens with a stop at Notre Dame and there were many shops and restaurants open. The tourists and locals seemed hip - the area was a combination of la Vielle Ville in Geneve and So Ho combined. Cobble stone streets, narrow alleys, small buildings, with a combination of one of a kind boutiques mixed with venues with more of an international presence. SO MUCH better for shopping than the Champs au Lycee which I found to be a nightmare. We had a lovely lunch at a cafe'. Do not expect the best table without a reservation. Our crowded choice was able to offer us a table for 4 near the door but we were happy to have a fantastic meal. sorry i cannot remember the name of the place..."

Not sure how to describe my feelings at taking a walking tour (while listening to an audio Rick Steves tour) through this neighborhood. The area is a residential and business area that is being gentrified. It once housed the heart of Paris' Jewish population.It has become much more trendy. The main (walking/narrow) streets (in the neighborhood, not the main roadways, are from a time of the past. Then again, walk in almost any Paris arrondissment and you can say the same thing --you are walking in the past, yet you are in the 21st Century.While here though, we did visit the Jewish Museum and were very glad that it was open. We were impressed with the exhibits and background/information that they tried to pass on. For me it was a painful visit. There was a lot of anguish as it recounted the many instances of anti-semitism, discrimination and persecution. The exhibits also actively sought to provide information related to Jewish holidays, religious items and \"life\" as it existed in the context to items on display. In some instances, what was noted differed with my own knowledge, background and education. On an upbeat note, we had Falafal & other middle eastern cuisine at a famous local eatery (Falafal King Restaurant). Viewed the shops and stores from another life time and felt the pain of what was and what now is.Having said all of the above, I must point out that I was glad that we made it here. Glad that we did the walk and glad that we visited the Museum."

Was the highlight of our trip to Paris. Some reviewers complain about the number of tourists walking the Marais and there were certainly lots of them (us). However, it seems a little unfair for a tourist to complain about the number of tourists! Absolutely make a point of walking the Marais. Allow time for le shopping.

Useful walking streets either parallel the Seine or run from the Seine. If you turn the district, mentally, more or less into a grid, you can find your way quite easilyUseful walking streets away from the Seine in the Marais.rue du Templerue des Archivesrue Vieille-du Temple which becomes rue des Filles du Calvairerue de Turennethese all run from rue de Rivoli.(which becomes St Antoine going east) The other streets listed stop at rue de Rivoli but rue des Archives runs all the way to the Seine without a break. It goes behind the Hotel du Ville.Parallel streets from the Seine rue de Rivolirue Rambuteau becomes rue des Francs Bourgeois rue Reaumur becomes rue de BretagneUseful Metro stops or sites that I like to visit and that I think, define the limits of the neighbourhood are:Centre Pompidou (Metro : Rambuteau) and the Stravinsky Fountain whose separate pieces represent his ballet Rite of Spring, I think of as the heart of Marais. The most important main exhibits of the Pompidou are on the 5th floor. It is well worth checking what is on before you go because some special exhibits can be amazing. The Atelier Brancusi is a personal favourite and is free, just outside the Pompidou. From there you go west to St Eustache and les Halles (Metro les Halles) Then go north to rue Montorgueil (a nice walking shopping street) northern limit to rue Reamur note : St Denis is a nice walking /shopping street just north rue Reamur (Metro : Reamur/Sebastopol)Then going east along the northern limit of Marais along rue de Bretagne which is a nice walking / shopping st Marche des Enfants Rouge is on rue de Bretagne through such a small alley opening you can easily miss it. It is cute but I thought, overrated as rue Bretagne has such lovely food stores. Rue de Bretagne goes to Cirque d\u2019Hiver at Filles du Calvaire (Metro Filles du Calvaire) The Cirque d\u2019Hiver is well worth a visit.The Marais district goes south from there along rue du Temple where you arrive atMusee Picasso (being refurbished and not opening again til at least mid 2013) then back to rue de Rivoli. Now you have the limits of the Marais defined you can go and get lost in the rabbit warren and more easily find your way out if you find any of these grid like streets. Enjoy."

It\u2019s easy to get lost in a very good way along the many winding, tiny cobblestoned streets (often pedestrian since they are too narrow for cars). The Marais is one of the rare areas in Paris that preserved the narrow lanes and architectural styles of Medieval and Renaissance-era Paris because most of Paris was overhauled in the mid-19th century under Napoleon III and architect Baron Haussmann. The Marais, however, still suffering from the ghostly echoes of the Revolution (much of the bloodiest moments were in the Marais), was ignored in the overhaul. Therefore, the district stands out as very distinct in Paris. It has its own unique blend of eerie enchantment that is impossible to resist. As you enter the district from the Notre Dame area, stroll the Rue des Barres behind the St. Gervais et St. Pervais Church, and you\u2019ll instantly understand what I mean. There is a timelessness in the Marais, one that makes you wonder if a revolution is erupting down the street or if a noble\u2019s vast mounted entourage in medieval regalia might soon stomp you down.Tourist crowds are thinner in the Marais, but there are still plenty of museums and landmarks to visit\u2014chiefly being the Bastille Monument, Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis Cathedral, the Place des Vosages, Victor Hugo\u2019s residence, and the Carnavalet Museum. Also, there are many charming, traditional tiny cafes and a lot of specialty shops, especially on the cobblestoned Rue des Rosiers in the heart of the Jewish quarter of the district. Still, the best thing to do in the Marais is simply to wander, imagine, and get lost."

Marais starts to wake up around noon on Sundays adn if you go around 11 it's nice to stroll before the streets get busy with shoppers, falafel fans, and people converging on the Place des Vosges. The Musee Carnavalet is definately worth a visit - if just to see the fabulous 'hotel' it is housed in. Beautiful. Marais has a great vibe and it's a unique part of Paris."

Queues of young and not-so-young wait for falafels or a seat in a favourite cafe. You can pause for a coffee and a pastry, or find a corner bar for a drink.

No iconic sites or particularly grand buildings, but small shops, markets and all the elements of real Parisian life. The Jewish quarter is here too which you won't mistake. I've read one description of the Marais that compares it to Greenwich Village in NYC, which I wouldn't disagree with, similar in style, but quainter. We spent a happy few hours wondering around Le Marais."

We rented an apartment in the Marais, which was very well located and meant we could walk everywhere but on weekends it seems that this arrondissment gets swamped with tourists and those living on the outskirts of Paris. For us, there were just too many people to really see it and enjoy it on the weekends. Weekdays though, when you don't have the crowds it's definitely an area worth exploring, particularly around the Seine and closer to the third arrondissment."

Metro Station Hotel deVille was at the end of our block, and the neighborhood is populated with multiple charming bistros on every block. We rarely planned where we would dine, we just walked and ate where the spirit moved us - never a disappointment and never overpriced. The Marais is in the heart of the city with all tourist attractions easily accessible. Safe, friendly, very \"real\". I would heartily recommend renting an apartment in this arrondissment to have an authentic \"French\" experience without breaking the bank."

Studio apartment in the Marais districtApartment #654 rue des Gravilliers\u2013 75003 ParisOur apartment in Paris, booked through Special Apartments, was perfect for us. The office is just a short walk from the apartment, making check-in very easy. The two staff members we met, were extremely friendly and helpful. They walked with us to the apartment, pointing out things along the way, and showed us how everything worked, when we got there.It was a roomy, light-filled studio, with the bed located in a loft. The layout has been carefully arranged to ensure that the apartment feels spacious. It has been tastefully decorated to complement the old building. There are large windows opening on the street side, which were effective in keeping out sound, when we wanted to do so. It does have a lot of stairs, so you would need to consider this, when renting. On the ground level is a great Patisserie, and it is a very short walk around the corner to Arts et Metiers metro station. The small kitchen was stocked with quite a few essentials, and there is a supermarket a short walk away. The information folder supplied with the apartment is excellent, with instructions about everything in the apartment, and suggestions for trips, sightseeing, price-guides and restaurants.We booked for five nights and were sorry to leave at the end of our stay, as we felt very much at home in the apartment.I would highly recommend this apartment, and the Special Apartments company, for their professional and friendly service.Of course, the best part of this location, is the Marais district itself. There are many cafes, restaurants and bars to explore. The historic area is full of interesting architecture, including Place des Vosges, the Carnavalet Museum, a free attraction which traces the history of Paris, and the historic Jewish district, known as Le Pletzl, around the Rue des Rosiers, Near Arts et Metiers metro station is Musee des Arts et Metiers , dedicated to scientific instruments and mechanical contraptions. The Pompidou Centre is only a short distance away, and if you buy tickets in advance, it is easy to avoid the queues."

It's a maze of small, narrow, bustling streets, with hidden cafes, boutiques and feels very french. Napoleon didn't touch this part of Paris when he demolished many of the other smaller streets to make room for his great marching military boulevards. There are many small shops and eateries to be found in Rue des Rosiers, and Place de Vosges is a small haven of relative green tranquility. We continued along from a visit to Musee Carnavalet to Place Sainte Catherine and ate lunch in la Terasse de Sainte Catherine - they make a wicked club sandwiche. Vert d'Absinthe is a tiny green fronted shop at the bottom of the square where all kinds of absinthe memorabilia can be purchased, from books, posters, the tipple, to silver absinthe spoons and glass goblets."

The building now houses a very interesting museum, which I could best describe as an overview of Parisian history. It's also free, which surprised me.We spent a few hours there seeing the various rooms and exhibits and then walked back through the Marais to our hotel (Le Bristol). It was a wonderful Sunday afternoon and it seemed that all of Paris was out for a walk. We did a lot of window shopping, stopped for some chocolates, and eventually had lunch at a bistro. We realized we could have spent a few days there, but unfortunately we had to leave Paris the next day. Oh well, now we have yet another reason to return."

The appearance of street lamps planted on the streets instead of hanging from the buildings tells you that you have arrived. Plan to go in the late morning or early evening. Not much is open or happening for the rest of the day. For the casual tourist, food is the main attraction, some middle eastern and some the remnant of eastern European taste. You can visit the site where the chief rabbi of Paris lived and pass several synagogues. But little remains or is offered to help the visitor understand the role that this ghetto played in the history of Jewish life in France."

Old extrordinary shops, bakeries, bookshops, giftshops, galleries...Old, amazing buildings, courtyards, small cafes and restaurants...Marais is a the same time old jewish neighbourhood and the gay friendly neighbourhood...you can see traditional jewish bakeries and other shops next to the gay and lesbian bookshops. Le Marais is a great experience."

Walk down Rue de Rivoli which becomes Rue Saint-Antoine.There is a great diversity of shops and you are sure to find a number of them that you just get the urge to enter.Go down some of the side streets. There is also plenty to see there as well.There are also many places to stop and have snack and a drink.Word of warning! Watch your pockets! Pickpockets and bag-snatchers are waiting for the unwary. Crime is rife in Paris (not as bad as Marseille which is the crime capital of Europe, but not good), so protect your bag and your wallet very carefully."

I've stayed in this district many times over the last 25 years, a few times on my own, or with friends, my daughter, my husband. While I love the area, for its' architecture, cutural history and variety of restaurants and shops, it is not for everyone for, in my opinion, several reasons. VERY noisy almost anywhere you stay, and into the very early morning hours, because it is a real urban neighborhood and because it is full of bars and clubs that are hopping each night, late! VERY crowded especially in the evenings and nights, slowing your progress and forcing you into the streets that are often narrow and allow room for a car OR a person but not both. The gay culture is the dominant fact of life in this area and contributes to the late night bar scene which fuels the noisy atmosphere. There is a LOT of remodeling and construction going on and it begins early in the morning and closes streets, jamming car traffic, causing horns to blare and drivers to curse. On my most recent stay I found this to be more irritating and tiring than I have previoulsy which causes me to alert new travelers or even returning visitors, proceed with caution!"

For those who prefer kosher food, it is also close to or part of the Jewish area.We discovered a large green park which was established by one of the earlier King Louies sometime during the 17th century. Enclosing this park on all sides were beautiful buildings erected in the 1800's which allowed this park to become a quiet oasis in a busy city. My wife discovered that Victor Hugo also lived here during the 19th century and we went to visit his apartment which was now a small museum.--no charge for this.. . In the morning we saw the children out with their parent or nanny enjoying the park and its tranquility. Lunch time we saw many of the working folks sitting on the grass, perhaps near one of the 6? magnificent fountains and enjoying lunch. Late afternoon, the kids were out doing their fun things and early evening, it appeared that everyone was out, from the parents with children to older folks just enjoying the beauty and peace of this green respite.If we were to return to Paris, we would probably stay in this area and use the Metro and/or bus system to navigate Paris.which we did very easily during our visit.

There are gorgeous narrow streets that really make you feel like you've gone back in time.We went on a Monday afternoon and took a walking tour, which seemed like the best way to get a feel of the place. The tour took us from the Ile St Louis through Le Marais and ending up at the Bastille. At the end we headed back to our favourite part of the tour, le Marais, ate a late lunch and people-watched. As we only had a few hours to spare I didn't get the chance to go into any of the amazing looking shops which is my one regret! A re-visit to le Marais will be top on my to-do list when I am next in Paris.Tip - I've heard le Marais is a great place to visit on Sundays, as all the shops are open whereas in other parts of Paris they may not be."

You can walk to the Left Bank and we made it all the way to St.-Germain-De-Pres and back in one day. Great fun! Lots of metros and very close to Chatelet (a major metro and RER hub). Cool boutiques (Zadig & Voltaire, COS France, Lacoste, etc) and great food (pizza, falafel, upscale restaurants). Definitely spend lots of time there, and make sure to check out Rue des Rosiers, and some streetside art galleries: great fun, but watch out for pickpockets on the little streets as it does get very crowded at times."

I have spent a lot of time in the Marais over the years, perhaps because I'm gay, thinking that it is an advantage to be in a place with a lot of other gay people, but my conclusion 15 years ago and my conclusion now is that the advantages aren't that apparent. Sure, you may be able to find a quiet bar here and there where you might meet someone, but I don't find the guys in Paris to be that friendly, and the \"little group\" mentality seems to be alive and well. I generally prefer more working-class neighborhoods; this one is chic and filled with boutiques I cannot afford and still lacks enough tantalizing restaurants for a town the size of Paris. That said, it is wonderful to walk the streets of the Marais, looking above at beautiful buildings and peering into all the unique cafes and checking out whomever happens to be there. There are also some good boulangeries here and there. I think exploring the place with someone else adds a lot of value, so if you have the chance to bring a good friend or a few others to enjoy the cafes and bars, it is a great place to spend an afternoon or evening."

But right before we left the states, we decided to try and spend a little time there on one of our free afternoons. I am sooo glad we did.We started the afternoon at the astonishing Hotel de Ville, one of my favorite buildings in Paris. We explored the bustling Rue de Rivoli until arriving at Place des Vosges. We had an amazing time there watching the children play in the grass, the couples walking hand-in-hand, and just enjoying the chance to see the locals do what they do on a daily basis. We went to a wonderful little patisserie nearby and picked up some macaroons and then took them back to enjoy at the park. Hating to leave, we then headed west and just had a blast exploring the side streets with their cozy shops and cafes crowding the roads until we reached Rue Rambuteau. We headed south towards the Pompidou Center down Rue Saint-Martin and stopped into the beautiful Saint Merri church. Afterwards we continued south until we hit Rue de Rivoli and soon back to the Hotel de Ville.We had a wonderful time exploring but had simply ran out of time. I can't wait to go back because there are so many other side streets, cool shops, and classic Parisian culture we want to experience. We loved this little taste of Le Marais."

Take your pick and stroll around the many museums, churches, galleries and famous streets: try to visit the Jewish Quarter, Hotel de Ville, Rue de Rivoli and Place des Vosges (all towards the south) and be sure to try a falafel, an ice cream and some wine or beer from a bistro. People watching is what it's all about and can be great fun, and not too expensive.There are some very good eateries...Finklesteins & falafels in Rue des Rosiers...Robert & Louis in Rue Vielle du Temps...Cafe des Musees in Rue de Turenne all provided us with really good food...and everywhere are good bars and plenty of small shops..Do be warned though...it can become crowded in July and there are many down & outs and beggars/con artists who frequent the tourist traps. Graffiti is on the increase and not all the streets , benches & pavements are as clean as you would wish.

The one interesting store we did find was a guy that sold keys to locks from the middle ages. Very interesting, but you had to be willing to pay 300 Euros plus to take one home."

Le Marais, translates literally as \"the marsh\" and is without a doubt the trendiest and most beautiful area of Paris.I am very biased I know but I wouldn't stay anywhere else. It is not only one of the oldest areas but a wonderfully safe area close to all attractions that can be walked easily both night and day. Predominantly gay and Jewish, there are exquisite upmarket shops, great cafes, restaurants, wonderful buildings built by the aristocracy, fine sculptured gardens and art galleries everywhere set off narrow cobblestoned streets.The centre of arrondissement 3 & 4 is the glorious Place de Vosges-Royal Square, the finest square in the whole of Paris. Hotel De Sully can be accessed from a corner of the square along with Victor Hugos house at No 6.From the Bastille ( French Revolution monument) the Opera House is worth a look for a performance and Arsenal has some excellent cruises quite cheaply priced along the Seine and River Marne with Canauxrama, just 5 mins from the monument. It is worth getting lost on foot for 4 hours in this character filled area. Rue des Rosiers is the centre of the Jewish Quarter and has some great places for a good meal while Rue St Antoine runs through the centre of the Marais and has lots of pastry shops, cheese shops, wine merchants and in general terrific shopping. An extension of Rue St Antoine is Rue de Rivoli making all attractions close on foot. (Louvre, Notre Dame etc) From Charles De Gaulle Airport take the RER train to Gare Du Nord and change to the orange line for Bastille(Direction of Place D'Italie) Tickets for the Paris Metro should be bought in groups of 10 (carnet) for E12.50. Otherwise an individual ticket costs E1.70 Don't forget to check out the Musee Picasso, Musee Carnavalet, Musee de la Chasse et de la Nature and Musee de la Poupee ( Doll Museum) All are good value."

I always stay in the Marais area at Hotel du 7th Art. I love the resturants and the shopping. The Village St. Paul is a new and growing place. It's right at Rue St. Paul and St. Antoine. The Metro is right there and on Line 1 you can go anywhere. When you get there get a \"carte\", 10 tickets and you will save time waiting in line each day. Although the new computer machines make getting a ticket very easy. Remember to press English on the first screen. Works great. My tips for Paris;1 - Learn the Metro before you get there. It will take you anywhere. At St. Paul metro they will give you a great metro map.2 - Learn some basic introductory French. Greet eveyone with \"Bonjour\" to start with and if you don't speak French, say nicely, \"Parlez-vous englais?\" and they will probable answer \" impour\" ,a little, but they will appreciate you tried. The French are very polite more than us Americans, get used to it. Enter any store or restaurant please start with \"bonjour\". Don't stand there telling them in English you don't speak French. They will just walk away.Their not being rude, just just don't know what your saying.3 - Lean some basic Menu items you will be interested in.4 - Walking in Paris is just wonderful. There is history everywhere. It is nice, it is clean, it is safe.5 - Get you Euro exchange in the states before you leave. Do not do exchanges at any airport.In Paris the best place is the railroad stations, \"Le Gare\", The locals go there.6 - If your in the Marais area them go down St Antoine to Place Bastille. Very nice.7 - Them wlak down rue Lyon down to Gare Lyon, the fabulouse train station. You've seen it in so many French movies, The great film \"Le Femme Nikita\" has a scene that shows the the interesting restaurant \"Le Train Blue\". A great place to visit. 8 - If your into French films as I am, then please visit Place Vendome, in the 1st. The Hotel Ritz and so many interesting places and stores are there. \"Place Vendome\" is the movie that made Catherine Deneuve a star. And check out the old movie \"Hotel du Nord\". The hotel is still there. Every year I have lunch there and the walk along the canal all the way back to the Marais and my hotel. I love the walk.9 - This year, in June, I visited all the places that Woody Allen used in his wonderful movie \"Midnight in Paris\".10 - I'm 75 years old and had terrible jet lag this year. So when you arrive, take it easy, 11 - Their restaurants are a bit different from what we americans are used to. You sit down and after a while someone might come over to serve you. You will carefully explain what you want and how you would like it cooked and the waiter will listen and bring it to you the way he thinks it should be. But it will tast great and you will enjoy it and after you will ask for a check and an hour or so later they will bring you one.12 - Paris is a wonderful place to visit. Please give yourself enough days and time to appreciate it. Don't rush around and make it all a generality. If you take your time, you might fall in love with it. I did !!"

If you don't have time to visit Versailles, or if you don't want to fight the crowds; I would go to the Carnavalet. Another fun thing to do in the Marais is to go to the Enfants Rouge Market area for an ethnic lunch. The food stalls serve great, inexpensive Moroccan, Lebanese and Chinese dishes.

It is, as the guide told as, next to Saint Germain and the Latin Quarter the only area of Paris that has survived the 19 century, and it is really visible. Very different from the rest of Paris, here is where you will get the most authentic experience of the parisian life. The only thing I did not like was the overwhelming crowd - it is sometimes even difficult to walk. But apart from that, a very sweet area and a must while you're in Paris."

This is a fashionable, colorful, artsy, fun area to visit. And almost everything is open on Sunday, unlike the rest of Paris. Start at the Place des Vosges, a lovely park filled with Sunday families and young people, and then explore the many art galleries, shops, the Hotel Carnavalet (Paris Historical Museum), and brasseries. Needing a rest, we stopped to enjoy lunch at Camille Restaurant on the rue des Francs Bourgeois. It's classic French bistro food, at a moderate price. The Marais is a wonderful place to go when you want to experience a lively and thoroughly \"in-the-moment\" part of Paris."

More streets than you can keep track of, so if you find a shop, bakery, cafe or brasserie that you like, STOP and get your fill because you won't find it tomorrow (or even later the same day)! With basic traveler's practicality and common sense, Le Marais seemed very safe in the time period I would be out (10am - 10pm). It's a very upscale neighborhood and very busy. There are always people out and about.Chic boutiques and jewelry stores, art galleries that will take your breath away, true Parisian charm with the historic buildings, narrow streets and hustle and bustle. I couldn't have asked for more of a Parisian experience than to live in Le Marais for eight days. I missed it as soon as my airport shuttle was pulling away."

Time to smell the roses. Backtrack alonf Francs-Bourgeois, left on Pavee (where we saw a 2 motor scooters accident). Right on Rosiers, where soon you are in the real Jewish quarter, yamulkas, torahs, and falafels, and all. Now, right on Vieille du Temple, left on Blancs Manteaux.You are in the thick of Marais, and you can work your way out to the St. Paul or Hotel de Ville metro station.We loved this trip - stopped for \"some refreshments\", and headed home.Yes, the Marais is wonderful, and worth a 2 hour visit.Maybe even a rental here the next time."

There are tons of stores here from small boutique start up brands, to designer labels/brands. There are many cafes, restaurants and bakeries much like the other neighborhoods.The crowd here tends to be much younger you will see in the rest of Paris. I'm sure the typical age of the tenant in the area runs much younger vs. other areas of the city.We had a wonderful lunch at Cafe Charlot. DEFINITELY head over to Place de Vosges park which is beautiful with 4 water fountains in each corner of the park. Plenty of benches and also grassy areas to have a picnic lunch. Also, it was nice there is free wi-fi in the park. You just have to log on to the page and sign up and you get 2 free hours. We logged on perfectly with our Ipads.There are several nice restaurants around the Park as well pretty much on all sides with a good view of the park so we'll come back here and eat at one of them. A really cool and vibrant area to walk around in."

It was the first time that we had seen this neighborhood, and while we weren't sure that we would want to stay in this area, it was great to see it. We enjoyed the Carnavalet Museum and the Shoah as well (though it is hard to say \"enjoyed\" about the Shoah...more like appreciated). We would visit this area again."

One of my favourites is an independent store owned by a stylish lady who married an Englishman (that's why we can communicate effectively).

I was looking to give a review of Le Verrerrie by Paris Bestlodge at Le Marais but didnt find it as a selection last year so I didnt even try. But, researching another trip this year, I found myself reminiscing about our wonderful trip to France last year and how helpful all the reviews were. So here's my way of giving back... as late as it is. I still didnt find a section for ParisBestLodge under accomodations so this is the best section I could find.I contacted Thierry from Paris BestLodge to inquire about some of his one bedroom availabilities. I was originally looking around the 7th, but I'm so glad that we settled on 4th. It is so central and close to everything. Le Marais also has a wonderful flavor that I dont think the other arrondisements have. The restaurant selection was great and it's close to transportation.We were able to walk everywhere! We even walked to the Eiffel Tower a couple of times (once at night and once during the day). And this is with a 5 year old (not quite even). A good stroller helped so much. Dont know what we would have done had we not brought a stroller with us. She got tired from walking but the stroller helped us get around and she had no complaints. She even fell asleep a few times giving us more time to look around.I originally contacted Thierry for a different place and he offered us ParisVerrerrie. A one bedroom apartment with a sofa bed. It was perfect on the 3rd floor (no elevators though) and we loved this little quaint apartment. it had a very small kitchen that suited our needs. Dealing with Thierry was so easy. He then had us in touch with the apartment owner Eric and he was wonderful and helpful too. I had to mail a cheque for a deposit but they never cashed it. i then paid them when we met when we arrived at the apartment. They are so trustworthy.The only small issue we had with the apartment was that the hot water was a little on the sporadic side but it was not a big deal overall. Hopefully it's fixed now.Anyway, if you wanted to find a good reliable central place to rent while in Paris, I would totally recommend the 4th Arrondisement and ParisVerrie offered by ParisBestLodge at paris@parisbestlodge.com.Have fun in Paris. One of our faves is our visit to Monte Marte."

Go to Hur\u00e9 for macaroons and bread. On Rue des Rossiers try the falafels at Mi-Va-Mi. They are great. Place des Vosges on Sunday is fun. There are musicians performing around the square, and the artwork is amazing. It wouldn't be a complete trip to Paris without ice cream at Berthillon.

He is just perfect for this arrondissement! You will get to go to the best of the Marais, those little shops that have been around for years where you can sample some of their specialities. Talk to the owners and have them recommend the best of what they have to offer. He gives you history with an entertaining touch! No boredom here. This is also a fabulous place to find those presents to bring home! You can walk most of the Marais it is not as big as it looks on the maps.

Its a lovely square where you can have a picnic and people watch or just take a nap.

The staff ran around front to staff another register, whereupon it became apparent he did not have the money for his purchase. Ordinarily, I would step up and volunteer a few pence to help a guy out, but he was so loud and obnoxious, openly challenging shoppers in the queue to give him the money.

What I like the best about the Marais is the atmosphere, the small streets and shops, the best falafel I've ever had, sitting in a cafe overlooking the Place de Vosges, the Musee Carnavalet (which is free and a fascinating place for learning about the history of Paris), the market on Saturday morning, and the ease with which you can walk to the Marais from other areas."

The last time we were in Paris we stayed in an apartment close to Gare St. Paul. It was a great decision because we were close to everything we wanted to see. The location was truly perfect as we were right in the midst of all the action. And what action it was! Because the Marais is a micrososm of everything Parisian, you could highlight a hundred or more things. For me, I loved the cultural diversity of the people. At the Marais, you will encounter businessmen, bohemians, people from the Jewish quarter, entertainers, crazy people, colourful restaurants, gay bars and lots of young people. The Marais has a 24/7 liveliness, it is so busy and entertaining. It has its share of museums and historic sites if that is what you want. However if you are interested in the day to day French lifestyle and you like people watching, the Marais is definitely the place for you.Tip: If you have a lot of luggage like we did, getting a cab to CDG can be a tricky business. We discovered a large taxi rank right outside St Paul Station. To our pleasant surprise, the fare for the maxi-cab was the same as for a smaller cab, Only 35 euros! ."

The best time to visit is on a Sunday when many Frenchman and their families visit, when the shops are open and the area is very colorful. There are at least 5 falafel stands to choose from for a quick lunch and delicious bakeries in the area. My daughter and I enjoyed the most delicious \"moon\" cake (which is made of poppy seeds) at one of these bakeries on the Rue de Rosiers, the main street in the Marais. Nearby is the Place des Vosges, a lovely park surrounded by art galleries. Also the museum dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust is in the Marais and has free admission. Do not pass up on visiting the Marais section of Paris."

I started at the Bastille (and learned more about Bastille Day at the Carnavalet Museum). There are numerous restaurants in the neighborhood, and lots of small boutiques and great up-scale art galleries. The streets are very narrow and cobblestone. Place des Vosges attracted many students and mothers walking their babies. Very important while in France \u2013 watch out for dog poop on the sidewalks!

Try the small streets, so you can find really nice gardens that you can seat and rest a little.You can find many types of food there, but the best option is the \"Falafel\", a traditional mediterranean meal. It's good, big and with a very good price (5 euros - August 2011, for a traditional one).The Victor Hugo's house is in this neighborhood and it's free to visit, so it worth going there to take a look!"

However, I did walk about 15 miles in a day....as a warning. There are buses and the metro too but in this trip I did not use them.

Do some smart shopping in the Village Saint Paul- several interconnected back yards with delightful artisan shops."

The Marais could well be the exception however: very nice architecture, little traffic, great and varied food, lots of art galleries...This is where the Jewish district stands, around \"Rue des rosiers\".

It was a good decision and I would like to thank all those reviewers who led me to this wonderful place. Le Marais has many sights , sounds and smells to recommend it. From the grand Hotels ( mansions of an earlier era when French kings and artistocrats lived here), each with a history of its own, to the perfectly symmetrical Place des Vosges, interesting churches, great museums ( Picasso-- closed till spring 2013 --, Carnavalet, Cognacq-Jay, Museum of Jewish history, Parisian boutiques , cafes , restaurants and an infectious Parisian ambience, I left Le Marais with a heavy heart . It will , most likely , be my base for future visits to Paris."

Everything you will nee is with ten minutes from any starting point. If you enjoy diversity, safety and a sense of fun stay or visit this village withing a city. Reminded me of a cleaner and by far safer than Soho of London or the Village in Manhattan ( without slighting either!) I got the sense that people actually live and work there. Cafes, churches, museums, department stores and interesting architecure and lively bars everywhere. The Marais is not a mjor tourist destination for me. It is a cosy neighbourhood, which i was happy to return to after doing the major must see things in Paris."

There are many cafes, bars and stores to explore, as well as Centre Pompidou and many cinemas. It's also full of colorful, stylist Parisians, making it perfect for people watching."

            "review": "A moveable feast.... If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast. That is a quote from Ernest Hemingway in which I relate to\u2026 as it captures everything about my experience in Paris\u2026 for it was a moveable feast for all the senses. As a young person, it has remained a part of me, no matter where I am! After my time serving with the Peace Corps, I required a much needed holiday... I needed to retreat to a place that has always intrigued and inspired me. A place where I could write, play my violin, wear a scarf... and be myself. That place was Paris. In Paris...I could live life... not live at as a spectator looking-in... but as an actor looking out.  There are 20 neighborhoods of Paris. Each one with their own fabulous restaurants, souvenir shops, \"Marlboro Red stenched\" night clubs and pockets of quiet beauty... but for the sake of time, I can only share one neighborhood with you...Le Marais.  I chose to speak about Le Marais as it was the neighborhood where I spent the most time. I rented a wonderful, modern, fully-furnished loft there in a historic building built in the 19th century.  I would describe Le Marais to you all as an oasis of calm during the day\u2026 and an oasis to the night lovers. It is good for life seekers... bar hoppers... pastry lovers and foodies.  Speaking of food... Le Marais offered me a diverse selection of restaurants and cafes, from traditional French bistro fare to ethnic cuisine, all within walking distance from my apartment\u2026 I remember eating at at this restaurant called, \"Le Petit Dakar.\" The people who worked there were so pleasant and I ate the best \"yassa.\" Yassa is a famous Senegalese dish that has become popular throughout Western Africa. It comes with chicken that has been marinated for a long time in lemon juice served with couscous, onions, chile pepper, peanut oil, and seasoning. It is also eaten with your hands and it is cooked in a large pot over a flame. I also spent much time eating and drinking at Caf\u00e9 Hugo. This Cafe is the \"preferred\" caf\u00e9 on the Place des Vosges. Place des Vosges is the oldest and some say the most beautiful square in Paris. Its history and construction date all the way back to 1612. Caf\u00e9 Hugo is a great place for meeting people or just sitting and sipping a Merlot and breathing second-hand some while watching the world go by. It\u2019s a drinks only place... But for dessert\u2026I loved \u201cLe Petit March\u00e9\u201d\u2026 their chocolate mousse was a revelation...and their cr\u00e8me brulee was divine\u2026 for it was super decadent, dense, creamy, thick and made from goats milk. Two of the chief attractions in Le Marais are the Mus\u00e9e Picasso and the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet.  The house where Mus\u00e9e Picasso is located was built between in the 1600s and it is considered to be one of the finest historic houses in the Marais. The museum has paintings, drawings, sculptures, prints, photographs, manuscripts, newspaper clippings and photographs. It was nice; however, I am more of an impressionist art admirer. Picasso doesn\u2019t do much for me. I like Edgar Degas.  Now the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet was spectacular. It had has thousands of paintings, drawings, engravings, photographs, sculptures, pieces of furniture, ceramics, decorations, reliefs, signs, and coins. To me, it is the second best museum...(of course) after the Louvre. I suppose my two most favorite items there was this long narrow canoe made from a single tree trunk that dated back long before Julius Caesar and all the paintings of the famous actors in the drama of the French Revolution. In the courtyard of this museum, there was this huge sculpture of Louis XIV, the Sun King to greet visitors. I can go on and on about Paris\u2026 when I wasn\u2019t drinking or flirting or eating or at the museums or at the nightclubs, I did find time to write, play my violin, wear a scarf... and be myself. It was a moveable feast for all the senses. As a young person, it has remained a part of me, no matter where I am. Like Gertrude Stein Said\u2026 America may be my country\u2026 but Paris is my hometown."

There's something to see around every corner. Great ethnic foods in this historically Jewish section of days passed and now food of all nations can be found here. Plaques throughout the area tell of the events here in the 1940's. This is an area to be enjoyed both day and night. Daytime activity of shoppers and merchants gives way to evenings of music and schmoozing over a glass of wine in one of the many sidewalk cafes. Spend some time here, anytime of day or night."

The buildings are old, the streets are calm, many alternative shops and boutiques very expensive some other less, lots of food and drink bars, and a short distance walking to the city center and main atrractions makes le marais in the most chic and trendy area now in the french capital."
