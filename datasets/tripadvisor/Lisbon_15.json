Went back to visit the cloisters on the first Sunday when the admission is free. There was a HUGE line but it moved very quickly. Also visited the Maritime Museum at the far end of the building--separate admission but free the first Sunday of the month. Wonderful ship models.

The monastery is perhaps the second most significant portugueses monument, all made of limestone and decorated with motives linked to the maritime discoveries of the portuguese. As usual in monasteries a church and a cloister attract the most attention and display delicate stone work dating from the 16th century. Not longer with its steps on the river Tejo due to landfill, it is connected to a construction dated of much later (XIX century) where the Etnographic and the Navy Museums are installed and has the Tower of Belem and other monumnents as its neighbors (see photo). In the church of Jeronimos two tombs can be seen that epitomize the splendor of times past : 1)that of the epic poet Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, deceased at the verge of the loss of the indepence of Portugal, at the end of the 16th century, and 2) that of Vasco da Gama who led the navigators around the Good Hope Cape into India for the first time in 1492. A visit that leads to a double reflection: A) How could such a small kingdom assert itself in various domains across the globe, for so long?, and B)Why did Portugal lose so fast not only its geopolitical power, as dive into poverty and illiteracy of all types that led it to some of the worst indicators in the western world? Thoughts for a nice touristic and cultural visit."

Tip #1 - I had first gone to the side of the building where there is an entrance for the Cathedral. Just inside the entrance a person is there to collect a small fee to enter the church. Luckily I decided not to enter at that time, walked around to the main entrance where there was another door to the Cathedral with a sign \"Free Entrance\". Tip #2 - If you have the Lisboa Card you can skip the long line. If you don't have the Lisboa card, you can head next door to the Museu Nacional de Arqueologia and buy your ticket for the Monestary as well. Funnily enough, there are signs telling visitors this, but everyone insists on standing in the one line for upwards of 30+ minutes to enter even though the line next door is considerably shorter. Once you enter, you're immediately brought out to the cloisters, which is the centerpiece of this building. The warm color of the limestone that has been carved into gorgeously ornate shapes is a sight to behold. It's truly lovely and unique. The easy layout allows for random wandering through the cloisters and yet also guides you easily through several rooms with insights on the day-to-day of the monks who once lived there. There is gorgeous tile work in a few of the rooms, as well. As I mentioned above, there is a lovely gothic cathedral to tour either before or after your visit to the Monastery. If you enter the Monestary, there's the opportunity to go onto the balcony that has an amazing overlook view of the Cathedral."

It continues to amaze me that the architects and builders were able to build these substantial structures and have them survive so well. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and were treated to see a wedding take place in the cathedral. Using our Lisboa cards and we were granted free admission. Further, the train ride's cost was covered by Lisboa card. My only caution to visiting here is that the lines for admission get quite, quite long. Visit here early if you can.

Apparently this monastery is the most visited place in Lisbon.I caught the tram 15 from outside the Cais do Sodre station at what appeared to be rush hour in the morning and it was absolutely packed. You can catch any of the trams 15 that state Alges as the final destination as they stop right at the Monastery. The queue for tickets was very long and bus loads of people arrive so it is a busy place. We were told to go to the Museum entrance to get tickets as the queue wasn't as long, but it still seemed rather slow. It is definitely worth getting a ticket that combines the Monastery and the Belem Tower otherwise you will stand in a long queue again at the tower. The price for the museum, tower and monastery for an adult was 16 Euros which seemed very reasonable. However, if you only want to visit the church at the Monastery then it is free entrance, you just have to make sure you are in the correct queue.Although it was very busy, once inside the cloisters it actually seemed very peaceful and not crowded at all. The carving on the stonework is truly spectacular, the columns and arches look as if they are made of lace, so beautiful and individual. You can go upstairs to the upper level for a better view and an opportunity to go into the church and see it from the gallery. This church is truly wonderful, the pillars seem to grow from the floor and branch out across the vaulted ceiling, I have seem many beautiful cathedrals but I was blown away by this one.You can access the church again when leaving the monastery.The museum at the monastery is small and I couldn't really see its relevance to the rest of the site. I would recommend a trip to the monastery and church. For a good view of the site climb to the top of the Discoveries Monument across the park."

When you arrive the long frontage is amazing with incredible carved decoration and this is carried through into the cloisters and church. The cloisters are on two levels, rather than the normal single level, and the carved limestone was sublime. Inside the church the intricate rib vaulted roof is supported by soaring thin columns which you would not believe could take the weight. This is probably the most impressive and best preserved ecclesiastical buildings I have visited.Unfortunately the big downside was the long queue to get in and the very slow procession of tourists shuffling around the church on a one way system so it was difficult to take in the overall beauty of the building.As an aside, if you are hoping to catch the 15E tram to Belem from Lisbon please be aware that it was not running the whole distance when we were there (due to road improvements) and the replacement bus service was abysmal so we ended up catching a taxi. I believe it should be back in service in November/December 2016."

Then head to Torre Do Bel\u00e9m, 1st part of pass (5-10 min walk) and go upstairs to the line up to go up the tower. We made the mistake of going downstairs first and the line up was too long, so we skipped climbing to the top.Next go have lunch at the Museum of Contemporary Art. They have a cafeteria (4th floor) and a small bar (ground floor). If you are an art lover, go see the museum - it's amazing. If not, head over to a small bar-cafeteria at the Naval Museum just west of the Monastery. It's very nice there too. Head over to the Archeologic Museum (2nd part of pass). This is a great museum that offers a great historical view of ancient Portugal. Housed in a long, elegant wing makes the visit very enjoyable.Finally around 3-4 pm, go see the monastery (3rd part of pass). Why then? The crowds are smaller but more importantly, the late afternoon light makes the building glow with a red light and the building is more sublime.Remember with a pass there is separate entrance for ticket holders to all sights. To go up and see the cathedral from above is free too and if you are tight on time, go see this because it is truly amazing.The monastery is truly a must see but the crowds are enormous. We arrived late around noon due to missing the #15 tram but the #564 ? bus also goes there, but takes longer. Check the timetable at Cais do Sodr\u00e9 stop for the exact bus route.All of these buildings are all in one area focused around a large garden / fountain so it doesn't take much time to walk to the next place (the tower is the furthest). Our trip to Bel\u00e9m was a must see but getting there almost ruined the trip.I hope this advice helps?"

Impressive Gothic Cathedral with unparalleled fine architectural details. The monastery also is nice to visit.

The church is quite beautiful as well and the tomb of Vasco da Gama is right at the entrance.The staff however... were HORRIBLE. You buy the tickets to the monastery from two useless old women that practically know no English (why would you have people like that work at a tourist attraction?). We asked questions and they only used hand gestures. Also, when we stood in line to get inside the monastery, another rude old woman came up to us (and several other people behind us) to move us to a different line. She didn't even give us an explanation and basically just screamed at us to move to another place. I think she might have thought that we had not yet bought our tickets or something, because when she later noticed that we were holding our tickets - she just left us alone (and didn't even apologize for the misunderstanding).This almost completely ruined our experience there and is why I'm going to rate is low. There's nothing worse than bad service and rude people.Also, you should go when there are less people there. I think you'd have a much better experience when it's less crowded."

We admired the exterior for a while and started waiting in the ticket line on the left but realized soon thereafter that you could actually go into the cathedral for free on the right, so we did that instead. For free you can see the sarcophagus of Vasco de Gamma, appreciate the gorgeous architecture, and cool down a bit in the peaceful interior if it is a hot day like it was for us! Take a look into the ambulatory for the sarcophagi balanced on top of elephants - a great reminder of Portugal's global reach through the ages!"

The ride was interesting, going through various neighborhoods and under a few highly elevated freeways. We reached Belem in about 20 minutes, and the stop is within easy walking distance to the monastery.We walked past a very long line of people 4 or 5 deep waiting to get into the church and queued up in a much shorter line for the cloister, which was 12 euros each and included admission to the Tower of Belem (hint: a huge bonus).The cloister was interesting: basically 4 wings on 2 stories around a lawn. In one corner there's a wash basin outside a very large tiled room which was the dining hall for the monks. There were also very small rooms which must have been confessionals, Plus on the 2nd floor there are more rooms and an entry to a veranda overlooking the adjoining church (there is no entry point to the church on the veranda).We left the cloister and walked around to the main entrance to the church. The line was minimal at this point. The inside of the church is beautiful, but I'd say the biggest drawing point for me was the tomb of the great Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama at the rear of the church.We left the church and walked across the street, through the Jardin da Praca do Imperio with its gardens, fountains and little old ladies selling cork jewelry, and proceeded to the Tower of Belem in about 15 minutes. There were 250-300 people in line to buy tower tickets, but since we bought the combo ticket at the cloister, we just walked to the front of the line and walked in!After seeing the tower we took a cab back to the town for late lunch. As we passed the monastery, I noticed the lines for both the church and the cloister were non-existent, so I figured the best time to go is mid to late afternoon (hint)Anyway, I glad we went. The monastery, church and tower are all must-see items in Lisbon, and are important historical and cultural sites"

As the queue was long, and temperature in excess of 30 degrees, I opted to just go inside and wander around myself. This monastery is very impressive and a great example of European Gothic Architecture, and Unesco has classified it as a World Heritage Monument. Just inside the door to the left was the tomb of Vasco da Gama. It was here that both he and the crew spent their last night in Portugal before leaving for India. There are also tombs of other Portuguese historical figures as you walk around. However, I will have to read up on these before my next visit. Had I queued for tickets I could have visited the garden, laid out in 1940's, which has hedges cut in the shapes of various municipal Portuguese coats of arms. I will definitely be returning to this monastery on my next visit to Lisbon - but will be more prepared!!!"

We then found out why - at 11am they do a changing of the guard ceremony at the nearby national guard museum. Entertaining and an unexpected bonus.The monestry is two things to visit- the cathedral building (queue to the right). At the time we visited it was packed but an interesting building with unique architectural features. Queue to the middle to get to the main monestry. This is a large intricately decorated building over 2 floors. For the British visitor there is limited information but we simply enjoyed looking around. I guess there might be a written guidebook for info but we enjoyed our visit without the urge for being educated! It was generally unfurnished. Queue no. 3 on the left was for the attached museum. We didn't visit. There was a small market nearby (not our thing) and the Torre is across the park in front. A busy but jolly ride got us home.Travel tip - Lisbon does a 24 hour travel card for a reasonable price. Pick one up at the metro station though there is a 50c charge for the rechargeable card.Don't forget to appreciate the exterior in your determination to visit the inside!"

At Jeronimos Monastery the large tour groups go directly into the church (free) while those buying individual tickets enter into the cloisters and have an opportunity to first see the church from the upper floor, flooded with tour groups. Enjoy the cloisters, the one museum like information room gives plenty of bilingual details on the history and building of the monastery and small rooms on the upper floors, while the church empties out of tour groups, then go downstairs; absolutely worth visiting slowly and at your own pace, without the tour groups. As other reviews have mentioned it's a UNESCO World Heritage site. Do spend time looking at the outside details. Clean bathroom near the ticket office. If you are a senior (over 65) they offer 1/2 off the admission ticket."

The cathedral was more austere and sombre, but equally befitting the reason it was built and exists in the first place. Great visit."

We went; it far surpassed our expectations with absolutely fabulous buildings -- architecture and fine carved stone work -- and wonderful displays -- especially one with a panorama of Portuguese history including the monarchs. .Also the tomb of Vasco de Gama who was the first to discover a route in 1497 from Europe to India. A must see; would could have spent on entire day there if we had the time."

It is only a short tram ride from Lisbon (take the 15E but make sure you get off at Belem-Jeronimos, one stop after the main Belem stop or you will have to walk a bit further). The stonework is amazing and there are some interesting displays on the history. The line to get in was quite large when we arrived but it moved quickly (we also discovered that there is a second ticket office inside in the museum, so go there if you can!). It was pretty busy with tourists so if you are looking to escape for some calm this is not the place to go in peak season. Also be aware it is closed on Mondays."

I have nothing against having the weeding, but they know this well in advance and the know what your comps noes are bringing groups the could advise the tour companies when the make the arrangments that a wedding is being held at a certain time and the tour companies foul rearrange there trips to visit the Momastery early before they close the church.

With a ticket for the museum+cathedral in hand, you can walk right past the pour sunburned souls sitting in the main line for hours. The museum and cathedral were definitely worth seeing, but the church was the most impressive structure by far. It\u2019s free, so if you\u2019re pressed for time or looking to save money, consider just making a pass through the church (the church entrance is next to the long ticket line)."

This spectacular monastery and church complex was commenced in 1501 and took over the next 80 years to complete. The original monks were those of the Order of St Jerome whose role was to look after seafarers and pray for the soul of the kings. The order was disolved in the early 19th century.Belem is some distance from Baixa, Chiado and the main area of the old town. We took the No.15 tram from Praca da Figueira.The downstairs of the church which houses the Tombs of the explorer Vasco da Gama and the poet Luis de Camoes, amongst others, was free to enter but you had to pay to enter the upper level of the church and the cloisters.The entrances to the church, cloisters and museums are very close together, so you need to take note of which queue you are in as it can be confusing. On the day we were there the longest queue was for the museums, which we did not visit, but many people who wanted to visit just the church had mistakenly hopped on this queue.The cloister area was beautiful and there was a great view of the interior of the church from upstairs. Also upstairs, in a separate room off the cloisters, was a fantastic historical presentation that contrasted key dates in the history of the monastery with key events in Portugual and the rest of the world. This was in Portuguese and English.Well worth the visit and journey to Belem as there are other attractions nearby."

Our guide treated us to a local delicacy at the end of our visit - pasteis de nato, like a custard tart, & delicious. I think he probably got them from the nearby Antiga Casa.

As was usual in those days, they seem to have ploughed a lot of money into matters connected with religion. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t have the equivalent of Henry the 8th who plundered and destroyed most of the monasteries in England. It\u2019s worth a visit\u2014at least to see how much time, money, effort and workmanship has gone into the structure. You can spend about 2 \u2013 3 hours here depending on how interested you are in the history behind this world heritage monument.After you have finished with this place, cross the road into the beautiful park/garden/square directly opposite the monastery. You can take some really good photos from here with the monastery in the background. If the weather is good this is a great place to picnic too. From here walk towards the Rio Tejo (Tagus River) and you will see the monument to maritime explorers\u2014Padrao dos Descobrimentos. You can take some fantastic photos with the monument, the river and the impressive Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge (2.2km long and 190m high) in the background\u2014all assuming the weather is good. The river is about 1.5km wide at this point. Once done, you may want to take a lovely stroll, going west from the monument, for about 500 metres along the river. Walk about 800 metres and you\u2019ll reach the Torre de Belem\u2014although you can\u2019t go in a straight line along the river after about 500 metres.How does one get here? From near Rossio Square (Figueira Square to be exact) take the E15 tram. It will be a 35-minute ride and mostly enjoyable once the tram gets out of the central area. If you have a Lisbon Card, entry is free.If you have the Citymapper app installed on your smart-phone you may find it very useful finding bus, tram and metro times, stations and stops."

We were the first ones in today, tip toeing into the empty cloister, refectory, and chapter room, surrounded by magnificent architecture and near silence. You can do it too. Get there early before 10am and stand in the line at the West entrance of the church. No matter that you are not among the first 30 in line. The secret? There are two ticket sales desks, the main one at the front of the line deep into that entryway; and another inside the same entrance at the left of the line within about 5 meters of the front of the building. We watched the desk open and swung to our left and were the first in line. Tickets in hand we walked to the front of the line (to the right) and walked right up to the ticket collector at the official entrance. Whether this works for you or not, get there early before the ticket offices open, because by the time we left the monastery around noon, the crowds were unbearable. Another tip: if you think like we did that the Tower of Belem was not worth the long wait in the sun, just buy a less expensive $10 ticket for entry into the monastery. If you want to just enter the church, you may do so at no cost as a tourist after 10am, or you may enter as a worshipper for one of the scheduled services. The church alone is breathtaking architecturally and historically. One more tip: do not miss the room on the top floor of the cloister that features a historical exhibit that is a presentation of the history of the monastery from its beginning in the 16th century to the present. It parallels that story with the history of the world at that time and the history of Portugal. To see the three paralleled provides learning worth spending an hour with. Enjoy!"

Refusing to queue in the baking sunshine, we returned at 3.30 and walked right in. It doesn't close until 6pm so this was plenty of time. Unfortunately I thought that the \u20ac10 entrance fee got you access to the whole building that you can see from the outside whereas actually we could only walk round a small fraction of it. The courtyard and stonework was beautiful, but not worth \u20ac10, I felt. I recommend getting a Lisbon card (\u20ac16 I think) if you plan to visit the monastery because after bus travel, and the entrance cost it worked out to be about the same price (free entrance if you have Lisbon card), or bring along a student/OAP card (only \u20ac5).

The workmanship on the carvings is remarkably impressive and inspiring.You can see the highlights in not much more than an hour. Whether you are spiritual/religious or neutral/antagonistic toward religion, you may well come away with awe as to what humans could accomplish centuries ago.Church is free to public and you can avoid the long lines. But with admission you get the access to the cloister which is lovely, tranquil and the carvings are remarkable as there are few, if any, repetitions.

The remainder of the monastery must have been repurposed for other things.Both the monastery and the archaeology museum are very nice to visit. That said, it wasn't nice enough to make me want to wait in the enormous queues outside the monastery ticket counter to get inside. I arrived 45 minutes before opening, and found maybe 50 people waiting already. This was doable. But by the time the doors opened the line was out towards the street and getting longer. The line at the archaeology museum was almost non-existent. Since both sell combo tickets which include the monastery, belem tower and the museum, maybe it is possible to buy a combo ticket and the museum, and slip inside the monastery without the long wait. Don't know if there is a catch there though since I didn't try.I do recommend visiting Jeronimos, but only if you can get in without a long wait. Otherwise it just isn't worth it to stand outside for 1 hour +, in my opinion. Better to find other things to do."

If you walk to the building entrance near the front of the long line you will see there is actually another entrance just to the left of the line of people waiting for the main entrance and just across from the \"chapel\" entrance. If you go into the alcove where the archeological exhibit entrance is you can buy the exact same tickets to enter the main monastery apartments that everyone is waiting on line for. Then you just walk up to the front of the line and enter. I think you can also buy them 100 feet to the left of the line at the museum entrance... check both before you wait!!"

It was very easy to get here by public transport. We hadn't realised that you need a zapping ticket on the metro to transfer to the Cascais train. Not a problem. The bus to Belem was just outside and only a few stops away which we could use our normal metro tickets. There was a wedding taking place in the cathedral when we got there, and although we couldn't go into the front altar side of the church we could go into the rear and look from the balcony. Well worth a view. The queue in the heat wasn't ideal but it moved quickly and the 8 euro fee was very reasonable. Once inside, we headed to the cloisters and we were blown away by their beauty. It is such a calm place and a beautiful breeze blows in was cooling the whole place. Even with the huge crowds in the city, we never once felt that there were others around. You could stay here for many hours and just take it all in. Truly mind blowing!"

This saved us a lot of time later as we didn't had to queue at the Tour.The Monastery is really beautiful and I've hugely enjoyed the exposition of the history starting from 1400. The exposition is well done as it shows the world and Portuguese history as well to give some context.We haven't tried what is described here below, so use it as you wish. When leaving the Monastery we passed the adjacent Archeological museum and saw that you can also buy tickets there for the Monastery (or any combination ticket). It looks as if you can buy the ticket here (no waiting line at all) and walk over to the Monastery where you can go directly for the pre-paid ticket line and pass the whole queue.

Visit lasted about one hour and a half. Outside very impressive, the church is interesting with the best view from the top of the stairs, accessed from the cloisters. It is the cloisters themselves that make the visit. The stone carvings are amazing. Well worth a visit."

There are several parts to this attraction. There is a fee to see the inside of the monastery, as well as separate tickets to the archeology museum and the maritime museum. However, entry to the church is free. The monastery is well worth a visit. It displays such grandeur, absolutely beautiful. It is well known and needs no further description. The archeology museum displays includes a room with Egyptian collections including mummies and various relics, a room of gold treasures, and a hall featuring ancient religions. I didn't have enough time to visit the maritime museum but have been told by other visitors that it is also worth visiting. The church itself is definitely worth seeing. Again, so beautiful and grand. Obviously arriving early would avoid queues, and they do get very long! However, if you can't get there early (like me), try getting the combined ticket from other attractions first. I visited the archeology museum first, and the queue was much shorter- the entrance is located at the left side of the monastery building. Also when i first arrived, there was an extremely long queue for the church. Later on I realised the wait was due to a wedding in the church, so everyone was just waiting for the service to end. So my advice is to check out what the queue is due to and consider coming back later."

Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery is one of the two UNESCO World Heritage attractions in Belem, along with the Torre de Belem. This is a delightful attraction where you will see excellent representation of Portuguese Late Gothic Manueline architecture. It is a real highlight for days spent in Belem. Opening Hours are 10-6.30pm daily (closed on Mondays) during the summer. Entry tickets are \u20ac10 or you can purchase combo tickets which include entrance to the Torre de Belem (\u20ac12). There is a further combo ticket for (\u20ac25) giving you additional access to the Nacional Arqueologia, Entnologia and two Coches Museums in Belem. Visits to Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery include free access to the attached Church of Santa Maria, which is well worth spending 15-20 minutes to enjoy prior to entering the rest of the Monastery. The South Portal in particular is a architectural highlight. The back entrance is also worth viewing. You'll find the Tomb of Vasco de Gama as a handful of Portuguese Royalty near the front chapel. The other major highlight is the open cloister where the churches outstanding architecture is on full display. Walking around the ground level and second floor provides delightful views into the cloister opening which is surrounded by richly decorated arches and inner walls. This is Gothic Manueline architecture at is finest, a beautiful, almost delectable sight to see. The cloister is worth at least 20-30 minutes to enjoy. Overall, we very much enjoyed our visit to Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery in Belem, spending just over an hour at this attraction. While there are several other rooms to see, focus your time on the church and cloister if you have limited time. In the end, this is a great attraction that you'll be glad to have seen."

I have been to the Vatican, and can attest to the fact that this place is equally impressive. How on earth did human beings build these structures with no power tools and earth-moving equipment? It was splendid to behold. They were preparing for some sort of service while we were there, so many of the young men in appropriate dress (priests? novitiates [is that the right word?] deacons?) were coming in with various musical instruments. Part of their costume was a humongous rosary, which reminded me of the ones the Dominican nuns wore when I was a child. Filled with columns and buttresses and all manner of accouterments one would expect in a grand cathedral. Gorgeous statues, ornately carved woodwork, and most of all, an incredible feeling you can only experience in a church. That was still there, even though the place was filled with noisy tourists. Even if you can't go inside, it's worth a trip over to Belem just to see the magnificent and imposing exterior. I would like to add that the staff were extremely kind."

Get there early! The monastery offered stunning views and detailed architecture with plenty of photo opportunities. The adjoining chapel is stunning and worth a look.

Turns out it is the ticket office of the Archeological museum. The combined ticket was just $2 euros more if we just purchase tickets for the Monastery (you can buy Monastery tix only.) A nice small museum. So take note if the ticket line is long come over to the museum and get your tickets! The church is free but the Monastery sells tickets onsite and it was well worth it. Grounds and structure are absolutely beautiful. We particularly enjoyed the 500th anniversary exhibit where you can soak in world history spanning 500 years in 30-40mins along with changes at the monastery. This became our favorite religious site second to Gaudi's church In Spain."

It took 100 years to complete the construction. It is close to Tagus river in the paish of Bel\u00e9m. It also housing Maritime Museum and National Archeology Museum.

When you visit you have an option to either go into certain areas free of charge or pay 10 euros each to visit more of the Monastery. We paid the money and to be honest were slightly disappointed. Everywhere else in Lisbon we felt we got more than our moneys worth but here somehow we didn't. Its good, its impressive but its not worth 10 euros each. The free bit is probably the most impressive bit, along with the outside view of the stonework which is also stunningly well done. I think they allow you into about a quarter of the Monastery even for the extra money. I don't want you to think we are penny pinching here, we are fine paying if we feel its worth it. Pena palace in Sintra for example or Palacio Nacional da Ajuda in Belem - both worth more than we paid frankly. I would advise family members to do the free bit and spend the 20 euros on a nice meal and a couple of glasses of wine. Your holiday, your choice."

There was a fairly large queue when I arrived but it didn't take that long for it to go down and I was in the place in about 15-20 minutes. The price to get it in itself was reasonable and the staff helpful. Inside, the Monastery was very chilled and well preserved and there was some nice views to see. The church at the side of it was very nice inside and you can go just go in there if you like for free with little or no queuing.

The paintings, tile works and wooden features are superb. The church, the cloisters, the gardens - amazing. There are a number of exhibitions which provide significant information about the history of the complex within the events in Europe and Portugal at this time. Staff could have been more helpful with information about the best way to look through the buildings. For the price paid the 1\u20ac guide should have been included rather than having to find out that one exists in the first place (after speaking to 3 staff) then needing to go upstairs to the shop to actually buy it. An audio guide to build some narratives around the many places of interest throughout the monastery would have improved my appreciation of the visit."

Go early in the day, as this place gets very busy and is susceptible to many tour parties who arrive at the front of the line and delay your entry while they are being processed. The museum is worth the additional cost. and explore the multi-location option ticketing system - that way you save money and only have to line up once. One of the intriguing exhibits was a panoramic display that looked at the history of the monastery, the history of Portugal, and the history of the world. The history of the building was interesting, the history of Portugal also of great interest; but most fascinating was the history of the world through Portuguese eyes - that was true educational. One of the things that is fascinating in Portugal is the recycling of heritage structures into different uses - whether it be a training school, a museum or a poussada. Very healthy approach."

You get access to the courtyard and the first floor terraces overlooking the courtyard, a small exhibition and then that's it... No wait.. There is the odd wheel barrow, some stones with decorations that might be under reconstruction scattered around the hallways , 100 chairs stuffed in a corner, a barrel of a cannon etc When you add that there is no brochures to give any form of background knowledge etc it left us with the impression of being more of a \"tourist trap\" than the wonderful display it could have been of Portuguese history and architecture - it has the potential, but lacking a few final touches."

The fee to see the cloister is nominal and well worth it. But go at 10:00 a.m. when the monastery opens. If you wait till 11, the line will stretch around the block."

However, on the uppermost floor, there was an informative and impressive timeline of World/Portuguese/then history of the Jeronimos Monastery that covers an entire room. To someone who isn't a big history buff, it was mildly interesting. I just looked at the photos and briefly scanned the descriptions. Looked as though a lot of work was put into it.I just read that the Monastery was the resting place for Vasco de Gama, but honestly, I think I missed during my visit. Was just a nice, cool (temperature-wise) place to get away from the sun. I didn't step foot in the courtyard at all as it was too hot and sunny.

But think about taking the Lisboa card at AskMeLisboa (tourist office) which costs just a little less than 20\u20ac and allow you to access freely to several monuments like Belem tower, the monastery, the Santa Justa elevator in the city and so on. Come to the monastery by tramway it is easier and more comfortable."

The convent was outside Lisbon, in empty land, and over the centuries building around it prevents taking it as an individual architectural piece. It is huge, so that it houses (from different fates) two different and interesting museums: the Maritime Museum in the west wing, and the Archeology Museum in the south door. Despite it's size (be prepared to walk around, and inside it), it's elegant and incredibly pleasant to the eye. Also, the well maintained gardens outside are wonderful to spend time, and enjoy the view of the early 17th century monument. Most visitors, familiar with the European Gothic style, may believe it's the same, but the Manuelino (by the name of the king who inspired it) may be considered a style in its own.Besides the usual places to visit that you may get by wiki, take your time to visit watch the funeral monuments of Camoens and Gama, and the intricate seals on the columns and arcs of the main church (each of those is different from the others - unique pieces - which has been proved now by modern study). For me, a visit to the cloisters is mandatory, to meditate on the poems inscribed on the funeral monument to Fernando Pessoa, Portuguese poet and philosopher, A monument that shall be enjoyed on a sunny morning - or a full rainy day, because you've enough attractions in it and the two museums to keep you happy. Outside there is the opportunity to eat at a variety of restaurants at a walking distance from the monument. My last visit was solo, but I always take my foreign friends there, and the \"rediscovery\" is always very emotional."

This church also contains the grave of Vasco de Gama. His grave is the one near the exit, not the one nearest the entry which looks very similar and was photographed by many visitors."

Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and decorated in the Portuguese Late Gothic Manueline style of architecture, this monastery deserves all the attention it receives. It really is a beautiful site to behold. The easiest way to get to the monastery from Lisbon is to take either tram 15 or tram 127 from the historical centre of Lisbon (the tram runs just in front of the Augusta Street Arch)There is a \u20ac12 combination ticket that includes entrance to the Belem tower, or a \u20ac10 ticket to just enter the monastery. I would advise you to purchase your tickets online especially if you'd like to go up the tower. Do not plan to visit the Monastery on Mondays, as it is closed to the public. The Belem Tower and the Monument to Discoveries are also closed on Mondays. I did not visit the Maritime Museum which takes up one wing of the Monastery, but as I went on a Sunday entrance to the National Archaeology Museum (another wing of the Monastery) was free."

The outside is absolutely awesome and you will find yourself clicking away with your camara. The huge church part of the monastery is free entrance and can get extremely busy with tour groups. The church has some colossal columns and gives a feeling of emense space. The monastery is 3\u20ac each to enter and you get a free guide and is well worth it to see the Cloisters that have two levels, a particular highlight with very detail architecture. Also you are able to get access to the high veiw point overlooking the inside of the church, only accessible from the monastery. There are public toilets inside and a good souvenir shop. There is plenty of parking however it is very busy and I would advise to use metro to Casa do Sodre station and from there you can get a train to Belem. From Belem it is a 10 minute walk towards the mouth of Lisbon. This journey will cost you less than 5\u20ac combined and you can use your Viva transport card on all. The whole journey will take less than 30 minutes. Get more advise from tourist information point at Rossio."

The negative side is that the place is pretty crowded, so in order to spare the long queues we went there at 10.00 in the morning, and enjoyed some 30 pretty calm minutes. After 10:45-11:00 usually most of the people come with touristic buses and trams and you can lose a lot of time just waiting to buy a ticket or to enter. Inside there is a quite interesting timeline, which shows on three paralel levels the main moments in the history of the monastery, the history of Portugal, and the history of the world.No elevator to the second floor, so I had to carry the baby stroller."

The cloister is outstanding, surely worth the visit. The price could be lower, but there are several \"reduced prices\" for students, etc.. There is a long line, it is better to go there early in the morning, even before opening time. The Church entrance is free and the Church itself is a really good example of architecture. Contrary to what some people say, there isn't much to visit in Lisbon, surely not much that sets the city apart from any other avarage city in Europe (not talking about big capital cities, but average cities). This monastery, and the Belem area, stand out instead."

One selling tickets, the other being busy at sticking the credit card receipts in a book!!!That leads to crazy long queuing times !3/ having the Lisboa tourist card won't prevent you from queuing up. Another aberration.Tip: don't pay to visit the Belem Tower. It's a nice walk along Tage river to get there. The tower is beautiful but you don't need to get inside. Since the place is small, you must wait to access each part of the tower and the view is not worth the time spent.Finally I find it unacceptable to arrange private visits of personalities during open hours while these could be arranged after working hours!!!!"

With beautiful and elaborate stonework, at times carved with the intricacy of lace or taking on the form of intertwined rope, the monastery is a \u201cmust-see\u201d. The two storey cloisters, chapterhouse, sacristy and church were built from 1501, with no expense spared as the construction was originally funded from the tax on commerce from Africa and the Orient, which was expanding at the time.The monastery was occupied by the religious order of Hieronymite until religious orders were dissolved in 1833 and is an outstanding example of Manueline architecture \u2013 richly decorated with maritime themes in the sculpture. Here, the sculpture is varied, intricate and occasionally witty. Later work moves into another style known as Plateresque, lavish decoration reminiscent of that on silverware.The walls of the refectory are covered in decorative 17th century tiling (azulejos), well worth seeing, and the Chapterhouse contains the tombs of Almedia Garrrett, Alexandre Herculano and two former presidents. The church transitions from late Gothic, as seen in the soaring vaulting, to Renaissance, with elaborate sculptural entrance doorways and has a number of important tombs including members of the royal family, Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es and Vasco da Gama.Admission to the cloister is free on the first Sunday of the month, and it is therefore very busy and you will have to queue, and you may have to allow some flexibility on timing to visit the chapel on the Sunday due to services."

We visited here on a wet day so it was quite crowded and we had to queue in the rain for a till with one person manning it until a guide pointed out that there was another till further in! Also, reading another review you can go in via the Museum of Archeology and buy a ticket for both for \u20ac12 (rather than \u20ac10 for just the monastery). The monastery was very interesting and had a display in Portuguese and English on 500 years of its history, Portuguese history and world history - very interesting. It would have look even better in the sunshine but you can't have everything."

The historic site is so beautiful with so many details carved into the alcantara stone. Make sure you go up on the second floor to see all the different rooms. Go there early as it gets very busy. The entrance to the church is free and is worth it. The tomb of Vasco de Gama is exposed in the church. Take a combination ticket with the great Tower of Belem so you won't have to stand in line when you get there."

Seriously, we counted seventeen tour buses parked outside the monastery on the Tuesday that we visited. Wall-to-wall tourists. The line wrapped all the way around the front of the building and did not move. We asked a couple of people mid-line and were told they'd been standing there over an hour. While it's quick and easy to get into the church, if you want to see the monastery and the beautiful cloister, you must contend with the line. Belem was already so crowded and touristy that the thought of waiting an hour or two in line for this one site was incredibly unappealing. We went and saw everything else there was to see in town, had a long lunch, waited in the line for pasteis de nata (much better than others we'd had and actually worth the 20 minutes in line) and took a walk along the waterfront to kill time. We headed back to Mosteiro dos Jeronimos at 3:00pm and the line was down to about a 15-minute wait. That was well worth it to enjoy this beautiful site. The cloister really is stunning.We heard after the fact that you can go to the museum directly next door and buy a dual ticket that allows you to bypass the line. I can't vouch for this, since we didn't try it, but it's another option.Belem tips: (1) Prepare to enter the inner circle of tourist hell (2) Be willing to either wait an hour+ in line or come back at the end of the day when the line is shorter."

It is a World Heritage Site since 1983. The outside is a blend of Moorish and Gothic styles. We arrived here on a Monday and found it to be closed since Monday is considered a day of rest after the busy Sunday mass schedule. There is plenty of parking, most of which is taken up by tour buses. As at most sites in Lisbon, you must run the gauntlet of souvenir hawkers on the streets outside the Monastery. There is much to see inside according to the information plaque on the front of the monastery, so plan to visit here on any days but Sunday and Monday. The Maritime Museum is also located in the Monastery and is closed on Monday as well. So arriving in Lisbon on a Monday was doubly unfortunate for us as both these places were on our tour.We did return to Lisbon another day the following week and the Monastery was open, but the line for tickets stretched for several blocks. I would suggest a check of the online site to see if tickets can be purchased in advance to avoid the crowds and the long waits. The Church however, was open. Just inside on the left as people file out of the church is the tomb of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. There is another tomb on the right as you enter but we weren\u2019t familiar with the name on the plaque. Apparently Vasco da Gama died elsewhere and his bones were moved to several places before being permanently interred in the Jeronimos Church. There are several other tombs of notable and historical personages inside the church as well. The church was beautiful with soaring ceilings and mighty pillars to hold it up, though not as ornate as some churches we have visited in Europe.The line of people visiting the church moved quickly and quietly, or you can step out of the line and move about at your own pace. So if you find yourself in Lisbon on a Monday and find the Monastery closed, you can at least pay a visit to the church."

We bought a combined ticket for the Mosteiro and the Torre de Belem which makes the price very reasonable. It's a good idea to time your visit as the Mosteiro gets busy - I imagine that tour buses arrive early morning (stopping in Belem on their way to Sintra) or late afternoon (on their way back from a morning in Sintra). We arrived shortly after midday on an April weekday and it was relatively quiet - when we left Belem some five hours later there seemed to be huge crowds of people around the Mosteiro. There are two parts to the Mosteiro. The 'church' is free to enter - entry being from the incredibly impressive south portal. The church with its fan vaulted ceiling is a masterpeice and in case you wonder why people gather round a tomb at the ntrance to take photos it's because its the tomb of Vasco da Gama. Even more impressive than the church are the Cloisters which you pay to enter. We were there for well over an hour marvelling at the carvings and the sheer majesty of the place. It's a photographers paradise - a truly beautiful building."

Manueline cloister is a triumph of natural details with its meticulously carved arches, ribbed turrets and spiral columns that have engravings of leaves, vines and nodes; there are the symbols of the era such as the armillary sphere and the Military Order of Saint George, and the gargoyles and fantasy creatures at the top level."

There was quite a large queue for one section of the monastery and a shorter one for another section so for time I only visited one section of the monastery. I can say, however, I was not disappointed. It was quite beautiful; it has an 'aura' about it that made it feel like you were almost experiencing it another time completely. It was quite busy so I let my group on occasion which meant I couldn't really focus on it all; I was too worried I might be left behind! So that spoilt it for me, but I can say that with a decent time frame to spend here I would have enjoyed it more. Due to this I would definitely recommend at least an hour or 2 (I could only spend about 30 mins here). I loved the architecture, the art and the cultural significance. It was definitely worth going to see and I would highly recommend it to anyone going to Lisbon."

The only \"issue\" is to get there - take a tram from the Lisbon center and expect approx. 30min ride with a hundreds of tourist :)"

The prettiest displays are the chapels in the church and the stained glass windows.

I think there is a certain time for the free admission though. Here are direction to go to the Monastery by Tram.We were on a cruise ship that docked in Lisbon at Santa Apolonia terminal. This is over an hour's tram/bus ride to Belem. However, it is very easy to get there by bus/tram or train. So, exit the Port, go left and walk along the waters edge until you get to Praca de Comercio Square, one of Lisbon's main square. The square is on your right. Praca de Comercio is also called Terreiro do Paco. It is about an 8-10 min walk. It is a stopping point for buses and trams etc. Look for the stop for Tram #15E, should be ahead to the left. We paid 2.85Euros each way per person. You can buy the ticket on the Tram from the machine, which takes coins and notes. The machine gives change. Or you can buy it at a Metro station before you get on the Tram. The 15E to Belem would say \"ALGES\" because that is the last stop, but Belem is before this, about the 13th stop. The tram stops right in front of the Monastery, so you will know when you are in Belem. You can also take Bus #728, which I think is about 2 streets over in front of Apolonia cruise terminal. \\ Look for the 728 going in the same direction you would have to walk to get to the square. If you take the bus you just sit on it until it arrives in Belem. It would also pick up passengers on its way at Praca de Comercio Square.  On the way back we took Bus # 728, across the street from the Monastery. The cost was less than the Tram...1.80Euros each. You can buy on the bus. We got off at Praca de Comercio and walked around to see Lisbon's city centre. It takes a different route, passing the the Alcantara Mar & Cais Sodre Train station. We saw different things on the way back. If you walk up the Main street by the Square you can get to Rossio Train Station where you can get Trains to Sintra to see the Beautiful Palace. I hope this is helpful."

The architectural style called \"Manuelino\" (a kind of portuguese gothic) is a unique style larged used by King Manuel I (though created before is kingdom, and used long after is death) whose particularities are the use of very specific themes, all around the big theme \"The Discoveries\", where we can see all the the elements related to the sea ande the boats, However, it pretends to bring a larger message, since we can find also elementos related to de popular tradition, the christian tradition, alchimic elements, anda other icons related to the messianic aspirations of the King Manuel. Is main symbol is the \"Esfera Armilar\" who pretends to be the \"Spera Mundi\".In Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos one can find and admire all these things descrived above, and read the History of Portugal carved in the beautifull stones. The Big Chappel is absolutly amazing and it deserves to get lost inside for a while and search for the details. Also in the huge cloisters one can find many different tracery in each column, in each corner. One og the biggest philosophers im Portugal (Ant\u00f3nio Telmo) says that the Horoscope of Portugal is written in these Walls.It really is one of the Big 5 Monuments you must visit in Lisbon."

From this place, all of Belem tower, Discovery monument, San Franciso replica Bridge and Brazil replica Jesus were visible and presents a beautiful look.

The first, about Alexandro Herculano, an aptly named towering figure of learning, was a fascinating insight into Portugal's 19th Century history.

A great little history display too that puts world, Portuguese and the monastery history on three separate timelines. You can visit the church and cloister and close surrounding rooms - the actual building itself is much larger though didn't investigate if that's ever open to the public.

To visit it is good to come at any time, but if come earlier you can see and live more the history and the stories that surround this huge monument. All the information is provided there. This is part of the Portuguese History."

I would have liked to stay longer to admire the grandeur of the building. The only disappointment was Vasco da Gama's tomb which was so crowded that I could only remain there a brief moment. I visited in the off-season so I hate to think how crowded the place would be in high season. It is certainly an attraction that should not be missed but be prepared to share the beauty with many others."

Lisbon is a beautiful historical city and since we were able to spend 2 weeks we saw many other wonderful places.My personal opinion is that when people are on a limited time schedule they all tend to hit the most popular places.

Since we have been unimpressed with the way other World Heritage sites are run (Pont du Gard, Newgrange), we were unimpressed and started looking for a reason to leave. Suddenly a man came out of the office and closed our line and moved many of us to the end of a much longer line that had already formed. While waiting now in the much longer line, we took a close look at a shorter line to the right. It said Free Entrance to the church. Since this is all we really wanted to do we bailed out of the paying line and went through the free entrance, thus avoiding the whole UNESCO fiasco. On entering the church there were Silence signs everywhere which was funny because there was construction going on within with ear-splitting jackhammers working. We admired the interior of the church, paid our respects to Vasco de Gama and then headed out to see the Marine Museum."

If you remembers it dates from the XVI century, and the majority of the Europeans had never travelled so far, you will understand how amazing some decorations were, and still are. Buy a complete ticket and use 2 or 3 hours to see everything in detail. And after that indulge yourself with a nice meal in Descobre restaurant, nearby (go to the side of Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m, continue in the trams street and it will be on your left side)."

The 4 sites are the Mosterio dos Jeronimos, Berardo Arte Moderna, Torre de Belem and the Discoveries Monument. All four of these attractions are in walking distance from one another. The Tram leaves you off directly across the street from the Mosterio. The entry fee was minor with the Lisboa Card. The structure includes a Church, a Monastery and a wonderful Cloister. The crowds, even early in the morning are pretty overwhelming. My emotional reaction to this building, was subdued, as is the building. It is a high example of Manueline architecture which is a world away from the Gothic architecture of a different era.After walking around the perimeter of the church, make sure to stop in the Cloister, which my wife said is more beautiful than the one in Inwood (Manhattan, NYC). It provides a nice element of quiet and place to be somewhat pensive. The whole time needed here is not be more than 1 hour. Then walk across the street to the Berardo Art museum - a museum and complex that is good as it gets."

We took the bus from Lisbon to Belem on a Sunday morning and arrived in Belem late morning so we didn't expect such a long line to get in. Turns out that alot of tour buses go in the morning. Since we were on our own and flexible with our itinerary, we went to see the Tower of Belem and the Discoveries Monument first. By the time we got back to the monastery a couple hours later, there was no line and fewer crowds at Jeronimos. It is truly worth the price of admission. A cultural gem that is packed with amazing art and history!"

The church adjoining the monastery, Church of Santa Maria de Belem, is a beautiful structure containing the tombs of the famous explorer Vasco da Gama and of Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, considered by many to be Portugal's finest poet. You can expect to see lofty, vaulted arches and lovely stained glass windows. When you tour the monastery, you will be able to access the upper choir area which will allow you a marvelous view of the church's interior from a higher perspective. When you're up there, be sure to note the carved wooden stalls used by the monks. On the day I went (midday on a Tuesday), access to the church was immediate, but I had to wait about 15 minutes to enter the monastery.The monastery is an incredible edifice of repeating arches and scallops and carvings, along with colored tiles. The tan-colored stone seem to have been carved to simulate a filigreed, wedding-cake type of effect. There are also wonderful arched walkways that are open to a courtyard. One room holds an elaborate timeline exhibit which, I regretfully confess, that was interesting but provided far more information that I could process at one time. I did not participate in any sort of tour. I just wandered through the church and monastery at my leisure and tried to immerse myself in imagining the history and religious significance of these buildings. It was a terrific experience."

Disappointingly, there wasn't much to more to see.......except a new exhibition (timeline of the Monastery against world events) which was presented in pictorial and written format (Portuguese and English). Whilst extremely interesting, I picked-up a glaring error in the written detail...'Englishman' James Watt (Engineer) was in fact a 'Scotsman' (born in Greenock, near Glasgow) and as a result I would have to question the factual validity of the information presented.The Cathedral (located alongside the Monastery) was serine and impressively large but not particularly ornate or memorable.All in all, a visit of HUGE disappointment and a waste of valuable (and limited) time, as a tourist in Lisbon."

The monastery holds the Marine Museum and the Museum of Archeology as well as the Monastery and church. The only Sunday entry that is free is the 1st of the month. Yesterday it was a sunny warm day with a breeze and the line wasn't bad. Seniors 1/2 price! Considering these monks did no manual labor these are some impressive buildings. The King's mausoleum being the 1st goal, and having monks pray non stop for him paying for everything is how the thoughts went in those days, buy your way to heaven. The architecture is phenomenal. We spent 3-4 hours inside. The chapter house, only the doors are from the 1500s but the room is awesome. The refectory is filled with tile work showing the feeding of the masses and events of Jesus' life in Egypt, The wall tiles are really colorful. the cloisters, surrounding the courtyard shows how peaceful and reverential an atmosphere the monks lived in, Everything was spectacular, then we entered the upper choir room of the church. What a gorgeous space. The light coming through the stained glass windows streaming into the sanctuary below was breath taking. We went through the church on the way out and it was equally awesome. The chapels along the sides were simple or super ornate. Great visit while in Lisbon."

The south portal and the church (for which entry is free) also has superb manueline carvings with the columns in the church surely being unique. The refrectory is also worth a look, and lastly don't forget to pay your respects at the grave of Vasco da Gama at the entranceway of the church. The monastery as a whole is well worth a visit to Belem but you should of course also consider visiting the Torre de Belem, and the Padro dos Descobrimentos. The maritime museum next to the monastery also seems to be very underestimated; it's an excellent little museum.On a practical note, consider taking a tax. It's not expensive and without the crowding and risk of the number 15 tram - my wife had her wallet pickpocketed the day we went to Belem and it's clearly not an isolated case."

We just returned from a vacation / horse riding lesson vacation in Portugal, with several days based in central Lisbon and on our last full day we went out of the central core area to visit and tour the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - It was a spectacularly wonderful experience!!!We went out on a Sunday late morning - 'went out' mentioned as the site is a fair distance from the central old town core and our original plan was to take the rail tram car (as the prior day we had purchases a one day tram/ bus pass).TIPS: It proved difficult to get an old style) tram at all - let alone one that was not full / packed like sardines. We then walked blocks to a central tram / train area only to have to wait / waste almost an hour and still no tram / train came by that took you to even somewhat close to the site. SO - (advice) - take a cab. it proved to be worth the limited cost for four people, the cab took us right to the front entrance (rather than several blocks away which us where the nearest tram stop was located) and it got us there VERY FAST! A trip by one of the motorized bike 'Tuc Tucs' might also prove very enjoyable - and certainly faster, more direct than the tram system.Also - as far as going on a Sunday morning:TIPS:1. When you arrive, there may be a mass / service as it is Sunday. if you wish to see the main monastery area first - ensure that you are in the correct line. The line up to get into the mass service and / or those waiting to get into the cathedral area first even while there was a mass going on - was blocks long.Go right up to the entrance doorway and take the line that goes into the monastery area 1st - no line-up, no waiting. This gives you the chance to walk and tour the cloister / monastery area 1st - which architecturally stunning, and despite the possible crowds - is a photographers dream location.2. Sunday walk-in access (at least for the time we arrived) was FREE. 3. Also on Sunday...there is a very good flea market / antique market in one area of the parking lot / park area. Many of these vendors were also at the massive Saturday flea market that floods the streets and alleys around the Santa Clara Cathedral in the east end of the historic core.We toured the cloister / monastery area when we first arrived - architecturally world class and awe inspiring, and a photographers dream area... beautifully stunning at every turn... almost ever inch intricately detailed... a historical gem.THEN... thinking that our visit was over... doors opened after the mass service and the public could enter the main cathedral - massive, more awe inspiring, beautiful every where your looked - in every photograph I took.You may not hear much about the Monastery prior to your trip, and may take it for granted as 'just another church'... . but it is well worth the visit. It was actually from the advise and recommendations of several locals and from the instructors an staff at the horse riding school out in the countryside that we attended before venturing into Lisbon for several days that we decided to visit the monastery on our last day rather than several other key historic tourist locations, and the decision was a wonderful choice.Definitely a highlight of the trip, and will be revisited if we ever get back to Lisbon!!!"

Pay attention to the details and you will see the amazing handiwork that went into building the monastery. Every column is carved with a different design and there are a lot of columns. The church was closed as we were there on a Sunday and a service was being held. If you visit the museum (it has a separate entrance) first, you do not have to wait in line at the monastery as you can buy your monastery ticket at the museum and bypass the line. And if you are using the Lisboa Card, the museum is also included so no extra costs to you. The timeline of world history was a great sight also. I wish I would have had that in history class."

You have to wait a very long time to get a ticket, then make your way through the building without stepping on other's feet. The building is fantastic, the sculpture work, the tiles, it's all very beautiful. I imagined we would be able to visit more of it though, the building itself being huge but it houses two other museums so of course the historical visit part is limited. The church is accessible for free and it's very beautiful.In conclusion, visit the monastery if you have the Lisboa card as the visit is then free (but you can't cu the queue).

From the second floor you can enter the high choir loft of the cathedral, well worth the visit.

It would seem more logical to stand on line for something you have already seen and admired.The church and monastery were built 5 centuries ago. Big massive structures with lots of stone carvings.

The style is named for King Manuel I and distinctively references maritime motifs and the discoveries of Vasco da Gama (the first European to reach India by sea) and Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral (the first European to sail to what we now know as Brazil). It celebrates the age when Portugal was a ruler of the seas. The \"cloisters\" was smaller than I imagined, but its stonework was beautifully ornate and the maritime motifs were fascinating. Don't miss visiting the Church of Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m; Vasco de Gama's tomb is here. Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos is in Bel\u00e9m, which has many other attractions worth visiting, such as Torre de Bel\u00e9m, Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos, Museu Nacional dos Coches, Museu Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Berardo, Pasteis de Bel\u00e9m and more.

Everything positive that is said about this place is true - spend some time in the comprehensive historical timeline in the small chapel upstairs - and orient yourself in time (and space) to the sites around you.

The Exterior is Styled with a White Carved Stone Facade that has almost Impossibly fine Detail on almost every Window, Door or Niche. I Went on the First Sunday of the Month when Entry is Free & although there was a lot of Tourists here from Early Morning it took only Fifteen Minutes to gain Entry.  The Tomb of Vasco De Gama lies inside the Adjacent Church but is only Open during certain Hours outside of services so maybe check these times at the Church Entrance First to Ensure you can gain Entry.  The Monastery itself has an Absolutely Stunning Courtyard surrounded on all Four sides with a Cream Stone, highly Ornate Cloister on two levels that makes for a Wonderful Ambience, removing You from the Outside World in to a place of Peace & Tranquility. There is also a Museum here which houses some Great Artifacts of Lisbon & Belem History & is well worth a look. This is an Absolute Must See on your Lisbon Trip that certainly has a Wow Factor."

The journey is simple - it only takes seven minutes by train from Cais de Sodre and there are around three trains an hour. We had to queue outside for some time but this may have been because we arrived at a busy time - if you're on a tight schedule, consider booking the tickets in advance to avoid this. If you do plan on going into the Belem tower (I personally don't think it is worth it), take this opportunity to buy a joint ticket. The monastery has stunning architecture and the visit is rounded out by some very interesting exhibits in English and Portuguese about those the Portuguese icons buried there."

There was no one there so we got some good photos of the front and were able to get into the church before mass. We left to look at another site and came back around 11AM. Wow, suddenly there were a lot of people around and the crowd just got bigger as the day went on. But the clostiers were definitely worth the visit. The restoration work makes of a truly remarkable experience. There is a lot to see here with other exhibits inside. We spent about 2 hours here."

Then you start looking at the carved details in the archway. Then you begin to notice that the carvings in each archway are different. Eventually, you make your way up to the second level and find more details to explore.There is also a display in one of the side rooms, that has a timeline showing history on three tracks stacked above each other: the history of the monastery, the history of Portugal and the history of the world. A good point of reference.The church is also impressive and worth getting into another line for, but it is the monastery that you come to see.You can take one of several buses or the 15E tram to get out there from downtown. We took the train from Cais do Sodre (a train, metro and ferry terminal). Fast and comfortable. Three stops (about 10 minutes) and 2.50 euro R/T. On Sunday, the trains every 20 minutes.

The history that is captured in this monastery is simply amazing. The Moorish influence is evident, travels by ship to far away lands is depicted. Whether one approves of the history or not, history is history and this place depicts it all. I loved the many references to both Africa and India. Lions and elephants all over the place.

In fact the queue moved quite quickly and we were soon in the cool cloisters of this magnificent building. The tiled refectory and the cloister areas are very impressive, but the church, especially when entered from the upper level as we did, is as magnificent as anything I've ever seen. There is also something rather moving about viewing the tomb of Vasco da Gama just a few hundred meters from where he set sail on his daring voyage of discovery. If you like art, architecture and history this building is a must."

Mosteiro dos Jeronimos is an amazing sight, situated in the Belem area close to Lisbon.First things first, if you are travelling here from Lisbon, catch tram number 15 from Praca Figueira, a modern style tram, which accomodates more passengers than those normally seen in the city. Whilst this is very good, it does get caught in the city centre traffic and you may wish to consider catching the train to Belem station from Cais de Sodre instead.The building is a fantastic sight and is a 'must-do' however the queues were a little large and slow moving on our visit. The cost was 10 Euros each, not too bad until you factor in the cost of paying for a full family.The main thing to see as you enter is the cloister, a superb and very decorative sight, but I would imagine best seen when the crowds are a little less busy as it would be better seen 'in the quiet' as it was initially indented for.There is also a church, accessed directly next to the entrance which is free. This includes the tomb of Vasco de Gama and Luis de Camoes.Overall, this is a great piece of history and worthy of a visit, just try to catch it when the crowds don't overpower its beauty."

And from the Belem waterfront, some blocks away, its facade makes a mighty impression. However, in the end was fairly disappointed with our visit, which was spread across three days - maybe that fed into our lessening of appreciation. On day # 1, a Sunday, the monastery was closed for an event though the church was open and free. It was busy though highlight was tomb of Vasco da Gama. That was good.On Monday the monastery is closed so returned Tuesday morning. Even at 9.50 - ten minutes before opening time - there was a depressingly long queue. Despite what appears to an official policy of making entry as inefficient as possible, the queue actually moved reasonably quickly. Ten Euros each to enter and what do you see? A stroll around the cloisters, plus entry to a few other rooms. There is lots of exquisite stone carvings to admire in the cloisters as well some fine 'azulejos' tiles in the refectory. For all that, we were out again in less than an hour. Thought it pretty expensive for what you get."

When I got there, the queue for the Cloister was quite long but the one for the Church wasn't. It was confusing, because I wasn't expecting two different queues, so I got in the one for the Cloister. After probably 20 to 30 mins we approached the front door, but I didn't see the ticket office and some people were getting out of line to go into a little alcove on the left, then came out, showed a slip of paper to someone and got right in. I feared, though, that I was going to get to the entrance and find out I needed to purchase a ticket before I got in line, so I did the same. You don't need to do that. The ticket window was just a little farther in, up some stairs. Don't Panic.If you are going to go to several things in Belem, especially in one day, I suggest getting a Lisboa Card. You can pre-order them (they come in 1,2,and 3 day values) or buy one at either a tourist office or any booth where you see the Lisboa Card (it's purple) displayed, and around a major attraction such as this, it's easy to find one. They are also good for the train from Lisbon to Belem, and all public transit in Lisbon (metro, bus/carris, tram). It gets you into the Monastery free, you get into the Torre de Belem for free, and it gets you discounts other places in Belem, Lisbon, and Sintra.The Cloister is very large, and has two levels, with lots of interesting carving, and great places for photos and selfies. There is huge new display which shows the history of the monastery in connection with world history, a very informative and well done exhibit.There are several other museums and monuments nearby, and lots of places to eat. Plus, a must stop is the Pasteis de Belem for the famous Nata custard treats. There is usually a queue there, too, but there is an awning, and the line goes quite quick. You can get a pre-packaged half-dozen of Natas for just over 6 Euros, a good price for an excellent treat."

And the warm light of the southern sun gives a diffrent feel to the entire experience. Anyhow, I consider that the cloister of the monastery is much better and it's worth the visit.

The long line is to enter the church (free) not the monastery (not free, but cheap). Since everyone was waiting in the church line, we thought the church must be something that we should do. We were pretty upset to finally get into the church after about an hour in line and learn that you can't really even explore all of the church, there is just a small area at the entrance that you can go into. The line was a complete waste of time. We went into the monastery next, and this place was stunning!!! You can also go into the church from the monastery (second floor). You get about as good of a look at the church from the monastery (and not waiting in line) as you do from waiting in line. Unless you are a very, very devout Catholic that really wants to see the relic of the saint in the church, don't waste your time in the church line! I think you can also book tickets online in advance, but we didn't find this necessary since the line was for the church, and not the monastery."

In the region of Belem, the debarkation point on the Tagus River for Prince Henry's expeditions to Africa, India, the Spice islands, Japan, and Brasil, is a great monument to Portugal's Exploration of the World. Prince Henry and his successors devised navigation tools and improved designs for sailing vessels that allowed Portugal to pioneer trade and settlement around the world, which made this small nation the envy of Europe.Sailing the Oceans is dangerous enough today, but in the 16th Century, it was more like space exploration, in that many a sailor never expected to return successfully. It was undertaken by brave adventurers who were strengthened in their resolve by deep faith in God and the afterlife. Before their departure, they would stop at the church of Saint Mary of Bethlehem (BELEM) to make peace with their creator and to pray for the welfare of their immortal souls.They were indeed successful and Portugal became rich beyond anyone's expectations. In gratitude, the monarchy established a 5% tax on the sale of imported pepper and spices, with proceeds used to fund a convent and monastery on the site of the medieval church. Today, the enormous cloister is a museum of the period, but the adjacent church is a a gem of Portuguese Manueline Architecture and is a UNESCO World heritage site, for reasons of beauty and historical importance.The style has a very ornate and emotionally-charged type of Gothic detail and holds the graves of many of the country's most important monarchs and explorers, including Vasco de Gama, the first to lead an expedition around the world.Other sites of note in the region are the Tower of Belem, the Museum of Modern Art, and a more contemporary monument to the Explorers on the harbor.It is accessible by modern trams from downtown Lisbon."

You pay to go into the cloisters, but I've never seen anything like the carving of the marble pillars, ceilings etc.But either go very early or after 3.00pm when most of the large-group tours are yet to arrive or have been and gone."

The card only activates the 24 hour free transportation when you first use the card in the tram or metro so we used it in the afternoon because the card also includes the train to Sintra and so this way we could do Belem today and go to Sintra the next day and back late afternoon all for free.When you are in Belem you must try the nata at pasteis de Belem!!

Also had an informative exhibition linking the history of the place with the history of Portugal and a few smaller exhibitions - worth the entrance on its own.Watch out for the queues - this place is on the tourist trail, but lunchtime onwards seemed better, and the place is vast, so can easily swallow crowds.It's also in Belem on the seaside, which is itself worth the tram trip from the city centre.

There is lots to see in the Belem area of Lisbon, so I highly recommend planning to spend at least a morning or afternoon in that area (possibly a bit longer!). And this is one of the must see places while you are out there.The Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos is made out of limestone (which was quarried nearby, but not the stone I would have chosen so close to the water!) and has the Manueline Style of architecture (Portuguese Late Gothic). As such, it is very ornate and light - particularly on the \"white\" stone.There are two parts to the structure: what I think of as the actual monastery (cloisters, the refectory...) and the church of Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m. The church is free, but you pay a small fee to visit the monastery. So the church is typically full (I've visited multiple times) and people keep forgetting/ignoring the requests to keep silent. It is an active church, so you can attend mass there on Sundays. There is much to see and absorb, so I'd plan on 40min minimum inside the church (though you can go in and out in 15 min if you just want to walk through it).The monastery is much less crowded - and to me immediately peaceful. There are only 2 floor levels, but lots to see (I'd say minimum 2 hours). On my first visit I was lucky enough to catch a children's orchestra playing in the central courtyard - I spent 30 minutes just enjoying that show! But even without the orchestra (my subsequent visits) I just want to linger in that courtyard - particularly on very hot summer days. They have an exhibit titled \"A Place in Time\" in the library of the monastery that shows major events in the monastery's history in parallel to Portugal's history and World history. That alone is worth an hour of your time - and I came away wishing for similar timelines being available when I travel and visit different countries.With other highlights near by (the famous Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m, Bel\u00e9m Tower, the Discoveries Monument...), make sure you go out to that way at least once during your visit to Lisbon."

This slightly spoiled our visit to the church, although we did enjoy visiting to tomb of da Gama. We much preferred the cloister area of the monastery, which is ticketed (\u20ac10 from memory). The cloisters are extremely impressive, having been cleaned and restored quite recently. They are on two levels - an unusual feature.The cloister area features a couple of exhibitions, as well as visits into side rooms and onto a viewing gallery over the church.

However, the place right in front of the building is not so nice since it is full of large busses, cars etc (so taking a picture from the park in feont of it is quite a challenge). Also, the entrance fee is really expensive (unless you have a Lisbon card, I would not recommend buying the ticket to go inside). Then, aim for the Torre de Belem and walk back on the riverside to enjoy some tranquility (if you are lucky, you can even hear the bridge sound when you get close to it on a windy day)."

It wasn't very crowded inside - we wondered why there was such a wait to get in. The stonework in the cloister is amazing, it's so detailed and ornate - the stone seems like lace. The refectory with its tiled walls is very impressive. There are two levels of the cloister to visit, plus some additional rooms. You can look down from the upper choir into the body of the church, a fascinating perspective. I am interested in history, and found the information a bit basic and sparse, but this is true of most historical sites in Portugal. There was a room with a display giving more detail, but it was upstairs at the end of the visit."

You can also climb to the second floor from which you can look down into the square-shaped cloister and see it from the top. We bought a ticket that included the visit of Belem tower too, which is not far from the cloister.

It's gorgeous and there is so much detail you could spend an hour or more finding all the little nuances. Dozens of folks take pictures of themselves in the open air middle section, but you can still get fantastic pictures of all of the facades nonetheless.It looks even more beautiful from the park across the street.I think of this as a must-see part of Lisbon.

The sullen ticket vendor didn't tell us about the audio guides which you could have for free though and there isn't much in the way of useful historical information in any of the rooms or courtyard so we pretty much were left to our own devices which cut our visit short.

There are also a few more attractions around, so the ride is worth it if you're in groups of 3-4, as opposed to paying for the tramlines.The Church visit portion is Free. It'll take you approximately 45 minutes to really take in the Manueline Gothic architecture of the church. The style is quite something to behold and the staff do allow plenty of picture taking...BUT it is a church, so tourists are sometimes \"shushed\". The outside \"south portal\" is incredibly detailed, and on a hot day I would recommend refueling on your water while making out the intricate workmanship.This is a great attraction for those that want to keep striking those UNESCO heritage sites of your bucket list!"

It is fantastic place, due to the architecture, you visit to Lisbon would not be full without itBut to avoid queueing I greatly recommend to buy the tickets online in advance, it will save you lots of time as the queue is enormous.And it is better to come at opening time to avoid crowdsEnjoy!"

All of the monasteries and convents in Portugal were secularized in the 19th century and they have all become museums or hotels but abandoned by the religious orders who once lived there. This is a museum but still looks and feels like a monastery. Some beautiful artwork and architecture can be found. It is popular so you also find crowds. Our visit was included as part of a tour so no idea what the entrance fee was but there is a fee. If you are in the are it is worth a visit and the custard tarts found nearby are not to be missed."

We chose the Jeronimos and Torre ticket then paid the extra 6 Euros for the Coach Museum which is all we managed to do in a day. This was with a bench break for a picnic lunch and then a coffee break. Jeronimos is a most beautiful example of the Manueline architecture. Take advantage of the free audio info which was interesting although not arranged in any specific sequence. Put in the number at each major stop. Take your time, walk around the whole site and visit the church, which is free if you do not have time to see the inside of the monastery...although the point of visiting is to see the Manueline architecture. Not sure if you can buy tickets on line. We chatted with some folks in the line up who said that the Sunday free time has horrendous line ups so do not bother waiting for that."

We went by taxi to the Tower of Belem first and then walked back to the monastery along the riverfront, but if pressed for time, I would skip the tower and go straight to the monastery, which is much more interesting.

We didn't see the library (I assume it was closed) and they closed off the cathedral balcony for the service. If you can afford it, give them the money to support the place but don't expect too much, I thought it was the worst value of our entire trip.

The architecture is excellent, as are the stained glass windows, and internal designs. This 16th Century monastery celebrates the great Portuguese explorers and attached to one end of the building is the very good Maritime Museum and extension.The surrounding area is worth visiting too."

Although the mosteiro seems very large, you only get to visit a small part.When you guy your ticket, you can buy a combo of the Mosteiro and the Torre de Belem. When you do, you skip the line at the other attraction. We did the mistake of going to Belem first (which can only take up to 150 people in its tower), so we waited for quite a while at the Tower. Going to the Mosteiro first, we would have skipped the line at the Tower. There are more people that can go into the cloister, so less wait.The entry to the 'tourist' part is in the middle on the site, do not try to enter at the front or back!When you go, you visit the Church (normally free) and the cloister. Both are beautifully decorated. It is so impressive to see the attention to details of the monks that crafted the Mosteiro in manuelline style. It is beautiful and so impressive.1 hour to one hour and a half if you're not an expert in architecture."

Worth seeing when you're in Lisbon, it is a very pretty building with beautiful arches, each one ornately decorated.You can also access a good viewing platform of the church from the Mosteiro (on the left when you go up the stairs to the second level). The church itself is free to enter.There is a good exhibition on the history of Portugal, which is quite lengthy to read, but if you have time it is a great overview on the history of Portugal.Entrance was 10 euro or 12 euro combined with the Torre De Belem. (you can buy the combined ticket at either site - whichever you visit first.) When we arrived around lunch time there was a small queue to get into the church (around 80 people) and around 20 people queued for the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos ticket line. (note there are 3 lines right next to each other, the ticket office is the middle line)Afterwards we walked across the road (use the underpass under the road) to see Padrao dos Descobrimentos. You can easily walk from there to the Torre De Belem. Also right near the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos is the Contemporary Art Museum (free entrance) and is worth a stop.There was plenty of parking around - we parked a few minutes walk away on the street and it was free. There was also a paid parking garage just opposite where the buses park. If you turn right just after the bus carpark there is lots of on street parking. There was also lots of parking around the Padrao dos Descobrimentos - which is on the opposite side of the street.If you're not driving take the #15 tram to get here.We also saw lots of people walking along the river to the sites in Belem, so that's another option if you like walking as it is pleasant along the water. But it would be at least 5 kilometres from the center, possibly more."

I got to the church before 10. No queues. I enjoyed the church, stopping for a quiet prayer and a reflective moment before the bus loads of tourists descend. Sure enough, by the time I was really to leave, the masses were arriving. I could hear the guides talking from a distance as if they were tone deaf, so off putting. I wish they wouldn't do that. I wasn't bothered with paying an entrance fee to see anymore. I've seen a lot of churches and monasteries in my time. Beautiful building and an opportunity to take some lovely pictures outside."

It's great that you can wander freely around both levels of the cloisters and they really are spectacular.

The gothic, Maunline church was breathtaking. The colors from the stain glass windows sparkled all over the carved pillars and vaulted ceiling. The Vasco de Gama tomb was lovely as well as the cloisters. If you like to visit churches in Europe this monastery dies not disappoint. Cross the street to the park and watch the fountain make the monastery sparkle. We walked to the Discovers Monument and Belem monument nearby on the waterfront within 30 minutes round trip. My teen daughters favorite part of a three day trip to Lisbon."

In the west of Lisbon (Belem area) are many important sites (we don't take the paid tours): Mosteiro dos Jeronimos, an UNESCO World Heritage site, is a monastery reflecting Portugal's exploration of the world and housing the tomb of Vasco da Gama who made it to India unlike Columbus. This is the best example of Manueline style of architecture; a sea related maritime elements or moldings resembling corals, carvings covered with sea weeds and algae, elements in ships as anchors, stone ropes and cables and instruments used for navigation. Another example of Manueline architecture along the Tejo River is Torre de Belem where da Gama embarked on his voyage to India in 1497 and where Columbus was forced ashore in a storm on his way back from his discovery of the Americas in 1493. Nearby along the river is the much photographed Monument to the Discoveries built in 1960, a 17ft tall stone carved as a ship's prow with explorers climbing to the top. It commemorates the starting point of many voyages of the explorers. You will find many good restaurants along the West waterfront within view of a red suspension bridge reminding many of the \"Golden Gate Bridge.\"  In the east of Lisbon near the waterfront is a real gem, the Museu Nacional do Azulejo, the ceramic tile (azulejo) museum, located in a beautiful 16th century convent with a collection of 7000 tiles. Though the art of making tiles is a Moorish inheritance, Islamic art forms did not use figurative motifs, only depicted plants or abstract designs, rarely animals. There is a 75ft. panel of blue tiles, removed from a palace, depicting Lisbon's waterfront.in about 1740 before the great earthquake of 1755, destroying much of the city center.  Our hotel was in the north of the city and within walking distance of a museum we really enjoyed, the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian and one of the top ten attractions advertised. They were right. It is a small private collection of oil millionaire Armenian by the same name, but filled with choice quality of artifacts and antiques spanning 4000 years of art history, including a large Lalique collection. We don't often spend as much time in museums but we did enjoy these. The city's centerpiece is Castelo de Sao Jorge, considered the founding settlement in the 6th century BC from archeological finds! Being very old not much to see, except wonderful views of the city and on a hot day a respite under the shady trees (may want a taxi to get there). Lisbon is on 2 hills and with cobbled (flatter stones than rounded) streets. It is not an easy city to walk but the trolleys, some old wooden ones, and the old designer elevators (oldest built in 1884) help you navigate the hills. The subway (Metro) is very good and safe. We didn't worry whether we were in one or more of the city's divisions: Bairro Alto, Chiado, Baixa, or Alfama. Unless you want to spend time shopping or night-clubing.  The Portuguese are more laid back, calmer less dramatic than the Spanish. Their music, \"Fado,\" is a melancholy pining for lost seafarers or their loved ones. Even a museum for this music. The food to us seemed more varied than the Spanish. They share \"Bacalhau\" dishes but the sardines of Portugal are superb not to mention the wines. You can eat hundreds of the tiny clams in garlic oil at one sitting. Have you heard of Nando's restaurant chain in US and UK that serves a piri-piri (a very hot African chlli) chicken? Portuguese southern cities can rival any southern Spanish city so don't be shy about venturing to Europe's farthest west country that is reasonably priced. Read Frances Mayes' (Under the Tuscan Sun author) account of her visit to Lisbon in her book, A Year in the World:Journeys of a Passionate Traveler, to get a wonderful feel for Lisbon and her recommendations."

However, a visit to the cathedral is worth it to see the tombs of many famous Portuguese figures. This includes the tomb of Vasco da Gama.The Maritime Museum is also housed in part of the monastery buildings. That is well worth the 6 euro entrance fee."

Entry to the church is free but it is worth paying to visit the cloisters. This building is an example of the ornate Manueline style of architecture, with beautiful vaulting and carved pillars. It was built in fulfilment of a vow regarding the safe return of Vasca do Gama from India and the explorer, together with Portugal's epic poet Camoes, is buried in the church. I agree with the previous reviewer who recommended the Lisboa Card, which offers free travel on trams, buses on metro and free or reduced entry to many museums and monuments."

It is such a beautiful chapel to begin with and it is such a gorgeous chapel to just sit and enjoy it. Once done, check out the cloisters and you will not be sorry. It is amazing that such a world treasure is still standing and I can see why this place is considered a UNESCO world heritage site. Amazing. I will come back.On a side note, visitors to Lisbon I recommend getting the Lisboa card either from the airport upon arrival or within certain spots in the city. My wife and I got the card which offers either free entry or reduced entry at many museums, sites etc. within 24 hours of being in Lisbon, my wife and I had already made back our 63 euros we paid for the two day pass that very day. Included with the card is:Free entry to all trams, metro, buses, suburban rail etcFree entry to this very monastery in this reviewFree entry to Belem towerIn closing, with one full day left with our passes we have already saved 65 dollars so it has been worth every penny.

I highly reccomend skipping the line for the tram from the center of the city and spending the few euros on the taxi; instead of waiting in a massive line, you're there in 10 min and it costs you less than $10. Live a little. The monastery is, well, a monastery. It is beautiful and the hisotry of it quite neat, but you don't need more than an hour or two to take it in. The interior garden is pleasant to relax in as well. All told, it was a good choice to kill some time and start out vacation. Don't worry too much about the long line, it does move quickly, we were inside within 30 minutes and there was a massive line almost to the end of the monastery when we got there."

            "review": "Stunning! Maybe overpriced?. Moasterio dos Jeronimos is simply beautiful! The architectural style is unlike any other I've seen and the monastery is often reffered to as an example of portuguese 'late gothic Manueline style'. The church of the monastery was perhaps my favorite part of this attraction; it is huge on the inside and absolutely stunning despite the contrast it makes with the exterior facade! The stained glass decorating the church is also very beautiful. It is one of those places that makes you feel so small. Entering the church is completely free.The monastery itself is gorgeous as well, particularly when the sun is starting to set. The inside is quite beautiful as well although the areas you have acces to are actually few and thus, the ticket to the interior might seem a bit overpriced. If you are on a lower budget, going inside the monastery itself might not be worth the expense as the outside facade gives you a great idea of what's inside.Despite this, I would pay again to visit the interior because of the intricate details this style of architecture holds."

Where - Belem, tram #15, get on at Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio (Commercial Plaza) or Praca do Figuera Plaza (Figuera Plaza). It's 40-50 minute ride depending on traffic and get off at Jeronimo Monastery stopWhat- good for single hit, jam-packed visit to a Unesco site plus two museums. Fees can add up but all museums FREE on Sundays to 2pm; and cheap if you buy Lisboa card (multi-use museum, transport usage and discount) or combo tix. In one cluster - the lovely Church of Santa Maria (free), right next to imposing Jeronimo's Monastery (10 euro); and shares entryway to National Archaeology Museum. It's only 5 minute walk to entryway of Maritime Museum (5 euro) on same side of street, further west. First, the church - The Santa Maria is a single-vaulted church with lovely proportioned, slender 25m-tall pillars and gorgeous ribbed ceiling (hurt my neck from looking up an hour!) that from the far end from the chapel, it's one of the prettiest, soaring, airiest I've seen even compared to Roman churches. It's also cool that, in the lower choir, sits stone tomb of explorer/navigator Vasco da Gama (1468\u20131523) with his actual remains. Right beside church is entrance to Monastery (fees for this alone it seems pricey at Adults: \u20ac7Children: \u20ac3.50) - it's an imposing but empty structure. If not interested in architecture might take just 10 minutes to look around the 2-story square cloister, decoratively carved out of limestone and glowing pale yellow in the sun with rows of decorated arches, centered around a plain courtyard with a nondescript fountain. I guess monks were there to contemplate, not glorify. The cloister hallways are lovely with lovely ribbed and vaulted ceilings above, and the decorated open archways to one side. Wish they had hooded figures wandering round- too cheesy? - but what I mean is there should've been exhibit and some interactive display of who, how, what of the monk's lives cos there was NOTHING.The Maritime Museum was large, comprehensive and really interesting with detailed miniatures of shipping and naval vessels from the country's heyday as a seafaring superpower to WWII submarines, intricate sailor's knots, magnificent (if erroneous) globes from the 16th century, armor and dress through the centuries. There's a decent coffeeshop between the twin buildings housing the museum, with usual pastries, snacks if your kids get hungry or for your shot of coffee.Tip - Avoid public tram on rush hours as locals use for getting to and from school/work. It's narrow with few seats. Watch out for pickpockets! Museums very crowded Sundays as free.Tip 2- Lots of decent priced hop-on-off tour options if you dont want to tangle with local crush.(e.g. http://www.viator.com/tours/Lisbon/Lisbon-Hop-On-Hop-Off-Tour-48-hour-Ticket/d538-5391LISBEST3)Details - Please double check opening times. Note - there are discounts on multi-museum visits, in addition to option of discounts on the useful Lisboa card.Archaeological Museum, Pra\u00e7a do Imp\u00e9rioAdults: \u20ac5, Children: \u20ac2.50Open - 10am-6pm Tuesday-Sunday (closed Monday)Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, Pra\u00e7a do Imp\u00e9rioOpen - May 1-September 30 -10am-6pm Tuesday-Sunday (closed Monday); October 1-April 3010am-5pm Tuesday-Sunday (closed Monday)Adults: \u20ac7, Children: \u20ac3.50Maritime Museum, Pra\u00e7a do Imp\u00e9rioAdults: \u20ac5 Children: \u20ac2.50Open - May 1-September 30 -10am-6pm Tuesday-Sunday (closed Monday); October 1-April 3010am-5pm Tuesday-Sunday (closed Monday)"

This Monastery is actually a much larger complex, from which there was carved out space for the Museum of Archaeology, as well as for the Maritime Museum. So what is presented as Monastery of Jer\u00f3nimos is in fact only the large cloister of it plus few adjacent rooms. The architecture, in Gothic style, is fantastic. One of the rooms contains some interesting tiling work - azulejos, so specific to Portugal. Also from here, there is access available to the choir of the Church itself (and which has its own entrance, free of charge). When I reached there one morning, there were people already in the line, even though it was almost an hour left till the opening. As it seems with the majority of such sights and museums in Portugal, the opening time was 10 AM, which I think would have been more useful from a tourist's point of view, if it was a bit earlier. The entrance fee I thought was a bit high, so one might consider getting a combined ticket with some of the other attractions mentioned above (the Museum of Archaeology, specifically) and others, within the same Monastery complex or nearby."

It's an amazing building that I suggest you to visit if you visit Lisbon, for exemple after visiting the Belem's Tower. It is famous for its architecture and for being the place where a lot of portugueses kings were burried (Including Manuel the first himself). Manuel the first used his own architectural style to build this unique monastery. This monastery has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage in 1983."

Not to be missed is the refectory, where the monks ate, and the quadrangle (which was actual a slight octagon because the corners were clipped) with it's incredible feel, and intricate, well preserved stone carvings.

I found it very peaceful (not surprising, as it is/was a monastery), but also fascinating in terms of its architecture. The building is quite impressive from the outside and may deceive one into thinking it's not necessary to enter - but the interiors are another matter unto themselves. Walking around, you can see a few playful elements mixed in, such as woodland animals. It's much more than your usual leaves and flowers carved onto pillars. The Jeronimos Monastery is one of the few surviving Manueline buildings in Europe, and because of its uniqueness, it's a must-see. There is also access to the balcony, so you get a bird's-eye view of the attached church.If you're more interested in churches and not that interested in architecture, you could skip it. The exhibits inside were kind of boring and I didn't spend much time on them. But it's money well spent just to see the building itself.

We intended to take the 15 tram to Belem, but there was a marathon on that day so after waiting for 30 mins we took a taxi instead splitting with another couple (only total 10 Euros). We were dropped outside the monastery and just standing outside it is amazing. The beautiful architecture combined with its size make it something you need to see when in Lisbon, even if just from the outside.We visited the church first (free of charge to the right) - bring a cover for your shoulders. Then we waited in the queue for the Monastery which we thought would be free it being a Sunday....but its only free the first Sunday of the month. The ticket booths are extremely slow so expect a wait - and buy a combo ticket for the fortress at the same time as that enables you to avoid the queues there - you can just waltz straight through.If you can - visit this - its a must!"

Visiting is a must and should never be missed while in Lisbon. Its construction, commanded by Portuguese King D. Manuel I, started between the 15th and the 16th centuries, right after navigator Vasco da Gama's return from his iconic voyage to India. It would not be wrong to mention that this magnificent Monastery, in the lovely manueline gothic style, celebrates the grandiosity of the Portuguese discoveries, as well the huge profits obtained from the spice trade. Inside \"Mosteiro dos Jer\u00f3nimos\", many of the Portuguese heroes and artists are buried: King D. Manuel I, Navigator Vasco da Gama and Poets/Writers Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, Alexandre Herculano and Fernando Pessoa, and many others. \"Jer\u00f3nimos\" is a Portuguese National Monument since 1907 and has been appointed by Unesco, in 1983, as a World Heritage. The entrance to the Monastery is free, but admissions to Sacristy and Cloisters are charged. I would skip the Sacristy (that you can admire from a certain distance), but the Cloisters are definitely a must see! Combine the visit with other nearby mythical monuments: \"Torre de Bel\u00e9m\", \"Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos\" and the \"Museu Nacional dos Coches\". A quick stop at the \"Casa dos Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m\" will be your opportunity to taste the unforgettable Portuguese National pastry: the delicious \"Past\u00e9is de Nata\"! Enjoy!"

However, the cloisters are the more beautiful of the two buildings open to visitors.When we arrived there were very long lines and no clear instructions. One trick we learned was that you can buy tickets for all of the Belem attractions at the archeology museum next door to the Monastery. There were only a few people in line and we bought tickets without much of a wait. We did not have to buy for the museum - we just bought the monastery and the tower. With a ticket, we were able to head to the front of the one line at the front of the monstery (and the tower of belem as well later in the day)."

            "review": "Gorgeous Architecture! But that Line was Awful.... After waiting in line in the rain to visit the Bel\u00e9m Tower, I was not feeling up for getting drenched again waiting in line. When mass let out in the main church, my curiosity led me over to take a peek. Other people were going in and there was no line and it was inside, so why not? I'm glad I did, because it was gorgeous. When they say Manueline is a unique style, I thought \"No it's not. It's just Gothic.\" Yes, it still feels Gothic, but it has a completely different feel to it. It's much more intricate and detailed, with more nature motifs. Plants, animals and vegetables (many from the new world) are nestled into nautical and marine elements, such as strings of stone rope or shells. Oh, and Vasco de Gama was buried over in the corner!After enjoying the church so much, I decided to brave the line and the rain on my second to last day in Lisbon. I refused to buy one of the overpriced umbrellas from one of the vendors around the monastery. Instead I struck up a conversation with a fellow traveler who already had an umbrella.Once inside, the sun came out and cast a beautiful golden light onto the intricately-carved honey colored cloisters of the monastery's inner courtyard. The space was much smaller than I imagined; it only takes a few minutes to walk around one of the two levels. But the dancing arches, spires and balconies entranced me into staying for much longer, like one of the monks who must have come here to study centuries ago.Perhaps I'm just crazy for architecture, but I do not regret waiting in line to get in. However, I would recommend any non-architecture buffs to either come early or late in the day, when lines tend to be shorter. If you do plan on coming mid-day, check the weather first. Bel\u00e9m is quite far from the city center and lines provide zero refuge from inclement weather. Nearby restaurants tend to be small and will fill up quickly when it starts to pour."

There was only a handful of people inside so we managed to take our time to view & take photos of the monastery. The interior was unique & if you look closely you will see many different animals or faces carved into the pillars & columns. You can even access to the second storey via the staircase. Upstairs, there is even a door that leads you inside the church. You can view the interior of the church from 2nd floor and see Jesus on the cross. We were surprised that the actual space opened to visitors was actually pretty small. In fact, one can finish viewing the 1st & 2nd floor in less than half an hour if they are quick. But as it was listed as a Unesco World Heritage site, we wanted to visit it.Though closing time was 6pm, the staff gave us some allowance & closed the monastery at 6.10pm. Admission fee costs 10 euros per person. Opening hours was 10am - 6pm in July 2014.The adjoining church was free to visit. There was no queue there. The church entrance was just beside the entrance to the Jeronimos Monastery. Inside, you will find the chapel and the tombs of famous explorer Vasco da Gama & King Manuel & other Portuguese royalties. To reach Jeronimos Monastery, we took the metro to Cais do Sodre. Outside Cais do Sodre metro station, look for the tram stop with tram number 15E. Take tram 15E to Belem. The tram ride takes around 15 minutes. Alight immediately after you see the famous Pasteis de Belem pastry shop selling custard tarts. The tram 15E will stop just a few steps away from Jeronimos Monastery. Hope this helps"

Still we had to queue for probably half an hour in the blazing sun (although we took it in turns to photograph the outside of the monastery, including the intricate stonework around the door to the adjoining church). But of all the attractions in Lisbon this one is the most worth the effort. It is simply astounding, breathtaking, amazing. Even on my second visit I got chills looking at the ornate, detailed stonework. If you're not into architectural beauty it is probably quite a dull, short visit, but if you appreciate being able to see up close the kind of talented masonry work that normally adorns cathedrals dozens of metres up in the air, it is the most incredible visit. We were also fortunate to see a wedding taking place in the adjoining church (the monastery has access to the 'gallery' - I'm sure it has a proper churchy name - overlooking the main body of the church). This remains my favourite attraction in Lisbon by a mile."

However, all three are within a stone's throw of each other, and all three are in the Lisbon suburb of Belem. Took me a while to find this review site. ;-)Jeronimos Monastery - a stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site! I love the place and visit it every time I'm in Lisbon.Looks as if some of the other reviewers have had problems with lengthy queues. (Had the same problem myself at Versailles and ended up leaving almost immediately after I'd arrived.)With Jeronimos, I guess I've been very lucky because any time I've been there, there have been no queues at all!If you're on an organised tour, then expect massive queues. Most tour buses descend on a site at the same time: between 10 and 10:30 a.m. If you're a solo traveller, then you have a definite advantage. You can arrive much earlier - while tour groups are still having breakfast - and have a truly enjoyable visit, virtually free of frustration.Opening hours for visitors officially start at 10:00 a.m., but I've never had any problem getting in earlier.It IS a functioning church, so best to check hours of service prior to visiting. Better to wait until there are no services in progress, as it's much easier to wander around and take pictures then.Another reviewer mentions 'entrance fee'. To my knowledge, there is no entrance fee to the church.However, there IS an entrance fee to the adjacent National Archaeological Museum (and to the Maritime Museum next to it).A possible problem for visitors is that the entrance to the church and the entrance to the archaeological museum are very, very close to each other. So, it's very easy to end up in the 'wrong' place.Still another reviewer says there is no photography allowed. Unless this is a VERY new rule, photography certainly IS allowed, although it's probably more respectful to refrain from taking pictures while there's a service in progress.Any time I've ever visited the monastery, the clicking of cameras - including my own - is very audible, along with the whispered 'ohs and aws' of people amazed by the staggering beauty of the interior.It really is worth the time and effort to visit this magnificent church!"

Over time, silt filled up the area and now there is a big street, (Avenida da India) and little park strips and harbor openings where the edge of the water was.Most impressive as a resting place for Vasco de Gama and a famous poet Camoes, who, Portugese natives say they were forced to memorize and interpret in school. Probably not too unlike modern-day Americans trying to read old-English \"Canterbury Tales\" without Cliff Notes. We did notice that our tour guide (Portugese) did wince when remembering the poet's legacy and the role it played in her Portugese education.The tombs are pretty fantastic, intricately carved focal points inside the church. The travels of Vasco de Gama furthered Portugese explorations and the church has many symbols in honor of these accomplishments. The central column/supports resemble palm tree trunks, with their branches or ribs flowing out from there. There are even elephants represented here, all giving that \"nod\" to Vasco de Gama's Eastern travels. Look around for the Eastern-influences, they are there. Kings and queens are also entombed here, like a mausoleum.Construction began in about 1502, Vasco de Gama lived from 1468-1523. The poet was born 2 years afer Vaso de Gama's death and he is said to have been a writer of Vasco's travels."

Finally, after at least an hour and a half we paid our 7 euros per person and went in expecting to see a lot of really nice things. What we saw was a courtyard and the above view of the church. Nothing worth waiting even 15 minutes for. The church was very nice and when we exited the monastery we discovered that we could have walked directly to the church with no line and IT'S FREE! So the only thing worth seeing was free and there was no line. WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY TELL US? An employee at the monastery should have announced this. I am also disappointed that no Trip Advisor writer told us this. If you go to Belem see the church for free but do not wait in the line and pay a very overpriced 7 euros to see the courtyard. Better yet, don't go to Belem unless you have some extra time in Lisbon (the Belem tower wasn't that great either). I absolutely love Lisbon, Sintra, and Cascais.

The Monastery of Jeronimos was the first port of call. What an absolute treat! The architecture is superb, built by Henry the Navigator in the 16th as a celebration of the Portuguese Sailors achievements, and is home to the tombs of Vasco da Gama and Camoes. The entrance price was included in our trip, but I believe it is free to enter before 14:00 on a Sunday. So, if you are staying in Lisbon, or have the opportunity to visit as we did, do visit this wonderful Unesco site for a memory that will linger long after many others have faded."

You'll probably be frustrated that you can't fit it all into one decent photograph, it's so massive! If you are going to Belem from central Lisbon at the weekend and you didn't get up early enough like us, I advise not to attempt to get the bus (no 15 from outside the metro station) the queues are crazy long and chaotic. You may as well get the train it is only 3 euros and it's quicker, no queues and more comfortable I can imagine. If you arrive in the afternoon, wander around the park, see the towers, have some cake first and wait for the queue to go inside to die down. We only had to wait until about half three and the queue was much, much shorter."

This late Gothic building has an airy feeling; Manueline symbols and elements cover the limited columns in the aisles and naves, producing an airy and open interior. Walk along the exterior walls and you'll pass tombs of both Portuguese and Austrian royalty. The tomb of Portugal's famed navigator Vasco da Gama also lies within the Church.

We then went upstairs where we were in part of the church and the upper tier of the courtyard where we could look down at this stunning haven. If you are in the area it is well worth the visit just to have your breath taken away if nothing else."

It sprawls over an entire block and unlike most buildings, religious and otherwise, is actually in pretty decent shape.... not perfect but very good. As you would expect the cathedral part is quite cavernous but it is the cloisters that are most impressive. When you see the majesty of the place combined with the treasures inside you can just imagine how the church bled the people to finance such extravagance. All over Lisbon you see homeless people begging and sleeping in the streets but the churches lie empty at night."

If you have more than one day in Lisbon, I'd recommend you to take the train to Belem and spend a day walking around seeing the beautiful sites along the waterside. The main attraction is Mosteiro dos Jeronimos. There is not an awful lot to see inside, but what makes it so attractive is the building style (Manueline style). It is a typical Portuguese style (you won't see it anywhere else) and this monastery gives you a really clear idea about what Manueline style is. It is a very peaceful place and once you've seen it, you must walk down the road to Pasteis de Belem for Lisbon's best Pastel de Nata (we got the tip from a local Lisbonese, and it is well worth taking. It is cheap, old setting with plenty of room in the back and, honestly, the best Pastel de Nata in Lisbon). For us Mosteiro dos Jeronimos and surroundings were one of the best experiences in Lisbon, so highly recommend you to go."

We had purchased the useful Lisboa Card by virtue of which all public transport rides were free as also the entry to famous attractions such as Jeronimos Monastery, Belem Tower & Santa Justa Elevator.The comfortable journey took us about 40 minutes to reach the monastery.The Jeronimos Monastery is possibly Portugal's most historical monument located in Belem along the river Tagus. The monastery has an opulent church and cloistered garden built in the elegant Manuelian style in addition to the monastery quarters built in the beginning of the 16th century when Portugal was a great sea-going power. There are several sights in close proximity such as the Archaeological Museum located in the same premises in adition to the emblematic Belem Tower and the Monument of Discoveris located within walking distance. The setting of this historic monastery is quite scenic due the overlooking beautiful Praca de Imperio.This monastery will definitely feature in must do list when visiting Lisbon."

On entering the monastery we immediately realised what all the fuss was for.This beautiful gothic revival example was packed with architectural gems, from the ancient cloisters to the intricate carving. The exterior of the building is beautiful but its interior takes your breath away. You can buy gifts at the shop or go to the church attached if you want a more religious feel. Mass was going on so be aware there are restrictions on Sundays. Avoid the crowds and go early , but be careful if the market opposite is open as pickpockets operate there.Overall I am overwhelmed that I finally got to see one of Lisbon's crown jewels.

King Manuel 1 financed this beautiful structure with \"pepper money\", a tax levied on spices, precious stones and gold brought back from trade with Africa and the Orient.There are a number of outstanding areas. The Main Chapel is an excellent example of Mannerist art which is a contrast to the Church's Manueline main structure. Several of the tombs (including Manuel 1) are supported by elephants. The spectacular vaulting in the church nave is held aloft by slender octagonal pillars that rise like palm trees to the roof. One of our favourite areas is the High Choir complete with pictures of the Apostles and the Image of Christ on the Cross in painted wood. Another featured area is the Cloister, a peaceful place for St. Jerome's monks to pray and meditate. This is probably the most significant example of Manueline style architecture. The arches and balustrades are covered in delicate tracery and richly carved religious and royal symbols. Well worth a few hours tour. Can be combined with the Tower of Belem and The Monument to the Discoveries when in Belem. All are free entry with the Lisboa Card."

Wonderful place to visit.Across the park from the monastery is the Belem Tower, also part of this World Heritage Site. It is now on the bank of the Tagus River but was originally built as a fort in the middle of the river.

No two sections of the cloister were alike, each was unique and spellbinding at that.By contrast, the front half of the church was dark, and it was very hard to take a good picture there, even for my camera, which usually does very well in low light.

One thing I always find when visiting ancient cities in Europe is that despite the beauty and opulence of the churches you eventually get 'burnt out' on them after seeing too many in too short a time. If there is one church that you see when in Lisbon though, make it this one. It is quite simply breathtaking, beautiful architecture abounds. You feel in awe simply walking around.Pro-tip: if you do decide to visit be sure to purchase a LISBOA card from tourist information...the card not only gives you free admission to the monastery (and Torre de Belem incidentally) but free public transport to get you to and from Belem"

The architecture is manueline architecture, a style which has gothic, moorish and renaissance influence. The monastery contains the tombs of Vasco de Gama, King Manuel and other Portuguese royalty. Very impressive. Don't miss the Tower of Belem and the Monument of Discovery which are also in the same area."

The monastery, today a museum, is above all else, a wonderful piece of architecture, encompassing history within it's several styles, because it took a long while to build: from the Gothic to the Renaissance, and the very specific Portuguese renaissance style, the 'Manuelino' thus called as a tribute to the King of its period, Manuel I (1469-1521) who reigned between 1495-1521, the Monastery contains the tombs of Portugal's Poet Laureate Cam\u00f5es, Portugal's Vasco da Gama, discoverer of the maritime way to India, and of Fernando Pessoa, Portugal's most famous modern poet, who died in 1935. The cloisters, the church, the gardens, they all provide a most wonderful visit and souvenir!"

The church is very beautiful, we stayed for sung Mass , enjoying the service, choir and organ music. this was perhaps the highlight of our tour.Next venture into the archaeological museum next door, a wealth of interesting and beautiful artefacts.

It is rightly so.The Mosteiro dos Jeronimos is the architectural representatives of a period in which the Portugal had a leading role in expanding the horizons of both Europe and the world. It was situated symbolically in Belem (Betlehem), which, in the 16th century, was the site of the port from which the caravelas and other large ships set sail on the great discovery voyagesThe monastery was commissioned by D. Manuel I. The magnificence of the building reflects the universalist vision of its founder and the powerful financial resources that the Portuguese crown then enjoyed.To see such a magnificent building you need time and space, and most tours do not provide you with any of that. The place was so crowded that you couldn't see anything properly, let alone feel the age and appreciate the beauty of the cloister. I advise you to go there by yourself and to choose the time of the day carefully. Belem, unfortunately, is not connected with the city by Metro, but take a taxi (not expensive) and enjoy the Belem monuments without the tourist crush."

Once you reach Bel\u00e9m with Tram no.15 (first station is Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio and you will leave the tram at Bel\u00e9m, simply follow the crowd) combine your trip with Torre de Bel\u00e9m, Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries) and Museu dos Coches (Coaches Museum). If you have a tight budget, from 10:00 am till 14:00 all the monuments are free on sundays. These four must-see attractions are really close and can be easily discoved on foot. One more practical budget advice is to buy a day ticket just for 5\u20ac (5.5\u20ac if you do not have a card) from one of the metro stations which is valid for 24h after the first usage, the trams are even more expensive if you pay inside (2.85\u20ac just for one way)."

There is a room which houses master piece paintings. There was a 1 euro entry fee but when I was there, the collections of arts were admired and studied by many art students. I was not planning to visit cloister but, I am glad that I did (7 euros). Arches all around and each are curved and so detailed. The sculptures on the second floor have some damages to them but, look very carefully, there are different animals and creatures(pig, glass hopper etc). You can access the second floor of the church from the cloister and look straight to alter. You can get the grand view of the church from there. The monastery is very beautiful and wonderfully made.

Buy a double ticke for both Tor de Belem and the Monastary.2. When you have finished your visit at Tor de Belem walk back to the monastary. 3. Walk up where the exit it from the Monastary and show your ticket to the guard. He/she will scan the bar code and you are in!You can also do it if you go to the monastary first but the queue for tickets at the Tor de Belem is much less than at the monastary.

When I found myself at the door I was asked to leave, which was ridiculous, as my friends were still inside. Then I went to see the monastery. I liked the carved walls. The whole monastery looks sweet and beautiful, but that\u2019s all. No mystery, no added value, just carvings.

The queue in the ladies is long and the cubicle doors are almost transparent. You get a pretty good view of the actions of the person ahead of you as they disrobe and do their business. Very bizarre!!"

I have been to the most important historical sites in Europe (specifically my coountry Italy + France and Spain) and... this is one of the most beautiful churches and monasteries I've ever seen, both outside and inside !It is very nice also because it's made with \"clean\" stone, very different from other churches in Portugal that are very nice but along the centuries they took a yellow/orange color which somehow spoils them."

The initial reason for going to Belem was to eat the most delicious egg tarts ever - Pasteis de Belem, or what we'd call Portugese egg tarts, especially for those who eat in HK or Macau. On the way, we couldn't miss going to Sr. Jerome and the tower at Belem. The architecture of the Church, the dramatic lighting of the monuments, the perfect symmetry of the gardens, the parks, and the monument to Portugese Navigators were all awesome sites to behold. This was at a time when Portugal was not like the tourist mecca that it is now. We are so lucky to have been there."

We went into the free cathedral part and it was quite nice too, but then we paid to go into the rest of the monastery and wished we hadn't! We were there in March, and the only thing we saw when we went into the paid part was a large courtyard and a few empty rooms. There was an exhibit in one room about the history of the monastery and it's development, but it was a lot of reading to go through and by the time i was halfway through, I was tired of standing and reading. If you're going to viis the monastery, I would just go around the exterior and spend some time in the free church. Oh, and make sure to grab some Portugese tarts at Pasteis de Belem nearby, those really made the visit to Belem worth it!"

The seafaring history of the Portuguese is evident as soon as you take your first step into the cathedral. The monastery grounds are beautifully maintained, which is no small feat given the site of the site. And Vasco de Gama is there!"

Additionally, you'll see the tombs of Vasco de Gama and the poet Camoes, who lionized the explorer in a famous epic. The Monastery is in the vicinity of the coach museum, the maritime museum,an archeological museum, the tower of Belem and the Monument to the Discoveries, so there's lots to see and do."

I visited the Jeronimos Monastery on 31 August 2006, and was delighted to be there as my last visit had been in 1964 as a schoolgirl. The Monastery was as beautiful as I had remembered it, especially the cloisters which are magnificent. I now have MS, and walk with two walking sticks/canes. Imagine my dismay when I went to buy a souvenir of my visit, to find that the shop was on an upper floor, accessed by a staircase which had no handrails. I could not get up there, as there was no lift. Then my \"knight in shining armour\" appeared. Miguel Silva is working as a guide at the Monastery as part of his degree course. His English is excellent, and he quickly understood my distress. He arranged to have a suitable book brought to me, and I was most impressed by his efficiency, his courtesy, and his sympathetic understanding of how frustrating an illness like MS can be when faced by insurmountable access difficulties. Put simply, his caring action saved the day! I wish Miguel every success for the future in his chosen career. He made my day, and I shall cherish the memory of it."

Then you come to one room with a large signboard with significant dates on it. You are josteling others for the ability to read it, but even still, it was a fractured history at best. Think about church being in service when you plan your visit. It is a shame that tourists do not understand that \"silence\" in the church means no talking allowed."
