It is a journey from the late 19 century to contemporary time; you will see exceptional work hosted in 4 buildings, each hosting artworks from a specific time period. The journey is well worth spending 2 hours if you like to read the descriptions and dive into the Magical and Mystical world of This part of great Indonesia ..."

Still well worth a visit, assuming that you have already seen Neka and ARMA (as this is more of the same). This museum is hosting the best collection of works by Ida Bagus Made Poleng (probably the second best Balinese artist after I Gusti Nyoman Lempad)."

Totally dissappointing after enjoying the ARMA ( Ayung Rai Museum of Arts near Monkey Forest Sanctuary ) & Antonio Blanco Arts Museum, jusr 5-7 minutes walk away from this museum. It is spread in 4 buildings East-West-North-South , but the displayed arts work is not worth the high entry tickets charged, when compared to the displays at ARMA & A Blanco Arts Museum. Hence, do not waste time & money on this museum"

The exhibitions were beautiful, as is the garden, but I felt that it was quite expensive as I had seen it all in about 30 mins and that was with reading all the painting signs. There was also a few tourist buses here which meant that the cafe place they have was too full to use. Great to do if you want to mooch about or if it is raining (it was for my visit)."

In four buildings, you find paintings belonging to different ages with often some information near the work. Keep in mind that Balinese painting is relative new and don't expect any abstract or contemporary art. We visited the museum ourselves and could find enough information to understand the transition from traditional art as a form of religious believes to painting for pleasure. Most works are nicely conserved, however the oldest paintings are perishing. Also, the location is very quite with a nice garden to escape the busy Ubud center!"

This museum, which consists of five or so buildings and grounds, was created by the then-King, local artists, and several Westerners who had settled in Ubud in the 1920's and 30's. I don't know enough to appreciate the art fully, though I enjoyed walking through the galleries. What I came away with was a strong appreciation for the enduring value of the effort that was invested, now almost a century ago, in nurturing and preserving the work of local artists. There is quite a lot of information about the king, whose deep interest and engagement in this project laid the foundation for Ubud's development as a destination for artists. We learned about some of the local masters, whose breadth of talent was stunning and fascinating. Also interesting was the information about those early Western artists and adventurous bohemians who spent their adult lives here and clearly contributed to promoting and preserving local art. We were there on a rainy day early in our week-long stay in Ubud, and definitely found that the history we learned at this museum enriched and informed the rest of our stay."

However, we got in free of charge, thanks to my friend who has a travel business.I was only inside the main building that displayed mostly traditional paintings.

It is situated close to the market and can easily be reached on foot.The gallery consists of several exhibition halls and restaurant facilities.The exhibits cover traditional Balinese art dating from the early 1900's to the present. One gallery houses an array of earlier work which presents scenes from daily life, rituals and mythical and religious drawings and paintings. A lot of these earlier works are monochromatic, but the later work is much more colourful.The second gallery houses more paintings of daily life, agriculture, landscapes and flowers.The third gallery is dedicated to more contemporary work which is for sale to the public The drawings and paintings vary in quality, but there are some excellent artworks amongst the selection that are sold at competitive prices. The quality of the work is far better than the art generally sold to tourists in other places.This gallery will be of particular interest to visitors interested in the development of art in Bali. The only serious draw back is the lack of good lighting. Brochures with more information on the art would also be helpful, especially for people without a particular art background. The gallery would also benefit from a proper web page to promote themselves and to give tourists more information about the gallery."

I was hesitant to go in because it seemed kind of dodgy, but my adventurous fianc\u00e9 insisted to go through with it and in we did.We paid an entrance fee of around $7 which is kind of steep for this kind of attractions. The price was written clearly on the ticket as to avoid petty corruptions. The staff in the entrance was nice and helpful.There are four studios available, each with arrays of paintings and sculptures with simple descriptions relating them to the history of art and mythological stories of bali. My fianc\u00e9 who is a true art buff really enjoyed the museum, while I (a more pragmatic tourist) got bored after a few runs through the paintings.All in all it was still a nice surprised and we would recommend those who enjoy good art to visit this place!"

They each produced a square block carving of the sort used to decorate around temple doors; one with an elephant and the other with a deer. The tutor was endlessly patient with them and the end result is simply stunning! Many of the wood carving classes available in Ubud are a 3-4 hour affair and we were advised that you really needed a full day to produce something worth taking home. It cost Rp520,000 per person which included all materials, 7 hours of tuition, morning and afternoon tea and a huge,sumptuous lunch. The classes are only done with very small groups (actually our boys had the tutor to themselves!) and I felt it was well worth paying the extra money for them to go the extra mile. Elsewhere you can do a wood carving class in Ubud for US$20-30 but having seen the simple end results made in these classes I would definitely recommend this one. Not suitable for very young children or any young people with a limited concentration span, but perfect for ours or for adults who want to bring home something special from their Bali trip."

I didn't get a chance to explore the three galleries here this time (the last time I was here was some 18 years ago!) this time I booked in for a puppet making course which went for 7 hours - including an hour lunch break with a tasty meal at the cafe. I was guided through the process of creating a leather shadow puppet which was interesting and enjoyable chatting to the young puppet maker who had begun making puppets aged 10. The grounds are gorgeous and it was a lovely way to spend a day, although with a dodgey back sitting cross legged on a Pavillon at a low table was a tad uncomfortable (a bit painful really ) but worth it!"

Despite NOT recommending the museum they do run various classes, Balinese flute lesson, shadow puppet making, balinese dance lessons etc. These have to be book at least a day in advance but are totally worth it, and the classes are always individual or really small.

But unless you have a special interest in Hindu/Balinese mythology, in which case you will be a pig in mud, the collection becomes quite monotonous. A few have interesting English translations, but most do not. After a while it is like looking at the same thing over and over again. And unfortunately there is only one underlying style. Oh, I'm sure that each artist has their own, but I am not trained enough to appreciate it. Nearly all the paintings, and even sculptures, are extremely busy. There is so much going on. One could look at each picture for twenty minutes. I just got overwhelmed. On a practical basis, some of the rooms have no windows, dim lights (spend some money on LED) and faded paintings. My old eyes were not up to the task. The entry is rather steep at 85,000R, comparable to some European museums with much more extensive collections. The place was nearly empty. Many young travelers come to Ubud, and they are not able or willing to pay this much. Put the entry down to 50K and you will increase attendance enough to improve receipts. The entry includes tea in the restaurant, but they only have plain black tea or coffee, no herbal tea or even green tea. They can do better."

If you visit the studios and workshops behind the artists its even more original and better. The museum will blow your mind with art of high class . Present and the past. Bali has a unique art tradition and some of the present artist are working i groups like Lempoyang art community(founded 1985). The community is very social and combine art with the local spirit and heart and perform in local community and village. See Kommunitas Lempoyang on Facebook. They have strong representation in a present exibition in the museum, Ketut Jaya and Made Buddhiana. Go go go."

It is a really nice museum, museum grounds are like a garden. The museum mainly houses what they call modern Indonesian art, which has a lot of almost psychedelic and spiritual painting mixed with Hindu stories. There is also, of course, depictions of the daily Balinese life. There are three halls and takes about 1-1.5 hours depending on how fast you take in the art. I enjoyed it all very much.And a nice surprise is the restaurant here. It was absolutely amazing, fresh, authentic and great value. For only $10-15, you can get appetizer, main, dessert and drink. We got caught in the rain here, but just ended up spending a few hours at the restaurant, taking it in. With the sound of the raindrops on the ceiling, overlooking the beautiful garden, and having the delicious food was one of my favorite experiences in Bali and one of my favorite experiences ever for a rainy day."

The buildings were pleasant bur the artwork is mainly of a religious theme which is hardly truly representative of Balinese art. Given the excellent variety of art museums around Ubud (Neko and Blanco for a start) the 75000Rp makes this place not good value for money. And everywhere there are donations boxes asking for money to help conserve the artwork - why is this place so expensive to run that it can't afford to conserve the very things that tourists are paying to see? This is in a prominent position in Ubud and I think would not offer any encouragement for tourists to see other museums if they go here first."

I particularly like the exhibition of Gusti Nyoman Lempad\u2019s life and work. It provides a glimpse to Bali paintings that rarely known. They are like door to the culture and rich in stories.I spent one and half hour in this museum.If only I knew it earlier, I might sign up for one of their classes."

Very glad I went today, just to wander through the lovely old buildings look at paintings dating back some 600 years depicting stories from the 11th century. Very interesting to see these things so lovingly preserved. Art style in Bali have changed mightily and it is important that these old paintings and carving are kept for future generations. The gardens are lovely, and there is a museum cafe that is a great place to sit and look over them. There were also several different artisans demonstrating various craft skills which was also very interesting. The cost was 75,000 which is about AUD 7.50."

Why i saying that ? because Before Antonio Blanco come here, Balinese paint their painting which is i think it's quite unique. Balinese paint there painting with same size of picture even thou the object is far or not. For example, there is a mahoni tree d and far away from it there is a Coconut Tree. They draw the trees with same size which is the truth of course the coconut tree must be draw smaller than Mahoni tree, but they draw it with same size. But after many international painters come, Balinese now Know how to draw their painting better. The museum itself is very beautiful, there is a beautiful park also in the area of museum. located in Ubud which is the weather is quite nice and a little bit windy.

Our family of four visited the museum mid-morning, purchasing the tickets that included a meal, thinking that it would provide a good break for the kids between touring the various pavilions. That wasn't such a bad plan and may work for you, but the portions were small and not as filling as other warungs or restaurants we visited and so didn't tide the children over for the 'second half' as well as we had hoped. Presentation was excellent, though. My son marveled at the intricately carved watermelon garnish on his delicious watermelon juice, and both children devoured with their eyes and mouths the ornately displayed desserts. No surprise there.The art, housed in several buildings among peaceful gardens, is top notch (based on other museums we visited) and provides a good introduction (with some helpful explanation in English) to Balinese painting and wood carving, accompanied by the calming sounds of a single bamboo gamelan outside during our visit. As complete neophytes, we learned about the influence of Westerners such as Rudolf Bonnet and Walter Spies in the 1930s bringing Balinese painting into the modern era with the portrayal of scenes from daily life rather than religious themes and metaphors as before. We also saw why I Gusti Nyoman Lempad is so celebrated -- his finely detailed works are a cut above the rest -- along with Ida Bagus Made who seemed to be a renaissance man, creating art in all kinds of media.With a little effort, it is possible for the kids to get something out of the experience too. The grounds are great for wandering and provide a needed break between pavilions, but our 5 year old was captivated by the wood carvings and enjoyed identifying the various animals portrayed. He was pleased as punch when he later saw his proclaimed \"favorite carving\" prominently displayed on the cover of one of reference books in the small museum shop. Our eleven year old was interested in learning about the organic materials from which the traditional natural palate of Balinese colors are obtained and then trying to find the colors in the paintings, with yellow a challenge in the older paintings but white (made from crushed pig bones which was a gross-out in itself) still prominent. From the reviews, it seems that some people are evaluating the museum not on the quality of the works but on their views of the genres. For example, personally, I don't care much for the young artist school, but it is what it is. If you like the vibrancy and naivete, then you will enjoy the many examples housed in one of the pavilions. At the other extreme, the Batuan school paintings are dark but the detail is incredible. If you visit only one museum in Ubud, this should be it. A great overview and top-notch art.The museum also offers workshops in various cultural arts including gamelan, various types of painting, batik, woodcarving, shadow puppet carving, dance, offerings and more. The options overlap but Puri Lukisan seems to offer longer workshops and a greater variety of choices than those offered by the Pondok Pekak Library. On equivalent workshops offered by both, the library tends to be cheaper, and their shorter but much cheaper workshops on some arts might be more appropriate for children or those just wanting to get a taste for an hour instead of making a half day investment of their time, so if you are interested in workshops, check out both before deciding."

The instructor was so friendly and patient. He had an amazing smile, and really took time with us. They also brought us cake and a cold drink during our hour class. The class was private -- just for our family of four. They accomodated our schedule and fit us in when it was convenient for us. Afterwards, we wandered around the beautiful grounds and enjoyed seeing the art in all of the buildings. Make sure to confirm that with the price of your ticket you get a cup of coffee or tea in the nice cafe."

The museum contains mainly traditional style paintings that reflect the Balinese culture and worldview. The surroundings are very beautiful as well.

It has a spaciousparking lot, something rare in the vicinity of Ubud town center. The area has 4 buildngs for displaying Balinese paintings from different eras, most notably the era after 1930s where influences of western painters who lived in Bali at that time, are visible such as the use of colors, shading, materials and themes.There is also a Marketing 3.0 museum but it was closed during our visit.Some of the paintings probably need to be stored in some protecting enclosure. I was afraid of people, despite the signs, touching the surface of the paintings. I am also not sure about the humidity or sunshine controls. I personally like the traditional miniature paintings by artists from Keliki village. These were fine, detailed pictures of humans, animals, trees, gods, demons and so on with intricate layering of shading which makes the paintings appear to be in 3D. I actually need a magnifying glass to see some paintings as these were no more larger than A4 paper size.The area is so serene that you can use as a getaway or cooling down site after visiting the market or the Puri which tends to be crowded I the afternoon. The museum closes at 6 pm but the nearby cafe may still open until later."

Its kind of modern interpretations of Balinese traditional art, with a standout for me Ida Bagus Made.

Over a few decades, despite war, occupation, revolution, deposition, and at least one apathetic philistine in a position to throw a spanner in the works, Puri Lukisan--the Palace of Painting--was created to celebrate the incredible traditional arts of Bali. A wide range of painting techniques is employed, from painting on paper and canvas to painting on cloth, and sculpture. Many of the works are \"busy\" in the sense that Dutch and Italian cityscapes are busy: the painting are packed full of incredible detail so the longer you look at one the more you see. Wonderful stuff, and a tribute to both the visionary and persistent men who created the museum, and the artists whose works are displayed in the galleries. I am attaching a few examples of the art here.Side notes; (1) through June 28, there is a special exhibit of the works of the Keliki miniaturists. Miniaturists suggests postcard sized paintings, but here really refers to the small scale of the paintings, the better to pack more details in. Keliki is a small village near Ubud with a very high percentage of local artists: about 20% of the villagers are artists with the techniques being handed down from father to son. (2) for folks staying in the southern beach resorts, note that the convenient Nura Nura bus system does run busses up to Ubud, for 70 K each way. I've been on that road half a dozen times, and the run can take two hours due to traffic. An air-conditioned small bus is a great way to get up to Ubud, even if the promised wifi doesn't work, and the bus's second stop is right at this museum."

Because of that it tends to be a bit repetitive and although there is a brief description of the story they somehow blend into one."

A sizeable pond of blooming lotus with a stone sculpture of Lakshmi Goddess (wearing poleng sarong \u2013 typical Balinese B&W checkered fabric) in the middle of the pond had halted my steps to spend some quite moment there. I also saw a lot of little students attending a drawing class on an open space pavilion on the left. When I was there, Balinese style Wayang paintings by Ketut Madra (the master of wayang painter from Ubud) were exhibited. By chance, the curator, David Irons, who also wrote the exhibition catalogue was there and gave me a private guided tour. Thanks Mr. Irons, I did widen my knowledge, not only about Balinese paintings but also the Mahabharata and Ramayana characters. The other pavilion displays various beautiful Balinese paintings. Postcards and books of Balinese arts/paintings are available for sale at the entrance counter. What a great visit!"

We came as a class of 16 and we were able to have some hands on experience making and drawing some of the really traditional batuan paintings on a canvas and painting as well. We had some guides there to teach us on how to draw and paint. I drew a painting on Hanuman, an ancient deity of the Hindu Ramayana Epics. There were 3 guides to help us out and also i took around 2 hour to complete my drawing and time passed so fast cause the environment there was just amazing for doing the arts.Its cooling, spacious and filled with greens and it really takes your mind of almost everything. There is toilet facilities, a cafe nearby. The day was lovely, with just the right amount of sun, without it being too scorched. Tourists that passed by were just awed at what we were doing. Im really glad that I visited this place and the second day, we came we made offerings, simple ones that you would normally see on the sides of the roads in Ubud. It's really a touch of how living in Bali would be like. And I can say it's a slow and satisfied way of living!"

Before you purchase any paintings, sculptures or carvings in Bali, this museum will give you a broad overview of the trends, quality and history of the arts in Bali. This was the first museum in Ubud, conveniently located right downtown (used to be surrounded by rice paddies). It has a comprehensive collection, and some wonderful older pieces in a beautiful garden setting. The collections are clustered in multiple pavillions, and walk you through classical, Ubud, Batuan, Sanur and Young Artist developments. There are also nice examples of the evolution of the carving traditions. Unlike the best western museum exhibitions, the captions often leave something to be desired, but the visual instruction is unparalleled. Even if you're not a collector, seeing the range and depth of imagery and styles, as well as the themes in the artwork is an education in itself. The pastoral scenes, by the river and village scenes span the years when Ubud was a tiny village, to now, when tourists with long camera are painted into the temple ceremony pictures. Pure insight into the culture you would otherwise have to read volumes to glean.One carving I admired led me to seek out the artist's studio in Mas. There I was able to meet him, see his other (available) pieces, as well as the catalogues from exhibits where he'd been featured. There is a small bookstore, and the price of admission includes a free beverage. They do offer classes in their open air pavillion, book ahead."

Although the admission is a bit expensive (50,000 IDR/adult) for an Indonesian museum, it's because it's self-managed by a private institution. I find the collections are well-managed, some of them are going through renovation.There's no air-con in the building, so be prepared to suffer in a hot weather. But you can use your ticket to get a free drink in the museum's cafe.It has a number of workshops. Each takes around half a day.The museum has largely a collection of paintings, few are photographs and sculptures. Mostly the paintings depict the legends and daily lives (like farming) of the locals. The information of some artworks is incomplete, and I find the way they arrange the articles is a bit inconsistent. Nevermind this, it's still great if you want to get familiar with Balinese arts."

Museum in Bali is anice and very beautiful park area with some open houselike buildings, small cafe and couple of beautiful buildins with nice paintings on the wall. This museum gives a very good overviews of Balines art. Walking around in Bali you can see that there is a perception of art of every place and person. In this museum will become clear where it comes from."

There were some displays which provide an historical perspective on art and infiltration of westerners into Bali art circles, plus some old pieces that help preserve some of the older local artists work. Also small selection of sculptures and carvings. Short on detailed descriptions in parts and good detail elsewhere for English speakers. No audio available. It is not an extensive gallery, unlikely to be very crowded, an hour will give a good look, 2 hours to get into more detail. The offer of a free drink at the cafe that comes with entrance ticket is a nice gesture. Acceptable toilet facilities on site and free."

The entrance fee is 50,000 rupiah -which can be seen as slightly overpriced but the collection of paintings is impresive, especially modern art. We visited it during a coffee festival which meant the place was full of coffee lovers. You get a free drink with the ticket and we had a chance to see gamelan practice."

            "review": "Great overview of Balinese art. This art museum is spread over four buildings (including a fairly new one near the entrance steps) and focuses primarily on 20th century and contemporary Balinese art. The most enjoyable aspects for me were in Building I (where the I Gusti Nyoman Lempad collection is together with other earlier art styles less affected by the Western art tradition) and Building III (where wayang style paintings and tapestries are hung). Building II (which contains post-war art) and the new building (which contained a temporary contemporary art exhibition with paintings for sale and a display on the founding of the museum) were also good, but didn't captivate me as much as the other buildings. We were also fortunate enough to see an older man practising a rindik (Balinese gamelan instrument) outside Building I. He enough was nice enough to let me have a play of it!There is a lot to see at the museum and you might need close to 2 hours to do it justice. Admission to Puri Lukisan is Rp 50000 per person and includes a tea, coffee or mineral water at the cafe.During this trip, I also went to the ARMA Museum in Peliatan. If you had to choose between them, I would slightly prefer the ARMA Museum, mainly because the conservation practices are a little better there. Some of the older works in Puri Lukisan are starting to fade, though you can still clearly see the intentions of the artists."

The Museum Entrance has been rebuilt since we last came (in 2010) and the whole museum has been revamped and cleaned up.The permanent collection is, as always, excellent, fascinating and well presented.There was a new exhibition when we were there with new Balinese artists and historical background which was very interesting and worthwhile.Two children (age 10 and 12) did a painting workshop for a whole morning. The painter who taught the lesson spoke good English, was very talented and friendly and the kids had a great time. They even received traditional treats (fried banana). The price for the workshop is about 10 U$ per hour per kid. Paintre's name is I Wayan Warta Yasa.They also opened a new restaurant there, but we did not eat at the Museum."

It helped having done a little reading about Balinese art online and in my guide books before going so I had some sort of reference point, because there isn't much interpretive stuff at the museum. However they have an extensive collection of what is considered classical Balinese art and examples from some of Bali's top artists."

            "review": "For art lovers who know their history of modern Balinese art period. An interesting art gallery heavily focused on the artistic commune that formed between local and overseas collaborators between the 1930s and 60s, it is situated in a large compound that looks to have been recently renovated, and of course, made to look a bit like a temple. The labeling and explanation is a bit hit-and-miss, sometimes providing adequate background info, and other times non-existent, which is weird considering how modern the whole place looks. Some quite old pieces exist, though really the art is a modern take on traditional Balinese design and themes, influenced by western sensibilities and containing an insane amount of detail. Art classes exist, though you need to prebook. The cafe on site has a nice dessert menu, and your ticket entitles you to one free drink."

I would have liked to have spent hours more here investigating the insane detail of the traditional paintings. The gardens are great too, and you get a free cold drink with the price of entry. Highly recommended especially if you intend to buy some art while you're there. Don't go shopping in the local \"fine art\" galleries and artists' cooperatives with their formulaic abstracts and talentless exotica until you've seen how good Balinese art can be."

            "review": "A brilliant cultural experience. Our family of 2 adults and 3 children divided in two groups and tried mask painting and basket weaving. The 75000rp covered all our materials and morning tea and our teachers were very generous with their time. The allocated 3 hours turned into 5 because of our dedication! and we were grateful for their patience. The teacher taking the mask painting spoke no English and this was no problem even for our 9 year old who was happy to follow the steps. Nyomen was our basket weaving teacher and she spoke English well enough to teach us some Bahasa. Our 11 year old son had no problem following her directions although I think a much younger child would struggle.The best part was coming away from an experience where we had totally immersed ourselves in something different and each had a sense of accomplishment as we took our own souvenirs away along with the memory of just being there.The setting was beautiful. We each worked in a traditional pavilion among the museum grounds where it was quiet and just a delight to feel removed from the hustle of touristy Ubud. If you are looking for something a bit different and have the patience to sit and try something new then I would thoroughly recommend it. The museum also has batik painting, balinese dance and gamelon instruction.They also have a restaurant and lovely clean toilet facilities."

Once my choice was made, 2 clean sheets of paper were produced and I then spent the day learning how to sketch, outline, shade and paint using layer upon layer of color. The artist was very patient, showing me \u2018step by step\u2019 as he put it. If I needed help, he gave it. I was the only student, but he does take up to 4 people in the busy season. As well as the class drinks, snacks and a delicious lunch were included."
