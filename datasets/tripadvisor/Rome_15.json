The inside is spectacular in and of itself as it was once home to the Borghese family. The sculptures by Rafael Bernini are what set this museum apart from others. Such unbelievable artistry. Be sure to see the sculture of Daphne and Apollo. We were staying near the Piazza di Popolo so it was an easy walk through the Borghese Gardens to get there. The gardens are quite beautiful and a wonderful respite from the frenetic energy of Rome."

They have one of the finest private art collections in the world. Before entering, check out the gardens and park. Time is rigidly restricted to 90 minutes per reservation. Yes, reservations are required and can be make on line. The process keeps the crowds down allowing more enjoyment of the exhibits. Hint: you can reserve telephonically and receive special consideration if you have purchased the \"Rome pass\"."

Audio Guides are available and are probably pretty essential. But better yet are the museum sponsored guides available in English at fixed times in the morning. Having a tour guide enhances the visit immeasurably, and is surprisingly inexpensive. Be sure to include this feature when making your reservation. Felix, our tour guide was an art expert yet very down to earth and accessible. Without a guide (or perhaps the audio guide) I can't imagine how one would get a sense of the entire museum."

It was a good thing we had made advance reservations before our trip, because when we arrived there was a sign saying there were no tickets available for the next 11 days. I can't imagine our trip to Rome without our visit to the Borghese Gallery. The audio rentals are worth the money, but get in line no later than 20-15 minutes before your reserved Gallery time. They do not start renting them until 10 minutes before but the line gets very long quickly. You only have two hours to look at everything but we were able to enjoy it all by going to the least crowded rooms first. Make sure to tell the taxi driver that you are going to the Gallery and not the Villa because they are on opposite sides of the park/gardens. Also, with so many tourist, if you stop by the cafe it can get confusing. Pay for your items first then get in the next line where all items will be retrieved for you."

            "review": "Mind Boggling Art, Magnificent Setting . Quite simply said, one gets a two-fer here, the art of the pictures and sculptures then the art of the fabulous villa and gardens. From one gigantic room filled with some of the greatest art created by the greatest artists to the next one very nearly goes culture blind from overload. One recent visit I photographed only the art on ceilings in the glorious rooms and quickly had an album of sublime photos. The collector was a patron of Bernini and some of him greatest works are here. A room of Caravaggio's! There is more eye candy here than one can manage in one visit. You must make a timed reservation, and exchange for an admittance upon arrival. No admittance without a reserved ticket and the ticket is limited to a 2 hour visit. It was jam packed every day I visited. Rather unfortunate that large groups with guides pack the rooms and all the guides are talking at the same time. Very disconcerting."

We visited the Borghese Gallery 4 years ago and recently had the opportunity to take our friends with us on a return visit.We toured Borghese in the morning and the Vatican in afternoon. The wonderful thing about Borghese is the lack of a crowd. They only admit 200 at a time for 2 hours. Reservations are a must. Opt for the audio tour, it is extremely well done!The art is fantastic and a wonderful variety is in place which provides a nice overview without overwhelming the visitor.In contrast, our visit in the afternoon to the Vatican was disappointing. The crowds were horrific and the amount of art was simply overwhelming. The Sistine Chapel was literally elbow to elbow which prevented visitors from having the opportunity to absorb the magnificent works. It was truly sad that the crowds have grown to such a degree since our last visit 4 years ago. And our visit this time was off season for tourists. I can't imagine what it is like in the summer.Of course, visitors to Rome must do the Vatican and Sistine Chapel. It is simply a must. However, I would strongly urge visitors go to Borghese to take in magnificent art and focus the Vatican visit to St. Peter's and the Sistine Chapel."

We went on a Saturday afternoon and the next available tickets were for the following Thursday. If you have booked online you get a reservation voucher by e-mail You need to exchange tis for your tickets well before your timed entry. You can choose a 2 hour slot which is just about enough time to see the treasures here. We had rucksacks with us and it was free and simple to store them in the cloakroom. The gallery is beautiful with so many things to see it would take ages to list them all, Caraveggio paintings, Bernini statues, amazing frescos on the walls, mosaics of the floor. It is glorious, and not too tiring - long enough to look without being overwhelmed. The gardens are beautiful too, with people on bicycle \"vehicles\" - parents pedalling and a row of little children sat up front laughing with excitement. Lovely area for families"

While it obviously doesn't have the scale and scope of the Vatican museums or the Uffizi in Florence, it's just the right size for a good dose of beauty before you start to feel museum-ed out, and the collection of Bernini sculptures is truly spectacular. His pieces come to life in such an amazing way, and in this setting you can really see and feel them up close. The rest of the collection is also just extremely well curated, and the building itself is beautiful as well. Be sure to make a reservation in advance, especially if you're not there in the off season, because you don't want to miss this one!"

However, we did get a slot on the day we wanted, and we were grateful. It's not easy to get to the Borghese Gallery by Metro - it's about a 20 minute walk from the Barbarini Metro stop. Once at the Borghese, turn in your confirmation number for a ticket. You have to check ALL bags - including purses, no matter how small. You have to wear your jackets. Go figure. People began lining up for our 2 hour time slot about 10 minutes early. We spent a very enjoyable hour here with our two children (aged 10 and 12). They particularly enjoyed the statues, especially those related to Greek and Roman mythology (I prepped them before hand on what we'd be seeing). The paintings weren't as big a hit with the kids, but that's okay. Overall it was a very successful outing and gave the kids something to think about!"

The day we want it was sold out to the general public and did not have any openings for 5 more days. Well worth the time and effort to book ahead. They do have a lobby area and cafe open to the public, however this means that anyone can come in and sit down beside you. My husband witness a young lady with her mom take down a pickpockerter. They pinned him to the ground while they made sure he had not taken any of their belongings. No one helped these ladies or arrested this criminal once they let him go. The ladies were stunned and left the museum. So be ware."

The audioguide is sooo good at explaining certain pieces (not everything is covered...othwrwise they'd never get you out in 2 hours!!).Each room is superbly opulent! Floor to ceiling masterpieces (literally). Beautiful mosaics...stunning ceiling decor. It's an overwhelming assault for the eyes at first. Staff are welcoming and friendly as they protect the art from the public.Go see...worth it for the weird inteplay between biblical stories (Jesus++, St Paul, St Peter etc), with the Greek/Roman mythology. Despite being a cardinal...think Mr Borgese was more into art than scripture etc. Worth it too for the sheer beauty.of many priceless pieces."

You will pay an extra 2 eur for the online service, but you don't really have an alternative (I mean there is an alternative, but that is to give your credit card details over the phone to a robot...). They let about 50 people get inside every two hours so that the villa doesn't get too crowded. This is why there is a limited number of tickets. If you book a 9'00 o'clock, for instance, you should get there a bit earlier. They say 30 minutes, but even less is enough. Even if you are late, if you still pick up our 9 o'clock entry ticket, you can get inside. The villa will take from 1 hour to 2 hours to visit. But once in, nobody will kick you out. Important: Though you buy your ticket online, you have to go the ticket office downstairs in the villa to get the actual ticket with your booking number. You won't pay anything extra, they just print your ticket. If you stay more than 5 days in Rome, you could go buy the tickets in person for the following week. Otherwise you need to buy it online."

            "review": "Very high demand - plan in advance. It's not a very large museum and they only sell a limited number of tickets each day (and for each time period) so it's best to buy your tickets well in advance. Your ticket allows you to visit the museum during the 2-hour period you've purchased and then they usher you out. Even before you arrive it can be confusing as the entrance is not clearly marked (enter through the bookshop). We wanted to purchase the normal tickets but the only tickets available for that morning were for the guided tour in Italian so we had to pay 19.50\u20ac each plus the 2\u20ac \"hidden\" pre-sale fee so 21.50\u20ac total. A long line of people (in a crowded hall) queuing for coat check made it a bit more confusing but eventually we discovered that we needed to show proof of our online ticket purchase to get our tickets. Then we had to go to another line to get the audiobox and earphone for the guided tour. The unenthusiastic tour guide explained to another young man that the tour was only in Italian and if he wanted another language that was his problem. When we got to the point where a woman ripped the ticket (to validate it) she explained that no bags were allowed - so we had to go back to the coat check. Fortunately by that time there was almost line. We went back to the line and rejoined our tour. By that time the tour guide was already explaining the third room; she didn't wait for us. It was a bit hard to hear with the earpiece and so many people so we decided to ditch the tour and explore the museum on our own. There were sheets of laminated paper explaining most of the rooms (in Italian and English) so I don't think we missed too much.While they could do a better job organizing the whole process, the museum is a real gem. Take time to explore the lovely grounds outside as the palace is set in a beautiful park."

We went on a guided tour (highly recommended, or at least get the audio box so you can walk around independently) and our guide was very knowledgeable. This was our second time visiting the Museum, the first time 13 years ago, but we liked it so much we wanted to go back this year. I would recommend buying tickets ahead of time, maybe a couple weeks in advance, because they seem to sell out daily. I think it is nearly impossible to walk up and buy same day tickets. Also, I think you only get to be able to go for about 90 minutes at a time, you can't spend all day there. But there is so much to see while there, you just can't see it all in one visit! It is one of the highlights of visiting Rome, in my opinion."

The displays are open and you can get closer than most museum allow. HINT* We were delayed waiting for a missing group member and instructed to start the tour on the second floor.

The ceilings alone are jaw dropping and the sculpture and painting collection feature Bernini, whose Apollo and Daphne is exquisite, while other paitings by Titian, Carravagio, Raphael and DaVinci also delight. The self walking tour is very informative and the quality of the recorded material is excellent. Give yourself 2 hours to listen and see everything. The grounds surrounding the Gallery are picturesque and there are several lovely ponds. The Gallery is renovating the gardens attached to the home which should be lovely once finished. Hope to see it again then."

            "review": "Do you like amazing art?. My wife and I really enjoyed the Borghese. Situated just outside the north wall of ancient Rome in a villa set in a gorgeous park setting and still walking distance from many of the main attractions, this small to medium size gallery has just enough amazing art on display to wow you without overwhelming you. We took a guided tour through City Wonders and Mike was our tour guide. He was fantastic, giving us a lot of perspective on the art and stories that really made the paintings and sculptures come alive. I will say this was one of the few attractions that did not have long lines at this time of year, however it does require reservations. If you plan ahead you can purchase tickets on line very inexpensively to see this gallery on your own. Personally we preferred the tour with Mike. Whether you choose to visit or not may depend on the length of your stay in Rome. There are other amazing attractions that most tourists will want to see first, (check out the Trip Advisor website or Rick Steves website)but if you are spending more than a couple of days in Rome and you love art (in which case you already know about this place) I would definitely put this museum on your list. If you don't think of yourself as an art lover then find Mike and take the tour."

We visited late in the afternoon with a very small tour ( 3 of us) and a terrific tour guide named Teresa , this was by far the best tour we've done in Rome .The borghese gallery is small but beautiful.we learnt so much about the artworks and historical facts that we wouldn't have if we didn't do the tour with such an informative guide.Unfortunately though, we found the gardens to be run down and very unattended which is such a shame. Come on Rome clean these beautiful gardens up and bring them back to their former glory"

Print your reservation and go to the counter at least half an hour before your visit starts. The museum tickets are always sold out. So a reservation is a must.It is the third time that we visited this museum. This year there was a much bigger crowd than before. It is obvious that the museum increased the number of people allowed. This is really a pity. Now you also get in this museum people who are not \u2018really\u2019 interested in what there is to see. They only look on there smartphone, standing in the way and obstructing other visitors the see the exhibition; very annoying. Fortunately the smartphone adepts are gone after 45 minutes. So you still have an hour left to enjoy this fabulous museum. A note for the luggage > you have to leave everything in the luggage storage, you get a small plastic bag for you wallet and your phone. It not longer allowed to take some water in the museum, not even a very small bottle. But the museum is air-conditioned now. Two years ago it was still steaming hot. If there is only one museum you can visit in Rome, take this one. You will find the best pieces of Bernini and Caravaggio."

All I can say is that when you walked into the first room from the entrance and look up at the ceiling, you know you are in a special place. It would be hard not to be in awe of the magnificent beauty all around you. Each room is magnificent in its own way. The sculptures by Bernini are exceptional. We took a couple who had never been there before, and they were just thoroughly amazed with the gallery.If you have the time, I feel this is a sight in Rome that should not be missed.Several point that might be helpful:* Buy/reserve tickets in advance, on-line.* Prior to entering the gallery, all visitors must check-in all bags, backpacks, purses, etc. * You are now allowed to take pictures inside the gallery. During my earlier visit, no photos were allowed."

This museum has plenty to see but it is not overwhelming like the Pradoor the Louvre. It is bite sized. But, oh what a delicious bite of art candy!There are two floors and one has two hours so plan your time accordingly. I tried to help someone get upstairs with ten min left in the time period and it was already too late. They had closed the doors to the second floor.I really enjoyed the second floor with many paintings in a beautiful space. The first floor is mostly sculpture with Bernini's works being the most famous. Carraviaggio is featured on floor one and his works are a must see. Probably the best collection of his work in the world. The grounds are also beautiful and the park is very well kept. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.This museum is a must see in Roma!"

First of all, apart from being a museum it allows to understand how an oligarch lived in the middle ages - well pretty much the same as now. :) Secondly, it houses some of the best of Bernini, who is my favorite among sculptors, and importantly it houses Bernini's David, who is my favorite among Davids. It also has many other famous pieces of art. Finally before and/or after visiting the Gallery you can walk for hours in the beautiful Villa Borghese gardens, which is very relaxing. Make sure you buy tickets online or reserve them on phone, no other way to get into the gallery. Visiting Rome and not visiting Borghese is unimaginable."

Unfortunately it also has the rudest staff we have ever encountered in a gallery. They are unnecessarily aggressive and generally unpleasant - multiple instances we observed supported this view. We even saw one young man attempt to prevent a mother from feeding her hungry baby in one of the rooms. Impossible to imagine why this would cause any threat to the exhibition - it could not be on the basis of modesty as there were more bare breasts on display on the walls than anywhere else you are likely to visit."

If you ever considered sculpture by other great artists, ensure you don't miss what this museum offers - GL Bernini, a true master where numerous works are displayed. This museum may be small but its contents are rich in history & beauty! Do not miss this museum, but ensure to reserve your space /time for entry. Highly recommend this to all who come to Rome as a \"must see\"!"

When you arrive (early, of course, and with your previously purchased tickets) you will be stripped of your purse. Yes, that's right. You cannot have your purse with you in the museum. For some reason, not explained, your purse offends the museum!(I am not talking about a backpack or suitcase. Just an ordinary lady's purse, not large.)Now, I have no pockets on my clothes. So the 'guard' rudely thrust a plastic bag at me. I put everything that was in my purse, in the plastic bag. And then checked my purse. So stupid. And, of course, the line up to check my purse was 15 minutes. Remember that your ticket only buys you 2 hours. And they do not care that following their useless and weird rules eats up 15 minutes of the time for which you paid. Annoying and ridiculous. Now you are on the clock. Race through the museum. There is no time for contemplation or reflection. This is a meat-grinder venue: get their money, get 'em in, get 'em out. There are papers in each room, explaining the items in that room. However, you do not have enough time to read the papers, review the items and comprehend. There simply isn't enough time. Run through, snap a few photos and get the hell out. Out of the galleries...so you can wait in line, again, the get your purse back!Really?!?!There are better things to do and see. Don't bother with this. Or if you must, be prepared for the nightmare."

However, a lot of school trips would stop in front of specific paintings for long periods of time and take all of the seating in the room. Could be a problem. Other school trips were perfectly fine, but one school had a noisy teacher who told other people to shush while she would talk to her group which was rude. The toilets were not brilliant (a bit messy and not very clean when I went in) and were located between floors.The gardens were beautiful and you could not fault the interior and exterior art works. The interior gift shop is reasonably well stocked, slightly expensive and often busy, but worth a visit Nearby there are a lot of ice cream trucks for sunny days. Beautiful place to visit.

You need to book a 2-hour time slot so I booked 11.00 am to 1.00 pm. We booked our tickets through ticketone.it before travelling. There was a booking fee of 4 euros but we felt the convenience was worth it. We received an email confirmation which we had to print and take to the ticket office on arrival which was exchanged for an entry ticket. We were staying near the Piazza Navona but taking a taxi seemed the easiest way to get there. Once there, you can buy a book in the shop which tells you about the main exhibits, or you can hire an audio guide. We preferred to just walk around and found that in some rooms there were laminated descriptions of the exhibits which were in several languages which you could walk around with and then return. Unfortunately I had left my reading glasses in my bag which had to be handed in on entry so wasn't able to read anything. The museum comprises two floors with several rooms. On the ground floor there are several Bernini sculptures which I can only describe as absolutely stunning and amazing. The upper floor rooms contain paintings only but for us the sculptures were one of the highlights of our visit to Rome."

The park is wonderful, the house itself is amazing, and the art is one of a kind! I'm going to ruffle some feathers here: Bernini's David is much more dynamic, exciting and emotional than Michelangelo's It was by far my favorite, and we went the next day to Florence, waited in a brutal line, waded through huge crowds to lay eyes on Michelangelo's David, which was really a marvel itself. However, not as emotionally charged, not full of power and kinetic energy as Bernini's If you only see one museum in Italy, make it this one. In fact, go out of your way to get here, as what we saw here will stick with us forever."

It's much smaller in scale but has breathtaking pieces from Bernini that you really have to see in person to appreciate fully. I personally prefer Bernini's David to Michelangelo's--the level of detail, action and emotion in his pieces really move you--and the Gallery is set up nicely so that the major pieces each have their own room so you can view and contemplate and give them the time they deserve. The crowd control and advance reservation process is a bit annoying, but in the end it really helps enhance your experience. Leave some time afterwards to explore the park. We rented one of those 4-person bikes afterwards and rode around the grounds and it was lovely and the kids really enjoyed it."

The building itself---with elaborate and varied decorations on walls, floors and ceilings---is very impressive. There are several Roman mosaics on the floor in a great state of preservation. The high points for us were the amazing Bernini sculptures---ranging over much of his career---and the 6 Caravaggio paintings. But there is a lot more too. Visitors enter in two-hour \"shifts\", and this was about the right amount of time for the two floors. It's not a large museum---just about right for our taste.

I loved seeing Bernini's sculptures (David in particular) and loved the beautiful ceilings of the villa. The Borghese Gallery is much less crowded than other attractions due to the reservation requirement and it was amazing to be able to see some amazing paintings (like Raphael's Portrait of a Lady with a Unicorn and The Deposition) so close without crowds.

Even though we have been to Rome several times,we've never visited Villa Borghese.I contacted Tuscanyall.com,a Rome museum excursion company and arranged for a private tour.The Borghese Gallery is quite unique in that they monitor how many people are admitted to view the works of art .Tickets are a must and there are designated times in 2&1/2 intervals.We met our tour guide,Mr Alvise Tarantello in front and waited till our designated time slot.Mr Tarantello was wonderful! His knowledge of the Borghese and the works of Bernini,Caravaggio,Canova and Titian was wonderful and insightful.We all enjoyed it,and that was because of Mr Tarantello."

It was a long tour for two 79 year olds, two hours, but, limited, seating was available in many galleries. The magnificence of the rooms, their themes and contents were simply placed before each of us by Anna, for us to wonder at. We could question Anna at any time and receive pertinent answers. Her love of the art and her job were central to our totally satisfying experience. We were favoured indeed.anna, if you read this A BIG THANK YOU!"

This is Italy, this is Rome, and nowhere, even in Rome itself, there is something so exquisite as the scuptures you will enjoy in Villa Borghese, where the marble becomes tender and you feel it so alive that your hand becomes the hand touching the flesh of Persephone, as if you were the god, and your eyes rest on the languid figure that Canova created. A rich collection of paintings will give you an even deeper aprehension of sublime art. Villa Borghese puts you steps above your previous self."

The official ticketing website is 'ticketone [dot] it' and you want to search for 'Galleria Borghese - Biglietti'. It is also here that you will find all the information you need about opening hours, rules of ticketing, days the gallery will be closed and where you can choose your day and time to enter the gallery. Do not even entertain the idea that you might be able to buy on the spot same day tickets here. You MUST book to see the wonders that this gallery holds, and know what time you plan to go in because your entry time is strictly adhered to (everyone lines up into this huge snake around the foyer). While you will still be allowed in after your allocated time within the two hour block (e.g. you enter the gallery at 11:30am instead of 11:00am) you will be promptly told to vacate the gallery as soon as the 2 hour time limit is over to make way for the next group, regardless of when you decided to enter.I was scared that 2 hours wasn't going to be enough time for me to see everything in the gallery, but rest assured that 2 hours is plenty of time to take as many photos as your camera can store and to cry over the absolute ART!!! that you will have the privilege to see with your own eyes. YES, all the rumours are true!- It is absolutely exquisite work that you get to see in there.Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to collect your tickets, as you MUST leave all bags and clunky objects with staff and the lines for both services can get quite long. There is an audio guide available for those who would like one as well. After you finish enjoying the gallery, make sure you take time to explore the gardens as well if the weather allows. My family decided to hire a big 4 person bike (we were permitted to fit 5 people on it, with responsibility of safety on us) and it was so much fun pedaling this huge bike around the garden! It is partially motorised and fitted with a big brake to help you get up and down the slopes of the garden. We hired the bikes by turning right after we exited the gallery from the gift shop and walked down the path leading towards the zoo within the gardens. The bikes are available for hourly hires, where you will have to leave some form of ID with staff before collecting it back when you return the bike."

We bought ticketsfrom tour groups that overbought and were able to get in. The numbers are limited so it becomes an uncrowded and up close, personal experience. We wandered about at a leisurely pace. It's more interesting if YOU are familiar with mythology. Many of the works are related to myths, which was interesting since Borghese was a cardinal for the Catholic church and related to the Pope! There is a more realistic DAVID sculptue by Bernini. (More masculine and realistic version than Michaelangelos David.)Bernini has become one of my favorite artists due to this museum. Notice- one visit take all the pictures you want at these museums whereas the next visit- NO PHOTOS!"

It is the third largest public park in Rome after the ones of the Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. The gardens were developed for the Villa Borghese Pinciana built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a villa suburbana, a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the early nineteenth century. You enjoy a fully day in the gardens of the Villa with the walking promenade, fountains and there is restaurants, attractions for children and families too. I had a wonderful time there before continuing my way to the City Florence."

We arrive 1.5 hours early and went to the front desk to get our tickets. They indicated to wait outside for our tour guide to arrive. My wife received a text on her phone with a confirmation number so I used that number to actually get our tickets. 20 minutes to 3pm we stood in a line to check in. Wrong line for our tour group. Nobody indicates where each tour group is suppose to meet and both the counter staff and other tour groups could care less to give you and directions. Another couple had booked through the same tour group and totally missed out on getting in at all, because they did not receive the text which contained the ID the counter agent needed to print your tickets. Our tour guide never showed up. Make sure you check all your hats, selfie sticks, bags, purses and umbrellas at the coat check as they will send you out of line to put it away. What happened to me is they tore my ticket sent me away to check my selfie stick. When I tried to re-enter after checking my selfie stick, they looked at me confused like they had never seen me before.... You just yelled at me to check my selfie stick and throw away my water bottle. What ever, We got in anyways and walked around and looked at the sculptures and paintings by ourselves without a tour guide. They only give you 2 hours per 'group' in the museum. We did eavesdrop on other tour groups in the museum so we could get a little background on each room and some of the paintings. Lots of famous pantings and sculptures done by famous artists. Worth seeing if you can getting inside."

It\u2019s relatively small, but the art it houses \u2013 amazing. It has the largest collection of Bernini\u2019s in the world and they alone are worth the trip. To see these sculptures with their amazing movement embodied in marble something to behold. Rent the audio guides (5 euros each) to get the backstory of the piece, museum, how the acquired the pieces (much of it somewhat unscrupulously). You\u2019ll need reservations as they only let in a limited number every two hours. Start with the paintings (as the Rick Steve\u2019s guide book suggested) rather than the sculptures and you\u2019ll have the sculptures almost to yourself. You can bring in your camera and take photos, but no flash. Everything else needs to be checked. But beware, the Borghese park is huge so it\u2019s a fair walk to get to the Gallery itself. You can rent rickshaw type bikes to get there though. There are a few food and drink stalls throughout the park as well as a cafeteria and gift store in the Gallery. Drawbacks: Reservations only. Long walk to get to the Gallery"

Id booked a tour through Viator, our guide was outside, we were running a bit late as we'd walked and the estate is quite big, lots of paths, roundabouts and greenery to walk through until you reach the gallery. (looks like a huge house). give yourself plenty of time. You have to book in a time slot, there was only the two of us and one other man which made the tour better as it much more intimate. we had to leave our bags at the desk and just take your camera with you. it was quite busy but easy to get around, our guide explained this is a very special art collection as it is the only place in the world to have 6 Caravaggio paintings and 5 Bernini sculptures (or something like that) very impressive! It includes Caravggios paintings Saint Jerome Writing, St john the Baptist, Madonna child and Serpent, Boy with a basket of Fruit, and Young Sick Bacchus. All beautiful paintings, along with other works of art, egyptian hieroglyphs, chairs, sphinx statues, and of course sculptures by Bernini. These were impressive, stunningly beautiful and a real highight for me, his earliest work was Goat Amalthea with Infant Jupiter and Faun, Aeneas, Anchises & Ascanius. Rape of Proserpine is absolutely beautiful, revolutionary at the same time, to turn a chunk of marble into a masterpiece showing fluidity, movement, flowing hair, tears and features including grief and pain. absolutely groundbreaking and beautiful! also sculptures 'David' and 'Apollo and Daphne' is a triumph. Stunning works of art by an artist who was very young. Definitely worth a visit, definitely get a tour guide as you'll miss out on alot if you have no idea of the context of the artwork. Absolutely beautiful museum and felt very privileged to be let in, never mind get shown around. it feels priceless and a very special experience. Fantastic."

The Villa, built as a fun palace for Cardinal Scipio Borghese, was the first attraction that I saw on visiting Italy as a student in 1975. I was astounded by the sculptures and pictures but surprised by the decay of the building. Returning with Maggie ten years after that, it was closed for restoration - and still closed ten years later! Third time lucky, and the loving restoration has worked marvels. The ornate walls, ceilings and floors are dazzling - the floors of the central ground floor room contain the best Roman mosaics of gladiators to be found anywhere in the world. Scipio Borghese was a patron of the young Bernini and Caravaggio: Bernini's 'David' (the deliberate opposite of Michelanglo's) and 'Apollo & Daphne' are stupendous and the Caravaggios are beguiling; two Bernini busts of the fun-loving Cardinal are on show, because the first had a flaw in the marble. The Borghese family were forced to sell 200 pictures & sculptures to Napoleon, but what remains includes Titian's 'Sacred & Profane Love' and Canova's 'Pauline Bonaparte as Venus', which are both exquisite.The Villa was built as an intimate space to show treasures to a select few, and capacity is limited. The two-hour ticket slots give ample time, but they are often sold out weeks in advance. We were lucky: it was sold out but, as it was September, we could go back at five. You can buy the tickets online in advance - and buy well in advance: the museum's own site sent me to an inaccessible website, but the Italy musems site allows you to select dates and time slots. It is a bit of a hassle, but well worth the effort!"

            "review": "A must when in Rome. The Borghese was by far my favourite part of our trip to Rome (surpassing even the Vatican museums/St Peter's Basilica and the Colosseum). It showcases incredible works by Bernini, Caravaggio, Raphael, and many more. The beautifully decorated villa itself would be worth the entry fee even with all the sculptures and paintings removed. The audio guide was very good (a bit more focused on history than technique) and each room had laminated leaflets identifying all the works and describing the most important ones (including the ceilings). The fact that only 360 people can enter the gallery in each 2-hr time slot makes the experience so much more enjoyable. Don't forget you must pre-reserve your tickets by phone or online before visiting. Also, if you make a bee-line to the second floor and do the painting gallery before the sculptures on the first floor you will have even fewer spectators to contend with. My only complaint? 2 hours isn't nearly long enough to view this collection! Make sure you arrive 30 min before your reservation time to pick up tickets and grab your audio guide (available 20 min before your reservation time) before checking your bag (all must be checked) for the shortest lines."

Took a taxi there from Piazza del Popolo @ \u20ac9 for 3 persons. Stress free so worth it. A great guided tour by \"Felix\" who gave us enough info to keep us up beat and keen to be there. His style was relaxed but knowledgeable and witty. Excellent ambassador. Had brunch in the cafe which was very good and not expensive for Rome. As we exited we were all agreed that it was well worth the visit. It was very hot so we caught the tourist train from the front of the gallery around the park for \u20ac3. It duly delivered us through the beautiful grounds back to the majestic view of the Popolo Piazza. Great photo opportunity, we descended the steps to the side and were again stress free returned to the bustle of the city. We too had worried how to get there and back - no need to. Taxi and \"Disney \" style train, sorted. Felix, you were great. We agree that Berninis work is remarkable. A stunning Gallery."

You can do it on line at the official website and it is worthwhile doing so. You can usually get in five or ten minutes before your time, but not much more.Second, understand you will have to check anything larger than a camera or a wallet at the baggage check before they will let you enter. I don't think anything has ever gone missing on them. Quite an accomplishment.Third, the bookshop/souvenir shop is a little dear, but it has stuff that you won't find anywhere else.Fourth, the coffee shop is good for arriving early, sitting with your coffee while awaiting your entry time. I like the staff there: They treat me with respect, but don't suffer fools or dumb tourists gladly.Finally, the Galleria itself is a gem. There was not a room that did not entrance and engage my teenaged granddaughter (16) or grandson (12) in one way or another. And that is a major accomplishment after weeks of concentrated exposure to history, art, culture, architecture, etc. etc.One last bit of advice: Take the time to read up ahead of time about all of the exquisite statuary, paintings , etc. that you will see as you pass thorough. The Berninis, Caravaggios, Titians all deserve more than just a passing glance. If you do take the time to do a bit of studying in advance, you will be rewarded many, many times over in terms of appreciation and understanding.So, Go and Enjoy. Two to Three unhurried hours is just right for a visit. And you will want to go back again for more another time."

If you can't get tickets then you'll need to hire a guide, check with your hotel. I suggest getting the audio (assuming you do not have a guide), it is 5E. Purses and back packs need to be checked. The Borghese only allows a certain number of people into the gallery - your viewing is just two hours. Start on the second floor since most people when entering start on the first floor.On Sunday's it is free, but you still need to reserve a ticket which cost about 2E.

As noted in other reviews it is a little off of the normal tourist track, and you do need to make a reservation in advance for a two hour visiting block, but it is worth it to see an amazing collection of sculpture and paintings in a relaxed, non -rushed setting. Indeed, this is a collection that compares against any other in the world. It is housed in a beautiful villa in a large park in Rome.We had no difficulty making our reservation online two days before, but I understand that since we went mid-August when many locals were on vacation it may have been a little easier. Make sure you make your reservation through the Rome museums website instead of the commercial websites that will pop up if you do a google search for the museum. After making your reservation, you need to go to the ticket counter in the lower level to pick up your tickets, check your bags, and go to the bathroom of you need to. There is also a small bookshop and cafe on the lower level. Your ticket allows entry during a two hour block of time, and most people arrive a little early and line up at the main doors.We found two hours to be plenty to view the collection at a leisurely pace in the two story villa. In fact, we were done after about 1 1/2 hours of leisurely viewing. We found the first few rooms to be a little crowded when we entered, but after that the crowds thinned out which allowed for a very pleasant viewing experience. Having come from the Vatican Museum that morning which was wall-to-wall people, this was an extremely pleasurable experience. Others have mentioned the contents of the collection, let me just say it is world-class and spectacular. The first floor rooms are magnificent and contain most of the sculpture along with some of the artwork. The second floor is mostly artwork. There is a winding staircase from the first to second floors which may be difficult for some, but there is a small elevator operated by staff for those who are mobility impaired. The gallery is located in the Villa Borghese, the second largest park in Rome. When you are finished with the Galleria, the park contains lots of other things to do. You can ride a mini train around the park to other museums, rent 4 wheel bikes, or walk the grounds. A pleasant way to spend half a day in Rome away from the crowds."

This museum houses the Rape of Proserpine, Apollo and Daphne by Bernini as well as a famous sculpture of Napoleon's exhibitionist sister, Pauline. The rest is standard museum art fare unless you are an avid art student. You must buy tickets in advance (we bought ours on their internet site a month prior) for an assigned two hour period. You must be present at your appointed hour to get in. Pick up your tickets at the ticket office with your voucher about 15 minutes prior. If you didn't buy tickets in advance you probably won't get in. I saw people being turned away. They are strict on even taking in small bags but make a bag check available for free. The facility has a decent cafeteria for snacks. The herds all line up pushing and shoving to get in first but there's no rush. Two hours is plenty of time to see everything and do a little studying as well. And if you hang back, they all clear out so you can see everything without the crowds. Unless you are going there to see something specific as we did and have an extra two hours to spend, the Vatican and Capitoline museums will give you plenty more to absorb for about the same expense."

Since my daughter uses a manual wheelchair, we always check the accessibility of the sites we are about to visit. In the \"Gallery Borghese\" official site I couldn't find any information. I searched in other sites and found out that a wheelchair user can visit only the ground floor so we decided to give it a try.Upon arriving at the site we were told to go to the back door and press the doorbell. An employee opened the door and, when I showed him my daughter and explained the situation, he seemed perplexed. Finally, he allowed only me to get inside and then closed the door firmly on the others' faces. I was told to go to a reception desk where I was informed that we could get a \"pass\" for my daughter by providing documentation about her disability. I hadn't brought along any medical documents because : a) I was not so informed by the museum's official site b) all her medical certificates are written in Greek c) my daughter and I have visited other European museums and we were never asked for any medical documents and d) my daughter's disability is more than obvious.I offered to sign any official statement they wanted but it wouldn't do.I offered to pay for our visit (my daughter and one escort) but there were no tickets available. I admit that the girls at the reception desk were sympathetic but a certain lady, who apparently was the chief, was adamant.It was either the certificate or nothing! Furius, I was driven to the back door which was, once more, practically slammed on my face. Our day was so marred by the incident that we left the site immediatelly without taking a stroll in the gardens as we had planned.By writing this down I want to poin out at the museums' lack of consideration to people with special needs. Disability is not a choice. Nobody asks for special favours. Politeness, delicacy and flexibility is all that is required!"

And you don't have to buy tickets through the tourist trap agencies that charge you way more than you need to pay. We got tickets through our hotel the day before.The collection is in general pretty interesting, but the multiple Bernini sculptures are fabulous and alone worth the visit.

We were staying 5 minutes from the Borghese Gallery. I had read about it before we went and knew to book and buy our tickets before we left the US. That process was very easy. We walked around the Villa Borghese(park) for a while before we were scheduled to go in. It is important to note that you must check all bags before you go in which is free, but before you go I would make sure that anything of importance is not left in your bags. I am sure the staff were trustworthy, but I think that is wise to not leave money etc in your bag. The Gallery is housed in the once home of Cardinal Borghese who became Pope. The building alone is gorgeous and the art work inside just stunning. There are some works by Bernini and Raphael in there. I am not up on art so much, but I enjoyed seeing all of it. It isn't that big of a museum and you have a limited time to see it, but the time is plentiful. The kids seem to like it too. We rented a few headphones to tell us about what we were seeing. The only negative I had was the restroom was not very clean. I am speaking of the one inside the museum. There is one downstairs in the basement where you check your bag that is very clean. It is attended and you have to show your ticket to use it. This is to keep the people who are just in the park from using it I would guess. There are upper levels which aren't clearly marked, but don't miss going up."

The museum only allows a certain number of people in at a time. And, for only a limited amount of time. And, at a certain time. 2. Once you have your reservation and tickets, be sure to be on time as they let in the group. 3. If you want to have more time in the Borghese, I think signing up for a guided tour is the way to go. 4. Because of the limited time, move through the rooms at a purposeful clip. If you can, go to the second floor first and then on to the first floor - to avoid the crowds. 5. There is a nice little cafe and gift shop. Also, there is a little train (not working the day we were there) that will take you around the garden. 6. You have to check in your belongings, but if you ask for a clear plastic bag, you can keep your smaller items with you. Also, there is no flash photography. However, you may take pictures. We checked our cameras and learned this lesson the hard way. 7. There is a very small elevator for wheelchairs and those unable to navigate stairs. But, only two people in the elevator at a time, and one of those people is a museum staff person. 8. I don't know why, but there is NO A/C in the Borghese. Just a few small fans to blow around the hot air. So, plan accordingly. Wearing your new fabulous Italian leather ensemble not recommended. 9. Clean restrooms. Non-smoking."

We learned many things about the work in the gallery, and many others in and around Rome. This tour took about 2.5 hours and cost 200$ plus tip. We felt it was worth every penny and was one of the best attractions/tours we had in Rome. Of course, one will want to bring a bottle of water and wear comfortable walking shoes.

There are plenty of reviewers who have said more so no need to repeat.The picture gallery is also fantastic, with Raphaels, Caravaggio, Titian, and more masters.Beware of the heat if you're using public transit. Also be sure to call and set up a time to visit. The general public cannot just show up since the museum is not large and they want visitors to enjoy walking around without too much of a crowd."

Must pre book tickets otherwise you won't get in. No bags allowed so you can store these while you are there. Many steps to the upper Levels there is a lift for the disabled. There are carts that can be rented at the main gates. There is also a small shop inside for coffee, sandwiches Etc. Hiring earphones is extra at 5 euros. Well worth a visit make sure you take water and hats in extreme hot days."

Because our child was in a wheelchair due to a sprained ankle, we were told to ring the side door connected by a ramp. No one there answered and we had to assist our child down to the gathering area in the basement and carry the wheelchair down the stairs. Before the tour started, an employee asked us to leave our wheelchair in the basement due to the narrowness of the elevator and brought us upstairs to get into a the museum's own wheelchair. This was a nice accommodation, but the problem was he brought us to the SECOND floor, whereas the tour starts on the FIRST floor. We showed him our tour group tickets and where wearing the radio headsets, which should have told him where to drop us off. As the starting time of the tour drew near we didn't see the rest of the tour group and became a bit worried. I asked a staff member and she said the tour will eventually come up here so just wait. Those of you who've visited know that the most interesting parts of the collection are on the first floor, which we weren't aware of at the time. When we started to hear the voice of the tour guide on the radio through the floor, I went down to check it out, and he told me to bring my family down right away so as not to miss out on the most important parts. By the time that I went upstairs, had someone bring us down in the elevator, put my child into another wheelchair, and found the tour group, we've missed almost 30 minutes of the 90 minute tour. At the end of tour, there was about 10 minutes left for us to wonder around before everyone was asked to leave to make way for the next wave of visitors (apparently the visits there are time-blocked for 2 hours), which didn't give us time to catch up on the things missed (not to mention the missed explanations). After spending 50 Euros on tickets for the three of us, plus the taxi fare, and in general planning half our day in Rome around the visit, we feel a bit robbed.When we're about to leave we found that our wheelchair was missing (!), and after searching for it they discovered that it was put into general circulation among the other wheelchairs at the museum, and someone was just about to use it for a patron, which would make it much more difficult to find. Better training or perhaps just more care by the staff would've made our visit less of a debacle. I've been somewhat forewarned by one of the other reviewers who've brought someone in a wheelchair and tried to avoid some of the pitfalls, and still encountered these problems. I won't comment much on the attitudes of the staff, except to say that they appear to be less empathetic than encountered elsewhere in Rome. ------The collection, particularly the Bernini sculptures are unforgettable. Our young tour guide was knowledgeable, humorous, and good at relating historical events and concepts to what we know today to make things instantly understandable. The tour itself (English version) is highly recommended."

It is absolutely breath taking and fine art that just makes you in awe of talent and history captured in so many rooms! We had arrived late on the bus for the minimum 45 mins before our reservation time but got in without issues. You can't bring in any bags or small purse or water so you will need to check in (free). Coat check and reservations persons were very direct and not friendly to us though. Due to 3 long lineups to get your reserved tickets and bag check and audioguide you should try to get there before your reserved time. You get exactly 2 hrs and then security kicks you out to let the next group in. Audioguide was 5\u20ac each and it's worth it to understand the paintings and sculpture. It was wonderful to see all the great pieces of artwork including the famous Sacred and Profane Love by Titian (in the very last room). Some suggest you to go upstairs first in your alloted time so it's not as busy. We took photos of everything (without flash) without problems. A definite must see!!!"

There are so many good museums in Rome that one visit cannot cover all if shorter than a month - but this one you should not miss in your first visit. It is not overwhelming, the reservation system actually benefits all, as it is not overcrowded or policed like the Vatican museums and the Sistine Chapel where the pre booking system does not decrease the crowds. The Western art since the renaissance is here, save the moderns of course - the very best of everything to the extent that a Leonardo is stuck In a corner of the upper floor. That work would probably be the main attraction in any other museum.The internet reservation system is simple and reliable, and there were several options for admission for just the next day when I tried - not like the last supper of Leonardo in Milan that that you have to book months ahead. (Clutch- you need to allow all cookies for the Visa/MC verification)And while it is true that you need to check in all backs you can have your phone and camera and take pictures freely, in contrary that my ticket info was. And going to Villa Borghese anyway is a delightful experience, so I recommend that you reserve ample time to enjoy the park while there."

You have to book at least a day (if not more) in advance, because they strictly limit the number of people allowed inside at any one time. This makes it very pleasant when you eventually get to see the artwork, because it's not wall-to-wall people and you can actually move freely and see things up close.Once you book an entrance time, you are told sternly to arrive at least 20 minutes before your reserved time, so that you can be herded around for those 20 minutes and - of course - directed to the caf\u00e9 and gift shop to spend money while you wait. Also you cannot bring any sort of bag into the gallery, even a tiny clutch purse, so you have to check all your items. For such an elegant and cultured place, they have THE ABSOLUTE RUDEST BRAT working at the bag check. She is a surly young woman with long black hair whose life goal obviously is not to be working at a bag check desk, so she acts as bratty and rude to people as possible. Seriously, the gallery should fire her. (She was working there at 3:00 pm on Friday, July 29th.) I hope the management reads this and does something about her asap."

Advance reservations are necessary and printed vouchers for the reservations made on line will be exchanged at the museum for tickets. It's recommended that visitors be at the museum at least 15 minutes before the beginning of the two-hour time slot in order to exchange vouchers for tickets. BUT: If booking on line, make sure to book through the museum's official web site and read all instructions very carefully. We mistakenly booked through a tour operator whose web site appeared at the top of our Internet search for Borghese Gallery. This web site charged a fee considerably more than the cost of the ticket on the museum's own web site. Further, this tour-operator web site required that we state a desired time of visit and an alternate time. The voucher that we printed out as proof of purchase stated a different time, 11 am, than the 9 am time for which the museum's computers showed our purchase time. Although we arrived at least a 30 minutes before our 11 am voucher time, we underwent considerable and time-consuming hassle to have our admission time changed so that we could enter at 11. The first two people that we encountered at the voucher desk (legitimately) wanted to turn us away without admitting us to the museum. But when we explained our situation, one, nicer, sent us to the person who actually collected tickets. She seemed to undergo somersaults behind the scenes and then engaged in a lengthy, heated discussion in Italian with the initial two voucher people. Eventually, we were told to wait in the ticket-holders line but without tickets. At 11 am, the nice ticket lady allowed us into the museum. We also sadly observed a young woman turned away from the voucher desk because she only had proof of purchase on her cell phone and did not have a printed voucher!"

Our guide placed this on our itinerary and I was very glad that we did visit this gallery. How many amazing pieces of art in paint and sculpture. As I am only able to make stick figures, it is amazing to see the works that these artists made. Bernini's sculptures appear to be living through the \"softness\" and malleability of the marble. The linens on the couch are impressed by the subject reclining on it and the indentations made by someone gripping or holding on to another is astounding.

Bernini did not execute the sculpture by himself; he had significant help from a member of his workshop, Giuliano Finelli, who undertook the sculpture of the details that show Daphne's conversion from human to tree such as the bark and branches, as well as her windswept hair.\""

Get tickets online for everything in Italy: the Vatican, Uffizi Gallery, Academia, Duomo, etc. Don't wait in three-hour lines in the scorching heat when you could be doing more productive things with your time. Furthermore, the Borghese limits its number of daily visitors, which means that tickets can sell out, and if you just show up, you may not be able to even procure a ticket for the next three days. Onto the review. The Borghese Gallery is home to Bernini's most famous statues: David, Apollo and Daphne, Rape of Prosperina, etc. I learned about these works in school, so I was especially excited to see them in real life - they did not disappoint. The statues were magnificent, awe-inspiring, and elegantly displayed. The gallery was well-maintained and rich, and even the rooms themselves were worthy of a museum display. I would highly recommend visiting this gallery - it hardly takes the two hours that one is allotted, and the experience of beholding Bernini's masterpieces is not one I will soon forget."

Another extraordinary piece of marble carving is Bernini's Apollo and Daphnis, she is turning into the shrub as he tries to grasp her, with the tips of her fingers sprouting leaves. The traditional decorative painting of the walls is remarkable and there are two wonderful paintings by Caravaggio. The gallery is in a beautiful settling of the grand alleys of the Borghese Gardens.

I went with an older relative so taking a taxi let us get closer to entrance (5 min flat walk). The gallery is at the top of an enormous park/garden (a bit rundown park), sitting high on a hill. You must go downstairs to check all bags (give yourself time to do this when you arrive and when you leave), so have your wallet and camera pulled out to carry. Limited to 2 hours tour time and they are serious about getting you out, so I recommend reading up on art that is there to be sure you don't miss highlights in all these rooms. There is a small lift if you need it, ask security. Small cafeteria with lots of seating, in basement, and tempting gift shop. We got lunch to go and sat outside. There is a Roman water fountain in the park to refill water bottles. Walking down the park on a hot day to Spanish steps required breaks from the sun, lots of water, but a great views of Rome just before winding down the final path. Maybe 30-45 min walk. You can rent bikes in the park if you wish."

It's difficult to believe that people actually lived in the rooms. The art and sculpture collection is relatively small (for a museum), but is outstanding. I normally skip sculpture rooms in art museums because they normally do not interest me as much as the paintings; however, the sculpture collection at this museum was so good that I liked it better than the paintings. The museum requires timed reservations. I bought mine over the Internet and found the site somewhat difficult to navigate (not terribly use- friendly). There are limited tickets available for each time-slot, and they do sell out, so get your reservations in advance. Transportation to the museum was a bit difficult for me. There are no nearby metro lines, so I had to take a bus. Unfortunately, I could not find a return bus stop, so I had to walk to the nearest metro station. Despite these difficulties, I really enjoyed the museum and would recommend it to art lovers."

This time we came prepared and even had a tour organised. The gallery is no so big that it is overwhelming (hello Uffizi, Louvre) and you get time to enjoy the works. It feels more intimate also because many of the works inhabit spaces intended for the work by the artist and the Borghese family and the gallery was also a home, although a very grand one, and the space and the works reflect the eclectic tastes of the Borghese. My preferences were for the Caravaggios and the Berninis, famous works most people have seen in print, I just never knew they were housed in this rather small gallery."

We went to their office inside and asked for the manager...the office lady was very willing to help us and just asked for identification so that they can make sure we are the people who booked the tickets. After that, the ticket booth person came over and started speaking in Italian about how he wouldn't allow it. He said to us \"you are not allowed to come into my museum.\" - we were shocked with his arrogance, attitude and his inconsiderate way to treat tourist. We said we were here to enjoy art but given their horrible attitude, it is better that we don't. We told them that we came from New York and if you ever stop by the Met museum, not only ticket is optional, the staff is friendly and will always treat everyone with respect. However, that is not the case in Villa Borghese. It is sad to see this side of Italy, probably just this one person's arrogant self ruining many tourists happy time.

The Bernini statues are absolutely amazing-Apollo and Daphne statue is simply breath taking. As they are on the first level near the entrance people quickly gather around them.

This gallery was not on our original list of places to visit as we have younger kids (ages 7 and 10) but we wanted to see the gardens and decided to do the museum tour as well. We are so glad we spent the time in this amazing museum - we all enjoyed the experience and especially the spectacular Bernini sculptures. The gardens are also beautiful - get there in the morning to stroll around or rent bicycles, as we did. You need to book ahead to get tickets as well."

            "review": "Excellent Crowd Control. For the sheer number of high-quality paintings and sculptures in an art collection, this has to be one of the best in the world. And they're all displayed on two floors in a series of small rooms splendid with furniture, mosaics, ceiling paintings, etc.This gallery visit needs planning: you just can't show up and walk in. You book tickets in advance (I bought mine on-line) and are given a 2-hour time slot on a day you choose. If you arrive late, you may not be admitted that day. I saw some late-comers arguing with staff about this. Deal with ticket business first, and then check out the small formal gardens behind the gallery if you get there early. About 10 minutes before your allotted time, walk around to the front of the building and get in the line.The staff has got this system worked out smoothly. The 2 hours you have inside means the rooms aren't packed, so works of art can be admired better. (For example, I could look at Bernini's \"David\" for a good 10-15 minutes with only about 10 other people in the room.) A few minutes before the 2 hours are up, guards begin to direct you out.Most paintings are on the upper floor, and there are some significant ones such as Raphael's tragic \"Deposition\" and Titian's \"Sacred and Profane Love.\" Other highlights on the lower floor are the room of Caravaggio's paintings, Canova's icy sculpture of Pauline Borghese, and several dramatic Bernini sculptures.This is a world-class gallery. 3 hours, not 2, would do it better justice."

The Borghese Gallery is simply a must see if you have any love of art, especially the baroque masterpieces of Bernini and Caravaggio. But be warned. They have changed the booking system. You used to book on the day at the ticket office and they would give you a time slot later in the day. This has worked brilliantly on our previous two visits. Now you have to book on-line in advance - so when we arrived, there was no availability until the day after we would leave Rome. Perhaps this is just a high season blip, but last time it was the same time of year and booking was easy. So. Although I was disappointed, and will be forearmed in the future, I know the delights inside this gallery, especially \"Apollo e Dafne\", one of my favourite objects in the whole world, so I still have to give it five stars."

This gave us just about enough time to see everything. It is advisable to pre-book your tickets online well in advance to avoid disappointment, (especially for Sundays when entry is free) apparently tickets regularly sell out a month in advance and if you just turn up, the next available tickets might only be for the next day. Only small numbers of people are admitted at once to avoid overcrowding inside. I found their admission policy to be quite fair and effective as it made sure everyone had enough time to visit without there being too many people around.We were VERY fortunate to purchase tickets from a seller outside who was selling them at the low price of 10 euros as a tour was just about to start and he had some spare tickets, so you might get lucky like us. Inside is absolutely beautiful, much like the Vatican, the walls and ceilings are covered with beautiful detailed artworks. There are sculptures by Bernini, paintings by Titian and Caravaggio and while we were there in August there was an exhibition of couture dresses that looked like works of art and although they were modern, they blended in well with the rest of the gallery exhibits. An audio guide in English is available and there is a caf\u00e9 located on the ground floor which does a great Irish coffee.I took hundreds of photos but they will never do it justice - this place really has to be seen."

Be aware you need to reserve in advance as there is a limited number of visitors that can enter the gallery at once and visits are set two hours apart from each other. The good thing is there is never too many people inside (as is the case at the Vatican museums) and you can truly appreciate the art pieces. The bad thing is you only have 2 hours to complete your visit. The museum is set in a magnificent park. You can make it a day visit and stroll in the park afterwards."

Then the line to pick up your tickets - it is not clear if you can pick up your pre-booked tickets there or if the line is for anyone buying for that day. It is BOTH.

I would spend all day just admiring the statues by Bernini, but alas there is a 2 hour time limit. Despite that limitation, I had a great time and was able to slowly wander through the entire museum in under 2 hours. The major upside to the time restriction, however, are the crowds, or lack of them to be more accurate. I never had to squeeze through mobs of people or wait to see any of the art.Buy your tickets in advance (we ordered them online) print out the voucher they send you, and then when you arrive, go downstairs to the ticket office and show them your voucher. They'll give you the real tickets then you go upstairs at your specified entrance time, pass through security, and you're in. It sounds difficult and lengthy, but the process was actually quite easy and it really didn't take that long before we were in and admiring the wonderful collection of art."

The great thing about the Borghese Gallery (beside the art!) is that they strictly limit the number of people allowed into the gallery, and limit the amount of time you can spend (2 hours.) So the crowd is manageable and you can actually see the art... and what amazing art it is! We got the audio-guides, which were helpful and added to our appreciation (note: you have to leave an ID as security when you rent your audio-guide.).The Borghese is all about the art... and not so much about the visitors. Almost every staff person we encountered treated us as regrettable inconveniences (or necessary evils.) You cannot take even medium size purses into the gallery, so you have to check all bags ahead of time. Our scheduled ticket time was the last one of the day (5-7pm) and by the time we were done with our audio-tour, the gift shop and the bathrooms had closed for the day (they close at 6:30) and the staff working at the audio-guide stand, the bag check and the ticket window were all visibly chomping at the bit to leave, which contributed to the feeling that they couldn't wait to get rid of us. Seems a bad business model, since we probably would have spent money in the gift shop if given the chance.It is definitely worth the visit, just be forewarned that you may not be greeted with a warm welcome."

Our guide Andy, was extremely knowledgeable about the gallery, sculptures and other works of art that he show us. You must remember that the Gallery only allots 2 hours per tour. So it is no possible to see all of the Gallery. I felt that Andy did an excellent job of showing us the most important works. After we toured the Gallery we then toured the Gardens. This tour is not to be missed!"

This enhances the experience even further. Make sure you buy tickets in advance directly from the gallery which will give you a time slot of two hours.

The crowd management is the key - they only allow a few hundred people in at a time over staggered intervals. Also the English guides are amazing and some of the best quality out of all the tours I've done across various museums in Europe. Our guide this time perfectly balanced the academic analysis of the art with pop culture references to things such as The Simpsons, \"selfies\", and photoshop! The quality of the art itself makes it one of the most outstanding collections in Europe - while the smaller size of the gallery makes it a manageable dose for those overwhelmed by bigger museums like the Louvre. If you see anything in Rome, make it this."

Quite rightly, they control the number of people in the museumat any one time. This allows for a much more pleasurable experience and undoubtedly helps to protect the works of art.But it is worth the effort!! I suggest showing up at your allotted time 15 minutes late---ask in advance if that is OK. This will allow you to miss the initial mad rush. Also do NOT forget tocheck your bags, backpacks, etc. below the entry staircase.They are very efficient---but keep your valuables just in case.The staff is very accommodating. You might want to hire a private guide (the group tours seem a little bulky in the restricted space). It's just a shame that a lot of the original part of the ancient collection was sold off to Napoleon and is now in the Louvre. Nevertheless, if you enjoy sculpture, painting and a very beautiful building, do not hesitate to plan ahead, put in the little extra effort and GO."

In reference to the negative reviews, I must preface my review by saying that we booked tickets several months in advance with a private tour group and went through the museum with a private tour guide. We had tickets for 11:00 and we got lost in the gardens so we ended up going in at 11:15 but I think that was only because of our tour guide's connection with the museum. The timed tickets makes the museum less crowded and allows you to really enjoy the spectacular art that is in the museum. In comparison, the Vatican museum was so hot and crowded that you felt like cattle being herded along the path. The Bernini statues are the most amazing pieces of art I have seen and for them alone the visit was worth it. There are also gorgeous mosaics and a nice selection of Caravaggio paintings as well. The building itself was quite a stunner. I think the museum is definitely worth a trip- just plan to be there very early and make sure to book well in advance. You cannot take any large bags into the museum- there is a free check area and you are given a plastic bag to put your wallet, phone, and water in."

The Gallery is a good 20min walk from the centre so the 5-7pm time slot is a good one. When you arrive, you have to go down stairs to collect your tickets and check your bag - no signs tell you this! They are strict about not letting you in until your time slot. Once inside, it can be overwhelming as everyone goes to the same rooms at the same time, just take your time. We felt there was a lack of information about what we were looking at and probably walked past some of the most amazing art in the world without having a clue! The upstairs picture gallery is limited to 30mins only so make sure you have time for that. The only negative i would say is that the lighting is angled in such a way, you end up with reflections of the spot lights on your photos - odd when you can't use a flash but they can use bright lights!Worth a visit when in Rome."

The Canova and Bernini statues are fabulous, and the palazzo itself is superb, but of the art museums I've seen in Rome I consider this by far the most overrated. The reservation system limits the number of people in the museum, but you'll still be with a crowd of people. The display of art in the Galleria could use work. Either keep the art as it was originally displayed (the surprise effect of Apollo and Daphne is lost) or at least display it in accordance with modern standards. The Hellenistic hermaphrodite statue is displayed half hidden, thus obscuring the whole point. Raphael's Lady with a Unicorn is displayed where both glare and shadow make it hard to see the colors. The staff, moreover, at the Borghese are less than professional. The man at the ticket counter kept asking young women by themselves or with other women if they had boyfriends. The bar serves drinks in glasses with bits of pastry stuck to the inside. Guards made little effort to correct guests touching the less famous statues. Apparently only Berninis need protecting. This museum is resting on its laurels. If you want old masters, go to the Palazzo Barberini or Palazzo Doria Pamphilj. Both will give you similarly fantastic frescoed galleries and more varied collections with 10% of the crowds as at the Borghese. The Palazzo Venezia near the Forum is friendlier and has a sweet little collection. The paintings at the top floor of the Capitoline museum are just as interesting. If you want a nice museum in the Borghese gardens, see the Etruscan art at the serene villa Giulia or the early 20th century sculpture at the free Museo Pietro Canonica. There are plenty of museums just as beautiful and without the hassle and actual harassment of the Borghese. Don't feel bad if the Borghese is sold out. "

They are huge, but there are maps periodically so you can find your way around (and out!). Do not miss the Gallery and the collections of the Borghese family--some of the most incredible sculptures and paintings in Rome. There are ONLY timed entries and they severely limit the number of people who can be in the gallery at any one time--a good thing, so you can actually get close to and see the pieces in the collection. You reserve a day and time on line--my best advice is to do this planning early and base your Rome stay around this, as most places don't require the advance tickets. The website is a bit clunky--I couldn't figure out why I couldn't reserve the day and time I wanted, but realized later that it was because they were sold out for those times--it doesn't really tell you that, but just won't let you reserve them. DO NOT pay for the ticket guarantee, unless you just forget to take your confirmation with you. It's an unnecessary \u20ac4 if you carry the confirmation to the booking. The ticket office is below the Gallery structure--you enter down the stairs below the center Gallery opening. Leave your shopping purchases and backpacks in the hotel as they are strict about not taking those things into the Gallery and the lines at the bag check can be quite long.There is a coffee shop/restaurant in the lower level where you buy tickets, but every time we were there it was very crowded with no place to sit.The building itself complements the collection--an incredible structure. This is a MUST for Rome visitors. It's a nice walk from the center of the city--a bit uphill, but not terribly strenuous, if you are an active walker."

Probably because this gallery is much smaller and not as well known in Taiwan. But when in went in , she was suitably impressed, the Bernini sculptures were wonderful, the roman gladiator mosaics were awesome, the palazzo itself is beautifully maintained, every wall, ceiling is an artwork. \u7269\u8d85\u6240\u503c\uff0c \u7cbe\u54c1\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u54c1\u3002\u9023\u7246\u58c1\u5929\u82b1\u677f\u90fd\u662f\u85dd\u8853\u7684\u7cbe\u83ef\u3002\u96d5\u523b\u54c1\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u4e0d\u53bb\u770b\u592a\u53ef\u60dc\u4e86\u3002\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u63d0\u65e9\u8a02\u7968\u5594\u3002"

It was late in the day and there was no one in the museum so they could have made an exception. The person at the counter said there were 360 people inside, yet we saw no one get out. This is by far the worst we have been treated at a museum where we already had tickets (we had the Roma pass). The person at the counter should be fired immediately based on how she treats customers. Same story at the cafe, very rude staff. Get your reservations in advance and ignore the staff, maybe you'll enjoy your visit."

The setting, palace, was beautiful! You have two hours maximum. You will need every second. The gift shop is small, but nice. Nice books. Be sure to check out the grounds. You can ride a train, bicycle for four or two, Segway, or walk. There is a park, zoo and merry go round. Outdoor food venders. Great, safe place to let the kids run outside.

It was well worth the money because Felix (a history of art graduate) was outstanding - with in-depth knowledge and the ability to answer all manner of questions that occurred as we were looking at the paintings and sculptures. A wonderful collection - the Caravaggio paintings were superb and I was entranced by the Bernini sculptures as Felix pointed out the key details such as texture of the marble on the statue of Apollo and Daphne. A genuine must, if you are visiting Rome."

We started upstairs first to see Caravaggio,s paintings which were intriguing. The majority of the people started downstairs on the main level. The upstairs took us about half an hour, then we headed down for the last hour and a half of our allotted time. The nice thing about doing it that way is by the time you get to the downstairs rooms you have many of them all to your self. What an amazing experience to be alone with the Bernini masterpieces. Truly a surreal moment. We loved the David, Apollo and Daphne and the Pluto and Persephone sculptures. Simply indescribable. We were able to savour the works without much distraction. The gallery is beautifully decorated. We also used the audio guide which I would recommend. We found a few of the employees not too friendly but others were over the top helpful. The park was beautiful and we enjoyed the green space after walking Rome city streets for 4 days. Please do the route we did you will enjoy this much more without the crowds."

The main floor-what to look at first in each room? The statues--yes, of course. The paintings--yes, absolutely. The floors, often with interesting mosaics-can't miss those. But then, look up. the ceilings are beautiful and stories in and of themselves. The second floor has amazing paintings (some statuary, mostly paintings) that tend to get lost in the masterpieces on the ground (first) floor. It's a tragedy that one only has 2 hours, but given the size of the gallery, and how long many people could stay, I understand it. I want to go back and spend more time in each room to really see each piece. On the ceilings, don't overlook the non-focal paintings. I forget which room, but one of them has two winged lion women 'supporting' each 'main' mural. They all have different facial expressions, but one of each looks calm, informed, sometimes smug; and one looks like she's saying 'whaaaaa?'. even though the exact expression varies The gallery is also in a very large park (the grounds of the villa, originally) which is beautiful to walk around in.

How is this place not on every visitor's lips as a top destination? The gallery had some of the most viceral art I have ever experienced. It is singlehandedly turning me into an individual with almost no appreciation for art to someone who will actively read up on art styling and history. The fact that only a certain number is allowed in each 2 hours controls the crowd quite effectively and allowed you the space to fully experience each of the pieces. The only comment I have is we didn't feel the 2 hours was enough time. I would happily spend an hour in there if allowed. Oh, also the audio tour is worth every cent.

Be thinking in terms of booking your visit a week or more in advance especially with summer tourism.

First of all, definitely put this on your to do list in Rome...the works of art are incredible.On the other hand, the staff is horrendous....be forewarned!We were there in early May, having purchased advance tickets, in plenty of time for our appointed time to visit. When we got our tickets at will call (front desk), I was informed that my backpack needed to be checked. My wife asked if her purse needed to be checked, and was told that it was not necessary. So we went and checked my backpack in, and went to their very small cafe. I ordered a very dry sandwich and drink, and my wife ordered a salad that came out completely different than what she ordered. We ate it anyway, taking our time until our admittance time, when we joined a now growing line to get in. That line went thru quickly, but when we got to the ticket taker, he said my wife's purse needed to be checked. We told him the front desk said it was OK, but he wouldn't budge. By now, the line to check a bag was very long, so we had to put up with that and then gained entry.We put on the audio tour devices. Mine was working, but my wife told the guy at the desk that hers was not working well. They made an adjustment and got it working. It died during the second exhibit room, after we had climbed a long set of stairs and hallways to start the tour. I told her to use mine and we'd get a refund from the desk when we leave, instead of negotiating the long set of stairs.When we returned I told the manager there that the unit had died shortly after we started. He said it is not normal and that we should have brought it back. I told him getting into the exhibits is difficult, and we did not want to go thru that to trade it in. He very reluctantly gave me my 5 euros back, was definitely upset, and said \"next time we don't do this\". I told him don't worry, this is likely the only visit in our lives.We then decided to make use of the rest rooms before leaving. These were in marginal shape, to put it kindly. When my wife left the rest room and approached the cafe, there was a German tourist in front of her who proceeded to vomit...fortunately not on her. She pointed out the Men's rest room to him, and then went to the ticket counter to report that the man just vomited in the hall between the cafe and the rest room. The lady there said it was not her area and to go tell someone by the cafe. My wife said \"I am just informing you...YOU tell your staff over there.I am a guest here\" and we left. It is a shame that such a wonderful gallery is run by a careless staff...the three stars are strictly for the art."

I checked the tour at 11:10 and it was available. 11 AM happened to be very popular as I found out at the bus stop as well. Rick Steves recommended Bus 910 from Termini to the museum. When I got to Termini, the bus just pull in. There were three times the number of people waiting than the bus can hold. I immediately took the metro from there to the museum. We had to walk through the length of the park in order to get to the museum. Signage was very poor after about 10 minutes into the walk. I presented the reservation number to claim my ticket but the woman said I had the financial transaction number instead of the reservation number. She rudely told me again in slow English and asked me to retrieve my email using their public wifi. I frantically pull out my pad device and tried to retrieve the Borghese email. Unfortunately, the public wifi was so slow and I was never able to even get into my email site. I approached the other receptionist and asked him if he can search me by my name. He asked for an ID and in less than 10 seconds, I had my tickets.The docent was very knowledgeable. She explained what intricacies to look for in a painting or in a sculpture and what might be in the minds of the artists. She guided us around a sculpture to point out what we can expect from a certain angle. She really made this one and a half hour extremely enjoyable.After our tour, I wanted to stay longer to look at items that she did not use for her tour. However, time was up."

When we were there on 26.5.16 the signs at the desk clearly showed no tickets available until 31.5.16. They were turning people away.On arriving at the Gallery (a splendid looking building in itself), make your way to the small door at ground floor front and down the steps. This is the location of the ticket desk, the bag store, the restaurant, the toilets and audio tour desk.You will not get in with rucksacks, camera bags, etc. but there is a free ticketed cloakroom where you can leave your bags in safety. You can take cameras in with you despite what it says on the internet pre bought tickets. I will repeat this because I didn't believe that you could even up to arriving there. Photography is permitted. Flash photography is forbidden.The gallery is divided into two floors. The first floor contains fabulous sculptures by a multitude of sculptors including the world renowned Bernini. There are also the better paintings by the likes of Caravaggio and Raphael. I would stress at this point the advantage of paying about 5 euros per person for the audio guide. The descriptions of the pieces including how and where they had first been displayed certainly breathed more life into the tour. The quality of the paintings and the sculptures from over 400 years ago is beyond belief.The upper floor which houses more paintings is accessed by going down a floor and then back up again via a different door.Only about 360 people are allowed into the gallery at any time and you will have a 2 hour time slot to view the exhibitions before you are asked to leave and the next 360 will enter. So use your time fully and revisit the sculptures to stand and gaze in complete admiration of the men who made them."

It's incredible how such detail, movement and expression can be communicated with a piece of marble. A real treat. The ceiling of the entrance hall is incredible too. We reserved our tickets online as I'd read reviews that said tickets are always sold out and it's true! We visited on a Saturday and they were sold out until the following Tuesday. We reserved the 9-11 am slot as you only get 2 hours and it worked well as we were the first group of the day, so checking in our bags, getting audio guides and exchanging our voucher for tickets was relatively easy as only one group was there. When we came out at 11am it was very busy as the outgoing and incoming group was there. As the time you have there is limited, I'd advise going for the first slot of the day and getting there 20 mins early to get everything you need ready to start at 9am. You won't want to waste a second! We also found that by the time we got to the third room it was packed, so we went to the second floor and skipped ahead in the audio guide - easy to do as it's just typing in numbers - so that by the time we returned to the first floor it was much less crowded. This meant we could enjoy the most impressive sculptures in relative peace. I'd advise managing your time well as there is too much to see in 2 hours so if there's something you especially want to see then make sure you leave time. We found that the audio guide - which is well worth the money so you know what you are looking at - lasted about 1 hour and 40 minutes, with walking between rooms, so then we used the remaining 20 to just soak it all in and revisit our favourite works. I'm not an art buff but I have to say I was blown away by the incredible works of art."

The setting is beautiful, but the Bernini sculptures are what make the visit worth it. However, don't miss the Roman mosaics on the floor of the grad entrance hall as well. Even if you are not a huge art enthusiast, you will be impressed. Best of all, the strict limits on admission mean that you can enjoy the ambiance without lots of noise and pushing (even on the weekend!). And, if for some reason you still don't enjoy it, you have to leave after 2 hours so it will be over quickly. Do rent the audio guide! Sometimes it is hard to find out what commentary goes with which room, but it is worth it. The explanations focus on content and historical context which is good if you are not so interested in technique. Also, I found the guide helped me pace the visit well. By only spending time on one or two pieces per room I was able to make it through in the time allotted, otherwise I would have missed a lot of interesting things at the end. Logistics: You need to call and reserve at least a week in advance, even 4-5 days before is too late. The telephone reservation process is easy, the line to pick up the tickets wasn't too bad, but the lines to rent the audio guide and check bags (they are very strict about this) were extremely long. The line for the bathroom was also very long- wait until you are inside and use the one between the 2 floors of the exhibit. The park outside is very nice for a picnic, and there are lots of bicycle car things you can rent that would be fun with kids."

Every inch of it is decorated in exquisite classical, neoclassical, and a few other styles with different colors of marble, paintings, and ceiling frescos. There are some very famous artists works including among the paintings including Botticelli, Titiani, Caravaggio. There are many statues and busts from the Roman period. They only let 250 people in at a time, and they kick everybody out 2 hours later before they let the next group in, so pace yourself accordingly. There are two floors and many rooms on each floor. YOU MUST HAVE A RESERVATION TO GET IN.I can't recommend this museum strongly enough!"

The attraction office is very good about spacing the groups and managing the number of folks going into the Borghese Palace Museum.

It can be appreciated much more if you know what you are looking at. Many companies offer walking tours here, so plan ahead and book the ticket. The surrounding gardens and park area are quite lovely to stroll before or after the visit. The gallery is well located and within walking distance of central Rome area.

The first time I saw them I thought \"I didn't know you could do that with marble\" and they instantly became the highlight of my Rome trip. Re-viewing them years later I cannot repeat the shock, but the sculptures still amaze, as you remember when they were done - when sculptures were just dull busts, or people sitting or statically standing. Bernini was so young and his sculptures are so dynamic; the contrast between an image we all know, Michelangelo's David (just standing there, naked, with his small willy), and Bernini's David, a cunning absolutely determined, coiled-up spring about to kill the giant with his shepherd's home-made rope sling, couldn't be greater. Such a simple, strong image, while, if you approach it right, his Apollo and Daphne stuns you: as you walk round it the image completely changes from one person to two people, to two people in a very different relationship, one of whom is transforming in front of your eyes. You must have a guide - either the standard audio or, better still, a live guide who will physically place you in the right spots to appreciate the story and the artistry. The leaves in her hair and the bark on her skin take your breath away, as you remember they are made of marble and were carved with a hand-held chisel.It's absolutely ESSENTIAL TO BOOK ONLINE BEFORE YOU COME, and you get plenty of space and time to appreciate these masterpieces - unlike the Vatican museum where they let in far too many people.WARNING: Despite the most welcome restricted number of visitors THE LAVATORIES ARE PLAINLY INADEQUATE FOR THE NUMBERS OF VISITORS. There are only two lavatories before entering and one in the galleries, for the hundreds of each gender in the Gallery, and you're there for a two-hour time slot. Two of the three weren't working on the day we visited, so women were having to queue up to visit the men's! The authorities might say this was an exceptional day, but, looking at those lavatories, I don't believe that. Go before you enter the grounds, view just a few of the many quite interesting paintings on the top floor, and then go downstairs and give yourself an hour with four of the most beautiful marble sculptures in the world."

There is no better guide to human history than that provided by art and no better guide to the art of Rome than Alwaysrome's Anna who took us through the Museum and Gallery of the famous Borghese collection, housed in the spectacular rooms of he Vila Borghese situated in Rome's most beautiful parkland.Where other guides on other tours are always keen to rush you to the best spot to take a quick glance and a snapshot of a famous piece before moving to the next room, Anna was intent on imparting a sense of what's important about the work, the context in which it was made and to draw our attention to the artistry at the heart of each piece that she'd selected for us to focus on.Anna's technical and historical knowledge was impecable to the point where we felt we'd achieved a minor qualification in art history by the end, but what was really most valuable was the sense of being there in the incredible prescence of the magnificent works of art that told the story of not only the history of Rome but he history of human society. This is the kind of tour that makes coming to Rome not only an unforgettable experience but one that makes us a better person.Sent from my iPad"

The guide took us through the first level but then finished at 10.35am and just told us to climb to the top floor and check it out.I'd have appreciated a couple more minutes (like, until the end of the slot allotted) to be taken to the top floor's most notable pieces.The ticket is kind of expensive compared to other museums and you've got to book early or you won't get in.If you go for the guided tour, well, your mileage may vary."

Once you arrive for your reservation time, you can pick up for 5.00e a hand held that explains what you are seeing room by room( well worth it). The sculptures on the 1st floor by Bernini nust be seen to be believed. He makes finger indentures in flesh where the hand is resting on a leg or body. There is a man on horse falling off in 3D above a doorway. The paintings are great but the sculptures are amazing.

Aside from the initial confusion, we were enchanted by the Gallery and can't imagine another visit to Rome without revisiting. The audio guide is excellent and well worth the money. And if you want to make the best use of your 2 hours, head first to the paintings on the second floor before turning your attention to the sculptures. two hours didn't seem like enough time to appreciate everything that was there, but because of the timed tickets, the gallery never felt overcrowded. A stroll through the grounds afterwards is also lovely. Highly recommend."

Just book on-line on the Borghese website at least a month before you visit, as should you book the Colosseum tour and the Vatican, no need to queue if you book before you travel."

We hadn't planned to tour the gallery, we had just accompanied others in our party who were going on a Segway trip round the park that started outside. It was before 10am, teeming with rain and early in the season so we thought we could spend a pleasant hour or so at this famous attraction, however we were informed that there were no tickets available for that day. Fair enough, guide books do say booking in advance is advisable. Nevertheless we decided to have breakfast in the cafe and to buy some souvenirs from the gift shop in the hope that the rain would have eased off in the meantime. In the cafe I was astonished at the way the cashier was dealing with an English couple in the queue in front of me. The lady had ordered and paid for a coke (it was one of those systems where you have to order and pay before taking your receipt to another area where they fill your order) but then decided she also wanted an ice tea. The cashier, chatting to another member of staff, then tried to charge her for two drinks. She tried every way she could think of to explain that she had already paid for the coke and should only have to pay for the additional iced tea but was met with cold indifference and repeated demands for \"5\u20ac\". She was flustered, upset and embarrassed for holding up the queue but when she suddenly remembered the receipt (proof that she had, indeed, paid for the coke) she received no apology whatsoever from the cashier who acted as if the whole incident were due to her stupidity! After eating, I decided to go to the toilet before browsing the gift shop but was met by an attendant who refused me entry on the grounds that I had no ticket for the gallery. I explained I had no ticket because there weren't any available but I had spent money in the cafe and was about to spend more in the shop but she, literally, screamed at me, saying if I had been in the cafe where was my receipt. Of course I didn't have it since I had handed it in at the counter. If I had known that it was also my entry to the toilet I would have treated it with the reverence it deserved! I complained at the ticket desk but the girl there refused to let me speak, she just kept shouting that these were the rules again and again. Rome is great; it is filled with amazing sights and experiences don't waste a moment of your time at the Galleria Borghese."

The Rape of Lucretia and Apollo and Daphne are pairless sculptures that capture your imagination and make you wonder how such perfection can exist! Make sure you buy tickets on line in advance of your visit; if not, you will likely miss this fabulous gallery."

The audio guide is so-so: it tends to have long descriptions about an entire room, so although it's interesting, it's not terribly helpful while you are there. (It also lasts ~90 minutes, which doesn't give you much time for looking around). But the collection is stunning, and so is the environment."

Having read reviews suggesting it was imperative to book ahead but you may be lucky if you just pop in, we called in around 2pm and got tickets for the 3pm session. Entry is every 2 hours from 9am to 5pm and apparently limited to 200 people per session. Tickets \u20ac11/adult and \u20ac5 for the audio guide. It is fair to say that organised chaos reigns in the 20 minutes leading up to the entry times with people milling about not sure which queue to join to check in bags and buy audio guides. This, coupled with the last of the previous visitors returning audio guides and collecting bags, makes for a very confusing time. Some staff were quite off hand which was disappointing. The collection itself is brilliant. Cardinal Borghese started something quite unique and his legacy continued through subsequent generations. Bernini's sculptures are exquisite and the gallery itself is beautiful to see.It was disappointing that the secret gardens are currently in a state of disrepair and the parterre garden looked very unloved. The Villa and its gardens are meant to be viewed as a whole so hopefully the gardens will get some attention soon.Highly recommend this gallery if you are prepared for the chaos at the beginning. Assistance for the disabled can be organised. The cafe serves excellent coffee and light meals at good prices but can be understaffed at the busy times."

A lady in the queue had a Roma Pass, but she was advised that she still had to reserve her tickets to gain free entry. So glad we booked, the paintings & sculptures are amazing. Bernini, Caravaggio, Rubens & much more. Even if you don't book for the Gallery the park is lovely & free to Walk around. They have segways & cycles for hire. Tip to get there - from Spanish Steps take the Spagna Metro & follow the signs for Borghese Villa, you don't actually get on a train, you just take the escalators & moving walkways to get to the Borghese exit - about 10 minute walk. Also even though you have to check you bag in you can take your camera in to take photos."

If we had been bleeding to death they probably would of asked us to not bleed on their fine marble floors and asked us to leave. Not only that, they say you have 2 hours in the museum but ask you to leave 15 minutes before your time is up and lock the bathrooms so you can't even relieve yourself. Mussolini would be proud.

We then spent a couple of hours walking the gardens and grounds. This is called the 'Lungs of Rome' and it's vast. There is a little train that goes around for those who don't want to walk and also little double bicycles which you pedal around.

You are limited to a visit of two hours and this is vigorously enforced by the staff, I felt rushed with that time limit. I would suggest that you research the collection ahead of time and decide what works are most important to you. Another suggestion is to go upstairs first to see the painting collection while most of the other visitors are downstairs looking at the sculpture. Then you can go downstairs while they have come upstairs, And after visiting the Gallery spend some time in the large park surrounding it. It is one of Rome's most beautiful green spaces."

But, we think they are letting in many more people than before, and more than they can effectively handle. Dirty toilets, no paper, one person to change your voucher to admission tickets - so a long line, and a long line to check bags (mandatory). You must book tickets minimally one week in advance - you can't just walk up and expect to get in. We booked a month in advance and still had to be flexible with date and entry time. Having seen it twice (and loved the art), don't think we'll go back anytime soon. Too much of a hassle."

A beautiful collection of works in and amazing setting, and absolutely worth the navigating you will need to do to get into the place.First, tickets are usually bought on line. The first oddity is that when you choose an available date and time slot, you will be prompted to \"choose your seats\", like you are in a theatre. There are no seats, as you are merely lining up to access the exhibit.You will get a confirmation of the booking by email...make sure you print this and bring it with you.It is recommended that you show up 1 hour before your time, which is good advice, as the steps to gain entry are poorly designed and time consuming1. Line up to get your actual tickets2. Line up to rent the audio guides3. Line up to check your backpacks and purses (very strict)4. Line up to enter the museum/gallery...which is outside the portico. Not sure what the plan is if it is raining.Once inside, you have two hours to tour. And they aren't kidding. At 10 minutes to the two hour mark, you are asked to leave the premises. You will then join the throng to collect your checked backpacks.It is suggested you pace your touring. They indicate the tour of the upper painting gallery should be limited to 30 minutes, which leaves 90 minutes for the more art rich first floor. I would suggest you move along through the galleries on the lower floor with some briskness, and then return to dwell on favourites if time allows.You really need about 2.5-3 hours to do this gallery justice, but as it stands, you need to keep an eye on your time."

The explanations are invaluable and yet, the tour is completely overwhelming. \"Sensory overload\" is all I can say. Murals, statues, paintings beyond the imagination. A good idea would be to review online available resources to acquaint yourself with the gallery.Be prepared to climb stairs unless you can squeeze into a tiny, circular elevator.The art is really something you have to see to believe; quite over-the-top for my tastes.

Tickets sell out sometimes weeks in advance, so it makes it seem that this is a must see while in Rome. The gallery itself is quite small, with two floors (statues on the first floor and paintings on the second). When you book you get a 2 hour window and depending on how much time you spend looking at each piece, this should be more than enough to see everything. If you happen to get tickets then it is a nice gallery to see in Rome, but if they are not available do not feel like you are missing something major! Definitely check out the Vatican museum if you only have limited time available."

Two hours is about enough time for you to enjoy this without getting artistic indigestion!

From the bus stop at the Barberini metro stop (RED LINE AND THE SAME STOP WHICH IS FOR THE TREVI FOUNTAIN) take the Bus number 61 towards Villa Borghese. However do not make the mistake (which I had made) to travel to Villa Borghese. You need to get off the bus much earlier at S.PALO DEL BRASILE. This is two stops from Barberini amd takes less than 5 minutes to reach there.As you get off the bus, you will see a gate to a massive garden on the same side. Look for the sign to Borghese gallery.From here it is a straight path which is about 300-400 meters long that leads to the Gallery.Very close to the gate there is a Cine Borghese and this is NOT THE GALLERY although you see the pic of that on the website.The number 61 bus runs at about one per 20 minutes."

The staff is nice enough, but given that the Borghese Gallery limits the number of persons and only takes reservations, you would think they would have some experience with crowds. In our reservation was a group of at least 50 teenagers who had no respect for anyone or anything around them. They completely dominated the bag check-in, and almost made my husband and I late for our reservation. When you are only given 2 hours, every minute counts. I was afraid the entire time that the staff would have misplaced my purse, since it got scooped up with the teenager's bajillion items. (Luckily it didn't). They were loud, and their tour guides were loud which especially sucked in the echo-prone rooms. Until we figured out a way to lose them (we just waited until they were many rooms ahead of us) they were a giant pain. But ultimately, when you have the room almost to yourself, you can really appreciate the sculpture. Truly, Bernini was a master and his works will change your life."

The artwork, particularly the sculpture is stunning. The building interior is as lavish display of wealth as you will find.While I enjoyed the art, I was also offended that all of the wealth on display was from the owner being the Cardinal-Nephew. The nephew of the pope having been given a title and almost unlimited church funds to use for his own pleasure. But that gives it an historical story too. It's definitely worth seeing both for the art and to understand what it meant to be a high ranking clergy in the Catholic Church at the time."

The Borghese gallery is one of the finest examples of baroque taste to be seen anywhere in the world.The beauty of its sophisticated interiors, the sumtuosity of its marbles are quite literally staggering. This was party villa, a place to have fun, to entertain and to show ones guests a good time, while enjoying the freshness of its gardens.The collection houses the largest collection of Caravaggio's in the world, 6 in fact, as well as masterpieces by Raffaelo, and arguably the greatest baroque sculpture to be seen anywhere in the world. Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Rape of Proserpina, carved out of a single block of marble, it gives life to man's carnal desires. This is exemplified by the way the sculptor sinks Pluto's hand into the soft flesh of Proserpina thigh.There are two many paintings and sculptures of all periods to go over them one by one. But what i would like you to come away with from this visit, is a sense of awe of the whole. It's a miracle that this Cardinals collection and this building are still standing together after more than 400 years of turbulent history."

Our lovely guide was very knowledgeable and gave us a fascinating history of some of the key pieces in the collection.Sadly, your ticket only entitles your to a 2-hour visit of the museum; our guided tour took an hour and a half, which gave us a bit of time after the tour to explore in details the various sculptures and paintings in the museum.Please note, you will need to allow yourself *plenty* of time (30-45 minutes) before your tour to pick up your ticket, get your audio equipment and check-in all your personal belongings - there are no bags allowed in the museum (not even handbags, purses etc.). Cameras are allowed, though some rooms have a no flash rule.If the weather is nice (or even if it's not) I recommend you take a stroll through the lovely parks surrounding the museum - you could hire a bike or just sit on a bench and people watch. You may wish to take a lovely, leisurely stroll across to Piazza del Popolo and perhaps have lunch/dinner around there (a word of warning: if you choose a restaurant with a view of the Piazza, be prepared to pay for it; it'll be included as a service charge in your final bill)."

Leave plenty of time to get here; if you enter Villa Borghese gardens from Piazza Del Popolo then the museum is the other side of the park. You will need to check in all bags (including handbags) before entering the gallery The Bernini sculptures are breathtaking and worth the admission fee in themselves. A guided tour or audio tour would add much more detail to what you are seeing, We didn't have a guided tour but heard what some of the guides were explaining.The building is amazing and the gardens surrounding the Gallery are a lovely peaceful oasis just a few minutes walk from the hustle of the main tourist traps in Rome."

Clearly, museum management does not care about people traveling long distances to come here.

For art laymen such as ourselves, we highly benefitted from that purchase. The museum tour takes 2 hours and is concise enough that it doesn't overwhelm you with art, unlike the capitaloni Museum which will take you at least 2 days to complete. This museum displays art by Bernini (master of baroque), Caravvagio and Raphael (the masters of canvas) and lovely mosaics on the floor from the Roman era.

It is located in a park located on one of the hills of Rome and has a gorgeous garden setting. The gallery itself is decorated with sumptuous frescoes and drips with marble and baroque details. The artwork housed within the gallery is an astounding collection of paintings,sculptures and mosaics. The highlight of this collection are several astonishingly beautifully baroque marble sculpture masterpieces by Gian Lorenzo Bernini; specifically \"Pluto and Persephone\" which magically appears to transform hard marble into yielding flesh,\" David\" (not to be confused with Michelangelo's David, and \"Apollo and Daphne\"; a work of such skill and delicacy it takes one's breath away. Be advised, ticket reservations are a must. This museum only allow 200 visitors per time slot and thus is sold out days (or even weeks In the high season)in advance. Also, one is limited to a two hour visit until the next shift of visitors arrive. "

With the exception of one of the bag checkers, who was very friendly, all the staff were either downright rude or just plain cold and unfriendly. Not a good start to the experience. But once inside, the art made up for the staff. Such magnificent pieces! The statues are outstanding, and don't miss the upstairs gallery, with beautiful paintings. I think the staff could avoid half the \"trouble\" of having to interact with people if they more clearly stated the routine, i.e. better signage about checking in the bags and what is allowed inside. The ratty sign on the wall shows that you are not to bring in cameras and phones, but this is not true."

I had to book at least 8-9 days in advance for a guided tour to be available, so keep this in mind for planning ahead. Yes it cost about ~5-10 euros more but it was definitely worth it. The guide was clearly an academic who had not only studied these artists and artworks in depth but also had a genuine passion for them, and having him explain the different aspects of the works and the circumstances surrounding their composition made this one of my best art gallery experiences ever. If you're going to 'splurge' on a guided tour in only one art gallery in Rome, do it in this one. This gallery is like walking into the Uffizi and having someone tell you \"we've put all the best stuff in the first 6 rooms, so go to them first\" - a small gallery, but floor to ceiling packed with masterpieces. Do yourself a favour and go here when you're in Rome!"

Bernini's work clearly was inspired by the detail and anatomy of Michelangelo's David, but he evolves it even further with sculptures in movement. You will also appreciate a waxy look the marble is given that creates life-like \"flesh\". The sculptures are truly amazing. There are also portraits done by the famous painter, Caravaggio, but I think the Bernini art is the highlight. Note: Be on time for your ticke time as they are allot only 2 hours for your tour."

The Borghese Gallery contains an outstanding sculpture collection, especially the pieces by Bernini, and is housed in the former Villa Borghese, worth seeing on its own for the amazing decorations. The audio guide (not included in the ticket price but worth the additional cost) does a great job of providing historical context and helping you better appreciate the art. After the Vatican and the Colosseum, this was one of our favorite sites in Rome. You must book tickets in advance; make sure you use the official site so you don't pay any unnecessary additional fees through third party sites. Tickets are 11 Euros per adult (plus 5 Euros for the audioguide, which you can't purchase in advance). You book for a two-hour time slot and cannot stay any longer, so budget your time inside carefully. All bags, purses, and umbrellas must be checked, regardless of size, but you can take photos without flash, so you can keep your camera and cellphone. If you want to rent an audioguide, make sure you keep a drivers license that you can give them in exchange (they won't accept a passport)."

Many people were offering money by the gate to get tickets because they did not plan ahead. Be sure to plan a walk through the garden afterward. We ate in the small cafeteria afterward and though crowded, the food was okay. Arrive early, the lines get long for coat and bag check as the time gets closer. The first floor rooms are large so the order you enter doesn't mean much. I know some travel to the second floor with the paintings, etc. first to avoid the crowds, but be sure to leave time for the first, as it was my favorite, and the audio tour sets are a must if you want to understand anything you see. If you walk, the gardens are close to the Marriott in Rome, the gallery at the furthest end. Enjoy. I think this may have been my favorite site in Rome."

My wife called the museum booking office directly and we were able to book an 11 am tour with an English speaking guide. There is so much to see that we would have missed a great deal without the guide. The sculpture and art work is stunning. Fortunately, they restrict the number of entrants, and the length of visits, so one has time and space to truly appreciate the masterpieces. This museum was one of the highlights of our Rome visit."

We took a guided tour which we internet pre-booked and the tour took around 90 minutes. We had a lovely guide (not sure of her name but it could be Dr Maria something). She is obviously a big fan of the sculptor Bernini, and her enthusiasm was infectious, she went into great detail about the pieces on display, which are stunning, and the information she gave us really made the whole tour a delight. So i definitely recommend a guided tour. The highlight of our visit were the Bernini sculptures, but there are also some wonderful Caravaggio paintings which are also a highlight.And to top off a lovely visit, we then spent a couple of hours in the gardens, enjoying the sun."

The excellent audio-guide is a must to get the most out of the strict two-hour time limit and to hear some of the stories behind the collection. The booking process is annoying but does ensure that crowds are kept to a manageable level. The only negative aspect of the visit was the rudeness and arrogance of the staff, from the ticket office to the audio-guide desk, to the cafeteria! Definitely a must-see, if only to gaze on the genius of Bernini's beautiful sculptures. Make sure you spend some time in the parkland surrounding the Gallery while you are there. We counted 11 different ways of getting around the park while we were 'people-watching' on a perfect spring Saturday, including hired bicycles, pedal cars and segways."

The Borghese Gallery is more than a collection of artworks - it is an entire experience of the excesses of the wealthy and powerful, and a catalogue of the nepotism and corruption of the church, as well as a symbol of later dynasties (including Napoleon's sister).What made this gallery amazing was reading about the history of the palace as I walked through, the people who walked the corridors and lived, visited and partied in the rooms. Although many of the original works that were once housed here are now in the Louvre, their removal and replacement is itself intriguing, and part of the history of this gallery.If you're travelling to Rome for more than a day, this is not an attraction to be missed."

Absolutely amazing place, don't forget to look up at the ceilings as the frescos were also breathtaking - I found that the sculptures and paintings were so wonderful and the setting in the villa made you forget you are in a museum. My husband who doesnt normally appreciate museums also really loved this visit - so much to see and only 2 hours - could have spent all day here. Enjoy the park afterwards. We took the 910 bus from outside the Termini (train Station) which dropped us off at the park gates. We bought Roma passes and used this as one of our 'free museums' together with the Colloseum - just remember to book your timed entry."

Especially notable to us were the statues by Bernini \u2013 Pauline Bonaparte and Daphne and Apollo, as well as the paintings by Carravagio. Don't miss this Gallery, and make sure to walk around the beautiful gardens surrounding it (the Villa Borghese) after or before your visit to the gallery.

One of Bernini's sculptures as a 12-year-old! Masterpieces by Raphael, Titian and Caravaggio. Gotta see this place.This is off peak, so we were able to reserve weekend spots online with just 2 days advance notice. On peak, think about booking 1-2 weeks beforehand. Go with a touring plan. Speed up your tour by doing the second floor FIRST. Less crowded that way. We took Rick Steves' book along on our tablet to winnow the field down and used the audio guides for the rest that interested us. We finished the whole museum with 20 minutes to spare, so no lines to pick up our bags. Avoid the crush to check bags/backpacks by arriving at least 30 minutes before your scheduled time.It's worth noting that they have an exceptional cafeteria. Really good snacks, sandwiches and wonderful espresso drinks for reasonable prices. Terrible sit down area though. Tiny and jam packed. If the weather is good, think about taking your snack outside to eat in the surrounding villa gardens.Highly Recommended."

The audio guides can only be hired with cash ( no cards, splendid, welcome to the 21st century).Once you're in, however - great art - lots of Bernini sculptures, and plenty of paintings of course. When you leave the Borghese gallery you also need to queue again - only 5 mins in our case - to retrieve your bag ( almost funny).Advice - don't take a bag ( avoid 2 queues) and do take cash ( for audio guide). In my opinion, if you had to choose, you get a lot more bangs for your buck ( in terms of time, effort & cash spent) at the well-organised and obscenely well-stocked Vatican museums."

We'd booked for 11am and all that day's tickets had gone!From the outside its a very grand baroque palace, but once one is inside it certainly has the \"wow\" factor - it's outstanding!Each room is absolutely beautiful with incredible statues by the likes of Bernini, centrally positioned, with others dotted around the room which is also festooned with the most amazing of paintings by Caravaggio amongst many!Bernini's David is there, but of course one can only think of Michelangelo's David in comparison.The Caravaggio's are incredible and a must see in themselves!There were too many paintings of religious content for our taste, but if that's your thing then you won't be disappointed.I wouldn't waste your time going to the cafeteria- it's overpriced for what they offer; the staff are rude and unfriendly - more interested in chewing coffee beans, talking to one another, or looking at their paperwork- rather than serve their queuing customers! Totally letting the Gallery down!"

The entrance is in the basement, so enter through a portico at the front of the building and at the bottom. If you go upstairs you won't get in) You MUST relinquish your backpacks and purses and there is no coat check. We tried the suggestion of going upstairs to see the paintings first, then downstairs to the sculptures to avoid the crowds, but that doesn't work anymore. Everyone has to see the paintings first. What is really remarkable is the gallery itself. The rooms are fantastically ornamental and you can imagine being a Borghese princess."

Yes it is a beautiful place, yes there are some great great works in the museum but there where a few things that made it less. The staff at the coffee bar was just rude, the girl at the cash desk was making a phone call in stead of helping us, it took way too long and so we got irritated.. next was the man who made the coffee, he just ignored us! Other people wo didn't get in line got helped before us.. Took us 15 minutes to get a coffee and there was only one person before us.. The place gets very crowded, which is a logical thing but still it's very unpleasant. The museum itself just didn't blow us away, we are big art lovers but the combination of crowded rooms and having to wait before you can enter didn't get compensated.

She yelled at me so forcefully and loudly that I actually cried. She said and i quote \"I'm security and I say no\". If thats the case then the luggae room staff shpuld also be made aware of what the security guard wishes. I went back downstairs to put my items away and tell the luggage staff. They were confused as to why the security guard would say that and offered come back up with me. They then just told me to go via the picture gallery entrance which was helpful. I noticed a lot of other people with cameras and small side bags so I couldn't understand why she'd pick on me. This really affected my experience of this lovely gallery."

And particularly if you are in Rome in Spring, when the weather is nice and the sun is shining. Note that the Borghese Gallery is not easy to access. If you are on foot there are two possibilities: Either you go to Piazza del Popolo and than turn left and walk up the whole way (but that is rather far - it will take you up to half an hour) or you can go to Piazza Spagna Underground Station and down there are the directions and you will follow them and walk and when you come out you will be just in front of the Villa Borghese.But do not worry about the difficulties of getting there, because once you are there believe me you will never forget it. Please Note: During High Season they only sell tickets online and you won't be able to purchase it at the ticket office. Also be aware that they are closed on Monday ! When you book a ticket online you can choose the time slot that will be good for you. Note that wandering inside the museum takes up to 2 hours :) and they have an excellent collection of Bernini Statues as well as paintings by Caravaggio. But this place is awesome not only because the Museum. It has a huge green, garden with Statues around and by the way there is a chance of hiring different types of bicycles (which are at a quite reasonable price) and one should do it and afterwards cycle on different routes, which are also marked.There is a cafe inside the museum, but I highly recommend to take your own food and have a picnic outside in the green. The Museum has also it's shop and there you can by art magazines for only 2.50 EUROS - which is excellent because it is good quality magazine about several Italian painters that has a great English text along.

There are very few bars or food places within the gardens and villa so take your own water. The villa interior is crammed with the most amazing sculptures of the Rennaissance period, Canova and Bernini being most prominent. They are displayed in order for people to be able to walk around them which is why the numbers of public are limited at any one time. A good idea, but not if you haven't got a ticket!!!!!Even my husband who is not usualy keen on museums was impressed by the villa and its contents.

You are limited to a 2 hour slot which is plenty and booking is essential. Note the photos I took were all of the decor, none of the paintings"

Take the time to see this Gallery and you will not be disappointed. We loved it.Part of the Roma Pass.You MUST make reservations ahead of time. We asked the Concierge in our hotel to make reservations for us several weeks ahead of time.No need to arrive at opening time- they only let 200 people in for each arrival time. Take whatever time slot is opened. Best would be the afternoon so you can see other things in the am.Arrive early as you will need to check your bags.You can take pictures inside. All the tour books said you cannot but this is not true! No flash allowed however. We had checked our cameras thinking we could not take them inside. (Hint: have locks to safe guard anything you are going to check) However, luckily we had our cell phones with us so could take pictures.We are not \u201cinto\u201d art but do appreciate great art when we see it- this is great art.Check out the sculpture of Napoleon\u2019s sister. Or the Bernini\u2019s sculptures. Truly outstanding.In room IV for Bernini note how the man\u2019s marble fingers dig into the female\u2019s skin- and this is made of marble!It did not take us 2 hours to see the whole thing but we went back to see our favorite parts at the end- they were less crowded than.If you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more."

This small museum is a true gem with an exceptional sculpture collection (which includes many Bernini's masterpieces) displaced in sumptuously decorated rooms. The collection of paintings is not as impressive, however. Visiting this museum took quite a bit of effort and planning. Firstly, there are only 360 tickets for each fixed 2-hour visit time window, hence on-line advanced booking is essential. Booking confirmation email with a ticket pick-up code as well as Photo ID are required for picking up the ticket at the museum. Secondly, even though the museum's web site listed 20 lines of buses for accessing the museum, there are only 2 buses stop near the museum entrance (stop: Pinciana /Museo Borghese) -- Bus 910 (direction: Mancini) from Republica metro station, and Bus 53 (direction: Mancini) from Barberini metro station. I was at Piazza Barberini at 4:10pm to take Bus 53 and barely made it to the museum on time for my 5pm entry because the bus ran every 18 minutes, but it was a more than 20 minute wait for this 10 minute ride. I'd advise others to start heading for the museum one hour before the entry time if you plan to take these 2 buses. Coming on other buses and metro listed on museum's web site would require quite a bit of walking in the vast park hence would be a good idea to have plenty of time to walk there."

Even in February it can get crowded.Second: our well-known guide book says that no camera are allowed - this is rubbish! All kinds of cameras are fine, but no flash. Third: bags have to be checked in - so you can't carry your camera bag with alternative lenses with you - have a jacket with large pockets and use these!The Canova carving of the Cardinal's wife - who was the sister of Napoleon, holding the golden apple that meant the artist was comparing her to the goddess Venus is absolutely stunning. It is in the centre of a room and can be viewed from all angles. The story of Venus and the apple is shown in a fantastic ceiling painting. The Galleria is crammed with wonderful paintings and stunning sculpture - and would have had a lot more if Napoleon hadn't \"bought\" a lot of them for himself!The book / souvenir shop is pretty good with some non-tacky things to buy. The refreshment area food looked good, but we didn't try it ourselves.When you've finished, walk up to the outdoor cinema area and hire a bike or a peddle-powered vehicle and enjoy the whole park in which the Galleria is situated.

The Gallery is the house (villa) which never served as a house for that family but a gallery. The owners enjoyed art so much they kept in that very place for exhibits only. Today it belongs to the community of Rome. I suggest a guided visit because the main purpose of your visit it will be to admire the works of Bernini made by his very hands since his 14's. Not doing so you will be fascinated withso many master pieces and it will end up confused. Take your time to enjoy the sculptures of Bernini and that is already quite a work! After the visit go for a stroll over the gardens up to the top of Piazza del Popolo."

After visiting Villa d'Este gardens in Tivoly and Versailles in France, I thought that the grounds would have been better looking than this. But I'll attribute it to the fact that it was January, therefore, the winter had an effect on the land. Right.The gallery itself was nice and busy. Book your tickets in advance because you wont get in otherwise. If you have a few days planned to be in Rome, you can always drop by and purchase your tickets for another day, but to visit on the same day is impossible.The Bernini sculptures are simply breathtaking! I stood in awe looking at all the details of the hair, facial expressions, bodies and forms. Take the time to admire the pieces. I don't know anything about art, but I know beauty when I see it.The rooms are well decorated and there are many paintings to see. Of course, the best, in my openion, is to check out the sculptures. But there is something for everyone from paintings to frescoes. I only felt that the place was a little old and dusty. Perhaps showing it's age a little. But it wouldn't stop me from going again and my expectations were perhaps a little high going in. But you have 2 full floors of amazing artwork to check, and paintings you only get to see in books normally, that are hanging right in front of your eyes.This places is packed and very busy, but towards the end of your 2 hour window, most of the people have left to give way to the next set of people, so take the time to go back to the 1st floor and give a final goodbye to the sculptures, by then, you'll have them all to yourself."

With an amazing collection of Caravaggio, Titian, Raphael and Rubens to name just a few even non art lovers should be impressed (our 15 and 17 year old sons found it interesting). The one failing is the two hour time limit on your visit guarantees you will need to return to fully appreciate all this museum has to offer. On your visit we suggest you go ahead of the crowd to the second floor and then come back to the first floor to avoid the crowds or enter ten minutes after your ticketed time to avoid the crush. There is a small refreshment area for drinks in the basement and you will need to check your bags while you are in the museum (this is free and provided by the museum). After your visit it is nice to walk through the park and work your way down through Piazza del Popolo to Via del Corso. The Borghese is definitely on our \"don't miss\" list in Rome!"

The steps up to the gallery levels are quite long and spiral, so some people might find these a bit difficult. There is a lift but it is one of the old fashioned metal ones with the shutter, and it is very small. They also have a sign saying that some wheelchair users might struggle with the small dimensions of the lift. The rooms are beautifully decorated and ornate, and themselves are works of art. There is a great variety of sculptures throughout, including a few which are truly magnificent. The paintings floor was good too, again, with a few stand out pieces but I enjoyed the sculptures a lot more personally. I think it is worth visiting, whether you're into sculptures or paintings or not quite sure.

The museum is in a palazzo set in lovely, park like grounds, and is small enough to enjoy without feeling overwhelmed, but large enough to hold many masterpieces well worth your attention. It is important to book your tickets online in advance as this is a popular attraction and they are very strict about entry times. You will be given a specific entry time and must show up within that 15 minute period. Bring your codice (reservation number) to the window to get your admission ticket. Do not forget the codice, you will not be given your ticket without it. Once inside, enjoy the great masters that are found at every turn, such as Bernini's Appollo and Daphne, as well as works by Caravaggio, Titian, and others. Maximum visit length is two hours, but the upside of this is that the museum is not overcrowded as the maximum number allowed is 300. There is an optional audio guide for 5 euro, useful if you are interested in the stories behind the sculptures and paintings. Admission is 11 euro"

Prime place for me are the extraordinary Bernini sculptures. He brings marble to life with unparalleled technique and beauty. The works at the Borghese, including the Rape of Persephone, Apollo and Daphne and David seem to be the work of a magician rather than an artist. But an artist he was. Close behind is the Caravaggio collection; covering all stages of his career and capturing the many moods of this peerless painter. Add to this marvelous offerings by Perugino, Canova, Bassano and more and you have one of the world's great museums providing you with a most memorable experience. We had the benefit of a great guide and skip the line admission, but a guidebook or the audio guide and advance purchased tickets will work as well.

At the most basic level, it's at least a break away from all the religious themed art, but really, it houses the most undeniably beuatiful sculptures outside of the Louvre and the Vatican.Do NOT forget the Pinacoteca upstairs, even if the really awesome works are on the main floor."

They give you a two-hour window and you MUST be there on time or lose some of your allocated slot of 2 hours because once your 2 hours are up, you are booted out to make room for others wanting their share of looking at the stupendous sculptures and paintings. There is a coat check down the stairs from the street level which is also the entrance to the museum. Don't make the mistake of walking up the stairs from the street level to the open door above because you will wait for no good reason only to be told to go get your tickets from down below. This museum comes to life with the excellent audio guide which is a MUST have. Plan to arrive early so that you have time to pick up your reserved ticket, check in your oversized backpack and get the audioguide for 5 Euros (well worth it). You will have to queue up for all these activities and you are losing time if you arrive just before your 2 hour slot. Also note that public transportation to this museum by Metro involves a long walk (20 minutes total at a very fast trot uphill on Via Veneto, walking under the walls to enter the park and then turning right and walking to the museum inside the Borghese gardens). The metro stop is Barberini. There are masterpieces almost in every room of this museum. You will remember this museum for the rest of your life if you decide to visit it and plan properly."

This museum is a smaller museum which makes it possible see almost everything within the 2 hour time frame. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and we're not able to get in on the same day as tickets were sold out. They let a limited number of people in, in 2 hour times slots. This helps with crowd control and allows a more enjoyable let experience. We ended up reserving tickets for the next day for 9 am. When we cam back we picked up our audio guides for \u20ac5 each. They only accept cash for the audioguides. The audioguides were informative and enjoyable. You also must check you bags as you are not allowed to bring them in. Since we had the earliest time slot, there weren't a ton of people which made the museum more enjoyable. The audioguides walked us through the entire museum which is broken down into two levels; the first level which has all the sculptures and the second which has all the painting.I personally enjoyed the sculptures the most. The gallery holds many pieces of artwork from Bernini and Carravagio, which were amazing. At the end of your 2 hour time slot, security announces that you must leave the gallery. They start shutting down rooms and moving people out in preparation for the next group. We really enjoyed this museum and would recommend it to anyone visiting rome!"

It's necessary to book the tickets online since the visits are limited to 360 people every two hours. You have to arrive there half an hour before your due time to pick up the tickets at the entrance and leave all your bags in the cloackroom. I'd recommend you to spend some time before or after your visit strolling around the Villa Borghese, a wonderful park with the possibility of renting a bike to move around."

We took the bus to the Borghese park but the stop we wanted wasn't clearly marked; luckily the bus driver told us where to get off. The collection inside is, of course, amazing. My guess is that with limited tickets being sold for different time slots that there is always the same general amount of visitors. We had 5pm tickets and it wasn't that crowded. Our visit lasted about 1.5hr, while taking our time."

This art Gallery is not to be missed, if you have to start cutting things out due to time constraints this should go on the very short list. This is truly one of the best tourist spots in town. When you get here and buy your ticket, it is only good for a couple of hours.

As a result, you can get up close to the sculptures without fighting your way through the crowds. The mix of ancient and renaissance art is intriguing.

He showed us the art and explained the politics and history of the Burgese family in conjunction with the background of the artists. I must admit my ignorance of the art we were seeing but after the tour I will say that I am now a fan of Bernini. His sculptures were spectacular, I am not exaggerating that. His sculpture of Pluto and Persephone made marble look as soft as human flesh. Caravaggio's painting were very impressive and once put into context by Simone became even more so. I believe that I would not have gotten half as much out this visit without Simone."

It is almost impossible to purchase tickets on site. Buy tickets online prior to the day when you want to tour. Because tickets are scheduled for a specific arrival time, with a two hour time limit for seeing the gallery, there is a real limit on the number of tickets available. Do not bother with \"skip the line offers\", for which you will pay more than double the price of a ticket purchased on line.

The Villa Borghese is famous for the magnificent collection of mostly Baroque sculptures and paintings, and in particular the major examples of the work of Bernini. This museum shows how a museum should be run. You have to ring to make a booking for a time slot. The operator speaks perfect English, and the whole process takes about 1 minute. We used the Roma Pass so had \"free\" entry. You arrive 30 minutes before your booking, quote the booking number, and in you go. The galleries are not crowded, and you have time to see everything at your leisure. For those with a serious interest in art, you will be in heaven. Everywhere you turn is an other amazing painting by Carravagio, a sculpture by Bernini, and a myriad of other famous names of the Renaissance and Baroque. We bookeD our time slot early, which was good insofar as the tour groups had not arrived even by the time we left. even if they had, the numbers for each time slot are limited.

Within the Villa Borghese Park, this grand party Villa built by the Cardinal nephew of a Borgia pope.

There is a second level of paintings, including a room dominated by Reuben and another by Titian works as well as numerous others. We enjoyed a two hour visit. You can only book a two hour slot and you will need the full two hours to explore all the 20 rooms, each with a different theme. We found it less busy than the Vatican museum, with lots more room to wonder round the rooms all with spectacular ceilings and some with Roman mosaic floors. Entry price was 11 euro for adults and 2 euro for under 18 years. Outside we spent another hour wondering the lovely parklands. We didn't have time to visit the zoo."

Take your emailed receipt and pick up your tickets a few minutes before your alloted time.They only let so many people in at a time and a reservation is required.Here's another tip. Don't be the first in the door. Even though there are only about twenty people in the whole group, let them get ahead of you a little and then you can enjoy rooms to yourself. You have two hours. If you really admire all of the artwork it may take you most of that to get through it. Toward the end of your two hours, go back to a room again to enjoy the artwork there most likely by yourself."

Inner rooms are interesting and you can admire works in small groups or even alone without pressure when you are inside but just for limited time. I\u2019m trying to enter each time when I visit Rome. Gallery is small and limitations for the visit are reasonable. Problem is organization with bad reservation system. It is not polite to visitors and staff is always nervous, sometimes even brute. Managers of the gallery are nearly never present. They can organize waiting place and entrance inside, from the cellar where they are selling tickets. \u201cSystem\u201d mix checking of baggage and cloakroom and people of different ages and languages entering, moving to the shop or out. They allow that people wait before the entrance without order in bad weather. It is possible to organize visit in small groups of ten to enter one after another and on some other ways. In theory it is possible that some can enter when others leave; some exit in one hour but people before the doors wait and wait. Bernini, Canova, Tizian, Caravaggio are not guilty. Gallery with more than five stars is pushed to lover level because of bad leadership. Task of the gallery, to promote art and artists is not perfected."

Definitely worth booking online beforehand tosc.it (tickets sell out) and getting the audio guide. Lots of Caravaggios too. Quite a small gallery so the audio tour takes about 1 hour 30 mins."

One should go because the paintings and sculptures are superb, but be prepared to be herded into and out of the museum according to a strict timetable. The signage is in Italian with only an occasional brief notice in another language, although the headsets can be ordered in any number of languages. The paintings are not well protected from sun and air and one wishes for more care to be taken to protect these masterpieces."

There are other museums in Rome that feature great paintings displayed in a grand palace (the Doria Pamphilij and the Colonna come to mind), but i found them to be disappointing: the surroundings seem shabby, and the paintings are poorly displayed and lit. The Borghese is many notches above the others. The rooms are breathtaking, the collection is magnificent, and the effect is stunning. Many of the paintings are hung too high to permit close viewing, but that is the only defect. The Bernini sculptures are, by themselves, worth the price of admission, but the collection of paintings is outstanding. They now allow photos, which is nice. Note that your visit is limited to two hours, and the clear the galleries at the end of each two-hour period. If you're serious about art, be sure to buy your tickets ahead of time and consider buying a second ticked for the next two-hour period so that you can spend four hours in paradise. It will be worth it!"

Book your tickets on line at least a week before your visit or ask hotel staff to help you out with reservation! It's within walking distance from Ancient Rome district and gave us an opportunity to see Via Veneto as well. The art collection at the Gallery is truly amazing. You get ONLY 2 (two) hours to spend there, so use it to your advantage and according to interest! Buy Audio guide - it's worth it! Start from the Pinacoteca on upper floor, featuring masters like Titian, Caravaggio, Raphael, Correggio and many others. Then move to lower floors to admire the unforgettable marble sculptures by Bernini (David, Apollo & Daphne, The Rape of Proserpina, etc.) and Antonio Canova (Venus). Wall and floor mosaics are also worth while seeing! Would visit this gallery again!"

Unless you've ever been here and seen the sculptures you'd have trouble appreciating my description of the amazing beauty of the seemingly alive sculptures in this museum. My favorite is \"The Rape Of Propina\" by Bernini, which seems so real that you find it hard to believe the subjects are marble and not soft flesh. The Bernini's and other fine pieces here are true treasures. If you ever get to Rome, Invest the time and the minimal gate charge to see this museum. Plan a full day here- it is amazing. If I could only visit one place in Rome, it would be hard for me to chose between this and the Vatican Museum & Sisten Chapple. By the way, the Borghese has many paintings as well as sculptures, and it has a pretty decent cafeteria & gift shops too. Cabs all know where this place is, just say BORGESE MUSEUM, even if they do not speak English, this will get you there."

While we were there they had designed dresses placed throughout the gallery - giving it a refreshingly modern look to the gallery. We found the museum hard to get to and hard to get back from if you go at night and recommend a taxi. We took a wrong turn and ended up walking through the park in pitch dark until we ran across Piazza del Popolo It is highly recommended that you book a time either by phone or on the Internet to come to this Museum. Arrive thirty minutes early,. You must check any bags. Non flash pictures were allowed. We ate at the cafe at the bottom floor of the gallery, the food was quite good. I would not got to this gallery without reading up on the works of art and the history of the gallery first."

It\u2019s not a huge museum, but it is packed. The time window is usually two hours and can be done in two hours. The tickets can be reserved on-line. PLAN AHEAD and BUY TICKETS ON-LINE. There were so many visitors who were showing up the day of and hoping to get in, when I went the tickets were sold out for at least a week. The museum has an impressive statute collection surrounded by paintings. Reminds me of the Barnes in Philadelphia. The acquisition means are very different, but similar in scope, display and concentrated impact. The Borghese is located in a park that is beautiful to walk around in as well."

Order tickets in advance, since they are usually sold out. Bring your receipt to someone in a blue jacket standing outside the museum, then walk down the steps to the book store to check in all of your bags. Although the web site said you cannot take pictures I asked and was told - You ARE allowed a camera but no flash \u2013 bring a monopod. This is also where you can rent a audio guide or join a group. Since it is already costing you a fair amount of money get the most out of your visit and get one of them. We rented an audio guide for about 5 euro. FYI there are two stories with a narrow staircase leading up - no elevator available when we went . One more important point I was told by the guide that ( as when we were there) the bathrooms are often closed . In short - we loved it and spend as long as they let us \u2013 two hours."

            "review": "Heaven for 90 minutes. This is in my opinion, the best art gallery in all of Rome. In the early 1600's Cardinal Scipione Borghese created his gallery and housed it in this beautiful building. Unlike other great collections, this building was created as a museum not a home. All available surfaces are painted on with unbelievable frescoes. Words cannot describe the beauty.The cardinal obtained his art with a heavy hand. It was not beneath him to brow beat, cajole or threaten to get his art and he did a great job too! Tickets are needed before you go and you can get them on line. You have a bit less than 2 hours to view the pieces. 360 people are let in each 2 hours so if you've a mind to prepare, do some reading about the collection. I recommend starting on the top floor. Everyone starts on the bottom and it's more crowded.i heartily recommend getting the audio guide. It's lovely to be told the stories and gossip surrounding the pictures and artists as well as the Cardinale.There is a coat check and you must check backpacks, large purses, and briefcases. You are allowed to photograph the art but without flash so IPads are greatThere is a small snack bar mostly sweets, coffee and drinks. Hint, pay for what you want first then go over to the other counter and order it. I waited for Bout 10 minutes to order only to be told to pay first.The staff are very nice. My a partner uses a cane and the woman staffing the desk asked us if we wanted to use the elevator. This was handy as it dropped us on the 3 rd level so we could walk down. Oh, I almost lost sleep over the ticket retrieval. It says you must produce a picture ID and the voucher must be printed out. We were not staying in a hotel so printing wasn't an option. In Rome these days there aren't many Internet cafe's in fact we found 2 and each one said their printers were down ( probably for years) so with heart in mouth I approached the woman behind the desk to get out tickets. Had my passport and my driving license. She asked my name, clicked on the computer and Viola! My tickets. So don't go to extraordinary lengths to get the voucher printed. We took every minute of the allotted time. There was so much to see. I could have used at least another half hour but nonetheless this is a collection not to be missed. I left the gallery walking 2 inches above the ground. I had been in heaven."

We spent several hours doing just that. Highly recommended that you book in advance, which we didn't, and had to wait to go to the 1pm session the following day. Check session times.

Don't worry about this, it just means you have an allocated place at your given time. It's strictly a two hour visit and if you buy the audio tour @ 5euro per person then you will see most of the main pieces of art within your allocated time.

The visits are scheduled in 2 hour blocks thus limiting the number of people in the gallery at a time allowing for a much more intimate experience. Time in the gardens is highly recommended.Flora A"

So I can't say much for the gallery since it was completely sold out when we got there, so book in advance!Instead we decided to wonder around the gardens and in the end decided to get one of the strange peddling cart things. Don't know how to describe it other than a little car with power assisted peddling involved. It was 12 euros for an hour which was plenty for us as once you get started, you realise the gardens are not that big. But we had so much fun and it was a lovely place! worth a visit!It's quite a walk but doable. We didn't get any public transport while in rome and walked everywhere."

We booked the last two hours of the day to visit (5-7PM) which is good because there is always fewer people. However, there are no,guides on offer except the audio guides which are a bit off the entrance so we missed them... Since the collection was a private one put together by one man while he was alive, the works are very 'similar' and without a more detailed knowledge of the history one misses much because the explanations next to the works are insufficient. The park around the villa is fun to visit hiring one of those bike-carts, absolutely worth your while!"

We arrived very early and after picking up our tickets we wandered around in the gorgeous gardens. The signage is not ideal and it takes a while to find the actual gallery, so give yourself extra time. The collection is very beautiful: statues, paintings, frescoes, and a full room of Carravagio paintings. When we were there, the fashion stylist Azzedine Alaia had some of his dresses displayed among the art. It was terrific. His lines are very classic so it went very well with the renaissance pieces of work of the permanent collection."

What I learned: For the Borghese Gallery, you can't wing it on the weekends even in the off-season! No tickets available til Tuesday, when we'd be home. Tickets were available during the week this late in the season, tho some two-hour slots were sold out. Our hotel concierge said it seemed unlikely that walk-up tix would be available because people pay for them in advance. Don't know if other travelers have tried that?

The galleries are very well organized and are huge.

Go in the door under the stairs leading into the building and get your tickets. The receipt was accepted without problem and we then went over to the Audio Guide table and got very good Audio Guide equipment for 5 euro each. You are not allowed to carry bags or large purses into the museum and they have a good cloakroom to leave you belongings but since you know better now bring a small purse and ditch your big bags elsewhere. A small purse or camera is fine but we saw them require what I would consider a standard purse to be checked. You get in the Gallery right at the assigned time. Do not get in a big rush \u2013 let the anxious folks go first because it is better to be behind the crowd and take your time. The two-hour window will get most of us through without a problem and by the end of the two hours your feet will hurt anyway. The Bernini sculptures are fantastic and the entire building is a huge piece of art. If we were here for a few more days I would make another reservation and go again just to look at the items that I may have missed. For those of you that do not like stairs ask to use the elevator to go up to the upper floor where the paintings are located. There are 105 stairs to get to the floor and lots of folks were having problems.I have attached a snapshot of Pauline Bonaparte and David but these are only two of hundreds of sculptures."

The older heavy set lady with dark hair who takes your ticket at the entrance is nasty. I would rethink who welcomes customers into the building. She snaps at you if you didn't check your bag even if you apologize and say you thought it was after you entered the gallery. She raises her voice and says \"there are signs everywhere\". That's not the point lady. I intended to check my bag thinking it was just beyond the entrance. Thank goodness for the tour guide.

I was overwhelmed by the quality and the quantity of their collection of statues. There were also incredible collections of antique furniture and paintings from the old masters. I was especially taken with the room of paintings which displayed the effect of sunlight shining into a room as if it were coming from an unseen window. Any visit to Rome would be lacking without a tour of the Borghese Gallery."

The Borghese Museum aka galerie borghese has one of the best Italian collections of late Renaissance and Baroque Italian art in the world and it is all crammed in several rooms on two stories. It has a few Raphael's and two by Titian but it contains several of Bernini and Caravaggio. You must reserve ahead of time for a two hour slot. After two hours, they kick you out but we finished in less than 90 minutes. It is definitely a day one attraction for art lovers and day two or three for everyone else."

So sad that you are only allowed two hours to enjoy it as it always feels like such a rush. So, make sure you make the most of your time. First, don't even think about appearing without a reservation. It seems to sell out every day, at least at the busy times of year. If you get the audioguide, it will direct you to start at a certain place in the gallery, which most people will do. As everyone comes it at the same time, this means you will be with a crush of people. I would recommend that you do one of two things instead. One option is starting at the Pinocateca Gallery which is on the second floor. Spend your half hour there, then go downstairs. The other option is to start st the end of the first floor tour, which is the Caravaggio room which tends to get very crowded. We most enjoyed our last 45 minutes in the gallery because we managed to escape the crowd. It's worth a little strategy to do this as we got to see all our favourites in silence. Also, we read in some source that photos are not allowed and that you would have to check your cameras but this is not true, everyone was snapping away."

You can only go at a reserved time, which is because they restrict the number of visitors to a reasonable amount. Also, the audio guide was STELLAR. We used many audioguides in many museums and galleries, and this one was best: perfect balance of amount of info and type (combination of historical and/or artistic relevance, acquisition info, etc.) for those of us interested in important art but not terribly educated about it. Also the audioguide is timed for 90 minutes and your reserved stay is 120 minutes, allowing you to focus on what mattered and have a little extra time for things that caught your eye, and to move around. We recommend you listen to the intro piece then move up to the second floor, away from the crowd. We ended up having many rooms to ourselves! Travel note: we struggled with our public transit route for this destination plus were in crammed rush hour Metro cars. We ended up grabbing a cab outside of a fancy hotel and being taken right to the gallery gate for just a few Euro, which was great."

The Borghese is to the north of the city at the top of the Via Veneto and is accessible by metro or bus. We walked from our hotel on the Via XX Settembre and it only took about 20 minutes.The Galleria is situated in parkland that is pleasant to walk around but, realistically, needs some better up keeping in my view.To access the Galleria you do need to pre book a time slot as only 360 people are allowed in per slot and for 2 hours maximum. You can book on-line and collect your tickets at the reception desk.To do justice to the treasures on view would take more words than are available in a review. All I can really say is, simply stunning.I would buy a guide book, available in the shop for 16 euros although you can hire an audio tour.There is a cafe in the basement tha serves great coffee and snacks.A top tip is to get to the place at least 45 minutes before your time slot. The queues can get lengthy to collect tickets and for the cloakroom. You are not allowed to take coats or bags into the collection rooms.A must see really."

We took the audio tour, which made it much more enjoyable. I was a bit disappointed that the paintings were not on par with the outstanding sculptures. Seeing the Bernini Apollo and Daphne was worth every euro to get in. The palace itself is also a work of art - it would have been awesome if it could have had a few furnished rooms."

I never really \"got\" Bernini until I had a guided tour of the galleries which are not at all crowded due to the restricted entry - only c300 people in each 2 hour slot. The Caravaggio collection was another highlight as was the unexpected haute couture collection mirroring the folds and colours in the sculpture and paintings surrounding the pieces. The English speaking guide was originally from Argentina and our small group enjoyed her interpretations of the historic collection.Come early and stroll around the gardens - I walked from via Veneto but you can also approach from Piazza del Populo or Spagna."

            "review": "A Highlight of My Recent Visit to Rome. I have been to Rome at least six or seven times now (I love that I'm losing count - means I'm finally getting familiar with the eternal city!), but before the last trip (just three weeks ago) I had only been to the glorious Borghese Gallery once, and that in the late 90s, when it was undergoing such extensive renovation that only the ground floor was open. Fortunately on that ground floor stood some of the treasures of the Borghese - at least three Berninis in a row (Apollo and Dafne and the David among them), and I was bewitched.Since then the Borghese has been restored magnificently, but the difficulty factor in getting into the museum has increased. Timed tickets only, booked in advance. THIS time I finally got back to it, and got a good look at the entire Borghese. There are great paintings and especially sculptures enough to make this museum absolutely world class, but the building itself and its gorgeous interiors are almost as wonderful as the art.So as soon as I knew when my train would arrive in Rome I booked a timed ticket for three hours later. Once there (and boy, did I get lost in the Villa Borghese - those gardens are very difficult to navigate!) there was still a short wait. A line outside the entrance was divided by a sharp and friendly young member of the museum stance. Those without timed-tickets were ushered into another long line outside - where, if there was room after the ticket holders who had booked in advance were let in, a few of those in that line MIGHT have the chance to get in themselves. I was ushered right in, to another wait - of about ten minutes, until the stroke of three pm, when my \"time\" had come. This is probably somewhat tedious to at least some visitors, but it seems the only way the museum can cope with the crowds - even with the carefully allotted number of people I still found it a bit of tour group hell, groups herded around guides speaking English, French, German and of course Italian (there may have been more languages represented, but those I recognized), but especially after the first few minutes where everyone is stuffed into the entry and still confused about which way to turn, there was room to breathe and more importantly to gaze on not just the Caravaggios and Berninis etc, but also the breathtaking walls and ceilings (even if you don't like the art in front of you, just look up).I had an absolutely wonderful visit, though I confess that my first time, back in the late 1990s, remained with me. At that time I was only vaguely aware of who Bernini, for instance, was. Now I am much better versed in his sculpture, which I think is THE reason to visit the Borghese, crowded as it is not just with tourists but with other great artists and sculptures, and in art history as a whole, but the air of entering a place mostly closed off and discovering a new artistic hero was not lost, but considerably lessened. This is one of my very top recommendations in Rome!"

The site of the museum (in a very large park) and the building itself are beautiful - gorgeous ceilings and mosaic floors.I was so excited to see all of the Bernini sculptures there and they did not disappoint - just stunning. There was also a temporary exhibit of Azzedine Alaia's gorgeous couture clothing.Based on Rick Steves' recommendation we booked tickets one week in advance, although I have no idea how frequently they actually sell out of particular time slots. I appreciate that they limit the number of people who can visit at any given time so it doesn't feel crowded.The only negative was that the entrance was unclear. You have to go into the basement to check in and then go outside and up a flight of stairs to enter the exhibition space. (This was not explained to us.) Also, be aware that all bags and purses need to be checked.The museum also includes a cafe a gift shop.It was getting dark by the time we left the museum so we didn't get to explore the gardens much, but what we saw was lovely."

A country bumpkin might grin and say that this small but widely acclaimed (and rightly so) gallery is \"full of busts, both kinds, and more 'junk' hanging out than a redneck front yard.\" A lot of nudes, in other words, but if that was your outlook on the arts you would not be coming here.You will need to buy tickets months in advance, of course, and they will be for a specific time slot of two hours long. That requires more planning than many people are comfortable with, but they limit attendance within each group so that visiting here is much more pleasant than places like the Vatican Museum (see my review) or the Uffizi Gallery in Florence (see my review). You can actually stand close to the art and admire it at length without being jostled or elbowed out of place. Anyway, to visit, you will need to arrive early and go downstairs to exchange your online voucher for real tickets and to check your camera bags, purses, backpacks, but NOT coats, in the coat room. Helpful hint: carry a small nylon duffel bag (with a shoulder strap, to carry your coats in as the day heats up, and you can then check THAT here. Then go outside and take the steps up to the \"0 floor\" and start your tour there (they will let you in at exactly your appointed time). Just inside the door pick up a little pamphlet in your language; it may help a bit. For serious art lovers, you will need a guidebook, but if you're like me and don't much care who did it or even what it is called but just want to appreciate each piece you like on its own merits you can probably be done here in an hour. They're going to kick you out after two, so make good use of your time. The \"zero floor\" is mostly sculpture in some spectacularly elegant room settings, with four rooms dedicated to masterworks by Bernini, who may be the best ever, at least in my poorly educated opinion. Amazing. The \"1 floor\" above is mostly paintings. Because the crowd has been managed I suggest seeing the lower floor first, and then as time permits going to the upper floor."

In another visit if I am so lucky, I will take a taxi as close as allowable. It was a longish walk, but to be honest, it was worth it. The Borghese is breath-taking. I discovered what a genius Bernini is and saw the opulence of the aristocrats. You don't see this at home, I'm guessing. Be amazed at the grandeur.

Why, oh why, do these places shoot themselves in the foot by doing such a poor job of customer service that they nearly ruin a great art collection? The cynic in me says that the answer is in the question - when you have something great, you don't really need good customer service to get the money coming in (especially when you have limited capacity).I'll start with the good - the content. The art collection is both interesting and excellent in equal measure. The headliners are the real highlight - the paintings by Caravaggio and the sculptures by Bernini. There are several 'masterpieces' which captivate and come with an interesting back-story. Furthermore, the interiors of the gallery itself are works of art - they could sell tickets to empty rooms given the quality of the wall and ceiling decorations. They very helpfully provide information explaining the history of the room itself and how the content has changed over the years.So, why was I so negative at the start? Well, they really don't make you feel welcome. The gallery has a relatively small capacity and so booking tickets in advance is a must - you need to be there an hour or so before a pre-allocated time slot to collect from the ticket office. After doing so, and having a wait before we could enter, me and my wife went to the cafe where the service was at best functional. There were no niceties and no friendly tones, it was very down to business. The cafe has very little space / seating given how many people are waiting around - and the rules seem overly constricting. There are several 'no food past this point' signs and, despite there being more space they could make available for people to wait in comfort with what they have ordered, you are cramped into a smallish area with a handful of tables and one or two benches.Another aspect of the service which seems unnecessarily rule-based is making it compulsory to put your bag in the cloakroom (where they ironically refuse to take any coats from people). Naturally, given the pre-allocated slots and compulsory nature this gets very crowded and there will be a big queue just before the time window starts. It all just feels a bit like rules for rules sake.I understand that there is a need to limit throughput, to protect and conserve. However, I compare this to galleries with similarly high profile pieces such as those in London - where you can walk in, no charge, no security check, no unnecessary rules and limitations, no unnecessary discomfort - that seem to do a perfectly good job of looking after the art they are responsible for.I'm afraid I just find it a little frustrating that such a great collection of pieces are wrapped in quite a poor service."

If you don't have time for the Vatican Museums or don't want to support the Roman Catholic Church, you can go to the Villa Borghese in stead. Book your tickets online in advance and get a two hours' time block. Don't walk in during the first ten minutes of your time block, because the crowd will already do. Most of that crowd will be out again within three quarters and then you have the whole building for yourself and the other real art lovers. Enjoy Bernini's statues of Apollo and Daphne or David or Pluto and Persephone, Canova's Pauline Borghese as she is laying on pillows and a matrass, all marble of course. Enjoy Caravaggio's, Rubens' and Honthorst's paintings, the gorgeous wall, ceiling and floor decorations and all these smaller artifacts. Don't forget the second floor, a bit hidden away. After this museum one needs a proper recovery. A walk through the beautiful park will help."

If one has a reservation then one enters downstairs and one exchanges the voucher for a ticket around 30 minutes before the alloted time. All of the signage said no cameras. One has to go to the cloakroom area and check coats, backpacks, purses, cameras, and more. Once the items are checked, then one can get an audio tour using the cloakroom ticket as the reminder to return the audio. With the audio in hand, then one goes outside and up the stairs to wait in line ( Italian style- in a crowd) for the time to enter. The previous groups has to go out before the next group can go in. As soon as we entered we saw that most people did not store their cameras and everyone was taking photos including photos of the no cameras signs. The collection is massive. Even with the audio one can only take on so much information. I think one could go there and spend the entire time allotment in one room. There is so much to see. I felt badly that we passed by items without a glance because there was so much. It is a great experience for any art lover."

You have to buy a ticket in advance from the website. I didn\u2019t find this process quite as easy as all the guidebooks said it would be, but I was able to negotiate it successfully in the end. When you arrive before your tour time, you enter at the ground floor level and pick up your tickets. There may be long lines for the audioguides, so make sure you\u2019re in the correct line! Big bags have to be checked, but cameras are allowed (no flash). The routing of the tour was different than what\u2019s given in the guidebooks I had looked at. We were sent up a spiral staircase to the second floor and then down to the main floor, where most of the Berninis are.During our visit, there was a special exhibit of couture designs by Azzedine Ala\u00efa mixed in with the Classical and Renaissance art. This produced surreal juxtapositions at times--gold chainmail minidresses next to classical statues, extremely elongated black evening gowns spotlighted as if they were Baroque statues.The Berninis are just amazing, and with the lack of crowds, you can get fairly close and examine details--Daphne\u2019s toes as they turn to tree roots, the softness of Persephone\u2019s flesh as Hades\u2019 fingers press in. They deserve the time and space you\u2019ll have to contemplate them. Don\u2019t miss the horse and rider tumbling through the wall in one of the larger rooms. The Borghese Gallery was a highlight of our visit to Rome.Take time to walk through the Borghese Gardens before or after your visit to the gallery. They are a pleasant respite from Rome\u2019s traffic and bustle."

The palace is a lush environment--like a jewel box of color. We've seen a lot of gorgeous museums in France and Italy, but this place was just awe-inspiring.

They are strict about only allowing people two hours inside the gallery and you will need all of the two hours. Turn up five minutes before your scheduled time and you could find it takes you 20 minutes to actually get inside but by that time the clock will have been ticking on your visit for 15 minutes."

Set in the idyllic park surrounding the Gallery, it is a peaceful oasis from the noise and chaos that is Rome. The collection of sculptures is so amazing that the paintings often do not get the recognition they deserve. The sculptures of Bernini are divine but so are the paintings of Raphael and Titan. If you are a lover of art, this is not to be missed."

The photos I took do not do them justice, they are breathtaking!!! The museum is definitely worth the visit to see these master pieces up close. Seeing all those famous paintings in person was hard to believe. In reference to some comments I read before my trip about rude staff, personally everyone was very polite to us, however I witnessed one of the staff members being a little rude with one group that missed their booking. Our booking was for 5:00pm and no one was allowed in not even 1 minute before! They are very organised and get upset if anyone tries to break the rules. Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy the lovely park the museum is situated in, as it was raining :("

That was not an easy thing to do. I tried to book online but my credit card was repeatedly refused. (the same card was used with no problem on the Vatican web site and for the transfers) My daughter booked for me using her credit card and when the confirmation was printed out the instructions for picking up the tickets at the gallery were precise stating one needed photo id and the credit card used to purchase the tickets. I called the gallery and the man who answered impatiently hung up on me. I called another day and a woman who answered, likely because she had a better command of English, listened and told me to bring a signed authorization from my daughter. My daughter prepared that and gave me her card to take on the trip and I had a handful of documents to present at the ticket office. When I handed the wad of papers to the man he barely glanced at them and printed my tickets. I did not know whether I was disappointed or relieved but it went well nonetheless. ( A man ahead of me in line at the ticket office was stunned when he was told he could book tickets for a week from then. He lingered trying to overcome what he could not understand and the ticket agent explained again and again that the gallery was booked until then.) Our group walked in the gardens until our entrance time and enjoyed them immensely. It is a lovely spot for picture taking but every step in Rome is that too.Our time in the gallery was joyful. There are so many priceless treasures and all so well positioned for viewing that it would be impossible not to love the experience. I was surprised that many of the people around me are so poorly informed about what they are looking at but seemed to be enthralled at any rate. Baffling to me that they would pay so much and go to the trouble to be there and not have a basic clue as to what the collection was about. But to each their own."

One is powerfully moved by the imagination, creativity, and genius of the artists and designers who created this masterpiece. The museum contains multiple masterpiece paintings by Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian, as well as beautiful sculptures by Bernini and Canova. The marble mosaic floors one wants to reproduce in one's own home! Take a tour if you wish, but also walk through the museum at your own pace so you can absorb as much as possible. When we were there, the museum was cleared periodically, so check on times. Also check on how to get there. It's near a main road to the south, so don't walk endlessly through the park to get there! In the bookstore, pick up a book on the collections. And absolutely,...don't leave Rome without going."

Walk-in viewing isn't possible. Your hotel can take of this for you or you can go on line yourself for the reservations."

Unless you are an art historian, I suggest going on a guided tour or rent the audio headset (English, Italian, French, German, and Spanish). If you take a purse, backpack, stroller, etc, be prepared to check it at the cloakroom prior to your visit. Cameras are allowed.I booked our tickets 2 months prior to our arrival in Rome on the Borghese Gallery website. The cost was 11 Euros per ticket. Make sure you contact you credit card company and alert them to the charge so that the foreign transaction is not rejected. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday 9 AM - 7 PM. Closed on Mondays, December 25, January 1, and May 1. Entry to the museum is scheduled in 2 hour blocks of time. Make sure you are at the museum at least 20 minutes prior to you appointed time. Check in is in the lower level.We visited the gallery on our first day in Rome. The museum is 2 floors be prepared to climb stairs to the second level. Although it is not large we spent the entire 2 hours in the gallery using the audio set. We were glad that entry was limited because we were able to enjoy ourselves and not feel hurried or crowdedWe stayed near the Piazza Navona. The Concierge suggested taking a taxi (12 Euro) and save our legs for the museum tour. This was a great suggestion. There is also public transport by subway, bus and tram. After our tour we walked downhill to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain (under construction) and back to our hotel. Since we weren't in a hurry we stopped along the way and enjoyed a glass of wine in an outdoor caf\u00e9. Great way to start our Roman Holiday."

The collection is amazing and because they limit the number of people at any given time, you get to spend a lot of time up close with some of the best art in the entire world. The place is setup well and you can tell that the place was designed to showcase the art in the best way possible. Remember this was curated by a huge patron of the arts in this very place and it makes everyone who goes there appreciate it in the best way possible. You must have an advance reservation not only because of the lines but because of availability of the place. It is a MUST SEE and I think to appreciate art and the link of art and history this should definitely be part of your itinerary. See Ancient Rome + Borghese + Vatican in that order if you want to see how history meshes together and is puncutated by the Renaissance."

The strict reservation system and the inconvenient location limit the numbers who visit, and that makes the whole process far more pleasant (and far less cattle car-ish).As for the gallery itself--the Caravaggio and Bernini works are the obvious stars, but there is a wealth of material here. You can breeze through in an hour or so if you just give each item a cursory look, or you can spend your entire two hour block in just one room studying the amazing works on display...As much as the art, however, the palace itself is part of the attraction. This is one heck of a look at the opulence and luxury of another age (the word \"excess\" comes to mind). I enjoy studying the rooms as much as I do the art itself!"

The park in which the museum sits is also lovely, kind of a small Central Park--well worth the wander before or after. To fully enjoy the museum, however. takes some planning. 1. You need to reserve your tickets on line well in advance of the date of your visit. You pick up the tickets there before you enter. 2. Arrive at least 15 minutes early. You have to check your bags, and because visitors enter the museum at set hours, there is a long line to drop off bags just before an entry time.3. Get the audio guide. Without the guide, you won't know enough to appreciate all there is to see. 4. After you get the audio guide, take time to orient yourself with the map. Time spent in orientation will save wandering confused later (\"Is this #2?\"). 5. Keep track of time. Visits are limited to two hours. If you dawdle in the beginning, you'll have to rush at the end."

Go to the Borghese website and you can get them. With your on line receipt in hand you redeem it underneath the museum. With on line booking available there really isn't any reason for anyone to ever miss out on getting tickets unless of course they wait until the last minute to order them. Also check out a few online sites to get an idea as what you will be seeing on exhibit in the gallery.Get there at least 30 minutes before your admission time to avoid the ticket redemption line, and to get your bag stored. Remember when you go to get your bag back to use the line on the right otherwise you will be in the long line for storing bags.If you are there for the 11 am tour I strongly recommend signing up for the English tour of the museum. It is very inexpensive and well worth it. You can't sign up on line so once you redeem your on line voucher go in and stand in line for the headsets and tours. The day we went we had a marvelous person conduct our tour (I think she might have been the art director for the museum).The day we were here we could bring in our cameras even though everything I had read said you couldn't. I am glad I brought it along that day.There is a small gift shop and snack bar on the lower level along with toilets. Be sure to have your admission ticket with you if you plan to use the toilet otherwise the attendant won't let you in.There is ample bench seating underneath the gallery while you wait for your tour to start.Once the tour starts you immediately climb a high stairwell to the top floor of the museum. There is a small elevator that could be used if you have a problem with the 90 plus stairs.While we were there a special exhibit was on display that incorporated fashion into the items on display. I have included some pictures of that fashion.Once you climb the stairs be prepared to see some of the most beautiful pieces of art in the world today.The artists, sculptures and paintings are what you probably read about in school and here they all are under one roof for you to see first hand, up close and personal.A David is here, the rape of Proserpina is here, the Apollo and Daphne is here, Bernini, Canova, Ralphael and Corregggio are all here on display for you to enjoy.When done with the top floor you descend to the main floor and see even more wonderful art. As admissions are limited, the museum will not feel crowded. If a particular item is blocked just have a seat and wait for the people to move along.Note that the gallery tours last two hours and they are very strict about your leaving the area as soon as the two hours is over. If you arrive late for your admission time you still need to leave at the end of the time slot even if you were only there for 45 minutes.Once done with your visit, you can rest up in the snack bar area. Remember to order and pay at the counter before getting your items. Just put your receipt down on the bar top and someone will get you what you ordered.Once you leave the gallery you can stroll the grounds, get a bite to eat in a garden restaurant (if open) rent a bicycle carriage to pedal around, or just sit on a bench and enjoy the gardens."

There are spectacular sculptures and paintings by all of the Master Artists and Sculptors as commissioned by the Bishop. Each room in the mansion is unique and we spent over 2 hours mesmerized. This gallery was superior to the Uffizi Museum in Florence.= - we toured that place the following day."

            "review": "Best Museum in Italy. We were in Italy for two weeks and toured many museums, but I think the Borghese Gallery was our favorite. The Gallery itself is a beautiful building, and it houses many amazing works of art, including some very impressive statues. Admission is limited, so be sure to buy your tickets in advance. During busy times (we were there in July) they do sell out. We appreciated the limited admission because it allowed us to tour the Gallery without the crowds we encountered every where else we went on our trip. You are limited to two hours in the Gallery, which I am sure is not enough for true art aficionados, but for our family (including a 9 and a 14 year old) it was plenty of time. Finally, we really enjoyed the air conditioning. Sounds silly, but in July in Rome it was HOT! Our family agreed that our favorite statue that we saw on our trip was in the Borghese Gallery, Bernini's Apollo and Daphne. It is amazing how something so large and made in stone can seem to float in the room. It's in a room at the end of the self-guided tour, saving the best for last."

They limit the number of people who can enter at any given time so you never feel rushed or crowded.You must make reservations in advance so be sure to schedule your time and buy tickets before you leave for Rome. I highly recommend that you buy the guided audio tour, it is very well done and really adds to the experience as you view Bernini, Caravaggio, Rafael, and many other important works of art. Gallery and surrounding grounds make for a wonderful afternoon and break from the hustle and bustle of Rome."

The Park is absolutely enormous & being a Sunday was alive with activity with families . Quite a lovely experience to see how the Romans spend their weekends . The tour finished close to the top of the Spanish Steps & above Piazza Popolo which is a must to be seen . I highly recommend this tour . Try to organise prior to leaving as they are limited numbers [ about 8 to 10 only ] & are very popular."

This is a control-freak's gallery with only a 2-hour period allowed to view the amazing collection (including 6 Caravaggio paintings) and you need to show your ticket to use the toilets. None of the staff seem to speak any English, including those who answer the phone, and make no effort to try to help with your small amount of Italian. I've not had this response from any other art gallery in Europe, and given the cost to get in and hire an audio guide, a very unusual approach given the number of tourists to Rome who can't speak Italian but have English as their first or second language. Took the gloss off an amazing art collection."

Rick Steeve's book mentioned that you may be lucky and get in IF some people did not show up for their allotted time. We arrived at 8:45 for the 9:00 am showing and asked if there were any no-shows. So far no, comeback at 9:00. At 9:00 we were told we could get in as there were some no shows. Great. They only let in so many people for a 2-1/2 hour time period so this is why you need a reservation. Its usually full. The reason its usually full is because it is a fantastic place to see some beautiful art like Bernini, Canova, Caravaggio etc. The sculptures are incredible. We only got to 2 of the 3 floors in our time limit. We purchased the guide recordings and highly recommend it. With the small amount of visitors for the 3 floors, you can always find an exhibit for a private viewing.

Finally, 23 years later, I revisited this amazing gallery. The whole Gallery is filled with masterpieces, but without a doubt, Bernini's sculptures are the most outstanding. His 'David' is my favourite piece of art (as an artist that says a lot), and his 'Apollo and Daphne' is a close second. There are a number of his other astounding sculptures on display, and you don't have to have an academic background to be totally blown away by these masterpieces. He sculpted them from single pieces of marble with a virtuosity that is rarely encountered. If you're more interested in painting, there are some excellent Caravaggios on display.I would advise to book tickets on-line, with a guide if possible.Also, the gallery is not so easy to find within the Borghese park. If you're arriving by metro ( spagna is the closest stop) leave at least 20 minutes to find it. Alternatively, take a cab to the Gallery."

You're only allowed in for two hours then they close the rooms and let another lot in. The Bernini sculptures at Borghese are amazing to see in real life. I chose to see the sculptures first and the painting gallery second as the sculptures were what I most wanted to see. The detail and the emotion they exude have to be seen first hand. After the gallery you can also wander around the grounds. The signs to find the gallery aren't all that clear. For me, it was the highlight of a week in Rome."

You'll need to reserve your two-hour slot a week in advance if you want a prime visiting time. The building's rooms alone are worth the price of admission. The works of art are icing on the cake. Take time to walk the park. Especially when it's warm, the grounds are a green and quiet oasis. Although the Spagna Metro stop purports to be the stop for the Gallery, be prepared for a very long underground hike before you reach the appropriate exit. Several city bus routes will drop you off much closer to the Gallery."

I've wanted to visit the Galleria Borghese ever since we watched a BBC programme on Italy 5 years ago, but, being a disabled lady I thought it would just remain a dream. Well, Hubby and I were talking about things we'd like to see and I said oh the Galleria Borghese to see Bernini's Marbles would be a dream come true, Hubby immediately said why don't we go, so off we went.We went to Rome just to do this one thing so I booked a private tour through our tour operator well in advance. We took a taxi to the Gallery and were dropped off right at the entrance, we entered the gallery and as we were there a little while before we decided to have some lunch in their lovely caf\u00e9.We met our guide who was really good and she gave us earphones and a receiver to wear around our necks after we were all ready she took us in to the gallery to secure our bags in lockers. We proceeded on our tour which started on the lower floor so I got to see my marbles. Oh, I've never seen anything like them in my life breathtakingly beautiful and I was in awe. We then went upstairs to see the famous Caravaggio's, well I was n't sure I was going to interested in these but, they are amazing and Hubby loved the St Jerome so I was pleased he enjoyed something as much as I did.They looked after me very well and took me upstairs in their lift so disabled people we can do these lovely places.We upgraded our tour to a private tour and it was well worth it, we learnt so much from her and she showed us how to get the most out of the exhibit's. City Tours were the company we were booked with, we can't agree on the guides name one of us thinks it's Hayley and the other thinks it's Kylie so if one of us is right THANK-YOU once again you were amazing."

When I did get to the main attraction I was nothing less than stunned by the major works. The sculpture is breathtaking and I do not exaggerate when I say I was almost moved to tears by the beauty of Bernini and Canova's work. Just astounding. Frankly if you have to choose one art museum to see in Rome this is it. The gallery is located in the fabulous park Villa Borghese - pick a morning slot - we did 11AM-1PM - pick up your tickets early at the register and then take a nice stroll around the park while you wait for your entry time. Yes - buy those tickets early - the online process is easy - there are many comments about surly staff but I found them to be professional and serious about their work at such an important institution.

We were lucky in that we bought our tickets online just two days before we went. Tickets are sold in two-hour blocks and you enter exactly at the appointed time and are asked to leave when those two hours are up so that the next group can take their turn. Everything to be seen is on two floors of the former villa. We entered from the basement level and walked up a circular staircase to the top floor -- if the door to the second floor was open at the time, we did not notice it. A modern couture sculpture exhibit was interspersed amongst the classical works, adding an interesting dimension. Cameras are allowed, but no flash photography. You must leave your personal belongings at the bag check, including purses no matter how small, and are not allowed to take anything into the galleries. Read the rules online so there are no surprises. Restrooms on the basement floor ... must show your ticket to gain access. Also restrooms on the second floor.Inside each room of the gallery, look for the laminated information pamphlets that provide details about the room, what's hanging on the walls, and the paintings on the ceilings. Not really enough time to read it all, so I took photos of them to refer to later. Yes, as others have noted, the staff can be abrupt. Don't let them ruin the experience; you are there for the art not for them.Several bus lines take you there, we took #160 even though we knew it would mean a longer walk through the park to get to the gallery.

At the ticket desk they could not change 20 euro note for 17 euro entry fee and insisted we pay by card. You then have to check your bags in. This takes longer than getting the tickets and no information is given about what you can take into the gallery. On the door the security person was rude beyond belief and ranted in Italian because I had water on me which is not allowed in the building. This is despite information at the bag drop which was at least unclear. The museum is good but the hassle of getting tickets and getting in is rubbish from our experience."

The art and sculptures were nice enough, however, the items were rarely labelled and half of the time you had no clue what you were looking at. During our time there, there was a haute couture dress exhibition which covered up amazing floor mosaics.... really disappointing. Unless you are a hard core Italian art and sculpture fan, save your euros and rent a bike to tour the park."

This gave us time to stroll through the lovely gift shop and check our bags before our visit. You can only take wallets into the museum, not a purse, so be prepared to consider what you will take with you during your visit. I brought my guide book and my cell phone. You can take pictures during the visit, but no flash photography.My daughters enjoyed the dresses on the temporary display at the museum, but we also really enjoyed the amazing sculptures by Bernini. We all especially admired Apollo and Daphne. The paintings are also enchanting. We easily filled our two hours taking in all this museum had to offer.After our visit to the museum, we really enjoyed strolling through the Borghese Gardens to the Laghetto and renting (very inexpensive) a row boat to enjoy the Lake in the gardens."

We spent 45 minutes walking through the park before we got to the gallery which was wonderful. It is a beautiful green space in Rome to stroll and or people watch. The gallery or villa itself was spectacular. We were lucky enough to catch their designer gown display at the same time which was going on throughout the gallery. The dresses were an amazing backdrop to the art that is showcased in the gallery. I highly recommend getting the audio guide for the extra 5 euro as it gives a simple yet informative background on what you are looking at. The villa, art, sculpture, and park are all amazing and worth the visit. We used our Roma Pass which made this an even better deal."

I booked over the phone and for some reason the reservation did not appear in the system when I was at the gallery. So make sure you write down the name of the person you talk to as well as the confirmation number. I would even call a day after to make sure everything is OK with the reservation. This will avoid a lot of arguments and probably the possibility of not entering the gallery. Also, be warned that there is a very rude woman working at the ticket office who treats visitors terribly bad. Management at the museum should try to do something about it as this is a great small museum and that type of behavior is just unacceptable."

Fantastic park, but be prepared for walking, lots of little areas to sit and enjoy the views, you can find a nice shaded area and if you want hire a tricycle, the museum is great and well worth a visit just to see the statues. Suggest book through the hotel as there are normally time slots and if you just turn up, you may be disappointed and in for a long wait. The only downside is the noise of the birds in the park, they don't give up and put on plenty of insect repellent you can get bitten a lot, overall though a fantastic place."

We did this our last day in town, after the Vatican museums and many gorgeous churches, and it was the best art experience we had. The art was lovely, but the fact that much of it was commissioned to fit THIS space, or the space design specifically for that particular piece, it's an amazing full experience of walls, ceiling, and numerous art works in each room.Get the audio guide. It's definitely worth it. Then ignore the \"instructions\" and start by going straight upstairs. All guests have to enter at a set entry time (every two hours during the day). You have a timed 2 hour allotment, and most everyone starts in room #1. If you start upstairs you'll have many of the rooms and artworks to yourself to appreciate and enjoy. And you should still be able to take in the downstairs in the last 45-50 minutes of your visit."

I was worried we would feel rushed with the two hour limit - but, we actually had ample time to wander through all of the rooms and then go back to spend more time at our favorites - we finished well before the two hour limit. You ARE allowed to take pictures (just no flash). Expect to stand online for quite awhile to pick up your reserved tickets. By limiting the number of visitors present at any one time, the museum never feels too crowded. The day we were there, they were sold out - I imagine that probably happens quite a bit, so make sure you reserve tickets in advance. After visiting the museum, you can then spend time wandering through the gardens and surrounding area - absolutely beautiful. It is well worth the price of admission - the Bernini sculptures alone are too beautiful to describe with words - and there is so much more there than Bernini. Nice gift shop. Bathrooms on site. Cafeteria there also but not much in way of selection (and plenty of places relatively near by you can eat before or afterwards)"

Our visit was slightly spoiled due to a morning strike by the workers. I had bought advance tickets months ago, but upon showing up at the designated time, a sign was posted notifying of the strike, and advising to return at one. When we returned, the line was 200 meters long, but upon opening, moved pretty quickly. The small group ahead of us in line proved the need for advance tickets, they had none, and after standing in the line, were turned away. The gallery is noted for its diversity and did not disapoint on this vist. The wall murals, the beautiful art, the graceful statures, all made this a great visit. One sad note, perhaps due the drought, the gardens were in a state of disrepair, I remember them as beautiful on my previous visits.Get your reserved tickets and make this a must stop whilst in Rome."

Not real easy to get to and you need to book way in advance to secure a time slot. They allow you inside for 2 hours, which is more than enough. But it might take an hour each way to get here from your hotel. I don't think it's the 'knock your socks off' museum that most people rate it as, but it's good. And it's compact, which I like. Nothing bores me more than huge galleries with endless corridors of meaningless art, along with the few gems. Have good stuff, keep it small and simple."

Besides the sculptures and paintings, the villa is also worth-seeing. After visiting the museum, take a walk in the gardens of Villa Borghese, too."

Marco was very professional, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the art he was showing us. It was not easy keeping everyone entertained as we had a late afternoon tour on a very hot day and the Gallery has very few rooms that are air conditioned. We would recommend tours in the morning on the hot days during the summer. Eight of our group dropped off after the gallery tour, leaving just two couples and Marco for the tour of the Park area. Like I mentioned earlier, this was the first of three tours (Breakfast @ the Vatican and Tour of Coliseum at Night) with City Wonders over the next two days; all of the tours were fantastic. There was so much to see and take in and only a limited time to visit. We plan on bringing my folks back next year and sharing the same tour with them.If you want a great experience while you are visiting in Rome, book some tours with City Wonders."

The Borghese Gallery in Rome is one place where you MUST plan ahead especially if visiting in the busy tourist season. Advanced reservations are required. Time slots are two hours with the first at 9 am. The good news is that the number of people allowed in during a time slot is somewhat limited - about 350 people - so the Gallery never feels really crowded. We had an 11 am time and got there early to enjoy the gardens a bit before going in. The gardens are huge and one could spend an entire day there although, despite the shade, it can get hot. Plan to arrive at the Gallery at least a half hour before allowed time and bring your passport for identification. I almost didn't get in even though I had a confirmation number. The interior itself is stunning - a mini Versailles. The Borgheses were an affluent and very wealthy family. Pope Julius II of Sistine Chapel fame was a Borghese. The art depicts mostly religious themes and some pieces - particularly the Rafaels - are impressive. The BIG draw are the sculptures. Some of Bernini's masterpieces are housed here including his version of the David, Apollo and Daphne and the Rape of Proserpina. Unbelievable!The outdoor garden behind the house is somewhat charming but ill kept. Check out the transportation situation carefully. We found it easy to get there by bus nut not so easy returning. This is one of Rome's highlights but you have to really want to go since it is a bit off the beaten track."

Villa borghese is located somewhat outside of the city center, but travelling by subway to Spagna and walking the rest is no problem. If you have to wait some time before your time slot, the caffetaria has really good prices!

It also balances out the somewhat repetitive (though still engaging) nature of ruins and churches that stretch out across Rome.The location is not far from Piazza di Spagna and, if you decide to dine in that area, do consider Ciampini Ristorante (look for my review here on Trip Advisor).Sadly, with the temp on our visit day topping 100 F, we did not take time to stroll through the gardens."

If you enjoy these, make sure you find your way to the National Roman Museum near Termini Station for more beautiful mosaic works of art.

Two hours is also enough to get through the gallery, although I would like to go back to have more time to appreciate better what is there. Photos were allowed.

The upside of this is that even in peak season, this was one of the few attractions that wasn't completely overcrowded."

The fact that they limit the number of guests who can visit at a time is part of the pleasure of the place. We reserved online ahead of time and it was easy to pick up tickets at the start of the visit. We also used the audio guide and would recommend it. Be careful not to spend all your time on the first floor, as your 2 hours will pass quickly and they begin to ask people to leave after 1 hour and 45 minutes. We hardly had time to see the paintings in the last few rooms. The sculptures are very accessible in the middle of the rooms, so you can see them from all sides. The surrounding park is a bonus!"

You absolutely MUST book your tickets in advance and I highly recommend heading upstairs to see the paintings first, then go back down and really see the first floor sculptures in a leisurely way. The works in this place are incredible but the estate itself rivals those works. We had seen the Donatello and Michaelangelo David's in Florence but Bernini's masterpiece was our favorite! Capturing motion and concentration in marble...it was stupendous! The Borghese is well-organized and fascinating. Highly recommended!"

There was a sign outside the day we visited advised no tickets till May 7th, (this was April 27th). The reason for this is they restrict the number of people in the galleries in 2 hourly slots. That way it is never crowded and you can stand and admire the art, statues and furnishings without being caught in a steady flow of tourists. The contents of the Villa are outstanding! And the painted ceilings are simply stunning. Use the audio guide to fully appreciate it. Outside the parkland is a quiet oasis in a bustling city. Families were hiring bicycles and touring the wide avenues,others picnicking, there is a special area for roller blades showing off their skills and a couple of Mini-trains traversing the huge park if you get too tired. A wonderful place to visit."

The Building itself and its contents are really great. We really enjoyed them.There were some intangibles however- in no particular order:- we had a 1:00 entry time and we got there at 12:40 and asked if we could go in. Firm no . Maybe they close for lunch? Off topic: a VW dealer in my town used to close for lunch- they went bankrupt. Picasso Museum in Barcelona said no problem in a similar situation. So we went back outside. At 1245 a crowd formed at the top level steps where earlier people had been going in and out but now there was an iron bar gate closed. people in the crowd started yelling loudly to someone inside who would only yell back, not come into view at the gate (why not come to the gate and explain?), After about 10 minutes of this and continued yelling back and forth they stuck out an old looking sign that said enter on the first level so the crowd moved there and waited til 1:00. Why no sign earlier?- Just before this we went in the cafe which seemed staffed with rushed abrupt almost unfriendly staff.(My opinion)- when we went in at 1:00 we went in a second or 3rd floor room, and got confused using the audio guide. A nice attendant came over and asked if she could help- I said yes we cant find the numbers in this room (numbers for the audio guide keys) She looked around the room and said yes some are missing, she told us what the numbers were, I thought why not get an index card and tape on some numbers until the permanent ones are replaced?- air conditioning- A very hot day and I though the AC was doing fine, they had many portable dehumidifiers in use and two mecahnics working on one wall AC unit. one of the floors either 2nd or 3rd when you entered seemed very humid. when we went over to the far side the attendant had two 7 ft high windows fronting on the garden fully open, with a 10 mile per hour breeze blowing in, 15 minutes of that and the Air cond will take hours to catch up.- they have toilets off the main stair well and I went in to use them, mans side. Clean and neat but no toilet seat, just the china rim of the bow, They had a toilet paper roll so I guess they wanted you to sit on the bowl. I did not need to do anything serious , just thought it odd, maybe broken seat on the mens side- I asked my wife who said the womens side was the same - no toilet seat. All the Rome restaurants seemed to have toilet seats. Maybe it was a turkish influence aka pit toilets. A guide at the coloseum I asked thought it might be to save money on cleaning it. ??!! Learn to squat or bring your own seat.- near the end my audio guide locked up and I went downstairs to exchange it, going out the entrance I said \"my audio guide is broken I want to exchange it\", the woman said you only have 30 more minutes, I took that to mean why bother just stay out, but I went over and exchanged it, the attendant tossed it in a pile of 15 other ones to be reissued.- about 15 minutes before the 2 hours end time shown on the ticket (you are only allowed in for 2 hours, they started making announcement to leave. At that time they were only a few people left. I asked an attendant on the way out why they run all the people out when only a few are left, she said for security reasons, I asked what security reasons then she says because of insurance rules. ??"

Better than a great art museum, in my opinion, The Borghese is the story of a family of collectors and fascinating characters.Entrance is by ticket on a timed tour and well worth the effort to secure them. I can't imagine touring this gallery amid a crush of tourists. With limited access, it is possible to view the individual works in a close and very personal way. The mosaics, the Greek and Roman sculptures and the paintings speak of a highly personal taste.The highlight of the Borghese collection has to be the amazing statues created by Bernini. These statues are so fragile that they do not travel. I had difficulty understanding why until I stood before his sculpture of Apollo and Daphne, looking at light filtering through delicately carved leaves, or looking up at Pluto's hand pressing against the soft flesh of Proserpina's thigh. His interpretation of David, readying his sling to use against Goliath. Not the standard David, the perfection of manhood, Bernini's statue is of a small young man with an expression on his face that displays the variety of emotions that would obviously transform him, rather than the passive gaze of Michelangelo's more famous sculpture.And then there is Canova's noted sculpture of Pauline Bonaparte Borghese, another famous occupant of this beautiful villa in Rome. Stunning."

It's a small, manageable museum with the most amazing artwork situated in a lovely, sprawling park. I suggest arriving 30-45 minutes before your booked slot so you have enough time to pick-up your tickets, explore the garden and take pictures, deposit your things in their locker and pick-up an audioguide. Their audioguide is excellent, you don't need to book a guide for this visit. You only have two hours but for us this was enough. Once inside, proceed to the second floor first while the rest of your party crowds the first floor so there will be less crowds when it's your turn to visit the first floor. I like that there is an effort to control the number of people so you can appreciate the art more. It's always pleasing to see artwork in its natural habitat in contrast to the curated work in other museums. There are a number of exquisite art work here but my favorites were the sculptures of Bernini. I marveled at the details, tension and movement in his work. As you go around the sculpture of Apollo and Daphne, you can see the story unfold as Daphne turns into a tree. In Pluto and Proserpina, you can see the indentation created by Pluto's fingers in Proserpina's marble thighs and the tears and anguish on her face. All in marble. Unbelievable. Go!"

I find myself mesmerized by the beautiful pieces! Book in advance, show up on time, you usually have a time range to enter. They have lockers to store your things, and a snack shop as well. You can see it in a few hours, depending on your admiration of the pieces. The first time we went photography was not allowed, but this last time it was! The grounds are lovely as well.

Although you are allowed to take your phone and take pictures inside. The staff here is nt very friendly, not willing to help and not eager to please guests!

So special that there is a limit to the number of people that can go there, and a limit to the time they can spend there. Given horrific experiences in places like the Palace of Versailles, this sounds like a terrific idea. Too bad it feels like you're being treated like a nuisance - and too bad the crowds to get in and around the gallery's rooms, which are sometimes quite cramped, don't seem to reflect the limits. That said, the collection is in places excellent. As my diary of the event says, \"the gallery includes a goodly number of artists, including our old friends Bronzino, Raffaello, Botticelli, Del Sarto, Bartolomeo, Carreggio, Parmigianino, Carracci and Veronese. But as usual it's the sculptures, especially Bernini and Canova, that steal the show. Canova's 'Paolina Borghese Bonaparte' reclining on an amazingly life-like mattress is sublime, and Berninini's 'David' is also spectacular.'So where's the grate from the title? The fact that there is, on a balcony tucked out of the way, a piece of marble carved at the behest of the original owner, that says, in part: 'Go wherever you want to, ask for whatever you desire, leave whenever you wish...the owner forbids the imposition of rigid rules.'Try trotting that one out when you're being unceremoniously booted out because your allotted two hours are up."

Then I would have gone in to see the gallery. I would do it the other way around if the place held my picnic basket for us. They do take your bags and hold them for you. Definitely get the audio recording. Makes it a whole lot more interesting. My favorite was hearing the story surrounding some of the statues like Pauline Bonaparte and of Prosperina being abducted by Pluto. The Bonaparte marble looks like a real bed or wrinkled cloth that she's reclining on. We couldn't stop looking at it. I do wish, however, that there was more audio for more of the paintings, which were fascinating. I wanted to know the stories behind those, too. I am planning on going through the internet and reading up on some of them. There's nothing like seeing these figures in person though. Do book in advance and don't show up too early because they won't let you in. You may go downstairs to check in your bags and lounge around for awhile, but trying to enter the galleria itself won't be permitted. After the galleria (about an hour at the most), walk throughout the park. We discovered a large pond with a Greek-like statue setting in the center and people rowing about. We also wish we would have rented one of the those multi-person's bike to traipse around in the park. They had four people sitting in this buggy-like thing, pedaling, relaxing and enjoying themselves."

Some by Lanfranco are as good as exceptional as the paintings hanging on the walls.- Best spent 11 euros ever; Relatively inexpensive for museums in RomeGood to know:- It's worth knowing what you're looking at here: The Borghese Gallery guide is phenomenal with beautiful color photos and explanations for each item in the collection. As an alternative, read Rick Steves' summary or Wikipedia it!- You MUST reserve ahead unless you get super lucky and are there when a tour begins and somebody with a reservation did not show. Book online or by phone.- Entrance to pick up tickets is at the center/front of the building underneath the staircase.- You must pick up your reserved tickets ahead of time. Come 15-30 mins early.- You will be asked to check in large items, including most purses.- Photography is permitted, so do not check your camera/ phone with your bag- Viewing time is strictly limited to 2h. You will be kicked out when that time ends.- You will not have time to see everything, so be wise with your time (or reserve a 2nd...or 3rd...or nth visit)-Downstairs is mostly sculpture, both Baroque and ancient-Upstairs is mostly paintings and frescoes; This is also the best place to start because the crowd generally flows in the opposite direction- There is a huge staircase to 2nd floor and no lift in sight.- There is a cafe at the entrance, but you will not be allowed to bring any liquids into the gallery with you."

            "review": "Best museum we visited - take your time!. If you have read any articles/reviews of this museum, you already know it is spectacular. It is manageably small, filled with treasures, and the museum/rooms themselves are spectacular. Here are some tips:1) Yes, you need to purchase your tickets online in advance. The museum only lets so many people in at a time, in two hour visits. It DOES sell out at times.2) Because of the two hour time limit, you will be tempted to push to the front of the line and rush through so you don't miss anything. DON'T DO THIS. When we went, after about 60-70 minutes, most of the people had left, having checked off their list of items to see. For the rest of the two hours, there were only about 20 visitors scattered around the museum's 22 rooms. So I sometimes had a priceless work of art, and its room, to myself. 2a) In other words, plan on staying the entire two hours, and take your time at first. In fact, why not sit down and enjoy a capuccino in the cafe for the first 10 minutes? This is a small museum, and you can easily see all the highlights in under two hours. Only a serious, scholarly devoted art afficianado will need more than 90-110 minutes or so here, and the first several minutes are crowded, as noted above.3) Do a little homework. Although most of the works are simply visually stunning, the back stories add so much more to your enjoyment. What's with that weird dog at the foot of the Rape statue? Why is that girl growing out of a tree? How did the young lady lying topless on the chaise lounge feel about posing, and who was her brother anyway? 3a) So before you go in, I would recommend either: buy the Museum Guide at the book store; at least read the Rick Steves description/guide; or get the excellent and affordable audio guide available just before you go in.4) Decide: are you more of a sculpture or a painting person? Then allot most of your time to the appropriate floor.5) If you are someone who likes to buy souvenirs in the gift shop, be aware the shop closes at or right around the closing time of the last tour of the day. So either hit the gift shop first (difficult because you haven't seen the museum yet and may not know what you want to buy), or don't book the last visit of the day.Final thought: I am not an art buff. We visited the Vatican Museums, the Uffizi/Bargello/Accademia in Florence, and more. This was my favorite museum of the trip. Worth the time and entry fee."

The two hours of the timed ticket goes very fast. We started on the second floor picture gallery and listened to most of the audio commentary (extra charge). It was well worth it, but hard to find at times. The pictures were amazing - some of the best we've seen.

No problem getting the time slot we wanted (11am) and having the tickets delivered meant we knew we would be OK to get in without any problems. The price was pretty good I thought, though they do add on a few extras such as a 'pre-sale fee' of \u20ac2.00 per ticket, a service fee of \u20ac4.00, and I paid \u20ac1.30 for ticket insurance. I also paid \u20ac19.99 delivery charge, but since the tickets arrived so quickly that was worth it.

The Borghese is an art gallery that features renaissance painters such as Raphael, Titian and religious painters, including Peter Paul Reubens. There are also Barocci's and Bernini's in the collection. The star of the gallery is Caravaggio, who is well represented in the collection by his Boy with a Basket of Fruit.BIG TIP!! You must have a reservation to come here! Because of the complexity of the collection it is smart to come by a reputable tour group. They will get a ticket and advance you to the front of the line.

About a 10 minute walk and dead ends at the Borghese Gallery. The doors opened this AM at 8:30, at which point we queued for tickets (everyone had a reservation - no \"walk up\" tickets available. Then we waited in the entrance hall to be let into the gallery at 9am all together. Save your ticket stub if you want to use toilets after your gallery visit - must show it to use facilities. It's possible to use toilets and get something to drink while waiting in the hall for the 9am opening. We took our own water bottle but had to check it at the coat check. Where comfy shoes - floors are all marble. At 11am, the guards will say, \"Please exit now.\" Enjoy!"

Why send out vouchers stating an entry time of 1pm and then kick everyone out because of a staff meeting? Not good enough and we weren't the only unhappy people. We were told to come back at 3pm but in my experience people plan their time carefully in Rome so this wasn't possible for us.If you do go the leave plenty of time to collect tickets, hand in handbags etc. Go and see the Doria Pamphili palace instead.

We opted for the 11am visit, but I'd recommend the 9am visit, due to the heat in the summer months and increasing number of guests. Be prepared to form a line -- 4 steps are required to gain access on time so arrive early. 1. To pick up tickets at the front desk, only 2 staff members available to assist (bring online voucher). 2. To pick up your audio guide (need a form of ID such as drivers license to rent). 3. To check a purse or camera bag. It doesn't matter how small, you must check these items. Personal items such as passports, wallets and cell phone must be placed in a clear 1 qt sized bag with handles that may be carried inside. 4. Line up at the entrance to the 1st floor of the gallery to gain access at the exact time of tour. Look for brochures in different languages near the entrance. The 2 hour time limit is strictly enforced. To avoid crowds, we went straight to the painting floor (2nd floor) and toured, by the time we finished, the crowds had thinned out on the 1st floor and we were able to get close enough to the sculptures to appreciate the fine details of Bernini's work.It is very hot inside, no A/C to speak of. A hand held fan will help. No flash photography permitted. Bring a bottle of water to drink inside."

I visited the gallery last Friday and it was completely booked for the next four days. I also read that I should arrive at least an hour in advance to pick up my ticket (when you book online, you have to print out the email and the receipt to collect your ticket at the gallery), however there was no line to pick up my ticket at all, and I ended up waiting around for about 45 minutes until everyone began gathering to enter the gallery at the allotted time. Also, no bags are allowed, so the gallery provides a small plastic bag for your cellphone, camera, wallet, keys, and then you check you bag for free and pick up when you finish. I did see several people bringing in bags, so not quite sure how much this rule is actually enforced. Each ticket is good for 2 hours. Once everyone entered (exactly at the time on the ticket and not earlier), we were ushered upstairs to the second floor where all of the paintings are. While I enjoyed the paintings, the sculptures on the first floor are incredible, so make sure to give yourself plenty of time for the first floor if you enjoy sculptures. Lastly, I booked my ticket myself directly through the museum and did not rent an audio guide (available at the gallery). I assumed that I could simply read descriptions in front of each painting/sculpture - however there aren't any! There are laminated cards available in each room that provide some detail, but I wish I had either purchased a guide book for myself or rented an audio guide."

It houses a good number of Bernini's masterpieces in his early ages, including The Rape of Proserpina, Apollo and Daphne, David, and etc. Collections of Caravaggio are also outstanding, including Young Sick Bacchus, Boy with a Basket of Fruits, David with the Head of Goliath. Apart from Baroque arts, the gallery also has a variety of collections covering Renaissance to Neo-Classical Arts, e.g. Raphael's Lady with a Unicorn, Titian's Sacred and Profaned Love, and Canova's Pauline Bonaparte. You must make a reservation for the visit, which can be done either online or via phone. The gallery is open every two hours to a fixed number of visitor. If your reservation is for 9am, then you can enter the gallery at anytime from 9-11, but you have to leave exactly at 11am. Roma Pass can be used for the gallery with no extra booking fees. Historically cameras were not allowed, but now you can take pictures as you wish, as long as there is no flash. Recommended route would be to start from the second floor to avoid the crowd, but it would be better to leave enough time (slightly more than an hour), so that you can enjoy the stunning sculptures downstairs."

If using the Roma pass, I believe you can only reserve by phone. Book at least a week ahead. It's best to go at 9 am before the place starts heating up. It takes at least 20 minutes to walk from the Spagna metro stop and you can get lost if you don't pay attention and/or stop passersby for directions. You may read that you must be there 30 minutes ahead or risk losing your reservation, but when we went it took them nearly 30 minutes to process everyone that was on line at 8:30. So shoot to be there at 8:30, but don't panic if you are running a few minutes late. Consider taking a taxi, as well, to avoid the angst of potentially getting lost.You will only be allowed 2 hours in the gallery, but that is plenty for the average person. The audio guide is interesting but not really necessary. I found the sculpture and room decoration as compelling as the paintings. Allow time in your schedule to wander in the park after you exit the gallery."

My parents went at Easter time a few years ago and they did not book and were able to go in so I assume it is more the summer that it is an issue. However I would recommend checking out the booking system to see if there are available spaces in advance to have an idea. The main website for the Borghese does not warn you about this and so it is very easy to remain in the dark about this and then be disappointed!

His famous works here include David, Pluto and Persephone, and Apollo and Daphne. They are remarkable for sculptures in that in spite of being static, they tell a story. I think Bernini version of David is the best. There is much else to like.Be sure to order your tickets early; at least a week in advance for weekends. Be on time. Some guide books say that photos aren't allowed; actually, flash free photography is permitted. After departing, enjoy the walk across the villa. Plaza del Popolo at the other end is worth visiting.

The tickets have a timeframe for the visit, however the administration of the villa had to have a meeting that day and , after waiting a couple of hours in a very long line in a hot sunny day we were pushed in with another group, that made this a body-to- body experience. Worth visiting, but pick up a different month. Summer in Rome is not fun, and the city is quite dirty."

            "review": "Fabulous Renaissance Villa and Bernini sculptures. We recently visited Galleria Borghese for the 4th time. It is the most enjoyable presentation of Renaissance art and sculpture that I have experienced in all of Italy. My strategy to ensure maximum enjoyment of the main Bernini works is to linger in the main hall and study the room and works there, then proceed to the next few rooms after the initial crowd has moved on. A better strategy, if you have the patience, is to first go upstairs to the paintings gallery, then come down to the main level for the sculptures. Toward the end of your two hour visit window, you will have most of the rooms almost to yourself.The first room after the main hall has a wonderful Canova sculpture of Pauline, sister of Napoleon. Note the detail of the mattress. In the next few rooms the works of Gian Lorenzo Bernini are just wonderful. Note the intensity of the subjects, the facial expressions, the flowing robes, and texture of skin and hair. See if you can see light through some of the leaves of the Apollo and Daphne. One of the pleasures of Galleria Borghese is that one can stand and study all the details and intricacies of a sculpture without crowds interfering with the enjoyment. The number of visitors is limited for each two hour visit window. I highly recommend the audio guide. It will greatly add to your understanding and appreciation of the Borghese collection. I also recommend a little pre-trip research on the history and content of the gallery.Non-flash photos are now allowed which is a big plus."

            "review": "Do the Audio Guide!. I am not an art buff, but I had seen a lot of great things about the Borghese Gallery and figured I should visit it while in Rome. It was very enjoyable overall. You definitely want to buy tickets ahead of time. I went from 5 pm-7 pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't insanely crowded which was nice. They do not allow any bags in the gallery (which the staff member veeery rudely informed me of) but they have a bag check for free near the ticket desk. Do it before you get in line to enter so that you don't have to get out of line, check your bag, then back in the entrance line.The audio guide was well worth the money. The pieces are clearly labelled with corresponding numbers, and the map that you get is helpful in determining where you are in the gallery.The rooms are numbered with little hanging pendants as you walk through the doorway- look up at them and you'll have an idea of where you are on your map, otherwise the museum is confusing! The cafe and bookstore close before the gallery closes, so if you have the last time slot like I did, 5-7, you need to go to the bookstore before you go into the museum, otherwise it'll be closed when you're leaving. I wouldn't recommend the gallery for young children, but it was a great use of a few hours of my time in Rome!"

When we went on June 3, 2015, the next available day was June 9. Having said that, the Italian way is to see if you can still go in, even though the sign says all sold out for today. (If you're a small group of 1-2, you could try) anyway, arrive 1/2 hour earlier coz there are so many things you need to do before you go into the museum for your 2-hour visit (they will usher you out to let the next group in!). Below the main entrance, there is a door with a couple of steps going down to it. Here is where you need to go first to exchange the voucher or confirmation # for the actual tickets. Then you need to check in all your baggage (back packs, large purses etc) The sign seems to say that you're not allowed to bring a camera but you can. You just can't use the flash. Their audio guide was decent. I learned a lot from it. Then once you do that and perhaps use their WC, you then go back outside to now climb up the stairs to go to the main entrance. You really only have 2 hours to finish your tour-there will be an announcement and then people will actually usher you out. The museum is completely emptied before the next group is let in. Have fun!! (Don't forget all the garden/park surrounding the museum) There are Segways, bikes, golf carts and electric cart for 2 or 4 with pedals for rent."

So enticing are the recommendations that I eventually booked this tour online in their website about a month before my visit in early May 2015. I liked their system in having limited no. of visitors for per 2 hour session after been to Vatican museum. One will have the peace and space, and sufficient time to admire each piece of excellent work by the masters. Although cameras are allowed inside the gallery, it is difficult to take pictures of the paintings due to the lighting system creating a lot of reflections. Good thing they have a book store in the basement should you fancy the art pieces in posters, book, magnet forms etc. for purchases. All bags have to be checked in before entry and there is a caf\u00e9 with limited seats for chow. Outside the gallery lies the massive but beautiful garden and water fountains with portable water. Taking bus 116 is recommended compared to taking metro to Spagna to this gallery due to it's extreme end location inside the Villa Borghese."

The museum draws such a crowd that you must have reservations and visits are limited to two hours. There are a number of Bernini sculptures and other art works. There are several differences from other museums. Pictures (without flash) were permitted. The windows were open, even with air conditioning, resulting in exposure to humidity and temperatures. This has caused some impact on some of the paintings (e.g. pulling away from the frame). Note that all bags larger than small purse must be checked. This museum provides an opportunity to get up close and personal with masterpieces from the Middle Ages. After the museum, take some time and tour the gardens and park for a relaxing experience with nature."

From the moment you enter the Gallery, you are mesmerized by the sculptures and paintings all around you. From Bernini to Botticelli to Tiziano to Domenichino to Caravaggio to Raffaello..........this villa is a treasure trove !Most important is to make a reservation prior to your visiting the Gallery and take your time slot for the trip and stick to it. If you change your mind after taking a 1300hrs slot and want to do it at 1100hrs, its not likely to happen and a couple infront of us got turned down for the same reason. Their website says one needs to call and book, however we sent them a mail from our country,and got a revert with a reservation number too. So that was convenient......Secondly, I recommend all to take the guided tour instead of the audio guide (its just Euro 1.5 more expensive, per person) since one really cannot spend the whole day at one's leisure out here, everyone gets a 2 hour slot for the tour. We decided to do the guided tour, instead of the audio tour, and were so glad that we did so. Our guide, Isabella was wonderful. Knowledgeable, she spoke with such passion about the sculptures and paintings and the creators of the same. It was as if each sculpture came to life with her explanation and each painting told us the story behind. She was fantastic ........And I would recommend if one has only time enough to do one Museum, choose Villa Borghese and you will have no regrets!"

Somewhat worth going to but not considering the complications of reservations in advance (which is NOT clearly stated online) and the proximity to other great European museums. You can do better!"

Colosseum, Capitoline Hill, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Gallery Borghese, this is the usual roster of Rome main attractions. Well, let's say that Borghese shall (arguably) top the list. Not only it offers one of the most amazing art collections in the world, very carefully and tastefully selected, but the collection is housed exactly where it was originally intended to be housed. The degree of preservation, and the upkeep is par excellence. We won't bore our fellow travellers with extensive/excessive details pertaining to the museum. Any guide book or reliable online source would suffice. We simply have to mention an uncomparable line-up of Bernini's sculptures, including several undisputable chef d'oeuvres. The works of Caravaggio, and specifically 'The Sick Bacchus' are first class, even for Caravaggio. Bellini, Leonardo, Rafael, Rubens, Titian, Veronese, Canova, you just got to see it all, Renaissance and Baroque alike.A few practical advices. First is how to get there. We got a bit concerned when Google Maps gave us 43 minutes' walk from our Piazza Navona hotel, so we used Uber (very unreliable in Rome). This was unnecessary, for a leisurely walk to or from Piazza del Popolo, made pleasant by the arbory shade, was a twenty minutes' breeze. Secondly, your visit is limited to two hours only. You can either book your tickets online (several sites offer Borghese tickets for sale, some do overcharge; we would recommend www.tosc.it, that we equally used for Castel sant'Angelo and other Roman attractions). We, however, opted for a small group tour; it is inexpensive and provides you with a thoughtful selection of a knowledgeable yet lively guide (at least such was our great guide Massimo). Venturing on your own, being limited to two hours only, may present a certain challenge.Can't recommend the attraction high enough."

It is set in beautiful gardens, there is access to food in the surrounding town, and it was a nice place to sit outside in the park and talk afterwards. Allow plenty of time.

Bernini's \"Rape of Proserpine\" and \"Apollo and Daphne\" alone are reasons to go. However be very conscious of the time allocation.First of all, don't even think of getting in without prior booking of a time slot and tickets. They will not entertain anyone without ticket reservations.I took the first slot of 9am-11am, was advised to arrive half hour earlier but the door only opened 5 minutes to 9. Then there's the line to get the physical ticket. After that we have to get in line to check the bag, no bags allowed no matter how small. And then back in line for the audio guide. By the time I am ready for the museum, 20 minutes are gone, and none of that was my fault.My suggestion is to be picky (really picky) on what you want to listen on the audio guide because if you are interested in most everything available on the guide, you will not get through the museum. The announcement that the 2 hour time slot is up came 15 minutes before 11. Mueseum staff started herding people out. When I tried to get a quick run through of what's left of the galleries, the staff started closing doors in my face. So effectively you get 1.5hours or less.A great museum, but not a friendly one. The surrounding park is very pleasant so I ended up spending the rest off my morning there."

It is a remarkable masterpiece. The other is Bernini's David - the twisted torso, the determination on his face and the slingshot about to be released. Bernini was an extraordinary sculptor.You cannot linger too long because at the end of the one hour and 30 minutes they clear the gallery.

As the gallery is cleared every two hours (actually less), when a group is admitted, some start up, and some down stairs. If you use the audio guide, you should be able to get through in time. They want a photo ID left as security for the audio guide, as with all museums we went to. I used an International Driver's License.

Walking up through Rome from the Termini you pass through one of the city's 'smart' areas where there are embassies, posh hotels, cafes and restaurants. Once into the Gardens you walk along tree line boulevards. There weren't many flowers out when we visited (May) but the trees afforded a welcome shade from the unusually hot sun. The Galleria - like a few others of the must see sites, currently has scaffolding round it, but it is inside where the spectacular starts. Entrance is only by pre-booked ticket which means numbers are controlled and you get 2 hours to view masses of art and sculpture by some of the most famous artists ever, such as Canova, Bernini, Caravaggio, Rapahel and Titian. You can get up close and have a good look. Photography was allowed but not flash. Take a look out of the windows as you pass through the galleries as you get good views of the formal gardens. After our visit we took the little road train, which for 3 euros takes you for quite a long ride through the Picio Gardens and sets down high above the Piazza del Popolo, where you get magnificent views over the city. You are not allowed to take bags, rucsacs etc round the gallery, but there is a free left luggage facility where your gear is locked up."

Some truly stunning pieces that you are likely to recognise from copies in any number of other galleries and museums around the world. Located in a pleasant Park tickets can be difficult to get in season and I would advise purchasing in advance of your visit. Tickets are for time slots so only valid between a particular 2/3 hour slot. May appear expensive until you get in then you realise this is a viewing you will never forget."

Bernini's sculpture of Apollo and Daphne executed in 1622-1625 when he was 24 years old is wonderful. Daphne is changed into a tree to escape and her fingers have turned inti delicate leaves. Loved Pauline Bonaparte lazing on her chaise- she looks so comfortable.Leave plenty of time to reach the entrance to the Museum and the 2 hour timeframe is strictly observed. A great spot to start your descent down the Spanish Steps about a 15 minute walk away. Hardly any crowd at the top of the steps but then you descend into chaos."

            "review": "Amazing. The Borghese Gallery is an art gallery located in the Villa Borghese in Rome, Italy. This huge park is located just north of central Rome and can be found by taking the metro to the Spagna station and then following the signs. After you leave the long metro tunnel it is a little confusing but just keep walking north about a block and you will run into the park. There are signs in the park that lead you to the only large white mansion inside the Park (the Borghese Gallery is inside this mansion). The Galleria Borghese houses a large part of the Borghese Collection of sculptures and paintings begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese (nephew of Pope Paul V). Cardinal Borghese was a huge art collector and built this mansion to house his collection. Part of the collection (about 500 pieces) was sold by his heirs to Napoleon in 1807 and that art became an important part of the Louvre in Paris. I visited this amazing art museum at 9 AM on a Tuesday morning in mid-March with my wife and daughter and really enjoyed looking at the old mansion and the great art collection inside it. To enter you need a timed reservation and then only have 2 hours to see the entire museum until the next group of ticket holders enter and you are required to leave. I purchased our tickets on the gallery web site a few weeks before arriving in Rome. Since we had a 9 AM reservation it was not very crowded. The lines seemed much longer for the 11 AM reservations. The building is not very big so it is relatively easy to see the entire collection. We were done visiting this gallery in about 1:45 minutes.I rented an audio guide but my wife and daughter did not. I liked the audio guide tour but thought it gave way to much information. It was a little confusing as the paper building map they give you with your ticket uses a different room numbering system than the audio guide. After walking through a couple of rooms a woman saw that I was having trouble and showed me how the audio guide number system worked (she was also confused but eventually figured it out). I am not sure why the audio guide did not just use the numbering system used in the paper map. Overall I really enjoyed this amazing art gallery and also liked touring the mansion (as it was also a work of art). The many Bernini sculptures were the highlight of the gallery. I really enjoyed looking at the two Busts of Scipione Borghese by Bernini. He sculpted the first one and then found a flaw in the marble so easily made an identical second copy. We passed small groups of people taking guided tours with professional tour guides and they seemed to be getting lots of information. Afterwards we walked around the entire building and walked through the small garden in the back. You can also look at the old birdhouse (a small building on the side with two large wire roofs). After touring the garden we spent some time walking through the Villa Borghese."

Basically we waited and eventually managed to get a couple of 'no show' tickets. Entrance numbers are strictly controlled, and only by having a reservation can you be sure of getting in. On the first Sunday of the month entrance is free, but a reservation is still necessary, and these free days book even further ahead. The exhibits are stunning, in particular we loved the Bernini sculptures - the Apollo and Dafne, and the Rape of Proserpina were breathtaking.

Luckily i was able to book via Viator for 30\u20ac/person. We payed by card, no printed voucher needed, got there, met with the guide (you must be there 15 minutes prior to the admission hour) and got the tickets.Before we entered i saw the price printed on the ticket (11\u20ac/person) and felt i had been scamed having payed 30\u20ac/person, but the second we got in I saw a large sign saying they were fully booked until 19.05 (we visited on 12.05) and I felt instant relief and joy for being inspierd enough to buy the tickets online.As for the Gallery itself: OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING!~We fell in love with this ceiling"

Nothing can top the collections in the Vatican-It must have been very good indeed to be Pope-but it is the quality of the experience that makes the Borghese my number one recommendation for art lovers. The Vatican sells tickets in unlimited numbers and puts 40,000 through in a day. Going there and trying to see through the tour groups is like riding the New York subway at rush hour. Seeing the Sistine Chapel crowded like sardines in a huge can with constant amplified voices calling for silence and no pictures was not fun. If you can afford it by all means go with an early entry tour. Besides one of the world's greatest art collections, what makes the Borghese stand out for me is the careful, limited and controlled entry.300 people max with a strict two hour limit. Every two hour shift people are ushered out so the next block of people with tickets can have a quality experience. We booked a tour with Walks of Rome-highly recommended. The experienced and knowledgeable guide had the visit timed Down to the minuet , knew how to dodge the other tour groups to be sure of good looks and made sure you got a chance to see all the really important pieces. Otherwise I would have run out of time just walking around and marveling at David or Apollo and Daphne or The Rape of Proserpine or Truth Unveiled By Time, caught in awe, of the genius of Bernini .We were so glad we made the required reservation in March by booking the tour before leaving the US for our early-April visit. The box office had a sigh up-\"No tickets until May 5th.\" when we were there.The Vatican makes sure late comers can get in-and maximizes their biggest single source of revenue-while the Borghese resists the financial incentive to insure a quality experience -but you do need to plan ahead during tourist season."

There were several disappointed people who showed up thinking they could get in and were told the next available space was the following week!- The gallery is deep in the park so allow at least half and hour to walk in from a metro stop.

I recommend getting an audio guide as it gives more context to the art and helps you understand/admire it more."

            "review": "Collection of a lifetime. While this museum is a bit of trouble to get into to, it is worth it. Visitors must book tickets as much as a month out. There will rarely if ever be tickets available on a walk in basis. And, visitors only have 2 hours to explore. That's it. I could have stayed twice that long. Having studied some of these works 20+ years ago, and having loved them all my life, it was a dream come true to be standing right in front of them. Absolutely overwhelming.The Roman mosaics on the floor were super cool. Very impressive to see such ancient art, preserved for hundreds of years this way.However, I was very disappointed in the lighting of the oil paintings. I am from a mid sized midwestern city in the US, and even us hicks know how to properly light a painting like a Caravaggio or a Titian. In the Gallerie Borghese, the paintings are often lit with a single flood lamp, which creates a big glare spot, making it impossible to enjoy the whole painting at once. I had to walk around and get a bunch of different vantage points, and then try to reconstruct the whole thing in my mind. It was a bummer for me.And why are visitors allowed to take flash photographs of these priceless treasures? This does not sound right.But even with that, I don't think there is anything man made that is more beautiful than some of these Italian masters' works. The sculptures were literally breath taking. Bernini was the real deal, ya'll. Apollo & Daphne will just boggle your mind. It doesn't even look like marble, because the textures are so super realistic. Look at their fingers. And their mouths. The figures look like they are about to turn their heads and look at you and say, \"Aren't we gorgeous????\"Really dug the Paolina Borghese Venus Victrix by Canova, too. The picture gallery upstairs was pretty impressive, too, but could have also benefitted from some better lighting and better organization... some works were jammed up very close to each other, others were so spread out or high up on a wall it was hard to see them.Audio tour was pretty good. That really helps visitors get the most out of what they are looking at. I highly recommend buying tickets for this museum if you are going to be in Rome for a few days or more.The park around the museum looks great for picnicking, or walking, or people watching."

Most of the paintings are upstairs, and frankly it can be an overwhelming amount of art. I do wish I had used one of the audio guides as the pamphlets out front just give a bit of map of the rooms without much additional information, but even without the guide any art lover should be able to appreciate the gallery. There are books in the gift shop that delve into more detail about each piece (also books for children, prints, jewelry, and a handful of Bernini figurines). The work on the ceilings is absolutely breathtaking, and the second floor is much less crowded than the first, so we started there and worked our way back down. Photography is prohibited, though everyone around me seemed to be flashing pictures (even though cameras were supposed to be checked?) and none of the staff moved to stop them. Bag check is also compulsory, so I didn't bring one--from what I saw it looked as though they were all locked in a single bin so I'm not sure how that really worked. There's also a small cafeteria next to the bookshop.Beyond the gallery, enjoy the rest of the huge park! Our tickets were for 5:00 PM so we walked from our hotel to the park after lunch and spent the afternoon just wandering around and people watching. The zoo is in the same area of the grounds as well."

Once off the train we exited the turnstiles and walked until sign over side tunnel said Villa Borghese and Via Veneto. Follow the Via Veneto signs!!!! You will travel along moving sidewalks and a few escalators. Hope they are working because sometimes they don't. When you have finally reached the top (Via Veneto) pass through the ancient wall, cross the street, follow the signs to GALLERY Borghese. On our way back, we retraced but instead of the tunnel of escalators, walked straight down the Via Veneto to metro Barberini."

The fact that the number of visitors are limited really allows you to gasp in and admire the beauty of the artworks. The setting is very fine. You can also enjoy a very nice cafe at the same place while waiting for your visit time, they had the best white chocolate muffins that I have ever tasted. After you are done, you can enjoy the rest of the day walking in the park. (Trust me you will not be disappointed). You can walk to flaminio area too which is a very vibrant part of the city."

You must book your ticket ahead of time and you will be able to print off a voucher. When you get to the Gallery - arriving 20 minutes prior to your scheduled time - go down the stairs at the front entrance to redeem your voucher for your ticket. Punctuality is essential - you have exactly two hours to enjoy the gallery. There is a waiting area and a counter at which to check your bags and cameras. You will be told that cameras are not allowed, however, after we checked our cameras we saw almost everyone on the tour with their cameras in tow and they weren't told to put them away. As Rick Steeve advises, do the upstairs (Art Gallery) first where you are limited to 30 minutes. Most people do the sculptures first ( main floor) so by going upstairs first it is less crowded. The Villa itself is a work of art so make sure you look at the building itself. We just love walking through the beautiful Borghese parks and to the lake; you won't believe you're in the middle of Rome it's so quiet."

The paintings and sculptures by artists such as Bernini, Caravaggio,and Raphael are overwhelming!The collection, I believe, was organized by one of the Popes who was a Borghese. Each room is adorned with floor to ceiling treasures. The frescoes are amazing. You do require a reservation in order to view the collection as only a certain number of people are allowed in at a time and your visit is limited to a 2 hour time frame. There is a fee to get into the museum but if you have a Roma Pass, the cost is free. If you are travelling by bus, the #92 bus from Termini Station will take you to and drop you off at a stop near the museum; however, it does not stop near the Borghese for the return trip to Termini. The museum attendants will be able to give you directions how to get to the main road where numerous buses run and if you are staying at a hotel near Termini Station, just hop on any one that indicates it will stop at Termini. A great experience."

We visit it on Saturday; the tickets were sold out until Thursday. Reserve your tickets online prior your visit; we did it a month ahead. Take bus 910 (platform L) in front of Termini (train station). Request a bus to stop when you see the park on the left. It is wise to arrive on time. If you are late, you are wasting your time because the announcement will ask you to leave the gallery exactly at the time stated on your ticket."

Perhaps foolishly, my wife and I purchased Roma passes in advance over the internet, and the first attraction we hoped to use them on for free (already paid for) was the Borghese Gallery. Upon arrival at our hotel in Rome on Tuesday, Mar 31st, I asked our concierge to call the gallery and make reservations for us. After a lengthy exchange, the person assisting us at our hotel informed us that the earlist reservations would be available would be the following week, Apr 6th or later...but if we wished, my wife and I could go to the gallery, arriving 10 to 15 minutes prior to entry times, and standby for entry. We arrived at 12:45am for the 1:00 entry, and after standing in line for several minutes, we were told that we could purchase tickets for the 3:00 entry at 22euros, but no guarantee we would be allowed to enter. The fact that I had already paid 22euros with my Roma passes was of absolutely no consequence. A simple \"I'm sorry, I just can't help you\" would have gone a LONG way. I still would like to see the contents of the gallery on a future visit to Rome, but I will forever have a very bad taste in my mounth due to the personnel working there.

First of all, the collection is not too large so it is not overwhelming. Secondly, it is displayed in a home ( too grand to call it an intimate setting) which makes the art seem more approachable somehow. It reminded me somewhat of the feeling of the Frick Collection in New York. The art is also not exclusively religious so it makes for a very interesting collection. The Bernini sculptures here are the most spectacular sculptures I have ever seen and they are so easy to see. His Apollo and Danae(Daphne) is breathtaking and his David is so beautiful. Helpful hints: You must reserve tickets for a specific time well in advance of your trip as this place sells out fast. They allow only a limited number of people in at a time for only two hours at a time which is more than enough time). Also you must get there at least a half hour before your scheduled time or they will give away your ticket and it is VERY HARD to find in the park. Make sure you ask for the Galleria, not the Villa if you are asking for directions. Allow yourself 15 minutes once you get to the park to find the Galleria as it is in the north east corner of the park and if you walk from the Spanish steps you will arrive at the southwest corner."

You will only have two hours and it is necessary to be ready at the appointed time.We spent quite a long time around the grounds, which are huge and lovely, and full of people, including many runners and hundreds of small conveyances for individuals and families, including lots of \"segways\".The whole museum is on two floors of a 17th/18th Century Villa, and is packed with extraordinary sculpture and paintings. I do not see how anyone can take it all in in two hours but that is what you have; either you can be selective and pick out what you want to look at beforehand or you can wander around and spend as much time as you like in any given room, knowing that the crowd that came in with you may all also be there. We were jammed into a couple of rooms with everyone at first but an hour later, we found ourselves in a room with an Andrea del Sarto Madonna with Christ and John the Baptist by ourselves. The Caravaggio's are the featured highlight of the collection, but there are Raphaello's and Perugino's and Bernini's and so forth. You could spend all two hours looking at the statues, the bas reliefs or the ceilings and not even take in the exceptional paintings; it is that rich a collection. Two or three notes: you cannot carry in any sacks, backpacks, big bags, etc; you can take photos without flash and there is a small cafe downstairs for before and/or after.We were exhausted after just two hours but this is a place to remember."

You can only visit in 2 hour time slots and as we listened to the last explanation of an artwork in the last room of the Pinacoteca, visitors were asked to leave. We took our time getting around, so the audio guide timing was just PERFECT.- The limitation of visitors works perfectly. Never scenes like the ones you get in the Vatican museums, where you are herded along like a flock of sheep.- The Borghese park (always open to the public) is absolutely charming, and worth a good long stroll. Adds to your experience of this museum! From the park, head either direction Villa Medici for great views of Rome, or to the charming Piazza del Popolo (with magnificent art in the church)."

You get a sore neck from tipping it back to see the wonderful ceilings in every room. Floor lying space would be great!! The first floor is full of sculptures that require time to walk round and admire from every angle. The second floor has a rich collection of paintings. I was keen to see the Caravaggio collection. I did think though that the lighting did not always enhance the paints and it was difficult to get a good spot to view some."

It is small intimate collection of Baroque painting and sculpture with what is, so far as I know, the largest collection of Bernini everywhere. Despite the need for a reservation and a two hour visit limit, it is the very consumable nature of the collection which makes it most enjoyable. Unlike the Louvre ofr the Vatican one can actually do a superficial overview of the collection without being overwhelmed to the point of confusion and exhaustion. At the same time, if you find a Canova or a Carrivaggio that you love, there are no huge crowds to stop you from enjoying it for the duration of your visit. I will cintinue to return here as long as I am able"

There were several school groups in the same time that we booked that made it a moderately annoying experience. The museum does provide laminated cards for each room but they don't contain a lot of information about the work in the rooms.

You must check in all bags (including larger handbags). I took notice of the sign showing a line through a camera & left my Smartphone in my handbag - bad move, it only meant no flash photography so I missed all the very special digitised memories. One of the first things you see when you enter is a brilliant carousel which begins to move and as it speeds up it works on the principle of cartoons being flicked through in a booklet. You have the impression of gladiators & others fighting. I think it's the most memorable thing I've seen in a very long time. Read up on the Gallery before you go so you know a bit about the exhibits. We made the mistake of having lunch in their caf\u00e9 - it was the most confused service I have ever encountered & the meal was dreadful.

This is one of the unloosable beauty of Rome.The noble Palace of Borghese family itself could deserves a visit.It shows better than a lot of talks how the life of noble families was, and how they usued to live in and out in the Popes' society of those times.There are collected there a lot of wonderful pictures, I remember a stunning Tiziano, but it's only a sample: the walls are completely full of pictures from differents ages. The people of those times infact usued to collect beauties, but with the second intent to fill the empty walls of those, how says: we don't use a common paint or arazzi, but Tiziano, Caravaggio, etc.The arts collected by Prince Borghese include the world's famous Canova's statue: Paolina Borghese Bonaparte, the Napoleon's sister.But not only : there two amazing, incredible stautes by Bernini: the King of italian Barocco.Everything in that house screams ART!From the furnitures, to the marbles, the lamps, and some lovely mosaics from late Roman Empire: simply amazing, really incredible!For the mosaics' lovers I suggest a visit in another unloosable museum: Villa Massimo, in which there is only Art from Roman Empire, in front of Termini central railway Station .There are not only mosaics, from huge to atomic size, but original frescos from those times 2.000 years ago more or less. A collection of statues (Romans was lovers of statues) and finally a very very rare bronze statue: the boxeur. How this statue is made, what it rapresents, the ability of executions are something that you never have seen before, trust me! It is so real how the boxeur see you when you see him (after 2000 years), giving you a shock that is impossible to forget .Have a good visit.Aldo Martellip.s.next time Galleria Colonna"

We would not have learned or appreciated the art nearly as much without it. We talked about what we saw there for days afterwards! Note: they don't allow bulky bags or umbrellas, so there is a coat check room. We didn't need to do this but the line to pick up looked pretty long.

We tried to reserve tickets online but there was a huge fee so we walked to the museum at 11am and paid and reserved tickets for 5pm that evening without a fee for 3 people for 11 Euro each. (Depending on the time of year tickets are usually not available for the same day so go in the museum your first day to deserve them and reserve and an English speaking guide.). I have taken the guided tour twice and taken family there a couple times and these highlights are not to be missed: Bernini's David and Apollo and Daphne, and Persephone sculptures are fluid and show motion and are so lifelike. The details to look for are fingerprints digging into the lifelike flesh, toes hanging off the pedestal base and fingers turning into leaves. Upstairs find Carravaggios and Corregio and pay special attention to Sacred and Profane Love....modesty and marriage vs. an immoral life. It's breathtaking. It takes a minimum of an hour but spend two with a guide or on your own pausing to look up at the frescoes on the ceilings. After you leave stroll through the Borghese park and have snacks and sandwhices at the Bibite trucks, row in a boat on the lake and sit and admire the roof tops and belltowers and domes. This museum and park will be your favorite memory of Rome."

The Bernini\u00b4s David is, by far, the best David in my opinion.

Most paintings are not covered by glass which allows visitors to take clear photos and the sculptures are exquisitely placed throughout the museum. Nice little coffee shop and gift shop too. The museum limits the number of visitors and limits the time you can spend inside the museum to 2 hours... depending on if they are busy. Try to pace yourself so you don't miss anything! You must make advanced reservations online at gebart.it or call +39 06 32810 . If possible, don't carry bags with you, because you'll have to check them before entering the museum. Ticket prices are 11 Euro, visitors with disabilities and their caregiver can enter for free. If you're planning a trip to Rome and happen to be there during the 1st Sunday of the month, the museum is free BUT you must make reservations well in advance.

            "review": "One of the best galleries we ever visited. We have been to Rome many times, but this was the first visit to the Borghese Gallery and were absolutely not disappointed. The building itself with its frescoes and mosaics is already worth the visit, not to mention the statues with real life details, paintings (including several Caravaggios) and many other amazing works of art. A limited amount of visitors are allowed in every two hours and allowed to stay for two hours and ushered out at the end of the visit. Two hours can be enough to get a good idea of the exhibitions of the gallery, but for someone more interested in art will find the two hours a little short. We did have to rush through the paintings gallery on the upper floor and an extra hour would have been adequate. Well, I guess we will have to return and will not mind doing so. We were however somewhat lucky that for the visit we chose the group entering the gallery was not so big. The queue entering after us was long and I guess there must have been quite a crowd in the first rooms. Do purchase the tickets in advance not to be disappointed. You might be lucky going there and be able to purchase a ticket, but I would not bet on it. The Borghese Gallery is very popular. It is easy to purchase the ticket online and then pick up at the ticket office just before the visit."

You have to make a reservation beforehand calling them but it's worth saving 12 or something euro. The gallery is not too big and so doesn't wear you out so much and allows you to enjoy the collection. The visit is limited to 2 hours, which is roughly enough to see everything there, stopping ocassionaly to learn more about certain works. I loved Il Ratto de Proserpina sculpture, the way every detail is shown is just incredible. It's my personal favourite of the whole collection. You can find it in the first hall upstairs, if I'm not mistaken. I'd totally recommend this place, well worth visiting."

Since museum access is crowd limit controlled, your ticket is good only for a specific entry time. Unlike most major world museums, cameras are allowed inside. Magnificent works of art acquired over the years by Cardinal Borghese and housed in his former palatial estate.Galleria is in a massive public park (including zoo, flower gardens, numerous walking trails, etc.) with panoramic vistas of Rome.

Raphael's Deposition is awe inspiring.Most web sites say that photography is not allowed. This is no longer the case, as of last July.

I loved that they only sold a certain number of tickets per reservation time and gave you two hours to leisurely view the treasures. It was the best museum experience we had while in Italy because once we were inside we were not crowded by a million other people. It was so relaxing to stroll around, spend as much time as you wanted in front of the art or the statues and really enjoy them. Make sure you purchase your tickets well in advance because the reservations routinely sell out and a reservation may not be available for days."

You will have to make reservations to enter, but this means you do not have to contend with the swells of people that you do at, say, the Vatican Museum. As you only have two hours to see everything, plan ahead and budget your time. My girlfriend and I started on the second floor and worked our ways backwards to avoid the crowd. This worked out quite well because we are then able to enjoy the highlights of the museum (such as Bernini's Apollo and Daphne) all by ourselves. I would also highly recommend the audio guide, which provides not only helpful input to better appreciate the works but also gives historical details surrounding the creation and acquisition of the museum most notable pieces. If you are in Rome, this is more than worth a visit."

Although the layout and time limit really bugged me, I settled on a 4* because it's not the fault of the works inside that the gallery is somewhat of a jumbled mess in parts. For example, you'll see five artworks on the wall. Below them, you'll see five cards stating what each work is. Unless you have a greatly in-depth knowledge of art (and I do, or at least thought I did before I got here) you'll have no clue which is which. From everything I've been told, the audio guide is extremely helpful. Would've loved to have known that before we attended, but what can you do. There are some works in the Gallery, many, actually, that you don't need an audioguide for. You know Caravaggio's \"Boy with a Basket of Fruit,\" \"David with the Head of Goliath,\" and \"St. Jerome\" when you see them. You can pick out a Bernini on sight. The works in this small but intimate gallery are all beautiful, masterpieces, and absolutely gems of their era. The grounds surrounding the gallery are also beautiful and are worth a walk around beforehand.Book in advance or you won't get inside!"

The building itself is unbelievably sumptuous and I would have gone to have seen it on that basis alone. The art just adds another layer of beauty onto an already incredible experience. One added benefit is that it is on the edge of a really lovely park -- so I'd leave some time in your schedule to walk through it and enjoy a little nature downtime after the hyper visual stimulation of the museum.

The rooms had beautifully painted ceilings. We started at the top floor and worked our way to the lower sculpture floor that had the more interesting exhibits.Photos are allowed, no flash. But some sneaky people do try their luck when the room is emptier and the museum staff is not there ... The Cravaggios and Berninis are fabulous. There were having an additional exhibition called Black Mirror, and featured a fantastic zoetrope; every 8 minutes the room lights are turned off, and the zoetrope spins to create an animated scene of an attack - violent scene involving throwing babies over and fighting. Fascinating piece of heart. Caught it twice.I come from Singapore, and we get charged a lot for \"art\", so the entrance fee was fair, although that having said, we all wished things were cheaper. The euro just dropped further so, there, ok! No bags allowed - free deposit service."

This small art gallery covered two floors of the Borghese Villa in a park that included a considerable amount of outside statuary, including Byron's tomb. The art covered multiple centuries, and literally included the floor and ceiling. Every room had a theme; the top floor was focused on Christian pieces, the bottom floor went as far back as ancient Greece up to Victorian times, including a very intricate, mechanical diorama carousal. The accessible entrance was at the back, close to the small elevator to the second floor. It was a little challenging to get to due to the gravel driveway and a low step into the building. The elevator would not fit my large wheelchair with my leg extenders, but my husband was able to use it with his cane."

They don't have information at each piece but rather a laminated card in each room. I suggest you read the card as it gives you the information you'll need to fully appreciate each gallery.

However, every visitor interested in art should find the time to go for at least one hour quick visit at the Galleria Borghese. Not only the beautiful sculpture of Paolina Borghese made by Canova, but also the nice pictures exhibited there. Also the way the Gallery is organized is worthwhile for a visit. The only problem is that, although are now many years that the Gallery is open again to the public (at least 20 years) the access is limited to a certain number of visitors inside. Therefore, it is advisable to book the ticket in advance on line, to be sure to have the possibility to enter the Gallery when you are in Rome."

When I was a senior in high school (back in 2000-2001) I took a year long Humanities course, which was a mix of an English, art history and history of western civilization course. Through that course, I became kind of obsessed with Bernini, and ever since then, have vowed to see his statues in person. When I started planning our trip to Rome, imagine my joy to find that many of my favorites are housed in this gallery.Getting tickets can be a little bit tricky. They limit the number of people at a time (makes for a much more peaceful experience than the Vatican museums) and so they must be booked weeks in advance. However, the only way to do this online is if you are purchasing a ticket, and we had already planned on using the Roma Pass. They do allow you to call and reserve the ticket, but thankfully the people we were renting our apartment from made this arrangement for us.It is also a little tricky to find, as it isn't directly on any Metro line, and you'll want to give yourself some time so that you arrive early. The Rick Steves guide had good directions from the Spagna stop that involved going through a bit of an underground maze and then walking through the parks in the Villa Borghese complex - it was 10-15 minutes of walking.IT WAS COMPLETELY WORTH IT. There are many amazing things here but to be honest, I only had eyes for Bernini and I spent most of my time (that I wasn't calming my child) gazing raptly at the Rape of Perspehone, Apollo and Daphne, David, Truth Unveiled by Time or Aeneas, Anchises and Ascanius. He is able to make marble seem soft, supple and weightless.The upper level had paintings as well as some other smaller sculptures and busts (including some Bernini did of his patron, and a Bernini sculpture that didn't seem as high quality as the others - I later found out he did when he was 11). There were also some Bernini self portraits.I also enjoyed seeing the Titian and Carravagio they had there. The gallery itself is also sumptuous and beautiful - a fitting surrounding for these works of art.After our trip, we got a little something to eat at the caf\u00e9 in the basement, and enjoyed a more leisurely walk back amongst the greenery of the villa (a refreshing break from the city) and there was a nice playground there for my two kids to burn off some energy."

From his facial expressions of David in the act of giving the last blow to Goliath, to the pressure of the hands in which the god is taking Proserpina away from her home is simply breathtaking. This is a must see for any one who loves and appreciates art. So so so worth it."

The Villa Borghese is a large, pretty park on the northern edge of downtown Rome (up the hill from Spanish Steps and Via Veneto). It's nice to walk through, check out the fountains and then visit the Gallery. But you MUST have a reservation or pre-bought tickets\u2026I watched many people get turned away at the door! (keep in mind this was a private home, so while enormous, never meant to be a public museum)! Some of the world's masterpieces are here - Caravaggios, Titians, etc. But the best are the Bernini sculptures! Just beautiful\u2026I noticed some people had hired a private tour guide, but you really don't need one. Maybe bring a list or book of what you want to see. But it's worth just going to see the actual building - unreal! Great cafe and gift shop on the way out!"

Outstanding collection of art (many recognizable pieces) housed in a spectacular villa.The art is almost overshadowed by the exquisite architectural details, paint finishes and ceiling murals. Even the marble floor patterns are outstanding. Each room is designed to stand on its own with its particular style and detail.We did order tickets in advance, but in late November many were able to purchase tickets on the same day.The steps to the top floor seem relentlessly long and not recommended for anyone infirm. And you do have to check bags--but, oddly, not coats.The Borghese grounds house other museums and the zoological gardens so one can spend an entire day here."

This really cuts down on the crowds and vastly improves the experience compared to most of the high-traffic museums in Italy. You are allowed a peaceful opportunity to learn about and have up close views of this massive collection, particularly Bernini sculptures. My average review is only due to the archaic upstairs-downstairs handling of ticket entry/security/lockers and the clerk who crabbed at us for not having a printed version of our tickets. We were traveling in early June before the crowds and had been able to book as we go on-line, bringing the confirmation number and details on our phone. We had done the same at the Vatican Gallery, but apparently not allowed at the Borghese. Instead we received a lecture on where to find a computer printer since there wasn't one in the apartment we had rented. Oh well. At least it didn't spoil the entry or visit."

We saw this first hand when the people in front of us got huffy with the staffer as he was told that they could not get in that day as they were sold out. But it allows you a 2 hour window to see everything with elbow room, which even in the \"off season\" is a welcome change. Be warned - there are about 80 steps to go to the upper floor. The do have an elevator, but it seems to be for the disabled only, which I get. But, be warned - it will make you huff and puff!! But they have a nice collection - the sculptures were my favorite!"

The original sculptures and paintings in the Borghese Gallery date back to Cardinal Scipione's collection, the son of Ortensia Borghese - Paolo V's sister - and of Francesco Caffarelli, though subsequent events over the next three centuries entailing both losses and acquisition have left their mark. Cardinal Scipion was drawn to any works of ancient, Renaissance and contemporary art which might re-evoke a new golden age. He was not particularly interested in medieval art, but passionately sought to acquire antique sculpture. But Cardinal Scipione was so ambitious that he promoted the creation of new sculptures and especially marble groups to rival antique works. Also the Park around is great to walk around."

The building itself is a magnificent nineteenth-century villa containing 20 rooms on two floors. In much of the main area, there are classical antiquities and incredible sculptures, including many by Gian Lorenzo Bernini as well as Canova's life-size, semi-nude portrayal of Pauline Bonaparte as 'Venus Victrix'. But there is much more than sculptures. The breath-taking collection of paintings includes masterpieces by Caravaggio ('St. John the Baptist', 'Madonna, Child and Serpent' and 'Boy with a Basket of Flowers'), Raphael ( the beautiful 'Lady with a Unicorn' and 'The Deposition') and 'The Scouring of Christ' by Titian.Still set as it was created in a vast and most pleasant park, the Borghese Gallery is Rome's must-see collection of art treasures."

            "review": "Unbelievable - A Must See. Prior to our 17 day Italy trip, including six days in Rome, I purchased online tickets for my wife and I to attend the Borghese Gallery. It worked out well. I was asked to bring an email they send me that confirmed our reservation. I believe I paid an extra euro or two per ticket.We walked to the Gallery from our hotel that was near Termini Station. It was a pleasant 20 minute walk. Our route took us through a good portion of the park. It was a pleasant and quiet walk. When you arrive at the gallery, you'll need to go downstairs through the small door at the center of the staircase. There we traded in our confirmation email printout for tickets. We were told to return near to the hour to await entry. One suggestion: since you cannot take bags or backpacks into the Gallery, you must have them stored in this same area. Women can keep their purses or smaller bags. It's quick but I suggest you do it immediately after getting your tickets. We came back just before entry time to deposit my backpack and there was a long line waiting to those type things in. However, as you exit, they are very quick to get your belongings back to you. In this same downstairs area are bathrooms, a large bookstore, and an area for snacks and drinks.You are allowed to take your cameras in to take photos. There initially was some confusion about that. We also rented the audioguides. Get those. This Gallery has so much wonderful art and there are back stories to much of them. The audioguides provided that info. We noticed couples and small groups who hired guides. If we were to return, we'd do the same. We overheard one of these guides talking and her narrative was informative as well as very interesting.There is so much to see in one visit and you are limited to 2 hours in the Gallery. At our own pace and listening to a little bit more than half of the audioguide presentations we easily used up the two hours.Since the Gallery houses almost all of the best of Bernini, I suggest you take time to fully appreciate Apollo and Daphne, the Rape of Proserpina, and David. I took lots of photos from all angles to remember these works.This is an unbelievable collection of art. It is amazing that so much is housed in this one building. Our visit here was one of the many high-lights of our trip.After our visit, we walked through the park and arrived at Piazza del Popolo."

Show up half an hour before your time and enjoy a walk around the park area and a gelato. Inside, the gallery is incredible, definitely one of my top three sights in Rome.

The museum gives you 2 full hours so you can take your time and circle back and perhaps catch a moment alone to gasp in wonder at the most beautiful marble Bernini statues you will ever see in the world! It is truly a one of a kind experience and one you will never forget. Every room is a jewel box of exquisite art from the marble floors to walls to ceilings never mind the art work in the room. Set in the beautiful Borghese Gardens, you can stroll under trees, perhaps sit on a bench and listen to an old man play classical music on an accordian and relish in what you have just experienced. Security is tight so only bring what you need and you'll have to check your bags but they do allow photos (no flash). We go back every time we are in Rome and are always amazed!"

I can't say enough about this amazing art housed in a beautiful building and grounds. You MUST book ahead online. Print it out and take it with you. You are allowed 2 hours in the gallery. Arrive a minimum of 1/2 hour (off season) before your scheduled time. Go in through the ground floor archway at the center of the building. The ticket desk is immediately to your right. Stand on line and trade your computer printout for a paper ticket. There is bag check room desk to your left with another line. Ahead and in between the two is a desk (also with a line) to get your audiophone. Some people then went to the rear of this floor to stand on line to get into the picture gallery - don't do it. What I did and I think it preferable is to go back outside and walk up the lovely outside staircase into the first floor and start your audio tour there. There are less people entering at the same lime and you walk into pure beauty. It is amazing! THe first floor has wonderful works - frescoes, sculptures,etc. My favorite was Apollo and Daphne in white gleeming marble. Bernini of course. In room number IV at the right side corner is a spiral stair case that will take you up to the Picture Gallery. In between on the left side of the staircase is a toilette (WC) if you need one. The second floor Picture Gallery has so many paintings it is overwheming. My favorite there was Caravaggio's painting of David holding the head of Goliath (actually the head of Caravaggio himself). Two hours ( all you are allowed) is certainly not enough time for this place and it is worth a future repeat visit. Bernini and Caravaggio art works shine in this beautiful setting."

The rooms themselves are splendid, but the paintings and sculptures - most notably those by Caravaggio and Bernini - are just beautiful.It's not such a huge gallery, so it's great that a limited number of people are alloted to each 2-hour session to avoid overcrowding.Would recommend pre-purchasing tickets online (both to arrive on time for each timeslot, as well as to avoid missing out as we noticed some sessions for a later date were booked out early). I would also highly recommend renting the audioguide as there are no translations or descriptions of the artworks in the rooms, and the audioguide (much better than most galleries IMO) provides very good contexts and explanations for the various rooms as well as artworks. However, the guidebook which I also purchased in the bookshop prior to entering the gallery (there are two guidebooks for Galerie Borghese and the one I purchased was the comprehensive one at \u20ac25) was not very useful at all as it primarily focused on acquisition / transfer / restoration of the artworks."

Seriously! the art on display here is to die for! The scultures of Bernini will rival anything the Vatican or Florence city can throw at you. We took a museum guide rather than use the audio-guide as there was not much of a price difference. The guide was a very knowledgeable art historian who gave us a good insight into some of the works on display. The best part is that unlike the Vatican, you can explore the rest of the museum once the tour was over.DO NOT MISS"

Almost everything here is A list, which is not the case with most of the other museums in Rome. Set in a beautiful park, even getting here is pleasant. The strict two hour visit is barely enough time to devour the best works, but you are left wanting more. And isn't that the way a visit should be? Best bet is to book your tickets on line so that you won't be kept waiting. The Bernini statues here are among his best. Just incredible stuff. If you go to only one art museum in Rome, this is the one to vsiti."

But went along because I thought it was the thing to do.We were lucky in that I had not booked, but rolled up in the November afternoon and was able to join the next admission.Best thing about my visit, bearing in mind I perfer modern art, was the view of the gardens and the cafe below. Of course there were one or two pieces worthwhile, but I could have easily skipped this galleria and not felt I missed anything.BTW the cafe downstairs is fabulous for afternoon tea and very affordable. The fruit granite was worth the visit just in itself."

(It rivals the Frick in NYC, and Vatican, but lacks the sheer scale of the Metropolitan Museum, d'Orsay, or Louvre). The first floor is filled with sculptures by Bernini that are truly \"awe\" some. One wonders how he was trumped by Michelangelo. The second floor is filled with Italian paintings. The entire museum is an amazing \"home\" filled with treasures and priceless works. The frescoes on the ceilings alone were a sight to behold in each room. Truly not to be missed by anyone visiting Rome that has an appreciation for art. You get a 2 hour pass with a set entry time, so plan ahead. I'd recommend getting an art historian guide to accompany you. There were several there guiding others...

This was our favorite\u2026even my husband (who has zero interest in art) agree that it topped even the Vatican museums and the Coliseum/Roman Forum (we don\u2019t like crowds have no any special affinity with these sites so that may have something to do with it). We went in early October and it was sunny with sudden downpours. If you\u2019re in the property and are thirsty, you can grab bottled water at the gift shop/canteen or have a drink from one of the water fountains in front of the Gallery (we were skeptical to try this at first, but it was great tasting and refreshing!) We met our guide outside and were ushered in to deposit our things in a locker. We were given 1 small clear plastic bag per person and we were allowed to bring in anything we could fit in that bag- including wallets, passports, phones and cameras.We had the most enthusiastic and charming guide (Viator/City Wonders- ask for the wonderful storyteller/art expert/overall angel of a guide Rebecca) that gave us a great narration on the exquisite art pieces including the jaw-dropping Bernini sculptures which IMHO is scores more intricate and dynamic than those seen in the Vatican museums and even the Uffizi Gallery. Bernini\u2019s marble sculptures capture pivotal moments in Greek mythology- they seem to come alive vs. stationary statues like the popular David. The gallery is like a high-end restaurant; it doesn\u2019t drown you with art and instead showcases choice pieces of really great looking and interesting art (no renaissance pieces either) and gives you enough time and space to actually appreciate what you\u2019re seeing.It rained the afternoon we were at the Gallery so we weren\u2019t able to tour the gardens, which is a shame because it looked gorgeous in photos. Instead, our tour guide walked with us all the way to the nearest subway station and saw us off to our next destination (can\u2019t say enough nice things about Rebecca, she would offer help to anyone who looked lost!)If you\u2019re a walker and are wearing comfortable shoes, you can walk all the way to the Pincio Terrace overlooking the Piazza del Popolo so you can end with a gorgeous photo of the sun set over the piazza.Try to schedule this at the end of your trip so it doesn't spoil the other museums/sites for you :)"

The rooms/galleries were lush and over the top.We loved the busts of the Roman emperors; seeing them in one room brought faces to these historic names we have read about. Towards the end of the tour, the Bernini sculpture of the woman turning into a tree was amazing!If you have time to roam the gardens, do it! Carousels, local spontaneous musicians, seg-ways, bicycles, ponds and fountains--it's a lovely place to spend the day. Paths, trees, shade, gardens, vendors, musicians--what's not to like!"

The Borghese Gallery sits to the north of the main city centre and is surrounded by parklands and gardens - a stunning setting for the large, white gallery building itself.As the gallery only admits 360 people per two hour timeslot, you need to book your tickets online and then arrive at the gallery at least 30 minutes in advnace of your timeslot to collect the tickets. Make sure you also join the cloakroom queue, as ALL bags, umbrellas etc must be checked. This includes womens' handbags unless they are small purse size. (Don't try and bypass the cloakroom as you will be stopped before entering and asked to check your bag.)You then join the queue to enter the gallery at your allotted time. Note that you have two hours, and at the end of your timeslot must leave to admit the next group.The gallery was stiflingly hot and humid on a 19 degree day, which made queuing downstairs unbearable, and unfortunately it was just as bad on the 1st floor where the bulk of the paintings are showcased. Fortunately the lower floor with the sculptures was much more comfortable.We enjoyed the art, including Caravaggio and Rubens amongst others, and the rooms were an artwork in themselves with lovely frescoes and paintings.So in a nutshll, the gallery is highly recommended, but prepare yourself for a stuffy environment inside and dress in layers accordingly. (Note that the cloakroom won't take jackets so you'll have to carry them.)Other points of note:- The website says all cameras must be checked in the cloakroom, but this was not the case. Cameras without flash were fine, but definitely no bags or purses, or water.- At 9 Euros for a fridge magnet (admission is 11 Euros), don't bother with the souvenir shop.- Reserve/pay for your tickets online in advance. No walk ins allowed on the day we were there, and 7 November is hardly peak season."

This time, I booked well in advance. It turned out to be the highlight of our time in Rome. The art collection is very good, and would be worth seeing on its own. But, seeing it in the mansion, with rooms and outdoor views which seem designed to enhance the art, is an amazing experience. In a way that wasn't true in any other museum we visited in Europe on this trip, in the Borghese we felt almost as we had stepped into a different, calmer and more beautiful, time and place. If you go to the Borghese Gallery, try to arrange your time so that you can walk back to central Rome through the vast Borghese Gardens. It takes less time than you might guess to walk to the Spanish steps from there. For most of the way, you'll be walking through a leafy park. Then, near the end, you'll be on a promenade overlooking all of Rome. You'll pass a nice Gelateria, which is worth a stop. A bit past that, you'll find yourself at the top of the Spanish Steps. All-in-all, a trip to the Borghese Gallery and Gardens is a wonderful way to spend your time in Rome"

In addition, the rooms are beautiful and full of interesting details - moldings, ceilings, floors. If you visit, I suggest finding a printed or online guide beforehand and deciding what you want to see. Then, depending on how long your list is, book more than one two-hour slot.

Our tickets where for 9am - we arrived a bit before 8:30 and took pictures outside as they weren't open yet. at 8:30'ish they open the doors and you enter and go thru the process - very organized. FYI: no bags/purses allowed so they make you ck them in a locker - they have staff take your bags and place them in lockers and give you the key. They won't let you into the exhibits till 9am but you can visit the cafe and gift shops. We saw a line forming at 8:45 so we joined in and right at 9am we were allowed through the roped off areas. They direct everyone up to the top level - so you either walk up a couple of flights of stairs or take elevator. At first I thought you couldn't take photos, but then realized you could :-)The art on display is truly amazing. The crowds when we went weren't large. We went on a Sunday so no school groups.The tix give you a 2 hour window to enjoy the gallery - it was plenty of time.

There were three sites I definitely wanted to see: Vatican, Colosseum, and Borghese Gallery. I decided the best way to do this would be with a private guide. I found a company online called \"Private Tour of Rome.\" The company offered private tours for all three sites so I booked with them. I cannot tell you how pleased I was. Everything was handled via email. I was contacted immediately and guided through the process. I purchased my own tickets to the Vatican and Colosseum online (was sent the link to the website) and then forwarded the vouchers to Private Tour of Rome. That was the only thing I paid for in advance. Payment for the tour itself was not required until the end of the tour (although payment was requested in cash). The price for the private guide was very reasonable, and I could not have asked for a better guide. Elisa was a young Italian woman, very professional, very educated, very enthusiastic, spoke perfect English, and provided me with lots of information. We spent one whole day together, including a delightful lunch at a restaurant she selected (she introduced me to some typical Roman fried appetizers). The tour of the Borghese Gallery was delightful and it is now my favorite museum in the world. The Bernini sculptures were simply dazzling. I highly recommend this company if you are seeking a private guide in Rome. I liked everything about the way the tours were arranged and handled. A+++"

            "review": "Must do your homework to avoid frustration at this superlative museum. This is a relatively small museum which house some of the finest works of art in the western world. Therefore the demand to visit this museum is very high. The Gallery's solution to this demand is to sell timed tickets for a specific two hour period (actually they start ushering you out 10 minutes before the end of the 2 hours) allowing only 360 people to enter the museum at any one time. Tickets need to be pre-booked in advance, perferably online or by telephone, as the time slots are usually booked out a week in advance. Do not expect to be able to walk up to the gallery and get tickets for the next session or for one of the time slots that day. That would be a receipe for disappointment and frustration. A few reviewers on tripadvisor obviously did not do their homework, were not aware of the booking system and made their way to the gallery only to be disappointed. A few people have claimed on tripadvisor they have been able to get walk up tickets but this is EXTREMELY rare and is a tactic which will usually end in tears if tried.I have wanted to visit Galleria Borghese for the Bernini statue of Apollo and Daphne alone ever since Kenneth Clark introduced me to the work in his wonderful TV series \"Civilisation\". I had been put off attending the gallery on previous visits to Rome thinking it was too far away, not wanting to be tied down to a specific time, and being worried I would not be able to book by telephone as a non Italian speaker. I was almost put off on this last visit by the sprinkling of bad reviews on tripadvisor about the ticketing rigmarole and, the queueing, the restrictions, and the brusque staff. These are not unwarranted criticisms but if you do your homework it is well worth the trouble to be able to view the sublime works on show.In these days of free wifi and iPads it is now easier to book online but it is still advisable to have access to a printer (I used the one in our hotel) to have a copy of your booking as a back up to face the famously unhelpful gallery staff. I booked a convenient session a week ahead (also note the gallery is closed on Mondays) and allocated a whole morning for the visit. Sessions are for two hours starting from 9AM and we chose the 11AM session to allow time to get to the gallery, being mindful of the gallery's warning to arrive one hour before the session, and also being forewarned that there will be queues to a) collect your pre-booked tickets, then b) put in the cloakroom everything and anything you may be carrying (no coats, bags -even purses, handbags or gift bags- cameras etc are allowed in), then c) queue to obtain an audio guide, and finally d) queue at the main entrance to access the gallery when your time arrives.The online booking system was a little involved but not too difficult, although you do have to log on and create an account for the TicketOne system to book and then provide an email address, home address etc (a little involved for purchasing a 11 Euro - AUS $ 15.85 per person ticket). I only used TicketOne once for booking the Galleria Borghese and have never needed this system again but I still get advertising emails from them one year later. There is also a 1,50 Euro booking fee per person so the total cost for two people was 25 Euros. The booking code provided is needed to pick up your actual tickets on the day, so make sure you print off a copy of your booking as proof when you confront the unsmiling ticket staff at the gallery. Some tripadvisor reviewers have already mentioned that this can sometimes be a problem if one does not have a copy of the code.The gallery advised on their website to be there an hour before the session time. We dutifully followed this but it was probably not neccesary to be that far ahead when we visited during November. 30 minutes before might be more reasonable, but this may change in the busy summer period or if one needs to check bags or pick up an audio guide. We rarely use audio guides and were suitably forewarned so did not have any bags, not even a camera or a purse, to avoid the need to use the cloakroom. At least getting there early allows one to explore the extensive park which surrounds the gallery.Some reviewers have commented that the gallery is some distance from the centre of Rome but that is probably a little overstated. It seems this may be because people catch the Metro to the Spagna station and find that they have to walk a fair way thorough the Villa Borgese gardens (which has an uphill gradient) to reach the Galleria at the eastern end of the park. We walked from our hotel on the via Nazionale finding it an easy 20 minute walk (about 1.7 kms) by way of the via Torino to the Piazza di San Bernardo (and not too far away is the church of Santa Maria Vittoria which holds another Bernini masterpiece, The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa) , then further north to reach the via Piedmonte, crossing the Corso d'Italia, the road becoming the via Giacomo Puccini to reach the park on the via Pinciana. It is a short walk along the path in the park, Viale dell' Uccelliera, to the Galleria Borghese.To get an idea of the attitude of the staff of the gallery, think of the purveyor of soup in a well known Seinfeld episode. Of course they deal with thousands of tourists a day, many unprepared and asking the same inane question, but they should make it less obvious that they would rather chew their own legs off than talk to you politely or even, God forbid, give you a smile. They seem to forget they are in the hospitality business. Be prepared for their brusqueness but if you have planned ahead you should be OK. First you must go to the ticket counter in the basement area below the two storey building. We were about 90 minutes ahead of our session time and there was no queue but of course the two people behind the counter failed to acknowledge us or even look up until they were ready to deign to attend to us. I provided my name and booking code (with a copy of my booking handy) and was handed my tickets by the unsmiling attendant. Forewarned, we did not need to check bags or get the audio guide. There were no queues at this time but we did notice later that people who arrived only 15 minutes before the session had to negotiate lines for each of these requirements.Before our session we did see a little of the park (although it was quite a cold and overcast day so we did not linger long outside). We did sit inside to watch the antics of the cafe. As we already had our tickets we could avail ourselves of the toilets (the ticket being scrupuously scanned by the attendant with greater vigilence than a US Immigrations Officer - fortunately we did not have to suppy our finger prints!) and noted museum patrons, who had pre-paid the gallery entrance but had the temerity to buy something from the cafe and decided to defy Roman officialdom by using the bathrooms before collecting their tickets, were ruthlessly turned away from the needed ablutions. The cafe bar counter was well patronised by other staff of the gallery crowding out any gallery visitors and making it difficult for these actual customers to use this cafe (for whom it was presumably designed). One unfortunate Japanese tourist ordered a coffee from the disdainful cafe staff and sadly knocked it over spilling the contents over the counter, much to the undisguised disgust of the \"friendly\" hospitality worker. The spillage was inexpertly wiped up by this aforemnetioned \"paragon of friendliness\" but some had seeped into a few of the cakes and sandwiches etc in the counter space below. It entertained us seeing how the mess continued to drip for some time, or that some puddles still remained, effecting the items below which were still for sale for the next unsuspecting walking wallet (I mean, gallery visitor) to come along.One leaves the undercroft area where the ticket counter, cafe, cloakroom, toilets etc are to go outside and then up the stairs to enter the gallery when one's session is due. People assemble a little before time so there is a little queue here too. We noted too that those who had not done their research had arrived in the vain hope that the staff would expalin the rules, were unsure as to where to go to find the entrance, or that others had foolishly decided to get a last minute purchase from the cafe or bookshop (or use the toilet) and lined up at the entrance clutching small bags or their gift shop bags only to be triumphantly turned away by the entrance guards when entry was allowed.I don't want anyone to be put off by all this, it is just the entertaining theatre that one encounters in many Roman attractions. Don't be put off, be prepared, hopefully laugh at the stupidity of it all before enjoying the sublime beauty in store for you inside which makes all this nonsense worth it.Despite this being a timed session, with 360 people in the mainly small rooms of this relatively small gallery, it is usually fairly crowded in each room. It might be advisable to try and avoid the initial rush to the Bernini sculptures in Rooms I, II, III and IV. The natural inclination of American and Contentinal tourists is to turn right and make for Room I. Being Australian we were more inclined to keep left, made for Room VIII first, and had the marvellous Caravaggios almost to ourselves. Other more canny visitors make for the Picture Gallery on the First Floor and then return to the Ground Floor to view the Berninis when most of the session group (often dutifully following their audio guides) have moved upstairs. Note too that there is also a toilet halfway up the stairs to the first floor should one require it and so one does not waste time leaving the gallery to go back to the main facilities in the basement.It amazes me that there are the odd reviews on tripadvisor who say that the collection is \"nothing special\" or that they had had enough well before the two hour (actually 110 minutes) session had expired. To paraphase the science historian and broadcaster James Burke, I can only imagine these people as some modern version of a Philistines picking their noses uncomprehendingly in front of a Raphael and wondering what the toilets in the building are for!Room VIII, the Sala of Silenus is positively dripping with some of Caravaggio's most wonderful works including \"Boy with a Basket of Fruit\", \"Saint Jerome\", \"David with the Head of Goliath\" (the head being Caravaggio's own portrait) and \"Saint John the Baptist\"(1610). Room VII and VIII sport some fine Roman sculptures of the second and third centuries AD providing a prelude to the breathtaking sumptiousness of the Sala degli Imperatori. The room itself is spectacular enough, the Borgheses shamelessly flaunting their immense wealth - the marble flooring, the pilasters, the hexagonal cameos, the friezes and the ceiling frescoes. I could have delighted in the many marvellous porphyry busts of Roman Emperors here alone (which excel anything one can see in the Capitoline Museum), yet the centre piece of Room IV is Bernini's \"Rape of Proserpina\" and one is amazed at the delicate detail, rendering in marble the curls of Pluto's beard or that solid stone could portray the softness of human flesh as the God of the Underworld's fingers cause subtle indents in Proserpina's skin. More of Bernini's genius is on show in Room III which holds surely the highlight of this museum, \"Apollo and Daphne\". I spent the most time in this room wondering and at the artistry and beauty of this work from every angle. Words can not describe adequately this triumph of an artist's skill. To say this gallery contains nothing special!? What are you doing in a museum or even in Rome if you could think this! Finally seeing this work was the highlight of my visit to Rome and one of those rare moments when seeing the work \"in the flesh\" is a far greater experience than seeing it in a book or on TV (the Mona Lisa is a scribble in comparison! - I am joking, well just a little).Room II contains Bernini's David which, on some days, I think gives Michelangelo a run for his money. I like the realism and action of the work and Bernini made a face in a mirror to copy for David's visage, so it is a self portrait of sorts. When we visited in November 2013 it was partly obscured by scafolding so one could not get the full 360 experience, but hopefully renovations of this Room have now been completed.Being something of a Bonapartist I was equally excited to see Canova's famous reclining nude of Paolina Bonaparte Borghese. This work is in no way shamed by being in close proximity to the genius of Bernini. Again something not to be missed and demands a leisurely viewing. Although it may be a little crass, I was keen to obtain a souvenir of this work. I found the examples in the Galleria Borghese gift shop expensive and very poor quality. I would recommend visiting the shop of a Florentine seller on the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II called La Fiortentina which has some beautiful souvenirs of Roman artefacts, including a minature of Paolina.Upstairs on the First Floor is the Picture Gallery with some 12 small rooms of paintings from mainly the 16th to the 18th century. One has to tear oneself away from the Berninis to not run out of time to see this floor, but I might not have done them justice as I had to return to the Ground Floor before the session expired for one last look at the Berninis. Highlights of the Picture Gallery would have to be Raphael's \"Portrait of a Lady with a Unicorn\" and the brilliant colours of his \"Deposition\" (both in Room IX). Lorenzo Lotto's \"Portrait of a Man\" in Room XII appealed to me as well as the senuous beauty of many of the figures in Domenichino's \"Diana the Huntress\" (Room XIX). Not forgetting the rich blues in Bellini's \"Madonna with Child\" (1510) in Room XX which shares space with a couple of wonderful works by Titian.We could have easily stayed three hours or more in this wonderful museum but from 10 minutes before the session ends the staff begin to rapidly and methodically closing off rooms to quickly usher visitors out the door to clear the venue for the next session. In conclusion, be prepared, BOOK IN ADVANCE, be bemused by the outrageous staff and revel in the superb masterpieces. A MUST for any visit to Rome."

We were lucky to get tickets on the day - normally they are selling them for about four days ahead. The place has three levels: the underground level has the ticket office, cloakroom, cafe and shop. You have to leave your bags in the cloakroom. The next floor is the main entrance - there was no indication of whether you should go left or right, so we went right. We circled around looking at the magnificent statues and paintings until we arrived back where we had started. We had to ask how to get to the next level and had to go half way around the rooms again to find the place where you go up to the next floor - it wasn't indicated which is a bit odd. The top floor is mainly paintings and not quite as good as the first floor. All of the paintings and sculptures have a description just in Italian, not in English, which is a pity. There was not a single employee of the villa borghese in any of the exhibition rooms, which is a bit strange, so there was no possibility of asking any questions about the exhibits."

I have a new and special appreciation for Bernini now. Be sure to book at least a week in advance. I booked the first 'window' of the day - 0900. It says to get there an hour prior, but this probably is not necessary. You get 2 hours. And, that is really all. They will holler at you until you go, and usher you out. I definitely recommend the first tour of the day - it was very peaceful. I also highly recommend the audio guide. My husband and I each got one for 5 Euro each. It really brings to life what was going on during the acquisition and situation for each work covered. You really do have to push quickly though, the guide is about 1.5 hours worth of talking, and it's mostly about specific pieces. Look quickly at the others. I also recommend strolling through the park if you have time. It really made me feel like saying \"when in Rome\" - as the local seemed to be strolling about too. Wonderful highlight of my 2.5 day trip!!"

It is different to other museums in that only a certain number of people are allowed within a time slot - which is a dream compared to other overcrowded tourist attractions. You must make your booking beforehand, you can pay there on the day. When you enter the gallery you need to leave all cameras, handbags and extra jackets with reception (you get a ticket nr for this) so know this beforehand if you do not like doing this, leave all extras at home. The art is less easy to understand, they do have big pages with a description of the room and it's art which is not always necessarily easy to follow. Every room has a center piece sculpture (amazing) - the rest of the rooms are then filled with either paintings or smaller sculptures. You get 2 hours inside which is enough. My husband is not even into art and he found it captivating. The gallery has nice gardens to stroll through especially after a long day of walking around. There is a lot to take in, but take your time and just view the beauty."

The only negative is that the gallery does not provide a guide in English unless you pay additional for head phones.

Be sure you book in advance as walk ups are most always disappointed and turned away. Your ticket allows you two hours in the museum so manage your time efficiently.

The paintings amount to the pick of all the great renaissance artists, although Caravaggio seemed particularly noticeable perhapsbecause of his distinctive and innovative technique. However there were downsides to the tour. Photography is allowed without flash, but the routeing of visitors is such that people can walk round all sides of some of the best sculptures so it is almost impossible not to get some person in your shot. Then there is the spotlighting deployed which reflects excessively off the surfaces of the paintings, even worse for those works protected by glass. I can't recall another major gallery where these problems were so infuriating and other photographers whom I spoke to readily agreed. Too much to hope that the VB will read this post I suppose?"

I called a month in advance and gave them my name and they told me my reservation time (you have to call and reserve a time before you go). When we went inside, the girl asked for my confirmation number, but I was never given one on the phone?! I eventually talked her into letting us in at our reserved time of 3pm. I then waited in line for a device for the audio tour and they told us to go outside and upstairs to the entrance. It turns out this entrance doesn\u2019t exist, but we stood there with other people for 20 minutes before I went back in and figured this out. Then my girlfriend had to check her purse\u2026the entire purse so be prepared to hand that over. Then when the tour started, the audio device I had stopped working. Now, once we started with the tour, it quickly became apparent that the audio tour and the direction we were told to go didn\u2019t match, so you would be listening to info for one room when in fact you were in another room. Also, it appears that this museum doesn\u2019t like to use air conditioning and it was very hot inside.

We could adequately view the art pieces (unlike the crowds at Uffizi and Accademia in Florence), and the artwork and sculptures in the Gallery were fascinating (our tour guide added to this delight). The Park outside was delightful. Unfortunately, the gardens are unattended and falling into disrepair but all in all the Borghese was the most enjoyable. activity for us in Rome. The view over the city at the end of the Park is comparable to the view from the Piazelle Michelangelo in Florence.

Be aware you cannot take large bags in, you can check them at the entrance, however. You can take pictures so hang on to your camera or phone. While you can book in advance (visits are limited to 2 hours), we've done it, paying full price for tickets, only to find both our visits could have been made for a Euro...coincidence, perhaps, but next time, we're not booking in advance and will take our chances on getting in."

If you know the collection and there is something you definitely want to see here, then of course it is worth a visit.If you are generally interested in art, but not knowledgable, then bear in mind the effort it takes to go here.You will have to book in advance - we went on 1st October, it was sold out to 7th - booking in advance is ok on internet, but involved booking fees. You have to select your two hour slot on booking. This means you have to work your day around the visit. We found ourselves wanting to go somewhere else and not doing this because we had our slot booked, so recommend either early in the morning or late in day to give more flexibilityYou have to get there! - it is off the beaten track and on top of a hill. Nice walk through the park, but be prepared for the slope, especially on a warm day.... alternatively use the 116 route electric bus.You have to go through the ticket collection and bag check in process. We arrived a bit late so the queue was not too bad.After all this, the collection seemed good, but not \"wow\". And not better than that elsewhere."

Pay for the guided tour with headphones - its worth it. Pay to skip the lines too - also worth it. Our guide not only brought the art to life with her passion and descriptions, she also gave us personal insight into the artists, with specific and personal insight into Bernini. We were traveling with a small group and everyone agreed it was the best tour in Rome! Everyone left with a greater appreciation for Borghese, Bernini and the role the Pope played in Rome and art history.You must arrive early. The walk to the gallery from the front entrance is quite distance, although the walk through the grounds is very impressive.Don't forget your camera or video (no flash allowed). Many great photo ops! A good quality camera with low light capabilities is a must. This was an amazing and memorable experience and definitely a \"must see\" on a trip to Rome."

Hard to say something new about this deservedly famous villa/gallery, but preparatory reading online & in guidebooks in no way lessens the awe of being in the presence of such a high density of amazing masterpieces. The lovely grounds (filled with families on a Sunday), building, mosaics & paintings (several of which mirror the subjects of the sculptures) are all quite worthwhile, but are overshadowed by the sculptures, which repay careful study from all sides. Do allow ample time to get to the gallery from the park borders, & to pick up tickets, check bags & queue up for the timed entries. Afterwards, a pleasant 12-15 minute stroll to the south takes you to some excellent restaurants on Via Flavia (la Locanda, la Pentolaccia, il Pinsere)."

Everyone knows the art is fantastic at the Borghese Gallery, so I will just talk about logistics.You absolutely do have to book your tickets in advance for the Borghese Gallery. We got there very close to the admission time for our tickets and it ate into our time a wee bit because I wanted to get the audio guide. I felt the audio guide was really worthwhile. Very informative about the artists as well as the pieces of art. If there are two of you, have one person stand in the queue to go into the museum and the other person go to pick up the audio guide(s). Also, I'm pretty sure that the Borghese does not allow large backpacks and camera cases, so leave these items at the hotel, or you'll also have to go to a line to check them.The museum is set up with sculpture on the first floor and paintings on the second floor. I'm more of a sculpture person and dawdled too much on the first floor. I had made it through maybe 30% of the second floor when they announced it was time for my time slot of guests to vacate the premises. And they do NOT give you much time to high tail it out of there!If I were to do it again, I would trot right up to the second floor and work my way backwards, going into the most empty rooms, paying attention to the time. Most people work their way through the museum in the order that the rooms appear on the maps. But the audio guides are the kind with numbers for each piece, so you can view/listen in any order you want. Starting on the second floor and working down, I think the crowds would be less in each room. A lot of people don't spend the entire two hours in the museum. By the end of my slot, I'm guessing about 65% of the people had already left. So, rather than starting off in rooms so crowded that you can hardly see anything, you'd have a good view of all the art this way."

Tickets sell out quickly, so reserving in advance by internet is recommended. Be prepared to check all bags, including small handbags, as they're not permitted in the galleries. The artwork is simply astounding, as is the architecture of the villa itself. The lower galleries are dedicated to classical art, while the upper galleries display art of the 15th through 18th centuries. There is a small cafe on the premises for the famished, as the museum is inside a large park, and the immediate surrounding neighborhood has few places to eat. A 10-minute walk takes you to the Via Veneto and a wealth of restaurants."

Granted, you're guaranteed to get in with your ticket but there's such a difference in politeness and manners amongst Americans (get in line, don't cut) and Europeans (specifically the older French & Dutch ladies at our visit! Even a French man behind me was annoyed with their pushiness & line cutting). But once inside you're free to roam about. I suggest having a guidebook in order to know what you want to see, especially if you're with children and know your time is limited. The volunteers/staff were helpful & kind despite the language barrier (they didn't speak English; I didn't speak Italian) in explaining how one work we wanted to see was on loan to Boston. We only spent an hour here max...that was enough to catch all the major works we wanted to see. Afterwards we spent another hour exploring the park. It is a sight to see in and of itself! We rented a surrey bike for 4 and the kids had a ball riding all over, stopping to take pictures. Afterwards, there were pony rides, an amusement ride and a playground to let the kids have fun. Plus many balloon & food vendors. There's a nice cafe by this play area that we bought paninis & drinks from and then ate on a park bench.

This 17th century villa was built to house the art collection of Cardinal Scipione Borghese(1579-1633) who became Pope in 1605. Make sure to reserve tickets several days in advance. Your ticket allows you only two hours in the museum so arrive on time because the museum is completely emptied before the next timed visit is begun. An audio tour will enhance your appreciation of the villa and it's remarkable collection. On the ground floor are amazing sculptures by Canova and Bernini and six masterpieces painted by Caravaggio set among the lavish rooms with highly decorated floors and ceilings. We spent too much time on this floor and had to rush through the next floor dedicated to the painting collecting. Masterpieces by Rafael, Bellini, Titian and Veronese round out this unique collection. The gardens surrounding the villa invite you to tarry."

To actually see with my own eyes the sculptures of Bernini and the art of Caravaggio was an extremely emotional experience, I wept throughout the tour as the professor )who spoke perfect english explained in detail how the works were created and the stories that went with them. The cafe is not particularly expensive and there are plenty of toilets. It is accessible for those with mobility problems and - or wheelchairs if you book in advance and explain your needs. All staff were very helpful, patient and informative even on a sunday in August ... When in Rome this is an essential attraction, possibly even more so than my beloved Colleseum.

The residence and the collection were everything we expected and more. First, I appreciated seeing the art displayed in the home of the owner. Second, the detailed painting on the ceilings were an unexpected surprise and showcased the 3-D effects of the day.

My favorite were numerous Bernini sculptures placed throughout the different rooms.Reservations are based on 2 hour visit times at the gallery. You receive your tickets at the basement and the entrance is the main doors on the first level. I was suggested to avoid the mass of people crowding around the first floor once you enter by going upstairs to the second level. Everybody starts on the first level to admire the sculptures and then eventually make their way up to the second level for the paintings. If you do the opposite, the place won't be empty, but you'll get a smaller number of people enjoying the gallery in the same room as you. during the second hour of the appointed time, the first level was fairly empty. We were able to admire the sculptures in peace, not having to wait for all the other tourists to take their turns snapping photos. The Borghese Gallery is a must see when visiting Rome. I am glad I took the advice given to me and started my way up, and then down to the first floor. It gave us plenty of time to admire these masterpieces without feeling rushed."

They only allow a certain number of people in the gallery for 2 hours at a time, so you can really get a good look at the collection. I was amazed at the sculptures and art work from artists like Bernini, Caravaggio and Canova, including the Bernini David, and Apollo and Daphne. It is the most manificent collection I've seen outside the Vatican and Louvre. Head upstairs to the portraits first to avoid the bulk of the crowd, and then after you've been through that floor (you have 30 minutes), then head down and most of the crowd will have moved through. We got the audio tour and it was nicely done, one of the better ones, and very informative. They were a bit disorganised when we first arrived with no directions about where to pick up the tickets, but we soon sorted it out. Highly recommend!

Your guide should be able to give you an understanding of the immense power and wealth of the Borghese Family and if you are visiting without a guide, read everything you can get your hands on about what you are seeing. We walked the Gardens after touring the Gallery and it is an expansive piece of real estate in Rome. There aren't the same large crowds as The Spanish Steps or The Vatican, so it's a nice break from the traditional tourist attractions of Rome. It is also not a Church nor is affiliated with the Church so the art you are seeing lacks religious restriction. It's amazingly beautiful and inspirational.

She said we would be fine. we stood in line for twenty minutes to enter and at the entrance the guide turned us around and told us we must check our bags. So then the two hours we were allotted to spend in the museum was used up to stand in lines. Furthermore, inside the museum I overheard a docent question a patron with his Audio guide about showing his ticket. I was also accosted about my travel pack that had my paperback and sunglasses. They docent was not happy until took my book and tucked it under my arm and placed my sunglasses into my pocket.

The room 2 is really exceptional so if you are starting by the top, do not spend extra time there and enjoy the room 2.

In fact, I think that Gian Lorenzo Bernini's \"Apollo and Daphne\" is the most beautiful sculpture in the world. Wait till you see the nymph Daphne fleeing from handsome Apollo. As she prays for help from her father, also a divinity, she is turned into a laurel, and you see her toes and fingers sprouting roots and leaves. This isn't the only amazing work of art here, either.

You need to book well in advance (at least 3-7 days) for your appointed time and your time in the museum is limited (but adequate). It is not particularly easy to get to the Borghese, so plan for that and allow adequate travel time. The audio guide which you may rent is excellent.This was our second time in Rome and first time to the Borghese. This is #2 on my all-time list for Rome attractions behind only the Vatican Museum and its Sistine Chapel.Note with the Roma Pass the entry fee is heavily discounted (less than half price as I recall) but you will still need to reserve your spot well in advance and then be there at the appointed time.Your effort will be richly rewarded!"

You need to make reservations as they are strict about letting a certain number of people in during a 2-hour window. If you care anything about sculptor, this place will change your life. Bernini's work is prominently featured here, showing off some of his most famous pieces. The city of rome displays even more throughout the city in public spaces. I could return here many times and this place will always be on the list of must-sees."

I've read that you need reservations to get in, but we managed to get in without them, although this may be because we just happened to come at a time when reservations weren't necessary. The museum does require bag check-in though - no purses or anything like that, but you can keep your camera. :)I love Renaissance art, and art by Bernini is particularly awesome, so this museum was amazing. Seeing Apollo and Daphne in person was absolutely breathtaking, but every single room was full of masterful paintings and sculptures - even the ceilings were covered with them! I could see how those uninterested in art would be bored, as this museum requires an appreciation for the beauty of Renaissance art. But perhaps even those who aren't originally interested in art will soon find themselves mesmerized after visiting this museum."

The original sculptures and paintings in the Borghese Gallery date back to Cardinal Scipione's collection and they are truly amazing. Educational for teenagers. My two granddaughters were enthralled and intrigued by it all. Afterward stroll in the lovely gardens, have a ride on the train that goes around the complete park. You can then visit the zoo, small but nice. Allow a whole day for the entire experience."

The Gallery is housed in an impressive Villa that was set up to show off the collected works of Art displayed its individual rooms. Each room is also itself a work of art with suitable surroundings for each collection of statues and paintings set by period. Including masters Bernini, Caravaggio and Titian.Some rooms are sparse, some are busily ornate and some have three dimensional looking painting on the ceilings (Trompe l'oeil). It makes for an interesting additive to the displayed works of art which can be seen up close throughout the room. Some of the interesting items includes two identical marble statues of an Emperor. The second was produced in a week after the first showed a marble flaw. And the Abduction of Poserpina by Pluto statue in which the legend of her being turned into a Linden Tree to protect her is shown by moving around the statue from front to back to observe \" the transformation\" in minute details.. The Gallery is very worthwhile but may be a bit taxing for youngsters.Tip: There is a Gift shop and a small food bar (reasonable) in the basement (on the floor where one enters). Be sure to get your tickets over the internet for a timed slot before going. They are strict about time, and rules. Pick up an audio guide in your native language (for 5 Euros each) and use the numbers around each art piece to get details about them. It's also well worthwhile to save time before or after the tour to experience the surrounding Villa Borghese gardens."

If you only see Pluto and Persephone, and Apollo and Daphne, it's worth the visit - not to mention the other art and the building itself.My only suggestion is to make sure you have some cash with you after you check all of your items (including purses) at the door - because you will need to pay for the audio tour, if you choose to take it."

This is a gallery that is completely worth the little extra effort of getting tickets beforehand. I like to plan my sightseeing trips w/ a bit of flexibility built in...so I had avoided nailing down tickets for an exact date and entrance time. One quick hint when you visit...given that the gallery only allows 300 people in during every two hour window...the gallery entrance is a bit crowded as everyone starts their audioguide. Skip the ground floor and head upstairs to the paintings. I know it will be difficult to walk past all the gorgeous Bernini sculptures, but I promise it's worth it to enjoy them the second hour after the crowds have passed by! You'll practically have Bernini to yourself!We lived in Rome for six months and this was our favorite place to visit. It is truly extraordinary and a stop you will never forget!"

            "review": "Great little gallery. This is a great little gallery located in a very nice park (Villa Borghese) which you should also spend some time exploring. You need reservations for a 2-hour time slot to visit the gallery. They will ask you nicely to leave so that the next group can enter. You can try to get unclaimed time slots by waiting at the ticketing area at half past the hour. If you have reservations, you must claim them by half past the hour. If you are late, they give them away to those waiting for unclaimed tickets. I called from America to get my reservations - they gave me a confirmation # which I gave them at ticketing and paid for my tickets. You can also buy them on-line and exchange the confirmation e-mail for actual tickets. If you go at 9AM or 11AM, you can get a guided tour by a museum guide. This is highly recommended. We met the guide at 10 past the hour, she talked for a few minutes and then she let us to several rooms and showed us the highlights of the museum. The guided tour took about 75 minutes and then we had about a half hour to wander around. This worked perfectly as it allowed the people who weren't on the guided tour to get through the turnstiles and upstairs to the gallery. They only accept cash for the guided tour - 6 euros/person. Our guide was very knowledgeable and she gave you a better understanding of what you are looking at than if you just wandered around. Perhaps the audio guide would do just an adequate job as well - can't comment on that as we didn't get an audio guide.It's not a very big museum and 2 hours is adequate. It never felt crowded, not like at the Vatican Museum. There's a small caf\u00e9 (kind of pricey) and a small gift shop. All bags must be checked, even handbags. You can take pictures - no flash."

Maybe it was the 1.5 mile walk to the museum from the Piazza del Popolo that made me tired or the somewhat confusing walk through the Borghese Gardens(which are beautiful) that dampened my enthusiasm for the venue. However, I think the real culprit was the audio guide that I purchased to accompany my visit. Maybe it was just me, but I had difficulty matching the guide with the actual room I was in. Some were labeled one thing, but didn't match with the corresponding number on the audio guide. You also don't start in room 1, which they don't tell you unless you ask or notice that what the guide is talking about isn't what you're seeing. IMO, without the guide it is difficult to get much info on the pieces in each room(all placards are in Italian). They do have \"placemats\" in each room that has info on the pieces, but who wants to read all that?"

Make sure you print out your reservation details and bring them with you and book ahead. The next open tickets they had were for Tuesday afternoon. I thought no cameras were allowed, however, after checking my camera bag with the camera inside I found out otherwise. I was able to go back downstairs and get my camera. Found the sculptures to be amazing along with the ceiling artwork. Each room was a treat and I really liked the English guides provided in each room giving you a little peak in to what each room was about. We did not get the audio guide, but found that the sheets in each room were just enough for us. We took about 1.5 hours to see the whole gallery. The line for the bag check got long so we broke up and one got tickets while the other stood in the baggage check line. Being at the end of the line of people going in at 9 turned out to be good as the rooms weren't as crowded. There were some groups of teens being led by their own guides, which were kind of loud, but we were able to pick a different room at most times and it felt like having the gallery all to ourselves. A definite must see if you like painted ceilings and sculpture.We took the bus from the Plaza Repubblica and found it easy to find the gallery. Getting back out of the park to was a bit of an adventure, however, it is a beautiful park that is worth taking a little bit of time to explore after or before the gallery!"

Get reservations, and, if you have items you can't check, wear something (not a bag/purse) that you can carry them in.

And do not worry, one hour is enough, even for biggest art lovers to enjoy it! Plus, before closing, less people and more peace to enjoy. you can even take some photos secretly, as it is forbidden to photo."

Most upsetting, though, was the poor quality of the staff personnel. When we arrived, we saw a long queue to check bags; as we were carrying our passports and iPhones, we were nervous about this prospect and asked the ticket agent what the rules were. He gruffly brushed us off and gave no additional information. Only after waiting in the long queue did we realize that small bags were provided to visitors and that we could therefore still carry our passports and electronics we us through the museum.Also, we had tickets for the 5-7 block. For anyone buying tickets for that block: The museum store and cafe close at 6:30, leaving no time to shop or pick up a bite to eat for the way home. When we were leaving, we were hoping to catch the 95 bus back to the city center. We asked the previously-unhelpful ticket agent for advice regarding where to catch it. Without looking up from his computer, he said, \"We are closed.\" We tried again, stating that we just wanted to know where to catch the bus. He again replied, \"We are closed, madam.\" It was 6:30 -- our tickets went for another thirty minutes at that point!Incredibly poor service."

By that, I mean that the museum is small enough to see most of the works comfortably in the time allowed (approximately two hours). I also like that groups are limited to 360 people at a time, making the viewing of the rooms much more pleasant. In other museums, including the Vatican museums and the Louvre in Paris, an unlimited number of people are allowed to enter the museum at once, so that it is difficult to maneuver and to actually see the works of art. Here at the Borghese, you can move around quite easily and actually see the works you have paid to see. And the works themselves are well worth seeing--my particular favorites were Bernini's Apollo and Daphne and his version of David (which is quite different from either Michelangelo's or Raphael's). There are also beautiful works by Raphael, Titian, and Caravaggio, just to name a few. It is difficult to believe that one man, Cardinal Borghese, was able to accumulate this vast amount of artwork. You must, of course, buy tickets in advance, and you will be assigned a two-hour block of time. You can easily do this online. Please note that the place where you pick up your tickets is below the circular stairway at the front of the museum. Also be aware that the climb to the second floor of the museum is quite strenuous. I was not prepared for the number and steepness of the stairway leading to the upper floor of the gallery. But the museum is well worth the time and money. (Cost is about 13 euros per person.)"

Give yourself lots of time to arrive and find your way through the gardens to this location. Your ticket only allows you 2 hours in the gallery and you don't want to waste a minute. You will need a map to find your way here, unless you arrive by cab. The gardens are a lot bigger than you think. I can't say enough about the sculptures. After having seen Bernini's Apollo and Daphne so close that you could have touched it, and then to have to stand in a giant crowd at the Vatican to see his Piata behind glass, it makes you realize what a treat it is to be in this gallery. There is more fabulous art in this gallery than you could possibly appreciate with several visits. I recommend the audio guide to direct you to the major pieces in the gallery and then you can book back in again to view the other pieces on subsequent visits."

As soon as you walk throughout the entrance into the large reception hall your senses are sent into art heaven. The sumptuousness of the Villa is amazing. From the floor, the walls to the ceilings your eyes are given a feast. That is before you even take in the paintings and sculptures. Roman Gladiatorial mosaics line the floor, frescoes adorn the walls and ceilings. Sculptures from some of the most important artists of their periods are here. Upon walking into the second room I was in heaven. Not one but six Caravaggio's all in the same place. Two more are located in the other rooms. Incredible. This Galleria cannot be fully described or appreciated by words. It has to be seen. I would rate this as one of the most important and beautiful collections I have seen. It is worth its five stars based on the building and its art content. It is essential to book your ticket on line though since they only allow a limited number of visitors inside during two hour time slots. Both a blessing and a curse. Two hours is not quite long enough but it does prevent the terrible crowds that plague The Vatican Museum. The other downside was that some of the staff were extremely rude and brusque in their manner. Just wonderful."

There were tons of crying babies, and it was very distracting, especially having paid. I couldnt give five stars however because I spent so much time walking around in the crazy Roman heat, trying to find the museum. Once I finally found the building, it took another 10 minutes or so to figure out where to buy tickets. Maybe to some it was obvious, but there are zero signs. And the service is way understaffed- of course there are going to be lines if there is only one cashier at one of the most famous museums in Rome.

We followed our guidebook's advice to tour the upstairs painting galleries first and then head downstairs to see the sculptures. Since this is the opposite of what most visitors do, we found ourselves virtrually alone with some of the paintings (such as Bassano's Last Supper, with the cat under the table) at the beginning of our visit and with some of the sculptures (such as Lorenzo's Apollo and Daphne) at the end."

While in Rome, we visited Galleria Borghese and it was spectacular. You will need to reserve before your arrival (you can sometimes pick up 'no show' tickets) because they only allow 350 guests in every two hours (and make you leave at the end of your time). This eliminates the crush found in most European galleries. Before your entry time, we recommend joining a tour with an art historian or renting one of the audio players to give you a better understanding of what you're looking at. On entry, go straight to the second floor which is all paintings and very interesting. Almost everyone goes to the first floor first so you'll be relatively alone when you get down there. The reason I found this museum so great was the first floor is almost entirely statues, mostly be Bernini. Michelangelo will always be first but Bernini does things with marble that are unbelievable. We'll go there every time we're in Rome."

I thought the whole thing would be a hassle - being tied to a specific time, having to hand over ID for an audio guide, put off by reports of surly staff! Well, don't dither as I did and get on with booking your tickets! I'm so glad that I did as the Borghese turned out to be one of the highlights of our holiday. It was a little far from our hotel but we took a taxi there so as to be sure not to miss our slot. We arrived about 45 minutes before our 11am visit. Collecting the tickets was completely hassle free - we took all our internet documents with us. We then had time for a coffee before getting our audio guides. I was prepared and handed over my driving licence as collateral so that was hassle free too. Then we got into the queue and were quite near the front when we were let in at 11am.My partner had a small bag with him and he did not have to check it but it is always good advice to ask at the cloakroom beforehand. Photographs without flash are allowed. We started in the pinoteca and there is so much good stuff there. Perhaps the biggest problem is that because your time is restricted in this section, I don't think there's time to listen to all the audio guide entries here so you have to be selective. My favourite things though were on the ground floor. I never expected to be so swept away by statues but the Bernini sculptures in particular as just fascinating and beautiful. His 'Apollo & Daphne' is almost worth the ticket price alone! In addition to all this, every room in the villa as sumptuously decorated - most rooms have painted ceilings. Two hours is plenty of time to see everything and the audio guide is very good. I would say that if you are even slightly interested in art, the Borghese Gallery is a must visit when in Rome...but do book in advance!"

I wanted to see Daphne and Apollo again, I was so taken with the piece at 21. I didn't need a guide then. You will need one today. I guess Bernini has been \"discovered\". The gallery wasn't badly crowded and we weren't rushed at all. I thought it wonderful, and afterward, we roamed the grounds a bit."

We had already seen \"the must do's\" of Rome or so we thought until we came to the Borghese Gallery. The Borghese Park that we walked through in order to get to the Gallery was gorgeous in and of itself. After getting your tickets down the stairs in the center of the palazzo you proceed up the staircase to enter the museum. The minute you step into the palazzo that was built just to house this amazing collection you are lost in the beauty of not only the art, but also the architecture and decorative arts used to frame the pieces inside. The Bernini sculptures took my breath away. Truly. This is a \"must do\" in Rome."

In my naivety I thought I could get them 5 days in advance, but I was to be disappointed. This trip in 2014 meant that I stayed one day longer than my tour group just to visit it.It is well worth it, particularly for the works of sculpture by Bernini. Get your tickets online before you go. You are limited to 2 hours so make sure you redeem your ticket voucher a good 1/2 to 1 hour in advance so you can make the most of your time once your time to enter arrives. Don't bother getting the ticket express post to you, printing off the voucher works just fine. My ticket was 11 Euro which I got on line 3 or 4 months in advance... you just need to know the day and time you want to visit. When I redeemed my ticket they were selling tickets 'at the door' for a week later, nothing was available sooner. I went on a Sunday and so Also enjoyed the Borghese Gardens... about a 3/4 hour stroll to Piazza Popolo where you can catch the metro back into the heart of Rome. (Two great Carrivaggio in one of the churches in Piazza Popolo... but I saw those last visit, this visit was on a Sunday so only open to those attending mass."

I visited three of the four Rome National museums -- this better all of them. More in intact sculptures and everything is set in absolultely beautiful rooms. Some important notes:(1) GET TICKETS IN ADVANCE. There was no walk-up when we were there -- there was a sign that tickets were sold out for the next four days.(2) They are serious about not letting you in with a bag or large purse. They will turn you away at the entrance to check your bag and then you get back into the line -- at the back of the line. And, you only have two hours in the museum.(3) We took pictures inside! Guidebooks say that you cannot take pictures, but my wife was told to keep her purse when she was checking her purse. No staff stopped me from taking lots of pictures throughout the place.(4) People move through the museum as a big group because everyone enters at the same time. You don't need to stay with everyone else. We went back to the \"first\" room about an hour and half into our visit and it was completely empty. (Nice for pictures.)(5) There is food in the basement, but few seats.(6) As part of your visit to the museum, you can spend time in the Borghese park, too. We went on a Sunday afternoon and did a bicycle ride around the park as part of our visit. (Then, we went over the TechnoTown, but that's another story.)"

I can tell you that the staff at this particular museum was the least friendly and least helpful of any place I visited; some of them were just outright rude and offensive.

Then you line up with the others scheduled at your time and like a herd of cattle you are let into the building. The first floor is large and if you listen to the audio recordings where you are supposed to, it will take an hour. DO NOT stop at the cafe or the bathroom on the way to the second floor or you won't have enough time to explore all of the rooms up there. We did and were sorry. Though the Gallery says you are allotted two hours to see everything, the security and attendants start chasing you out more than 10 minutes before you time is us. Because we needed a quick snack and were chased from the gallery early, we missed about 4-6 rooms upstairs, as did many of the people in our time frame. If you listen to everything you are supposed to on the audio the tour definitely takes more than the two hours max you are given and before of that, I am giving this an average rating. Also, the place is severely lacking in toilets in both the gallery and in the gardens--especially for the volume of summer visitors."

The place: First, the building (and surrounding buildings) is beautiful. Secondly, the massive park that spreads out before it (Villa Borghese) is absolutely phenomenal. If I lived in Rome, I would be running through that park every single day. The general emplacement of the park and museum offers you a much needed break from the hustle and bustle of Rome. It's quiet, peaceful and secluded. The art: Definitely one of my favorite museums, for it's fabulous sculptors by some of Rome's best artists. I mean, you can't go wrong with this museum. You must look up when you visit the museum because the ceilings offer you beautiful paintings. You just want to lie down on the floor and stare up at them. One of the definite perks of this place is that they only allow 300 people in every 2 hours, so there is no pushing or shoving, no one getting into your personal space and pressing up against you to gaze into the eyes of a sculpture. I saved this for the end of my stay in Rome and I'm glad I did. Price point: 11 Euro, and remember to book online before you leave so you can skip the lines."

The gardens around the gallery are beautiful plan for a nice walk around them."

The four masterpieces by Bernini are worth the entry fee alone, especially on my part The David. My wife loved the Apollo and Daphne. The Canova \"Pauline Bonaparte\" is very interesting too. Since paintings are my forte, it was great to see works by Caravaggio, Raphael, Titian, a hidden Vasari (blink and you'll miss it), a Botticelli (not in guide), the list goes on...And don't forget one of the few female artists of the time Lavinia Fontana...Our tour lasted 2 hours, but you could do with more. Having an excellent guide was a bonus, there are audio guides too of course. Photography is allowed, but I got told off for using a video camera. Mind you this was in the last room, so I'd got away with using it throughout the rest of the gallery!"

The sculptures, the paintings, the villa, and the grounds were all extraordinary. I would like to share a few tips for the best possible experience:- Make a reservation by phone - no fee - they give you a confirmation number.- Buy the Roma Pass - admission to the Borghese and Colosseum alone cover the pass and you get 3 days of unlimited buses, metro, and other bonuses.- Arrive half an hour early. You have to check in to get your tickets and all bags and cameras must be left at bag check.- When they let you into the museum go straight to the 2nd floor. 75% of the crowd will start on the first floor. Art in nicer with fewer people between you and the masterpiece.- We were at the museum in late April. It was warm and humid inside. There is an outdoor patio with sculptures and benches where you can cool off."

Print out the email receipt and hand in at the desk to collect your tickets. All bags must be checked into the cloak room. Make sure you allow time to collect the tickets and to drop off your bags. 2 hours is easily enough time to see the whole gallery. It is a very pleasant experience strolling around with a limited number of people.As we were the last session of the day the shop was closed when we were finished. Bear this in mind and visit the shop before the gallery, if you are there for the last session.If you walk through the park and are going to catch the metro from Spagna station, please note it is a long walk from the metro sign to the actual station!"

Far more impressive, in my opinion, than Vatican because the number of visitors is restricted and traffic regulated which allows for leisure viewing. Apollo and Daphne is truly breathtaking. Now, be prepared to be abused, insulted, condescended by the staff at galleria Borghese. I presented my prepurchased tickets to the one and only person checking in all those in the 9 to 11 viewing and she was pissed because evidently one must bring copy of the invoice as well - almost dismissed me expecting I would walk away - good thing I'm from New York. The person where one checks in personal belongings mumbled something about what may be brought in and what may not before grabbing my bag and tossing the check my way. There were no brochures in English (needles to say many English speakers in the crowd), when someone asked, they just pointed at the stack where everyone had already looked. The people at the coffee shop, by far the nicest of the bunch, make very good coffee. Enjoy."

I am not sure why Borghese Gallery is considered so special among the Rome museums that a reservation is required in advance in order to the visit the museum, the museum guide calls it the best in Rome (and even the world?) and the washrooms are only accessible if you present your ticket ( really?). I almost feel like there is some kind of hype generated here, because the art collection is not that big or great, certainly less than Palazzo Barberini that was virtually empty when I visited it. Don't get me wrong, there *is* some worthy art here, but I would say the Barberini has the more extensive and better art collection, virtually no crowds, and the mansion itself is stunning inside. And it does not require reservations. If you have limited time, that is the one to go to, not the Borghese Gallery."

My partner booked tickets for us to the Galleria Borghese two and a half weeks before we went to Rome. First he had asked a mate in Milan if it was necessary to buy tickets in advance and this mate didn't really think so, but after reading advice on TripAdvisor I insisted that he call the gallery and ask. Then he was allowed tickets on the Friday we wanted but at 17:00 hrs (last entry of the day closing at 19:00 hrs.) instead of at 11:00 am as we had originally thought. This may prove that Italians themselves do not visit their own museums very often, as if we had listened to this friend\u2019s advice we would not have got in. So, booking well ahead is essential! When we arrived a little early I was somewhat startled to find that all visitors had to leave their bags, cameras, telephones etc. with a security reception \u2013 it was difficult being parted from my bag with wallet, plastic cards, mobile etc. and my partner had to hand in his zoom lens camera \u2013 but we and everyone else received a numbered tag to guarantee safe keeping of belongings. There were two security guards in the reception who assured that all belongings would be safe, so we decided to relax and trust that. The Galleria\u2019s book and gift shop is right beside the security reception, we bought the Galleria\u2019s own book instead of the audio guide, anything bought in the shop was allowed in, this was nice to refer to when at the specific masterpiece. When we and all others were allowed in at 17:00 hrs it was a delight to be surrounded by the most wonderful paintings and sculptures \uf04a My partner had especially come to see Bernini\u2019s Rape of Persephone, one of the main exhibits in the Galleria. This marvel we found almost at once just by walking straight ahead into the first room from the main entrance hall \u2013 it is a wonder of course, how someone managed to make such a statue out of marble \u2013 stone \u2013 and then to make it so full of life and beauty, in spite of the subject of Spring itself being seized and drawn down into the underworld. The genius Bernini was also responsible for the lovely Apollo and Daphne, the god and the wood nymph turning into a tree, so beautiful from whatever angle you look at it. There was much to see at the Galleria, each room seemed to be filled with more paintings and statues, we also went upstairs to the second floor, less crowded and more spacious but also here the walls were hung with paintings absolutely worth the climb up the stairs. We both love Caravaggio, and room 8 of the Galleria is filled with his paintings, fantastic! Caravaggio\u2019s art was controversial in his own time, not very difficult to understand but he was surely an artistic genius. Something else very special about this room is the ceiling! People look up when you are in room 8, there are fantastic paintings of incredibly lifelike 3-dimensional Satyrs who almost seem to be coming down (!) from the ceiling at you! Don\u2019t miss this! When you go out the door to the right and into the main hall again (where everyone comes in) Look up again at the ceiling in this room! Exquisitely painted \u2013 no satyrs here but beautiful pastoral scenes. It\u2019s good to just stand still, look up while resting head on hands for support, and enjoy what you see. We thoroughly enjoyed our hour and a half (didn\u2019t need 2 hours) at the Galleria Borghese and recommend to all Travellers who enjoy Italian masterpieces, worth every cent of the ticket price! And indeed our belongings were safely collected from security!"

Most people seem to use the audio guide, but we opted for the English language tour, which was only a little more, and was worth it to me. I don't know if we just got lucky, but our tour only had six people! Our tour guide was very knowledgeable about the collection, and provided information not just about the art, but about the space as well (what the rooms had been used for, changes in them, etc.) I enjoy art and have taken some art history classes, but having a tour guide helped me notice more subtle details that really make some of the pieces impressive. The tour probably isn't necessary to appreciate the museum, but I definitely recommend it."

The museum is closed on Mondays and unfortunately there is no picture taking. There are audio guides (in five languages) and guided tours (only in English and Italian). This impressive building was once the residence of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope Paul V, and now as an art gallery includes works by some of the most brilliant Italian and foreign artist including Titian, Caravaggio, Bernini, Raphael, Rubens, Canova and many others. The ground floor is mostly devoted to classical antiquities of the 1st\u20133rd centuries AD. My favorites include Bernini's sculptures \"Apollo and Daphne\" and \"Rape of Proserprina\" but his sculpture \"Truth Unveiled\" and his David are also magnificent. Canova's sculptue \"Pauline Bonaparte\" is the center focus of another room. The Borghese also houses The National Museum of Musical Instruments a collection of instruments from around the world. And of course there's a gift shop, as well as a small cafeteria on the below ground level."

You must get timed tickets in advance (at least several weeks) then pick them up at the box office window. You must also check any cameras, backpacks or large bags, although I was allowed to hang onto my purse. Tickets are for specific times and you only get 2 hours to view the gallery, so you must really hurry if you want to see it all. Once inside the gallery, don't start in the first room, move into another room to avoid the crowds that start in that first room. Each room has a theme and unbelievable treasures. Many of the rooms have beautifully frescoes walls and ceilings, as well as paintings, sculptures and mosaic floors. As another poster mentioned, the statue of Apollo Chasing Daphne is probably the finest piece in the entire gallery, and the most beautiful sculpture I've seen except for the Pieta. In each room look for a small rack that holds laminated cards about 11x18, that describe all the items in the room. These cards are in different languages, some have English on one side and Italian on the other, and sometimes you will need more than one card per room (one describes the frescoes and another the paintings). You use it while in the room then return it to the rack for the next visitor. Very helpful. After visiting the gallery, be sure to spend a little time strolling through the grounds. It is lovely and peaceful and from the gardens, you can't even hear the hustle and bustle of Roman traffic around you. This gallery is not as well known as the other attractions (Vatican, Colosseum, Forum) but it is well worth the visit."

There's high demand for this gallery and they limit the places with rigid 2 hour time slots to control crowding. The tours in English (extra 6.50 euro) are in the morning and are well worth doing if you're not a renaissance art expert. The sculptures show a lot of the process of creation if you understand the process or get educated via the tour. It would have been nice to have an extra 15 minutes post tour to browse around. There's also an audio guide for 5 euros (cash only, of course.)It does have the usual Italian features as per Ctemple27's recent review. I was there on the Sunday and thought I'd book for later in the week when I was planning to use my Roma Pass. I was told that I had to call the phone line to book which, of course, was closed on a Sunday. When I questioned remaining availability for my last two days in Romes it was low and therefore likely that there would be no availability by the time I could reserve a place. In an unusual and refreshing move the member of staff realised this was a ridiculous predicament and gave me a reservation number.Closed on Mondays like majority of Rome's museums. After all, massive demand in tourist season, why not close on an arbitrary day? You expect this weirdness in France but the Italians have followed suit.The park is very nice too and a wonderful place to get away from the traffic and siren noise of Rome."

I was a little worried at not having something in writing, but as we used this as part of our Roma Pass, I didn't want to advance pay for tickets and it turned out to be no issue by phone, for free. As far as the bad reviews from people who just turned up and didn't get in-it's not hard at all to discover that reservations are required and you usually only have to plan a couple weeks in advance. Unless you read absolutely nothing prior to arriving in Rome, the required reservations will not come as a shock.-It may seem stingy to limit the number of people allowed in and the time you're allowed to peruse, but we found 2 hours to be plenty of time to see everything and it was nice not to have to fight the crowds to see something. There were a few museums we visited during our time in Italy that we actually left after 20 minutes or so because you just couldn't see anything without having 20 others people right by you, in your line of vision, stepping on your toes, etc. Not so at the Borghese and that makes for a much more pleasant visit.-The park surrounding the museum is lovely and it was nice to see some locals walking dogs, walking or jogging. It was a nice break from the usual chaos of Rome and felt like a world apart by the time we reached museum.Cons:-This is not a museum you can get through without using the museum's audioguide, a detailed guidebook or hiring a guide/tour. While I realize this is the reason museum's offer audioguides and Italy especially seems to rely on these rather than give good explanations of the art near the displays, I don't like having my hand forced. The Borghese is already expensive. To then have to pay extra to understand what I'm looking at is disappointing. Were I an art scholar or paid the extra money for one of the above options, I wouldn't have had this problem. But I would prefer that the option to learn more be an option rather than the rule and at the Borghese, never mind learning more-you don't even get a simple explanation of what it is you're looking at. There's a portrait of a woman...and that's all you know. No mention of the artist, date, who the woman might be, etc. Maybe I'm a spoiled American who has gotten used to having these little signs at the art museums I visit, but we visited numerous museums in Italy where they explained what we were looking at. If we wanted to know more about the piece, we would have to pay for an audioguide, etc., but the information about the piece itself was evident. The Borghese didn't do this and as a result, you're either lost or giving up more of your money to learn the basic facts about the art around you.-Most of the art is unexceptional, in my opinion. Lovely, but nothing that really sticks out. I should add that I am more of a history fan and not into sculpture so maybe that's why this didn't thrill me. But for the most part the pieces look like a lot of other art you see in a lot of other museums in Rome. And I say this without the conflict of museum fatigue as we visited the Borghese on our 3rd day in Italy. Also, while I have no problem with their no pictures policy, this actually made our visit to the Borghese worse because I can remember almost nothing save for a few Caravaggios. So that tells you the lasting impression the art had on me.If you're an art scholar/fan and/or don't mind paying extra for an audioguide, your own guide or a book that walks you piece by piece through the museum, then the advance planning and cost the Borghese requires won't bother you in the least. If you're only moderately into art and would rather just see the \"big stuff\", there are plenty of other, better ways to spend your time in Rome. I read that advice in several places and ignored it because this museum kept being touted as a \"Must See.\" Now I wish I would have listened and spent my time more wisely. For the average tourist, it doesn't live up to the hype."

Cardinal Scipione Borghese was a true protector of the arts and commissioned a young Bernini. Here you will find Bernini's \"Proserpine's Rape\", \"Apollo and Daphne\" and \"David throwing a sling\". l could not stop staring at the astounding Proserpine and Pluto sculpture. Pluto is holding her and the pressure of his fingers is leaving imprints on her thigh and abdomen. It made me want to cry..this is stone! The Galleria is divided in two sections: the Museum is on the ground floor and displays the sculptures, while on the upper floor the Galleria houses its collection of amazing paintings. Several important paintings are here, among them outstanding works by Titian and Raphael. My favorites are the beautiful Caravaggio masterpieces: the \"Madonna of the Grooms\", \"St. Jerome\", \"St. John Baptist\", \"David with Goliath's head\", \"Young man with a Fruit basket\", and the \"Little Bacchus\" .A couple hints:- Book your tickets online, only x number of people are allowed in for 2 hours only. This means you will run out of time. Do your research first and determine which pieces are most important to you. Visit them first, then rest of collection. When they told me time was up I wanted to hide someplace so I could stay. - Get an audio guide. They are essential unless you are a knowledgeable art historian.- Do not bring a camera and knapsack. If you do you will need to check them. NO pictures.- Give yourself lots of time to get there. When you ask a Roman for directions and they say 'it's just over there'..over there can be 2 miles."

The pieces by Bernini and Caravaggio were truly amazing. Our guide was also the best of our many tours in Rome. Rebecca is an American guide living in Rome. Her knowledge of art history was incredible. Her energy and passion for the masterpieces at the Bourghese Gallery was contagious, and her charm made the tour very enjoyable. Of course, her ease of communicating in American English was also a huge plus. She even recommended other tours and local restaurants for us afterwards, so we can\u2019t say enough good things about her. If only all of our tours were as nice! The Borghese Park, which surrounds the museum, is free and very beautiful too. A nice afternoon could be had picnicking in the park, enjoying the grounds, and then going on this tour with Rebecca.

You must also appreciate their policy of strictly no bags (including purse) inside if you have been swiped/hit many times (like me) by the big backpacks some people carry around to sightseeing (what's in it any way, why burden with a big bag all day?). With these very sensible policies, you can really enjoy the great paintings, master works of Bernini's sculptures and the beautiful historical building itself in relative serenity and easy pace (2 hours are sufficient to see every piece of artwork). Although sadly, their policy still couldn't weed out all rude tourists, some of whom I saw 'smuggled' bags in and took pictures while the staff was distracted. Despite of that, the bonus of touring the gallery is that you can have a nice stroll through the beautiful park Villa Borghese afterward.

You can also hire bikes and go karts cheaper. They were setting up some sort of show while we were there but it didn't matter its sucha huge place. Great vews. Welcome shade and welcome concrete after all those cobbled streets. Wortha viist for a stroll, chill out from city and picnic."

            "review": "Outstanding Sculpture and Paintings. This small art museum boasts some of the best Bernini sculptures in the world, which is usually my main reason for visiting. I also enjoy looking at the wonderful paintings by famous artists, such as Caravaggio, Titian, Raphael, Peter Paul Rubens and Veronese. These works were collected by Cardinal Borghese, who was a patron of Bernini.The museum consists of 20 rooms on two floors with dozens of steps between the floors. An elevator at the rear of the building is available for those in wheelchairs. An audio guide is available and useful. There are brochures in various languages, but the museum was out of English pamphlets on my last visit.The museum has rules that visitors should be aware of before going. First, admission is for a limited number of visitors at a specified time for two hours only. So, if you have a ticket for 10 a.m., you are not admitted before precisely 10 a.m. Though you can enter within the 2-hour time period (10-12), you must leave at noon. I have found two hours to be sufficient time to see the works. Second, you must check bags, including purses, at a room next to the ticket office at the museum's lowest level. There are no lockers. Be sure that you keep anything of value with you. I have noted some visitors carrying Ziploc-type bags that hold money, a passport, etc. Third, photography is not allowed.I advise buying tickets in advance on-line. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get same-day tickets, because of the museum's popularity and the increased number of people traveling. As an example, I purchased on-line tickets for last Saturday. When I arrived, a notice announced that tickets were sold out until Thursday. A Giacometti exhibition brought me to the museum on Saturday (two days ago). This show features just 28 sculptures and six paintings, displayed throughout the permanent collection. I found this to be an awkward presentation, because it was not obvious where each work was exhibited. But these were good examples of what Giacometti has done and all were worthwhile seeing. The museum has a small, basic cafe near the ticket office. There are many nice restaurants nearby.We took the 910 bus from Rome's central station. This brought us to a stop that was a 1-minute walk to the gallery. There are other buses, of course, that go near the gallery but I doubt any would bring you as close as the 910."

The art is easier to view and it was a more enjoyable experience. The entrance is a 10-15 minute walk from either stopping point for vehicles so you need to arrive early for your appointment and allow for the walk (even tho you may be advised that the museum is \"just a minute down that road\"). Check your purse contents before and after the mandatory storage...The park is a lovely city park; think Central or Lincoln or Golden Gate. You need to wander around and discover it - enjoy."

            "review": "\"Amazing Borghese\". Like other reviewers mentioned you need to prebook online. Tours run every 2 hrs starting at 9am. We booked the 9am slot and I was glad we did. It is necessary to arrive early to show your reservation, pick up your tickets, check your bag/purse and rent an audioguide if you want one. You are not allowed to check jackets. Around 8:30am or so it is relatively uncrowded to do this. We found it best in Rome to do everything early. When we were leaving at 11am and the next tour was coming in it was jammed. We were let into the gallery at 9 on the dot. It was not that crowded as we seemed to be ahead of the tours. We were able to view the amazing rooms of sculptures with very few people present. It got crowded later on and we tried to do different rooms than the tours. 350 people are allowed in every 2 hrs. Despite the ban on cameras, I saw a teenage boy snapping away but later on noticed he had put his camera away. There is a long flight of stairs to the second story. I did see a very small elevator but not sure if you need permission to use it. Just ask. When you have left try and zip down to baggage check for your bag as the line gets very long when everyone is retrieving theirs at the same time. They advertise a cafe but it is not the most pleasant and would recommend somewhere else unless you desperately need a cup of joe. We walked in the outside area afterwards. Will have great memories of the beautiful Borghese."

Tip: Start the tour backwards since everyone else is going in the same direction and you'll have the works to yourself. Personally I find this much more enjoyable as I find people distracting. The audio tour is great! Spend the extra few dollars if your not an art expert and it makes it all much more interesting and fun. That's me - no expert but I like the stories behind the works.Enj"

You can't just show upthey won't let you in. Its good that they do this since it would have way too many peoplegoing in. With the ticket and a scheduled time to see the exhibits - the experience isvery good. Bernini, Canova, and Caravaggio are the most prominent artist's.If you are coming from the Stazione Termini (the main train station) the #910 bus leavesfrom the bus lot at the train station and goes by the Galleria about 2 blocks after it turns north at the edge of the park. Another bus #16 coming from the Campo D' Fiore The #16is an electric powered minibus and is an interesting route right through the middle of the historic heart of Rome and has its turn around location at about 200 m south of the Galleria Borghese. Even my brother - who didn't want to go in, said afterwards that it wasa really wonderful co9lletion of art !!!"

It is a collection of classical art and sculpture and a good tip is to enter at your time and go straight to the 2nd floor and start there leaving most people on the ground floor! If you don't do the Vatican Museums then I would suggest doing this instead coupled with a pleasant day in the park."

The incredible vitality in this work is astounding,considering it was commissioned in 1623 by a sculptor barely 25,capturing the energy of motion as if it was a snapshot in time. The look of Dephne's expression,immortalised in the act of changing into a Laural tree, is one of disbelief and despair. With her forward-leaning posture,Apollo,who has just caught up with her, places his hand on her hip,only to find it has turned to bark. With this virtuousity, Bernini succeeded in transforming the words of Ovid into physical reality. Its all here at the Villa Borghese,the cardinal \"Villa of delights\". The positioning of the sculpture to the side of the room from which we observe Apollo from behind,as the god was nearing the end of his race to reach the object of his desire,with the drapery on his body still evoking the impression of movement. Then, as you move around the statue their dramatic expressions take centre-stage."

The only negative is that you are only allotted 2 hours there and you could easily spend a lot more time. My one suggestion is to not spend more than 45 minutes upstairs, the first floor that you get to see. The lower floor is far more impressive, far more and you will want to give it its due.Afterwards, take a walk in the park. The next time I go to Rome, I will spend 1-2 weeks there and spend a good deal of it relaxing in the park and seeing all of many attractions they have there."

The English speaking tour guides that work for the Gallery are great. It costs something like 10 euros per person and you just purchase your ticket when you enter the museum. Beautiful paintings, statutes, furnishings and amazing history! Afterwards walk around the Borghese Gardens, which like Central Park in NYC have a Merry Go Round, fountains, gardens and horses driven carriages. We walked through the Gardens to the Spanish Steps. Great time and even our 15 year old enjoyed!"

I say this since you are limited to two hours and that's it! Our tour guide was able to condense the visit and focus on the most significant pieces while working in the story and history of the Gallery and the Borghese family. Since Bernini and Caravaggio are two of our most favorite Italian artists, this gallery was the pinnacle for seeing their works. You can see Bernini's evolution as an artist as you stroll through the gallery. Highly recommend but plan in advance or miss out!"

The park setting is lovely and in the quiet of the early morning we enjoyed a stroll from the bus stop through some of the park. We had read that we should start in the upstairs picture gallery. It turned out we didn't have a choice as everyone with electronic reservations had to enter through the lower entrance which led only to the upstairs rooms (lots of stairs). We felt we had ample time to stroll through both floors but we would recommend ending on the ground floor as you may be able to spend more time viewing the famous sculptures without large groups. The rooms themselves must be admired as well. Be sure to read about the history of the villa and collection. Each room has cards about the rooms and also the art, including English. They give a different (more positive) spin about the founder and his collecting. You really MUST make advance reservations. People without reservations found the next tickets were for 5-6 days later."

The only word to describe it is stunning. It was even better than I remembered and as a fifteen year old back then, I was so impressed that the memory of the amazing sculptures in particular never left me. My cousin who lives in Rome went along with me - he had never visited it and he rated it as the best visual art experience in Rome - on a par with the Sistine Chapel and St Peter's Basilica. I would not argue with that verdict.You have to book tickets in advance and this can be done on the internet. There are discounts for the elderly, children and teachers. You pay online and pick the tickets up in the gallery on the day of your visit. You choose a date and a time slot. The time slot is two hours and if you love sculpture, painting and architecture then you will need every minute of that time. The time slot is strictly adhered to and the gallery is cleared before the next viewing begins. I have tried several times to get in on the day and failed miserably so do book in advance.You cannot take your bags or a camera into the gallery but the system for depositing and retrieving these is very straight forward. There are toilets, a cafe and a gift shop that you can use before you enter the gallery and again after your visit.The sculptures are mainly on the first level and the paintings on the second and the rooms are numbered so you can visit in sequence and there is a reasonably priced guide book taking you through the rooms in several languages. It would have been worth a visit to see just one of the world famous sculptures or paintings let alone the whole collection."

Now I'll grant you, we could have been tired, it might have been an off day, who knows. I did make a reservation, and they do reserve a specific time for your entrance. There was no line, however it was mid-March, and that should be taken into consideration. Right outside is this HUGE park/gardens. It was lovely. Filled with vegetation and people having a great time. This would be a wonderful way to spend a day. Take a picnic, see the museum, chill outside with a bottle of Chianti, cheese, bread, and fruit. Give yourself time to enjoy all that it offers instead of a 2 hour museum visit. PS, they will ask you to leave your purse or pack. Take your ID, cards, etc, with you. Bottom line: I would go back, if only because I cannot recall what the heck I saw the first time.....which may, or may not, be a statement in itself."

Just as you can see all you need to know about French impressionists in the Musee d'Orsay, and all about Austrian modernism in the Vienna's Belvedere, the Borghese Gallery offers a great glimpse on the (mainly) Italian baroque. Here, you can easily follow the development of the baroque painting from the 15th to the 18 century.Yes, there are more paintings in the Louvre or in the Musei Vaticani, but then, their collections are not so intense and focused. The Borghese Gallery offers great paintings collection of Caravaggio, and pieces from Titian, Rubens, Bassano, etc. One of the high points of the collection are the sculptures from Bernini, which you have to see to believe that the marble can be carved so delicately and lively. Also, there are numerous (and very good) antique Roman sculptures, and the interior of the building is a jewel in itself, with all the frescos, stuccos, marbles, and impressive halls. This was my third time to visit, it is that good. Tickets must be purchased weeks in advance, the visit lasts max. 2 hours. Don't miss it."

The Borghese Gallery is a delightful, small gallery packed with sculpture on the first floor and paintings on the second floor. The museum is so popular that they limit your time to a 2 hour visit. Spend this time wisely - we got so caught up with the sculptures that we had only 20 minutes left for the paintings upstairs. There are some remarkable Bernini pieces in the sculpture gallery, including the Rape or Persephone, which is just mind-blowing. Upstairs in the portrait gallery, there are several Bernini self-portraits and some lovely Caravaggios among other wonderful works. We loved the Borghese Garden as much as the gallery. I recommend renting a little golf cart to explore the gardens and see all of the views, even if it's just to narrow down where you want to walk or spend more time. The garden is so huge, it's really impossible to walk it all on foot. The area around the Medici Villa is absolutely gorgeous and some incredible views of the city are available by the villa. Spend the day at the Borgehese, then walk down the Spanish Steps and into the heart of Rome. Dinner at Il Falchetto would be a lovely way to finish the day!"

An amazing wiew on Rome, a lake with boats, a little train, a Theater, and many interesting Monuments and attractions (like Zoo). And there are some \"Bistrots\" to eat something...I usually suggest to my Guests of the Domus Ciancaleoni, to visit it, because it is an amazing experience. It id necessary to reserve by phone or email, because the visits (leght of each visit : 2 hours) are done only in little group of persons.Visits starts from 9 am. The last visit is at 17 h. I warmly recommend this place!"

They really limit the number allowed (in two hour blocks) but it makes the experience inside the museum very enjoyable. Both the permanent exhibits (lovely sculptures and paintings) as well as the traveling additions are wonderful and not in such number that it is overwhelming. Beautiful Berninis, Boticellis, Raphels, and a small collection of Carrivagios delite the eye but almost like a nice antipasto, whet the pallet enough to leave you desiring more, as opposed to feeling visually overwhelmed. The sculptures are fantastic in both number and subject matter. Perfect when traveling with children to expose them to Renaissance art and some of the more famous artists without wearing out their attention. Absolutely worth the ticket and time to book ahead for any and all appreciators of Italian art."

A stroll through the rooms is like leafing through a text of the greatest hits from 1475 to 1780. The building has been renovated and the physical plant improved--although some areas are still muggy hot and the lights went out twice during our visit. The decorations and frescoes are pristine. Even the exterior of the building is fresh and clean. In 1975, on my first visit, I sat and gazed at Titian's \"Sacred and Profane Love\" for a bit over an hour; I don't think more than a couple of people came in the room all that time. I wrote in my journal and just looked at the painting. Today, of course one has a timed ticket: there is a two-hour period during which one must see everything, however long one wants to circle Bernini's \"Daphne and Apollo\" (my husband's favorite) or look back and forth between the self-portraits in Caravaggio's \"David and the Head of Goliath\" and \"Self Portrait with Basket of Fruit\" or get all dreamy over Raphael's \"Deposition.\" It's a mob as the time slot starts; after about 75 minutes, the crowds thin out perceptibly. Hold on to those last 15 minutes--the building will be nearly empty, if you are lucky.Let's talk reservations, though. Understand this: the chances that you will be able to walk up to the Borghese Gallery and buy tickets for the next time of entry is slim and none. You may well not be able to get tickets that fit into your stay at all. You have to reserve tickets significantly in advance by computer when you are making your travel plans. At least a month in advance. Truly. Yes that ties you into a specific moment when you might want to be doing something else, and yes, it costs an extra 2 euros handling fee per ticket, but that's life. Yes, there are those mythical \"cancellations\" that open up space. I wouldn't count on it, though, and absolutely not if you are traveling any time except maybe November through February.Thinking you'll use this costly ticket to help defray the cost of your Roma Pass? Think again. Because of the way a Roma Pass works, you won't be able to get the Pass, go to the Borghese (and the Coliseum or whatever) before you do anything else. The Roma Pass may work for you (it didn't for us, but that's another post) but don't require the Borghese to be part of the story. Remember that they will make you check your backpacks, sacks, pocketbooks and cameras. All of it. Security at the garderoba is good, but I do get nervous leaving my all in the control of strangers. Afterwards stroll back down the Via Veneto, past Piazza Barberini and head to the via Panetteria for the BEST gelato at San Crispino. Or wind down the paths in the massive park that is the Villa Borghese. There's a zoo for the kids, the Museum of Modern Art and the Villa Julia (Etruscan art). End up at the Piazza del Popolo where you can people watch and enjoy an espresso. It will be a great day!"

You can see all the sculptures from all sides. There is an amazing amount of art. Like any museum, you could be overwhelmed or be selective in your viewing. It is worth getting a guidebook in advance and figuring out what you want to see. (Rick Steve's has plenty of information on this museum and makes it very manageable.) We did get the audio guide. It certainly was not the best in the world but, does provide some guidance if you are not overly familiar with the art. This museum is not to be missed!

I just finished that they allowed pictures. We used the Roma pass to pay for the attraction. Once you purchase your Roma pass you need to call to make an appointment. Good thing I made the appointment before leaving for our vacation. The day we had our tour people were being turned away since the Galleria was fully booked. The next available day was two days later."

We had a friend suggest to book a ticket in advance (as we were going in June, peak tourism time) and are SO thankful we did! Several people I talked to waiting in line were hoping to get tickets the day of. Unfortunately, they were sold out 2-3 days in advance. Once you have your ticket, you will have to wait in a short line (much shorter than those trying to purchase) in order to pick it up. You have a certain time-frame where you are allowed into the gallery, I believe it is 2 hours. I really liked this so that it wasn't so crowded (like some of the other places we visited). The picture shows the walk up to the gallery. It was a beautiful place to spend the afternoon."

The gallery is in the enormous & beautiful Villa Borghese park with paths, trails, ponds, a zoo and is of interest for a day's outing. Stopping outside the entrance to the Galleria is a little train on wheels that will take you all about the park for about half an hour...very relaxing and scenic. It stops off at a scenic outlook over the city for passengers to take photos too. It was an inexpensive little ride, well worth the time and fun for everyone. This is a very nice outing and change from the bustle of the most touristic sights. You are not allowed to take any photos inside the Galleria."

It was quite a walk from our bus stop to get to the villa, and it turns out there's a 'train' that goes round the park that we didn't know about. Nobody could tell us its schedule or times though. I'm glad we made the effort to go (we found it difficult to access by public transport) but wasn't particularly impressed given its international status - the Villa Doria Pamphili was better, and better value, though the decoration of the Borghese salons is gorgeous.. Be warned - the timed entry means you only have 2 hours there before you get thrown out. It's enough, unless, like us, it takes you so long to find your way you're late!"

In the park is the Galleria Borghese which was where the Borghese family also got away from it all and kept their sculptures and artwork. I am not normally a museum or art person, but the Bernini statues were breathtaking as were some of the Caravaggio paintings. The ceilings were magnificent with some of the paintings looking three dimensional. Unfortunately, no photos are allowed.In January, the gallery was not crowded at all, and there are places to sit in each room so you can enjoy the surroundings. I would definitely recommend a visit."

It's a little further out from the other attractions, without many bus stops. We walked through Villa Borghese from the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo. So my lack of a pleasant experience may of been more self-inflicted vs what the museum offered. This was a highlight on the trip for my husband.

Ignore the complaints about getting to the museum, and getting tickets. Be smart, take a taxi, and buy your \"skip the line\" tickets thru ViaTour. A taxi from the forum area was $15. Why waste your time trying to figure out buses? After the museum, stroll through Villa Borghese park, and work your way to the Spanish Steps. Lovely views, nice park (lots to see) and it sure is wonderful to get off the city streets for a bit. We then took a taxi from the Spanish steps to Trastavere for lunch, two more musuems, and a church or two. A great itinerary for a day in Rome."

Wish I had known-- this would have helped me stay flexible and saved me 2 euros of online reservation service fee. I thought this museum was slightly overrated/overpriced-- sure, the centerpieces in each room (many by Bernini) were quite classic, and the gladiator mosaics in the center lobby was cool, but otherwise the collection were a bit repetitive... I tried to read the multilingual brochures in each room explaining the artwork, but perhaps I should have gotten an audio guide.

We had read about this Gallery in the Rick Steves Rome Book so we had an idea of what we would see and we reserved tickets in advance as recommended. They only allow a certain number of visitors each day and your visit is limited to 2 hours so you have to plan your visit in order to make sure you see the artwork you really want to see. (There were dozens of visitors that came up while we were there that had no reservations/tickets and they were all sent away.) It can be a little chaotic when you check in as you have to check bags (at a different desk than the one you get your tickets at) and if you want headsets with the guided audio tour (requires an additional charge), you have to go to a third desk. The staff at the museum were polite but not overly friendly so you have to pay attention and be proactive in asking questions to ensure you follow all of their rules. The Gallery is in the Villa Borghese Park so I suggest getting to the area early so you can stroll through the park or just people watch as it is a very interesting park with lots of history. The actual art collection is wonderful and it contains many pieces that most only hear about from a book or on TV. The only negative was that the museum brochure and audio tour list works by identification numbers that have either been changed or no longer exist (or are so obscured you cannot see them) so if you are too anal, you will lose time trying to find works of art that are out being restored/cleaned or that are no longer on display. I found I had to limit my time trying to find certain items to just a few seconds and then I moved on to the next work so I had sufficient time to take in the whole museum. I recommend this Gallery if you like legendary works of art that are a big part of history."

With the audio guide my son and I were able to listen to all the background info on the gallery and the artwork!It was stunning to see what Cardinal Borghese has put together some 380 years ago. Especially the Bernini sculptures took my attention as I have never seen anything comparable carved out of stone.Of all attractions in Rome this one left the deepest impression. A very special place to go!"

Our tour guide from Dark Rome through Viator travel, Rebecca was extraordinary. She made our experience unforgettable with her thorough knowledge and her genuine enthusiasm about her work. So do not go without a knowledgeable guide, unless you are an expert. You only are allowed a 2-hour stay in the villa as only a certain amount of people is allowed each time - and also pre-book the tickets. There are so many things to admire - and the walk through the gardens is a pleasure."

They are some of the most realistic depictions of the human form I've ever seen. Everything from the wrinkles in a couch to the veins on a man's hands is perfectly carved in marble.The gallery is a very nice and quiet. You have to make reservations in advance, so they limit the number of people inside at any time, which I think is great.The surrounding park is also quite beautiful and great for an afternoon stroll. At the end of the park there is a great view overlooking Piazza Popolo.If there is only one museum you visit in Rome, make it this one. Just be sure to book in advance because walk-ups are not allowed."

The Borghese Gallery is in what was originally called a \"casino\" or little house, built by Cardinal Scipione Borghese to house his ever growing collection of sculptures and paintings. It has some of the best sculptures by the great Gianlorenzo Bernini and paintings by Caravaggio, Titian, Cranach, and many others. The rooms alone are great art works themselves. Remember that you must book your tour beforehand, and it is easy to do online. Then you go an hour before your tour and collect your ticket. You are allowed 2 hours in the gallery, but it is enough time for most people. A definite MUST!"

Maybe I've seen too many wonderful collections during my time in Italy, but the art in the gallery was not the high point of my visit there. You have to have a reservation, which is easy to get on their website at this time of year. It is annoying that you have to check even small purses, which is not very common. There are some important pieces but they are fewer and farther between than other museums. The gardens, though, are lovely and a perfect stroll, weather permitting. Like Central Park in NYC, it is wonderful to have such a lovely garden setting in the middle of North Rome."

The villa was intended as a museum and a party place surrounded by a vast park and gardens. Visiting is strictly limited to two hours, no more, and advance reservations must be made. The sheer size of the collection is mind-boggling (until you get to the Vatican), so know what you want to see and map it out. For me, the highlight was Bernini's David, a far more active and accessible figure than Michelangelo's austere perfection. David's face is that concentrated grimace you see in discus throwers and Bernini's own perfection is in the spiral of the action.If you need bathrooms, you have to show your admission ticket."

Once inside, you are on the clock, and have to be out by a pre-set time... The staff was marginally friendly... Older people in our group had trouble with all the stairs and no one on the staff paid them any attention...Anyway, the art is certainly outstanding--though I can't draw up memories of any particular pieces approximately 60 days since we were there. Unless you do some manner of professional tour assist, consider taking the time to find the laminated collection description in each room to learn the basics of each piece.

The depth of the collection of Baroque & ancient art & sculpture in the glorious palazzo is dazzling & although it seems loosely enforced, the two-hour limit per visit, which sensibly prevents overcrowding, doesn't come close to being enough time to take it all in; so the next time we have the good fortune to be in Rome, we plan to visit at least twice..Reservations are required & accoustaguides are available, but since the narrative highlights only one painting per room on the third floor, you're on your own for the rest; so a more detailed guidebook available at the gift shop is recommended."

Please note that reservations are required and a group is admitted only every two hours.

I encountered some of the greatest sculpture by Bernini and oh my god they are just soooo beautiful! My personal favorite is \u201cApollo and Daphne\u201d, I think it\u2019s the best sculpture ever created on earth!!!The story about the Villa Borghese is actually interesting. There was a wealthy, powerful man named Scipione Borghese who has a great taste for art. He was later made a Cardinal by his uncle, Pope Paul V. So then he was not only rich and powerful, he was also an important man. He collected art from the great artists on the era (1600\u2032s) and decided to open the gallery for public to enjoy. I think this could be like the first art museum ever. The story of how he collected the art pieces is interesting. Some, he got it, um.. let\u2019s just say in an incorrect way.Cardinal Borghese also built the gallery itself with heart and soul. Every room of the gallery has its own theme and personality. I must say, the gallery has its reason to be exclusive. The gallery doesn\u2019t accept walk-in visitor. You must book a time slot and CAN\u2019T enter the gallery even 5 minutes before your slot begin. You only have maximum 2 hours inside the gallery. Bandi was swearing silently, why is the gallery so arrogant?! But then, it has every reason to be."

For Brits brought up on National Trust properties and for tourists used to mega-museums, the Borghese is a jewel of a treat!It's a small house (by the standards of stately homes, that is) which is filled to the gunn'ls with wonders. You can see lists easily enough of the contents but it was the sculptures that totally made my visit. Along with the Pantheon my abiding memory of Rome will always be the Bellini sculptures Rape of Persophone and that of Apollo and Daphne.If you leave aside the wonderful composition, visualisation and characterisation of both sculptures, the abiding shock comes from the simple question of how on earth it's possible to create this from STONE?? I have a very limited comprehension of working marble, but if you told me that it was a mix of butter and putty that later solidified, this would be a plausible explanation for the wonder in these two statues. I am now boring all my friends to death just repeating \"they're wonderful\" over and again.The house has other treats, don't get me wrong, but the Bellinis and the other sculptures really stole the show for me.Unlike many British stately homes there are no bedrooms, kitchens and other aspects of real life for the wealthy: the gallery was never in fact a home. Created solely for the purpose of housing this imperious art collection, it's as a result a compact, 100% art, visit.I reckon that you could \"do\" the gallery justice in 45 minutes, and the allotted 2 hour slot is plenty.Practical tip is to buy your tickets in advance, turn up 1 hour before to collect them and spend that time wandering the lovely grounds."

This collection is full of exquisite pieces set in exquisitely decorated rooms in the former home of the Borghese family. The audio guide provides plenty of good stories about how the art work was acquired through whatever means were necessary, including threats, extortion and outright robbery, by the nephew of the Pope at the time. He had great taste in art! The paintings are lovely, with some real gems, including some Titians and Caravaggios, but to me the real highlight is the floor of sculptures. Two of my favourites are both by Bernini: The Rape of Persepine, and Apollo and Daphne, where Daphne turns into a tree before your very eyes as Apollo is about to catch her and have his way with her. You literally can't believe that this sculpture can hold together, there is so much air in it. Pictures just can't compare with the experience of seeing it from 360 degrees.Too bad the staff is so unpleasant at this beautiful gallery. They act like the visitors are a nuisance, or worse, and are almost universally unhelpful. But go anyway; the beautiful art will take away all the sourness of the rules, regulations and surly workers.One word to the wise: book your tickets online ahead of time to avoid disappointment, but be really careful in choosing the date: the Italian calendar shows the week starting with Monday, not Sunday. I booked the wrong day at first and of course they would not let me change it or give a refund (in fairness this is clearly stated on the website numerous times); they also refused to just give my tickets to someone who could use them, which is a shame that they went to waste. So double-check your date carefully, and don't be late for your visit time, as you'll want to take advantage of every minute of your two hours!"

Compact and stuffed with treasures from ancient Roman sculpture and gruesome pictures of gladiators in the entrance hall to a treasure trove of Caravaggio upstairs: and this is what's left after a large chuck of the collection was sold to Napoleon (and is now to be seen in Paris).But you go here above all to see the breath-taking Bernini sculptures. All the greatest ones are subjects in tension or in metamorphosis or some life-crisis. So there is David tensioning his sling as he eyes up Goliath, about to fire; there is the sublimely beautiful, ethereally delicate execution of the moment when Daphne, being chased by Apollo, turns into a tree; and there is the Rape of Proserpina - daughter of Gaia - being hauled off to the underworld. You won't get in without planning: tickets are timed and you need to book on-line a couple of weeks ahead. But do it: and then rent a side-by-side bike to ride around the surrounding park!"

All a bit overwhelming at first glance. There are few Berninis remaiming inside but the key ones are well displayed. Not being allowed to photograph only means people use cell phones and Ipads and still interupt the flow so its a commercial decision. Buying tickets in advance is worthwhile but once in you only have 2 hours and are forced to climb 3 flights to start at the art collection which boasts some surprises like a great Cranack and a few other wonderful pieces but is generally pedestrian. Go for the decoration and the Berninis. Check out the back statue garden."

Ticket purchases are required in advance and are easy to do over the internet. Your visit will be a timed ticket, meaning you need to arrive on schedule and will have a limited period to visit, of 2 hours. As this is sold out almost every session, every day, there is not necessarily a best time to go to avoid the crowds. We chose to go on a Saturday afternoon between 5pm-7pm. We selected that time because it avoided the heat of the middle of the day, coincided with people heading off for dinner, so was a little less crowded, and was also towards the end of the day so the Borghese parklands were also less crowded. The gallery itself was very interesting. A couple of Bernini sculptures were my favourite items, Apollo & Daphne, and David. Both of these masterpieces are worth the admission alone, and I could have spent the whole time with just those two pieces.Unfortunately, there's no photography allowed in the gallery. However interestingly, when we hit the Louvre in Paris a month later, there was an amazing array of art from the Borghese on loan, with photos allowed!Also time your visit to take advantage of a stroll through the surrounding parklands as well. Allow a half day for the stroll and the visit for a leisurely trip.TIP: If you have a bag, it won't be allowed in. Make sure you get there a little early to collect your tickets and check your bag. As they are timed tickets, your session will all arrive together all with bags, all with tickets to collect. Getting there 10 minutes early worked very well for us. We were in while the pack was still queuing."

If I see one more iPad waggled aloft, I'll scream.What I loved about the Galleria Borghese is that you can get very close to the artwork, see it from all angles, and spend as long as you like in each room. (You'll never need all of the allocated time). You are not allowed to bring your phone or camera in, so people actually * look* at everything, for once. I loved that. Sadly, one of my favourite, lesser known works, has been moved, and damaged slightly. There's a bust of Borghese showing him in sacred dress, and one of the buttons of his soutane doesn't quite close, because he's too fat. It's a tiny detail, but I always liked it.The button is now grubby and there is a crack in the statue, but you can see what I mean if you look up an old photo of it.The gallery is not suitable for anyone with bad vertigo, as the only way up was 3 flights of a spiral staircase. The lift didn't seem to be in operation.(I occasionally suffer from balance problems, and I did feel a bit sick after the third floor).Part of the reason the Italians are slim, by the way, is that it is considered shameful to use the lift if one doesn't have to. They walk up and down stairs all day long. Some of the Americans I saw were disgracefully unfit.I'm not young (44) and I'm a UK size 18, but I had no problems walking anywhere in Rome. (Some of the writers on this site seem to think it's an obsacle course!).If you can't walk up a few flights of stairs without being out of breath, get in training before you come."

One of the first such purpose built structures, it houses a priceless collection of paintings and statuary, most notably some of Bernini's masterpieces like The Rape of the Sabines, Apollo and Daphne, and his exquisite David.

This purpose-built palace was built by Cardinal Scipione Borghese in the early 1600's. He wanted a place to showcase his art. This is such amazing collection that it's hard to believe an individual could have assembled it. Of course it helped that he was the nephew of the pope and had access to more money than god. Also he was not above having someone who didn't want to part with a particular piece, arrested until he decided maybe he would sell that sculpture after all. For me the \"Apollo and Daphne\" is the most amazing piece there. Even after looking at sculpture all over Rome, it still stands out. You absolutely need to make a reservation to come here. It's easy....just call them up and schedule a time. They give you a number. When you arrive - if you're not using the Roma pass - then just buy your ticket. If you want to get the audio guide (I recommend it), then you have to wait in another line. You only have 2 hours in the museum -- no more! So I recommend you get there about 30-45 minutes early in order to get your tickets and audio guide and be ready to go. It's enough time to see most everything, but you don't want to be rushed because you got there late."

Size of groups are limited to 360 people that is great idea because the place is not huge and gets crowded very quickly. You can have guided tour, audio guide, or just go and read information in every room that is provided. The Gallery is absolutely beautiful: not just a collection of art that is displayed, but also the building itself. Every room is unique and beautiful from floor to ceiling! We loved it. We came to park of Villa Borghese from Piazza del Popolo and walked through the park for a few hours. The garden near villa Borghese is not as beautiful as gardens in France or England, not that many flowers, and not as groomed. There are a few places to eat and bathrooms in a park and also cafeteria and bathrooms in lower level of the gallery building.To summarize: we absolutely loved the Gallery and would highly recommend it.

The variety kept our whole party engaged and we visited in the off season, so it wasn't very crowded. My favorite part of the entire Galleria was the large marble sculpture of Pluto and Proserpina by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. I could have studied it for hours with the countless amount of detail in the sculpt. Pluto has veins and muscle detail as I'd never seen, whereas the lack of muscle definition in Proserpina juxtaposed her feminine form with Pluto's masculinity. Where Pluto's hand holds tightly to her thigh, there are beautiful indications in the marble, just as there would be with skin. It is by far the most incredible statue I have ever seen and was the highlight of the entire gallery. I could go on and on about the genius in detailing. This museum is not to be missed. Be sure to reserve tickets ahead of time, as they sell out quickly. When leaving, be sure to take a walk through the adjacent park, which holds little treasures all of its own."

I think it has a lot to do with the crowd control: limiting the number of people in the museum at any one time is a terrific idea! No mad crush of people like in the Vatican. And it's small and intimate, unlike the Vatican (not to knock the Vatican!) I was bowled over by the Bernini sculptures, and glad to find I could get close and walk around them to see them from all angles (the area around \"David\" was being worked on so we couldn't walk around it). The gallery itself is so beautiful -- with frescoes everywhere -- and that really added to my enjoyment of the artwork. I got the audio guide and thought it was wonderful. I am so glad I went! It is well worth the small effort you must make ahead of time for reservations. FYI, some people in line told us they had gotten their reservations that day; they called over and over and were told no each time, then suddenly there was an opening. So keep trying if you're desperate! A note of caution: don't start your visit on the lower level, where they check your bags, give out tickets, and sell the audio guides, unless you're prepared to climb at least 50-60 stairs!

Make reservations at least several days before hand and show up/check your all bags (& cameras) at least 30 minutes before your scheduled start time to avoid the line. Budget your time, as the 2 hour limit is strictly enforced. This is a physically small museum, but contains many interesting works. Consider heading upstairs to the paintings first, then back down to the sculptures, as this will mean less crowded spaces (the reservations/time limit already helps in this regard). We spent the rest of the day in the Villa Borghese (park) walking, riding the tram and having lunch near the cinema. We visited the park & gallery on All Saints Day (Nov 1 - a national holiday). The park was filled with people, but not crowded. A great experience."

I contacted the proper authorities immediately (police and security at the museum), went to the embassy to replace my passport and cancel my credit cards, and turned all the information over to the museum. The one person who bothered to contact me indicated the CEO (no name) would consider my claim and get back to me. It has now been 11 months and I have heard nothing. A reputable museum of the caliber of the Villa Borghese should have decent security and it doesn't. Since you can't take anything with you into the museum and there are no locked lockers, belongings are up for grabs apparently. I loved the art but will never go back. I suggest you think twice about going there unless your hands are empty!"

After you check in, you get your tickets and you have to check ALL of your BAGS. This really bothered me, but you have no choice. The museum is housed in a small palace, and each room is very well put together. The frescos on the walls and ceilings of each room rival the sculptures and paintings decorating it. There is a mix of tour groups and individuals. While I enjoyed the museum, it is only two small floors of art work, and I was really surprised. I feel like for making reservations and paying for it (we used our Roma pass) that there should have been more."

Sometimes it pays to arrive early, pick up your ticket and then ask at what looks to be the entrance if you are not sure exactly where to enter.We ordered our tickets on the internet and the pickup was seemless. When we arrived there was a sign stating no available reservations for the next four days.

Bernini\u2019s detail in his sculpting is absolutely unbelievable. The museum is rather small being the former residence of a cardinal in the church who had a voracious appetite for fine art, but is packed is beautiful items. The building\u2019s interior itself had been refreshed & the degree of detail & level of colors was almost as impressive as the art work itself.Reservations are a must & the museum personnel are diligent in maintaining the number of people allowed in the museum & the length of time. Thy give you a maximum of 2 hours, but with the use of the audio guides, you can see all of the art in about an hour & a half.The gallery is located in the Villa Borghese park so make sure you go to the Borghese Gallery & not just the park.

I have a very bad back so stairs are difficult, we climbed the stairs to the entrance on out allotted day and time to be told, brusquely, that we had to leave our bags and cameras downstairs. My other half went and joined the queue to do just that only to return ten minutes later because he had to have the tickets (which I still had) to check in our bags! Back to the queue. It would have been helpful if there had been something to tell us when we booked, or when we tried to go in. So ewe finally get in, and yes, there are some wonderful sculptures and paintings, but quite frankly we'd been to the Vatican and several museums before we got here and the things here were no more interesting (to me, anyway) and we were allowed to take photos in all the other place (except the Sistine Chapel which is fair enough). So yes, a lovely building containing some lovely works of art but with unfriendly and unhelpful staff."

Buy your tickets online, show up at the appropriate time and you'll have two hours to wallow in all this spectacular art and history. It's best to head to the top floor when you enter. You'll have a little more elbow room as you work your way through the galleries. That is also where you'll find the majority of the paintings. The sculptures are on the lower floors.We were fortunate to have the whole room to ourselves as we admired Titian's \"Sacred and Profane Love\" . There is so much more detail in the painting that just doesn't show up in reproductions.The real highlight of the Borghese is all the sculpture by Bernini. \"Apollo and Daphne\" is a virtuoso performance in marble. It depicts Apollo trying to hold on to Daphne while she is turning into a tree. (Research the story for details.) How on earth did he carve all these delicate leaves and slender branches out of one piece of marble?There are a lot of those \"How On Earth\" moments. Some of the most spectacular sculpture in the world is there at The Borghese.Don't miss this!BTW - There is a nice cafe downstairs where you check your bags. You can grab breakfast or lunch there if you like. And be sure to allow some time to stroll through the park. It is absolutely beautiful."

It's just lovely and very manageable (not too big, nor will you get lost). Plus, you can get up-close to the art. Full of amazing and usual art... much of which was/is considered controversial for it's time.The collection was all owned by one man, the nephew of a pope! The setting is the Palace/Villa of the Borghese family situated in the serene Borghese Gardens. This is one the world's great public parks. There are food carts/stands and restaurants nearby so plan to have a picnic in the gardens (many benches) or at one of the nearby cafes. The Galleria Borghese also has a cafe in the basement. I recommend you plan on travel time to get there as it's in the North end of the city, but if you're up for a walk, it is a lovely setting and beautiful part of Rome. Anyone w/mobility issues should probably take a taxi there.We downloaded Rick Steve's FREE smartphone APP and used that as our guide instead of renting the audio guides at the desk. You can also get into the Galleria Borghese if you buy the ROME CARD and use it during the time it's good for up to three of Rome's major attractions during a three-day period. You will need to call once you're in Rome (we had our hotel concierge do that for us) for reservations to get in as only a couple hundred people go through the Galleria Borghese every couple of hours. We got our ROME CARD at the Termini Train Station for 35 Euros and used it to get into the Colleseum and the Forum in addition to the Galleria Borghese (saves money for the gelato you'll want to enjoy later!).Tip: Enter from the basement (don't go up the stairs, as that is the exit). You need to go downstairs to enter. You check-in for your tickets to the right and the coat/bag ck is to your left."

Don't go in the galleria from there. Come back outside and climb the side stairs that will take you to the main entrance. This gallery was meant to impress and it certainly does that when you come in the front entrance. Spend lots of time watching the Bernini sculptures. They all tell a story. It's a good idea to read about them beforehand or take a travel book with you. I had the Rick Steves one and it tells you the story behind each statue. I'm sure you can read about them online too. It makes a world of difference!! My favorite one is the Apollo and Daphne statue. This statue is meant to be seen from the back at first and slowly circle it to your right all the way around. It is amazing to me how Bernini told a whole story with one statue. The only sad part is that you can't take pictures inside. After your visit take a stroll in the park. We walked the length of it all the way to Piazza del Popolo."

You can book them online, but you must pay full price. We opted to make the reservation via phone (my husband speaks Italian, which really helped), and purchased the entry tickets onsite using our Roma passes. The Roma Pass gives you free entry to two museums and unlimited use of public transportation in town. We used the pass for the Galleria and the Colosseum. Another important point - we got to skip the lines. The Colosseum has its own line for Roma Pass, and we thought it worth the price just to breeze past everyone waiting in that 2-hour line."

There aren't enough audio guides to get them much before your tour begins as the previous tour is still using them. You must leave a photo ID to get a guide and each audio guide cost 5 Euro."

In particular, in particular, it features some of Bernini's best sculptures and some excellenct paintings by Caravaggio. In addition to art on display, the rooms are exquisitely decorated. It is on par with much of the Vatican Museums, however it is a smaller and more manageable visit and because visitor numbers are strictly limited, one is much freer to enjoy the art. Things to know: - You must book in advance. Be there 15-20 minutes in advance to pick up your tickets and check your bags.-You must check your bags. -The audioguide is very good."

You most pre-order your tickets on line , depending on the season weeks ahead of time. There are private guides that offer to take your around with extensive explainations of the art works. However you can rent headphones with recordings of most of the more important pieces that were very good and easily understood( which is what we did). Some of these private guides also offer to take you around the grounds but I don't think it is necessary the grounds are free to to walk around and they are beautiful but nothing or special that it would make it worth paying extra money for. Now that has all been explained I'd like to say that I live in Manhattan and have been to most of the museums here. I've also been to the the Vatican, Sistine Chapel, the Louve in Paris and many other museums throughout Europe. Now, the works of art especially the sculptures of Bernidini really took my breath away (not too many have done this through all my travels) there is just a wonderful collection there, more then I've seen anywhere. The fact that they are presented in this beautiful mansion, just adds to the ambiance. The history of the mansion is explained as well as the owners reason for his exstremely expensive purchases of all the art works. By all means make this a have to on your list of things to in while in Roma."

The second is figure what's the best way to get there, cause it can be a little tricky. I decided to take the subway to Piazza di Spagna and walk the rest of the way. It's a short walk, but it can be confusing and you may think you're on the wrong track. That's because the Galleria stands in a magnificent park that also hosts the zoo, a horse riding school, an outdoors movie theater, among other amazing things. The walk through the park is already a treat in itself, since it has amazing sculptures, fountains, and mock temples all over it. It's a place to explore and enjoy in a sunny morning.Once you get to the Galleria, you'll see that the building is also a jewel and its gardens are magnificent. But the best is yet to come.I love that they have the small groups booked. That allows you to find your own pace and not be where everyone else is at the same time. So you can enjoy your favorite works at leissure. At first, I thought 2 hours was appalling and that I would need much more to see the whole thing, but it's plenty. Be warned that it's strictly forbidden to enter the museum holding bags, umbrellas, cameras or mobiles. You must leave your things at a cloakroom, and it's a good thing it's free. I strongly recommend taking and audio guide for this. It's so worth it, with real interesting and relevant information. To me, the first floor or the statuary is the best part. Seeing Bernini's sculptures really brought me to tears. They are so amazing and larger than life. And the best thing is that you can walk all around them and see them at all angles and look at each tiny detail. The second floor holds only paintings and also has some amazing works, like some Caravaggio's, Raphael's,Titan's and other easily recognizable pictures. But I have to confess that I hurried here a bit, so I could go down again and take a longer look at Daphne and Apollo, Prosephine and David. On your way out, be sure to visit the bookshop. They have some great books (I got myself 5) and prints. It's hard to resist.Then, you can go explore the park some more. It's really something and one of my favorite places in Rome."

It is certainly worth visiting the Galleria Borghese on account of Bernini's superb sculpture \"The Rape of Proserpine\" which is splendidly positioned in the middle of a large room enabling the visitor to view it from all angles. Be advised you are not allowed to take photos and all cameras and bags must be left at the designated area in the foyer before entering the museum. My recommendation would be to start at the top of the building and work your way down, as, due to visits being timed in 2-hour slots, there was a general scrum in the rooms immediately after the entrance as everyone for a particular time slot was let in at once. Upstairs you have the (in my opinion) aforementioned largely dull and repetitive religious-themed art - can't remember any one particular thing - but on the ground floor are the sculptures that make the visit worthwhile, including a representation of a reclining Pauline Bonaparte (Napoleon's sister). Personally I don't think you need the full two hours and of course it is expensive (about 11/12 euros) and tickets need to be booked in advance either online or by telephone."

I truly enjoyed my visit alone the first trip, but I was excited to share the museum with my parents and children on the second visit. It believe it is a must see. We stayed at an apartment by the Spanish steps and it took about 30 minutes to walk up the hill and get to the Villa. My girls enjoyed a buggy ride after a 2-hour visit, and we had a great time zipping around the pathways in the large park. Sometimes large public events are held at the park surrounding the Villa, and I did catch a World Cup soccer game on an enormous screen with a few thousand fans watching. That was definitely a immersion in culture! There is a wonderful overlook of the Piazza di Popolo where you can take a great photo of the whole city. Also a must-do."

For me, knowing something about the artists and their places in history add to the experience. So I would suggest reading a popular art history book if you really want the full experience. I read \"Rome: A Cultural, Visual, and Personal History\" by Robert Hughes. Some parts I found a little slow, but I was glad for the knowledge.Bags are not allowed, but there is a bag check. I think that it was free. Enter in the middle of the front of the building, going down the stairs for tickets and bag check. After that, you go up the stairs to enter the gallery. Audioguides available, and I personally can't do without them.After enjoying the gallery, the Piazza del Popolo is a pleasant 1.9 km walk through the gardens away.

Got to the room where audio tour was to begin and headset did not work. Staff was not visible. Walked halfway down and met some official who did not seem to think he could do anything (like go get another headset). Friend and I deceided to share. Not too long after, official turned up with new headset. After that, all went well and we were dazzled by the art and history. We were there at Easter and could not find a restaurant open for lunch. Toilets were not the cleanest."

This museum limits the number of guests per hour, so it is not as crowded and you can walk at a quick pace and stop only when you feel like stopping to see something. My cousin decided to book a tour guide for the museum. Little did he know, and little did the guide tell him, that if you are more than 5 people, a guide is not permitted to discuss out loud any of the art, so you are required to then spend more money to rent the headphone devices. I hate those things and can read what is written on the wall next to each and every painting (amazing how curators have thought of this), so I took my 2 children and niece and nephew with me so that we would be 5 and the others could get the tour. You definitely do not need more than 1 hour in here. 45 minutes tops and that should include a bathroom stop because it is clean. Nice to see, just plan on a quick visit. My cousin also made us meet the guide an hour before the museum even opened, so we were forced to wait there for 1 hour before gaining access. It was especially fun for the 4 kids, ages 9-5, to wait on the steps for an hour. It opens at 11 am. Each ticket gives you 2 hours access."

            "review": "Second Favorite Stop in Rome. A friend and I, both of us 30 (w/ rather diverse interests I might add) decided to add this to our itinerary for Rome. So glad we did! After Le Domus Romane di Palazzo Valentini this was our favorite. The museum houses a large collection of Bernini statues and Caravaggio paintings and every room is more captivating than the last. A woman on the plane recommended the audio tour over the actual guide and we took her advice. I can't speak to how it would have been versus a real person, but I really enjoyed it. It was one of those go-at-your-own-pace, plug in the number of the statue when you get there type audio guides. As others have mentioned you have exactly 2 hours inside the museum and you need to get there 30 minutes before. TIP: the room you start in if you come up the staircase from behind the audio-rental desk is the back of the museum, NOT the front. The hardest part was figuring out what room on the map you're in to start plugging in numbers. It was a central rectangular room that had three separate audio tags...best of luck :-) We used the Roma Pass and had this earmarked as one of our free entrance fees. I emailed them to confirm our 2pm reservation and they replied w/ a confirmation number. When we arrived, I presented the ticket desk w/ both my initial email and the reply...they had no record of it. But seeing as I had the email and they were sold out for the next few days, they gave us tickets anyway (we were pretty nervous there for a minute). After your ticket, you have to check everything...remember to keep your ID on you and some $$ so you can rent your audio guide. Then you que up until they let you go in. It's a huge hassle, but worth it. Take some time to explore the gardens afterward, they're great."

We booked on the website: http://www.galleriaborghese.it/borghese/en/edefault.htm which takes you through to a secure booking site: http://www.tosc.it/tickets.htm?affiliate=T2C&sort_by=event_datum&sort_direction=asc&fun=erdetail&doc=erdetaila&erid=912678&language=enThe Gallery is spectacular and breath-taking, and the information on the audio guide interesting, educational and extremely helpful (and necessary in my opinion; I think your experience would be diminished without an audio guide). Whilst you pay for reservations online, you will buy the inexpensive audio guides separately on the day. I think even if you\u2019re not an art lover, you\u2019ll be impressed by the rich artwork and will appreciate the related historical value.Be careful as to which metro station you get off at to access the gallery! We got off at Flaminio and it was a 25mins walk (through a nice green parkland though) to get to the Borghese Gallery. I think it would have been faster/closer to go to Spagna (and that is where we went on our way back to the hotel). If you are comfortable with the buses then without doubt that is the option that takes you closest to the gallery itself.Another point to note is that you have to check in your bag so make sure you leave enough time for this. There wasn\u2019t much of a queue for us, but maybe that\u2019s because it was the last entry slot of the day so was less busy."

The Galleria itself is majestic and located in the expansive Villa Borghese gardens. You have to reserve a 2 hour viewing slot online before hand and get there 15 mins ahead of time to pick up your tickets. They allow only a limited number of people in at a time so the slots get filled up pretty quickly so plan ahead. Moreover they are sticklers for adherence to the 2 hour slot so if you are not done with the gallery within the allotted time then tough luck, you will be politely told to exit out. They literally start closing off doors to the various sections one by one. We missed seeing about 20% of the top-most floor due to running out of time. Main reason was that we had gotten the audio guide and were spending a lot of time in front of exhibits listening to the audio. One recommendation is to skip the audio for the exhibits that you are really not interested in and move on to the next one in the room.Once you are done with the galleria make sure that you visit the gardens they are quite beautiful. My wife and I rented a two seater - 4 wheel bicycle and rode around the gardens (they are quite huge) which was a lot of fun. There are a couple of locations in the gardens to rent the bikes, the closest to the galleria is to walk straight down the road in front of the galleria (with your back to it) for about 200 feet and you will see the bike rental place on your right.Remember you will need at least 4 hours to do all this so plan accordingly. Overall highly recommended for art lovers."

However, I'm sad to report that the hours spent in this museum were our least favorite hours in Rome! Perhaps it was due to our having a self-guided tour (we rented an audio tour at the museum) wedged between two professionally-guided tours of the Vatican and Colosseum. Yes, the grounds were beautiful and EVERYTHING in Rome is pure work of Art, but give yourself permission (if you feel so inclined) to spend your time where your heart leads.....reviews on the Internet won't always be correct for you."

Much of the work was commissioned by the family, not just acquired. The Bernini sculptures are worth the visit on their own and it is amazing how accessible they are to visitors. This allows you stand right next to his works and really see up close the amazing detail. To see a hand gripping a thigh with indentations similar to someone grabbing a plump loaf of uncooked bread (sorry, best example I can give) and realize that it is marble takes your breath away. I'm not a big fan of renaissance painting, but the sculpture is stunning. Definitely take the audio tour or use a guide and read up on the gallery before visiting."

Get the audioguide and just relax and see some of the most impressive sculptures and paintings ever done. The Pope made his nephew the Cardinal and did he ever made the best of that! Loved it.

You start out by going back out the door you just came into to start the tour. See the first floor, then back out the \"front\" door to go back in side to see the painting section.

In most rooms there is only one narrative to listen to per room.The museum is in a nice building in a beautiful setting, but I've seen much better organization at county fairs.

I've never seen such beautiful, awesome sculptures other than in the Louvre. It is so popular that you have to purchase tickets ahead of time for a specific block of time - only 2 hours and you'll be hard pressed to get thru the entire museum in that short of time. As we got there a bit late, we spent our time in the sculpture wing and just had time to dash thru the painting wing.....too bad! Will definitely return and get there early so we don't miss out on anything. A real must see while in Rome!!"

Sure, it doesn't have the (unmanageable) quantity of treasures that the Vatican Museums has, but the quality of its collection is no less impressive. Beyond the paintings and sculptures, the villa itself is a work of art. Combine that with the tranquil setting of the surrounding gardens and you have a much more relaxing day than standing in line at the Vatican. Don't get me wrong: the Vatican museums should not be missed. But as an overall experience, I have always preferred visiting Galleria Borghese."

The collection of art held within is sublime, it really does house some of the most amazing art in Rome. If going, don't catch the Metro, as the signage from the station is confusing and ends halfway to the Villa. There are several bus routes that serve the area, which are quick and easy to use. Taxis are an option, as are segways (we saw a family arrive on one while we leaving).The two hour limit on the visit is a perfect amount of time to see everything, so don't let that put you off. It is highly recommended that you pre-purchase your tickets as purchasing them on the day is fraught as they sell out quickly."

It's also a nice, peaceful experience. Unlike the vatican which has not limit to the amount of visitors, the Borghese limits the amount of tickets they sell each day. This gives you a civilized experience and you can enjoy the art without a million people in front of you taking pictures of paintings without really looking at them. I had to create an account on the italian ticket site to buy the tickets but it really wasn't that difficult. The one thing I would say is, the Borghese is not in central Rome really. We managed to take a taxi from our hotel in Vatican Prati and it was 10 euro. Make sure you get them to call you a taxi back if you do this. We wandered aimlessly around the park trying to figure out how to get back and there wasn't a taxi in sight."

O.k., so, we went to our tour (which we booked in advance - a must - or you won't get in because space is so limited) after we had just come out of that swirling vortex of tourist Hell, also known as Vatican City, O.M.G., what a difference! Fist of all, my apologies to the Vatican, but they really need to take a page from Galleria Borghese. The Vatican seems to allow in an unlimited number of people at all times which leads to utter chaos & crowds. We felt like we were amidst an angry mob! Not easy to take in what we came there to experience in the first place. At Galleria Borghese they only allow in 200 people at a time, in very small groups, led by EXCELLENT, well educated guides. I think they could see that we had been put through the ringer that morning, so our most awesome guide ever, Rebecca, took our little group up to the top floor while the other groups were on the bottom floor. She managed to maneuver our group in such a way that we were never in the same room as another group at the same time, WONDERFUL! (Our guide at the Vatican told us to be aggressive if we wanted to be able to see anything!) One thing that initially bummed me out was that your not allowed to bring your camera in & take pictures. My baby, I mean camera, was safely locked away during the tour, which was like going through withdrawals for me! Very quickly though, I realized that I was more present & more able to really listen & take in what Awesome Rebecca (yes, that will be her name from now on) was saying. The gallery is so beautiful & to learn all about Correggio, Titian & in particular Bernini, from someone who is SO passionate about it was a real treat. We all felt so much better (& smarter!) after having been there & slowed our pace down enough to \"stop & smell the roses\", or in this case really see, listen & learn, rather than just trying to dodge mobs of tired, irritated & sometimes entitled tourists & their \"be aggressive\" guides. So, go and spend a few hours in the gardens, have a picnic & then visit the gallery. It's so beautiful & a wonderful way to spend part of a day. You'll be glad you did! And you'll be shockingly smarter too!"

The galleria sits in a large area that also has gardens/parks and historic adjacent buildings. I highly recommend that anyone visiting this location get advance tickets before visiting to avoid the lines which we did and were able to walk right in at our scheduled time. One item to not overlook while appreciating the artwork and statues is to view the incredible ceiling artwork. I was equally astounding by the painted ceiling as everything else in the galleria.

We had reservations for 17:00 and because of transportation issues not related to the Galleria, we were more than 30 minutes late and were afraid we'd be turned away. Nope. Not a word about it, walked right in and never thought about it again. Bring as little with you as you can. Purses, bags, phones, essentially everything must be checked in a locker before entering."

The artwork collection is considerable, and well worth seeing. Set in the huge and amazing grounds with sculptures, fountains, huge trees you will have a good day out by taking a picnic lunch to have first or a wander around after going to to the Galleria.Important: This place gets really busy during the high season so you may have to book tickets at least several days in advance online as we did for our session. The collection queue may be short, but allow ample time before your session to queue up on the day."

The booking website says it's open until 7:30 but I returned from the garden at 7:15 and it was locked like Fort Knox. It means if you get in at 5:00, you don't have 2 hours, you have to leave 10-15 minutes earlier to get your stuff back. As I already mentioned, no one cared to warn me about this and my stuff got locked there until next morning, which was supposed for visiting Vatican museums. I had to go there next morning( BTW their flyer said that bus 119 goes there but actually it doesn't), lost a lot of precious time and because of that I had to pay \u20ac27.5 to skip the line at Vatican museum.P.S.

There were quite a few people turned away at the door of the gallery and told to check in their bags. I am an art history student so had a bit of background knowledge to the sculptures and paintings, and as my husband and I like to stop and discuss what we're looking at, decided not to hire the audio guides. However, if you do not know about the exhibits, I would recommend getting the guides as the description panels are few and far between.

If you could just go and pay to get in - no big deal - but, they do this horrible thing that you have to buy tickets ahead of time - and then go wait in line to get them. We had to wait over 45 minutes in a line - in the very hot August sun - just to get in - and they had ONE person giving out tickets!! It was a horrible experience and just not worth it. If you are an art fan - then of course you do not want to miss this - but, the only way to go is a private tour - because then you get to skip the lines!!! Another tip - get there at least an hour before your scheduled time. Our time frame was from 11 am to 1 pm. We got there at 10:30 - and so did everyone else it seemed. We did not get in until after 11:15 am. And the place was so crowded - that we were in and out in about 45 minutes. But, i noticed as I was leaving - that the line was down dramatically at Noon. So, get there at least an hour before your scheduled time - and get your tickets and walk around the park for an hour and then you can just walk right in."

As I have no background in such art history but have a great appreciation for it, I enjoyed looking at the way each art piece differed in relation to their era. We were able to experience a great moment as well as a blind man was allowed to run his hands over the Pauline Bonaparte-Borghese sculpture.

In retrospect, one thing I liked about this place (in addition to the excellent art) is that it was a much easier experience than visiting other popular tourist sites. Entry is organised into two hour slots and this ensures that the place is not overfilled with visitors. Also, you are not allowed to take pictures inside. You can go here and really appreciate and absorb the experience without having people falling over themselves to take millions of pictures. Compare this to my experience at the Vatican museum which was horrendous. Overcrowded with thousands of tourists, you can barely move one way or the other and it is basically unbearable when combined with the heat factor. To ensure at least one stress-free tourist experience where you can really enjoy ancient Roman art then this place is a must."

Each visit is scheduled for 2 hours. We had tickets from 13.00 to 15.00. So, imagine or surprise when we arrived to find a huge queue that took 30 minutes to clear and which meant we were left with only 1\u00bd hours. The organisation was absolutely dreadful. It was by chance we discovered there was a second counter where tickets could be purchased (even though a notice told us this was not possible). Our disappointment continued because, once inside, there were no information panels identifying the various sculptures and busts of Emperors. In fact, there was a paucity of information for most of the exhibits, apart form the paintings, where a small panel identifying the artist and the work was set adjacent to each painting. Had we known this was the case, we would have rented an audio guide. But there was no sign saying that this was essential (which it clearly was).The result was that the youngest member of our group, aged 9, felt that the experience was boring, although she liked some of the sculptures. She found that not knowing who the busts represented was very frustrating, as she is learning about ancient Rome at School.If you are considering a visit to this museum, my advice is to (a) book online for tickets. Make sure you check one or two sites. The English speaking site we found wanted to charge more than double what we paid by booking through an Italian site (http://www.ticketone.it/)(b) get there about 30 minutes before the due time slot, as you should anticipate both queues and slow progress(c) take an audio guide."

My experience initially with the ticket staff was undoubtedly the poorest I have ever experienced. I went to the gallery on a Tuesday to book for the Thursday. Upon arrival I noticed a sign that said Wednesday was full so I asked about any time slots available for Thursday. I was asked abruptly if I had rung, to which I replied 'no'. I was then told to 'get out' and go back to my hotel and ring for a reservation and then return. In attempting to explain that the hotel was someway away and that I did not have a cell phone on me all I was met with was a barrage of loud 'get out, get out' and not pleasant hand gesture waving. Without a doubt this woman is the rudest person in Rome that I met! I did book by phone and went on the Saturday. While lining up the young man on the ticket desk informed the people in front of me that despite having no tickets for 3pm if they waited around there was the possibility that they could still get in. I would love to know why I was treated so poorly compared to these other people.Although the gallery is well rated the paintings are not a patch on the quality of the sculptures which were of the highest standard. The audio guide at 5 euro only covers relatively few of the paintings but tends to describe the sculptures in great depth. If you are looking for paintings the Vatican Museum has a better array and quality along with many of the churches. What makes the value of the trip are the quality statues. You are not permitted to take photographs but the shop has some very good and comparatively inexpensive books including a guide book which compensate for the inability to take photos. The gallery is very good, without being exceptional, especially the paintings when compared with what was available in Paris. The opportunity to relax in the park area was great and the rickshaw bikes (12 euro for a three seater for an hour) were a great way to tour around and have family fun. The rickshaw bikes do not require as much energy as you might think and once moving are more difficult to slow down than anything. Also available were segway, golf carts and bikes. Given the size of the park and the lack of time that people generally have it is a great way to explore the area."

Also, the grounds themselves are as beautiful as the artwork inside. We took a little mini-train ride tour for about 3 or 4 euros each. Bikes, for 1-4 people, rent by the hour as well. If we had allowed more time at this wonderful site, we would have toured the grounds on bikes."

Reserve tickets online, but still be prepared for long lines. And if it's summer, be prepared to sweat while you are waiting in a massive crowd. The museum itself was for me a cross between the formality of a major museum like the New York MET and the more intimate collection of an astute collector like the Gardner Museum in Boston. The grandeur of the place is undeniable. Your feet feel it walking across all those amazing marble floors. But it also has the intimacy of personal preference. Borghese especially enjoyed Bernini and commissioned many fine sculptures\u2014one set devoted to an entire room. Bernini's David is an absolutely incredible dramatic foil to Michelangelo's calm masterpiece in Florence. Borghese also collected works of Caravagio and a huge number of sculptures from antiquity. Rome's history is always overwhelming. It is so in this gallery, but you cover a lot in two floors! Also, the gardens surrounding the Villa make a very peaceful break from the traffic noise of Rome."

We had booked the Galleria for Saturday, after visiting the Vatican Museums on the Friday. the Vatican was slightly disappointing; not the art itself, but rather the crowds (pushing you towards the Sistine Chapel like you're on a conveyor belt). So this was a refreshing change. They only allow 300 people in at any one time, so it wasn't at all crowded, and there was plenty of space to really appreciate the art. No one review can highlight the masterpieces in this gallery, and I'm not going to try. There's just too many to list. Most reviewers will highlight the amazing sculptures, particularly Bernini's works: Apollo and Daphne (the most amazing sculpture I've ever seen), David, and Pluto & Prosperina to name but three out of hundreds of masterpieces. The paintings are just as amazing, however, and I enjoyed these just as much. Bassano's Last Supper, Carravagio's David with the Head of Goliath, and Raphael's Deposition particularly stayed in my head, although again there are hundreds of paintings that warrant as much of a mention. And, don't forget the artwork of the rooms themselves - they could sell tickets to see the empty rooms alone and I'd still pay. You absolutely need to book in advance, particularly in Summer. When we arrived on a Saturday, tickets were sold out until Tuesday. (And when we booked a month in advance, we had tickets 89-90 out of 300!). This may seem silly at first, but it's fantastic when you do get in, because it's never overcrowded and you have plenty of space and time to enjoy the art (we found 2 hours to be sufficient, although I'm sure some art fans could spend all day in this treasure trove). And, do be aware, you have to check pretty much everything (bags, cameras, phones...) at the door, so arrive in plenty of time. And afterwards, have a stroll in the Villa Borghese - the most beautiful park in Rome. Quiet, serene, and totally withdrawn from the bustle of the city, whilst still retaining a distinctive Roman feel.An absolute highlight of my trip, and a must for any serious art lover."

I prefer Bernini's David to Michelangelo's -- the determined expression and pose that catches David in action are not to be missed. And of course Bernini's Daphne and Apollo is the most amazing sculpture. It must be seen 360 degrees. It's a sculpture in motion, from the wind in Daphne's hair to the form of each leaf. Our grandchildren surprised us by being fascinated by the quality of the ceiling frescoes as well as the sculpture and ancient Roman mosaics. Visitors may not notice that the art is arranged thematically. The David, for example, is in a room with many sculptures depicting the labors of Hercules.We did not feel like cattle in a stampede. A fixed number of visitors are allowed in every two hours (by reservation), nothing like the crowds at the Vatican. When we visited in June, the opening time was delayed because of a union meeting. People with reservations for 9:00 and 11:00 waited until noon to enter, but we still didn't feel crushed in a crowd. Yes, you must reserve in advance (easy online), and there is no mercy if you fail to show up for your reserved time or try to change your reservation. When the museum closed unexpectedly, however, there were no apologies for us. They did, however, let everyone in regardless of their reserved time. After visiting the museum, enjoy walking around the gardens, or make your way down Via Veneto to the \"Bones Church,\" the Capuchin Crypt. It is very different and well worth a visit."

We never went before because we were never organized enough to call ahead to make reservations, but this time, as soon as we got to Rome, we asked our concierge to make a reservation for us. He warned us that it is usually booked for a week but he would see what he could do. He was able to get us in in the next two days. When we got there, a sign said that it was sold out for several days and several people left disappointed. I would suggest you have your hotel call like we did; they seem to have an \"in\" with reservations. The art was fabulous. Afterwards we made the short walk to the Rome Zoo, which was also very enjoyable."

My favorites were 1) Canova\u2019s Venus Victrix (rumored to be Bonaparte\u2019s sister) look at the sculpted cushion and pose, 2) Bernini\u2019s David detailed angst in face and his twisted body, 3) Bernini\u2019s famed Apollo and Daphne with lifelike facial features and a feeling of movement from the couple (as well as surprisingly thinly sculpted leaves), and 4) Bernini\u2019s Rape of Prosperena with his hand realistically grasping her thigh. I loved having the audioguide for the sculptures. Be sure to keep moving to the upstairs picture galleries as well; art lovers WILL run out of time and be escorted the door after 2 hours."

Tucked away in the lovely Borghese Gardens, this museum features a great collection of paintings and sculptures for the art lover. If you are a fan of Bernini's work, you must visit, even if it's just to see his \"Apollo and Diane.\" You get a two-hour block of time with your reservation, which is ample time to see all of the artwork. It's not overly crowded, which is a nice contrast to most of the popular galleries. There is a cafe near the entrance as well. I recommend that anyone who appreciates art enjoy this hidden gem."

The Galleria Borghese is not a very large gallery but as it was the home of Scipione Borghese it represents an almost unique opportunity to see a Baroque collection in the house that is was originally kept in. The building itself is stunning. The reason I wanted to visit the Borghese was to see the paintings by Caravaggio. There are 5 works by Caravaggio in the gallery. St Jerome is stunning. I am not so impressed by how they are hung. The larger works are high up, I presume because they have so many works and so little space. But they are still magic.The Bernini collection is impressive. The Rape of Proserpina (1622) is stunning. The skill of Bernini is displayed in how the hands of Pluto press in on the marble flesh of the goddess. The dog Cerberus is incredible, with one head turned away, seemingly looking out the window on the modern Rome outside.I booked and paid for tickets online. It is the only way to get into the gallery. You line up in the underground chamber of the building to collect your tickets from a booking number. You then get two hours to see the entire collection. It is not too difficult, but the feeling of the gallery is a bit overwhelming as the art collected here is rich, intricate, luxuriant.I would totally recommend the Galleria Borghese if you are interested in European art, very rich (dead) cardinals or vast houses. The park around the house is also very good."

Roman sculpture on the ground floor, Renaissance and slightly later paintings one flight up. The guide who showed us around Rome yesterday said it's probably the 3rd most important collection in Rome, after the Vatican and the Capitoline, and I wouldn't disagree with him.But a museum isn't just the paintings. It's also getting in and out, getting around the building, and actually seeing the paintings. Especially for someone with limited mobility, this isn't a pleasant visitor experience.First, they sell tickets with an entry time and two hours to see the collection. This means you're always traveling with a bulge of people. Instead of people walking up at random times and entering as they arrive, you have this rush every two hours. You queue up to get your tickets, and you queue up to check your bags. While they limit admissions, it's a pretty small, cramped facility and there are always too many people crowding around, especially the artworks that are \"numbered\" items on the video tours.For a person with limited mobility, it's a little bit like they've never seen a disabled person before. There is an elevator for the disabled -- sort of. You're going to climb stairs no matter what, and it's not always easy to find someone to operate the elevator. If you have a person with limited mobility with you, count on spending at least 20 minutes of your two hours looking for a staff member to operate the elevator for you or watching elevators go up and down past your floor.Also, it's a tiny elevator. The people at the entrance said that the person could ride but the wheelchair wouldn't fit. REALLY? Are you kidding? What's the point of putting in an elevator if the wheelchair won't fit? The person who took us from the ground floor (sculpture) to the first floor (picture gallery) made the wheelchair fit, but then couldn't get it out when the elevator arrived, with the result that my wife had to climb out of the elevator over the wheelchair. On our exit, the person who brought us down on the elevator helpfully told us we could go out the rear exit and avoid the stairs but unhelpfully didn't tell us how to get around to the front of the building or warn us it was a gravel walk-way.The lack of staff in the galleries was weird. Like I said, it was an adventure every time we wanted to go to a different floor to find someone. They make the biggest deal of any museum I've ever been in of making you check EVERYTHING at the door, but then during the visit I saw at least a dozen people pulling out their point and shoots or smart phones to take a photograph -- and nobody to say cut it out. Museums that won't allow photographs bug me, but the ones where I'm obeying the rules and nobody else is are really infuriating.The artwork is great but it's really kind of a cattle car. And if you have the booking for the last entry (5 pm), do your shopping at the museum shop first. The place is closed up tight when you leave. I wasn't impressed."

At first sight when I arrived I thought the place is tiny and worried that I would finish everything within a short time but I went all the way to here! But I was wrong, the two hours time slot is just right and I can easily spend another hour inside it just to admire the collection. It was originally a private collection of the Borghese family. So imagine, some one with great taste and lot of money had already selected everything for you. I would really say that every single piece inside the museum is a treasure and a masterpiece. Great pieces from Bernini, Raphael, Caravaggio and many more. I really enjoyed the audio guide as well. It told us good details and histories of the great works and the Borghese family as well. Definitely worth every penny.With the limited number of tickets the gallery is not crowded at all and I could really enjoy the art with a good ambiance. It was like touring inside a private home of a noble.(well in some sense this is true!)The surrounding gardens are nice as well but I didn't have time to stay long.If I am a local I probably would want to come here every weekend!If you are choosing between a few smaller museum in Rome, I would definitely recommend this one on top of the list.Do remember to book tickets in advance as I saw people who didn't book ticket prior to coming to the museum and got back empty handed."

The queue is haphazard and disorganized, all bags must be surrendered, and the lobby before the ticketed time entrance is pandemonium. The museum, though, makes up for this unpleasantry pre-tour.

We visited here our first day in Rome. It's pretty far into the park, but just follow the signs and it's a straight shot. The Galleria Borghese houses some spectacular sculptures and paintings. If you want to feel less crowded, start with the pinacoteca (painting gallery) and then go back downstairs to the sculptures (thanks Rick Steves!). Don't miss Caravaggio's paintings! Plus, it's impossible to miss the famous Canova and Bernini sculptures, as they are the centerpieces of their rooms. Get a guidebook or audio tour because nothing is labeled. Keep in mind, there is a strict 2 hour time limit. We only needed a bit more than an hour, so this wasn't an issue for us. You must check all bags and cameras in the lobby. Bad bathrooms.Please note that a reservation in the high season is required! Having read guidebooks, we knew to make a reservation and asked our apartment proprietor to call for us (and he was kind enough to do so). It's free to call (+39 06 32810) and there is an English speaking option. Or, for an extra fee, you can book online (http://www.tosc.it). The base price of the ticket is 13 Euro. You must show up about 30 minutes in advance for your reservation, or they may release your tickets to people waiting on \"stand by.\" For this very reason, we called in our reservation so we didn't have to pay in advance."

It's a museum folks, with great paintings, great d\u00e9cor (ceilings, tromp l'oeil, etc.), many sculptures from Roman times, and great renaissance sculpture and paintings, including more wonderful sculptures by Bernini that I have ever seen. If you don't know his work....please see it. He and Michelangelo were equals as sculptors in my book. His work here ranks with the pieta and the David. So, if you're into art museums, you have to see this one. If you aren't....well, you get it."

The grounds are pretty and do make for a nice walk as well. The not-so-great: Aside from the initial ticketing guy, every other staff member we encountered was either dismissive or outright rude. The two women issuing audioguides were so involved in their very loud personal conversation that they left me (and others) just standing right in front of them for several minutes - until they finally decided to acknowledge our presence. And even then, they were very abrupt. I wasn't hugely comfortable handing over all my family's passports to them to just sit on the counter in an open box while paid more attention to their conversation than their jobs. The worst was the older woman taking tickets. She didn't speak any English and after practically yanking our tickets from us, I tried asking her a question about where we needed to start. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day, but she literally gave us a dirty look, said something very loudly in Italian, and waved us away very angrily! She made it clear that she was NOT interested in answering any questions. We're not overly sensitive tourists, but we were taken aback by her.As I said, the artwork itself is world-class, and dealing with a few rude staff is still very much worth it to visit the Galleria Borghese."

It's in the Villa Borghese Park, that's also a nice place, and is one of the most high concentration of beauty and masterpieces of art I've ever seen. The Bernini works are worth a trip (to Italy! not only to Rome) and they are just a part of the gallery (actually a big part...). Remember you NEED a reservation to get in, so plan your trip and your visit here in advance, and be patient at the entrance because the entry system is not so clear and smart but don't worry the waiting will be rewarded by an astounding experience!"

We chose a late afternoon tour of the Galleria Borghese as the way to end our recent trip to Umbria and Rome, and our high expectations were exceeded because we were lucky enough to have Serena Cantagalli as our guide. We had been to the Borghese once before, and marveled at the Bernini and Canova statues and the Caravaggio and Titian paintings and many of the other amazing works there. Having Serena set the stage, provide the background not only of the works themselves but the purpose and use of the building in which they were displayed made the experience unforgettable.Serena doesn't read from a script. She asks questions about our interests and experiences, and then selects details, facts and points of interest to enhance and build upon what we bring to the works of art. The result is a tailor-made experience that leaves us with a richer and deeper understanding of the works of art, and in the process, gives us plenty to think about beyond the artworks and their times. We were lucky enough to visit the Vatican two years ago with Serena as our guide, and guessed correctly that she would be the perfect leader for a visit to the Borghese. Serena's company \"Rome Is Easy\" (www.romeiseasy.com; info@romeiseasy.com) made all the arrangements (access to the museum is in 2-hour timed blocks, so securing tickets in advance is a must -- Mariangela at Rome Is Easy saw to all of that). All we had to do is meet Serena in our hotel lobby and enjoy an ideal late afternoon at the museum, followed by a leisurely walk through the gardens and back to the heart of Rome. As if her knowledge of a wide variety of art styles and eras is not enough, Serena's gelato and restaurant recommendations have never failed us, and our last night in Rome was capped by an authentic casual Roman Saturday night dinner thanks to her. We could not ask for a better way to finish our trip, and look forward to the next time we can cross paths with Serena and great works of art (if only she would offer tours of New York's Metropolitan or MoMA!)."

            "review": "Totally unresponsive and rude to disabled travelers!. This museum claims to be wheelchair accessible, but is anything but. There are no signs outside pointing to accessible entry, (although there happens to be one, but it is not used - not making this up - read on). To get to the ticket booth, one has to climb down about ten steep steps without any guardrails or hand support. My wife who uses the wheelchair, is able to walk short distances, however I had to carry the chair down the steps. I don't know how this is done by disable people who are wheelchair bound and cannot walk at all. But this was just for starters. The entry to the first and second floor galleries is from the basement up a flight of a steep, spiral staircase. This is not a problem for able bodied individuals. My wife was asked to get out of her wheelchair and get into a small elevator up to the (second) floor. We had to leave our wheelchair in the basement and were given another one, belonging to the museum on the second floor. When we finished viewing the second floor, we had to give up their wheel chair, go back to the elevator down to the first floor, but now there were no wheel chairs on the first floor. So we slowly walked through the rooms, looking for the chairs normally used by the museum guards so my wife could rest before going on. No one approached us, asked us for assistance or help. Finally we made it back to the elevator, went down to the basement and collected our wheelchair. Now we had to leave the building and go back up to the street level from the basement ticket area. I noticed a perfectly new chair elevator in the so-called \"scuola\" room, and asked to be allowed to use it. They said no! They sent my wife again in the small elevator to the street level, and told me to carry our own wheelchair up the flight of steep spiral staircase myself. They did not offer to help. The guards and museum personnel who did speak English were brusque to the point of rudeness, others did not speak English (or pretended not to), and did not seem perturbed by a sight of a 61 year old man lugging his wheelchair up the stairs in their museum. Finally, we were let out through a side door, to the back of the villa. By now my wife could not walk anymore, and the gravel behind the villa was almost impossible to push through. A young official who unlocked (!) the back door to let us out appeared to speak English but did not care to offer any help, or make any comments. So, in a country and a city which do not offer almost any disability accommodations to begin with, Galleria Borghese reached a new low in adding additional rudeness, incompetence, and utter disregard for disabled travelers. We have been traveling with the wheelchair around the world for many years, with little problem. Almost everywhere else, when the process, or equipment breaks down, human concern and sympathy takes over and people help even to the point of manually carrying the wheelchair. The Italian officials at Villa Borghese managed to exhibit an almost unbelievable disregard for the most basic humane concerns for fellow human beings, let alone their paying customers. For shame Rome, Italy and Villa Borghese!!"

The Bernini sculptures The Rape of Prosperine, David, and Apollo and Daphne made the museum a must-see for me.

We love museums and always take our time, but we easily made it through in less than the 2 hours allotted. It is in the Borghese Gardens, but a long walk unless you are in the right part of the grounds. We took a cab to the gallery because we were tired and running late for our reservation time. After, we walked back to dinner near Piazza Popolo...a LONG walk which I would not do after dark, but it was light until almost 9pm. Know that you cannot take pictures so be ready to check your camera. We left ours in the hotel. The grounds are pretty so it would have been nice to have a picture or two. They are pretty strict about checking bags, but amazingly we were allowed to bring bottled water in. Very glad we went in spite of some of the other comments. If this is your first trip to Rome, I would only do this if you have done all of the other big sites. For those of us who have been before it is well worth making time to go."

A lot of people didn't know you had to book ahead and if you have a Roma pass you need to call or go there as your first trip if you want to go in for free.They were very well organised and things went smoothly, everything has to be checked in, no phones and you need to get there early to pick up your tickets, which was not a problem because the Villa Borghese is absolutely beautiful. We brought fruit and ate it as we waited til we got in at EXACTLY the time the time slot began. There IS a second floor, picture gallery, so dont miss it.We were floored when we saw the Caravaggios, sad the boy with a basket of fruit wasn't there at the time, or St, Jeromes if I remember correctly but all the Berninis were which was fantastic. Everyone gasps in awe when they come across them for the first time and with only 200 people there, at most, everyone could get a good view. I loved the contrast of Caravaggio and Bernini's \"self portraits, {sich Baccus and David)...

First, the caveat: the ticket sellers at Borghese are clipped at best, on a par with the famous moralising lecturers at the Louvre (\"your scarf goes to a different garderobe, monsieur\"). They know you desperately want to get in, and you do: tickets are sold in two hour intervals and in high season you have to book days ahead, so don't mess with them. Book on-line.Once you're in, run ahead of the pack and start several rooms on, then double back. The Borghese is quite easy to see in two hours, and the non-discriminating part of the crowd heads for the big ticket Caravaggio and Berninis. You'll soon find yourself alone. And the Berninis in particular are more than worth the price of admission: great examples of his ability to find compositional brilliance in twisting, dynamic torsos full of drama. Not every piece in the gallery is worth a look; as with the Louvre's obligatory but decidedly mediocre 18th century French collection, the post-Renaissance Italian work at the Borghese leaves a lot to be desired. No matter. Once you're done ogling the Bernini sculptures, head outside into the small garden and check out whether there's an exhibition at the far end. t's included in your ticket and it often takes the form of a marked contrast with all the classicism in the gallery proper.Once you walk out of the gallery, remind yourself that in you're in one of the most peaceful parts of busy Roma--a huge park that is never over-crowded.

You can also use your Roma Pass to get the tickets, but then you will have to wait until you arrive in Rome, buy the passes, and then you need to phone the Galleria for the time. Each ticket gives you two hours of access, and then the rooms are cleared for the next group. The two hours is not enough, so you might consider doing it twice. The audio guides are good, but there is so much to see that the guides don't cover. The two hour limit has its advantages, however, since it means that the gallery is not over-crowded, unlike the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.No cameras are allowed. Indeed, no handbags or backpacks, for that matter. All such things must be checked. Get to the gallery 30 minutes before your entrance time to pick up your tickets, and to drop off your stuff at the checkroom.Don't tell your taxi driver you want to go to the Villa Borghese, or you'll be dropped off at the wrong spot.

Two second-tier Van Goghs are worth seeing, as is a first-rate Jackson Pollack and a stunning Klimpt. For some reason, there are no Picassos, and only one Modigliani. So, if you want an all-art day, walk west through the park to see its collection.Enjoy!"

The area around the Galleria is beautiful, and I would recommend spending some time there. Think Italian version of Central Park. It's about a 15-20 minute walk (uphill) from the Spanish Steps, so it's easy to make a day out of it. The gardens are at the time of Via Veneto, a famous street in Rome with the U.S. Embassy on it."

I have friends that stayed a week in Rome and couldn't get tickets. Last time I visited I bought mine on the website Tickitaly.com. You choose the date and time, pay in advance, print your tickets and basically just walk in. We took the subway but still had a bit of a walk to get there.

You must reserve your tickets in advance, so plan ahead! The nearest Metro stop is Spagna; the Galleria is a 20 minute walk from there; note there is a tunnel in the Metro station for \"Villa Borghese\" which eliminates walking along streets, but it leads to a rather forlorn location on the far southwestern part of the Villa grounds. From there, head due east until you find roads and signage which will lead you to the museum."

Even so, you still have to wait on line after admission - I believe they let people by groups & timeslots.When you enter, you are greeted with 3 flights of stairs. You navigate the galleries floor by floor. Keep your admission ticket as it is required for use of the bathroom on the ground level.Taking pictures was prohibited which is a shame, as Borghese had some of the loveliest sculptures we have ever seen, very detailed, artistic and emotive. The rooms themselves were beautiful. There are laminated room guides you can read in some of the rooms, but an audio guide or book would probably have significantly enhanced our experience here.Lastly, make sure you allot some extra time to enjoy the park right by the museum. I would suggest booking your museum admission for the early/mid-afternoon and then spending the rest of the afternoon in the park. They rent bicycles and motorized 2 & 4-seaters at a reasonable price for you to bike around the park and see all the sights. At the other end of the park affords one a great elevated view of Rome. There are bus stops in the park with small buses that will take you in the direction of the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navona, in time for a nice dinner."

The 'raw materials' that the museum has to work with are wonderful - opulent marble decor, trompe l'oeil extravaganzas, scores of dark renaissance paintings and a setting within Rome's largest central park. The things that really let it down for us were: 1. Rude staff on the ticket desk - really unpleasant. 2. Interpretation was awful and very old fashioned. We did not get the audio tour and I believe that some basic info should be freely available as part of admission prices. It was over-verbose in places and not available for many pieces. Given the prices and popularity the museum can't be that short of resources, so possibly down to laziness/arrogance. 3. Cant use Roma Pass unless you phone4.

There was not sufficient places to sit and wait and once we were allowed in, we had to climb 3 flights of stairs. By the time we got to the top, we were ready to leave. We were not impressed with the way the art was displayed and even though there was some incredible Bernini sculptures, we did not find the descriptions next to the art pieces to be very complete especially if you had limited knowledge of this period of art.

As many other reviewers have mentioned, you must book a reservation well in advance and be there about 15 minutes before your entry time. You have two hours to complete your tour. I suggest that you set aside enough time to enjoy the paintings on the second floor and that you take the time to fully contemplate Bernini's Apollo and Daphne sculpture, which is my favorite sculpture (including Michelangelo's David!). Also, set aside time to walk the grounds outside. On our recent visit, a young man from Ukraine was playing his accordion as he sat on a bench--and he was extraordinary. This is great art in a grand setting."

Luckily I had read this advice on Trip Advisor \"City Guide\" before we left the States. The museum is limited to 350 people during each 2 hour segment and we saw many people turned away. Second word of advice: purchase the audio tour and start at the beginning. We started at the entrance and we were very confused until we realized that the audio tour starts elsewhere. Third word of advice: Enjoy! If you love Bernini, this museum is unsurpassed. Unfortunately, no photography is allowed. Oh well, I had to buy a few post cards.Another suggestion: take a cab to be on time."

My favorite work was The Rape of Proserpine. I loved how you could see the indention of her skin as he pressed on her leg. My husbands was the Caravaggio paintings. Bernini's work was equally impressive. The are very strict about checking in bags and no cameras. Try to soak in as much as you can in your two hour slot!"

Beautifully displayed, feels intimate. You need reservations (at least a few days in advance during busy season). The reservations mean the Galleria is never too crowded. There were guided tours going on, we paid 5 Euro for the self-guided audio tour offered in several languages. I liked it, it allowed us to go at our own pace. Another hint for you, as long as you keep track of where you have been, you don't have to go in order with the self-guided tours. If the room you step into is crowded, try the next one, then come back. It takes only 1.5-2 hours to view the entire collection. Here's another tip: if you are in Rome in busy season (June-August) it can get very hot in the afternoon. Plan an outdoor activity in the morning and reserve your time at Borghese from 2-4 or 3-5pm. Nice book /souvenir shop and cafe too."

The next available tickets were for three days ahead and there was a 2 Euro reservation charge per person. As we are over 65 and EU citizens we didn't have to pay for the tickets. This is true for many museums in Rome. You need your passport as proof of age. Having got lost getting there the first time we took the advice given at the ticket office and took the bus 910 from Termini. This stops in the road to the side of the villa, a hundred metres from the Galeria. Take nothing with you otherwise you will have to queue to leave the stuff and collect it afterwards....and they charge, take only a wallet or whatever that can fit in your pocket. You get 2 hours in there but I would say that it is as much as the average person can absorb in the time of what is an intense and concentrated experience with some real show stoppers. The quality of the collection is overwhelming. It should be remembered that this place is not like a regular art gallery with a representative and balanced collection but instead the collection of mainly one family at a particular period in time. I had one of the best art experiences ever and for my personal outlay of 2 Euros to go in plus 3 Euros total in bus fares (apart from London where galleries are free) it was cheap as chips as we say at home!"

The set up is a little confusing and you have to check knapsacks, umbrellas, etc. but once you're in it's fine. No photos. The audioguide is worth getting, you'll need to give them some ID for the rental which they give back to you when you return the audioguide. We used our driver's license.

One has to book several days ahead, as small groups are allowed in for two-hour slots, but don't let that put you off. I feel that many works, like Canova's reclining sculpture of Paulina Borghese (Napoleon's sister) and Bernini's Apollo and Daphne, are without rivals anywhere; you can see each unfolding leaf gradually embracing Daphne, transforming her gracefully into a tree. Among the many famous and excellent paintings, I particularly like Antonello da Messina's Portrait of a Man, and Titian's Sacred and Profane Love, as well as Cranach's Venus (wearing only an astounding hat) with a tree trunk and stubby sceptical Cupid making her seem even more elongated. Apart from the exhibits, each room provides a different sort of grandiose architectural appeal. The villa is set in a very large and varied park, so walking back across to the Pincio is indeed pleasant. From there you find yourself above Piazza del Popolo, and by turning right, Villa Medici and the top of the Spanish Steps."

The art was amazing (Bernini, sculptures, Caravaggio paintings, etc., etc.) and the building is located within a beautiful park. And it's quality over quantity: the museum is not overly large so the visit will not wear you out. Another must-see if you are in Rome and you like art.What made this rating \"average\" was the problematic customer service. Because the gallery only lets a certain number of visitors in at a time, and for a fixed (2-hour) period, it is strongly advised to make reservations well in advance. We did so, and were given reservations from 3 pm to 5 pm, with instructions to show up at 2:30 pm to pick up our tickets, check our bags, etc. so we could take full advantage of our two hours. We arrived well before 2:30 and found a sign on the door that the building was closed from 1 to 3 pm for a \"worker's assembly.\" Not only did this make it impossible for us get in early, as we had been instructed, but all of the people who had been scheduled for the 1 to 3 pm slot were standing around wondering what to do. At 3 pm the door (there was only one) opened and a mob of people--all of the 3 pm bunch and many of the 1 pm bunch--swarmed in and descended on the ticket desk. Luckily, we had been very close to the door and therefore got our tickets quickly and lost only 15 minutes from our two hours. But as far as I can tell, the 1:00 group was simply out of luck, and the 3:00 people who were at the back of the pack probably spent a significant part of their two hours standing in line. As far as I know, they got kicked out at 5:00 so the next group could come in.The point of all this--and the reason for the middlin' review--is that there was never any explanation, and as far as I could tell, no sympathy or efforts to accommodate, from the staff. I have no idea what a \"worker's assembly\" is, or how often they take place, so maybe there is something I am missing. What we experienced may be a rare occurrence. But the attitude seemed to be \"it happens, and there's nothing we can do to make it right.\""

I went without guide/audio guide and wouldn't have minded a little more info. There are cards in each room that are handy - but not all seemed to match the right room. It's nice that you can get a check-in time - but that means everyone enters at once and it's kind of hectic checking your bags. Get there earlier than your check-in time.

This was in fact, my husband's favorite place out of all the places we visited. The fresco's were nothing sort of awe-inspiring. Every painting and marble sculpture are more beautiful than words can describe. Even the grounds around the galleria were beautiful. On the walk up the road to the galleria was a man playing Bach Toccata and Fugue in D minor, which just added to the atmosphere. One thing I will advise is to book in advance and be there at least a half hour before. If you arrive later THEY WILL NOT LET YOU IN!! One very angry guest was not happy when he arrived too late and they would not let him in. This is good though in a way; because they only allow so many people in at once, it means you do not have to compete with crowds to see anything. You can stroll for as long as you wish with relative comfort. Definitely worth checking out if you come. Its a bit out of the way, but worth it!!"

            "review": "Ready, steady, art. The gallery's policy of limiting both the number of visitors at any one time and the amount of time available to visit makes this one of the most pleasurable museums to visit in the world. Especially with kids.There are no queues to see the most famous of the art-works, you can go against the crowd and start with the upper floor (concentrating largely on paintings before descending to the sculptures), and the little ones can always see around the big people, rather than being lost in a forest of bodies.The set-time for the beginning of the visit does make it seem as though you need to get there well before your time to check in your bags and cameras (the only queue we endured), but in fact we were able to take in as much as we could in well-under the allotted 2 hours.I was very anxious not to miss out, as the building conceived as a gallery holds some of the greatest works by the great masters of Western Art & sculpture including Titian's Sacred and Profane Love, Caravaggio's David and Goliath (and sick Bacchus self-portrait) and some stupendous sculptures by Bernini, including Apollo and Daphne and the abduction of persephone as well as the notorious Canova masterpiece of Pauline Bonaparte. That's without speaking of Lucas Cranach the elder, Parmigianino, Fra'Bartholomeo, Dosso Dossi, Bassano, Raphael, Reubens and many many others whose works would be worthy of a visit for them alone.So with the help of the wonderful Rossana at Caesar House we made securing a booking the highest priority on our arrival. Lucky for us, as the first available slot, on the Saturday afternoon, was for the following Wednesday at 1pm. And sure enough, when we arrived, there was one disappointed tourist hoping against hope for a no-show in order not to miss out as all tickets were already booked up for the next 3 days.Easily the kids' favourite art museum, had it not rained we would have completed a lovely afternoon discovering the Borghese Gardens by 4-person bike. It's also worth noting that children who are european citizens have a discount rate that does not apply to mere residents of Europe (pity the same can't be said of the taxes we pay) so those with children with European citizenships may want to bring your/ your children's passports at the time of booking."

They must only allow a certain number each day which is actually a good idea unlike other sites where you spend more time moving around people then actually enjoying and appreciating what you came for and you dont waste half a day lining up. Anyway it is a popular museum with a great park outside to relax in so you need to book tickets in advance, from what i have gathered at least three to four days. And i dont think it is open Mondays, there is one day it is closed."

It is just outstanding with outstanding works of sculpture (AND paintings, but mainly sculpture). Just seeing a few of the works by Canova is worth the visit. But the Galleria has much much more. My friends and relatives who usually frown on passing a day in a museum rather than out visiting the city have all fallen in love with this museum."

You must book your tour of the museum well in advance, easy to do online, and pick up your tickets in the lower floor of the museum just before your allotted time. The museum is not large, but houses the incredible sculotures of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, including his captivating statue of David. After seeing Bernini's statues, it is hard to look at any other statues without comparing them to Bernini's, as they will undoubtedly fall short. Because they limit the number of people in the gallery at any one time, you can fully appreciate all of the art and not have to fight the crowds in the process. The garden and museum make for a gorgeous afternoon outing - a must do while in Rome!"

I reserved my time slot on line which is highly recommended as when I went they were allowing preserved tickets only. I bought a Roma pass which entitles you to the first two entries to tourist attractions (excluding the Vatican), public transport and discounts on the remaining attractions for \u20ac34 This worked out to be good value as the cost of the ticket was \u20ac13. You are allowed two hours in the gallery and are not allowed to take your bags/cameras into the gallery (these are left in a secure locker whilst inside the gallery). I found the audio guide really helpful (\u20ac5). The Galleria Boghese was one of the highlights of my trip. Worth visiting if you are into art or just like looking at nice things!"

We arrived early for our 5-7pm slot and visited the bookshop in the gallery basement first. We bought a book called 10 Masterpieces of the Borghese Gallery and had a look through it while we waited to go in. it really added to our visit. We went upstairs to the Picture Gallery first, signs tell you that you will be allowed 30 minutes in here but in fact this is not enforced. However you will definitely want to leave plenty of time for the galleries downstairs where there are the most beautiful sculptures by Bernini which truly have to be seen to be believed. Along with stunning paintings and the gorgeous surroundings of the building itself, this gallery is one of our favourite places in Rome."

It was our last day in Rome and we had a flight out that evening. We had a reservation for 1 PM and we got there early (at 12:15), when we got to the ticket office we were informed to our amazement, that the museum will be closed between 1 and 3 PM. We were obviously very upset and the guy said we could come back at 3 or 5 PM, which was no good for us since we had a flight to catch. Then the guy said that we could go in from now until 1 PM (it was 12:20 by then). We took him up on that offer since we didn't have any choice. He charged us 2 Euros a person and got upset with us about not having exact change (we didn't bring our purses as we knew we couldn't take them into the museum...).We got in and rushed through the museum. The art is beautiful and there are so many works of art there. We saw the famous statues of Daphne turning into a tree and the rape of Persephone, that were indeed magnificent, but we were rushed to finish our visit at around 12:50, so we only had a decent half hour there.I will not be back there and will not recommend it to my friends. A place that has such strict rules must be the first one to uphold them. We enjoyed the Vatican museums much more (separate review)."

Visitors are admitted in groups of about 100 and have two hours to view the galleries (which is ample time). These arrangements allow you to tour the rooms without feeling overcrowded. The museum houses the finest collection of Bernini's statues not in a religious setting, Canova's sculpture of Napoleon's sister and paintings by several masters including Titian. The rooms themselves are richly ornate and would be worth a visit on their own merit. Walk to the museum through the lovely gardens of the Villa Borghese and enjoy a distinctly civilized experience (as long as you booked in advance). We found Select Italy's website (based in Chicago) a simple and very efficient way of getting our tickets in advance (tickets sent electronically about one month prior to departure and presented without fuss at the Gallery ticket office upon arrival)."

We used the Roma pass and had to call about 2 weeks prior to our visit to make reservations. We did not have to pay with the Roma pass even though it was our third attraction. We paid for the audio guides - worth it. And the 2 hours they recommend is perfect. It's not overcrowded like other museums (except for the gift shop) which makes it very pleasant experience."

The art collection is really gd and varied from painted masterpieces by Carravaggio, to marble sculptures by master sculptor Loreno Bernini. The audio guide is a must-have in order to best understand the art, artist, and even the history of how the Borghese family went about collecting these works or art. One of the best audio guides we've heard during our time in italy this far - lively voice with appropriate background music. The grounds around the galleria villa is also a sight to behold on weekends with families picnicking, joggerz n walkers abundant with their dogs in tow etc."

If you get to the front of the line and the ticket attendant asks if you have a reservation and you say \"no\", they will tell you it's sold out and not possible to get in. They might be rude and abrupt. My advice is stick around and be persistent. At the last minute they will open up the line and allow non reservation holders in to purchase tickets. Some people who are turned away leave and and people who stick around get in with a swift nod just past the hour. It worked for us and the 10-15 or so people like us without a reservation.

I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the first floor art (maybe the bar had been set too high by what I\u2019d already seen - and if the Carravagios on the ground floor had been up there with them it would have made it better). Having said that the two hours you\u2019re given (you only get 2 hours before having to leave) went too quickly and so I didn\u2019t have enough time to do the full first floor. I would have liked at least another hour in there.

We booked about a week in advance, using the phone. The operator spoke good English, which was good since I didn't trust my Italian to get the job done. She gave us a booking code to present to the desk along with the RomaPass. They state to arrive 30 minutes prior to your scheduled entrance, but we were running pretty late. We arrived at 4:50pm for a 5pm entrance, but they let us in and we checked our bags just in time for 5pm. Lucky, though, since we saw several people lined up who would have taken our spots had we been late.

Sign on the counter said that tickets were sold out for the next 3 days. Each \"group\" gets 2 hours to visit the museum, which is plenty of time for most people. The one thing I'd say is that unlike other museums, there is not a lot of information on the artwork you are looking at. Most rooms had laminated sheets in Italian/English that explained the artwork in the room, however, these sheets were not current. Some did not match up to the artwork that was actually in the room. The paintings were nice, however, I'd have to say that the artwork on the ceilings are what really make the visit worthwhile. Some of these ceilings are breathtaking! The sculptures run a close second.After we left the gallery (after about 90 minutes) we stopped by the bookstore. They had some really good books there that explained the artwork we saw. If I went again, I'd probably buy one of these books before going into the Gallery. It'll help you understand what you're looking at."

Our entry time was 5 pm and you have access for 2 hours only. But after touring many sites in Rome our legs and feet were giving out on us. Our plan to be at the front of the entry line so as to be in first, we made it through all the rooms enjoying every detail, (I had studied ahead of time and shared details as we went) We were finished in 30 minutes and everyone was happy. Could we have stayed longer? Yes, but we were trying to do it all (Rome) and it is hard to get everything in but Yes, you should schedule a visit to Galleria Borghese. Don' miss the statues - they are fabulous!"

Luckily for us, no one else was on our tour so we ended up with a private tour of the gallerie with our wonderful guide. She was knowledgable and spoke well. Our 11 year daughter loved the tour as the guide explained things in a very simple and clear manner. The sculptures there are wonderful. The Apollo sculpture, the Pauline Bonaparte Venus, they were all a must see. There are a few paintings worth seeing there but the gems are the sculptures. IMHO this was more fun than the Vatican museum, where the crowds made it impossible to enjoy the art."

Ladies must check their purses before entering (pick them up when leaving), and no matter how few people are in the museum, you may not enter until the time on your ticket. The staff is not friendly.

What I did was call the museum from home and made reservations, so you don't need to pre-purchase tickets but you do need to reserve before going, just make sure you write down your reservation number. Cons:1. You must leave all cell phones, cameras & bags at the counter. I was not happy about that but everything was returned safely. 2. Limited time. You only have, I believe, 2 hours for you visit.Pros:1. Stunning museum. Everything was so beautiful.2. Guided Tour with Historian: While waiting for our turn, I noticed 2 signs. One sign was for an audio tour, which was for 5 euros and the other was for a guided tour with a historian, which was 6.50 euros. We decided to go for the guided tour with historian and let me tell you, it was money well spent. We had a very knowledgeable guide and she brought certain paintings and sculptures to life. She was not only knowledgeable, but very expressive and it totally added to our experience. It was definitely a highlight our trip to Rome. This is not a tour of the entire museum but a tour of the \"must-sees\" in the gallery. Once you're done, check out the park for a leisurely stroll. Also, the Spanish Steps are close by if you want to check that out, though I found it to be overcrowded and overrated."

You have to reserve your tickets at least a week before the day of your visit. You have to bring the confirmed reservation email (on your phone or a print out) and be there at least 30 minutes before your entry time. The process of getting tickets is not complicated. Remember, they do not allow any bags or cameras inside, so you need to check them in at no cost. I recommend getting an audio guide that helps you with the exhibits because you only have 2 hours time. Do not use spend your 2 hour time to visit the gift shop or the cafe. You can do that later. Also, most people will start the tour at the lower gallery and go to the picture gallery (upper) during the last 30 minutes. I suggest you reverse the order so that the galleries are not crowded for you. The only bad experience I had was with the staff who were distributing audio guides. They were plainly rude and refused to answer any questions. I later found out that they only open 20 minutes prior to the entrance to distribute the audio guides. Instead of answering my question about the audio guide, she yelled at me in Italian and pushed us out and sealed the area.The gallery is fantastic. The upper gallery has Raffael's painting (The deposition) and Caravaggios's paintings (David and the Goliath) which are must see. Downstairs, they have several unique statues of Bernini (Pluto and Prosperino and David ) and Canova (Paulina Boanparte), which are all must see. Note: You are only allowed more than 30 minutes at the upper picture gallery. Interesting note: The owner of the gallery, Cardinal Scipione Borghese was the nephew of Pope Paul V. Apparently, Scipione Borghese was not a very religious person. He was appointed as a Cardinal by his uncle the Pope. In Italian nephew is called nepote, which lead to the word nepotism or favoritism!"

Overall a great experience in a museum that is not overly crowded and where you can take your time (within 2 hours!) to enjoy the art. ADMISSION1. Book your tickets online at least 1 week or more in advance: http://www.tosc.it/ (Else there is NO way you are getting in. A man in front of me tried to buy tickets on the spot and was turned away. ) Your ticket allows you a 2 hour visit.2. Plan to arrive at least 15 mins before your admission time as you will need to queue up to show your receipt to the admission desk for your tickets and then queue up AGAIN to check in your camera and bagsCHECK IN 1. Yes, you will need to check in your bags and all cameras. They are strict about that. Try to pack light that day because these are not huge lockers. TOUR1. Bring a guide book with you so you know what you are looking at, or pick up an audio tour guide. I used the Rick Steves tour and it was fine. I had ample time to take in the Bernini statues and the Caravaggios and Raphael paintings.It's great that they limit the visitors and the time. The rooms never felt too crowded or overheated and it just made for a pleasant experience. There's a bathroom there and I took a leisurely time and still completed my tour with 5 minutes to spare!Afterwards, take a stroll down Via Veneto and get a snack in the many cafes there!"

My favorite was Bernini's Apollo e Davne Sorry no pictures allowed in gallery; this leads me to some other tips.1.) Tickets are timed stamped in 2 hour intervals beginning at 09:00 and last entry is 17:00. BUY ONLINE ahead of time to avoid your preferred time slot selling out. 2.) No bags (even purses) allowed in the gallery. We found out the hard way after waiting in the long line we had to go all the way back to bag check. 3.)

The gallery is simply the best collection of baroque art anywhere--the Bernini sculptures will overwhelm you. We visited the sculpture floor, then cruised through the painting gallery (I'm sure I didn't appreciate it as I should have--I wanted to get back to the Berninis), then went back to the sculptures for a less-crowded look. Two hours was about right at one sitting, but I could do that museum over and over again. The Villa grounds are wonderful, too--Roman families out for a day in the park, musicians playing, and the umbrella pines--nearly perfect. Don't miss the chance to walk to the Pincio while you're there."

Every room in the gallery is intricately decorated and stunning, full of different masterpieces, and no two rooms are the same. Beautiful! A very worthwhile visit which will take no more than 2 hours out of your day in a visit to Rome. You can even squeeze in a visit to this museum if you have lots to do in Rome and feel as though you don't have enough time to fit it all in: booking the 5-7pm visit is ideal, as that way you can go to the gallery after the main sightseeing of your morning and afternoon, and before dinner."

Having battled with the crowds at the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, it was a delight to visit a gallery which restricted access tickets to a sensible number. There were plenty of visitors, but enough space to see everything and to go round at your own pace.We loved the scale of the place and the combination of superb sculptures on one floor and paintings on the others, plus wonderful ceiling paintings throughout. The audio guides were really good - clear and just the right amount of detail. One niggle - the room numbers on the audio guide and the numbers over the entrance doors to each room did not match - this caused some debate initially! Our only irritation was the system for entrance - as tickets were all timed once every two hours, it meant that there were queues to get in. The cloakroom requirement was really frustrating - most people had small bags but we were told we had to check in. So, there was a queue of annoyed people, and then if you needed to take a purse/passport whatever with you, you had to get a plastic bag from them which often had a bigger capacity than the bag you were not allowed to take in!This frustration evaporated once you'd spent a few minutes looking round.The other huge benefit of the Borghese is that it's situated in the Borghese Gardens which are glorious. We were there on a sunny Sunday and it was a delight to wander round, watching people relaxing, cycling, roller blading, chatting."

We caught the last session of the day (5 PM) and some of the sculptures were not well lit without the additional lighting from the windows. The audio guide was helpful, but the corresponding numbers on the works of art were very small and hard to find. Perhaps a guided tour or a detailed book with descriptions might have made the experience more useful. Given all the hype, the difficulty getting tickets, the timed entry etc, I expected more. If you enter from the outside and try to find the staircase to the second floor at the start of the session, good luck! The guards have this nondescript glass door leading to the stairwell to the second floor closed for the first 15 minutes until the crowds from the basement have made their way directly to the second floor. I had to ask them to open it for me. Better to enter from the basement if you plan on finding the second floor. It wasn't a total loss, we stopped for some great desserts at one of the 5 star hotels on the via Veneto on the walk from the Barberini metro stop. (The 910 bus is also a quick way to get there from the Termini.) If you go to the Borghese, make sure you get to the Vatican Museum as well. Even though the Sistine Chapel was closed due to the conclave while we were there, the newly restored Raphael rooms and the \"School of Athens\" was worth the price of admissions to all the museums (including the Borghese) and sites during our week in Rome."

The beautiful building is host to a large number Renaissance paintings and an even more impressive collection of sculptures and statues .Unfortunately the initial part of the visitor experience is terrible . Having pre booked for a two hour \"slot\" ( 9am , 11am , 1pm , or 3pm ) you are advised to turn up a half hour early . This is to give you time to queue for tickets and then to queue again for the compulsory bag drop ( don't try to do the bag drop first as they wont let you ) . You then congregate in a large group to the rear of the entrance floor , waiting to be admitted . If you are elderly or infirm don't bank upon having anywhere to sit as seating is at a minimum . When the doors finally open there is a mass scrum to enter the first gallery on the first floor . Having been warned of this , we hung back and tried to start our viewing on the second floor but were prevented from doing so by a brusk official who was guarding the stairs and insisted that we join the throng . The system of pre booking is presumably to avoid overcrowding , so why on earth do they force the entire population of the museum to enter the same gallery all at the same time ! Bizarre . It is difficult to envisage many visitors spending the full two hours at the museum , so why not start letting the earlier arrivals enter upto half an hour before their allotted slot time .It is a shame that the bureaucrats have managed to spoil what should be a pleasant and relaxing visit ."

I also didn't know how our day would pan out, so we didn't reserve tickets. We walked the park first, which was HUGE... it took us forever to get to the actual museum. And when we did, they told us we had to wait until 5. So we stood there looking sad, and they took pity on us and acknowledged that the earlier time slot hadn't sold out, so they let us in. Definitely get the audio tour, the written guides are hard to follow, and they audio guides will help you block out the tours in various languages going on around you. The Berninis are AMAZING. Definitely this small museum is worth the trip."

There are a few Caravaggio paintings and Bernini sculptures but not worth going through all the hassles to just see those. Quite a few churches in the city, not to mention St Peter's, have much better examples of these artists' works. I went through the whole thing in 45'."

There is a dining spot, (The Cinema, I think?), on the Borghese campus that has a buffet lunch. It's pricey but if the weather permits, you can eat outside and enjoy fabulous food and wine before or after your visit to the Museo. The audio tour of the gallery is good-- make sure you buy it-- for commentary on the Bernini statues and Caravaggio paintings. And you must book tickets beforehand. There were angry foreigners (not Americans, thankfully) who were turned away for lack of making a simple reservation beforehand. The website is tricky but figure it out. And once you get to this little piece of paradise, don't rush! Slow down and enjoy."

I ended up using an general Italy tourism website to book our tickets, as the main GB website is difficult to use. Exchanging your voucher for tickets in the crowded downstairs ticket area is crazy with tourists and not well organized, but once you get through that step, you are on your way to a very special museum experience. The residence was closed for many years, its collections hidden away from the world. Now, you can tour the magnificent house set in the verdant Borghese Gardens and get close to some of Bernini's (and other) great works of art. The entire museum can be viewed in two hours at a leisurely pace. I recommend booking at 11, then going somewhere nearby for lunch. Warning: Our friend was pickpocketed just outside of the museum by an Indian couple that asked for directions. When she opened her purse to look for a map, off they went with her money. She didn't even know it had happened before it was too late. So, be careful here and all over Rome with your money, and don't talk to any strangers."

We went and the was a large group of people clustered around the door - maybe 50? Then they let everyone in at once to a small entryway and it was packed with people. It was a mob scene. A woman who was there with her handicapped son couldn't get near the ticket window. Finally we got into the museum and they had us wait on another line to check our bags. We finally got into the gallery and felt like what we saw wasn't worth the ordeal of getting in. It is a terrible and unsafe system and needs to be improved and we were there off season! I think we would be disappointed even further had we paid to get in. We used one of the free museums on our Roma cards to get into the gallery.

You must make reservations in advance to visit this site, and are provided a ticket to tour the gallery for a 2 hour block of time with a stated entrance and exit time. March is a perfect time to go because the crowds are slim, and we were able to get reservations the night before we visited -- an impossible feat in the high season. The site is easily accessible via the Spagna metro site with about a 10 minute walk through Borghese Park to the gallery. The park is very beautiful, and there are gardens at the gallery that can be viewed as well. The sculpture and paintings within the gallery are wonderful. We particularly enjoyed the ancient Roman gladiator mosaics that decorate the villa's floors. An audio tour is available, and I would recommend it to get the background on the various works on exhibit."

I went on a sunday - the queue was ten deep no one had a ticket (bar me) and the next available tickets were for Tuesday - and this was in March - off peak!! For this - i would also advise the audio guide (5e) there is so much to see - you only get 2 hours (entrance is at 9/11/1/3pm) and so you want to make the most of your time. For many its Room 8 where the Caravaggios hang that has the most appeal - although for me the dimple in the marble skin of one of the sculptures just amazed me. the galleria is in the BOrghese gardens - try and remember your route in and out - you can lose your bearings easily if you take a wrong turn in the gardens. The equitation area brings you back to the metro where it is an underground walk back to the Spanish steps."

This was my first trip to the Galleria Borghese and I am very glad that I went.Here are the main points I discovered:You must book your visit in advance. As soon as you know when you intend to visit, check the Galleria Borghese website and book your tickets. I think that they allow bookings up to 6 weeks ahead. The sooner you can book the better. If you call them you can use your Roma pass to get a reduction on the ticket price, but I simply booked online and paid the full price of 13 euro per person.Visits are booked for a specific day and 2 hour time slot. Do plan to arrive at the Galleria in plenty of time before your time slot, maybe 30 minutes. You need to deposit any bags at the locker room beforehand. You are also not allowed to take pictures or video anywhere inside the museum.Also, note that the Galleria Borghese is quite a trek from central Rome. Even if you get off at one of the nearer metro stops (eg Spagna) it is still a long walk, maybe 30 minutes or 45 minutes. It is also not that well signposted. So, either allow plenty of time for your journey or consider a bus or taxi. There is also no cover on the walk to the Galleria and if it does rain (as it did on us!) you can get quite wet. Come prepared for the weather!Do always consider a Roma pass when visiting Rome. It costs 30 euro but gets you into your first 2 attractions free and many more at half price. It also gives you free transport for 3 days on the buses and metro and allows you to bypass the ticket queues which can be a real boon at some attractions.There aren't really any other major attractions in the immediate vicinity of the Galleria, so you need to plan what you are going to do with the other half of the day. The Galleria does sit in a large and very pleasant park which in some places has excellent views of Rome. It is often recommended to visit the upper floor of the museum first, which houses the paintings. This is because most people start downstairs with the sculpture. The idea is that by the time you have seen the paintings (which I found only moderately interesting) the people on the lower floor will have finished looking at the sculpture and will start to leave, allowing you more spce to see the sculptures. This is what we did and it worked quite well.The sculptures are truly remarkable and it's hard to imagine that sculpture could ever exceed what is here. In particular the sculpture of Napoleons sister on a couch and the sculpture of Apollo and Daphne are incredible. The couch, despite being of marble, really looks like a comfy couch and how the leaves and branches were done I do not know!I did not notice a cafe at the museum, although there may well be one. There are of course toilet facilities."

I don't speak any Italian, but I had no trouble reserving our times, and the phone call took all of 4 minutes.Once we got to Rome in the afternoon, we had a lot of trouble finding the 116 bus that takes you right up to the Borghese Gallery, and one passed us by at a bus stop because we weren't on the curb waiving vigorously enough for the driver to stop. We did finally catch a 116 bus and it took us right to the museum. To spare the frustration, I wish we had researched before we got to Rome the exact street coordinates where the 116 picks up, and more importantly, where we wanted to get off when we were finished at the gallery. We rode it very far out of our way when we were done because it was dark and we didn't know when to get off the bus!I am glad we invested the additional 5 to 7 euro (cash only!) in an audio tour so we weren't just gazing at stuff without knowing why it was special. Also FYI, you cannot take ANY bags (purses, etc.) into the gallery. They have a monitored bag check, and though I was a bit nervous about leaving my purse anywhere, its contents came back undisturbed.After seeing the place, I wished we would've headed directly upstairs to see the paintings first, then came down to see the sculpture on the first floor so we could have had the sculptures to ourselves for the remaining two hours. The sculptures are truly breathtaking, but harder to enjoy with lots of people trying to see them at the same time."

They only allow a two hour visit which is just about enough time to see the whole gallery, but they start to clear the gallery after a hour and fifty minutes. The metro stop is the Spagna and there are signs to the gallery in the metro. You then walk to the house through the park, which is also stunning. The house is so beautiful, that it's worth a visit on it's own without all the amazing art. The gallery contains the most determined looking statue of David that I've ever seen in my life!! This is a must see for Rome (and you get discount with your Roma pass!)"

The paintings and marble sculptures are from the most talented and renowned of Italian artists. It was refreshing to see such a variety of work as many museums in Italy are guilty of \"Madonna and child\" overload. The art is so excellent that you can easily return several times and enjoy it just as much as your first visit. It's also a very warm and attractive building where the lighting and environment seem to compliment the displays in a seamless fashion. Bernini's marble statues left an especially strong impression on us. That's saying a lot since the competition for greatness is really evident at the Borghese. However, his statues are absolutely stunning. They evoke a sense of motion that is common with the baroque period. Check out Apollo and Daphne, The Rape of Proserpina and David. If your not a fan of great art, you will be after seeing these irresistible masterpieces."

I think it is absolutely impossible to dislike Galleria Borghese, the art gallery housed in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana.First take a stroll through Borghese gardens if the weather is permitted. We were there at the beginning of January, and the weather was absolutely delightful (nice and warm).It is advisable to hire an audio guide if you did not book a guided tour, otherwise you'll miss it. The Galleria contains an amazing collection of paintings, sculpture and antiquities begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese. He was also an early patron of Bernini and collector of works by Caravaggio. That's why, Bernini is so well represented by his famous sculptures like Apollo and Daphne, Rape of Proserpina etc. My daughter absolutely fell in love with his creations - they are so flawless, airy as if they are alive. We were impressed by Bernini's sculptures most of all. Also we really enjoyed paintings by Caravaggio (his Boy with a Basket of Fruit), Titian, Raphael and Rubens. Without doubt, we consider the sculpture of Pauline Bonaparte (sister of Napoleon Bonaparte) to be a pearl of this beautiful collection.There are twenty rooms across two floors, you need to book your visit in advance on-line or by phone, otherwise you will be turned off. No reservation - no entrance, tickets are always sold out. Also you can book the certain time of the day to visit, so plan in advance and enjoy."

Even our teenage daughters enjoyed it (who usually roll their eyes at me when I make them go into yet another museum). The videoguides are worth the investment as well as the signage is pretty much all in Italian. Another perk about going at the opening time is there aren't very many people there; we kept hearing on the audioguide that \"this room will be crowded but still look at ...\" and we never had that problem. You're allowed two hours in the museum and you'll want to stay every minute."

You need to make a reservation and purchase your ticket in advance - at least a week in advance. We arrived by bus, and it was quite easy. It's a quick walk from the bus stop to the museum. (note - we did not see anyplace to eat when we got off the bus, so walked to the museum. The cafeteria in the museum was closed, so we picked up our tickets and then had time to walk through the park to find a cart where we bought sandwiches and sat on a bench enjoying the park. The people watching was top-notch!) This museum is one of those perfect-sized museums. It's big enough to keep you fascinated, but small enough that it's not overwhelming. Get the audio tour and take your time. Tours are timed every couple of hours - so you all enter at once and have a couple of hours to enjoy. You may want to ditch the crowd and go counter-clockwise, or find a way to skip ahead and then backtrack. I didn't know much about Italian art, but after this visit I'm just entranced. Don't miss this collection! By the way - there is an elevator and a staircase - depending on your energy and ability. I think you probably have to take a few steps to get into the building. The gift shop is good - pick up a few postcards to remember the art you loved. You will need to check your bags, coat, etc. so make sure to allow time for that."

Entry to the gallery was also confused with everyone queing to leave their bags upon entrance (none allowed in the building), or queing to pick up their bags upon exit. Everyone working their seemed brusk, not just to us, but others as well.Over rated and rather expensive to visit. If you go, you'll be kind of isolated in that part of town with a long walk or cab to anything else of interest. Rather spend time at central museums or galleries and skip this one.

I just wish someone advised to NOT TAKE THE SUBWAY, the walk is very long and steep UPHILL."

I appreciate the important scupture and painintgs in the Galleria Borgese, but there is also beautiful art in the free churches throughout Rome. You would not expect a museum that requires advance reservations and limits the amount of time you can spend on each floor to be so crowded inside, but it most certainly was on the Sunday afternoon we visited the Borgese Gallery. The museum also makes you check all bags and other items, including small purses and umbrellas. The audio guide that you pay 5 euros for (which I'd recommend having, since not all works in the museum are even labeled) does not match the route you must take inside so you waste time trying to figure out what room you are in and why it does not match up with the start of the audio guide. I found this museum, although beautiful, to be expensive (20 euros) and overrated."

We visited on our last day before treking to the airport. Luckily, we were in Rome during off season and arrived promptly at 9am to the gallery, as a reservation is required. Also, you are given a 2 hour time slot. Others wait until their time slot and the museum is cleared at the end of each. Interesting system; however, it was plenty of time for us as we were leaving anyways. It is not huge in size either, so perhaps they have their system in place with this knowledge. Worth a visit if you have some time to spare and want to fit in a little more art."

We did not buy an audio guide but used Rick Steve's guidebook. Some of the main interests were: Napoleon's sister as Venus, Bernini's interpretation of David, my favorite was Bernini's Apollo and Daphne.

Get an audio guide because there was not written descriptions of the art in this museum. We visited during around Christmas, each visiting group was limited to a two-hour session which was tight if one wished to view all the pieces. We had to skip a lot of the paintings to have enough time to admire the sculptures.Despite the chaos and confusion of the museum operations, Galleria Borghese is a must-see."

This was definitely one of the most spectacular displays of Bernini art located in one place. Although there were quite a few people visiting the gallery, I never had the feeling I was crowded or had to move at a certain pace through the exhibits. I could take as long as I wanted looking at the \"Rape of Persephone\" and other wonderful sculptures and paintings. The setting is beautiful and the display of art spectacular. A 'not to miss' experience if you're ever in Rome. But you have to reserve a date and time online and cannot just show up at the gallery. Also, each visit is a maximum of 2 hours in length which was more than enough time for us to see everything."

We walked through the gardens a bit after our visit and they were beautiful, too. One big hint: we made our reservations online and got a time from 13:00 to 15:00 to visit. We thought that meant to arrive between those two times. No! That was the time we had in the museum! Get there right at the first time given, though you will wait in a line. We missed an hour in the museum because they clear the visitors out for the next group."

            "review": "Well managed part of a lovely day. This ornate museum is situated in a large, beautiful green space that was a 10 Euro taxi ride for us from Trastevere (reasonable and worth it). It is carefully managed from a crowd control point of view (I wish more museums took this approach). You must be there 30 minutes before giving the museum staff time to process your entry which includes: checking all bags and cameras (no photos at all), verifying reservation, buying audiotape if desired...it all takes time but leaves you with the full two hours of viewing time that you are tightly restricted to for the two floors. The Bernini sculptures alone are worth the price of admission. When your two hours are up, you will be almost escorted out to retrieve your bags if you are slow to respond to the announced admonishments to leave. As bossy as the staff are, I think it made for a much more civilized experience where there is room to actually see the art, at a reasonable pace and with enough time to cover everything. After you leave, you can stroll through the park to other museums, eat outside at the Museum of Contemporary Art and make your way out at either the Spanish Steps or the Piazza del Popolo. Rome's upscale shopping area is nearby on Vittorio Veneto and surrounding streets. It's a lovely day!"

I visited Galleria Borghese in mid- October and like most visitors, was blown away by David, Pluto and Proserpina, Apollo and Daphne, etc. There are not enough superlatives to describe the sculptures and art in this exquisite museum. Just reserve your time and go and see for yourself. Tips:Don't wait for that 1/2 hour time slot to pick up your ticket. I arrived 2 1/2 hours beforehand, walked right up to the desk and was able to get my ticket immediately. That gave me plenty of time to enjoy the gardens and browse the gift shop before my prescheduled time. (I purchased the Galleria Borghese red guide book and found it helpful). Half an hour before my reservation time I checked my bag and again there was no line up as everyone else was in line waiting to pick up their ticket.I followed the advice in Rick Steve's Rome tour book and went directly upstairs to the Pinacoteca and stayed for approximately 25 minutes viewing the works of Caravaggio, Raphael and Titian. By the time I got downstairs the crowd was thinning out and I was able to view Bernini's masterpieces and the other amazing sculptures without feeling rushed or having to dodge the crowds. At one point I was the only person in the room admiring David. In fact because of this strategy there was never more than 3 or 4 people at any time when I was looking at Bernini's sculptures and Pauline Borghese. Enjoy!"

Also, it was great that there were so few people allowed in each timed session so it ever became crowded and it felt like you were in a private viewing. The audio guide was 5\u20ac and is worth it as you will learn more than just wandering around. I loved the Bernini sculptures!We booked through tickitaly who took into consideration the timings we could attend the gallery.

After traveling through Italy, starting in Milan to see the last supper and arriving to Rome after having been in Florence, I had my share of the repetitive art themes such as the last supper, the anunciation, the crucifixion, david and goliath etc... Galleria Borghese offered a breath of fresh air. It's a beautiful place and you do have to make reservations. We had the Roma pass which we were able to use. I didn't know what to expect but after having gone, I can't wait to go back. After visiting Italy, I became a fan of Bernini and his statue of Apollo and Daphne is a must see at the Galleria. The fact that your visit is made through reservations is really a benefit and not a disadvantage. It allows you to enjoy it's beautiful are in a quiet setting. You will not be disappointed!"

We had no reservation, and there was no line. The cost was 8 Euros, we spent all the time we wanted and nobody kicked us out, so go in the off season!! That said, it is a fantastic museum.

The frescoes and ornamentation within the museum itself are a glimpse into the wealth of the Borghese family. I would recommend getting an audio guide, which provides many fun facts regarding the various sculptures, paintings and frescoes within the museum--it's a nominal fee of 5 euro. The paintings are worth perusing, but are nowhere near as fantastic as the Bernini sculptures on the first floor. Be sure to make reservations in advance. If possible, get a Roma Pass, which will get you in free, or at least provide a small discount in admission. And bags are not allowed, but there is a free checked bag service. Visits are limited to 2 hour windows, but the entire museum is doable in that time. After your visit, walk the beautiful grounds. There are other museums in close proximity like the museum of contemporary art, as well as the zoo. You can also rent bikes and tool around the grounds, enjoying the lush greenery in the middle of the busy city."

This museum is (imho), all about the Bernini sculpture of Pluto and Prosperina, which is a beautiful piece of sculpture, despite it's violent subject. The two figures are almost alive; Prosperina's fingers and toes and tensed and twisted in horror; they are draped in freshly ironed sheets whose edges are so fine the stone is translucent. The rest of the collection... Some interesting Caravaggios. Some paintings by Bernini, including two self portraits. Some great ceiling paintings.Amazingly opulent decoration of the house itself, reminder of the power and wealth concentrated in the hands of the papal Borghese family, and all that hilariously juxtaposed with the modern day pettiness \"please show your ticket before using the toilet\".Visits are in time slots of two hours, which is plenty of time to see the whole place and linger at the Bernini sculpture."

Then join another queue to purchase the audio tour - for which you have to deposit id (passport!) or the key they've just given you in return for your bags / camera etc,. Then join another queue to actually enter the gallery but there's no checks or screening as far as we could see so people were taking cellphones in. The layout of these different queues is illogical and must be a nightmare in peak season. We visited in December on a Sunday morning and the best advice would be to pick up your tickets and / or arrive on the half hour as I suspect the peak times are on the hourInside the Bernini and other sculptures are superb, the picture galleries less so for me and the building itself with it's ornate decoration are lovely.

The experience is up close and personal, spend the 5 euros for the audio guide it keeps you on track and you learn so much! The audio guide points out the do not miss pieces and provides history along with fun stories; to bring the art to life. Don't miss any of the Bernini pieces especially the \"Appollo e Dafne\" by Gian Lorenzo Bernini - I found the piece amazing!!! Hint: Book online directly with the gallery, I booked from the USA, paid by credit card and just picked up my tickets. After visiting the gallery, ride a bike in the park or take a walk, stop have a sandwich from a vendor.

It was good to be a Borghese - This museum housed in the Borghese villa is chock-full of the art collected (and sometimes outright stolen) by the Borghese family. Don't miss the Caravaggio paintings, especially the one of David holding Goliath's head (Goliath was painted with Caravaggio's face as an apology to the Pope and a request to come home).Apollo and Daphne by Bernini is breathtaking, as the figures seem quite alive.Read Rick Steves' review before you go to get some of the inside scoop, especially thae story behind the nude sculpture of Napoleon's sister.Highly worth the money.Start at the TOP and work your way down the two flights of stairs.Ticket times indicate that is the earliest you can enter. I don't know if they clear the museum after the allotted 2 hours before they let a new group in, but it will take you that long to go through the whole villa. And then there are the gardens...which are free and open to the public. If your feet can handle it, take a tour through those, and note the succulent fruit which still grows there.I think I must have been a Borghese in a former life. I wish, anyway."

So much art and sculpture in such a small building - the rooms are crammed full of paintings and sculptures - including some fantastic prices - it is hard too take so much in in such a small amount of time as visits are strictly limited to 2 hours. It is fairly expensive but we bought a Roma Pass for 30 euros which allowed us to get in here and another site free plus free public transport for 3 days. Guide book says you need to book advance but we didnt - just turned up and they let us in with the next group but we may have been lucky. The groups are only every 2 hours so you could end up waiting a long time if its busy. Also a long walk from the Metro station so recommend getting a bus instead. The park is lovely for a stroll too if you need to kill a couple of hours whilst waiting for the gallery. Or you can hire bikes by the hour. Anyway well worth the money/wait etc as must be one of the best galleries in Europe"

The entry hall is breathtaking,with its beautiful ceiling and mosaics on the floor. The Bernini sculptures are truly wonderful,and incredibly moving. Upstairs are the picture galleries,where Caravaggio's and Raphael's are to be seen. If the queueing system could be refined,and if the cafe had been open,this would have rated an 'excellent'.

Also there is a bit of a rush at the beginning of the two hour session and I sort of panicked a bit and was worried I wouldnt get through everything. But in hindsight 2 hours is plenty of time to head through the galleries, but one suggestion might be to perhaps skip a few rooms at the beginning to get ahead of the crowd, and then come back a bit later once the groups have thinned.

You could spend hours and hours wandering throughout the Galleria, though you are only allowed a maximum of two hours. And, the walk through the beautiful park adds to the whole experience. I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Rome."

We took an audio guide, which was extremely helpful and the way to go. The museum is not too big, so it is not overwhelming. Once you reserve in advance, you are allotted approximately two hours inside the museum, which is sufficient time to get a taste of the outstanding art that resides there. A downside is that no photographs are allowed, but that forced you to focus on the works of art that are there instead of focusing on capturing great shots. A must-do if you're in Rome."

            "review": "Best Example of Renaissance Rome Art Collections and One of World's Best Art Museums. Read the reviews, what can I say. I never miss the Borghese when I am in Rome. This private collection of the Borghese family is like none other. Make a reservation ahead of time and avoid the line and disappointment. I you only go to see the Caravaggios or Berninis it still worth the trip. But if you haven't been there yet, here is what I would say. One, to get the most out of your visit, do some homework first and learn about the history of this unique collection and the magnificent building that houses it. Look at the walls, floor and ceilings, they are as amazing as the art works. Pony up for the guide if you must do it that way but don't just walk in and walk through.The floor in the first salon is covered with ancient mosaics from properties the family owned elsewhere that depict the actual gladiators who fought and died, their names, their sport and whether they lived or died. Many of the salons are completely done in trompe l'oeil, which was very popular at the time the villa was built and the work, which I imagine has been redone over the years, is fabulous.Downstairs is mostly sculpture, and the Bernini collection is the reason for their popularity. (if you have a chance to see the archelogical museum in Naples, the Farnese collection has many wonderful pieces that I can imagine Bernini much have studied and that show the definite precursors of his work.) Also, the Caravaggio's are there.The second floor is mostly painting, but don't miss the little boy and goat in the large salon that is one of Bernini's first pieces.WORD OF ADVICE - GO WITHOUT YOUR BAG, YOU MUST CHECK IT IN AND IT IS A HASSLECAMERA'S - THEY SEEM TO HAVE CHANGED THEIR POLICY ON THIS. I HAVE PHOTOGRAPHED IN THE MUSEUM FOR YEARS WITHOUT FLASH, THE CURRENT POLICY IS NO CAMERAS BUT IT IS NOT WELL POSTED. I WAS ACCOSTED BY AN ANGRY PATRON AS I HAPPILY PHOTOGRAPHED MY FAVORITE DETAILS OF APOLLO AND DAPHNE. MY MESSAGE IS IF YOU REALLY REALLY WANT THE PHOTOGRAPHS FOR YOUR PERSONAL REASONS (I AM A PROFESSIONAL AND ALSO AN ARTIST) BE DISCREET AND CERTAINLY DON'T USE FLASH, USE A SMALL CAMERA OR A SMALLER LENS WITH NO HOOD ON YOUR LARGER CAMERA. IF THE MUSEUM PERSONNEL SAY STOP, STOP. AND IF OTHER PATRONS COMPLAIN BE POLITE AND TELL THEM THE POLICY IS GENTLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COURTEOUS AND DISCREET."

Do get the audio tour, because it will help focus your attention on the more important pieces while at the same time, help you to understand what it took to acquire such a collection. Breathtaking, in a word. We took the 9am tour, and I'm glad we did, because the crowd for the 11am entry seemed to be waiting in a long line.

I'm a 20 year old poor college student and don't fully appreciate art so this was just my opinion. Still beautiful but with all-do respect I'd rather be drinking Italian wine on the Spanish Steps:)"

The first time we just got the audio guide and this time decided to pay one more euro (making it a grand total of 6eu) and do the guided tour. It was fascinating! Our guide had a broad base of knowledge of art in general and an obvious love for the pieces she so eloquently described to us. She taught about the significance of each piece and placed it in an historical setting that helped us sort out and soak in the significance of the contributions of artists such as Caravaggio and Bernini. Note about the Borghese itself. Because they schedule the tours you are never in the midst of a huge crowd. This is refreshing after being in the hustle and bustle of Rome. Also-I suggest taking a taxi ride there but afterwards take time to ramble or picnic in he park. We enjoyed beautiful weather and musicians along with local families taking their kids out for a bike ride. To get back to the city center just exit the park at the end opposite the gallery and look to your left. You will see a portion of the old city wall consisting of one of the entrance gates (which is just an archway) Just through the archway you will come upon the beautiful Via Veneto which you can follow for quite some time or catch a metro to your next destination."

It offers many paintings and sculptures by some of the most celebrated artists of the 16th and 17th century. It is very beautiful. The statue of David by Bernini is one that I remember because of its differences as compared to Michaelangelos David in Florence. In this statue Bernini captures David just as he has released the stone which slew Goliath. The sense of concentration and determination is almost palatable. There is also a wonderful sculpture of Apollo cathing Daphne just as she is turned into a tree. Bernini was also a master working with marble. The first floor are all sculptures,the second floor paintings. Allow yourself at least two to three hours as there is a lot to see. Worth more that the small admision charge.

            "review": "A Great Museum, but be sure to reserve on-line in advance. All of the many wonderful reviews of this museum in a park by other TripAdvisors are absolutely accurate -- it's one of the glories of Rome, and easy to get to: either walk up the Via Veneto to the top of the hill and cross the street (taking your life in your hands, as always in Rome) or take a taxi to the park entrance. Then it's a 10 minute walk inside the park to the museum itself. Do purchase the audio guide; it's good. Be aware of the two hour time limit that keeps the museum from getting too crowded: consider skipping some rooms -- a hard task -- to avoid feeling rushed. Afterwards, we wandered through the park toward the little lake (where you can rent a boat) and chanced upon a lovely little outdoor trattoria where, under big umbrellas, we had a lovely leisurely lunch, reasonably priced. Don't be discouraged by the need to reserve your date and time in advance; this museum is well worth the trouble."

The building itself is beautiful and and it is wonderful how they control the number of visitors so it never feels crowded.

The audio guide for this collection is particularly good and includes interesting stories about some of the prominent artists and pieces.

So much beauty and incredible works of art, with a number of Bernini sculptures and paintings by Caravaggio.

We had 3-5 and were not let in one minute earlier, you also have to check your bags, as there is no photography allowed. There are 2 floors- we went right upstairs and had the place to ourselves. The artwork and rooms are incredible- exquisite paintings, statues and room decorations. Each room has tiled/marble floors and a ceiling painting. The rooms have a theme, the Egyptian room downstairs is a marvel. Eat and drink coffee before you go, then just take your time to enjoy the lifestyle and art of the Borghese family."

It looks like the figures on the ceiling are really supporting the roof like columns.The upper floor of paintings was alright. Not nearly as memorable as the sculptures in my opinion.

To enjoy Bernini's Rape of Persephone alone was worth admission... he made the marble appear like flesh...soft and vunerable... you felt her fear and his rapture... and forgot it was carved in such a cold , hard, medium.Brilliant!Great area to walk & enjoy after as well:)"

            "review": "Great Gallery, Strange Visiting Rules. Galleria Borghese is considered to be one of the best private art collections in the world. It houses works by Raphael, Canova, Bernini, Rubens, Titian, Cranach and Carravagio, and that is why it's a must-see for art-lovers.However, the gallery has, perhaps, the most complicated (not to say stupid) visiting rules among Italian art museums, and I have been to many. These rules look like rules for visiting a prison, not a gallery:1) It's impossible to buy a ticket right there - you need to book it by phone or online at least 1 day ahead. Ordering tickets by phone is convenient, 'cause English-speaking assistance is available.2) Your visit is limited to 2 hours, and that's it. It is also stated, that visitors are allowed to stay at the picture gallery for not more than 30 minutes, which is too little, but I have not seen this to be controlled (doesn't mean it's not, anyway).3) Pre-ordered tickets are to be collected at the museum at least 30 minutes in advance.4) Bags of any size are not allowed inside, so you need to leave them at the locker, that accepts them 20 minutes prior to your visiting time.5) Photography is prohibited.Tickets: 12 EUR, so I'd recommend to include this visit into your Roma Pass (30 EUR, includes visits to any 2 museums + discount to the 3rd museum + unlimited use of public transport in Rome for 3 days; very economical). You'll need to say you're going to pay with a Roma Pass right away, before the cashier would state you're paying with cash, 'cause otherwise the pass would not be accepted.There is a cafe in the ground floor, but it was closed for a while when I was visiting."

We booked in advance and they were booked for several days straight when we arrived. The sculptures are amazing, it is worth it to get an audio guide to help navigate and understand the history. It is disappointing that you can't take photos, in fact you have to check most of your belongings at the front desk. The line-ups were tedious. Still it is interesting to see how much bounty a ruthless pope could beg, extort or steal. He had impeccable taste. Well worth the trip."

The Galleria is situated in the \"Villa Borghese\" (really a huge park with other museums/galleries as well). Maps and signage in the park are not very precise.

We went in the shoulder season. We booked 4 days in advance and when we arrived it was sold out for the next 5 days. You will need to put all your bags in a locker (free) and you cannot take photos. Spaces are booked in two hour slots starting from 9am and you get a max of 30 min in the picture gallery (although I saw no-one get thrown out!). You have to climb a fairly high spiral staircase to get into the picture gallery, but there is a tiny lift if you need it - not obvious, so ask if you need it.We were on a mission to see every Caravaggio in Rome in 4 days and there are at least 5 here. But they are not in the picture gallery - they are on the ground floor in a room of the museum. One of his finest paintings (personal opinion) \"The crucifixion of St Peter\" is just down the hill in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo in Piazza del Popolo, as is his \"Conversion of Saint Paul\" so add that to your day's itinerary. Entry to Santa Maria is free but take some coins for the light boxes. Once again, no photos."

My husband and I have visited this Gallery twice, and were equally awed by the collection the second time as the first. Bernini's sculpture of Apollo and Daphne is stunning, and is very widely admired in the art world. Likewise, his statue of David hurling his slingshot to slay Goliath, Bernini's his \"Rape of Proserpina,\" and Canova's statue of Pauline Bonaparte (Napoleon's sister). I consider the Galleria Borghese to be one of the \"must see's\" in Rome, along with the Forum, the Pantheon, and Piazza Navona.

This is a beautiful private home and collection of some of the most awe-inspiring masterpieces you'll ever find under one roof. Easiest way to get in is to make a reservation online at LEAST 1 week BEFORE - I saw hundreds of frustrated tourists standing around outside, waiting to get in because the Villa was at full occupancy. I bought my ticket online, showed up a 1/2 hour early (make sure you get there at least 30 mins in advance of your scheduled tour time because you still have to wait in line to check in - took me about 20 mins) and I had no issues. Make sure to rent the digital audio guide - it's imperative and you'll be lost without it. And don't \"lolly-gag\" in the rooms (move from room to room at the same pace with the audio guide) as you have a TIMED LIMIT and they enforce it strictly - I was literally ushered out of the building! Also know that you will NOT be allowed entrance with even the tiniest of purses or \"fanny packs\" - so wear a money belt and tuck your credit cards and cash inside because you won't want to leave them at the bag check - plus this was another two annoying lines to wait in to check your bag then retrieve it. You can put your mobile phones in your pocket but you'll NOT be permitted to bring your cameras, so leave your big / good cameras in the hotel along with your purses and backpacks, take a taxi and make a beeline from your hotel to the Villa, and then back to your hotel to retrieve your gear."

If you are late, it eats away your time in the museum.Our first visit was in 2003 during our honeymoon as part of a prearranged tour with a Finnish guide who happened to be well-versed in art history, and this original experience really helped us to appreciate the place also on later visits. So perhaps some kind of guided tour is recommended, although we can't vouch for the quality of the local tours, as we have never been on one.For us the highlights were, usurprisingly, Bernini's \"David\" (the soon to be exploding tension in his pose and grimace), \"Apollo and Daphne\" (the moment of transformation frozen in time) and \"the Rape of Proserpina\" (desperation and the fleshlikeness of marble); and Caravaggio's \"Bacchus\" and \"David with Goliath's Head\". But the place is brimming with interesting and historically important art, so people with more knowledge in those things will be able to enjoy this place even more deeply. However, this is a moving experience even for us laymen, so don't let lack of education to stop you. And of course, reflect on the experience by taking a long walk in the Borghese park. If you need a place where to have lunch before or after the tour, we recommend \"Pomodorino\" very close just inside the City Walls."

Then check you bags (and leave enough time, because the attendants move at their own pace) and get in the entrance queue. Don't miss the Bernini sculptures, especially Daphne and Apollo."

Arrive before your appointed time to avoid standing in line, but after you buy your ticket you'll have to sit and wait until you may enter. The best strategy for seeing everything with the least amount of crowd is to go immediately to the top floor and work backwards. If you rent an audio guide, going to the end first is a bit confusing, but there are numbers on the works of art and those numbers can be entered into the device. Without the audio device you'll simply walk around and look at art, so the small fee to rent the device is well worth it. There are so many pieces to see you will just want to hit the high spots anyway, that is if you are not really into the art. You must check your packs before entering."

I was almost dreading going to another museum during this trip, but I wanted to go during this visit to Rome due to reading such excellent reviews of this site. Every guidebook I read highly recommended it. Most of the reviews on TripAdvisor were great too.Now, I understand why. The musuem contained some of the most gorgous paintings, sculptures, and artworks which are housed in a very lush and gorgeous villa. The floors were exquisite marble. The rooms were so finely decorated that they took my breath away. I was amazed by the art and also by the way it was displayed. It felt much different to me than a normal museum. It was much better and I enjoyed my 2 hours immensely. Also, the audioguide was excellent and I would highly recommend it.There are large lines to get in and also to check your bags. Making advanced reservations for your 2 hour time slot is imperative. But, once inside.... it will all be worth it. Also, make sure to focus on the ground level. We, unfortately, started on the 2nd floor and ran out of time to fully explore the ground level - which is much more impressive."

The building itself it a museum since every single surface is decorated by painting of some kind - faux marbles, trim, wood all look real until you get up close. The art is perfect against this back drop and the audio guide is a good one, focusing on the important pieces with just a little general commentary. The whole tour will just 2 hours and if you go first thing in the morning, there are only about 120+ people there, which is a far cry from the hot and bothered masses at The Vatican. You actually have the space to appreciate everything and can get extremely close to the Bernini sculptures - they are incredible. Give yourself about 35-45 minutes for the paintings and the rest of your time for the sculpture floor. The gift shop is nice with high-quality post cards, which makes up for the fact that there are no cameras allowed in the museum - no bags of any kind are allowed in either - it all has to be checked. Your tickets have to be booked in advance and it does sell out on certain days...be sure to book early. One Warning: for those who may have trouble climbing stairs - the only way up or down is on a very old marble spiral staircase. I counted over 70 steps to the top and I saw several older visitors struggling with the hike. If you think this might be an issue, you might want to check as you first come in RE: any kind of elevator options because there did not seem to be any staff available anywhere to help - this my only negative impression of the museum."

We first came to the Borghese Gallery without having looked it up on Tripadvisor, when we arrived we were told that all the tickets had sold out. Apparently you can't get into the museum without booking in advance. We left and decided to book tickets to return the following week. Upon our arrival at the museum there was a mass of tourists outside, they let people in through two entrances which cause a lot of confusion when there was really only one queue. There is also a time limit of 2 hours in the museum which I feel is too short.Upon entering the museum we found out that we were only permitted 30 minutes in the picture gallery and everyone was lined up to get in to see it. They did not filter people through in small groups but let everyone in at once which causes a small amount of chaos. There are no signs outside saying that you cannot enter the museum without booking in advance. I feel that they should let people know as many people queued a long time only to find out that they couldn't even get tickets at the desk. Also, despite booking in advance, there is a lot of chaos and disorganisation. People at the back of the queue who would have booked in advance but ended up queuing for nearly an hour would have their two hour time quote within the museum cut short.The museum houses Bernini's great sculptures and an impressive collection of marble sculpture. This is what makes the visit worthwhile. The picture gallery is good, but not evocative. However Bernini's statues come alive and are awe inspiring. Bernini is the artist of many sculptural works around Rome including the statues at the Piazza Navone fountains and the Ecstasy of St Theresa. To see his famous Rape of Persephone and Apollo and Daphne and his statue of David is a must when in Rome. Book ahead and be prepared for lots of queuing but this museum is well worth a visit."

Highlights of the collection are breathtaking sculptures by Canova and Bernini, and a handful of Carravagio, Raphael and Titian.The audioguide was one of the best gallery audioguides I've used - interesting, in depth and very informative. I felt that having an audioguide added a lot to my experience. The Borghese requires reservations and I strongly recommend you do so at least a couple of days in advance - we visited on a Tuesday (with a reservation) and the signs said it was booked out until Friday."

Be sure to order your tickets a few days in advance. You can order on-line, or have your hotel help you. You will only have a specific time for your tour. The tours are monitored well and controlled, so please follow the rules. You can lock up your backpack or purse also. A good pause in the gardens after touring the Colosseum and resting for dinner later on in the day. A huge collection of paintings, antique sculptures and it represents the \"golden age\" of the Borghese Family."

The Bernini works were hauntingly beautiful,especially considering his youth when many were done. His David has a look of concentration that is extremely realistic, you can feel his determination. I can't begin to describe Apollo and Daphne, just go see for yourself! The building is a jewel as well, opulent beyond description. I really did love this museum! Now here is why I did not give it a five...Having made my reservations in advance on line, (reservations are a must). I thought my voucher would be my ticket and we could go right in. We still had to wait in line to exchange the voucher for a ticket, then wait in another, much slower, line to check our backpack. Since you are only allotted two hours for the tour, it was annoying to waste so much of it in line. My second issue is that it is over 80 steps to the second floor and you must get a pass from a guide to use the small elevator. I know that it is not easy to retrofit a lift in these old, historic buildings, but since one is ther, why make it difficult to use? Many people have heart conditions or other hidden health issues and should not have to disclose it to use a lift! My last negative has to do with the setting of the museum. Frankly, the park was rather scruffy! Lots of litter, ill kept plantings, and few flowers. The cafe in the park was dirty and the one ladies room that was functional had a long line! In conclusion - definitely go to the museum, but don't waste much time in the park."

Some paintings are easily worth >10M. It isn't the Louvre in terms of volume but it is also less crowded because of their reservations system. I also enjoyed the audioguide (5 euro), which is short, like the museum, but high quality as well. Be ready to spend at least 1 hour here but probably no more than 3 hours. Tips: In order to realistically get in, you must make reservations ahead of time online (what I did) or phone. Bus (or rather mini-bus) 117 takes you there. You can metro it to the Barberini Fountain di Trevi station and then switch to 117 there (1.5 euros for a metro/bus ticket or free if you got the roma pass). Or walk in from the Flaminio Piazza del Popolo (Plaza of the People) metro station and enjoy the park as well (will need at 30 min to walk leisurely there)"

Bernini's Apollo & Daphne, David, and Pluto & Proserpina could easily be the main attractions at three separate museums, and here they are in one building! And Canova's Venus (starring Pauline Bonaparte) sits upon a marble cushion that must be cloth; what genius!This along with classical sculpture (Artemus is one of the only extant Helenistic scultpures), Roman mosaics lifted from an ancient villa, and paintings by Corregio, Titian, Raphael, Rubens and Caravaggio (one of the largest collections anywhere) make the Galleria Borghese a mandatory destination in Rome.Now the mechanics: you must get a reservation first. The Gallery only allows in a limited number every 2 hours so your schedule must adapt to theirs. It is a long walk through the Villa Borghese Gardens so plan ahead--if you're taking a taxi ask for the Borghese Gallery, not the Borghese Villa. Show up early to stand in line to pay for and get your tickets, then stand in another line to check your bags, purses, cameras (NO PHOTOS!), and backpacks. We found two hours to be plenty of time to see all the sights.Time saving tip: when you first enter go up to the top floor and see the paintings. Give yourself 30 minutes, then come down and start at the first sculpture room--by now most of the crowds will have moved on and you'll be able to follow behind the crowds and enjoy your own private viewing of the scultpures. One and a half hours is plenty of time for the sculptures."

They would not let us do this so I think the cat is out of the bag on that one. One hint that may save you some time and avoid confusion if you rent the audio guide (recommended). The audio guide assumes the tour starts by entering the main entrance at the top of the stairs. This was closed and entrance is actually through the door under it. The audio guide hasn't caught up with this change and you'll start out in room #3 instead of #1."

The first thing I want to say is: Be aware that you have to check in your purse or any bag you are carrying. They don't just check the contents. They take the bag and give you a claim check. So, be ready: Take your wallet and eyeglasses out before you get to the counter!! They will give you a little plastic bag to carry them in, but you have to give up your purse or bag. I have seen some comments about purchasing tickets. This was a terrible experience! My sister got in line to purchase tickets for that day, and was told--in a very unfriendly fashion-- that tickets for that entire day were sold out. We were very disappointed, because we were leaving the next day. Just on a whim, my sister suggested that I get on the ticket line myself and try to purchase tickets from the other ticket seller.So, I did. I waited to get the other guy (also having to deal with crazy people pushing, shoving, and cutting in the line) and --lo and behold--I got tickets not only for that day but for the very time that we were there!!! Why? How did this happen? Who knows? I didn't ask the guy; I just paid for the tickets, grateful to be able to get in.So, we then had to get on the bag-check line, which I expected to be security people checking the contents, and I did not expect someone to take my bag .  So I had to quickly get my bag back and pull out my wallet . But in all the confusion, I forgot to pull out my eyeglasses. And, truly, it was unnerving to leave my bag there with my new camera in it. If I had been prepared, it would have been different.The gallery itself and the grounds there are lovely and worth the trip and the aggravation, especially to see the Bernini sculptures. All I can say is--just be prepared for the negative stuff before you can enjoy the amazing art.Another comment: if you take the Metro to the Spagna stop, the signs are NOT CLEAR as to how to get to the actual gallery once you get out of the Metro. You will be near the statue of Goethe, and, if you have a good map, you might be able to figure out where you are. You will eventually find the gallery, of course, but there are no signs until you get to the other side of the park.All in all, it was a lovely park and a lovely gallery, but, as I said, a very negative experience otherwise."

Behind this little door a considerable underground activity takes place.Pre visit:You will need to go through 3 lines (impressively inefficient but who cares\u2026).1.

Deposit your bag in a safe keepingIf you do it line-after-line successively it might take you 30-40 minutes (on September at 11:00am). Therefore it is recommended that your group splits, ideally to 3 teams, to do the 3 lineups in parallel and save a lot of time and frustration.Entering the museum:After standing in the 3 lines proving you are determined to pass al obstacles to get in, a 4th line comes up down there in the basement. The line to get into the museum.Well, the good news is that you can skip this line.Just go out from door #1 (see picture) and climb the steps to the entrance marked with arrow #2.

The presentation of the art is in the Borghese's home which is decorated in ornate style with alabaster and marble panel walls, bas reliefs on the walls and stunning ceiling paintings in each room. It houses Bernini's \"David\" and Carvaggio's \"The Taking of Christ,\" among others. Best of all the museum strictly limits the number of visitors during each 2 hour window. Tours are at 9 am, 1 pm, 3 pm and 5 pm during he week. Check website for schedule. House surrounded by beautiful forest type park and grounds. A true oasis in the city. You must have a confirmed reservation to buy a ticket. It's a hassle, but it is worth every minute and every penny. There is even an antique elevator for use by handicapped people. Staff is very helpful- lovely place all round. Also a very nice museum shop."

The Galleria Borghese collection is superb and the setting couldn't be better in magnificent frescoed or marble-encrusted rooms overlooking the surrounding parklands of the Villa Borghese. Don't miss the Caravaggios, Titian's Sacred and Profane Love and the Bernini sculptures - but that is only a hint of the treasures to be found there. The Bernini sculptures are especially worthwhile since they are best appreciated in the round and Bernini's skill with textures is amazing. Count on a visit of at least two hours. The system of advanced reservations ensures that you don't spend hours in line. One slight critique: the museum could use with a good cafe to rest and refresh yourself."

A mini shrine to Bernini, this personal collection walks you through ancient sculpture, to neo-classicism and then to the majestic baroque; moving, fluttering and eye-dizzying sculptures from the man himself, Bernini. Upstairs is a fine collection of paintings not to be missed either. I started the tour upstairs and saved the downstairs for last (it was less crowded that way) and I saved the best of the collection for last (the Bernini sculptures and the Caravaggio room). Time limit is 2 hours - so use the 90min. audio guide and then spend the last 1/2 hour revisiting your favorite pieces.Have your hotel concierge call and make your reservations the day before. You cannot show up - reservations are required."

Somehow the gallery is a curious place that lies in an awkward location, but it is worth going to visit."

It is only 5 more Euros than the audioguide, but you get tons more info. The guide will leave you with about 30 minutes to explore on your own before your time runs out.

            "review": "DO NOT MISS THIS MUSEUM!. You do not have to be an artist to appreciate fine art. This museum, which is a former residence, is decorated with priceless works of art. The Borghese Family commissioned works for their home from all over the world. These works are all in situ--exactly where and as they have always been. Bernini, Raphael, Caravaggio and Canova are just a few of the more famous artists represented. Be sure to see Bernini's David, Apollo and Daphne and the Rape of Prosperpina. Cardinal Borghese certainly succeeded in creating a \"theater of the universe.\"You must buy tickets ahead for a specific entry time into the Borghese. You are limited to two hours, but I have to say I did not see anyone trying to herd out the previous group before letting the next one in, so, although we left at our appointed time, you may be able to meander a bit longer without being noticed! The tickets were about $13 each and were easy to obtain on the Galleria's website. You bring the printouts with you and exchange them for actual tickets at least 30 minutes before your entry time (because they start to give away unclaimed tickets). This ticket exchange area is below the building and was not marked with any type of signt. We walked right past the stairs going down. As you face the Galleria with your back to the park, you should see a staircase going down directly in front of you. This is where you need to go. There is also a bag check, gift shop and restrooms here. After getting your actual tickets, you can rent an audio guide or sign up for an English speaking tour. We decided to take the tour. It was informative, but I have to say that I had the Rick Steves guidebook with me and the comments the guide made were almost verbatim. So if you have the book, you can simply use that. The ground floor rooms basically connect via a circular shape and are also numbered so it is easy to follow and also easy to locate any of the famous pieces if you know the room number it is in. The guided tour is approximately 90 minutes long, leaving you 30 minutes to stroll on your own and revisit some of your favorites.We could have walked here from our hotel (probably about 25 minutes) but decided to take a cab. We were told to make sure we say \"Galleria Borghese\" and not \"Villa Borghese\" as they are two different things. We did get dropped in the proper location. Afterwards, we got a bite to eat from one of the food carts in the park and enjoyed just sitting in this little piece of heaven in the center of intense Rome. Then, after a bit of searching, we found that there are signs for the Metro/Spanish Steps. This is really an underground tunnel (with shops, etc--it seemed safe to me) allowing you to walk from the edge of the park and then exit at the Spanish Steps. We used this route to get back to our hotel.This is a \"must see\" when in Rome!"

            "review": "Not an Ideal Experience--but Worthwhile Nonetheless. Most of the popular galleries and museums in Rome cope with a major dilemma: how to accommodate huge numbers of guests and offer a worthwhile experience. Officials at the wonderful Galleria Borghese attempt to deal with the problem by limiting the number of people allowed in at any given time. Therefore, it is necessary to book ahead and reserve a two-hour time slot: (9:00-11:00, 11:00-13:00, etc). It is relatively easy to do online at the official website which has a passably good English translation. The entrance fee is 11 Euros. There is an additional 1.50 Euro online fee added to the price of the ticket. Arrive at least 30 minutes before the time you have selected and be prepared for a large number of people in a small space. Leave bags, cameras etc at the hotel. The officials are very strict about making guests check virtually all bags. It's free--but a hassle to drop off and retrieve your belongings. It's a good idea to rent an audio guide. The carefully prepared commentary is helpful. Put simply: there is way too much to see in two hours, so an intelligent guide helps maximize the experience.Like so many other art collectors, both before and after, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, who built the villa, had close connections with the pope and used family wealth and influence to begin to amass a spectacular collection. All the big names are represented--Raphael, Bruegel, Titian, Botticelli, Caravaggio, Rubens--the list is endless. Some magnificent sculpture is to be found, including Bernini's \"Apollo and Daphne.\" With fewer people per square foot than other galleries--the Uffizi in Florence, for example--it is possible to study paintings at leisure. Guests must budget their time, however, since there is a two-hour limit before they must leave! There are guided tour groups to contend with, of course, but they don't seem as irritating as at some other places. Needless-to-say, photos are strictly forbidden. Galleria Borghese is just north of central Rome, so a taxi is the best bet. There is an electric bus (#116) that apparently goes there, but the useless directions from the Tourist Information Office just off Piazza Navona resulted in our taking a taxi out of frustration. About 12 Euros. If you can live with the imposition of a two-hour time limit to see some of the World's great art, the Galleria Borghese is a good way to spend half a day in Rome. The extensive gardens around the gallery are a bonus."

The museum was once a home so it is fun to imagine which room you would have used for your own bedroom. I have visited Rome many times and always had this on my list and finally visited. It is only 7 euro and worth the investment. Then take a stroll in the park and have an espresso to take you on your jouney for the remainder of the day.

Since the admissions are limited, it never felt crowded or rushed and I was able to go back and admire certain pieces over and over. After leaving the gallery we enjoyed the serene setting of the Villa Borghese, which is a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the city."

Organising this visit well in advance is well worth all the effort - Bernini's sculptures simply have to be seen to be believed.If you're not intending to spend the full two hours allotted in the museum you'll probably find the rooms are less crowded, if you com half an hour later. If you pick up the tickets an hour in advance you have 90 minutes to have a stroll round the wonderful park beforehand.If you come by public bus it's worth finding out the name of the nearest bus stop in advance as the villa was not indicated on the route we took. Our stop was in the Via Po and we still had to go round a couple of corners to find the entrance to the park.The route back to the town centre is nearly all downhill."

We only went to this museum because it was a Fodors Choice museum -- none of our friends had mentioned it -- I cannot tell you how much we enjoyed this museum. The collection is in a spectacular villa built for Cardinal Borghese in 1615 - so part of the visit is getting a chance to enjoy this beautiful building. The many Bernini works are breathtaking - especially the statue of Apollo and Daphne -- our family favorite. There are also many fabulous works by Titian, Caravaggio and Raphael. The nice thing is the size -- it is a perfect size -- especially if you have kids. You need to make advance reservations for a two hour time slot so it is not too crowded. We used our Romapass to get in. All four of our children enjoyed this museum --it is not as overwhelming as many, not as crowded and you an get quite close to the art which is nice. It is also located in the Borghese Gardens which is a nice relaxing area apart from the craziness of the rest of Rome."

Of all the art that I saw in Italy, of all the paintings, the statues, and the grand churches - none touched me like Apollo and Daphne in the Borghese Gallery. We made reservations online several weeks before our visit to Rome and I was most interested to see Bernini's David - I mean the arrogance of this man - to have seen Michelangelo's David and then to make a David of your own. The confidence to do this , I thought, shows a strong belief in yourself - was it warranted?Well - his David is good. Styled after himself and more Baroque than not, it captures the imagination but did not take my breath away. No, that happened when I entered the room where Apollo was reaching for Daphne. This statue - it cant be made of marble - it is time, it is space, it is movement -- Anyway I kept wandering back to stare again. I left the Galleria Borghese a Bernini fan - not for his David - for his artistry and skill. I guess his ego was justified."

It was actually off the map as it is further away from the city center than we realized. We got to the place 30 minutes late and the guy at the desk was very rude. He said that we were late and he cannot let us in. After I explained the story that we got lost, he told us to come a couple hours later at 5pm and that \"maybe\" we could be admitted into the museum. We came back to the museum and there was a long line, but made it to the desk by 4:50pm as we did not want to be late again! He told us that it was not 5:00pm yet and that we had to come back in 10 minutes. At this point we were so frustrated and almost left, but we are so glad we didn't! The museum is amazing and I defnitely suggest getting the audio guide!All in all, DO NOT be late for your reservation.

Each room is breathtaking in and of itself and you really get to see the art in the setting for which it was made. Truly a trip into the past. Two tips: first, you have to reserve ahead (which although a bit of a bother is well worth the smaller crowds). Reservations are easily done online or by phone. Second, get the audio guide.

If you don't have reservations, then show up 10 minutes before an admission time (every two hours another admission, limited to 200). At that time unclaimed reservations are released. After two hours the gallery is cleared of visitors, so make good use of your time. Here is where you go for sculpture by Bernini, as well as the Canova Pauline Bonaparte. Tip: As people go in, they tend to linger around the sculpture, which one comes to first. Thus the sculpture galleries are crowded early in the 2-hour visiting period. Instead of doing this, go directly to the paintings one floor above. These galleries will be nearly empty while everyone is crowded around the Canova and Bernini, then after seeing the paintings, go down to the sculpture rooms which will be rather empty of visitors. Don't linger much in front of anything, though you will want to. Two hours is not enough, in my opinion, for this place. You will want to go back."

You don't really need to pay for skip the line tickets for this museum as they only admit 360 people in at each 2hour time slot, yes you only get 2 hours in the museum, but this is plenty of time. Just make sure you book on your first day in Rome as the there are only 5 session times. The quietest session if the 5pm one. We booked on line and it was very simple and only cost 12Euro. We also hired the audio guide which was invaluable. This museum houses a variety of Bernini statues, one of which is his David. This is the most remarkable statue and very different to the Michaelangelo David. The museum also has some wonderful Caravaggios and many other beautifulworks of art. The building itself is also worth visit. Definitely a must see when in Rome. After your tour of the museum make sure you stroll through the beaufiful Borghese Gardens, very peaceful and relaxing."

My family arrived a while before our reservation time (reservations are required for visiting this museum) so we took a fun bike ride through the gardens. The museum itself made me feel gypped. It was only two relatively small floors of art and the reservations for 5 people cost upwards of 60 euros. Borghese had a few famous sculptures and paintings and the rest of it was pretty lame. It took about 45 minutes to cover the whole museum. The highlight of Borghese was the cafe. I bought a donut there and it was HEAVENLY, so I bought a second one. Honestly, THE BEST DONUT EVER!!! I would actually recommend you to visit Borghese just to eat a donut. The donut was fairly priced too. I LOVE BORGHESE...donuts!!!!!"

I had read that this is one of the most beautiful museums in the world, housed in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana that was built in the early 1600\u2019s, so decided that I had to go on this 2nd trip to Rome to do something different this time around. Warning, you must really plan ahead and reserve in advance online in order not to miss out. Reservations are by two-hour blocks so choose wisely and give yourself plenty of time to get there especially if you take the metro. The Villa Borghese Park is huge and it is a good hike to get to the Galleria through the park, about 20-30 minutes, plus you need to arrive 30 minutes ahead of the time block you have reserved. If you are in a hurry, or do not want to walk up from the metro, then it is advisable to take a taxi. However, the park is lovely and does deserve some time spent there. Once inside the Galleria you must turn over everything to the obligatory baggage check, including phones, cameras and small purses. Just don\u2019t forget to pull out your ID and some cash first, so that you can rent the audio guide (highly recommended to get the most out of the visit) or buy a snack at the snack bar while you wait for your time block to start. It seems that most people start on the lower level, so I advise starting at the first floor where all of the paintings are. It will be quiet and you\u2019ll feel like you almost have the place to yourself. Then once everyone starts coming upstairs you\u2019ll go down and do the lower level and feel like you have the place almost to yourself. I actually found myself alone a few times in some of the rooms, which was a great experience. I appreciate all art and while I enjoyed the paintings upstairs I absolutely loved the marble sculptures and the rooms downstairs more. The whole place is absolutely breathtaking, so ornate and with so many details to admire. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of Bernini\u2019s Apollo and Daphne sculpture, which is truly exquisite. Canova\u2019s Pauline Bonaparte as Venus Victrix marble sculpture was another stunning piece that I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of. I was a bit worried that 2 hours would not be enough time here but I had time to go back and see favorite sculptures a few times and didn\u2019t feel rushed. If there is one frustrating thing, it is that no photos are allowed inside to immortalize your visit. A small consolation is to buy a book or some postcards at the small bookshop on your way out."

All 18th century's art decor techniques were used in this villa. Yellow marble was also used in the decor. Many other famous Italian artists' artifacts are among the collection.Tips: buy Roma pass, and call the Gallery's reservation line to set up your visiting appointment."

Because the Galleria Borghese requires a reservation and limits each visitor to two hours, one can enjoy the museum in a way one can't most others. To be able to take the time to really enjoy each piece of art without large crowds is a treat indeed. Not only is the Galleria the home to some of the most amazing Bernini sculptures and paintings by Titian, it is set in a beautiful park. Be aware that you are required to check all of your belongings, including purses, cameras and phones, before entering the Galleria. Although we had no problems, it did make me a little nervous, and I might have brought less with me that day had I known that in advance."

They require all bags, cameras, etc. to be checked...nice to know this ahead of time. The museum itself is two floors of paintings and sculptures, which you have 2 hours to explore. There is a nice gift shop and snack bar as well. The little tourist train around the grounds is a fun way to see how huge this public park is, and what else is there to visit if you have time.

First of all, you MUST call and reserve your appointment time. I would do this a least a week in advance - probably two.Give yourself sufficient time to reach the gallery. It is a little out of the way, and if you are walking and rushing, you will show up a hot sweaty mess. You also should aim to arrive 30 minutes before your appointment time. If you have any bags, it must be checked - again give yourself time to do this. How important is making your appointment time? You only have 2 hours in the gallery. After that everyone is thrown out to make room for the next appointment time. So do not be late. Get the audioguide. It will focus on many of the best pieces in the gallery - usually 1-3 per room. You just punch in the number and listen. At first you may be not sure what room you are in, but just be patient, you will figure it out. As the guide it talking about the room and/or artwork, you can also check out the other pieces in the room.Two hours is the right amount of time. When you are finished, use the bathrooms and check out the gift shop. The gallery is in the park, and if you prepared a lunch you can go find a nice spot on the grass and relax and eat (weather depending of course). Overall - wonderful gallery of paintings and sculpture.Check out this site for a sample of what you can see, but of course seeing the pictures online is nothing like seeing them in person:http://www.galleriaborghese.it/borghese/en/edefault.htmI hope this helps"

Secondly, some of the pictures are great to see. (As any art student will know there are some genuine and iconic old friends here including examples by Caravaggio, Cranach, Titian and Fra Bartolomeo). To my taste though too many are over-cleaned. But save yourself for the sculpture. Yes, there's Canova's beautiful and daring portrait of Paolina Borghese, but the absolute stars of the show are the group of Berninis which are utterly breathtaking. I could have spent hours - unfortunately you only have two hours to see the whole museum - with the stunning depiction of Apollo and Daphne: for the chance of seeing that sculpture alone you have justified the price of your admission."

The Bernini sculptures alone are worth the price of admission. The best thing is that, because you must have a reservation to enter, only about 300 people are allowed in the gallery at a time. This leaves plenty of room to ponder the genius of the artists represented here. You could walk around the various Berninis to see these magnificent pieces as theyt should be seen - in the round.

Once we walked through the main doors we were in awe of all that we saw. A more quiet place to visit so save it for a day when you need a break. I loved it so much when I got back to the states I bought a book about it since the store was closed when we finished our tour. If I ever get back to Rome I would go here once again."

The Borghese Gallery is within the Villa Borghese gardens and contains the Borghese collection of paintings, sculpture and antiquities, begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope Paul V (1605\u20131621). The Villa was built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio from sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a party villa at the edge of Rome. Scipione Borghese was an early patron of Bernini and collector of works by Caravaggio, who is well represented in the collection. Other paintings include Titian's Sacred and Profane Love, Raphael's Entombment of Christ and works by Peter Paul Rubens and Federico Barocci. The Gallery contains many works by Bernini including the famous Apollo and Daphne. I ran 8 to 12 miles per day in the Borghese gardens surrounding the Gallery and met many local Italian runners there."

It's hard to find, but does exist for people who honestly have conditions that interfere with walking. Also, follow the instructions on your ticket - arrive early as you will have to get checked in, then turn ALL your belongings that don't fit in a pocket into the lockers.

We did not make reservations before we left for Italy, but on our first day there we went straight to the museum and were told we could make reservations for the next day.

We went on recommendation from our friends and really had our doubts before we got in, especially since it's about 12 euros a ticket. It was one of our favorite places in Rome, we are really glad we went! It was neat because the rooms are organized very well and each room is an artwork, really. The ceilings, sculptures, and paintings in every room are pretty much themed. There are some laminated guide papers in each room to give you a little history of the artwork--we were fine without an official guide, all of it was fascinating. My husband usually isn't into artwork and was very enthusiastic about Bernini! We are SO glad we went. If you go, you'll probably be glad you did too and will not regret it. Word of caution: you have a 2 hour time limit (they let you in at your reservation time, and kick you out promptly 2 hours later). It came fast for my husband and me, we really ahd to pace ourselves in the rooms and be strategic to avoid large tour groups and crowds. But it was amazing!"

THis was the home of cardinal Scipione Borghese, the greatest art collector of his time and the collection was greatly enlarged by his acquisitions and has been added to down the years. THis jewel of a museum is the only must -see museum of Rome and can be done even if you've only got one day in the city, but you must book online at least three days ahead, much earlier than that for peak season between April and October. Takes 2 hrs to see, (they push you after that, to bring in more people), arrive at least a half hour before your ticket time in order to pay your reservations and leave your bags and packs and coats , cameras, too, at the wardrobe. Two floors of marbles, bronzes , paintings and mosaics, the best representative of Italian art there is, followed by the Capitoline Museum collection, which also has many, many Roman statues and 2.000 yrs of Italic art. Stop afterwards in the Villa Borghese city park, the best city park of Rome, you can cross the park over to Via Veneto or to the PIazzale delle Belle Arti, where the Modern Art Museum is."

We hired audio guides , which are very clear and made our way through the various rooms. The highlight for me, as for many others is undoubtedly Canova\u2019s statute of Pauline Bonaparte as Venus, this is absolutely stunning. The museum is packed full of statues and pictures, it is all very well displayed and it is amazing that so much art is in one relatively small place.The fact that you have to book in advance means that it does not get too crowded. It is also very easy to navigate round.We had a quick bite to eat in the caf\u00e9 and then headed into the park. We hired a 5 seater bike and we had fun riding through the park for an hour or so. It was a welcome break from all the culture of the last few days and we had great views over the City."

Make a reservation for the latest time available and you'll be more likely to have priviate indivduals touring with you rather than packs of tour groups. As others have mentioned, it is quite a hike to the museum so give yourself plenty of time if you are walking and you will be rewarded with the absolute best of sculpture in the world. Canova's beautiful Paolina is amazing. Bernini's talent can not be overstated, and his work, done in his 20's is breathtaking (what were YOU doing in your 20's??). The museum's limitation on numbers of visitors provides everyone with an opportunity to truely enjoy the works. There are also fabulous rooms painted on literally every surface and oil paintings by masters, but the sculpture is the star here."

We also reserved our tickets online before our departure from the US to get the specific time slot and day. Cameras are not allowed and we had to leave ours at the cloakroom - it was safe. Highly recommend this museum!"

What a vast historical perspective, especially on the Renaissance artists including Michaelangelo, with this visit to the home of the once high powered Cardinal whose only goal was to obtain the best European art pieces at that time! We obtained a private guide who made the art come to life. What was so nice is that we could listen to her while gazing at the various pieces - this made it all so much more enjoyable. Make sure to pay for a discount to most museums/galleries by pre-purchasing online and picking the pass up at Leonardo Da Vinci Airpot."

We started our day walking from central Rome through the south entrance of the gardens. The gardens themselves are lovely. A nice quiet oasis in the middle of a bustling city. Since it was a weekend, there were plenty of families strolling through the park. The museum itself is a must. The Bernini sculptures are AMAZING! Although maybe not as massive in size compared to David or other sculptures, the details in these pieces really tell a story. Look for the laminated \"placemats\" in each of the rooms (available in multiple languages) to give you a brief summary of the pieces in the room. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Rome."

It was built to be a museum and it is made up of several 'salons' many of which have a Bernini sculpture in the center of the room that sets the stage for the 'decor' of the entire room.Only thing I don't understand is why the Italians are so bad at lighting art! There are some pieces that are very difficult to view becaause there is a big spot light on it."

We aren't huge art lovers, but we do have an appreciation for the amount of work and effort that goes into making a painting or sculpture. Perhaps since we spent the morning with a private guide in the Vatican Museum, we were tired of Art for the day. Or perhaps it was the price and hype for the place and then we were let down with the dry audio guide, amount of people and small space.Things to know: You do have to make reservations. Bag check is mandatory and yes, that means your purse too. It is extra for an audio guide and you need to leave an ID with them.Otherwise, the park and surroundings are beautiful.

The Borgheses were great patrons of the sculptor Bernini and the painter Carvaggio- two of Italy's finest artists. As you walk through each room you would think that Apollo and Daphne are in reality running ahead of you, but really its just a statue in the middle of the dining room. Might be my favorite museum in all of Rome, has an extensive and beautiful collection, yet small and intimate enough to have your time with each piece. Highly recommended."

Carefully plan out your visit, making note of all aspects to your arrival at this museum, and you will have a much more enjoyable experience.That said, the walk path I used to get to this museum took me up the Spanish Steps, which you could become easily distracted with as it is not only a well functioning water feature, the people watching is very rich!

There are so many amazing things to see. You can get really close to the art to get inside of the spirit of the artist and truly appreciate the fine work. The place is packed with amazing objects. I was thrilled and saturated by the sights. Our 2-hour time slot flew by. I would go back in an instant."

(Photos are not allowed inside. Boo. Hiss.) First off, we toured the Pinoteca. (Go straight to the upper floors to avoid all the crowds on the first floor). Cardinal Borghese, though not an overly religious man, was the nephew of the pope. He was wealthy enough to amass quite an art collection, and much of it is religious in nature. After exploring the beautiful works in the Pinoteca, we headed for the amazing sculpture and Caravaggios on the first floor. I LOVED Bernini's Apollo and Daphne. I thought it was the best sculpture we saw on our entire trip to Rome. (And we went to ALOT of museums.) The stone of Apollo's cloak and Daphne's leaves was translucent; I can't believe stone can be carved like that. Also flabbergasting is the fact that the statue has remained so perfectly intact all of these years. Clearly, it's always been someone's treasured possession. Bernini's Rape of Proserpine was also gorgeous, and my husband loved Bernini's David, also a standout of this collection."

One can't consider a trip to Rome complete without a visit here. The Bernini sculptures are worth the price of admission alone.

The Galleria Borghese (8.50 Euro per person) is often called the Queen of private collections and for good reason. Here you find approximately twenty rooms, of various size, spread out over two floors, each featuring very special and impressive works of art and/or sculpture from the likes of Bernini, Caravaggio, Ruebens, Titan and Raphael. There are so many pieces of sublime excellence here, its difficult to process all that you are seeing. When you visit, just take your time! Also, compared to other world class museums, which are often quite monstrous in size, the Galleria Borghese is much more manageable since it housed in a smaller building and spread across just twenty or so rooms. This means you can have a quality experience here but not have to invest a full day of your time. For those pressed for time in Rome, you can see most of the collection in perhaps as little as just 45-60 minutes, or you can stick around and spent hours appreciating and enjoying what you can see here. The Galleria Borghese is located in the impressive Villa Borghese grounds, which are also worthy of an hour or two of your time. Collectively, they make an outstanding way to spend an afternoon in Rome. We suggest visiting the Galleria first thing after lunch and then spending the rest of the evening strolling through the Villa in the direction of Piazza del Popolo where you can find nice hillside views of the city of Rome. Overall, the Galleria Borghese is a magnificent attraction, well deserving of raving reviews which it so regularly receives. It is a place we have visited numerous times and will happily return to with anticipation for the numerous masterpieces which are to be found here. This is just one of those very special places and a very top attraction in the city of Rome, particularly for art and sculpture lovers."

If you are interested in the history of the art and home but don\u2019t want to pay extra for the tour guide or audio tour I recommend either the Eye Witness Rome Top Ten book or download the Rick Steve\u2019s podcast. Both are excellent. This museum is part of the ROMA pass system so if you are seeing all the sites in Rome, I recommend the pass; it will save you time and money.

You see how Raffael brought structure and expression, Carravaggio brought light to the colours of black, red and white and Bernini seemed to soften marble so that the flesh appears to be pressed in.And save for last the Bernini statue (only his genius could have done it) of the condemned girl transforming into an oak tree whilst being held by her unbelieving young lover.The Borghese family & Popes may have been amongst the most corrupt but their Villa, their museums, their gardens, their pilfered art collections are truly beautiful."

The tour is only 2 hours and you have to make reservations several days in advance (even during the off-season), but it is totally worth it. I would not recommend a guided tour, just because there is not a lot of time to move through all the galleries. I would recommend renting an audioguide though (5 euro apiece) as it will tell you about the highlights. Please make sure you get the one with a full battery - we had to waste our precious time on the exchange."

We had tried to book online for the Galleria Borghese from South Africa, as we had heard that it was essential to have a booking as they only allow a certain amount of people in for a certain amount of time, but we had been unsuccessful. Our hotel manager tried to book for us but was told they only had bookings available for Tuesday (too late for us), however he told us to take a chance and just go there as sometimes people did not arrive for their tour. We decided to do this the next morning.We walked maybe a kilometre from our hotel to the Villa Borghese. It is the most stunning building from the outside, and yes, we asked if there were cancellations and they said yes, so again we used our Roma card and saved ourselves the entrance fee of \u20ac8.50 and didn\u2019t have to pay the booking fee of \u20ac6.They are absolutely right when the say it is the most splendiferous palace in Italy. The art and statues are unbelievable. The statue that impressed us the most was of Pauline Bonaparte reclining on a couch. It is carved out of marble of course, but it looks so real and so soft that we felt if we touched it, it would dent under the pressure of our fingers. We had a giggle at the description in the book we had purchases at the gift shop that read, that when she was asked by her peers how she could have posed in the nude, she answered \u201cit wasn\u2019t too bad, they had heating\u201d. Another incredible statue is of Marcus Curtius on his horse flinging himself in a chasm (who knows why?), how this statue seems to emerge from the wall and remain suspended almost in midair is a marvel to behold.There are masterpieces by Caravaggio, Rubens, Titian and paintings and statues by Bernini and of course then there are those by Raphael especially (one of my favourites) Lady with a unicorn.Do not miss this gallery, even if you are not well versed in the arts, the sheer beauty of the paintings and statues will take your breath away.When we had had our fill of art we strolled through the beautiful gardens admiring the fountains and yet more statues and then went on our way to explore yet more wonders of Rome."

Galleria Borghese is a must for Rome--beautiful paintings, sculptures and frescoes in an intimate environment nestled in a beautiful park. Its an easy walk from Piazza di Spagna and the park provides a great opportunity to have a picnic or to relax. No pictures are allowed in the gallery--so you will have to check your purse and belongings at the door. The tickets are only good for two hours--and you are only allowed in during that time--they are quite strict about the timing. I recommend starting upstairs to avoid the larger tour groups and going during the weekday if possible. There is a gift shop, cafe and clean restrooms on the ground floor."

I saw one inside the museum, but it wasn't working, so it's best to stand near the lowest door of the museum and get inside first as the line is very slow-going. The doors open 30 minutes before your reservation time. Getting to the gardens and the museum is a bit of a trek- about 15 minutes on foot from the Spanish Steps. We brought a picnic and got to the park an hour early. Allow for plenty of time so you don't feel rushed."

And don't miss the paintings and sculptures upstairs - they do have some of the best well-known works. We take all our visitors to Rome there, amd every one has rated it hghly. The Bernini's are exquisite and look out for the Roman hermaphrodite and compare the drapings with the Canova. Don't forget that Scipione who built it took all the best mosaics and statues left from Roman times, employed the best artisans of the time and put all the best works here as his showpiece, so it is quite stunning. Check the Gallery's website and ring for a ticket in advance - you have to arrive half an hour before the appointment time to pick up the ticket, giving you time to have a coffee or drink in their very pleasant cafe befoe going in."

Consumers, watch out for the SCAM via UNFAIR practices by the Borghese Gallery when purchasing tickets online. We attempted to buy the tickets (family of 4) online at their website from the USA but got no confirmation or email. So, we tried again and still the same - no confirmation or email confirmation reply. We tried one last time and still the same results. When we got to Rome, we purchased ROMA Passes which included entry to the Borghese Gallery. Upon arriving at the Borghese Gallery, we advised the ticket clerk that we attempted to buy the tickets online 3 times with no luck. She (Christina) stated that we do in fact have a reservation, 3 of them and thus 3 charges. We asked for an adjustment refund for the extra 2 charges explaining what happened. She began to argue with us rudely saying that they do not give refunds, that all purchases are final, regardless of whether we got confirmations. I summarized to Christina that her position on behalf of the Borghese Gallery is that they are knowingly charging us 2 extra times ($75.82 and $75.82) even though we are only here once - she did not disagree and offered no other response. We also took it up with their website contact and were given the same response. We disputed the extra charges with our bank (Bank of America) explaining the entire situation and are awaiting final disposition, but their initial response was that the \"charges are considered valid\". Gosh, what an UNFAIR situation to the consumer!!!!"

However the true spectacle of the villa is that it was designed by the leading artists and architects of the day, and the rooms are left (mostly) as they were intended to be. The interpretation perfectly corresponds with the masterpieces of sculpture and painting, simply because the art was made to grace the rooms, and the rooms to complement the art. Submerse yourself here for 2 hours - then you have to leave to make room for the next entry. But those 2 hours will be well remembered."

I was told to return then, which I duly did, then was told that I wouldn't be able to get in until the following morning. I'm really glad I didn't give up on the gallery, because it was entirely worth the wait. The Berninis and Caravaggios alone made the visit worth it, not to mention all the other wonderful art. In addition, there was a special exhibit with the classical pieces that had been sold to the Louvre by Camilo Borghese, Pauline Bonaparte's husband, making their first return in more than 200 years, and in their original locations in the gallery! A few wonderful things about the gallery: 1. access is through a timed ticket, with a limited number of people available in the gallery, which makes it much easier to enjoy the art as there aren't mobs of people in there. 2. even though you only are allowed two hours in the gallery, it's enough time to see everything and do it justice. 3. No photography is allowed, so everyone simply had to look at the pictures/sculptures and enjoy them, instead of just snapping a photo and moving on. 4. It's situated in the beautiful and peaceful Borghese Gardens, a large park which, when you're in the heart of it, hardly seems like it's in the middle of a busy city. It's especially wonderful in the early morning when the only other people there are joggers."

You will appreciate the fact that the admit only limited numbers of people at one time. It allows for a much more enjoyable viewing experience than, say, the Vatican Museum. Unlike the Vatican, a guided tour isn't necessary, but the audio tour was very good (just don't let your 13 yr old son swing the handset by its strap in the bust gallery - the strap comes off - but don't worry...nothing broke). And the Borghese Gardens around the gallery make for a nice walk afterwards. In my opinion, this is an absolute must see while in Rome."

I became a Bernini lover, and wanted to see everything he did for the rest of the trip...even hauled a HUGE Bernini art book all the way home. I almost skipped the Borghese but it was one of my favorites and when I am back in Rome I will visit again. We walked around Villa Borghese afterwards...beautiful place also, even has a zoo.

You are limited to only 2 hours at a time. The museum actually makes you wait and line up in the lobby until your appointed time to let you in. You need to check your bags in. I wished it was a bit longer but it was enough to at least get a brief primer of the major pieces of art there. Because of the popularity of this museum, the crowds is still quite sizable. I would recommend going upstairs first when you enter before coming downstairs to finish up the rest of the exhibits. Most of the crowd floods into the first floor when you first get in and you won't get much of a view. I wouldn't spend more than 45 minutes upstairs as the most important art work are downstairs."

What I didn't like: after getting your ticket, you MUST take your bags to the cloakroom, however, you can take everything out of yours bags and put them into one. It's rather strange. Once inside though...What I did like: the detailed summaries of each room on only one placard. Learning something new....that Bonaparte had ties to the Borghese family and that interesting history that goes along with that. And lastly, the Barberini sculptures...well, you'll just have to see for yourself...it kind of blows your mind the detail he was able to create.On a side note: at the bottom of the gardens there is a Cafe. It's part of the cinema. We stumbled across it and had the most delicious buffet for only 25 euros each (including dessert and drinks...bottled water and wine)"

This museum is very strict on the number of people who are in the museum at any one time and how much time they can spend in the museum. We ended up taking a tour which I think would be the best way to visit the museum, as you hit the major pieces and get the stories around them as well. We used Dark Rome tours and paid around $60 a person that also included a walk around the gardens too (FYI I think tickets are 9 euro a person and 5 euro for an augioguide if you want to try it on your own). One important thing to notwe is that tickets do sell out, so if you want to do it on your own be sure to reserve them in advance. My favorite were the four Bernini sculptures in the Borghese, and after visiting Florence and seeing many Michalangelo sculptures, Bernini is still the best. It is just amazing what he did with pieces of marble, my favorite sculpture was Pluto and Proserpina. There are also several Caravaggio paintings along with some Rubens and a Raphael. Overall a great collection and we really enjoyed the time we spent there. Important to note it is forbidden to take pictures in the museum which is a shame. In our whole trip we learned that many museums \"forbid pictures\" but in pretty much all cases it is bc of merchandizing, and in almost all of them you can still take picutres, you just need to be sly about it and do no flash. This museum has people in every room and I wouldn't reccamend trying to take any pictures here."

Especially if you have a reservation later than 9 AM. It took us till almost 9 to walk all the way up to the gallery, and then we were quite confused as to where to go once we had our tickets. The tickets advise that entry is on the second floor, which makes you think to go back outside and up the stairs to what appears to be the second-floor (as multiple people were doing at 9 when we were there). This is not correct. The guided tours start downstairs where you get your tickets, next to where you pick up the audio guides (which is in the adjoining room to where you pick up tickets with reservations). Also, once you have figured this all out, you need to proceed to the checking counter and have them lock-up all bags, cameras, phones, etc before you can go on the tour. This gets VERY backed up, especially after 9AM, so allow extra time for this. At any rate, we were quite confused and had little time to figure this all out, so we missed the start of the guided tour and were on our own to explore the museum. Tip 2 = bring a watch. You are allowed two hours inside the museum with no clocks to be found anywhere, and they have you check your phones and cameras when you arrive. A watch is a smart choice here! We were left guessing, though somehow managed to finish up around 4 minutes before we needed to leave. Even without the guided tour or the audio guide, it was a very enjoyable visit. They have sheets of information in every room to tell you about the art within that room, so pick one of those up when you enter each room if you don\u2019t have a tour. All that being said, I cannot describe how stellar this museum is. Simply breathtaking. Not to be missed! Just leave yourself plenty of time beforehand!"

Fortunately, my wife wanted to go, and I requested our hotel to book us for 3:00 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. We took the subway to the piazza on the west end of the Borghese Park, and decided to stroll our way across the entire park to arrive at the gallery. It was such a lovely day, and we enjoyed seeing all the local people enjoying their park with families. Lots of kids playing, picnics, and bicycle carriages that you could share with 4 to 6 people, rolling throughout the park. Then when we got to the gallery, it was an easy check-in. We then realized we were at one of the most incredible art collections in the world. The facility is very doable in 2 hours, but if you are an art buff, you'll want to go back for more. If you are going in high tourist season, you best book weeks ahead. It is an art pilgrimage worth trekking to, and the Carravagio paintings and Bellini sculptures will blow you away!"

They had closed off a main part of an exceptional room because a large crew was filming some sort of restauration on a scultpure. Why didn't they do this after hours? Please reduce the cost of the admision or advise your visitors as this had an impact on our visit."

Make sure you get the audio, it makes is so much more interesting as things are explained. Some really beautiful pieces here. Afterwards you have the whole grounds to explore, including the zoo. My wife and I rented a bike and we were able to explore the whole area. I feel my review doesn't give this place the great review it deserves. But this place was #1 of our Rome trip"

The Galleria is quite impressive and is probably a must for the art lovers. However, I can't say it would fit even my top 10 must see spots for the casual tourist trying to get a taste of Rome."

Gardens are vast & the Galleria Borghese tucked away in one corner. We pre-booked through the hotel concierge - you cannot just arrive & hope to get in. November is hardly high season & our 'group' at one in the afternoon was quite substantial. I assume in July, August, September you would want to book as early as you could. One other point to note: you basically cannot take anything but yourself inside the building - everything must be left at the cloak room. On the day we visited many people were barred entrance (after waiting in the queue) because they hadn't checked their belongings in. As far as we could see there was no noticeable sign on the exterior of the building, and as the entrance to the gallery is at ground level & the cloakroom at basement there is no great connection between the two. So. The gallery. I think it would be well worth the admittance just to see the two major Bernini sculptures. Both works: Proserpina being abducted by Pluto, and Daphne escaping Apollo are really tour-de-forces. My partner does not claim any deep artistic taste & was blown away by the Berninis. I have seen them previously only as images in books - this was definitely a case of the real thing being miles better than any image could hope to convey.Canova's saucy statue of Napoleon's sister is not too shabby either...One of the major Caravaggio's was on loan to Moscow, but there was plenty else to catch your attention - not forgetting the building itself: it is almost impossibly decorated - like a mini-Versailles.Plenty of 'biggies' to be seen: Raphael, Titian, Rubens, Coreggio. My favourite though was probably the beautiful Cranach work of Venus & Cupid.The pluses I saw were that allowing people in at specific times & in specific sized groups meant that you did not feel that awful crush of bodies that ruins so many galleries. I also thought the relatively small size of the gallery meant a less frenetic attitude to 'getting everything in'. My only minor complaint would be with the displaying of some of the works. Even given the limitations regarding space I thought some works, which were hung well above eye level were difficult to appreciate. Similarly, a number of works were poorly lit. Caravaggio's 'David with the head of Goliath' was a prime example: the lighting meant that it was very difficult to view the painting without reflections from the varnishing being problematic.These are minor quibbles however. Galleria Borghese is a great gallery & well-worthy of being a 'must see' on any visit to Rome."

The audioguide goes for 1.5 hours and you're only allowed to be there for 2 hours. So if you're sharing an audioguide, listen to it together. Also, I overheard the personal guide taking a group around and they basically said the same thing as the audioguide. I guess the difference is that you can ask them questions if you want. The audioguide map was quite confusing though. The paintings/sculptures had been rearranged. We managed by just walking from room to room and just pushing the relevant choices in.Personally, I really enjoyed this because the crowd voulme was controlled and I actually had a chance to stop and admire the artwork, unlike many of the other attractions. The paintings were beautiful and the history of how the entered this collection was also fascinating.:)"

Entry is only by timed ticket, and is strictly limited to 2 hours. This was the palace of an extremely wealthy family who collected the very finest art. It is displayed in the rooms that were designed around the collection. The sculpture is especially fine. Walking into a room with Canova's \"Pauline Bonaparte as Venus\" is unforgettable. The next room has Bernini's \"David,\" which according to Rick Steves was a self-portrait of the artist as a vigorous, confident young man of 25. In the next room, Bernini's \"Apollo and Daphne\" is worth the price of admission all by itself. It depicts the moment Daphne transformed herself into a tree to escape the attentions of Apollo. The piece is so delicate and airy that it is hard to believe you are looking at a huge piece of marble.The paintings are also very fine. The entire palace is a work of art, with something beautiful on every single surface. The lighting is warm and bright, so the palace still feels like a home.We had the last 2-hour time slot of the day. As we left, caterers rushed onto the front loggia to set up a fancy private dinner . There were huge floral arrangements, small tables set with sparkling silver and china, and a spectacular buffet. We lingered a little on the stairs to watch the first guests arrive in formal wear. Alas, our invitations must have been lost in the mail. We walked back through the park, content with our glimpse of aristocratic life past and present."

However remember to book, as they limit places specifically to make it more enjoyable and manageable (the Vatican could learn a thing or two).

None were labeled in English. That would make a good 5th grade English project for an Italian elementary school. The major room was closed for repair, which is certainly excusable but much else is just bad presentation. Better spending the extra time at the Vatican Museum.

I was the only one to sign up for the tour, and therefore, the gallery does not do the tour (apparently, there must be at least 2 people for them to give a tour). However, instead of telling me this at 11am (when I could have entered the gallery on my own), the staff elected to dither around, and finally told me that the tour would not go at 11:20am. Then, they had to give me a refund, and give me the audio recording (which took another 5 minutes). Finally, they told me the wrong starting point on the audioguide, so that I had to come back down to the desk to ask for clarification (another 10 minutes). It was a nightmare, the staff was hostile and actively obstructionist, and as a result I did not get to complete the entire tour of the gallery. When I pointed this out, the staff blamed me. This soured me on the gallery for the unprofessional behavior. So... the art is amazing, and should not be missed. However, avoid the staff at all costs as they will hinder your enjoyment of this wonderful exhibit."

Canova's Venus reclines on cushions you would believe to be soft to the touch...I could go on and on - you must go to experience them for yourselves.

A few things to know before you go: you MUST have a reservation (ask your Hotel for help), you should allow a least an hour to get to the Galleries, it is nestled (hidden) in Rome's \"Central Park\" and while everything in Rome is \"just 5 minutes up on your right\" allow time to get to this Gallery, not to be confused with the 4 or 5 other Museos in the park. It is worth the trip, effort and their rules (yes you do have to check your bag, right down to your small hand held purse) in an open cubby hole \"storage\" system. Only 360 people are allowed in at a time, your ticket reservation grants you 2 hours and when time is up, TIME IS UP! Only 90 people on the top floor. Enter, head straight to the top and work your way down; you will be able to see it all thoroughly in the two hours.It is NOT free, it was 8,50 Euros Nov 5, 2011 - well worth it! This was a private home in the past (NY'ers think the Frick) and if you take the hop on hop off bus please note that the Villa Borghese (which is the park) stop is about a 10 minute stroll to the Park, add another 10 or 15 in the park to get to the galleries, without getting lost. I cannot stress enough that you need to allow time to find this place, I cannot stress enough that if you go to one museum only in Rome, it should be this one but honestly don't limit yourself like that :-) ENJOY!"

We paid & then found they allowed no bags at all in. I carry my iPad in my pac safe bag (small compact & secure - NOT backpack size). This was the ONLY site on my whole 3 week trip to Italy that required this. No other sight did - not Vatican/Sistine, St Peter's, San Marco's Basilica in Venice, The Last Supper in Milan. Seriously the \"cloak room\" check line was huge, I stood & watched the attendant pile bags on open shelves willy nilly as he handed out claim checks. No lockers that I saw. It looked neither organized nor secure. About that time, we over heard a woman come to the desk to report the theft of her belongings. They had spilled out of her purse when she tripped on the curb & fell on her face. Her purse along with her cell phone & wallet that had spilled out were stolen quickly as she gathered herself off the ground. At this, we decided to leave without checking my bag. Just wanted to make people aware, this is not a peaceful or secure place to visit. Glad I skipped it."

So if you are looking at this or other reviews, book now! Go to the website that is attached and click on ticket reservations. Be sure and check the times that they are open. If you are in Rome call the number on the website or have your hotel call to see if you can get in. Don't miss it. I would highly recommend that you take the guided tour. It costs more but you may be rewarded with the Curator and an unexpected lesson in art that you will never forget! I learned more about art in my visit to this museum (because of the guided tour) than I have anywhere. It was a treat for someone with limited knowledge but enjoys the beauty of art and the stories of the artists. The Guide for the tour was EXCELLENT for both the art buff and tourist! The history of the galleria and it's works were explained as well as artists, their styles and their differences! And of course, she had the pictures and sculptures right there to show us! I have since seen other works of art that she spoke about in Madrid at the Prado and to my amazement in Montserrat outside Barcelona. So, do yourself a favor and take the guided tour!!!!!! You won't regret spending the extra few Euros! Take your time and enjoy the Borghese Gardens and the astounding views. Stroll through the garden after your visit to the Galleria Borghese and breath in the fresh air! Contemplate on how lucky you have been to have seen and learned what you just have!! That's what I did! What a wonderful day indeed."

That said, unlike many of the museums that are over crowded (I studied art in Paris and the museums there were NOTHING like the crowdedness of Italy museums) this was a bit better (please note, it's still crowded, but the flow of the museum allows the guides to move around each other). You only get 2 hours in the museum, but to give you an idea of how easily the place sells out, it was booked through tuesday when we were there on a sunday. After the museum, we had a walking tour of the gardens ending at sunset at a great vista of St. Peter's. Well worth it and the fun stories that surrounded each amazing artwork."

This museum was once owned by the Borghese family and the art collection therein was begun and largely curated by a former Cardinal (if I recall, whose uncle was a Pope). This was easily one of my most favorite attractions in all of Rome. If you are an art buff, it's a must. There are works by a number of great masters, but it was obvious Bernini was a favorite of the Cardinal. Your ticket allots you a specific 2-hour window in which to enjoy the museum. The size of the museum is manageable and the two hours provides ample time to enjoy the collection. This is a wonderful value from a time and money perspective and I would highly recommend it to anyone.TIP: Buying tickets ahead of time online is nearly a must. If you have some time to kill before or after your visit, the Zoo is about a 5-10 minute walk away, also in the Villa Borghese."

The collection of Bernni's statutes etc.. are woth the price of admission. You are not allowed to bring any kind of bag (including purses) and or camreas.They strickly enforece those policies."

All the sculptures, paintings, fresco etc are top notch, and created by some of the most famous artists in the history. I am not an art connoisseur, but thoroughly enjoyed the museum.They allow only upto 300 people at a time in the museum so you need reservations in advance. Reserving 3-4 days in advance should be fine. However if you plan to visit on a weekend, you may want to reserve a bit earlier.Limiting number of people to 300 at a time means it is not at all crowded and you can enjoy the art at your own pace.To reserve, you can visit their website, or call them. If you want to avail Roma Pass at this museum, you have to call them.Most important tip: Definitely take the audio tour! It's excellent, very interesting and a bit interactive too. You won't regret it!While you are in that area, you may also want to roam around in the Villa Borghese!"

Although this seems strict, it provided for a wonderful viewing experience. If you've been to the Lourve to see Mona Lisa, you know what I mean. It is not one of the biggest museums nor one that has the most to see but with the 2 hour \"reservation\", it is the perfect amount of time. I suggest going for the audio guide (5 euros) since it does give you interesting information. Not a must see but more of a \"glad I went to see it\" kind of attraction."

The Galleria Borghese ingeniously admits only 360 lucky people every two hours, and this time limit is strictly enforced. While initially this may seem overly harsh, it's an idea that other museums (yes, this means you, Vatican Museum and Uffizi!) would do well to adopt. The result is an uncrowded, leisurely experience. In two hours, I had more than enough time to stroll through all the rooms at an unhurried pace and to revisit rooms with my favorite pieces. Because there are no crowds, your view of the paintings and statues are not blocked by others, and you have ample room to step back and see the paintings or statuary in perspective, as well as from different angles. There are backless couches so that you may lie flat on your back to view the magnificent painted ceilings, as several people were doing during my visit (ok, I confess, I did it too!). Even though I was initially unfamiliar with the artists who were on display there, I was bowled over by the collection and its presentation. Or perhaps charmed is a better word. While out of the way, the museum is a stately building in the Villa Borghese park, surrounded by gardens and more statuary. Despite its relatively isolated location, mandatory reservation requirements and time limits, it's a must see. The two hours that I spent in the Galleria Borghese were the best, coolest, most relaxing, and most enjoyable two hours I spent in Rome."

We booked prior to leaving for our holiday and could only get a ticket for 3pm on the day we had chosen, which meant that we had to cut short a visit to Ostia Antica to fit it in. Tickets were \u20ac12.50 each. We arrived early so had time for a drink prior to commencing our visit. Staff in the cafeteria were rude and surly, similarly those in the bag-check area. I understand that their jobs are probably boring but they didn't help to make the visit a positive experience. The internet voucher had to be exchanged for \"proper\" tickets and this could not be done at the door so some visitors were having to fight their way back through the queue to get to the ticket desk in the basement. Everyone for the 3pm visit is allowed entry at the same time so this can make the earlier rooms very busy with tour groups - if visiting independently I would make for a room further from the door and enjoy some solitude then work backwards. The rooms and the sculptures are breathtaking, particularly the Bernini sculptures, but we found that the collection of paintings was not so interesting and although I am a regular visitor to galleries we found that after an hour we had finished our tour and did not need the two hours allotted to us. I could not really see why it was necessary to make an appointment for individual visitors although can see that this made sense for groups as some of the rooms are relatively small. Overall, a not entirely positive experience due to the hassle of booking and the attitude of the staff."

I had to take two busses across the city to get to the Mueseo Borghese, but I can tell you it was well worth it.I was lucky and called the day before I wanted to go, my last day in Rome, and was able to get a ticket. When I arrived at the Museum, I noticed a sign in the ticket office that no tickets were available til four days later, so I was lucky. You should call ahead to reserve a ticket early. You can reserve for a specific entrance time, and then pay when you get there, so do show up a half hour early as they advise. Groups can go in at 9am, 11 am, 1 pm, 3 pm or 5 pm. You will also have to check any bags, parcels, etc. and leave your camera at home, no cameras are allowed.Each entry time allows two hours to tour the museum, and what I liked about it was that it is not vast, and you can take your time going through both floors well within the two hours allotted.If you have a hard time with the stairs between floors, ask, because I noticed there was an elevator, though I had seen a few people staggering up the beautiful staircase who probably would have been better off on the elevator. Bathrooms and cafe on the bottom floor are handy.OK, those are the functional things I think of. The museum collection itself is wonderful beyond words. First floor mostly statues, second floor mostly paintings. The Bernini sculptures were the most lovely things I saw in all of Rome, and the paintings were terrific too. I am so glad that I took the trouble to go tour this highlight of Rome. You will find some of the greatest art in the world in a serene and relaxing setting that makes the most of the collection."

The other big time consumer-my husband waited in line to rent the audio guide while I waited in line to check our pack (nothing at all is allowed to be carried into the museum). After 15 minutes and finally reaching the head of the line, there is a little sign that says you must present your entrance ticket in order to leave valuables and I was sent to the rear of the line. Had to find my husband first to get my ticket. THEN, once we were ready to enter the museum, there was no signage to direct us, no one around to ask. By the the time we did enter, there was only 1 1/2 of our alloted time remaining. It's very strange that such a famous and wonderful museum is so disorganized. Put a damper on the visit."

Its a small gallery, on the edge of a large park North of the Spanish Steps - with an astonishing interior design, sculpture, mosaic and fine art collection. Much of the quality is on par with the Vatican Museums - but much more manageable in scale.Access is by timed ticket - which needed booking two or three days in advance. The ticket gave a couple of hours access, which was about as much as my brain could process in a visit.Some of the rooms are small, so move past the first few rooms on entry, and the other visitors soon spread themselves out to allow a pleasurable viewing of the magnificent pieces - light levels are surprisingly high.Small cafe and bookshop in the basement - or benches in the public park nearby. Free storage for bags."

But my partner went to the ticket office and inquired about entry that day. The clerk asked \"how many?\" Two.

Galleria Borghese is small, but has one of the highest concentrations of high quality art, particularly sculptures, of any museum I have ever visited. The Bernini sculptures, especially Apollo and Daphne, is worth the trip to Rome even if you see nothing else. You have to make reservations, but this is to limit the number of people in the museum at any one time. Because of this, there was absolutely no problem moving around and getting to really enjoy the artwork without feeling crowded. We arrived early and enjoyed a nice morning walk through the surrounding park before entering the museum."

Take a close look at the face of Bernini\u2019s David and study the tension and determination. Then check out the finger impressions in Proserpina\u2019s legs as Pluto takes her to the underworld. Or, for an all time \u201chow did he do that?\u201d moment, study the statue of Apollo and Daphne as she is turning into a tree. The second level consists of a number of paintings by Rubens, Titan, Raphael and Caravaggio. The Caravaggio\u2019s are really great; look at \u201cDavid with the head of Goliath\u201d \u2013 Goliath is a self-portrait of the artist. Do you think he resembled Pavarotti?

It is smaller than many other museums in the capital, which makes it even more appealing in a way. You don't feel exhausted and overwhelmed by the time you go through it (as sometimes happens with larger museums like the Vatican Museum or the Louvre). It is really a fantastic place in the middle of one of the huge beautiful parks in Rome. Be sure to make reservations before you plan your trip.

In fact the museum website states that you must reserve your ticket online at www.ticketeria.ie although I think you might be able to buy it on the day but you may have a long wait as groups of certain numbers are allowed entereance at timed intervals. Booking online would guarentee entry for your preferred timeslot. Allow yourself plenty of time as the gallery is set in a fabulous park. On a Sunday expect to see a lot of the locals out enjoying their sunday too. That was a real treat. There was even a Carbinieri horse band playing in the park. You can hire four wheeled bikes that two can pedal with room for extra adults or kids too you could also hire those things that you stand on whith wheels. Don't know what they're called but it's fun to see people on them :)At the Gallery itself you have to check your bag in and camera's are strictly forbidden. The ticket sales and bag check are downstairs. There are doors either side of the main entrance stairs. It takes around 2-3 hours to go round. Allow longer if you want to explore the huge park though. Once in the front door if you turn left the first actual room you go in is the Caravaggio room. The paintings are awe inspiring. One of my favourites in this room isn't a Caravaggio it's The Judgement of Solomon by Jose de Ribera. Look out for it , it's so moving. The scupltures too are outstanding. Especially the Rape of Proserpina.Before you leave via the gift shop, be sure to grab a coffee and a pastry at the cofee shop. You'll need some refreshment by then :). I was grateful for it myself."

In Rome you are constantly walking everywhere for ever through massive collections like in the Vatican Museums. This is short (2 hrs tops) and sweet.

There are a host of Bernini masterpieces (Rape of Proserpine, Apollo and Daphne, David, Bust of Scipione Borghese), and a room given over largely to Caravaggios (including David With the Head of Goliath). I'd wanted to see these works for years and wasn't disappointed. And all in a beautiful Baroque decorated house in a fantastic park away from the bustle and noise of the city centre. It' not cheap (\u20ac11.50 per person) and you have to pre-book tickets as 300 people are admitted every two hours, but it's a brilliant way to pass a couple of hours if you love Renaissance or 17th Century art. Check out the Roman mosaic floors too - very dramatic and bloodthirsty."

You don't have to pre-book. I didn't book but arrived early and got tickets for the 11am slot - but for peace of mind, it is recommended to avoid disappontment. 2. Make sure you don't miss the exquisite Caravaggio, Raphael etc art which is located on the second floor. There is a stairway in one of the rooms to take you up there but it isn't well sign posted. If in doubt ask someone to point you in the right direction. 3. I would recommend getting an audioguide which really provides a little more historical/cultural context to the pieces. They are in numerous languages- To get one you have to leave one form of ID as a deposit, for example a driving license, credit card etc.4. You will be asked to leave your bags in a locker for which you will receive a key so when travelling to the Galleria it may be a good idea to take just what you need so you don't feel anxious leaving any valuables in a locker while you tour. It seemed totally safe and you get everything returned.5. Do try and book/go early if you can. You only have 2 hours and they are strict with this time slot so use the time well to enjoy the pieces! - Finally, when you first walk in look up at the ceiling, many people miss the beautiful fresco, make sure you don't!"

With the timed entry, you can't even take it back to the hotel. They also need your passport if you want to rent a headset - so if you only carry a copy, or don't like parting with your passport, you are out of luck. With general concerns of fraud & having read reports on various forums of credit card theft when renting equipment within the park, I questioned my visit. I am a seasoned traveler & generally a trusting person, but have rarely encountered such rigid requirements at a site. Needless to say, I had an extremely short visit and have no plans to go back to Gallery Borghese during my next trip to Rome in a few months. The staff wasn't all that nice either - and this was when I was still looking forward to my visit (before I learned of the bag check requirement). If you go, plan on doubling back to your hotel to get your stuff after your visit, or plan on checking it. When you go to pick up your online ticket, arrive early and go to the entrance at ground level (under the stairs).

Really nice gallery, however, at least in high season you are limited to only 2 hour visit and must have reservation for certain time in order to buy tickets. We didn't know that and had to wait 2 hours for the next entrance time (luckily the gardens and park have enough attractions to spend time (quadruple bikes, auto carts, little boats on the pond that you can rent) so, we were able to get in afterall. There is even a little zoo in the park, that we didn't go to, but you can easily spend a whole day in the Borghese park and museum."

Many other museums in Italy feature incredible art collections, but this museum stands out in the way it is presented. Located in a beautiful pallazzo surrounded by a huge park, the art is exceptionally well displayed and is not overwhelming. Very importantly, visits are limited to 2 hours and the number of visitors is also strictly limited, so that the overall experience, particularly during the busy summer months when other museums are packed and uncomfortable, was really wonderful.

What luck! You get a two-hour ticket with the entry date stamped on it, and most people trickle out of the place by the end of the two hours, but my husband and I stayed there the entire time, and had the opportunity to have the best museum experience of our European trip.The Borghese is not the biggest museum in Rome, but it packs a punch - no filler here, only some of the finest sculptures in the world set in beautiful themed rooms with ceiling and wall art. Bernini's Rape of Proserpina, Apollo and Daphne, and David were the highlights of the museum - they are breathtaking, and I feel fortunate to have seen them. I have to say that after seeing the British National Galley, the Louvre, the Uffizi, the Accademia, the Vatican Museum, and others, the Borghese Gallery really is my favorite."

The audio tour provided wonderful insight into the creation of these pieces. Do make your reservations early. Another couple that we spoke with were unable to visit the gallery, as they had not made a reservation before arriving in Rome and no times remained during the rest of their stay. Also, be sure to arrive early enough to pick up your tickets and check your bags (we actually picked up our tickets the day before which saved us time the morning of our visit). If you have time, stroll the beautiful park before or after your visit to the gallery."

A bus takes you directly to and from Villa Borghese, the setting of the museum, from the Roma Termini train station. Don't be turned off by the requirement of advance reservations. Since we were getting the Roma Pass for our 3-day visit, I had to call the ticket office (closed on the weekends) instead of making reservations online. We received a confirmation number to submit upon entry and it was very easy. Galleria Borghese has many restrictions \u2013 reservations, check backpacks, no cameras, two-hour time slot \u2013 but all of this adds up to a relaxing, uncrowded museum experience. It was so much nicer than the hot, stuffy, extremely crowded and claustrophobic experience at the Vatican Museum. The smaller scale of the building (basically a mansion) makes it easy on the kids, too. The museum houses some amazing artwork but the sculptures are the real draw. Bernini's \"David\" is much more interesting than Michelangelo's, no offense. The teardrop on the girl's face in the sculpture \"Pluto and Proserpina\" is absolutely surreal. After enjoying the art, go out to the park and explore beautiful Villa Borghese. Highly, highly recommended!"

The gallery features Bernini at his best, you can see the sculptures up close, take in every detail, my favorite sculpture is \"Apollo and Daphne\", exquisite. Bernini's \"David\" is amazingly expressive and \"Rape of Proserpine\" is the most powerful of them all... it is mind-blowing to see what Bernini could do with marble. Take your time, the gallery will not disappoint. Once you are done, be sure to roam about the Borghese Gardens. The walk is calming before heading back into the awesome insanity that is Rome."

Frustrating to many a traveller are the critics, who when you get home tell you about the wonderful places you did not visit, the one they never mention is the Galleria Borghese. Rome is a complex city and I doubt that any tourist could visit everything of interest in a short period. However there were a couple of places that are a must to visit. One of these is the Galleria Borghese. It is at one end of the Borghese Gardens which are immediately behind the Church at the top of the Spanish Steps (Piazza Spagna) A short walk through the gardens will bring you to the Borghese. Check that it is open before you go and note that there are two entrance times per day. This gallery holds a candle to other great galleries such as the Louvre, The Prado and the Vatican Museum. Prominent among the various works of art, sculptures and frescoes is a remarkable and large collection of the work of Bernini. It is said that Rome belongs to Bernini. The Borghese collection bears tis out."

Bernini and Canova dominate. I suggest that you spend a bit of time with Bernini's \"David\" and witness the resolve on his face. Apollo and Daphne and Th eRape of Proserpine are testiments to Bernini's virtuosity. Canova's rendering of Pauline Bonapart as Venus is quite striking as well.There are some worthy painting here as well by Caravaggio, Raphael and Titian.

Who knew such gorgeous and life-like carvings could be created!? I now thoroughly understand what people mean when they say a piece of artwork strikes them to their core. I highly recommend this museum to any art-lover out there. However, if you really just hate artwork, then this place is not for you. Reminder: you need to place an order for your tickets online before arriving. They only let a limited number of people in at once and it's only for a certain amount of time as the museum is quite small and they want everyone to easily observe the work. You are also not allowed to brings bags into the museum itself, but they have storage lockers available where you pick up the tickets. It's very safe. The museum is basically situated inside of a mansion inside of the park. If you take the metro to, I believe, the Spagna stop, one of the exits takes you toward the park. It might not seem like the right place as you start walking through, but trust me, it is! People are very helpful, especially since they know it's hard to find, so don't hesitate to ask. There's vendors, etc. throughout the park and signs as you get farther in, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem."

I've been to every art museum in Paris, Amsterdam, London, Florence, Rome (including Vatican) and it was my favorite museum. I am an oil-painter and an art enthusiast...my husband is not.....we both LOVED this place. Bernini's sculptures were amazing and the background narration given by the audio-guide was fascinating. Not TMI like so many are. (vatican, Pompeii, etc....I usually shut them off the first 10 min.)  Afterwards, we rented bikes and enjoyed the gardens (really more of a park...not a lot of flowers). Lots of good food vendors and cafes to grab a picnic or sit at a table and enjoy getting away from the crowds. We went on a Fri. morning then spent the rest of the day relaxing before our Vatican entry at 7:00 pm (highly recommend - no crowds)"

Your ticket is for a timed admission and that does cause a bit of a crowd to form once you get inside. This tends to thin as you get further into the building and you can double back at the end and have some rooms to yourself. Would recommend getting the audio guide to the get the most out of your visit.I've read some reviews or Forum comments that say you don't need to book tickets in advance - well, a couple walked in ahead of us and were told the next available tickets were 7 days from then. This was only the third week of May.While waiting outside we even got to see Rick Steves filming a piece at the Gallery - it took about 10 takes to get him walking up a set of stairs and speaking for maybe 15 seconds. On that basis I would guess a 30 minute program on Rome must take about 6 months to film!"

While we were there the lights went out for almost 15-20 minutes. We ended up leaving shortly afterward. Unless you are truly passionate for art, I would not recommend this museum. I Just a note that you will need to check-in all your bags, purses, cameras.

Bernini also sculpted The Rape of Proserpine, Aeneas and Anchises, and David with the Sling. There was also the Venus Victrix, a life-size statue of Pauline Borghese created by Canova. She was the sister of Napoleon and the wife of Prince Camilo Borghese. In the Great Hall, there were 12 busts of the Emperors, created by Giovanni Battista Della Porta. Our visit to this museum was very satisfying."

By restricting number of visitors, we didn't have to deal with the crowds we ran into such as Uffizi (avoid it at all cost) and the Vatican. Another big plus of Borghese is its limited collection and small but beautiful facility. They don't have a large collection but MOST Of them are true master pieces (most than other large museums). You don't need to walk miles to see all of them. Their audio guide is very organized and has wonderful content. It not only explains the significance of the art but also includes very interesting anecdotal related stories. Out of our entire trip to Italy (Rome, Florence, Venice), this is our favorite museum.

I fell in love with the incredible Bernini sculptures and my husband loved the paintings. It was worth every penny and I'm glad we paid extra for the audio guides, they were very helpful.Things to keep in mind: You can only use the Roma Pass if you book by phone. Booking online is easy - just make sure you remember to print out your confirmation and bring it with you so you can get your tickets. I highly recommend following Rick Steves' Rome guidebook (which has a good self-guided tour in it) and start with the upper floor (paintings) first as most people start with the sculptures on the lower floor. By following this advice (thanks Steve - you are awesome!), we had an opportunity to be alone in rooms with some of the world's most gorgeous artwork - what a thrill! If you decide to book a tour with a tour company, make sure they keep their numbers small (i.e. no more than 15 people) as some of the rooms aren't very large and being part of a large group would take away from the experience. You must check ALL of your baggage (cameras, phones, purses, etc) but you can't check your jacket. So, stuff your jacket in your bag if you don't want to carry it around. We found the park surrounding the museum to be perfect for a picnic and enjoyed walking through the park afterwards towards the Piazza del Popolo (great views from above). If you're planning a picnic, buy your sandwiches before you get there, the sandwiches sold from the trucks at the park are overpriced and gross. Or, arrive early or stay late and eat at the cafe on site."

I decided to visit this museum based on the AA guide recommending it as one of the best museums in Rome. Be warned, this is very popular and, in order to ensure you get to see it, you need to book your tickets in advance. This can be down in a couple of ways, using their online booking service which incurs a 1\u20ac fee on top, or you can reserve a ticket by telephone if you want to use the Roma Pass. However, they sell out quickly...I, however, did not pre book and turned up early on a Wednesday morning, I waited outside from about 8 a.m. to ask about returns or any spares. The sign outside said they were already sold out until the following Tuesday. When the doors opened for the pre booking collection at half past I asked and they were unable to tell me until just after 9 a.m., once they knew the exact numbers for that session. From what I know, they only allow 300 in the museum in each 2 hour session. I was lucky enough to have a return and was able to enter at 9.10. However, I would recommend that you do not get your hopes up, and pre book.The museum is fantastic with some of the best sculptures I have ever seen by Bernini. They are trult breathtaking and in wonderful condition. The two best, in my opinion, are David and Apollo & Daphne. This is an absolute must for any art lover, and even for those who are not into art as the museum has a wonderful, but relatively small, collection, if you compare it to the Louvre etc.You only have a limited time in the museum but the two hours allocated was adequate."

We made a reservation by calling from the US so we could use our Roma Pass and not pay ahead of time. This went smoothly. We walked from our hotel near the Spanish Steps and it's a lovely, albeit longer walk than anticipated! The walk within the park reminded me a bit of Central Park in New York City.Rick Steve tour book recommended that we start on the second floor where there would be less of a crowd, which we did. We were able to admire every piece with a slow walk and some stoppage time with extra time to visit some of the more beautiful marble sculptures 2 or 3 times before we were kicked out. Don't rush, 2 hours doesn't seem like enough time, but it worked well for us. The marble statues were the highlights of the visit there - read up on what you are going to see, the statues will be even more inspiring. No pictures allowed, so leave time to soak up what you can. We didn't get a chance to really explore the grounds due to cold rain (we were there in November), but if you have the time, I would recommend it - a great way to step away from the crowds."

I am not an avid art fan however was in awe of these beautiful sculptures and even more so knowing that he completed some at age 15. Our Hotel Concierge booked on our behalf with less than 24 hours notice, so this may be the easiest way to arrange a viewing. Note that the 9am tour is the least busiest (and most relaxing).Because of the Galleria's strict booking procedures you are able to see the artworks without jostling through the crowd (they limit the number of visitors daily, allocating 2 hour timeslots to each group) and without feeling pressured to move onto the next item. It is a truly amazing collection of art - Caravaggio, Bernini, Raphael, ancient Roman mosaics from the 1st century AD, ancient Greek sculptures, ceilings painted by Renaissance Masters, Egyptian art etc. I would highly recommend paying the extra 6 euro to join a Guided Tour with a qualified Art Curator (4 euro for audio guide). The information we received about various pieces in each room really enhanced our visit. Otherwise would have been wondering about looking at the pieces without realising their significance in the Borghese collection. And the stories of how some pieces were \"acquired\" were truly fascinating. The curator who conducted our Tour had a particular love for Bernini and her enthusiasm rubbed off onto all of us. She even told us the where the best position to stand to see various aspects of the sculptures and artworks. I would also recommend purchasing a Roma Pass before making your booking to receive either free entry or a discounted entry. We found the Roma Pass to be incredible value as it also included all transportation in Rome (25euro).The Galleria is situated in a stunning house which used to be the Borghese Family's country estate; so the grounds and gardens are amazing too. Make a day of it by attending the 9am viewing, then hiring a bike to ride around the lakes and sculptures of Villa Borghese. There is plenty to see and kiosks for food/refreshments. It is actually a relaxing day when considering how frantic Rome is.You can catch a bus to the Galleria, or catch the Metro to Spagna. Follow the escalators to the top and take the exit to Via Veneto. It is a bit of a walk (about 10 mins) but not difficult to find the Galleria. Once inside Villa Borghese, there are signposts to the Galleria.Enjoy!"

One of my favorite things to do in foreign cities is to see their art, and so when I read about the Galleria Borghese collection, I decided we had to go, even though I usually avoid attractions that require any extra effort - and you are required to book ahead to visit the Borghese, as they only allow about 350 people in at a time, and each group is in for two hours. The building is in a lovely spot, and the collection is breath-taking - especially the rooms in which it is housed, but don't miss the Bernini sculptures, which look like they were once real and might come to life at any moment, or the paintings, which include everything from Rubens to Caravaggio. Note that photography is not permitted.I had occasion to need help from the staff, as my mother was feeling very unwell but didn't want to miss the gallery, so I had to arrange for her to have a wheel chair. The ticket desk staff was fairly rude to me, but the two women who were working the information desk were exceptionally helpful, ran around trying to figure out how to make it work, let my mother sit in one of their comfy chairs when she came in, and made sure that everything was set up so that we could enjoy our experience - they even let us in almost ten minutes early! We did end up having a hitch - due to the small size of the elevator, it was necessary for us to change wheel chairs on each floor, and the elevator could only be accessed by the staff - in that on the first floor, we could find no one who could help us get back down to the ground floor, so we managed the stairs. (the only staff member I found told me it was \"impossible\" even when I pointed at my mother in the wheel chair - but there was a definite language barrier making it harder).We also went to the cafe, which was tasty, and I've been happily reading the very thorough \"The Borghese Gallery\" book, and wishing all small museums had books that recorded their collections with such care."

The long list of rules (no bags, no cameras etc) stiulate that you must arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled visit time. (You are given an entrance time and an exit time). The time slots limit the number of visitors.We found the staff unfriendly and unsmiling. Three staff sitting at the \"information desk\" were more intent on having a discussion with one another than aiding visitors. We witnessed two staff actually having an argument in front of museum visitors. The gallery guide was difficult to read - the English version was written entirely in italics with no paragraphing or eye friendly typesetting. Beware school parties and guided parties who crowd the rooms despite the limit on the volume of visitors. It is best to try and circulate in the opposite direction to these large groups and bypass them, returning to the room where they were after they have moved on. Despite everything the art is amazing. Several important pieces were on loan, but the opportunity to \"get close and personal\" with some great Bernini sculptures and some Carravagio paintings was worth the considerable hassle and unpleasantness."

I was especially knocked out by Bernini's Apollo and Daphne. Does marble have motion? Is it pliable and soft to the touch? You will believe it when you see this masterwork. We visited on a sunny day, and the light shining on the statue passed right through the leaves above Daphne, glimmering with a translucent glow. Stunning.We visited 5 museums during our visit, including the Vatican.

Set in the beautiful former palace grounds of the uber-swanky Borghese Clan and easily reached via Rome's extensive bus system, the Galleria Borghese holds masterworks by many of Europe's best artists from the baroque period. Most notably Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Michelangelo Merisi/Caravaggio, who happned to compete at the highest levels of art making for fame and fortune in their time. Bernini seemingly conquering all challenges in sculpture and architecture up to a point... and Caravaggio unquestionably mastering painting, if not his personal life... but I digress!Make time for this visit! I would not bother with any less than 2.5 hours here (spent that on the first floor alone, where the major sculptures are) 4 hours would be perfect. Three main sculptures by Bernini housed here: his revolutionary David-ready to launch his stone at Goliath, Pluto and Proserpina-in all its muscle and flesh glory, and as a counterpoint Apollo & Daphne-exquisite sensuality, movement and metamorphosis! (You may want to pre-brief any 14-18 yr olds before the visit to supress nervous giggles ;) Here too you will see Caravaggio's curious Madonna of the Palafrenieri-with young Jesus samping out the serpent, and the somewhat less than celabratory David with the Head of Goliath-supposedly painted his own head as Goliath, hmmm... My only complaint.. NO Photographs!?! further info at http://www.galleriaborghese.itEnjoy!"

The villa was primarily used by Cardinal Scipione Borghese to house his art collection.

Summary: very rude staff with poor attitude. very unsafe bag check area, zero security. no mention of no bag and camera before you buy your ticket. no refund or exchange after you are not agreed to leave your bag behind.I am sure most people agree there are some great scultures and paintings in the Gallery and it is a must see. No doubt about it but I got a really bad experience with their staff. We got the ticket, the lady was just doing a routine job, no eye contact, no smile, just print us the ticket, that's fine. We were told to head to the bag check counter because no bag is allowed inside. We headed there and I felt unsafe to leave my bag with my $3000 camera and lens with them because it looks like they are just putting all the bags behind a room or something behind the counter and no locks, they just give you a number like coat check. I expressed my concern in a normal tone and the staff just said it's safe, it's safe. I asked who is going to be responsible for any lost or damage, they said it's them (pointing at himself). I asked who is going to insure them (the staff), they said the whole gallery. Then they started to raise the voice and this is exactly the guy said twice \"it's safe, it's safe. I don't care if you want to leave your bag here or not, I don't care.\" Then he walked away from the counter towards the cafe or something while yelling and not looking at me either. So now the counter which they claim is safe has no staff standing. I can easily walk in there and take whatever I want and leave, there is absolutely zero security and this is exactly I was worried. I ended up letting my friends going to the gallery first and waited them to come back and watch for my bag when they are done so I can go up an quickly see what's interesting.While waiting, I realized the ticket says it's only valid for 2 hours. So kindly asked the ticket staff if I could have a time slot change. Without looking at me at all and she said \"I cannot change it, there is no change or refund on your ticket\" and then point at a piece of paper. \"You should leave your bag there and go\". Again no eye contact, no smile but at least she was not yelling. I said that is fine.I don't want to waste my time to tell them there is no mention of no bag or camera before I commit to buy the ticket as I notice it seems no one can do anything. There is only one simple rule for them in their mind, no bag in the gallery. If I have known this ahead of time, I would not buy my ticket.I went to several other galleries, and churches and in general, the other staff or security were fine and sometimes nice."

From issues to paying for the tickets, to a bag that we checked (all bags must be checked, which I don't have a problem with as it makes alot of sense) that we weren't given a claim ticket for as they just weren't handing them out and then were told it was impossible to not have a claim ticket for, to the guy taking tickets being very rude when asking us to please wait outside instead of inside the vestibule with the shade for our time (which wasn't obvious as the door was wide open), the attitude of those that work at this gallery was unmatched by any of the 15+ museums and galleries that we've been to in Italy in the past 2 weeks.Definitely would not go back and wish we hadn't been in the first place. Honestly, there are plenty of other places to see art (especially if your trip includes Florence or Venice, or possibly other cities in Italy which we didn't make it to on this trip) that you don't need to put up with the attitude of this gallery."

Nothing jumped out at me with a 'wow' factor, which I thought would have happened despite not knowing the details.Downgraded from a neutral score because of the ritual to get in. Booked in advance, then you have to collect your tickets on the day more than 30 minutes before your 2 hour time slot, which means 2 visits here in one day (better ways to spend limited holiday time than collecting tickets).On the 2 hour timeslots: 3 till 5 means you can arrive after 3pm (I thought you had to be there for 3), people are let inside in 30 minute intervals, and all out by 5pm. Once inside, I needed about 45 minutes to see everything. 360 people are admitted in each 2 hours slot, it would comfortably hold more than that so the cynic in me thinks they are creating a shortage to make it more well-known."

When I was in the Galleria, I appreciated the fact that the museum limits how many people can enter and how long each person can stay. It was so much better than most of the other places we went, because we didn't have to deal with huge, noisy crowds.Museum: The entire building seems to be decorated. It is as though each surface is covered in detailed ornamentation. I had seen many photos before visiting, but I could not fully fathom just how ornately decorated each wall, ceiling and floor truly is. You only visit two floors. There are a few key artworks on the second floor, but not that many. I suggest quickly passing through the second floor and saving most of your time for the Bernini sculptures, celing frescos, and Caravaggio paintings. Art: Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! I just cannot stress this enough. The Bernini's are incredible and so much more magnificent in person. The Caravaggio paintings are more colorful in person. The ceiling frescos-well, let's just say that it is easy to understand why a couple of them are so important in the grand scheme of the art world. One of them directly quotes Michelangelo's color usage in a really obvious way. Just amazing.Food/Drink/A Place to Sit: There is a moderately priced cafe. However, expect to pay extra and to wait a long time if you want a seat. You can stand and drink at the bar, like most places in Europe, but know that there really is no where to sit in the entire museum, except for the cafe and a bench or two in the hallway.Gift Shop: Limited selection of items, many of which are lame or just not entirely relevant to the collection you just saw.Tip: There is a Metro station closer to the Galleria Borghese, just outside the grounds, across the street. It is within maybe three or four blocks or 3/4 of a mile from the Galleria."

The statues he created for Card. Borghese are hard to put in words---amazing to say the least. During low season it is easier to get in without reservations, but in the summer reservations are a must. There are 3 2-hour slots to get in, and you are only allowed 2 hours to see the collections.In my opinion, this is th #2 museum that you should see in the city, after the Vatican Museums.

It was 2 stores filled with fabulous sculpture and paintings. This is where Pluto & Prosperina, Apollo & Daphne and the Venus statue (with Paolina Borghese) are. Bernini's works are visually stunning and can see the emotions and muscles of the pieces. They also have somewhat of a secret and very clean bathroom in between the first and second floors. We stroll through both floors, sit on the wide salon couches in the upstairs rooms and soak in all the paintings around us. We also head down to the gift shop, buy some postcards as photos are not allowed. The employees are fine but not friendly. We only used up an hour and a half of our 2 hour allotment. After, we stroll through the gardens and walk through Villa Borghese (the bigger park outside of the Galleria) to Via Veneto.

I saw people being turned away while I was waiting in line to collect tickets. And check out the map of Villa Borghese before going. The distance is much much more than it seems.

For periods during the next eight years they are featuring specific artists. This year (through early February 2008) it is the sculptor Canova with the centerpiece being his daring portrait of Paolina Borghese. The admission fee is 12.50Euros including the mandatory fee for the Canova exhibit.We went this week and signed up for a guided tour (5Euro) which lasts about one hour and twenty minutes and offers a different perspective than the regular audio guides (also 5Euro). I plan on going back and using the audio guides to take advantage of both perspectives.Caveats: (1) The gallery is not handicapped or even mildly disabled friendly. Apart from the steps down into the basement for the tickets, in order to get to the second floor of the gallery one has to climb many stairs (I didn't count them but I would guess there are around 50 or 70 steps). Apparently the lift is not strictly a visitor lift, not being insured for such use, and is currently broken.(2) There is a cafe in the basement which serves pretty decent coffee but think before sitting down. A cafe latte' is 1.80Euro standing at the bar and 3.50Euro at a table.(3) All bags (including purses), cameras, strollers, etc must be checked and its pretty chaotic for both checking and retrieving one's bags, expect a 15 to 20 minute wait immediately after a 2 hour viewing block. One person complained about the lack of signs from Spagna. If you're in that neighborhood consider taking the 116 Electric Bus to Porta Pinciana and then walking. Alternatively, go into the Spagna Metro station (don't go down to the trains) and follow the signs for Via Veneto. There is an underground walkway/gallery/shops that takes one to the top of Via Veneto exiting next to Harry's Bar at Porta Pinciana, turn left on Via Veneto, go through the Porta in the city wall, cross Coros d'Italia (busy Road) and its a 10 minute walk along the traffic free avenue to the Galleria. If one is coming from Termini, take the number 910 bus, it drops you off right at the park entrance by the Galleria. Ask the driver for the stop (they are usually accommodating but don't expect a conversation)."

We had a 2 hour slot but it was more than adequate and we got bored after a while as it all began to look the same. I prefer the sculptures to the painting upstairs but it's a personal preference. The only downside was not being able to take photographs. I made the mistake of not reading up about the sculptures before I went and since I have got back i've done some reading and it far more interesting once know what you are looking at. It may seem like common sense but I would advise checking out their website properly before you go. [-]"

            "review": "A must-see for the art lover. The Borghese Museum is small but definitely world-class and a must-see attraction when you're in Rome. The only downside is that you have to make reservations and you only have a 2 hour timeslot. Photographs are not allowed which is also a disappointment since the scultrures are truly outstanding. There is a small giftshop in the comparatively modern basement and the surrounding park is a nice place to stroll and relax."

            "review": "Awesome Sculpture Collection. We absolutely loved our visit to Borghese Gallery. Yes, they restrict you to 2 hours. But for savvy travelers who do their research and make reservations well in advance (at least one month) this is not a problem. We simply showed up at our time, collected our tickets, dropped our bags at the mandatory bag check and had 2 full hours to soak up the incredible Bernini detail.The sculptures are amazing. My personal favorites: \"Apollo and Daphne\" and \"The Rape of Persephone\". They are just exquisite. I would definitely rate Borghese Gallery as a \"Do NOT Miss!!\" for Rome.I do agree with the previous reviewer that Rome in general can be hard to navigate because signage is terrible! The best advice I have: arm yourself with a good map and just ask locals where sites are. They're used to tourists and will usually help (even if it is grudgingly.)"

            "review": "Not visitor friendly. I was very excited to visit this attraction, as I had heard lots of good things about it. Sadly on the day, my visit was spoiled by the unfriendly vistor restrictions. Let me explain: You are only allowed to visit in two hour time slots 9 - 11; 11 - 1; 1 - 3 etc. We happened to arrive just before noon, unaware of the time factor. When we purchased tickets we were given the option to return at 1pm, or enter immediately but only get one hour in there. We were advised that a 30 minute video guide (on an Ipod) was available, and that would lead us to all the highlights. It's a small buliding anyway, so we decided to go ahead and do this. Inside there are some stunning rooms that contain some equally stunning art. The Bernini sculptures are gorgeous, and the video guide did a great job of enlightening us on them. I was keeping one eye on my watch as I knew we only had until 1pm, or so I thought! At 12:50, an announcement was made that the session was over, and to please leave. I took that to be a nudge that you had only ten minutes left, but it was not a nudge - it was an order! A very gruff man came over and basically told us that our time was up, and motioned us to leave. I said it was only 12:50, but he didn't care, and said we had to exit. I was very very annoyed at this. Not only do they have these ridiculous restrictions, but then you are cut short aswell! That extra ten minutes was probably all we needed to see the final couple of rooms, but we were denied the chance. The irony is that it's a small gallery, and two hours would be more than enough for all but the most hardened art fan. The two hour timeslots are simply not necesessary. They should allow people to come and go at will, as 99% of other galleries and museums worldwide do!!!! I had the impression that they view the visitors as an annoyance. There was no welcoming atnmosphere in this place, which is a shame, as the art was gorgeous. One other thing to mention that spolied it too was the walk from the station. When you exit Spagna station there are one or two signs to direct you, but not enough to stop you getting lost. Rome as a whole could do with a better attitude to tourists. I didn't find the cities sites all that easy to navigate, which was a shame."

            "review": "Did not live up to expectations!. Having read all the reviews on this particular attraction, my expectations were very high, and made this prime spot on my list of things to do in Rome. After dodging the beggars in the park, then enduring the requirement to pre-book and wait for a time slot, plus queuing to deposit all the forbidden items (compulsory to deposit every kind of bag, purse, camera, video camera, umbrella etc), finally gained entrance to the museum. I like art and sculpture as much as anybody, but I must confess I did not get the wow factor that all the other reveiwers felt, and wonder if I missed something on the way round. Yes there were some very good sculptures by Bernini and grand master paintings; the ceilings were very ornate with decoration more vignette than verrio. There were very good room information cards in many languages in all the rooms, and an audio tour available too. But I found the rooms and the exhibits to be too constructed and repetitve after a while, and this is perhaps where my enthusiasm wandered, and was not returned by visiting the upstairs gallery. This was again (although I hate to say it) was a bit too \"studio\" and \"from the school of..\" for my liking. I must admit (again in contradiction of the earlier reviewers), I found the Vatican museum art and sculptures a better option. But as anything in life, you have to go and see for yourself to make your mind up, give an opinion, so do not let my review deter you to visit - either you will be pleasantly surprised and disagree with me, or nod sagely and say - I see what he meant. As Lord Bryon said - \"A drop of ink may make a million think.\""

            "review": "A Gem. This was the highlight of my trip to Rome. Our hotel was just across the road from the Borghese Gardens but I was aware of the Gallery and had prebooked our space prior to arriving.As with the previous reviewer I would HIGHLY recommend the guided tour rather than the audio tour - it literally cost's Euro 5 for an hour and half tour. Our guide was a lovely, lovely lady and SO knowledgable but in a very friendly and informal manner but she really knew her stuff. She went into the history of the Borghese family and the beautiful building as well as the actual works of art and sculpture. Without doubt the Bernini sculptures were the highlight of the tour - our guide explained the thought and process behind each piece and brought us all around each piece and let us touch them and really brought them to life for us. But there are amazing Titian and Carravaggio paintings also. We had been to the Vatican the previous day and had also gotten a guided tour, but the Vatican museum and Sistine Palace are so big and there is SO much art there its rather overwhelming. This is like visiting someone's house with great art and would recommend it as a must-see / do on anyone's trip to Rome and not just for art - buff's so to speak."

MUCH smaller then the Vatican Museum, the viewing much more personal, the artwork much more accessible. The crowd here was pleasant compared to the madhouse that is the Vatican Museum. And Bernini's work, just unbelievable to see.We almost skipped the Borghese Gallery but I'm glad we visited. The entire Borghese Village is an excellent change of pace from the rest of Rome. Like stepping into a garden after being cooped up in Times Square. Very nice, very relaxing, perfect for the last day of your vacation in Rome."

Plus, book for the first flight, at 9 am. (Have to show at 8.30 for tickets.) Advantage was that was the least crowded time, a real plus for Rome, which was distressingly crowded with tourists.Take the guided, rather than the audio tour, which is the same price. We had a delightful older docent who taught us a lot.After your two-hour session (they do chase you out), stroll across the Villa Borghese to the Etruscan Museum. That was an unexpected treat for us. Highlight was a stunning jewelry collection, plus the \"Sposa\" sarcophagus. (Have to look for the latter--it's a bit hidden because of renovations)."

The exhibition of Raphael was there with more than 50 of the masters works on display---the was a Bernini staue at every turn. Caravagio's line the walls like studio prints. I have toured the greatest art houses in europe and never have I been so overwhelmed by a collection. The depth and variety of the gallery is without equal. I rank this as one of the best I've ever seen, second only to the Vatican and the Louvre. GO!! Enjoy!! My only disappointment was the short time allowed for the visit. I could have spent the day easiy."

Don't get me wrong I am a big fan of Bernini's work as well, but I didn't find this museum all that great or amazing. I did however enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle of the Colosseum and Roman Forum. I found the paint gallery on the 2nd floor to be very quaint and interesting, but the sculpture section on the 1st floor is waaaaay overated. It didn't wow me like the capitoline museum did. Base on the previous reviews (not meaning to disrepect their opinions) I was a little disappointed. My only input is if you can't make it to this museum make sure you make it to the capitoline museam which to me is much better and closer to all of the other main attractions. On a positive note, I think I was expecting a little too much from the Borghese!"

The artwork was amazing, but we appreciated it so much more because we opted for the human tourguide (I've heard its much better than the audioguide.) Our guide did an incredible job of helping us to understand what we were looking at, why it was important in history, told us little rarely known secrets about the art, and gave us a much better appreciation for it all, which made it all much more interesting. We fell in love with Bernini's marble statues, and recognized them afterwards all over Rome. My only regret is we couldn't take pictures inside.

They say you have to make reservations, which I did, but when we got there we did not need them and people were just walking right in. Once you buy tickets, there is an area where you can rent an audio-guide or a regular tour guide. I would opt for the tour-guide. The audio was informative, but very very dry. And if you plan on walking there from the hotel, it's a very enjoyable workout, but it will take about an hour from the Spanish Steps to get there being the park it's in is huge."

It is hard to believe the textures and emotions that Bernine got from marble. I had a hard time stopping myself from wanting to touch them.We made our reservations on the internet - walked to the ticket office and were smilingly given out tickets which are issued for two hour slots to control the crowds. I would strongly advise taking the 9:00 A.M. slot for best viewing of the amazing frescos as well as the sculptures. Bon Voyage."
