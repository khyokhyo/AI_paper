The exhibits were very well laid out and very informative. We were only in Capetown for 4 days and this was a very important stop for us. when we are traveling, we enjoy learning about our surroundings as well as experiencing them. The Jewish Museum and the Old Synagogue and Holocaust Museum exceeded our desire for both. Just a reminder, Shabbat, the day of rest, is Saturday and hence tours are not available on that day."

The entire venue is of a world class standard and very professional. The Synagogue is a magnificent building in immaculate condition.  The main museum hosts exhibitions not exclusively relating to items of Jewish interest but also a wide range of other exhibitions. The main museum enters through was was the original synagogue, now decommissioned. The staff I encountered at the venue were warm, friendly, helpful and eager to answer questions.

I was very interested to see how theses religious articles have for the most part stayed true to form, over all these years. A magnificent replica of the Torah Arc was built there as well, which is quite beautiful.We made our way to the next building, which housed many interesting pictures and exhibits.I was especially moved by the Helen Suzman exhibit. This is a women who fought singlehandedly against apartheid for most of her life.Her story is absolutely remarkable and I watched the video of her life for more than half an hour, mesmerizing as it was.This was followed by a interesting collection of Japanese artifacts from a collection of one of the SA Community's prominent members.Once we finished this, we had a delicious lunch on the grounds and visited the gift store.All in all, it was a wonderful two hour visit and a worthwhile stop for anyone visiting Capetown."

You can also visit the Holocaust museum dedicated to the millions of Jews killed in WW2 and the Great Gardens Sunagogue. All within the same campus.

It tells the story of the Jewish community in this beautiful country, and of their triumphs and tragedies. It is very vivid and lively in its story-telling, and totally informed my visit to this city and country. There is a special exhibit about the Jewish contributions to the development of the ostrich feather industry along the Garden Route, and the uplifting and detailed hisstory I learned here, informed my visit there. If you go to the locations where the ostrich farms are, there is nobody to tell you, and no place where you can learn about the Jewish pioneers and their contributions to this industry. Similarly, there is an amazing exhibit about the Jewish community's fight and sacrifice alongside the black community to end the despised imposed apartheid laws. This museum wouldn't have been complete without an exhibit detailing the Holocaust, and it is a very moving and informative lesson about what evil humanity is capable of,the attempts at resistance, the political games played with immigration quotas that cost millions of lives, and so many other aspects of this attempt to obliterate the Jews of the world. These are lessons that must be preserved and applied in our own day, around the world. There is a lovely courtyard, gift shop and restaurant here, and it is right in the heart of a beautiful section of downtown Cape Town."

On the same grounds is South Africa's Holocaust Museum which, unfortunately, we got to just as load-sharing was kicking in and power was about to be turned off - so our visit was all-too-brief. But from we could see of it, it is an extremely well-done, state-of-the-art museum which covers its subject comprehensively and eloquently.

It is not just a museum, but remains a vibrant center of Jewish activities in Capetown. It has a small cafe with very reasonable prices (and includes Kosher food). The cafe allowed us to spend even more time exploring the museum. While my wife & I explore museums very differently (she does it in half the time that it takes me), we were both totally engrossed by the exhibits here. Walking around is not difficult for the mobility impaired. Expect to spend at least two hours.You need a photo ID to enter, but your passport is adequate.Our guide, the hotel we stayed at, and the museum do NOT recommend either walking to the museum or away from it; staff will call a taxi for you.

Find yourself an hour and you will not be disappointed . The museum manages to capture simply the arrival of the Jews to the town and the impact they have had while connecting the visitor to their roots in Eastern Europe. The recreation of the shtels on the lower floor was very well done . Their is a nicely stocked shop and very good cafe as well as a lovely outdoor play area if you are bringing small kids with you."

We decided to eat quickly at the delicious cafe on the property and a little while later the ticket saleswoman walked by us, leaving the property.

This probably heightened the emotions I felt during my visit, especially to the Holocaust Centre. As a South African Jew who has recently returned after many years abroad, I found the museum very interesting, reminding me of the part played by Jews in the history of the country, and also in the anti-Apartheid movement. Beautifully designed and full of interest, I'm not sure how involving it would be for non-Jews. The Holocaust Centre should be compulsory for all young South Africans, as I'm sure many are not really aware of the horrors perpetrated by Germany against Europe's Jews."

There is an opportunity to visit the synagogue, and the first few exhibits are the standard 'This is Judaism' sort of thing, but after that there are some intriguing exhibits. I particularly enjoyed the history of South Africa's Jews, and how and why they moved there from Eastern Europe. There is a replica Lithuanian shtetl which was amazing to see. We also enjoyed the exhibit opened by Nelson Mandela featuring artwork about his connection to the community."

The security man sked if I had any thing sharp I said 'only my wits' and he told me he had heard the reply about a million times so disproving my assertion, just a heads up if you are feeling clever. The museum is in three parts the first is General Jewish religious memorabilia and is mildly interesting. The Second is the history of the Jewish community in South Africa and is fascinating and on the whole very well put together so that some like me who knew little of the subject could learn stuff and I imagine even people steeped in the subject would still find the visit worth while I did feel that a very subtle attempt was made to distance the Jewish community from any possible Apartheid type sins the list of prominent Jewish politicians were all Anti-Apartheid the quote from Mandala about his work for a Jewish law firm highlighted his positive remarks and somewhat skipped over his previous not so praising earlier remark in the same book.  The Third part is a Holocaust display which naturally is only very indirectly concerned with South Africa but although it is a well know story it is told in in very dispassionate manner that even explains the circumstances and motivations for what happened this tone I found a very effecting and maybe for the First time bought the view that is often put that this event could quiet easily happen again in a modern industrialised country if people aren't vigilant ."

The building has been modernised and the exhibitions are more high-tech. Except the little Lithuanian model village, which still creates the same impression of being the abode of a poor but proud people.And clean and neat! There is not a scroll out of place and the examples on exhibit were (for non-Jews) very good examples of what sustained the Jews throughout the Diaspora. And the nice link with the Jewish settlers in South Africa is still there from Cape Town to the Gold Fields.The old 'smouskar' of bygone years is still on view, but unfortunately now it is roped off and one can but gaze at it from behind a barrier instead of inspecting it and the goods that were carried in it close-up.Even the coffee shop outside is a nice touch. Clean and neat, it gives an opportunity to reflect in quiet contemplation. And the guard at the gate (sadly, a modern-day necessity) was friendly yet firm in carrying out his duties. There is still construction work going on and one can but hope that space will be made to exhibit Jewish life in SA in more modern times, not so much in political terms as in the contributions that ordinary people continue to make to add to their forebears' contributions to building a prosperous South Africa.Well worth a visit even if you're not Jewish."

It starts in the first synagogue in South-Africa with the history of the Jewish Community in Cape Town and South-Africa and even has some models of synagogues around South-Africa. Then it moves on to describe the contribution the Jewish people played during the days of Apartheid. Finishing off with famous Jews.Next door is the current synagogue which holds about 1400 people and is really worth the visit. Not just beautiful from the outside, but also stunning from the inside. It reminds me of the portugese synagogue in Amsterdam in some aspects.In the final building there is a coffee shop and a little gift shop, but there is also a holocaust exhibition and a documentary about Nelson Mandela. You can truly spend hours here and the way everything is displayed and made interactive should be an example to other similar museums around the world."

Informative, knowledge sharing displays, including a number of high-tech interactive exhibits. All highlight the history, contributions and suffering of the Jewish in South Africa and across the world. The special Holocaust exhibition was thought-provoking, solemn and spiritual. It certainly reminded me of the atrocities performed against humanity and reinforced the message that it must never happen again!In addition to the actual museum, staff and volunteers at the Centre were most welcoming. All in all, a highly recommended attraction."

Located close to the Mount Nelson hotel, this is not just a museum but a community resource.There was a lot of variety in the exhibits - starting from a synagogue and going on to a museum of Jewish settlement in South Africa and life in Cape Town. There is even a mocked up East European stetl, or hamlet.But the insulation of sounds from one exhibit to another wasn't great - so one of the most interesting elements (the role of the Jewish community in the ANC/political struggles and the Rivonia trial) was impossible to hear.Service in the cafe is slow, and the description of food on the menu misleading (for salad read pickled veg) although it may be more meaningful to an Israeli clientele."

We started with a look at the Shul where we got an idea of the history of the Jews in Cape Town and the building of the Shul. It was a shame we were leaving before Friday night when there was an event on in what seems like a really vibrant community.The museum was interesting and well planned out, including a reconstruction of some buildings in an Eastern European shtetl. The staff were lovely and took time to chat to us. The Holocaust museum was comprehensive and moving. We do always try to get a feel for Jewish communities wherever we are and a museum like this never fails to shock, however many times we learn the history. We were there long after closing time, having been assured by the staff that we could take our time, which showed how sensitive they were to the content and not simply rushing us through. We couldn't fail to notice the frightening similarities between apartheid and the Holocaust, which became a common theme through our trip."

The Museum was built about 3 years ago and is in a complex with a small dairy restaurant that had excellent food, very reasonable prices, there is a place to buy African items, the Holocaust Museum is there, which is visited by the children of Cape Town because there is a direct correlation between the Apartheid era and the Holocaust. Mandela helped raise money for the Jewish Museum because he felt the Jewish community had been instrumental in helping eliminate Apartheid. The Museum itself is beautiful and holds the history of the Jewish people and their contribution to Cape Town. There is a replica of a small village in Eastern Europe which was very interesting to see and an exhibit by a famous artist with the last name of Bak, there as well. Next to the South African Museum is the synagogue that dates back to 1904. It is very beautiful and can hold over 1000 people at one time. The stained glass windows are of the 12 tribes of Israel. If you go to Cape Town, it is a must see. Ricki Bergman, Travel Consultant & World Traveler"

A little additional information, this building is located near to the Holocaust Museum, and there was also this Jewish / Judaism Shop and the small Cafe near to the museum itself. First we purchased the ticket to the lady at the reception, and then we were told some of the procedures, and also we were told not to take photograph inside. Then we went to the museum. I can see many extraordinary legacy there. First we saw the building with many chairs in the middle (which I guess for praying / gathering), and there were those Jewish / Judaism equipment located around the area. They were really sacred. The museum itself has each of the objects explained really well. It was great to know the history of the Jewish Community from the old times, where they show it on the video display there on the screen and we got to know how the Jewish Community came to South Africa. We then went inside to the inner area, we saw other great things about the Jewish Community, including the other objects inside the museum, and also other great videos that shown us about how The Jewish Wedding were held, how the old leaders had the meeting together, and also other impressive things such as the old buildings and equipment. Finally we went to the upstairs area where we saw all the old photographs and the old texts / letters, and we then went to the restaurant outside the museum while we all had the great knowledge about the History of Jewish Community and also for the old times and what had happened in the past."

The short video about Mandela and his relationship with South African Jewry was also very good. The gift shop is also good, as is the cafe.My only complaint is that the museum was not extensive enough. The discussion of the Oppenheimers was incredibly brief and the section on Jews who fought against Apartheid was far too small. There was a little bit about Helen Suzman but nothing at all about Joe Slovo or Lionel 'Rusty' Bernstein except for a brief mention of Slovo on a computer terminal listing prominent South African Jews.

The museum is housed in a former synagogue and although not much has been added to it since my last visit here two years ago, it\u2019s pleasing to see it being so diligently maintained and carefully looked after. The entrance fee is a modest R40 as at June 2013 (equiv $US4). The museum has its own parking facility, a few metres up the road before you hit the museum coming down Hatfield Road. For more details about it, it\u2019s best to call beforehand because it\u2019s easy to miss it. I did, and ended up parking in the Art Gallery car park a few metres past the museum although that wasn\u2019t too much of a drama as it\u2019s nearby and you just throw the parking attendant a few coins when you leave.This being a Jewish facility and in crime-ridden South Africa to boot it\u2019s understandable that security is tight. So it\u2019s wise to have some ID with you (such as passport or driver\u2019s licence) and be prepared for a bag search and a few questions. But it won\u2019t hold you up more than a couple of minutes and I always find the guards to be polite and businesslike. They even helped with directions to my next destination on my way out.Once inside, take your time to meander around and enjoy all the exhibits that trace the history of this vibrant, loyal and productive community from its earliest days in the Cape Colony at the start of the 19th century, through to mass immigration that swelled the Jewish population to over 40,000 between about 1890 and 1936, when restrictions were placed on further immigration by a pro-German white govt. At its peak, the Jewish community of SA numbered about 120,000 and at one time comprised almost 5% of the white population. There is also a strong focus on the involvement of the community in the anti-apartheid movement. Nelson Mandela\u2019s first employers in Johannesburg were Jewish and he never forgot that, maintaining a strong affinity and respect for the Jewish community throughout his career. And it was he who officially opened the museum in 2000.There is an interesting exhibition downstairs of ancient Japanese miniature artwork, collected by a prominent Jewish South African and donated to the museum. Plus a photo exhibition by Paul Weinberg, recording his travels through the countryside where his forebears once lived and had businesses.I was excited to find a book listing all the Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s who arrived at the Cape Colony between 1890 and 1905. There is a second volume of arrivals between 1905 and 1936.Don\u2019t forget to visit the little shop afterwards which has a small but interesting collection of books and other knick knacks and of course Caf\u00e9 Riteve for a sandwich and coffee. The staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming to all visitors. Being a Jewish ex-Capetonian, I always find this museum a joy to visit. It\u2019s a moving experience that can bring a tear to your eye. It isn\u2019t large and you should be able to cover it in about two hours."

Still the fantastic number of photos and memorabilia and easy to read quotes and captions made this a top place to visit. We found the District 6 information to be easier to read and access than in the actual District 6 Museum, where it seemed to be wall to wall newspaper selections and hard to decide what to read. Next to this museum is the Holocaust museum, also a VERY well done history--concise and thorough. I learned more here than at the US Holocaust museum, maybe because it was so concise. We were told 30 minutes in the Holocaust museum (perfect for my friends--I took about 40 minutes) and about an hour in the Jewish Museum. BUt BE SURE to leave time for the 27 minute film interview with Mandela which covered Jewish history intertwined with ANC and anti-apartheid activities. An excellent movie, not available elsewhere. Easy to hear and see as it's in a small auditorium. Again, we learned more here than at the District 6 museum and Bo Kapp museum together (though both are definitely worth visiting)."

There was so much to read and see, our 1 1/2 hours there flew by. Unfortunately, time did not allow for us to tour the holocaust museum but we did have a few minutes to check out the small gift shop where I bought a beautiful metal art piece at a reasonable price hand made in Cape town. A cafe in the same building had snacks and drinks which my mom enjoyed. My only regret is that we ran out of time as the museum closes promptly at 5:00pm. To do this museum right, please allow at least 2-3 hours. We decided to walk back to the V & A Waterfront which turned out to be a nice walk, all downhill, and took us about 45 minutes. Don't do this walk after dark as once the business district closes down, it is unwise to stroll the streets in this area."

The museum was closed for refurbishment when I arrived in Cape Town at the end of July but open when I was back in late August. Very well laid out with good graphics, visuals and audio telling the story of the Jews in the Cape and the experience of European Jews in the 1939-1945 holocaust. Many survivors made their way to South Africa so there is plenty of personal testimony.I spent 4 hours in the museum which is some testimony to its interest. After 4 weeks along the western Cape and Garden Route, this was the best museum I visited"

The South African Jewish Museum sits opposite the Holocaust Museum, and the Great Synagogue sits behind them. There is a clear progression through the museums and the displays are informative.  While it will certainly be interesting and relevant to Jewish people, including a very extensive history of Jews in South Africa, there is enough there for everyone to enjoy. Worth a look."

The entrance however is in Hatfield Street, with no obvious access from the Gardens. However, there is a dirt road pedestrians can cut across, just past the museum, which takes you out onto Hatfield Street. The Museum, Synagogue and shop/cafe is set in a compound, and you will need personal ID to get through the security, sign a logbook, and enter the compound. The first impression is that the compound is extremely clean, tidy and well kept. There was a very helpful friendly lady who took us into the synagogue, and, not being of the Jewish faith, spent some time explaining the set up and working of the synagogue. She was a gem, and we learnt a lot.The museum is part of the first synagogue built Cape Town. It is well laid out, and worth a visit, telling the story of where the community came from and how they integrated into the South African culture.We had lunch at the cafe before visiting the holocaust museum. It is interesting but at the same time also shocking and left you with a sad feeling and ashamed at what humans(nations) can do when they believe they are right. Also so amazing to realize that with the help of God a nation was saved again although so many had to suffer and die as a result."

Both are filled with lots of history, art, and interesting exhibits.

It was very detailed and presented in a fabulous way. As a teacher, I was very pleased to be able to buy some educational resources too.We highly recommend this museum combination, but we were quite emotionally exhausted afterwards."

The Jewish museum and Holocaust museum are set in a secure compound just off the Company's Gardens, but access is round the other side, on Hatfield Street. It's a bit of a strange experience entering the museum, as unlike the others, you have to present your ID or passport first, which will be checked and noted, before you pass through a turnstile into the compound. It is slightly off-putting, but I imagine there are sound reasons for the tight security. Don't let it put you off going though - non-Jewish people are very welcome to visit and once inside, I was made to feel extremely welcome. Initially I looked at the working synagogue, interesting if you not familiar with the layout and quite old, end of the 19th century I believe. Then I went into the museum proper, which starts off in the very first synagogue which opened in SA and has displays explaining some of the tenets and practices of the Jewish faith. Further along there are displays explaning the history of Jewish immigration to SA, political issues, prominent South African Jews, and other material.Downstairs there is a reconstruction of a Lithuanian shtetl - a small wooden village, as apparently most SA Jews came originally from Lithuania. It's quite atmospheric and you can wander around. Finally there is a temporary exhibition space.I didn't visit the Holocaust museum, but that is on the same site along with a gift shop and a kosher cafe. Generally I found it all interesting although I wouldn't say it was the best museum I've ever been to. Anyone who has particular interests in Judaism should obviously take a look and it's a good eye-opening experience for non-Jews."

This museum is one of the stops on the Cape Town Hop On/Off tour bus although we walked there from the city centre and caught the bus afterwards.A discount for entry is given to holders of the hop on/off ticket.It is quite a hard museum to find owing to the fact that it has a security entry and in a fully fenced compound.We think there is only one entry point and they screen everyone coming into the grounds here.Security personnel are thorough but friendly and you must sign in and out and go through a small portal.This didn't worry us in the least as they are only doing their job.The grounds are lovely and the old synagogue is a white building with an entry near the park to see the rest of the museum. We did not see another entry point (if they have one.)Here you pay the 50 Rand entry (full price) and photos are allowed of all the beautiful ceremonial items on display with explanations of their use in Judaism ritual.Cameras and movie cameras must be turned off after that part of the museum.The old Synagogue architecture is lovely and an interesting presentation of Nelson Mandela and the story of the Jewish struggle and life in South Africa is on an upper level.Walking down the unusual winding ramp you have another very good exhibition of 'the Shtetl ', a look in the life of an eastern European Jewish village.... wonderful!Also along the downstairs walls are many photographs and art, most of which relates to the struggle during Apartheid. Restrooms are here at this level.The holocaust memorial and information is in another building however we did not have time to visit.A modern cafe and gift shop are located in the grounds and although food is limited to a small choice, it is still very good.The gift shop sells a variety of items, including Judaica, South African items and books.We found this museum outstanding. It is a comprehensive and factual insight into Judaism in South Africa as well as a look into the struggle for independence.Enjoy your visit!"
