The panoramas are fabulous and you get a fantastic view of Castelo de Sao Jorge on the opposite hill. There is plenty of benches to sit down and relax, beautiful large trees and shade, a pretty fountain, a garden below, numerous kiosk vending interesting crafts, overall it is a great place to visit and a must-do while in Lisbon."

As well as the amazing views there is a little kiosk and a big square where you can sit and watch the world go by. There's also some stairs which take you down to a little park and another kiosk. For me this is the best view point in Lisbon."

We missed it when we exited the elevador to the left, but retraced our tracks when we realized we'd missed it.The first thing one notices about this park is the views of the city, a virtual 180+ degree view looking eastward. The most dominant view is of Castelo de Sao Jorge, towering high over the Alfama and the rest of the town. This is also the perfect spot to gaze over the countless red tile rooftops covering most of the city.So glad we didn't miss this park!"

A very pleasant place having a lot of trees, benches, a fountain, caf\u00e9, gift kiosks and a great spectacular view to the city center which lies underneath. The place has two terraces: the upper one having all the above and with the most of visitors, and the lower one, more quiet. I would recommend to visit the lower one after 5 PM, when there is a natural shade from the wall, or after sunset \u2013 the view to the night Lisbon is also great! It is situated in the old historical part of the city, where I advise to get lost in, and just to stroll all the narrow streets."

We took the Blue Line down to the city centre, ate some dinner, then took the funicular from Avenida da Liberdade up to the Bairro Alto. Immediately to your right as you exit the funicular sits the Miradouro Sao Pedro de Alcantara. We strolled this lovely park at about 21.00h - as the temperatures dropped. Outdoor vendors sold beer, food and hand-made items, a caffe on the far end was showing the France-Iceland Euro2016 quarterfinal. Plenty benches to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. And the view of Lisbon? Gorgeous. A great photo spot. I've been told the area gets seedy as night goes on and the young people like to drink to drunkenness up in that area. Perhaps I would have wanted to experience that 30 years ago! Instead, we headed back down to the Praca dos Restauradores and strolled a bit more. It was Sunday and the city was quiet and vibrant but at a certain leisure that brought calm."

There are seats or you can just stand and admire the eastern part of Lisbon, looking down to Rossio or over to Castelo de Sao Jorge in the distance. It is a nice view point if you are planning to visit this area of the city.During our visit, there was a holiday fair taking place with quite a few food and drink stands sit up at Miradouro Sao Pedro de Alcantara.

At the far end of the view point is this kiosk - service is friendly and the menu is suitable for all day. The toasties on rustic bread are large enough to share unless you are very hungry. The soup is home-made and a good option. The trees offer welcoming shade and the kiosk has a toilet for customers."

The four of us are expats living in Lisbon, and had visited this kiosk previously on multiple occasions without incident. However, tonight we were charged for a bottle of wine we did not order, and when this error was brought to the manager's attention, he refused to discount the bill, threatened to call the police, and banned us from frequenting the kiosk in the future. To be clear, my friends and I legitimately ordered over 90 euro worth of food and drinks, so the issue wasn't an unwillingness or inability to pay. However, we were absolutely not going to pay an additional 20 euro for wine we did not order. Unfortunately, the server attending to us came to the end of his shift before we were ready to pay our bills, as he could have confirmed the legitimacy of our claim. Certainly the view from this location is wonderful, but based on my most recent experience with the upper level kiosk, I suggest visiting elsewhere for drinks and snacks. Thankfully, there are a variety of other options nearby and I doubt they will charge you unfairly."

We tried all three at different times and they each had their own charm (well, not the elevator - it was just an elevator, but it did take us up). Once you're up there, the view is really quite nice."

My advice would be to take the metro to Rato Metro Station, and from there walk downhill to Miradouro Sao Pedro de Alcantara. Much easier that way, without arriving completely exhausted... enjoy!"

The view of St.George Castle is magnificent and the river is visible as well, so it makes for a very nice photograph. One may bring some picnic or wine here and just sit and enjoy the view. Very lovely. There is a funicular very close by, so one can take it up and end up close to the lookout. Because of the lights around St. George Castle at night, this lookout is even nicer in the evening - go both during the day and in the evening if you can.

It's an easy ride up from the Restauradores metro stop on the funicular (a little hard to find, but it's on a side street off of Av. da Liberdade), or a steep walk uphill from the Bairro Alto. We were in Lisbon during an unusually hot stretch in June (95 F every day), so the lovely park with lots of glorious shade and a fountain was a welcome sight. I particularly like this lookout spot because you can see the water, the Alfama, and the Baixa Chiado from here. Unfortunately the top of the Rossio train station is quite prominent and is hideous. But just look beyond that and pretend it's not there :)After taking in the view here, we walked down the Rua da Misericordia into the heart of the Bairro Alto. All in all, the trip up and then down made for a very pleasant afternoon.* If you like my review, I appreciate you clicking the 'helpful' button; those of us who take the time to write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more :) *"

I have driven from Alvor, Algarve all the way to Lisbon and we were exploring the city. This was our last stop before driving back to Algarve again. It was quite daunting to find a parking space nearby but I finally managed to park on a very hilly side street. The place itself was very romantic and we could rest after the stressful parking incident and trying to cope with the weekend traffic in Lisbon which was quite annoying not because it's busy which it isn't that bad but the people in Lisbon make it awful with their behaviour whilst behind the wheel. Apart from the evening breath taking views there's also a small caf\u00e9 with a nice pastel de nata and a tasty espresso caf\u00e9. I also had a caipirinha but it wasn't that tasty! Looking @ Lisbon listening to Brazilian Bossa Nova. They also provide blankets at this caf\u00e9 for people that feel a bit chilly :) Recommended to couples that need a romantic time out, Lisbon is quite sexy but get a cab :)"

I happened upon my first one entirely by accident. This was my second, but it's arguably the best in Lisbon, with a marvelous view of the city and across to the castle on the next hill."

The views of Lisbon can't be beat, and there's an outstanding cafe where you can enjoy a nice lunch or afternoon coffee while watching the tourists and passers-by.Most of the lunch items at the cafe are simple, like toasted sandwiches, but they're tasty and not at all expensive. When the weather is nice, it's probably one of the best places to sit out and enjoy the day."

I strongly recommend this place to everyone, even at night to take a drink.The view over Lisbon is fantastic! Whether you can watch all the old part of Lisbon as the Castle of S\u00e3o Jorge and Restauradores, you can see as well more modern areas - Saldanha."
