We spent a lovely day discovering traditions in Asakusa, electronic city in Akihabara, fun sushi lunch in Shibuya, peaceful Meiji shrine and shopping in Harajuku. It was a great decision to book this tour on the first full day in Tokyo so we could get a good sense of the different areas straight away. Yuriko was a fantastic guide, she answered all of our questions and it was just a very enjoyable day chatting with her. Thanks so much Yuriko, it will be a day we will never forget!"

Having only one full day to spend in Tokyo, my husband and I thought it would be sensible to spend it with a knowledgeable person who could show us some of the highlights of the city and give us a short introduction to the city and Japanese culture and history. Keiko, with whom we had the privilege to spend our day yesterday, gave us all that and more, going to great lengths to make sure we enjoyed our day to the full (even trying in advance the restaurant she recommended for lunch and suggesting the best side to sit in the boat trip) . She kept us entertained all day with pleasant and interesting conversation about every subject we were interested in, and in the meantime making sure we were comfortable, received all the information she had prepared in advance and saw all the sights which had been planned. She kept to the timetable without rushing us and we felt we indeed made the right choice in spending our day in Tokyo with Keiko."

Our guide Yakko really went out of her way to show us so many different aspects of Japanese culture and was extremely knowledgable about the many places we visited. We left with a deeper appreciation of Japanese culture and a love for Tokyo. We especially liked that Yakko listened to us and made additional recommendations each day which were perfect for us and so much fun! We will be back and definitely use Yakko and Travelience again. Thank you!!!"

We saw the highlights of Tokyo and got a lot of information about the city, the history and the culture. Our guide was really friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. The tour is a perfect opportunity to discover the city on the first day as doing it on your own can be a bit overwhelming. We are very happy that we did it and really recommend it to anyone!"

Travelience support team always responded within 24 hrs and wes very organized and helpful. Our tour with Norico was full of historical, personal, and cultural connections. She discussed and adjusted our plan for the day easily. For our first and very short trip here, she was able to share historical background and not just the facts, giving us exactly what we were looking for--a personal feel for the city. She was able in 8 hrs. with us to share tons of history, traditions, customs, and evolving changes in this modern yet very traditional conglomerate of the city. We got to see Tsukiji imarket \"inside and out\", while learning about its history and evolving transitions. We enjoyed a wonderful sushi lunch at Sushisay. We saw the Asakusa area and walked around Sensoji, talking about the slow interwoven blend of Shinto and Buddhist religions evolving with good or tough times for Japanese, allowing peaceful coexistence of religions. Even street market was an opportunity to look at the tradition and people that carried them through the years. We went to a beautiful Hama-rikyu Garden and worked our way through traditional Matchu tea ceremony, taking in the quiet meditative park design sustained in the middle of booming economic modernity. We went to Ginza neighborhood to get the feel for shoppers rushing by and then to see Meiji shrine, and she did a great job again including the people of the temple and their daily life into our tour. We ended the tour with her graciously taking us to a wonderful traditional Japanese restaurant and talking us through many menu options, as well as handing us maps for shopping and directions to get home. All day, we traveled by subway allowing us to get many short glimpses at behaviors and customs she whole-heartedly talked to us about. I feel she did an impossible job of connecting our many interests with life, history, and customs of Tokyo in 8 hrs, stopping for a snack or a break just enough to make them a part of the experience. We loved every minute of it, and of the interaction. I could not give higher recommendation for a travel company and a guide. We would love to spend more time with Narico!"

            "review": "A tour - but above and beyond!. We spent our first day in Japan with our Travelience tour guide, Mayumi, and it was just fantastic! We opted for a private tour for the 5 of us, and it was reasonably priced. Mayumi was so prepared and asked in advance via email about our interests, then created a suggested itinerary (with our input). She knew that my two youngest girls - ages 12 and 15 - were interested in the more funky Harajuku type experiences, but we had to balance it with the interests of my 17 year old son and his dad. She called ahead to make reservations for us, and had excellent suggestions of historical sites, shopping and restaurants to explore on our own. We felt we had an amazing overview of Tokyo in just one day! I highly recommend a tour for your first day or two to help acclimate yourself. Mayumi even followed up with an email after the tour as she had done some research into gluten-free restaurant options for one of our group. Talk about service above and beyond! We so appreciated our time with Mayumi who not only shared many highlights with us but also gave us a real look into life in Tokyo."

            "review": "Perfect Experience thanks to our guide.. My family and I had 1 full day in Japan and we were looking for a tour to see as much as possible. Thanks to Travelience, that happened.Our guide, Keiko Sasaki, met us at the airport in Haneda at 8AM and had a full day planned for us based on the specifics we wanted to do. She was so accommodating and even arranged for our luggage to be taken to our airport hotel in Narita via courier so we did not have to carry it around all day long.Once she met us, she took us via train to Tokyo where we spent the day in the city visiting J-World, Akihabara, Asakusa Temple and a few other places we had wanted to see. Keiko was amazing in every way. She scouted out the places my family wished to visit prior to our arrival, was in constant contact before our trip and made the most of every second of our day. My children will never forget the short time we had in Japan and certainly wish to return one day. On a side note, due to some of the sight seeing, we were about 5 minutes late to our last train which would have made us wait about 45 minutes to catch our bus to our hotel. Keiko quickly thought of a way to avoid that delay but taking us to the Narita Airport stop, and then catching the shuttle to the hotel. This was brilliant and went perfectly as we made it to the hotel much quicker for some rest before our long journey home!I would recommend this company to anyone looking for top notch experience in Japan, catered to what you want to see. Thanks again!"

We were able to see all of the major sites in about 8 hours. Our two kids (4 & 8 yrs old) were able to make it, although completely exhausted by the end of the tour. This was a very informative and efficient way to see Tokyo. There are other options such as the hop on/hop off bus tour but having a tour guide that speaks English really well was invaluable. I would highly recommend this tour company."

            "review": "Excellent experience!. We travelled to Tokyo a couple of weeks ago and we spent 3 full days with Yuriko as part of private tours and I want to say that this is the best decision I've ever made! This is our family's first trip to Japan. My friend used Travelience last year and she recommended them to me when I told her about our plan to travel to Tokyo. From the moment I got in touch with Emi in February, I sensed that it was a legitimate company. Emi was prompt, professional and courteous with all of her correspondence. She answered all of my questions, made great suggestions/ recommendations and worked with my family's needs as I told her I'll be traveling with young kids and an elderly mother. I had in our party myself, my husband, 2 kids, elderly Mom and a cousin. She made the itinerary for me once I told her what we wanted to visit. I actually just contacted her for a one day private tour but it ended up being 3 full days as I really felt that I could get the best of our short stay in Tokyo if we had a professional guide to help us along the way. I settled my payment about two weeks before our trip and she assigned Yuriko to our group. I contacted her shortly thereafter and she responded right away as well.On the first day of our tour, she met us at the lobby of our hotel in Shinjuku and from there we navigated the Tokyo public transportation system. It is very intimidating as someone from California who doesn't use public transportation and a non- Japanese speaker on top of that! With Yuriko, we just gave her the money for fare and she knew where and when to get off the subway, train and bus. She was so pleasant to work with, had a good command of the English language and was very patient with my young daughter and Mom who at some point got so tired from all the walking! Our itinerary included 2 days in Tokyo and one day in Kamakura to see the the Great Buddha. My Mom skipped the 3rd day as she was very tired for the first two days so keep in mind that there will be lots and lots of walking. We also had to cut our Kamakura tour short as there was no way she could continue to walk without assistance as it was a very long day and her feet began to hurt. We missed going to the Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine because of this. Overall we had a great time and I highly recommend this company. We wouldn't have seen 1/2 of the sites we went to if we didn't have Yuriko with us. On our fourth day, we ventured on our own and I had made advanced reservations to see the Imperial Palace grounds. We went to the site without any problem but going back to the hotel, we got lost big time and spent a great deal of time figuring how to get back. It was then I realized that we got so used with Yuriko and she made it less stressful the first 3 days. I appreciated her even more after that experience. I just want to say thank you for making our trip memorable. My cousin who came with us has been to Japan several times before and she commented that I did a great job of getting a tour guide after she had a great experience as well. Apparently, on her previous trips she just did a DIY and she didn't see as much nor learned about some history/ back stories. It was worth every penny getting them and I truly recommend Travelience/ Yuriko to anyone who's going to visit Tokyo. I'm glad I listened to my friend. "

            "review": "Two GREAT days with Noriko!. Our family only had 3 full days in Tokyo so we wanted to try to pack as much in as possible in a short period of time. We arranged for two private tours for our 1st and 3rd day. We had arrived the night before so we hadn't had time to purchase Pasmo cards so she helped us with that since we would be using them all day. Our first day we did Sensoji Temple, Asakusa shrine, Nakamise street, Akihabara sightseeing, lunch at a fun conveyor belt sushi restaurant, Shibuya sightseeing (famous crossing, Hachiko dog statue), & Meiji Jingu shrine. I had mentioned to Noriko that I was interested in getting a Bao Bao bag so she took us to the Issey Miyake store so I could get one. She also was a huge help in making our train reservations. We were headed to Kyoto 3 days later so we went to a JR office and she basically made them for us. The person working did not speak English so it would have been very difficult to communicate our needs. Our 3rd day was the family's favorite...a day trip to Kamakura. She met us at our hotel and it took about 1 1/2 hours via metro/train to get there. We first went to Hasedera Temple and to see the Great Buddha. She took us to a great soba noodle restaurant for lunch. I'm a vegetarian and I had one of the most amazing meals of the trip there. After lunch we went to Hokoku-ji Temple and Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine. It was a long day but so different than what we had seen before.....we absolutely loved it. This was our first time in Japan and we were a little nervous about the language barrier. Having Noriko get us familiar with the city and the metro was a huge help and really put us at ease. Our 2nd day we were on our own and went all over the city using the metro and went to a baseball game that night (highly recommend!). I appreciated the prompt communication with the company when booking the tours and also with Noriko when our trip got closer. She even sent us a picture of herself so we would be able to spot her in the lobby which was thoughtful. I highly recommend Noriko and Travelience."

I thought the tour was a great introduction to the city's various neighborhoods, and conveniently we visited a ton of popular sites in Tokyo over the 6 hours or so, including Meiji Shrine and Senso-ji. Despite this being a group tour, there was only one other gentleman who had signed up, so we each had plenty of time to ask questions. Our guide (who I believe was named Manami) was friendly and had a good sense of humor. She was knowledgable of the sites we visited and handled all of our questions well. This tour was also a good way to stay awake and beat the jet lag since it involves constant walking. The sushi restaurant for lunch was also hilarious (observe how the kitchen sends your food out) and tasty. Kudos to Manami who also stayed with me after the tour to write down several suggestions for shopping and tea stores."

After helping us buy a one day ticket for the subway, we were on our way visiting the Sensoji Temple, Nakamise shopping area, Hamarikyu garden and tea ceremony, a relaxing river cruise, Ginza sightseeing and lunch, Meiji Temple, Shibuya crossing and Hachiko statue (we have an Akita). She was very informative about the history, culture and everyday life. It was great to have a private guide considering we knew no Japanese and had never been to Tokyo. It was also a breeze using public transportation. We paid for the tour in advance through pay pal.

From start to finish, our experience with Travelience, Akane (trip planner), and Kanae (tour guide) was outstanding.During the planning phase, we communicated primarily with the trip planner, Akane. Akane wrote in clear, professional English and she always responded quickly. We sent her a list of personal interests which she synthesized into a travel itinerary that nicely suited our diverse interests.Our tour guide, Kanae, did a wonderful job. She speaks English clearly, and we did not have any trouble understanding her. Our tour encompassed a lot of different locations -- the Tsukiji Fish Market, Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines, panoramic views of the city -- and Kanae was well-prepared to talk about each location. She was comfortable discussing history and religion as well as matters of modern-day culture and arts. She even helped us by recommending good snacks and sake to bring as gifts for our friends back home. In addition to her efforts on the tour, Kanae was considerate of our trip as a whole. For example, she helped us book tickets on the Shinkansen to visit Himeji, Kyoto, and Hiroshima and prepared notes with routs and stations to help us navigate the confusing public transportation. Kanae was a special part of our first trip to Japan, and we are really grateful she was our tour guide.All the best,Liam, Connie, and LaTanya"

She took us to a sushi restaurant where the 'locals' go. Huge lunch, super delicious, $10 for THREE of us!!  At the end of the tour, she knew we were going to have to take the train back to the airport by ourselves. She had maps, diagrams, and written instructions prepared for our return trip!

Even my son who is usually very shy to stranger get along with her very well and at the end of the tour, he was kind of sad that we had to part. This is a sightseeing tour which we ride quite a few different type of transportation, I won't go into details here as I will leave that for you guys to experience. It was our lucky day as we get to see Mount Fuji from hakone and it's a clear view as well! During the journey while we were on the train, we get to learn more about japanese society and their culture, and the various thing a japanese family do from yakko-san. She also takes very good care of our son and my son had so much fun playing with her. I will definately recommend this tour and it's worth every penny."

Travelience send us Miki and she showed us Tokyo for nearly 9 hours. We had a really great day and visited the Tsukiji fish market, had lunch there with the best sushi ever, Hamarikyu garden, Asakusa sightseeing, river cruise on the Sumida river, imperial palace and tokyo tower. She told us a lot of the history and the background information of the sights and about actual life in tokyo. We had our first japanese tea session and could ask about everything. She also helped us organise the following days in Tokyo and explained us how to travel with the subway and railsystem. It was perfect.So thanks again. We will come again."

Loved exploring the city with her and enjoyed every minute we had with her. I don't think we could have navigated Tokyo and surrounding areas without her. When we told her we were going to Kyoto next, she offered to help us purchase our tickets to Kyoto and ensured we'd have seats together and that we'd be on the side that could see Mt. Fuji, which was very thoughtful. Kanae truly made our trip to Tokyo. Highly recommend Travelience for a special trip!"

With only a very short time to see Tokyo, we decided to hire a tour guide from Travelience for our first day. We prioritized what we wanted to see beforehand and Travelience helped us create our own personal itinerary. We were introduced to our guide Michiyo by email and immediately found her to be helpful and prompt to reply. Once we met Michiyo in person we saw that she was personable and comfortable to be with. Her English was excellent. Best of all, she was very knowledgeable about what we were seeing and taught us a lot about Japanese culture. Thanks to Michiyo we were able to overcome the fact that we didn't speak Japanese, learn from her how to use the subway system, and have a very personal introduction to a fascinating city.

I thought the tours were acceptable. Both days the group had about six people. The guide was a very friendly and sweet woman. She also happily took questions. Still, she had a low energy vibe and was hard to hear. She recited basic information about each site (sometimes furthering and referring to her handwritten notes). There was little in the way of interesting stories (historical or personal). She also didn't give a great deal of historical context. Sometimes she wasn't entirely confident which way exit a subway station or find the next attraction. Perhaps she is new at this. Her English was fine but she didn't have a colloquial command of the language. As for the sights: I'd scrape the Imperial Palace because you just stand in front of the entrance for twenty minutes. You don't see anything. It's anti-climatic. Of the tour tours, the Tokyo Traditions one was better because a lot of the other tour you could do on your own (e.g. fish market, gardens, standing outside the palace, etc..)"

We did a private tour because we have a 2 year old with us and it was one of the best decisions we've made during our trip to Japan! We got to plan out which stops/attractions we wanted to visit in Tokyo through the company. Keiko did a fantastic job planning our stops very thoroughly. Keiko was very friendly and planned everything so well, including bus times and how long each leg would take. She even went out of her way to plan other festivals or events that was going on in the area that we might be interested in going to. She went above and beyond what we expected from the tour. It was a trip of a lifetime in Japan for our family and booking this tour made our lives so much easier! Keiko was so helpful with the language barrier and helped us looked for different souvenirs and goodies I was looking for in Japan for family members. Lunch at the fish market was the best sushi I've ever had. The fish was so fresh because it was in the vicinity of the fish market. We've visited different shrines/temples around Tokyo as well. Keiko took us to a Japanese store that specializes in different Japanese nicknacks/souvenirs. She even went as far as to scope out the area that we wanted to explore because she had not been there before. That is GREAT planning on her part! I want to thank her for everything she did for us and how much easier she made our first trip to Tokyo! I will definitely recommend Travelience to our friends/family in the future for tours!"

Miki met the three of us right on time and we found out no one else had signed up, so we had a private tour! She was very sweet and informative. We started at the Fish Market, which was fantastic, then walked back to the Hamariku Garden and had traditional green tea in their tea house. I did not even realize that I could see the garden from my hotel window until I returned! We went on to have lunch, saw the Imperial palace, and the Zojoji Temple. We opted not to go up the Tokyo tower, because we were exhausted. The tour is very informative, but a few things I should mention. We went to the Imperial palace, but could only walk to the outside and see the bridge. I felt that was not necessary and if had understood that we could not see more, perhaps we could have gone elsewhere. The tour involves a ton of walking and riding the subway, so if you cannot handle 6 hours of walking, opt for a bus tour. Miki did a great job in showing us how to use the subway because we needed to use it the rest of the time in Tokyo. The price was very reasonable and the tour well planned out. I also liked that is was just a small group. I would recommend this company if you want a good overview of Tokyo. If you want to see other areas, then book a custom tour."

He accommodated our schedule so we could go to an ATM. We had little time to plan our trip to Tokyo, so getting a private guide and having the trip itinerary planned for us for the day was really really nice. A few things we enjoyed less about this tour, which is why we thought it to be average. The itinerary did not allow for any time to stop and enjoy the sights. We rushed through the Hamarikyu gardens and having traditional tea, several neat cemeteries, and a cool local shopping area. Perhaps this was because it was extremely hot on our tour day. Also, FYI, not only do you have to pay for your guide\u2019s transportation fees (stated clearly on the website), but you also have to buy your guide's lunch and entrance fees. These latter fees were a surprise to us and not clearly stated on the website. I would recommend the tour company add these expenses into the cost of the tour and allow the guide to then purchase these things on behalf of the customer, and also add in some time to explore during the itinerary. Overall, our tour guide was very nice and all spots on our itinerary were visited efficiently and on time."

Private tours are the best way to go because they give you much more freedom over your time. You are never rushed to get back on the bus with the group. If you want to spend a little extra time picking out souvenirs, no problem. Our first two tours were with Kanae. She did a fantastic job explaining the different shrines and temples, painting a picture of what life was like hundreds of years ago. Additionally, she gave us great ideas on how to spend our free time in Tokyo. Our second tour guide was Makoto, and did a wonderful job taking us to Nikko and Edo Wonderland. I highly recommend Travelience, and you would be lucky to have either Kanae or Makoto as your guides."

Our tour guide, Yakko, was very pleasant and provided a great experience. Given that we visited Tokyo during the rainy season, the originally planned itinerary was modified a bit, but it turned out to be a good idea. However, Yakko consulted with us to make sure we were ok with changes. She answered all of our questions during the tour related to the sites we visited, plus general questions we had as to how to go about enjoying the city on our own after the tour. The pace of the tour was comfortable, but we were able to cover a lot. Highlight included visiting the temples in Asakusa, and taking part in an improvised summer tradition of eating noodles from a big bamboo shoot. Pretty cool and random! Plus the sushi we ate around the fish market was divine!! Great service, Yakko! Note - the cost of the tour basically includes the service of the guide. It does not cover subway fares, meals, price to visit attractions, etc. Seems that many of the tours in Tokyo operate the same way, given that we booked a different tour with a different provider. Tipping - based on everything I read, tipping is not required in Tokyo (and Japan for the most part). The cost of the tour takes into account salaries and tips, very different from the service industry in the US. We greatly enjoyed not having to tip everyone we came across in Tokyo, although you pay a bit more upfront for everything."

In the first 48 hours with our guide Yuriko we got to see so many things and visit so many places. There is no way my wife and I could have seen nearly anything close to that amount. It's like having a good friend in the city your visiting. They know exactly where to go and the quickest way to get there so you save so much time. She knew which subways to take, which streets to walk down and what areas and restaurants were a good place for my wife and me. She was always on time and so nice.Have you seen Tokyo's Subway and train map? It's very intimidating at first glance but with the help of Yuriko my wife and I were riding it on our own by the third day. We also had another tour guide Yakko for the fish market tour. She was a sweetheart too. She met us at 3 am and was incredibly energetic and caring even at that hour. She broughts portable chairs and snacks for our two and a half hour wait for the tuna auction and recommended us to a great sushi restaurant and knife shop at the fish market.Bottom line you'll see three to four times as much stuff and you'll have less to plan and less to worry about and more time to enjoy Tokyo with a guide from Travelience. The money is well worth it and I would recommend them for sure."

In order to be fair in this review, I need to separate the tour agency from the tour guide.First, the agency: The experience of setting up the tour was excellent. Akane was on top of all of my plans and helped me plan a great tour plan. The payment process was straightforward, and all that was promised was delivered.Now about the guide.... I won't use the guide's name on purpose. The guide was very sweet lady. She tried really hard to be helpful and nice. However, we felt that she was completely unprepared as a guide. Her English was slightly better than basic. She continuously couldn't find the right English words. Her continuous mispronunciation of basic English words made it very difficult to understand her. I would be okay with her English if she would try to tell us something that wasn't just obvious. She provided practically no historical or outside perspectives. She would point at a building and say the name of the building. She wouldn't describe it, or explain its significance. She took us to the fish market at 11:00 AM (our tour started at 10:00 AM) even though the market closes down at 9:00 AM. We saw lots of empty dirty boxes instead of fish. If we were told of this by the agency, we would have started the tour earlier. The customer (me) isn't always right, especially if the customer doesn't know these nuances. :-)We would walk around the tourist sites and she would be totally quiet. We would have gotten more out of those provided taped tours, but we felt it would be impolite to rent them in front of her.My wife and I felt that we did not get our money's worth, and were all too glad when the tour was over. Though we paid for 10-hour tour, we asked to be taken back to our hotel after about 7 hours. She did mention that she was relatively new to the tour guide industry, but that was no excuse for being unprepared, in my opinion, as a tour guide.Final thoughts. I would recommend this agency, however, make sure that you request a guide that is either named in these reviews or someone with many years of guiding experience. If they cannot guarantee you a competent guide, go somewhere else."

            "review": "Private guides tour of Tokyo. We had such a splendid couple of days with our private guide in Tokyo, Makoto-san.Firstly, Emi-san did an amazing job of settling an itinerary and choosing a guide for us (family of 5 with three teenage boys). She was endlessly patient and helpful.On the first day tour we saw bonsai nurseries, Omiya bonsai museum, sightseeing in Shibuya (and lunch at the amazing automated Genki Sushi restaurant), Meiji Jingu Shrine, Harajuku sightseeing and woodblock print shopping. On the second day we went to Tsukiji fish market, Asukusa sightseeing ( Sensoji temple and Nakamise Street), and Ginza.Makoto-san was very attentive, informative and had a good sense of humour. He had a relaxed, yet professional style that was a perfect fit for Australian travellers like us. I do suspect he was not too fond of guiding our youngest teens (12 and 14 years old) so he is probably best suited for late teens and adults. We strongly recommend Travelience as a high quality touring company, and Makoto-san as a terrific guide. "

This was a perfect opportunity to fine tune what we wanted to see on our \"All Day City Tour of Tokyo\". Yakko Hamabama, provided many ideas/suggestions for our tour. When we had questions, she answered them quickly and always made us understand that we were in charge of our time. This, all before we were even in Tokyo. This helped save precious time when we would actually be on our tour.When on our tour, Yakko provided all we needed or wanted during the Tour. She helped us understand the Trains and Metro services, which would come in handed the week following our tour. She pointed out areas that we might like to see, that we didn't have time to see in our 8 hour tour. And, she was available, via email, to help out if we had question after our tour. And, we did use her assistance after our tour to find a couple of areas that she suggested. She was there for us even after the tour. What Service.I recommend asking for Yakko Hamabata if you need a Tour Guide who loves her City, Knows her City and loves helping others enjoy her City. THANKS YAKKO!!"

Our guide, Noriko, was very nice, informative, and patient. She explained a lot of things on Japanese culture, traditions, and the places that we visited. We were very lucky we could experience local food, like okonomiyaki (pancake) and moving sushi restaurant. Our daughters were very happy to learn some Japanese words. My husband was very satisfied that he could visit the hobby stores in Nakano and Akihabara. Thank you Travelience and Noriko, for giving us a great Tokyo's experience."

She explained many of the curiosities for sale in both the tourist market and outer fish market. She found us a restaurant which offered both Japanese and quasi European food . During lunch she looked up all the particular pieces of information we needed both for our visit to Tokyo and Kyoto. Thanks to her advice we managed to use the Tokyo and Kyoto public transport systems. On our last day we returned to Tokyo and did all my Christmas shopping in Shinjo temple market and got tickets for one act of Kabuki theatre on fourth floor of theatre. Her day of information and learning really enhanced our whole visit to Japan. Thank you so much"

From the start Emi was so attentive via email and set up a tour with our exact desired activities. Once we arrived to Japan, TWO typhoons hit the country back to back. We changed our travel numerous times and each time Emi was able to re-arrainge our tour to o there days. She was so accommodating and understanding. When the day of the tour arrived, we met our guide Yuriko and had an amazing day visiting all the sights on our list including a super fun calligraphy lesson and a sushi lunch at an automated restaurant that was incredible fun. I highly recommend this company to anyone who wants a seamless, personalized and inclusive private tour. You will not be let down."

Emi, as everyone has already said, was so very helpful. We booked a half day tour that took us to Tsukiji Fish Market, Tokyo Tower, Asakusa & Sensoji Temple. We really didn't know what we wanted, and Emi provided us with an itinierary that helped us dip our toes into Tokyo. We arranged to meet Noriko at our hotel. Noriko was wonderful and we learnt so much that first afternoon. We were able to explore the markets, and had a sushi lunch which was thoroughly enjoyable. As we only had the afternoon, Noriko was mindful of the queues, and was very accommodating with what we wanted to see at the markets. She also explained lots of things about Japanese culture, and we feel we were able to experience the rest of our trip with some understanding due to her informative guiding. We would thoroughly recommend Travelience and especially Noriko and would love to do another, more comprehensive tour, if ever we are in Tokyo again."

We visited out of the way restaurants known only to the locals which meant avoiding the hour long lines at the touristy places.

The itinerary, which was quite flexible, was tailored to meet our wishes - less shopping and maximum exposure to the Japanese culture. The result was an amazing 3 day jaunt through the vast majority of Tokyo's neighborhoods, utilizing the metro system to a great extent. Our tour guides, Noriko (1st day) and Haruhi, were simply outstanding - knowledgeable and engaging. Not only did we tour numerous gardens, temples and markets, we learned a great deal about Japan's history, experienced neighborhood celebrations and dined at local establishments. We would love to return to Tokyo and would highly recommend checking out Emi at Travelience when planning a trip."

Probably 1 of the best meals of entire trip and 60 dollars Canadian-unbelievable bargain. We then embarked on highlights of Tokyo tour using metro and walking.

I corresponded with Emi before we arrived and she was fantastic. We didn\u2019t request many specific sites (just a cat caf\u00e9 and the Tsukiji Fish Market). Originally Emi scheduled the rest of the day in and around the Asakusa area. But on the day of the tour we requested something outside of this area since this is where we were staying and could explore it on our own. Our guide was very accommodating and instead took us to see more of the pop culture of Tokyo (electronics district, including touring around an entire department store of odd entertainment (to a Westerner that is), etc.).Generally it was a pretty good day and we appreciated the flexibility. I do feel our guide fell short on providing background on the areas we visited and their cultural significance and it felt more like he was just shuttling us to different places, rather than provided any \u201cguidance\u201d on what we were seeing. He also did the not-so-soft ask for a tip which left a bad taste in my mouth. I know that tipping is not customary in Japan, but this guide had spent a few years in the US, so perhaps this is why he felt comfortable with it. Given how expensive a private tour is (and that you have to cover the guide\u2019s transportation costs, lunch and entrance fees) I was not happy about this. I also think (perhaps because we were somewhat close in age) that he was a little too casual about the whole day and the level of service provided. If in Tokyo again I will try a different tour provider."

I started emailing Emi about three months before departure as I was taking my parents and wanted to make sure the tours were all perfect and suitable. I don't have enough words to describe Emi's helpfulness, patience, promptness and flexibility. She went well beyond her call of duty to answer all my questions and make several changes before we even got to Japan. Then whilst in Japan, she continued providing information, helping to make last minute changes and marvellously dealing with any issues. Next come Yuka and Yuriko. We took the 8 hour Tokyo tour and 10 hours Nikko tour with Yuka and the 10 hour tour to Mt. Fuji with Yuriko. Both Yuka and Yuriko were incredible calm, patient, caring, attentive, knowledgeable, informative and fun to be with. The Tokyo tour with Yuka included Asakusa, Ueno, Sensoji temple, Nakamise, River cruise, Hamarikyu garden, Meiji Shrine. Incredible places and without Yuka we wouldn't have found it so easy to travel around and learn as much as we did. Best thing was that she took it really easy without hurrying us so we could take it all in. She was also very patient whilst trying to locate a vegetarian restaurant for lunch! Yuka clearly loves Nikko as this tour although at first it seemed far, was wonderful. Not sure why people would want to skip Nikko, but I highly recommend it especially if you have a great guide! We walked a lot and Yuka covered every part peacefully and we all enjoyed getting on the Shinkyo Bridge as well. Truly a memorable day. It was sad to say bye to Yuka who helped me with other logistics as well and made some extra recommendations for our free day in Tokyo which we did explore (Food Hall in Isetan was unbelievable)!Next day we were promptly picked up by Yuriko with whom we went to the 5th Station on Mt. Fuji. We changed plan the day before as we were originally due to go to Hakone. Yuriko looked up the best and quickest routes and quickly changed the entire plan for us. I am SO glad we did what we did. The bus journey there was lovely and quick and Yuriko tried hard to get us to see whatever we wanted to despite the fact that we had a tight schedule so we did enjoy views of Lake Kawaguchiko before heading to the 5th Station where were able to view Mt. Fuji which was extraordinary (first through the clouds and fog and then the entire Mount)! Thanks to Yuriko we also managed to have some lovely vegetarian curry and noodles for lunch! Once back in Tokyo and off the bus, Yuriko added a visit to the Metropolitan Government Building Observation Deck from where you get to see skyline views of Tokyo that you see on postcards and photos. This was a great bonus as we wanted to go here anyway.All that remains for me to say is a massive thank you to Emi, Yuka, Yuriko and Travelience without whom we would not have seen and experienced as much of Tokyo and surroundings as we did making it a memorable trip - THANK YOU for EVERYTHING! And for all those who read this review, best way to see Tokyo!"

We covered Asakusa, Akihabara, Shibuya, Meiji Shrine, and Takeshita Shopping street. He did really well in providing the history lessons we didn't read up on in advance as well as answering all our questions on everything from where to eat out to how to take the subway or JR Line to various places. He was very personable and outgoing. I really appreciated that he allowed us to adjust the schedule as we went along and spend more time shopping. Thanks for taking us to the multi-level shopping mall in Akihabara...I love my fancy pens and Pocky! I think the highlight for all of us was a hidden gem for lunch. Tucked into a neighborhood, Makoto took us to an authentic Ramen noodle restaurant. There was a line out the door and no tourists. It was a great experience to sit at a counter with a bunch of locals eating some amazing ramen and watching the cooks make everything to order.We were short on a time in this trip so I'm glad we booked the tour. If you don't have time to plan or spend learning how to get around, this is a great option! We saw a lot and really enjoyed our time with Makoto."

For our first trip to Japan (outside of Narita airport anyway), we booked a private tour for my family (me, husband, 5-year old, 2-year old, and my parents) for our first full day in Tokyo. We thought that this would be a good way for us to get to know a bit about the city and how it works before we explored on our own for the remainder of our trip...and we were not wrong! This tour was invaluable! From the very beginning, Emi was wonderful in arranging a custom tour for us; together we came up with a plan that could work with the kids' energy levels and typical meal schedules, and she was so patient in answering all my questions. Payment was super-easy via paypal. And our guide Yuka was amazing! She met us at our hotel and we spent a full day (8 hours) moving around the eastern part of the city, with her showing us how to navigate the subways and trains and giving tips for moving about the city, while giving us great details and insights into the past and present of Tokyo/Edo. She was so patient with the kids (and my parents!) and by the end of the day she felt like an old friend. We had such a fantastic time, and are convinced we would not have enjoyed Tokyo half so much if we hadn't done this tour our first day. Thanks to Yuka, we felt confident enough to explore the western part of the city as well as Odaiba in our remaining 3 days, even with 2 strollers and my not-so-young-anymore parents. Many, many thanks to Yuka and Emi for an excellent introduction to Tokyo -- we love the city, and will be back for sure (though, maybe we'll let the kids grow up a bit so they can walk for more than 10 minutes without getting tired!) :)"

She was always pleasant and helpful even I kept changing my mind regarding where we want to visit multiple times. I traveled with my son (17) and my daughter (12). Yuka was our guide for both days - one day in Tokyo and one day in Nikko.We all feel so blessed having Yuka to be our guide. She is very knowledgeable, courteous, and friendly. She not only teaches us about Japanese people and culture but also helps us to fulfill our individual wishes during the trip. Following here I will mention the highlights of our trip \u2013 don\u2019t go into details.Day 1 \u2013 Asakusa sightseeing, Akihabara sightseeing, Shibuya sightseeing and lunch, Ghibli museum.  \u2022 Asakusa \u2013 Senso-ji temple: We had fortune reading and learned how to \u201ccleanse\u201d ourselves (clean hands and mouth with water) before getting into the temple to pray. We also tried fresh made bun cakes with red beans on the shopping street in front of the temple.\u2022 Akihabara \u2013 My son\u2019s most favorite area. While waiting for my son went shopping, my daughter, Yuka, and I went to a coffee shop nearby to have a drink. I had iced green tea with honey jelly which was very good.\u2022 Shibuya \u2013 Yuka helps to take my son\u2019s pictures while he was standing in the middle of the Shibuya crossing \u2013 that is one of his wishes to be there. After that, we went to a sushi restaurant where the order and delivery system are all automated. It is such a fun experience! In addition, the sushi was fresh, delicious, and cheap too :)\u2022 We had a bit of free time so that we went into an arcade nearby to have our daughter-mom photos and then had fun decorating them. And we went to a food fair by Shibuya train station, I had never seen so many well-prepared, well-decorated, colorful and delicious-looking food gathering in one place like this. (We love good food!). \u2022 Ghibli museum \u2013 because we are Ghibli studio fans. I reversed the tickets around 3 months in advance before we left to Japan. This is a small museum but it is worth seeing if you are Ghibli studio fan. We got some souvenirs from the gift shop but they are not cheap. Day 2 \u2013 Nikko \u2013 Shinkyo bridge and ToshoguWe had to wake up early on that day to catch an early 7am train from Tokyo to Nikko. We picked up breakfast at convenient stores in our hotel and also at the train station. That was a 2-hour train ride which we could see different sceneries - rural/forest areas. Toshogu shrine area is surrounded by green tall trees, waterfalls, and green moss with a spiritual atmosphere. The architecture is amazing. We also bought several different kinds of charm and souvenirs. For lunch, we had \u201ctofu skin\u201d lunch which is the area specialty. Then Yuka took us to a dragon painting gallery. Both of my children were able to customize their own paintings and the artist painted right in front of us. We went back to the hotel hot and sweaty after a long day walking in the hot and humid summer weather. However, we really appreciate Yuka being with us. We all love having her and miss her as a partner/friend in our trip. If we happen to be in Tokyo again, we will definitely ask for Yuka. Thanks so much making our trip wonderful and memorable :)"

            "review": "A Tale of 2 Different Experiences. We booked this company only about a week before our trip, and Emi was very helpful with arranging it! We had 2 tours. One with Yuka and one with Michiyo. Yuka was 5 stars out of 5!Michiyo was 2 stars out of 5.Emi's planning was a 3.5 stars out of 5.I will preface my review that we were traveling with our 2 children ages 8 and 10, and my wife was finishing recovering from a sprained ankle. Emi knew this ahead of time, and we asked her to plan accordingly. We also had certain dietary constraints, but were able to eat at most restaurants as we could eat many types of fish, plain noodles, and a host of other items. I have been to Tokyo many times before, and the reason I hired a tour guide was to help us with direction, provide insight into the culture and lifestyle, and explain the significance of the different sights particularly to my children. Yuka was extraordinary! Michiyo was less than satisfactory...I have been on dozens of tours (both public and private) across the globe, and have almost always had fantastic experiences. Our experience may not be indicative of the experience others have, but I will share my experience.Yuka was wonderful! She ensured that the pace of the tour was appropriate for everybody. No one felt rushed, and although we skipped some of the items on the tour, she made sure that it was truly enjoyable for all of us. She shared with us stories of growing up in Japan, and discussed some of the unique political and cultural aspects of the country. She is a consummate professional with a passion for her country, a wonderful personality, and the flexibility to make changes as needed to ensure that everyone has a wonderful experience! My children can't say enough about their experience with her!Michiyo was clearly hoping to be somewhere else (not with my family), and by 3:45 PM or so, I told her she could just go home. We didn't learn very much about Japan (usually tour guides like to fill the empty time with stories and history). We felt very rushed, and my wife was unable to take all the pictures she wanted. Then we were taken to a hole in the wall vegan restaurant that looked like it was straight out of the 1970's. The walk to get to this \"paradise\" restaurant was very long up many hills (my wife had a fractured leg and we had 2 kids- both of which you knew ahead of time), with Michiya always being way ahead of us and we felt like a huge burden to her, and when we arrived there was no air conditioning, and the food choices were not kid friendly at all. Michiyo got lost, and didn't have any information about this restaurant so we could make an informed decision about whether it was the right choice for our family. She just said this is where we're going. Finally, we left and took 2 taxis to Shibuya to a normal restaurant where we had lunch. She dropped us off at the Sky Tree after recommending that we skip the Imperial Palace (we didn't want to slow her down or inconvenience her so we skipped it), and she told us where to wait and to take a taxi back to the hotel. She very graciously agreed to write down the name of our hotel in Japanese, although didn't include the address for the taxi driver which made things a bit confusing. We saw many people skipping the line at the SkyTree but that was never an option for us as we didn't get web tickets, which could have been arranged ahead of time (it was a busy Sunday evening with over an hour of waiting). The weather with Michiyo was perfect, yet she managed to make it an unpleasant tour.With Yuka it was rainy and overcast, yet she managed to provide us with a true first class experience, tailoring the trip to exactly what my kids needed, walking with us NOT ahead of us like Michiyo, relating to my children, and telling us stories and bits and pieces of the culture. As the success of a tour is so dependent on a good tour guide, I highly recommend the Gray Line group tour which is cheaper, and we also took (a different tour), which has fantastic guides."

Emi helped me arrange the details of our 2-day tour and she coordinated with our tour guide, Makado. We had a marvelous experience from the initial booking with Emi, to meeting Makado, our guide at the hotel and the 2 days we spent with him. He was fun, funny, interesting, flexible, willing to adjust the schedule to accommodate our interests and needs. He suggested altering one item on the itinerary when we realized it would be raining for part of the day. His suggestion turned out to be just what our family enjoyed. He is great working with families and kids and I could see how pleased he was when we were obviously having a fun time. I would highly recommend using Travelience and Emi to help book your trip, she answered all my questions and even suggested some travel items like how we could best get from the airport to our hotel and where to exchange currency. Little things like that made us feel comfortable as we started the trip and relaxed during the entire tour. Thank you!"

Emi was a great help when you tried to make plans for your day trips. She's lovable as i changed itinerary a lot in our scheduled plan, she always making fast replies to your emails and patient in answering all things that i need to know such as weather or even clothes you need to bring! Just ask her anything, she'll be gladly to answer and i made changes in last minutes like a drop-off by our hotel and it was manageable! Luv ya Emi, thank you so much for your kind understanding!!!! I have this customized tour as i went to Tokyo with my son (11 y/o) and we met Yuka san as our tour guide. She's great to be with!!! we went to Ueno park, visited asakusa temple where i got this my lucky good fortune and even have plenty of time to visit Miraikan science center and Odaiba to take a pic with Gundam robot with the monorail. Travel with Yuka became a shopping tour as i had long list of souvenir to buy, and Yuka was very helpful to try to help me to find out where we could buy all those things. She's great, i felt like i met an old friend of mine and we had so much fun together!!!!! Using trains and subways was so much fun and turned out we didnt need to worry as they had many signs or announcement made in english, just try to remember where you should get off! Then we went to Meiji jingu, takeshita dori, shibuya crossing, imperial palace, akb48 cafe, and we too had our luck to go up to Tokyo Skytree Tower without so much fuss and long waiting line! Yuka was our lucky charm ^_^ i definetely will book again with them when i travel to Tokyo again! Can't wait!!!! Thank you so much guys for your great effort!"

I booked a private tour at Travelience. Emi was very helpful in setting up my itineraries and keeping me updated of any changes.

Even though the rainy season started and the weather was bad for a couple of days, I really enjoyed my trip and they helped me make the most out of these 5 days. As a side note: I am gluten intolerant, which is not obvious in Japan, but they made every effort to make it possible for me to taste some delicious local dishes. I would definitely recommend this company!"

The major help was that Mikiko picked us up at our hotel and took us to the train station, where we booked all our train journeys for the week on our Japan Rail Pass. That was worth the tour price alone. We also saw the outer fish market on a special holiday where they had 1/2 price sushi. We went to where the locals went and got great sushi for good value, and saw the show of the sushi chefs preparing and greeting visitors. In addition, we went to a park and had a tea ceremony with machi tea and sweets and saw the Imperial Gardens, and some other sights. We appreciated not getting lost, as happened to us on our arrival and when we got back near our hotel without our wonderful guide."

He gave us a lot of insight into the temples we were to see and some of the underlying history and cultural background. He helped us get acquainted with using the subway and also made short work of purchasing our train tickets from Tokyo to Kyoto; we could have done this, but it was much quicker and easier with his help and good to get the task out of the way. It was fun walking around the Asakusa area and having him identify all of the treats we might want to try. He also made some recommendations of other things we might want to do during our trip. Makoto has a college degree from a U.S. university and spoke excellent English. Before the trip, Emi was very responsive and accommodating with customizing our itinerary.

We submitted a request online, and Emi replied right away. Our first tour was with Yuka and she took us to Hakone including the Open Air Museum, the cable car to Owakudani (where we ate black hard boiled eggs cooked in the hot springs), and a had a pirate boat ride. She was super friendly, and helpful and even helped us buy the train tickets to Kyoto that we needed for the end of the week, in addition to organizing an amazing day at Hokene for us. She was terrific with the kids, and had everything perfectly timed to catch the next mode of transportation.Next, Kaz brought us to ninja training on the second day. She was very knowledgable and told us about the ninja family that did the training. The ninja training was truly amazing, and fun; the sensei was very patient with the kids and was able to teach at a level that worked for both the kids and the adult in our group who did the training. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity for children and adults, and included real weapons (but definitely safe; you train with rubber ones first)--we really felt like this was an authentic experience, not an activity for generic tourists. It was the favorite thing our kids did especially since they study karate, and definitely was not \"commercial\" in any way. We can't recommend it enough!Lastly, on the third day Miki took us around Tokyo, including Asakusa for a boat ride to Hamarikyu (where we had tea in a beautiful tea house), a visit to Tsukiji (with pottery shopping and a fabulous sushi lunch), and shopping for a spy camera in Akihabara. It was action-packed, but still worked great with the kids (who didn't mind walking).We highly recommend all three tour guides and this company! This was a truly amazing experience in every respect!"

My husband and I \u00a0did two tours with her\u00a0- a tour of Tokyo highlights and the next day, a trip to Hakone.\u00a0Pro-\u00a01. TRANSIT: Tokyo is not the easiest system to navigate. We have been all over Europe and just came from China, and from our experience, Tokyo had the least chance of running into someone that spoke English, even in touristy areas and restaurants. Masako helped us navigate the subway system, ask about tickets, helped arrange transit, all of which would be extremely difficult without her. \u00a0Once you learn the system, you will realize that Tokyo is very efficient and its transit system is far more advanced and easy to use than NYC where we live, but it does require a few days to get used to, which I am guessing most people do not have.\u00a02. Cultural and historical information - Masako taught us so much about the history and background of many of the places we visited, and offered much insight into the day to day lives of the people that live here. \u00a03. \u00a0Customized to what you want to see. The benefits of going with a private tour guide vs tour group is being able to see what you want to see. If something piques your interest, they can add it to the trip.\u00a04. Also masako herself was extremely sweet. She even brought coffee and cakes in case we were hungry.\u00a0Cons:Not really much, except that it is expensive. We paid about 300 usd for the Tokyo trip and 500 for Hakone. This does not pay for metro and train tickets, entrance fees, or food (needless to say)Overall great experience, if you don't mind the expense. But then again, what isn't expensive in Tokyo!"

I already gave up thinking the tour already left without me, but somehow I saw a group of people waiting and figured that they could be on the tour. And lo and behold they were. I guess the schedule changed because they put me down for just Asakusa tour. I was thankful they waited for me because I thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Those hot and fresh off the machine mini anpans (bun filled with red beans) were delicious. Since I enjoyed the morning tour so much, I decided to stay for the afternoon tour of Trends of Tokyo. I was looking forward to Heart of Tokyo tour because I wanted to go to Tsukiji fish market. But, they only do one of the afternoon tours per day, so I decided to go along with it. And I'm glad I did. They took us to Genki, an unusual sushi restaurant where you order from a screen and they shuttle the food to you on a conveyer belt. Almost like a futuristic restaurant. I had lots of fun ordering sushi, even though I don't really like it. I wouldn't have found this place or known how to order if I was on my own. Michiya was very warm and friendly and knows her city very well. She was very helpful in telling me which restaurant has good, reasonable priced sushi at Tsukiji market and recommended some dishes. The drawback to this tour was that we spent too much time for lunch, so it shortened the time for the remainder of the tour. We only spent less then five minutes on Takeshita Street which had some interesting shops because of the lack of time. But I went back to Takeshita street on my own anyways. Overall, I would recommend this tour because they do take you to the must see sites. I just wish the Michiyo wouldn't have rushed the last half of the tour and maybe extended it 15-30 minutes more."

Before the tour, I emailed them some questions about good places to eat in Tokyo, and Naoaki quickly responded with many great and thoughtful suggestions.When we arrived at the meeting place, we met Naoaki and our tour guide Masako. They were both very friendly and had a great positive attitude and energy.We can't say enough nice things about Masako! She was such a great tour guide! She is very passionate about her job and obviously loves what she does, which made it so much fun to explore Tokyo with her. She was also very knowledgeable about Japanese history and culture, and had so many great suggestions for places to visit in Tokyo. She made us wish our trip was a month instead of only 10 days, because she had so many great suggestions we won't be able to do them all (but we will do as many as we can!).From the moment you meet her, it is very clear that Masako cares a lot about her customers and wants them to have a great, positive experience of Tokyo. She even spent a lot of extra time with us, which was so thoughtful. Our tour was only scheduled until 4:00, but she kept showing us around until a little after 5. Thank you so much Masako!We hope we will be back to Japan soon, and when we do we're really looking forward to another tour with you!-Zach and Daphne"

Michiyo was a very helpful and knowledgeable guide who gave us a valuable tour of the City and a proper local experience (taking us to the fish market, explaining local religious customs, etc.). She even went so far as to help me book my trip to Mount Fuji, including some reasonably complex logistics (all after our tour had finished). Highly recommend the tour as a good primer to the City. Travelience is a relatively new player in the business, and they definitely have an eagerness to please, which makes for a pleasant tour. Michiyo has been a tour guide for well over a year, and clearly knew her stuff."

I had talked to Naoaki before the tour started and told him that I had already been on an Asakusa tour so he shifted the schedule and replaced it with a tour through Koppabashi dori. Awesome! We checked out quite a lot of stuff there and then made our way to Ryugoku (the sumo area). We ate at a sumo restaurant which was truly fantastic! Next we headed to the Edo-Tokyo museum and Michiyo provided us with all sorts of cool facts. Then we went to the Sumo museum and check out some Sumo history!Next stop was Akihabara. Michiyo took us to some very interesting stores and showed us some secret passageways throughout the ward. She finally dropped us off at Kobayashi Camera (a super electronic department store) and we said our good byes.This tour was truly fantastic and I highly recommend you to use Travelience!And to top if all off, Naoaki even suggested some extra things to check out when we had time such as the Robot Restaurant and the Ninja Asakasa Restaurant. He even went out of his way to set up a reservation for us. Truly great service! I know that the next time I am in Japan, I will definitely use their tours again!"

They have very good knowledge about the place we visited as well as they explained me everything in details.Everything was fine and I really appreciate drinking cold green tea in a traditional tea house overlooking a lake in Tokyo. I went to Asakusa, Ueno, Yanaka, Kappabashi, Ryogoku, Edo and Akihabara, they are very nice places to go.I have been travelling a lot and I always use local guides as it is the best way to understand the local culture.I am sure I will be back to Japan."

They were very courteous and excited to host the tour for me.Went to the various attractions. Michiyo helped me with the train rides and tickets, and was giving very good advise along the way.It was a really hot day in Tokyo. It was the first day of the heat spell. The thing that amazed me most is how kind and helpful the guides were. I was sweating, and Michiyo offered an extra face towel and a Japanese hand-fan for me. That was really thoughtful and kind of her.At the end of the tour, was even introduced to Naoaki, the CEO of Travelience, and Naoaki brought me to a nice pub for a cooling drink after a hot day, and we discussed on the tour experience and asked me how they can improve further.To me, everything was already perfect. Its really value for money. Will definitely return to Tokyo for another tour with them.Well done Travelience!"

I could enjoy the Asakusa Walking Tour lead by Yuriko-san, her interesting explanations and demonstrations too. I learned about Japanese beliefs and religions, about traditional souvenirs and snacks as well, and could appreciate this wonderful district which is Asakusa. Even under the rain, the temple and the shrine were still wonderful, and because I've been taught their history, it gave another dimension to my visit so that I could enjoy it even more.

The tours are really good; we discovered places that normally in the \u201ccommon tours\u201d are not listed. My wife and me spent two days with tours and were really nice. The personal attention is excellent. The size of the groups are also good, because I believe that smaller groups can be more flexible in order to change some listed places to see or to spend more time in some others.Also we received advice of things to do in Tokyo, where to buy, what to do at night. To resume, is like if you were talking with a friend in Tokyo and he helped in everything you need."

The guides were very friendly and knowledgeable, and were willing to answer even the smallest of questions. They wanted you to get right in the action and to really enjoy yourself while you were there. Because of this great atmosphere, when they invited us on the 'Foodie' tour right after, we said yes without any hesitation. It was another good choice - the money you pay for the tour goes right to the food they buy, and they ended up taking us down to a beautiful spot under the cherry blossoms over looking the river. There were some good laughs, too - the best part of the tours was being able to just chat with someone who actually lives in Japan; you can get a different perspective of life in the area that way. Above all, I would recommend these tours to anyone. They were the highlight of my trip to Tokyo."

He was very personable as he shared information about himself, his company, and the value of a Rickshaw tour. I decided to take the 30 minute tour and was very impressed with the entire experience. I recommend the tour and Naoki, highly!"

It was a perfect way to see the area and learn a little history in 30 minutes. Our guide Tomo was so personable and interesting, and his English was very good. He was very kind to put the cover up on the rickshaw when it started sprinkling. We will definitely remember this as a positive and unique experience. Highly recommend if you are visiting Asakusa!"

He explained all about ebisuya and the service they provide also showing us the different routes which were catered to our viewing needs. We were going to go down toTemple so we chose the tour which went through all the traditional spots. Our driver was named ocean (jaikai sato) he spoke amazing English and he also wanted to visit the UK he was a big fan of the Beatles. While on the tour around asakusa ocean showed us some amazing spots and was very knowledgeable of the place we visited. He was a very socialable guy we talked about anime and japanese music he liked baby metal which was awesome ;) at end of tour my leg was a bit numb as I stepped off the carriage ocean was quick to grab me and he apologised even though it wasn't his fault. He gave us some free postcards which I've already used and a free sticker which I've put in my scrapbook, he also showed us the way to the temple which was a min away from where he dropped us off. Would definitely recommend this for people visiting asakusa, not all of the men working speak English but some do so don't let that put you off this experience. Thank you ocean :D"

My husband and I been to many other rickshaw in different country. I gotta say, this is the most fun, worry-free, well worth the price rickshaw. These guys love their job and treat every little details in the tour to the finest; from get us to be the most comfortable as we can; take the awesome picture for us; make sure we are not too hot/cold. entertain us and our little girl; explain all the things that are around the area that they take us through. Sato's English was very good and that also help explain to us in many aspect of Asakusa. The most unique and awesome part in my opinion is at the end. They wrote us receipt that come with small postcard gifts, cute little rickshaw guy drawing seasonal sticker (for collection 4seasons for price). I gotta say this is the most memorable rickshaw experience my family ever have. Definitely will get on the ride again when we visit japan next time !"

Diasuke was knowledgeable and made the trip fun. It was especially cool that we happened by the Geisha school in time for one of the people there to exit the building and offer to take our pictures. Diasuke also asked us what we wanted to see or know, and recommended restaurants and activities for later. I would recommend this to anyone who would like something different.Just a heads up for travelers. The rickshaws can be a little narrow, so be sure you don't mind being close to your fellow traveler. If you like your space, you may want to book your own vehicle. They can accommodate several people traveling together. Also, if you know in advance you want to do this, booking ahead can save you money (I booked through Viatour)."

Me and my mum wore our yukata and strolled around Asakusa. The sights were pretty but I've seen them before. I didn't expect much of the day after, 'til our friend booked us a rickshaw ride. It was a first for me, and it actually made a really strong impression--strong enough to make it one of the best experiences I've had so far on my 3 months stay here in Japan.  Our rickshaw boy was named Shun, a very charming lad. At first I was reluctant about the whole thing, as I'm sure most see it as somehow a little degrading for the rickshaw pullers. But then, I gave it a shot to try to see a different perspective of it. Shun was very polite, as with most Japanese people, and he was quite genuine about his job, as well. He started off, pulling us in tow and gave detailed backgrounds of what we are seeing on the ride, usually adding his own quips, to his usual script I assume. He noticed my mum getting a little drowsy (due to being tired and sleepless btw), and so he made extra effort on keeping us engaged throughout the ride. Needless to say, it made the whole thing more interesting and fun, with us taking pictures at special stops. Time flew by and I understood how rich and unique the experience was, with Shun showing great enthusiasm and minimal to no fatigue. By the time it was over, we were endowed with a simply unforgettable experience. Thanks for the very cool experience. Props to our energetic rickshaw boy, Shun! Here's to hoping for another great ride soon. :) --hiro"

As we came out of the Metro, following the very clear and precise details are provided to us by the tour operators, we were greeted by the smiling faces of the Rickshaw runners, and a lovely sign with our names on it. We immediately felt very safe and comfortable in the rickshaw, and our runner, Daisuke, took off down the road! His English was very good, he was cheerful, friendly, and gave us very interesting explanations of the areas in the Asakusa district that we passed through. We stopped at a couple of locations, and he obligingly took photos of us in the rickshaw together. One highlight that we particularly enjoyed was stopping at a beautiful Buddhist temple, Matsuchiyama Temple, that was calm and serene, and not thronged with crowds, as the largest temple in Asakusa is. We felt very reverent and appreciated having the customs and history explained to us. We had some lively stretches through the Geisha town area, and the comedy theatre area as well. We finished up at the main Sensoji temple. The last memory was of the wonderful smiling face of Daisuke, waving enthusiastically as we disappeared down the street. We would recommend it to anybody wanting to enjoy exploring Tokyo with an enthusiastic (and very fit!) guide. Thanks so much."

Ocean provided a historical documentary during the entire tour...and an indebt history of the many shrines, temples and markets along the route. He also provided a photo shoot in front of the multiple landmarks during the stops along the route. At the end of the tour, we received free packages of post cards, tour stickers and discount coupon tickets for our next tour or to share with friends that plan to see Tokyo via Rickshaw. I will definitely take another tour and I plan to collect all four of the Japanese season stickers and collect my special Ebisuya gift. If opportunity permits while in Tokyo, I highly recommend you see the city via Asakusa Rickshaw Tour Ebisuya...and if English is your first language, ask for Taikai \"Ocean\" Sato!!"

He explained the options/courses available very well, and after being informed we were on our way.He was very informative and a fun person to talk to and listen as he pointed out many of the historical aspects of Asakusa, and on the ride he took us to the Geisha town, which was our first time there. The ride was pleasant, the weather was very warm but with a cool breeze on a rickshaw it was a very pleasant experience, especially while wearing kimonos!And as it turned out we had a 10% discount on our rickshaw ride, for renting kimonos (my friend acquired a coupon from the rental shop, Kyoto Kimono Wargo).Highly recommend this, especially in conjunction with a kimono rental!"

Tetsu already made my kids impressed. I loved the part that they kept calling him \"superman\" \"super hero\". My wife and I felt that we were very lucky to have Tetsu as our first ever rickshaw ride guide. He was very knowledgable to describe all the sights and was able to communicate back and forth with us. Be honest, I was worried that we couldn't communicate to each other before taking the ride. Anyway, long story short. We extended our trip for another 30 minutes to explore more in the neighbourhood. It was a very great way to see everything and know the culture in such short time."

The rickshaw ride itself was great, smooth and at a good pace. We stopped every once in a while for him to explain the history (in really good English!) behind the more famous spots as well as take several pictures.

Our group met Kazuki at the curb outside the Asakusa Kannon Temple on an early April afternoon after a day in Akihabara. Being a group of 6 ranging from young adults, baby boomers to grandma, we had a wide range of expectations to satisfy. Since one of us had ever been on a rickshaw ride, we decided to go for it. Kazuki quickly rounded 2 of his English-speaking drivers Yoppy and Kouhei to, not simply 'drive' but truly provide us with a memorable experience!It was a chilly afternoon and they all placed seat warmers under us and gently tucked us in with warm blankets over our laps. Also, they put our minds to rest by securing all of our shopping bags to the rickshaws. With all this being taken care of, our minds were placed at ease and we were ready to get started. With 2 of us on each rickshaw, it was a wonderful personalized way to experience the Cherry Blossoms in bloom at Sumida Park. Kouhei, our driver, was extremely knowledgeable, polite and gracious. In excellent English, he explained the history and details of the area that we would have never thought to ask about. We felt that we were walking through Asakusa history. Even grandma said that she learn so much and had so much fun. We also were so grateful that they kindly took the time to take so many pictures with our iPhones with us in the rickshaws at a number of intruiging spots throughout out experience. Never thought that I would find myself in front of a geisha house! After the ride was over, we could not stop talking about how happy we were about our decision to take a ride with Kouhei, Kazuki and Yoppy.We have stayed at 5-diamond hotels but have never felt the sincere desire to provide a heartfelt quality experience. Kouhei, Kazuki and Yoppy exceeded all expectations! Their service delivered with a sincere love of people and what they do, they are true ambassadors for Japan. Our family spent almost 2 weeks traveling all over Japan and received great service throughout the trip. But as we reminisce, the rickshaw ride in Asakausa rises to the top! Thank you Kouhei, Kazuki and Yoppy for warm memorable experience on a chilly day!"

These rickshaw guys at Ebisuya are probably the best in Asakusa from what I heard. They have strict tests on safety, manners, knowledge for every trainee before they take up customers to guarantee THE BEST for travelers. And I also loved the part to hear they clean up the streets of Asakusa every morning before starting tours. The Asakusa local's must love these guys at Ebisuya.My tour guide was Shin, a fluent English speaker with a natural talent for charm. He can give a tour in rich detail, so those of you who want to know the historic background of Asakusa in English, I'd recommend him.While riding a rickshaw, you're going to feel like one of those royal members who wave out to the people outside the carriage. Other tourists are going to give you an envious look and turn camera lenses to get a shot of an actual moving rickshaw- with you on it! Enjoy and wave to them like every royalty does!!"

We went for an hour and a half costing 25000 Yen but man you have to experience this once in your life. Arigato \u2764Yoppy\u2764"

He took us some great photos that can hardly be taken by ourselves. The ride was very pleasant and a rather unique way to explore around Asakusa. Even better if you come during Sakura season.

As we crossed the road, a friendly guide waved us over and explained how we could hire a rickshaw tour around the area. It seemed really reasonable and since it was difficult to walk in tabi and geta, we thought it might be fun. The local shops didn't open until 10am, so we had an hour tour.Our driver was Daisuke who spoke very good English and was strong and fast. He stopped at picturesque locations to take photos of us and even showed us the correct shrine etiquette. It was a great experience and Daisuke was really friendly which made it even better. He answered any questions we had and even recommended a sushi place for us to visit after. Daisuke said that there is also a branch in Kyoto, so we plan to do the rickshaw tour there as well."

My apologies to the three young gentlemen who pulled our rickshaws for misplacing the card that had their names, or I would have mentioned them here. when we started off, they made sure we were snugly covered with a blanket and there were heat packs to keep our seats warm too. Along the way, they will stop, point out and explain things of interest to us. We all felt it beats walking aimlessly around the old town, unable to read Japanese and not being able to understand unique things about old Japan. It was money well spent for us, but hard earned for our rickshaw pullers. I would definitely recommend this tour to friends."

Then I saw a human powered rickshaw that I rode before. I wanted to ride it again. Then a man that tells people about the rickshaw talked to us and we decided to ride it. I was so happy.The person that was pulling the rickshaw was Matsumoto Reo-kin. He was handsome and was a great person. When we went to places he would explain to us with a great smile on his face. Sometimes we would ask us if we were cold or not. Even when we went to the jinja he would explain to us. He was so polite. Thanks for the fun and amazing ride!"

We were greeted with a welcome sign, as we stepped off a riverboat at the market meeting place. Then the company manager, Yasusei Fujiwara, and our \"driver\", Masaki Honjo introduced themselves. My wife had arranged all of this by email in advance of our travels... their responses were complete and very helpful. It was quickly evident, as we started our ride with Masaki that we were in for a treat. He is a very athletic young man who is completing college (financed by his earnings) with a thesis on bringing the rickshaw business into modern relevance. His English was super - as was his sense of humor, knowledge of Tokyo and its history, and his ability to explain temples, shrines, geishas, and current events to us in a riveting manor. We covered quite a large area in the two hours and never once felt concerned about sometimes being in major traffic with Masaki - he is a great and careful \"driver\" (runner). This experience early in our nineteen day trip gave us a wealth of background knowledge which made the rest of our travels that much more interesting and meaningful. For example, he explained and clarified the differences in shrines and temples as well as rituals the faithful perform in their visits to these fantastic places. This really is a \"must do\" experience for young and old alike... worth every yen!"

Having said that, it's a labyrinth. There is much to see, so you need someone who knows the area well to show you around. What better way to travel than in a traditional rickshaw, where your rickshaw puller is your guide! This immerses you right into antiquity.The moment I, my husband and children exited Asakusa Metro Station, we were greeted by Ryo, an affable Ebisuya rickshaw puller/guide, who explained in detail where he could take us and gave us options of timings and rates offered. We opted for the 1 1/2 hour trip so we could have good views of the Sky Tree, see the Asahi Beer Sculpture, experience the Samurai & Geisha Districts and visit 3 Major Shrines, including the Maneki Neko & Sensoji Temples, with a drop off at the traditional Nakamise shopping street.Ryo was joined by Tatsuki and off we went, in 2 rickshaws. Tatsuki was so much fun, regaling the kids with his antics, jokes and experimental photo taking. Ryo, who has studied in Canada, had an in depth knowledge of every place and area we visited.At the end of our tour we were reluctant to get off the rickshaws as the tour was more than what we had bargained for. An immersive, unforgettable, experience.Even though we have experienced this, we are definitely planning on doing another tour with Ebisuya Rickshaws on our next visit to Tokyo, specifically with Ryo and Tatsuki and for the longest possible time!- Felicia Variava Albert, Managing Director"

We talked to one of the advertisers standing in the street and agreed to take the shortest route (for 4000 yen), because we we had limited time. We met with a wonderful guide, Ryoma. He spoke very good english and talked to us during most of the trip, but gave us time to simply watch as well. He stopped some places where he knew we would get a nice view and told us the history of several of the places we stopped. He made jokes and answered our questions with ease, and he was generally really pleasant as a guide.Would reccommend this to everyone who wants a unique experience as well as a nice view of Asakusa, with some info about the main attractions :)"

Before crossing over to the main gate one of the many rickshaw drivers(Ocean) in the area approached me about taking possible tour. I usually don't go for solicitations plus we are both bigger in size so I wasn't sure about the seating. But he had a good \"sell\" and assured our size/weight wouldn't be any issue. We could have \"probably\" squeezed into one rickshaw but Ocean offered a second for same price. Our Second driver (Yuma) came and away we went. It was really cool once we got going and I instantly knew it was good decision. We did short tour that was about 15mins but it was amazing and filled with information about the area and temple that we wouldn't have know by wondering around. We also got some terrific photos on our phones thanks to our drivers. I would highly recommend doing this tour and a Rickshaw ride in Japan will be one thing you can scratch off your bucket list."

Well, this turned out to be one of the best last minute decisions ever. It was funny that the rickshaw guy we spoke to while we were trying to find the pick up point turned out to be one of Ebisuya's people, and he held up the huge welcome sign with my name on it. Very corny, but also very cute and funny.Our driver, Masaki, was excellent!! So friendly and knowledgeable, and always smiling. He kept us well entertained throughout the ride. He showed us places that we would not have seen if we had just wandered around Asakusa on our own. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our ride. Thank you, Masa, for a wonderful ride."

There are many ways to see Asakusa area in Tokyo, but definitely taking a rickshaw ride is the best in my opinion. The sights that your driver will show you, the things that he will tell you about the area exceed any travel book, but instead stream from the native wisdom. (Here I want to thank to my driver, Reo, because his smile made my day beautiful.)As most of the people taking the ride are Japanese, this is certainly not just a touristic experience. Also, I recommend renting or purchasing a yukata from a nearby show and wearing it on the ride, thus making unforgettable memories as you have traveled back in time. Note! The driver will take the most amazing pictures of you on the rickshaw so definitely bring a camera with you."

We had just gotten there and walked up the station steps when we were greeted by rickshaw drivers. They were so friendly, spoke great English (bonus for us), and gave us tour options. We had a driver called Aki (excuse my spelling if it's wrong) he was such a beautiful soul! He was funny, had great knowledge of the area and history, offered to take photos for us at various locations and you could tell he was so genuine and happy to be helping us explore. We had great conversations with him and I thought it was beautiful how much he enjoyed his job! Although there are many different rickshaw companies, every driver we passed was so friendly, it was such a great atmosphere! Deciding to do a rickshaw tour was definitely our favourite experience of the trip, Aki made our trip all the more wonderful and memorable and we hope to see him again next time for a new adventure! It was an unexpected little treasure and were leaving a piece of our heart in Asakusa x"

We went up to one and told them our names, and immediately they recognized us and pointed us in the right direction. We then found one of the coordinators who welcomed us with our names on poster board. We had a wonderful time with Mr. Masa as our guide in Asakusa, Tokyo. He spoke great English and had a wonderful personality. Very cheerful, positive, and wonderful energy. He says he loves his job and envisions he will do this for some time to come, which shows in his positive attitude, which I think matters a lot for these types of experiences. You want a guide who is happy doing what they are doing, and he is definitely that kind of guide. He shared with us his knowledge about the history and facts of all the different sites we saw. He stopped to take a lot of photos for us.We were able to visit a number of interesting sights during our two hour tour, including Asahi Beer Hall, a temple, geisha house, stopped for a famous local snack, saw a local bath house, traditional Tokyo comedy theater, Sky Tree, and back to the main temple where the tour started. Since our whole trip to Tokyo was very short, we wanted to cover as much ground as possible. It is very difficult to take in all of Japan in one weekend, you definitely need a week to properly give it justice, however, when time is tight, this gets the job done in a great way. You only have time to visit one temple to walk around, but the purpose of this is to see the area by rickshaw and revisit all those areas on your own. Or if you want to do a full day, Mr. Masa said he is happy to do that as well.I also enjoy the fact that this is a highly sustainable business, low carbon footprint and also feels great supporting local business. Would definitely recommend this to people visiting Tokyo for the first time.Thank you again for a great time, Mr. Masa. You were and are tremendous and appreciate your kind hospitality for our trip."

After our ride time we ended at Senso-Ji, the most popular attraction of Asakusa. During the ride, Masaya stopped at several places and took the photos for us. He is very careful driving us around to ensure the ride is safe and smooth.

Requested for English speaking guides and to sightsee areas that would be interesting for kids. We had the best time! Our two guides were not only funny but very knowledgeable. Taught us not only about the history but traditional customs such as how to pray in a Shinto shrine vs a Buddhist temple. My favorite was the cat shrine, even saw a stubby tailed white cat wondering around! The 2 hour tour was very in depth so if you're looking for a general tour then the one hour would be sufficient. I think the 2 hour was definitely worth it because my 10 year old got to ask a lot questions and we didn't feel rushed. I want to say special thanks to our guides, Akifumi Yamamot and Tatsuki Tsuji who made our first trip to Tokyo so awesome. Make sure to ask for them if you need English speaking guides."

We choose ebisuya because they had been friendly but not pushy when approaching us on previous trips and the day before when we didn't ride with them. 9000 yen for 30minutes seems expensive however the ride was so wonderful we might go again later in our trip this time and will definitely ride again next time we visit Japan. They provide a wondeful service of taking photos at various locations around asakusa on our own camera (no exorbitant professional photo fees so common at attractions) our daughter had so much fun waving at the pedestrians. The strength of these men and women operating these rickshaws are amazing and in the heat as well. Very impressive. The option of paying with credit card was a nice surprise and I took them up on it to preserve our precious cash. We went over the allotted 30minutes time and I began to worry that I would be forced to pay extra, but this was not the case, we had agreed upon the course before leaving and we completed this despite traffic lights causing delays. No extra charge for our 4 year old sitting on our laps.Wonderful, completing delightful!"

After they found out that my father speaks more French than English, the staff and guide greeted him in French and when taking pictures, counted down in french (\"un-deux-trois- cheese!\") We were pleasantly surprised by the efforts!Our guide Ryoma was funny, entertaining and knowledgeable of the area and its history, drew our attention on specific buildings and figurines (thieves on roofs) in the alleys, explaining what they meant. we saw the area from a totally different perspective from the rickshaw, and realized that although we just walked there half an hour before, we seem to have not noticed small details and the real character of Asakusa.We really enjoyed the ride and strongly recommend the service."

Our drivers were very friendly and accommodating and they knew much of the sites' history and story. Along the ride, you'll see a lot of locals milling the busy streets in Tokyo as well as get to see a side of Tokyo that would usually be not in your way as a tourist. It's fun to watch locals prepare for another busy day as well as get a glimpse of the everyday life of the people. Moreover, the sites seen are the ones that are worth visiting and those that have historical value in Tokyo. Lastly, the part that I enjoyed the most was talking to my driver. I learned a lot of things from him, especially about Tokyo. Overall, it was a great way to spend my 20 minutes in Japan and I even got to ride something that I think can only be found here! I wish it was longer to be honest (there are longer tours don't worry). Great places.Great people.Great service. Definitely a unique experience and definitely worth it! :) Note: our drivers were Yoshinaka-kun (with me) and Takagai-kun (with my sister and mom) :) thank you so much for your great service!"

Our issue was that it was difficult to take pictures or walk away from Noel without him asking you to stay with the group. We felt we missed many opportunities to take photos. 2. His famous phrase is not to make any sudden moves while biking, I understand that, but when he say's this all day long, it get's old. Our group consisted of pretty much all adults, no children, but we felt as he was addressing or talking to his children. Pros: 1. He has excellent knowledge and if you like history...this is the tour to take. 2. Keeping you super safe. While under my cons, I complained about this, if you're worried about safety, don't...he's good at making sure that he keeps you safe. I wouldn't take this tour again, but if you really like history and need someone to make you feel safe while riding in Tokyo...Noel your guy."

Noel greeted us right on time and had provided extremely easy directions on how to find him. He immediately treated us like long lost friends and made the day so much more easy going by doing so. Noel started with biking basics and some general rules for the day. Afterwards, we had a quick test ride to ensure the bikes were functional (and us as well). At first, it was intimidating to be riding bikes in an unknown city, but Noel's instructions prior to the trip reassured us and it was probably the safest biking I've done in my life. (Tokyo has laws that protect bikers and they are strictly followed)As we only did the half day tour, its hard to imagine how much more could be packed in to a full day tour (but don't get me wrong, I know it would be worth it). Noel visited various Tokyo locations and stopped at interesting places to deliver information about Tokyo's culture and history. His fluency in Japanese combined with his knowledge on Japanese culture and history made it more than just any other tour. He encouraged us to ask questions and was able to answer each one and expand on them in most cases. We visited one of the most famous bridges in Tokyo, the fish market, the Tokyo Station, the Imperial Palace, and a beautiful Japanese garden. Each location Noel made sure we got great pictures (he's an amateur videographer so the pictures were awesome). Without a doubt, this tour was absolutely worth the time and money. My only suggestion is to do the tour EARLY in your trip. If it rains, you may be able to reschedule, and if not, getting the information about Tokyo and Japan up front will make the rest of your trip more valuable. Oh, and make sure you have Noel point you to the best place for Ramen in the city, it's fantastic!!!"

No\u00ebl is a very experienced guide and is very protective but a little too much: keeps on pointing out that you can move 5 cm more to the Side walk, crossing the street is like crossing a war zone (two by two or one long line). What really set me off whas at the imperial palace: somebody appeoaching us wasnt paying attention and he bumped into HIM really hard deliberately telling he Should focus... All the spots we visited were nice and really good and No\u00ebl really knows the Japanse history and way of life. So, I think with kids this is a fantastic Tour and you will feel really protected but as some how experienced and mature people this really gets on your nerves"

We loved the first day so much that we decided to stay on board for the waterfront tour the following day. There was no one else except for my family on the tour, which was nice. I'm also glad I did the second day because it covered pretty much everything else I wanted to see in Tokyo, and I wouldn't have had the time or expertise to do it on my own. *Recommend that you do the tour in the beginning of your stay in Tokyo. Noel is very helpful and can give many tips regarding traveling through this city. In addition, you can pinpoint places that you want to explore in more depth in the coming days. *I don't regularly exercise and I didn't find the bike tour difficult at all. I was tired at the end of each day, but certainly not exhausted. Easy ride!"

Noel gives his all to create an amazing experience for everyone on the tour. He says that he puts our safety first and there were no disappointments there. In addition to this, he keeps the locals in mind and ensures that us tourists aren't blocking the way on the sidewalk. Even if you aren't a confident biker you should definitely consider this as a sightseeing option in Tokyo because the tour is well paced for differing levels of biking prowess. There are things that you just can't learn from reading a book and this kind of knowledge that Noel has accumulated over the years is something that can't be taken for granted. I feel like I could bike in Tokyo now if needed."

This, without doubt, has to be the best way to navigate Tokyo and all of its smaller attractions while taking in the sheer size of the metropolis. The tour guide, Noel, is highly experienced, as well as being extremely friendly and more than happy to field questions. Although the traffic in Tokyo is a bit disconcerting, Noel ensured that we all stayed safe while still being able to feel the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Even if you feel as if you are not a competent cycler, you have to give this a go - to miss out on this would be to miss out on the more down to earth parts of Tokyo as opposed to just seeing skyscrapers."

Tour guide Noel is extremely professional with his coaching and advice when facing the daunting task of hitting the streets of Tokyo on two wheels, and he is also very knowledgeable of the area the tour explores. This includes the well-known spots that attract thousands of visitors daily, and a few out-of-the-way locations that you may otherwise miss. Visiting cities usually means exploring the bits surrounding the main public transport hubs, but a guided bike ride joins up the dots and really gives you a feel for the place. No matter what your ability as a cyclist, this tour comes highly recommended."

You can ride on the sidewalks and streets in Tokyo so following him making the decision of when to ride where definitely helps get through crowded areas. We did a full day tour and saw way more than we would have ever seen otherwise. It's not hard biking, everything is relatively flat, but its a long ride for sure! Biking this much through the city gets you to see lots of main attractions but also just gives you a feel of how massive the city is and how it changes between neighborhoods. Other comments have said that you should do this on the first day. I agree. Coming from the states, you will be awake early trying to adjust anyway, might as well get on a bike and see the city. After that, you can decide what you'd like to re-visit or explore other areas."

If you have limited time in Tokyo to see the main sights, biking around with someone who has put a lot of thought into the itinerary and knows Tokyo well is probably the most efficient and fun way to do it. 2. The tour is safe - the bikes are well maintained, appropriate helmets are provided and Noel's priority is to keep everyone safe throughout.3. I did the cultural history tour and the waterfront tour - they are exactly as detailed on the website, are completely different and very complementary, I loved doing them on two consecutive days filled with adventures.4. Noel ensures all places on the itinerary are covered by smartly and diplomatically avoiding time wasting / lingering, yet allowing for plenty of photo/bathroom/cigarette/coffee etc stops as required.5. The size of the groups is very reasonable and the tour appears to attract nice interesting people - I joined one with 6 of us and the other with just 2 of us, and hope to stay in touch with several of them.6. Noel's character is ideally suited - he is knowledgeable about Japan and the sights, and is more than willing to share it all with the group. 7. The food stops are good.8. There is enough flexibility to accommodate reasonable requests which was much appreciated.Have fun and thanks again, Noel!"

We were somewhat lucky that we had Noel all to ourselves as my boyfriend and I were the only ones on the tour, but we could see how the tour would be a success regardless! Noel was extremely knowledgeable about Japanese culture, history and tradition and we learned a lot in addition to getting to see so many beautiful Tokyo sights. Our highlight was riding through Ueno park and admiring the last of the cherry blossoms and meeting a Sumo wrestler!We initially contemplated hiring bikes and doing a tour on our own, but in the end we were thrilled we let a professional do the guiding while we just followed and enjoyed the day.I was a little worried at first about biking through such a busy city, but this was not an issue at all as the roads felt very safe and Noel made sure to instruct and keep an eye on all things safety related. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone looking to see Tokyo in a fun and informative way!"

He was unbelievably nice, and extremely knowledgeable on what seemed like an infinite number of topics. The tour was set at a perfect pace, we never felt rushed or tired even though we were on it for nearly 9 hours. If you needed to stop for drinks, or bathroom, or smoking, there was always someplace close by. We had lunch at a typical salarayman restaurant. It wasn\u2019t expensive at all and gave a nice glance into the culture. I really don\u2019t have enough good things to say, and really don\u2019t want to spoil the tour for anyone wanting to take it. Noel is fantastic and willing to answer any question you might have, personal or otherwise. I highly recommend the tour, you will not be disappointed."

After a week of skiing in Niseko, this was the best way to spend a day in Tokyo. It was the highlight of our stay in Tokyo and it felt more like a bunch of young hearted guys just cruising around having fun, with some one (Noel) who knew exactly where to go and how. I booked the bike tour over the net, several weeks in advance from Sydney and the process and communication with Noel was excellent. Gloves, sun glasses and a warm jacket is a must in the winter time but the cold weather was not an issue, maybe we were enjoying ourselves too much to even notice. A full day bike tour of Tokyo with Noel is a must do."

Not only did it refresh our body but it revived our souls. A cool way to experience the Japanese atmosphere and indulge in the local food.

Although I lived in a big city, I thought I knew all there is to know about living in a rural area and making a living off the land as my grandparents lived this type of life back home and I visited their village every year. Boy, was I wrong! The Japanese farm that I visited had a very efficient way of doing things. They had a great system and you would be surprised to see such structure in agriculture. For example, the farm can predict with great accuracy which of their vegetables can be ripe for harvesting on a certain day. The farm's owner and his family are smiling all the time and they all seemed so happy. They seemed to have a great life and makes me want to swap my life with them. You won't believe the size of the vegetables that we took to cook our lunch. They tasted yummy! And I learned a thing or two about how to cook healthily without sacrificing on taste."

Once we got there, there were real life monks (I was amazed) that acted as guides. They were so serene and quite open, almost eager, to share their everyday life with us.

Although several touristy places were on my list, I also wanted to explore other options which would help me feel the real Japan, meet locals and get a taste of life in Japan. During my search for these places, I stumbled upon TABICA tours on Tripadvisor. Having read rave reviews, I decided to give it a try. However, I found it immensely difficult to choose just one tour. Since I was a bit short on cash, I told myself I can afford one of these as a treat to myself (it\u2019s not really expensive, it\u2019s just that I am a student!). And then began the thinking and deciding and exploring which lasted for days. I was particularly torn between the Bushido one and the Monk one. Finally, I decided on the \u2018A day in the life of a Monk\u2019 as I was particularly interested to see their living style and habits. The timing of the tour (1pm) allowed me to visit a site in the morning which was perfect. Harajuku station is easy to access via subway and the tour office is only 10 minutes walk from there. Thereafter, the tour company took over and I relaxed. There were 8 of us in the group which made it easy to get to know everyone before we started for the tour. The car ride was comfortable and I enjoyed the city views on the hour long drive. I also got to know my Argentinean companion who accompanied me in the car.Around 2pm, we reached the Honkouji temple in Ichikawa. Due to its distance from Tokyo, it\u2019s not crowded by tourists so the peace and serenity was felt immediately even before we got inside the temple. The temple has a lot of history and power spots. A monk was our guide for the day. A translator helped with what the monk said, which was such a relief after so many days of trying to understand Japanese. Thereafter, I watched them doing Japanese calligraphy which seemed so intricate and difficult. I tried my hand at it but I don\u2019t think I was any good. Haha. Later, I witnessed Matcha making. I love Matcha and had come to love it during my stay in Japan which included Matcha ice-cream, so seeing how to make it was a pleasure although I don\u2019t think I can make it. I tried a cup of it and it was delicious. Finally, we sat down with the monks to understand more about their lives and habits. I had tons of questions and I think I tired out the translator but both he and the monk were very patient and answered all my curious questions. It was enlightening to hear about their lives and principles.Finally, even though I wanted to stay on, I reluctantly got back into the car and reached Tokyo which seemed so farther away from what I had just seen.I would definitely recommend this tour for those who want to see much more than the city life of Japan. This was ethnic experience at its best. Highly recommended!"

If you do not like reading long reviews, to cut it short, here is my short summary, \u201cYou will 100% love going on this tour!\u201dI have always been interested in a spiritual life, esoterics and different unconventional practices all over the world. Having read a bunch of books about monks and their routine, I took an interest in this topic. My trip about Japan lasted for 2 weeks, the last point in my route was Tokyo, but then my Japanese friends recommended this tour. They said I would not regret it\u2026 and I never did! It was simply amazing. If you have a day or two, do not hesitate to go on the tour. When I arrived at my final destination, there was a guide (who was, actually, a real monk) who walked our group about the grounds of their settlement. The spirit of true calmness and genuine tranquility was in the air, it felt like I could become one of them after a week or two. When you are there, you are absorbed in this atmosphere and then when the tour is over you do not want to leave. I am sorry only about one thing, it is a pity I had just one day and there was no way for me to join other tours of this company.Talking about organization of the tour, everything was perfect, our host was nice, we could meet and actually communicate with monks, they introduced us to their routine and we could even try some of their activities. Before going on a tour, I was concerned about the number of people in the group, as some companies offered tours for 30+ people at the same time. Our group was not numerous at all, that was one more benefit for me.It is definitely a must see place!"

For most people, that is a huge turn off. Tabica, however, allows you to experience the very heart of Japanese culture that has been swallowed up by the rapid advancements. Tabica has a couple of options. You can devote your time to the art of Japanese Woodblock Printing, enjoy cooking activities with a master chef, make bamboo flutes, join the Japanese farmers in their daily activities in the outskirts of Japan, pray with a Buddhist Monk, or even spend your day with a Japanese Bushido Master.Although we tried to experience as many activities that Tabica had to offer, the most amazing time was that spent hiking on Japan\u2019s Nature trails. This is particularly for the nature-hippies who believe in saving the flora and fauna, especially the endangered ones. The trail is in Machida City, situated in the north of Japan. It is in the midst of the forest that has just started recovering from the rapid advancements that had almost enveloped it. The tour group is restricted to eight people. It passes through a dense forest that supports multiple endangered species of animals that are slowly coming back to their natural habitats. Apart from all the positive aspects, you might get lost in translation once in a while. Most of the people that you meet in this exploratory journey do not speak English which can sometime pose difficulties in understanding them. However, Tabica provides you interpreters during the tours to resolve this problem.Conclusively, Tabica is a unique experience that must be attended by all travelers looking to see the Japanese culture. The fees are nominal and completely worth it. We enjoyed every moment of our time with Tabica and would highly recommend to all who plan on visiting Japan."

You think Shibuya, Tokyo and all what pops up in your mind are neon lights and large crowds, only until you visit Tabica that the entire picture gets turned upside down! We have had the pleasure of spending an entire day with a monk and we couldn\u2019t be more honored to have him guide through the many faces of his pleasure-laden life! It has been an unexpectedly eye-opening experience that left us incredibly pleased and more than willing to try the different services this amazing and inspiring place can offer.Unlike most tourist-attractions in other countries, Tabica doesn\u2019t provide you a quick, commercial tour but with an actual, awe-inspiring one! You get to delve into the actual day-to-day activities of Japanese monks, learn about how they see the meaning of life and how simple their commute through it is. We really enjoyed every moment, specially the time we tea time at the end of the day. The tour is restricted to eight people only so you can fully submerge yourself into the experience. Throughout the tour you\u2019ll meet friendly native farmers that you will be able to interact with and it was quite lovely when we did. Overall, it is an unforgettable experience. The place is highly recommended for hardcore travelers who are looking to get deeply in touch with the core of the Japanese culture. If Japan is high on your bucket list then Tabica is a place that you can not miss!"

My husband and I are quite the adventurers and lovers of culture so we did the Nature Trail near Tokyo and interrogated the monk (lol).

Our host was a monk, the perfect person to show us around and explain every aspect of the culture that we don't get to appreciateon a daily. We sat down 'like the monks do' and he explained his daily routine to us. Had sumptuous tea as a group and listened to every word he had for us. Life here is awesomely different from what Japan had to offer. The ladies with their kimonos wore their respect on their shoulders. Envious to us who want to live in a culture where no phone is ringing, no technology is coming in between our daily lives. Then enviroment ozzed of zen and peace. so much so that 30 minutes is just not enough. One can never be too busy to visit Tabica. Very enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting to know more. It's a must visit if you can spare just 30 minutes of your time."

You may be surprised all Japan has to offer the tourist, outside of the usual attractions, of visiting there world famous zoo, with its pandas, the numerous shrines and shopping areas.Become one of the new tourists, that visit Japan, it is like seeing a hidden gem or behind the scenes of your favourite movie. Japan has mini tours available, to cater for most people's hobbies or interests. You could embark on a tour of Japanese architecture, through the centuries, hosted by a graduate in architecture who speaks English and is able to answer all your questions. Visitors could spend the day with Monks; experiencing how they live a traditional life; or learn tae kwon do, from a \"Bushido Master\", for four hours learning their techniques, this tour is held in the \"Dojo\" in Tokyo.For people who enjoy hiking and commuting with nature, or who believe in saving the environment and protecting endangered species in the wild. Japan has a three to four hour tour, that they will find enthralling. The tour is called \"Hike and Explore Japan's Nature Trails near Tokyo\". In the city of Machida, which is located in the western portion of the Tokyo metropolis, is the oasis that we are talking about. Machida has become a commuter city and takes approximately 50 minutes to commute to Tokyo; Machida is about 40 kilometres from Tokyo. Machida in its history was a farming community; but with Tokyo sprawling towards it, most of the farming land was bought for building homes and shops.Machida city realised because of all the buildings and the destruction of a large portion of the forested area in the city; that a lot of native species of birds and animals, have disappeared from the region. To try and reverse the action of what was occurring. Machida city, decided to set aside, the northern part of the of the city, to encourage the regrowth of the topography in the Yato way. This was achieved by resorting to traditional land management and using traditional knowledge to restore the forested area. This area looks like a mosaic patchwork of forests on the slopes, farmlands and human settlement. The city has built twenty traditional Japanese houses in this unique landscape.The tour group is restricted to eight people, so every is able to enjoy this wonderful experience. You are able to walk through the forests, where native animals are slowly returning. You are able to ask the farmers about the rice paddies, through a interpreter, to learn more about growing rice or you might be interested in how they have encouraged the native bird life to return. You may have questions about how they keep warm or live in the traditional houses. The visitor is able to see inside the houses, how a family would live in a traditional manner.Your tour starts when you get of the train at Harajuka Station, and meet your guide at Yoyog Park. You are then transported by car to the hiking area, ten minutes from the station. The group is accompanied by a local resident of the area and also a translator, to assist with any questions. After the is completed you return to Tokyo by train."

After a short introduction about the history and tradition of kaleidoscopes, the guide taught us how to create one and explained all the tips and tricks of the mechanics behind it. Then, it was our turn to build one. We really had fun crafting our own 'mangekyo', and we also had the chance to keep them!

What was worth paying for was the tour guide translating how the market runs and the inner secrets of the market. It also turned out the tour guide helps the security with translation too! The waiting time of 3 hours was spent sitting cramped with other humans like sardines on a hard wooden floor that was in a building next to the market. How ironic! I would recommend wearing pants or shorts and a cushy bum! The auction itself was very interesting and eye opening but we could only see it for about 30 mins. Then the rest of the tour involves walking around the market, visiting some shops. However, it was pretty dangerous as carts drive past you and the people in the market are pretty anti-tourists so it was a big change from the usually friendly Japanese people. The outer market was a lot friendlier tho and we managed to try sake and green tea. Our guide also recommended this amazing sushi restaurant where we had sushi breakfast and were stuffed by 8am. Overall, a great experience but a bit pricey. However, I would still do it again."

After choosing the fish we needed we went to a little building with three other holiday makers. The chef showed us how to prepare and gut the fish we had chosen prior to making our own sushi fromSea bream, yellow fin,mackerel, tuna, scallops with a selection of saki. Amazing day."

My wife and I tried to visit Tsukiji market the morning we arrived in Tokyo, and even though we had done a lot of research, we left feeling like we didn't really see or experience what it was all about. Then on our Mt. Fuji hike we met a couple that raved about this tour and said we had to try it, so we booked it the night we got back to Tokyo and we are so happy we did!We did the 8am market tour and sushi making class, and it was fantastic! Going through the market with an experienced guide makes all the difference, and seeing the inner market as we did will be a lifetime memory. The class was super fun, the chef was awesome, the food was phenomenal and every bit of the experience felt like it was catered to our exact wishes. I am so happy that couple recommended this tour, because otherwise we would have left Tokyo without these amazing memories."

It's easy to go to Japan to gorge on sushi and sashimi, but I think you gain another level of appreciation of the food when you know how it is being caught, handled, distributed and finally served on your plate.For the tour, you will need to arrive by 2:30am. I arrived a bit late and was told by security that the quota has been filled and to leave. Luckily the tour guide has good relationship with security and was able to hold my spot. However, it seems I could've lost it if I arrived even later. Around 4pm, one of the buyers will come in to give a run through of what usually happens during the auction. This was an excellent Q&A opportunity with an insider, so be prepared with some good questions.Be careful when walking around because the place is made for business and not for tourists. Bring some cash to buy the fresh goodies at the insider market and for breakfast!! It's a good place to splurge on food because you know it is FRESH!!"

My guide, Katsuhiko, was awesome. He knows everyone!!!! He got me the best position for the auction and then got me into the inner market and met with a bunch of wholesalers and workers. I really got an insider look at how the fish market works. Also, don't waste time standing in the ridiculous line at Sushi Dai, there are so many other great places to get your sushi fix at the market. Great experience!!!!"

My two kids (4 & 8) absolutely loved the whole experience. It was very informative from the beginning tour of the outside fish market, then inside the fish market, and finally the sushi class and tasting. You get to learn about each step of sushi making from how the fish is selected, to what exactly they do to the fish to keep it fresh (a bit gruesome to watch for first-timers), to how a fish is properly cut, and finally how a proper Nigiri is made and eaten. It's more than just sushi making since you get an escorted tour of the inside of the fish market before the general public is allowed to enter. The inside part of the fish market is a bit crazy and quite dangerous with all the trucks and sharp things moving around, I cannot imagine moving through there without a Japanese speaking tour guide. I would encourage people to do this tour soon since the fish market is moving to a new location in October I believe. This is the original location of the fish market and a must see. Overall, this was an awesome experience with the freshest sushi we tasted in all of Japan (even more fresh than the high-end restaurant we ate at called Kyubey)!"

Katsuhiko translated the auction and provided a exciting play-by-play experience. The market has so much history and is really a fish distribution power house.

            "review": "An Exceptional Way to Visit Tsukiji Market. My family of five spent a lovely morning with the team at the Sushi Insider Workshop as part of our visit to Tsukiji Market in Tokyo. For 95% of us who love food and adventure but don't really know how to filet a fish, prepare the basics around sashimi or sushi making or just to intimidated to ask your local, passionate sushi chef, this is a fine adventure. The $150 pp price tag is quite expensive relative to visiting the market on your own. However, given the ability to access several areas of the market before the public (just changed to 10am by the way, effective July 1st), the fact that a skilled, knowledgeable sushi chef with an excellent translator is on hand to talk through his morning purchases, and that you will undoubtedly eat more fresh, exceptional raw fish in a one hour period (the big finish), it is an experience very worthwhile.I found the tour team, led by the young entrepreneurial owner, to be professional, passionate and inviting. Every question found an answer. Every palate was satisfied, even my daughter who HATES raw fish. Long story for another day.The tour team also operates an auction tour and because of their connections throughout the market (I saw lots of access happening with security and other inner market vendors because of their solid relationships), being the very first in line at 3 am is not 100% necessary, if you book the tour company's small group (less than 10 people) visit. Again, I did not attend the auction so I could not give you any insight.But I would give a hearty big thumbs up to Sushi Insider Workshop for a fun filled morning and afternoon making sushi. If you are a michelin starred chef or on The Food Network, this is too basic for you. But for the 95% of us that crave travel adventure but want a little hand holding, this is a very fine tour."

Fresh off the plane only a few hours prior we walked to Tsukiji Fish Market building at 2:00 in the morning to meet up with Katsuhiko by 2:30am. We were informed by Tsubasa a few days prior that the meeting time had been changed from 3:30am to 2:30am because of the increasing numbers of people lining up for tours (Tsubasa does an excellent job communicating and organizing everything and even sends pictures at the end). With reservation we trudged on as visiting the fish market before it moves in November was the primary reason for the trip. To our surprise there were already people in line when we arrived and by 3:18am all 120 slots for the day had been given out.... I should not have doubted them\u2026 they certainly know their stuff! They are there everyday, know the market inside and out and are friendly with the vendors. In fact, Katsuhiko personally knows many of the security guards and even helps direct the tourists! He informed us of the best place to stand for the auction and told us what was going on as it was happening. He even took pictures of us, recommended places to eat and most importantly, took us into the inner market around 7:00-7:30am when there was still lots and lots of action going on and introduced us to some of the sellers and dealers. This is the REAL value of the tour! Normally the public (including other advertised tours) don't get access to the inner market until 9am when most of the action has died down. I know this first hand, because for the second part of the tour we signed up for the sushi making workshop and joined up with the rest of our family, getting to enter the market again at 8:30am to buy fish for the workshop and by then it was not quite the same experience\u2026 still good\u2026 but not AS good.Shopping with Morita san, watching him choose the fish and then having him give a step by step demonstration of the preparation is priceless; we even got to try slicing the fish ourselves. Their set up, located directly in the market place is super convenient. Morita san was very good with the kids and even gave us a few special treats. Making sushi is much harder than it looks but it was a fun and tasty experience with more than enough food. The food was excellent but the company even better. These guys are outstanding and top notch\u2026 professional and personable. By the end of the experience they kind of felt like family and I would not hesitate one bit to recommend them to my friends and family!"

We arrived at the meeting point, easy to find with signs and two or three people waiting for us. Gathered into a fairly large group of 13, but split into 3 groups so never felt crowded. Short walk to busting inner market. We first get to a vendor (fish monger) where we are shown several of the fish we will be eating a few hours later. They are still alive and then prepared in a style that allows for fresh sushi taste. We then spend time going though the market and seeing an amazing array of fish and sea life. So very sad to see this move in November but so happy to be one of the last to be able to experience this. We make it to the sushi studio, small air conditioned apartment on the third floor of the outer market. There we watch the preparation of nearly a dozen fish for our lunch. Hands on preparation allowed but the sushi master guided the entire way. Fresh wasabi ground by hand on shark skin paddle. Then we learn how to hand roll our own sushi or try sashimi style. Just fantastic. Even if you don't like the people on your tour you really are in your own group so great. Way more food than you can finish or need. The only thing I would suggest is actually LESS fish so as it doesn't go to waste. Great 4 hours and then to Narita back home!"

My friend and I took the tour in May and learned SO MUCH about Japanese culture and how they prepare their food. It was interesting to walk through the market and learn how to properly pick the right fish (I would've never been able to do this on my own!). After touring the Tuskiji fish market, we went back to a private kitchen to learn how to prepare our fish for sushi. We paid extra to have sake (trust me, it's worth it -- their sake selection is DELICIOUS!) and made a delicious meal with the fish we picked out from the market. Overall, I highly recommend this workshop. I had an amazing time - thank you to our guide and chef for the laughter and great food!"

I am loathe to make criticisms of a business with so many great reviews, but the truth is that my friend and I were truly disappointed at this experience. I am only hoping that my review will save someone the money that I regret spending on this so called 'sushi workshop'. Just to be clear, I am not disputing the customer service, I am unhappy with the fact that it was not what they advertised it to be. On their website, the workshop state \"The half-day workshop we at the Tsukiji Sushi Workshop are offering is aimed at people wanting to know not only how to prepare sushi, but everything from learning about the procurement of ingredients to presentation.\"The tour of the market wasn't bad, it just lacked a lot of vital information. The guide who was perfectly polite, as most Japanese are, didn't give any background or info about the market not even that it's the largest in the world, etc. He did point out some interesting things like sea urchin and fish roe, but if you are into Japanese food I would have though most people know what that looks like anyway. The guide functioned mostly as a translator. The most disappointing part of the so called sushi workshop was that it was entirely about assembling nigiri sushi - we didn't even cook the rice or get to cut the fish. If you already know the basics of how to fillet a fish, then the fish part did not offer much insight either. I notice one reviewer mentioned that the chef showed them how to position themselves at the bench and how to slice the fish but we did not get any of that. We also did not learn how to cook the sushi rice, it was purchased at the market and all we got to do was form the rice and fish into nigiri. A YouTube video could show you how to do that and you could practice yourself for a lot less than US$150. When I asked the guide if he could explain how to make sushi rice, he said that he would email us the recipe IF we wrote a TripAdvisor review. This is blatantly in violation of TripAdvisor's policy on incentivising reviews. If you are a foodie and already know the basics of how to select fresh fish (let's be honest all the fish at this market are fresh) and how to fillet a fish, this workshop is not for you. I truly though the workshop was a waste of money - use the $25 to buy yourself a great sushi lunch and $125 to buy yourself a nice Japanese made knife that you can keep instead."

When we had made all our purchases, we convened at the kitchen where the chef showed us how to make nigiri sushi. Then we were each provided with a good portion of sliced fish and a bowl of sticky sushi rice to make (and eat) our own. It was some of the best sushi I have ever had and I had A LOT of it.

I highly recommend the morning offering of the sushi workshop because you also get to walk around the Inner Market before the general public is allowed to. The day I did the tour, I was the only one who signed up, so it was like having a private tour. Chef Morita-san and translator Kaieda-san asked what kinds of fish I liked and customized the menu around that \u2013 I also told them \u2018omakase\u2019 if they saw something that looked good. One of the first things we did was to buy real wasabi root at a stall in the outer market \u2013 definitely a good start to the tour. Then we got to see the inner market. We got cherry salmon, first bonito of the season, yellowtail, and flounder (or a fish similar to flounder). Even though I was the only guest, they still bought enough fish for a whole group! I even got to see the special way to butcher one of the live fish that we prepared later.Back at the studio, Morita-san prepared the fish into fillets. At the same time, he created a tasty fish stock with the remaining bones. I tried my hand at some of the sogi-giri cuts to make nigiri sushi \u2013 I definitely will need more practice. He also showed how to shape the sushi. There was so much fish, and he also served up some fire-roasted (via blowtorch) slices of the fish. To finish off this great meal, he served up a cup of piping hot fish stock. A great way to experience Tsukiji and sushi!"

Joined this Sushi Work Shop with my American husband and a friend from the SF Bay Area. All of us are foodies and keen amateurs. We are extremely happy that we made it before Fish market moves to Toyosu location. The lesson starts with the shopping inside the fish market, which is an exciting rare experience as well. You can learn the professional secrets - inherited Japanese knowledge and skills how to deal with the fish. No doubt eye-opening experience even for a Japanese. The hands-on lesson inside the classroom is very well organized. Starting with chef's demonstration, followed by volunteer hands on trial to de-born and slice the fish. We did scallops, too, out of shells. Then all the participants can make your own nigiri on your table. We enjoyed good sake as optional choice. Great choice of sake. Never crappy. Chef Morita-san is very friendly and experienced to share the tips how to position yourself against the counter top and and how to use the Japanese sashimi knife. Hayashi-san and Kaieda-san were very knowledgeable and helpful as well. They also shared the good Sushi place they recommend, which was a big bonus, too. Overall, very valuable experience and so happy we did ! Highly recommended for foodies keen about hands-on lessons, but also never compelling pressures even if you just wish to observe, hands-off and eat Sushi !"

Only one in our party actually ate raw fish (my husband), but I wanted to see the market and have our kids experience it as well. We discussed this in advance and they indicated they would have other options available for us to eat. A day or two before the tour, they sent a reminder email with directions for a taxi in Japanese kanji as well as the subway meeting point. This was very appreciated as we got a late start the morning of and ended up hoping a taxi. Unfortunately, despite giving the driver the instructions in Japanese, the taxi dropped us at the wrong location. Panicked we called the numbers provided and they came and found us once we were able to describe our location. Whew!  I thought based on the emails from them that mainly dealt with the tuna auction (we did the sushi making in the morning) that it would be a humongous group. It was not, as there were only 10 in our group, which was a great size and then they broke the group in 2 as we walked through the market. They explained what we were seeing along the way, and walked us through to the inner market. We were there right before the general public could get in, so things had calmed down a bit, but were still crazy busy. It was very interesting to watch the merchants at work, mini forklifts darting all over, preparing seafood, and in general see how it all functioned.  Back at the kitchen area (studio) was where it was really fun, listening to and watching how to prepare a fish, learning about what is in season, learning about Japanese customs surrounding it all, just so interesting. When they noticed our kids didn\u2019t have anything to eat, they ran downstairs and bought both veggies and meat for them. They also \u2018cooked\u2019 with a blowtorch some delicious cherry salmon for me to eat. They were very accommodating, fascinating to listen to and the combination of backgrounds of the folks leading our tour gave us what was the highlight of our trip to Japan for my sushi loving husband.

I had a guided tour in the outer fish market (where they showed me how to choose the wasabi root) and the inner fish market (where we saw all different types of seafood including puffer fish, which I was interested in seeing alive). Since we had some extra time, the guide showed me how to pray in the Japanese shrine nearby. It was such a wonderful experience - a really important part of the cultural experience! I would do it again and recommend others to attend this workshop."

We felt like we had an insider's perspective as we met people working in the market and saw the interaction between Mori-san and his suppliers. Chef Mori guided us every step of the way from electing the many different fish to preparing them to making sushi. It was the best and the most sushi I think we had ever eaten. And it doesn't get any fresher then live to table in minutes. Great family activity if you love food, markets and sushi!"

We truly felt like locals walking around the market with our wonderful guides who are not only extremely friendly but also a treasure trove of knowledge about not only seafood but also the history of Tsukiji Market. They were also extremely generous with the variety and quantity of food provided, way beyond our expectations. We were lucky to land right at the tail end of the Cherry Salmon season (delicious) and got to taste some amazing Blood Clams and massive Kuruma Shrimp that were so fresh they slapped you in the face when bit. We also had some delicious tuna (from South Carolina) and I believe skate or flounder. Being a rice lover though, the highlight was certainly the delicious rice, cooked just right and seasoned so well I'm unsure I will ever get to taste something of that level again. Do yourself a favour and head over to Tsukiji... It apparently won't be there for long now since it's moving to a new building."

He took us on a tour of the inner and outer markets and we picked up different types of fish for later- we got cherry salmon, tuna, seared squid, black clams, and flounder. The market is super interesting and you need a guide for the inner markets, so this was helpful. We took the fish back to the kitchen, in a building in the outer market where the chef met us. He skinned, gutted, and cleaned all of the fish and chopped up a bunch into sushi and let us try when we wanted to -- it is much harder than it looks! We took tons of pictures throughout and were able to taste the sushi while he was preparing it. You even get to grind the wasabi root! After everything is chopped up, we sat down and the chef taught us how to put the sushi pieces together with the rice - also not so easy! We changed off eating sushi and making it and there was plenty of food - I've probably never eaten so much sushi in one sitting and it was the freshest fish I've ever tasted! The chef made a bunch of pieces for us too so that we were able to enjoy it and not spend all our time making it if we wanted his help. Highly recommend!!! Super friendly staff, intimate experience, very professional and fun."

We had our own private guide, who was absolutely lovely and ensured that we had the best experience, leading us to the best viewing point of the tuna auction, the best photo points and explaining the entire process to us in well-spoken English. Following the Tuna Auction, we were shown the Fish Market. Most foreigners and individuals who do not work at the Fish Market are not allowed access until 9am. However due to special connections, we were allowed to walk through the market at 6am, with no other tourists there! It was amazing. Following the unique experience, we ran into the talented sashimi chef on his way into the market to buy fresh produce for the sushi making class that would start in an hour. The Chef was funny and interactive and everyone had a go at cutting the sashimi and learning how to slice it in the correct manner. After we did the sashimi slicing, we started making the rice into the special shape needed to be able to sit under the sashimi. It was so much fun and the staff were so attentive and friendly. Not only that, but the other guests on the tour were from America, South Africa, Australia, you name it - this great company is bringing in culturally interested individuals from all over the world. Finally, to make the day even better, there was a Sake buffet! Unlimited Sake, all different types, to drink with the sashimi. It was an extremely memorable experience that my boyfriend and I shared, and we are so so glad we decided to get up early, do the Tuna Auction, see the famous Fish Market and make sushi and sashimi as well as new friends. Thank you so much!!!"

They lead us to an apartment nearby and showed us how to clean the fish in a way suitable for sushi -- which was much more involved than I was used to and felt more like an autopsy which was really cool and eye-opening. Next, they taught us how to form the nigiri and grind the wasabi. The main focus of the class was on preparing the fish and forming the nigiri -- we did not make the rice or slice the fish which we were perfectly fine with. We were completely full after eating the sushi and half of it was left-over. They neatly packaged the sushi and sent it home with us along with a bottle of the chef's homemade soy sauce! We expressed interest in buying a knife and they took the time afterwards to introduce us to the knife store and owner. We decided not to purchase one but appreciated the gesture.

The price for this is also quite reasonable as you will have more than enough to eat to go along with the experience.We were fortunate to have the day to ourselves (2 of us) with the class being taught by a sushi chef and a translator for English speakers. His English is excellent and the two work extremely well together (We had Hirobumi Morita as our chef). The fish are selected based on the types you like, what is fresh in the market, and what the chef finds interesting. We had fatty tuna (better than any I've had in the US), Japanese Barracuda (smaller than most species and delicious), scallop, blood clam, baby sardines...and I think flounder and a snapper variety. At each step, the technique was demonstrated and we were given the opportunity to cut as much as we wanted. The instructions were great and you really have the ability to control how much you work and how much you watch.Rice was brought in from a rice vendor across the street and it was very well prepared. The recipe is provided for that as well. Plating was a fun experience and it really lets you do what you want from single rolls to nigiri to sashimi. The chef even brought out a torch to bring some extra flavor to a few of the pieces and so we could see the difference...a must try on the fatty tuna.This was a really great way to see the sushi process from start to finish, and you really start to appreciate the work that goes into good sushi. The fish you use in the workshop is excellent quality and extremely fresh -- The barracuda are fairly uncommonly used in the class but he was able to find some that were fresher than usual. One of the main reasons I would recommend pairing this with the tuna auction+tour that they offer is that the market is a completely different world once non-vendors are allowed access (workshop fits this time slot). The auction part allowed us to get access beforehand and there was a much larger variety and more activity at that point (6-8am)."

After touring the inner market and parts of the outer market to buy our lunch ingredients, we headed back to the 'classroom' to make the sushi. Both our chefs were wonderful, showing us the best and most efficient way to prepare the different fish.

The workshop taught my wife and I a lot of about the craftsmanship that goes into sushi making. The guides, Tsubasa and Morita, were very gracious in helping us foreigners learn about their culture and craft. Morita was obviously very skilled in picking out his fish and in his preparation of fish.There was a LOT to take in but it was fascinating to learn the differences in seasonal fish, how to find the right ones, and how to prepare each one for sushi. We should have brought a camcorder!We mainly learned to make nigiri so if you're looking to make something like California rolls or other Western rolls like that, this is not the right place. This workshop is all about Japanese style sushi so it's good to keep an open mind and palate.The best part about the whole thing is that we got to know our guides, Tsubasa and Morita really well that it felt like we were leaving our friends behind when the class was over. If you ever get a chance, ask Morita about the one time he almost died from eating pufferfish. It is a fantastic story!"

We had amazing experience with Tsukiji team, watched the tuna auction from the best spot, at the right time, our Tsukiji guide was very knowledgable about the auction and told us many interesting facts about it and Japan overall. After we had great tour around and saw fish market pre-opening. We defo recommend taking this tour, other participants around were a bit lost on whats going on and what to do- what to watch..but not us. At the end we had great breakfast at very local place with no crowds and delicious Japanese cuisine. Our guide took care of us from the beginning till the end of the experience - when heavy rain started he made everything possible to get as a cab asap and get safely back to our hotel."

We gained a fascinating insight from our sushi master in everything the market had to offer for an hour or so before heading to the small classroom in the market to watch, learn and make our own sushi. A really fantastic experience that I could not recommend enough. It felt personal, it felt real and it gave us wonderful memories.. and an amazing lunch!"

He expertly cut up the fish and allowed anyone who wanted to, to practice cutting up whole fish. We made a variety of nagiri and roasted scallops in the shell.

Being sushi lovers from Australia, we read the reviews on trip advisor and heard stories about this unique tour. It was fantastic and the guides Tsubasa and Sushi expert Hirobumi showed us an awesome day, with quality english interpretation and throwing in the odd joke or two. We begun by being guided through the marketplaces, both the outer and the inner market, and learning about the local produce, meeting different vendors and gaining an understanding of the area and its purpose. Once inside the main market we were able to learn about the seasonal fish and seafood, handling and the art behind picking the right one. After all of this, you take the produce back to the kitchen and the fun begins, sushi making! Even for us rookies, we seemed to get a hold of it pretty quickly. Slicing the fish was heaps of fun and I highly recommend this if your visiting Tokyo. Thanks for an awesome day."

Morita demonstrated cleaning large scallops then allowed us each a try for personal practice. This continued with filleting of mackerel, flathead and the prize...beautiful tuna! We prepared our wasabi and then sat around the table ready to make sushi. Again Morita showed us how to form the rice, place the wasabi and top with the freshly prepared ingredients. Beautiful sashimi! We all ate our fare until we could eat no more. The English speaking guides made this easy and the experience made our trip to Japan.

I have also taken a sushi making class before, but this class focused on the cutting of the fish, which is, for me, the more difficult aspect of the process since it is something that one hesitates to practice at home. I will definitely take this class again when I next go to Tokyo. I have already recommended it to several friends. I would recommend this to both those who never cook and to those who are experienced home cooks.If you like to take photos, then definitely bring your camera. There are a lot of things you will want to photograph, both at the market and during the workshop. Wear sneakers. Don't wear sandals or shoes that you would not want to get a little messy from walking around a place where there is a lot of water on the ground and that water may have a little runoff from cutting up fish."

If you ever wondered what goes on before that exquisite piece of nigiri sushi ends up on your geta during an omakase meal, this is a must do on your agenda for Tokyo. The Tsukiji fish market needs no introduction, but navigating the labyrinthean innards of the wholesale section is made that much easier with good guides Morita-san and Tsubasa-san. Of course, being the consummate foodie and aspiring home cook myself, I got a chance to pick and choose which seafood items we wanted for our sushi making experience, then followed the experts as we hunted down our assortment of live and live finished catch of the day. Learning how to shuck, clean and process the seafood for the day was very informative and instructional with experienced chef Morita-san. For the class that day, we ended up with hirame, suzuki, akagai, kaki, otoro and akami. During the process, the more squeamish were content to watch the live entertainment as scaling, filleting, skinning, cleaning and slicing went on. However, the organizers are very welcoming to participants, and for those with an interest in the culinary arts, this is where you get more than your money's worth. All in all, I highly recommend this for anyone with an interest in cooking, even if you're not going to run off and host sushi parties. Just the skill sets of choosing and processing seafood would be a great takeaway from this class. For those who want an informative guide and an authentic local experience, this fares pretty well too!"

His expertise was apparent and he managed the group well. Morita sprung into action during the shopping of the inner market. So many fish, so little time. The sushi workshop allowed time for two chefs (Morita +one) to demo their skills and then invite participants to try their hand at fish scaling and filleting. My kid did us proud! Lastly, we got to make our own little nigiri with a dab of freshly grated wasabi (Tsubasa's touch) and lay on slices of five different fishes.

I\u2019ve had countless meals and sushi since I returned to the states, but nothing remotely compares to what I had at this cooking class. We first started off the cooking class by making a trip to the market at around 8:30am. Tsubasa and Mr. Morita were both extremely welcoming and friendly and knowledgeable about the market and industry. As we walked around the market, the two of them explained how to pick good fish as well as the history and general mannerisms of the fish market. Mr. Morita has been a chef in the area for many years, so he knew everyone \u2013 literally shadowing a local for a few hours in both the inner and outer fish market. Tsubasa and Mr. Morita were especially good at taking into account what I wanted to eat, and we ended up picking scallops (still in the shell and oh so delightful), tuna (didn\u2019t know tuna this good existed on Earth) and sea bass (cannot stop thinking about the sweet richness). The cooking class after we picked out the fish was extremely comprehensive, and I learned how to skin the fish, descale it, clean it, cut it, and make sushi with it. My teachers were extremely patient and the filled with laughter; eating, making sushi, more eating and lots of jokes in between, I felt not only to have learned so much, but also to have made new friends \u2013 a true cultural exchange.

Great fun to learn about buying fish, what to look for when buying to make sushi vs cooking fish. Lots of details on how to fillet the various fish/shellfish, how to prepare it for sushi.

Even though we go at the end of the market hours and there are lots of tourists with cameras, it's an incredible experience. So many fishes you never knew existed, huge slabs of tuna, beautiful uni, it goes on for row after row into the dimly lit distance. Tsubasa was knowledgeable and friendly, showed us lots of great stands, and then took us to buy fish. We learned about feeling the gills (deep red and slimy is good!) the color of the skin, how good squid reacts when you touch it. And then we were off to watch the filleting. After learning the differences in preparing sea bream, sea bass, flounder, blood clam, squid, and scallops (and tuna, but we had just bought a piece of a tuna, not the whole fish!), it was time to make the sushi. Some people had the discipline to make a whole plate of sushi before starting; I couldn't wait. Make a piece, eat it. Pleasant staff, a fun group of people on the tour - it was a lot of fun."

She e-mailed us programs to read in advance, so we can read them at our leisure. We were a family of 3 (with an 11-year old) and the tour was tailored to all of us with historical facts about the kabuki itself, interactive experience for the 11-year old, and specially designed programs for the show we were about to see. The tour included lecture on kabuki, visit to a very interactive kabuki museum and some good tips on what to get (food, guides) or visit (paintings exhibition) while at the theater. In my opinion this is a must do attraction while in Tokyo not only because you will learn about Japanese theater and culture, but you will be learning it from extremely knowledgeable and simply amazing person.

Her talk helped us to understand Kabuki and everything that was going to happen in the theather, while seeing the performances.We bought 3A grade tickets and I regret I did not spend more money and got better seats. If you are tall these ones are a bit uncomfortable.Do not forget to hire the English subtitles devices as they are a must to follow the plays.My oldest daughter loves drama so she was very excited about going to this tour and seeing the plays but even my youngest, who is not so much into drama enjoyed the experience.

I was not disappointed when the opportunity finally presented itself to have both wishes fulfilled! Kazui was absolutely wonderful and immensely helpful every step of the way, I would not have had the same depth of appreciation if I had not participated in this tour. Before I had even left my own country, Kazui sent through seating plans, maps for where we would meet, and backstories each of the plays I would be seeing! I purchased a box seat ticket on the 2nd floor (I think the 1st floor box seats they deliver your food to you) which was well worth the additional price as I had one of the best views of the stage in the theater. Kazui also helped me purchase a bento box (delicious) and English subtitle guide beforehand. The pre-performance lecture was fantastic and she broke down everything from the actors lineage to the symbolism of each characters makeup. Make sure to leave plenty of time to purchase a taiyaki (fish-shaped cake filled with sweetened bean paste). Kazui swears the ones purchased at the Kabuki-za theater are the best in Tokyo and as someone who is now a converted fan of Japanese sweets and deserts I concur!! As for the kabuki plays - breathtaking. I intend to return to Japan within the next two years and I will most definitely do this tour again."

While I've previously experienced kabuki and enjoyed it very much, I found that everything Kazui-San taught us really enriched the experience. After understanding more about both the history of kabuki and the techniques used both on and off stage, it was much easier to wholeheartedly engage in the action. I found the production fascinating (and unusual from a Western perspective) since every character in this act was sympathetic, and there was no \"villain\". As someone who is interested in Japanese history, I found the interplay between truth and fantasy very compelling, and this has changed the way I now think when I read history. Without Kazui-San's thorough explanations about kabuki conventions, I might have found these changes confusing, but certainly would not be able to identify with the real historical figures portrayed in this show so well as I do now. I was also very impressed with the way in which Kazui-San catered for a group with widely different knowledge bases (both about Japan in general and kabuki in particular). I attended the show with my father, who is very limited in his knowledge about Japanese culture. She ensured that all her explanations were both clear for a kabuki \"beginner\", and in-depth enough to be interesting for someone with some background knowledge. Kazui-San purchased us the most amazing tickets: sixth row, immediately next to the hanamichi runway. I really couldn't have hoped for better! She really went above and beyond to ensure that my father and I had a fabulous time at the kabuki. I'll certainly be booking another tour next time I'm in Tokyo!"

After tea we visited a small museum dealing with Kabuki theatre, then Kazui helped us purchase bento boxes to eat during intermission, just like most of the Japanese audience! Lastly, Kazui took us to our seats in the theatre and showed us how to use the translator, which was great!We enjoyed the Kabuki plays very much, however, the theatre was very hot in the first balcony. Kazui's lecture was very helpful and we noticed more because of her explanations. The acting, music, sets and costumes were wonderful!

Kabuki performances at the renovated and 2013 reopened Kabuki-za theatre in Chuo Tokyo are usually from the 2.nd to the 26th of the month. One can look up the dates, times and titles of performances for the current month and the next two coming months on the online Tokyo Kabuki guide. As first timers we really appreciate Kazui Yabe, a licensed Kabuki guide \u2013 interpreter, who made our Kabuki-experience a memorable one. My husband and I were in Tokyo for a week with May 2, 2016 being our last day. One month before we left for Tokyo I contacted Kazui and ordered the Kabuki tickets for May 2, 2016. This gave her enough lead time to buy the tickets at the presale, which for May 2, 2016 performance occurred in second week of April 2016. Using email Kazui edxplained all the things I need to know to see the performance. The audience sits in first, second and third floor. The most expensive seats are the box seats on left and right of the first floor. Actors enter and exit the stage via a long, raised walkway on the left of the first floor seating area. This walkway, called Hanamichi, divides the first floor into one small and one larger areas of seating. Since the actors mostly face the larger seating area, I like to be seated in the larger seating area in order to see the primordial facial expressions of the actors. During the intermissions people opened their bento boxes to have their dinner. You can buy the bento boxes from one of the restaurants in Kabuki-za or from outside stores. We opted to have dinner in a restaurant after the performance. The audience was dressed nicely. Many women as well as men came in elegant Japanese kimonos. The Kabuki show on 5/2/2016 was exceptional because of the formal introduction of a two year old Kabuki actor by his father and grandfather, two established famed Kabuki players. It was a sold out performance. Kazui herself attended the same evening performance as us but sat at a different location than us. During the intermission though she came to check on us, to see that everything is OK. Kazui Yabe is a very dedicated tour leader.Excluding three intermissions, the Kabuki performance lasted about 2hrs 50 minutes. After each act is an intermission for refreshment with the three intermissions totaling about 70 minutes altogether. Kazui\u2019 synopsis and the English subtitle made it easy for us to follow the play. It was a most brilliant show of unique music, acting, dancing, limited but clever stage technique, all the while with outlandish painted faces and costumes. The four acts were first performed in year 2016, 1860, 1808 and 1867, in that order. The most riveting was the last act about how one of two female dancers was revealed to be a man. Both \u2018female dancers\u2019 were performed by two famous male Kabuki actors. Their sinuous and graceful movement were a delight to watch. The highlight of our 7 day trip to Tokyo was indeed the Kabuki performance. Thank you Kazui for being our excellent Kabuki private guide!"

Do splurge if you can afford it to get close, ground-level seats for a once-in-a-lifetime theatre experience. Do buy a Bento box and fishcake to eat in your seat.

For me and my couple it was the best way of conclude our trip to Japan and i can assure that if you love arts and specially the theathre, the Kabuki experience will change the way of seeing it. But, as a totally different kind of theatre (in comparison with the western style), you need a guidance to comprehend the basics. Because of that, the guide provided by Mrs. Kazui its essential. Besides, she\u00b4ll make the moment illustrative and enjoyable."

I have always wanted to see a traditional Kabuki performance in Japan, and so I researched performances and tour guides. I accidentally landed on Kazui Yabe's information while doing a Google search, and contacted her. She provided me with excellent information and arranged everything beautifully for a reasonable price. She purchased the tickets, emailed me excellent and detailed English summaries of the Kabuki plays I was to attend, described in great detail where I was sitting, emailed me the theater floor plan and photos of the seating arrangement, and arranged a brief meeting where we would have a pre-performance meeting of tea, green-tea ice cream (delicious!) and she lectured on Kabuki. Her background information was fantastic, and very good. Without her assistance I would not have understood nor would I have appreciate the performance as much as I did. After her lecture, she walked me to the Kabuki-Za Theater, graciously took pictures of me in front of the theater, toured me around the theater, helped me purchase a yummy bento box, and gave me last minute information about the production! I loved the performance(s) and even though I do not speak Japanese, my love of music and theater makes me try to attend some kind of live performance wherever I travel in the world. Her English summaries and lectures made it unnecessary for me to know Japanese -- I understood everything and enjoyed the performance a great deal. I highly recommend trying to see Kabuki when you are in Japan, and if you are in Tokyo, definitely contact Kazui Yabe!"

We wanted to attend a Kabuki performance but were unsure about how to go about it. I read about Kazui Yabe's tours on another website and emailed an inquiry to her. I received a prompt response with thoughtful answers to all my questions. She offered to purchase tickets for us (in the section we desired), meet us at the theater for tea, sweets and a pre-performance private lecture before the show. I was pleasantly surprised on all counts. She loves Kabuki, is extremely knowledgable and does a very professional job of explaining what we would see, complete with illustrations. Her presentation provided us exactly the right amount of information to thoroughly enjoy the two pieces we saw. We thought we might be overwhelmed by this new-to-us form of theater but with the background we received we found we loved every minute - even though the performances ran four hours, with intermission. We highly recommend this tour."

What a wonderful and interesting experience it has been!!! Besides the fact that she is extremely knowledgeable about Kabuki in particular and all other Japanese traditional performing arts, Kazui-san is totally nice and open to illustrate to foreigners the Japanese way of life. Both times at the Kabuki-za have been mesmerizing, as the visual impact of the plays is fantastic \u2013 and even if I do not understand the language I was able to follow the storyline thanks to the lecture previous to the show and have a wonderful time! This last May, since we knew each other already, we also enjoyed some sort \u201cextra-curricular\u201d activities, so we went to have dinner at a wonderful izakaya and also to a marvelous sushi bar, and she was extremely helpful to explain all the different ingredients and dishes that we were eating.I totally recommend her tour, also because you can really feel how dedicated and passionate about the Kabuki theater she is.Hopefully I can go back to Tokyo sometimes soon and enjoy another spectacular Kabuki night!"

The guide purchased Kabuki tickets for us, met us before the performances, took us to a tea shop and discussed Kabuki with us, and then walked us to the theatre. After hearing the guide\u2019s insightful talk, we were surprised by how much we enjoyed the performances.\u00a0I\u2019d expected to have a much cooler response to an alien art form, and so many reports we read online, etc., seemed to suggest that while interesting, this form of theatre was slow-moving and boring to Western eyes and ears.\u00a0But we weren\u2019t bored at all. It was like watching Western opera and dance both at the same time.\u00a0We found the differences between the three plays we saw fascinating: the first a melodramatic soap opera, the second an amusing comedy of errors, the third a stately dance ritual. And yet all were clearly Kabuki, all shared similar uses of stage conventions, makeup, etc. It reminded me of the Japanese meals we ate while we were there\u2014a little of this and a little of that, tastefully arranged and all forming a harmonious whole. We were intrigued by the combinations of sights and sounds and movements\u2014and especially perplexed and intrigued by the switches between the actors and the narrator in describing the feelings and responses of the same character. We were sometimes bewildered by the characters\u2019 assumptions about the proper way to behave to one\u2019s master or servants and such, and intrigued to be bewildered in that way. It implied a whole range of cultural assumptions previously unknown to us, and gave us new ways of thinking about the contemporary Japan outside the Kabuki theatre. While renting the English translation guide was a big help, I\u2019m quite sure that it was less so than all the information the guide provided us with before we arrived at the theatre. We were especially intrigued to learn about the relationships among the Kabuki actors. All in all, the whole experience made for an excellent and worthwhile day.\u00a0"

As a result, it is nearly impossible to understand without explanation. Kazui Yabe is an expert on kabuki; her pre-performance lectures--typically over local sweets and tea--provide important context that is essential in order to understand the performance. Her explanation focuses specifically on the performance about to be viewed, but also more generally on the history of kabuki, the kabuki stage, the lineage of kabuki actors, and the meaning behind the intricate makeup designs. I have attended four of her kabuki lectures, and have learned something each time. If you are planning to see a kabuki performance, I very strongly encourage you to retain Kazui's guide services."

Kazui was so helpful while we were planning our trip, replying to multiple e-mails with great advice on what types of seats to purchase and with other information on what people usually do about meals while at Kabuki, etc. She purchased the tickets for us, which was an enormous help and arranged to meet us outside the theater on the day of the performance. We went to a tea salon for tea and a sweet (included in her very reasonable price) and she gave us information on Kabuki and the particular performance we were seeing. She even had handouts for us. Then we toured the little museum at the theater before the performance. During the first intermission in the performance she helped obtain a particular type of sweet that she had recommended that was sold at the theater and brought it to us after we looked a little confused about how to go about finding the vendor ourselves (which was really above and beyond what we would have expected). Kazui has a lot of enthusiasm for Kabuki and really wants to share her love of Kabuki with visitors. She made the process of seeing Kabuki very easy and really enhanced our enjoyment of it. We wouldn't have had nearly as much insight into what we were seeing had we tried to do this on our own. I highly recommend doing this tour!"

Saiko and Asami are extremely friendly, kind, and welcoming. Even if I went alone, they made me feel \"at home,\" and there was never a dull moment during my visit. They showed me around Asakusa area in Kimono, they gave me more information about the area, as well as information about the Japanese culture. I also got my Kanji name. The calligraphy itself is art at its finest! It is most definitely the best and the most unique souvenir anyone could ever have while in Japan. To foster a lovely cultural exchange, I translated their names to Baybayin calligraphy. This is a unique experience, and I am highly recommending this to anyone who plans to wander around Asakusa area :)"

Because my adult daughter and son were visiting Japan for the first time, I really wanted an opportunity for them learn something about Japanese culture by meeting/interacting with Japanese people, in addition to visiting tourist and shopping sites. After reading about Kanji House on TripAdvisor, I emailed Rena Makita and we made plans to visit Kanji House a Friday morning after seeing the Sensoji temple. We were greeted at Kanji House by Asami-san, who interviewed all of us to learn more about my daughter and son as people. Based on the information that she gathered, Asami-san came up with with the Kanji characters for their names, and we were surprised how perceptive Asami-san was in selecting the specific characters with their meaning.We had a lot of places to visit that day because we were in Tokyo for only two days, so our visit was short, but I will say without hesitation that the visit to Kanji House was an absolute must! This isn't a touristy site where everything is \"packaged\" Disneyland style, but a real opportunity to interact with Japanese people and experience their culture.If there's one thing I would suggest to the young ladies at Kanji House: the time that you spend and the unique experience you offer is worth more than 1000 yen - I think most tourists would be happy to contribute 1500 yen/name to Kanji House."

Immaculately dressed in a traditional komono, she started to explain the experience available to me at Kanji House. At first I was unsure being wary of the potential of a tourist trap but remembered I was in Japan where this is unlikely to occur. Rena explained that Kanji House was run by students and an opportunity to have my name written in Kanji as a momento. I enquired about the cost and was told it was up to Y2000 (USD17/AUD22) but other options were available too.While we took the 5 minute walk to Kanji House we chatted about my travels and Rena's studies.The steep stairs of Kanji House opened to a room where I met Yui. After being served with green tea, Yui asked questions about my name, my personality and thoughts on different topics. After some reflection Rena dipped her brush into the ink and painted three Kanji characters onto a sheet of beautiful rice paper.Yui then explained the meaning of each character and how it related to the pronunciation of my name and my personality traits.Unable to select a frame due to baggage restrictions, I chose a Sumo motif from a selection of Japanese cotton sheets and this was folded into a frame for me by Rena.Overall, it was one of my best memories from Japan and in the end the only souvenir I brought home with me.If you would like to experience some real and traditional sharing of Japanese culture I would highly recommend Kanji House to you.I hear that the venture is struggling to stay open, so please support Kanji House and experience one of your best memories of Japan.Thank you Rena and Yui!"

However we were pleasantly relieved when we saw the sign for Kanji House and entered the building. Asami and Nozomi were incredibly nice and friendly and spent lots of time learning about us, deciding the kanji for or names and teaching us about kanji, and also showing us some origami and other Japanese things. We really enjoyed our visit to Kanji House and it was not something we were expecting to do at all. If you do get the chance to visit, you really must!

My husband and I visited Japan in October 2015 for our 35th Anniversary and while wondering the streets of Asakusa we were approached by a beautiful, soft spoken Japanese girl dressed in a Kimono asking us if we wanted to visit her studio to have our names written in Kanji. My husband and I were hesitant as that is exactly what tourists are told not to do, do not follow a stranger, but for some reason we followed her and was so happy we did.We entered a beautiful Japanese room with Tatami mats and were greeted by another Japanese gentle beauty with two cups of green tea. We had great conversation while our names were carefully painted in Kanji with Indian Ink on parchment paper. We had planned to buy a Japanese souvenir however once we saw these depictions of our names and personalities in Kanji buying any other souvenir no longer seemed meaningful.It is such a worthwhile experience, we paid CDN$20 for each frame but it was worth every penny, spending $100 on another souvenir would not have been as meaningful.It is uncharacteristic for us to have followed a stranger as a tourist but it was the best decision we made, we not only had an authentic Japanese experience we met two lovely Japanese flowers and walked away with a lasting memory.So if you are in Asakusa please be sure to check out the Kanji House it will be an experience that money cannot buy."

So we decided one morning to jump on the metro and head straight there. Only once we got off the train and up to the main streets of Asakusa did we realise that we never actually asked anyone what to do in Asakusa. Whilst walking through the streets, most likely looking like the lost tourists that we were, we were approached by Rena and Yui who asked if we were interested in having our names wrote in Kanji and that they were students at Tokyo University. After chatting for a little bit my friends and I decided to to go with them to there shop to have our names created in Kanji.The experience itself is free and they give you your name in Kanji on a piece of paper but if you want your new Kanji name put into a frame you will have to buy the frame which is reasonably priced which we did as it protects this souvenir and looks rather smart.Rena and Yui were extremely kind and polite and even showed us around their shop which is set up like a traditional Japanese home. I even beat my friends at the toy game of getting the ball in the cup.I would strongly suggest that people visit Kanji House as it is a fantastic experience with great people and you get a meaningful souvenir out of it."

They took us to their charming little shop decorated in Japanese style. There they took their time getting to know us so they could write our kanji. One tip, if you're practising a Japanese martial art you can ask them to write your dojo name in kanji instead of your name.They also took their time for getting some nice group pictures.Also they offer to write your kanji for free, you only have to pay for a frame or a wrapping if you want it. I'll advice to take at least the frame because the time spent with these gentle people is priceless. This was one of my best experiences while visiting Japan and I highly recommend looking them up."

But since my family is visiting I had to take them around I chose to go the ancient gem the Sensoji Temple. On my way I bumped into a immaculately dressed lady who was offering to translate our names into Japanese and I just gave it a go! And I am glad I did, she not only translated our names but also made origamis for us. The service was and courtesy very real. I highly recommend everyone to give it a go!"

I was wrapping up my visit to the Sensoji Shrine in Asakusa when a lady dressed in traditional Japanese kimomo invited me to their establishment called 'Kanji House'. The ladies - Nozomi and Asami - were very hospitable and friendly. They drew my Kanji name out and explained many things about the language and other aspects of Japanese culture. It was a unique experience and I enjoyed it immensely. The shop too was very traditionally designed and interesting. I left with a beautifully drawn Kanji version of my name and I bought a few pretty traditional scarves for my relatives. I highly recommend any visitor to Tokyo should check out Kanji House.Thanks to the folks at Kanji House for my Kanji name and a pleasant end to my day."

First let me say that why there's no waiting line to access to this little gem, is a mystery to me. 37 \"excellent\" rates out of 37 reviewers can't be wrong! This place excels indeed and was one of the most special moments, and no doubt the most authentic, in my two weeks trip around Japan. Do yourself a favor and do not miss the opportunity to visit them.Now, for the longer version.Keywords: magical atmosphere; pure traditional entertainment and learning; perfect example of japanese kindness and hospitality.My brother and me were on a visit to Senso-ji temple when two charming ladies (Asami and Naoko) approached us offering to write our names in Kanji in their nearby store. The idea appealed to us, so we walked there with them, just 2-3 minutes away from the temple entrance. We immediately breathed the extremely peaceful atmosphere of the place, filled by Asami and Naoko's parsimony. They brought us tea, explained a bit of Kanji writing and started to work on our names. In sum, they pass latin character names to Kanji, trying to match the symbols with personality (they asked a few questions regarding ourselves) with a full explanation of the process and the meaning of each Kanji. While Asami, with extraordinary kanji-writing skills, wrote several beautiful versions of our names (so you can chose the one you like the most), Naoko provided colorful paper sheets to teach us origami (we made a very nice crane, mine is decorating my bedroom now :-). We left the place so glad and relaxed, a need in the busy Tokyo, thinking how peaceful the last 25 minutes of our lives had been. The price? Please, pay attention to this humble reviewer, and check for yourself how low cost a genuine and unique experience can be. I guarantee it will be a highlight on your trip!"

Only few times in ones life, a real experience results better than a dream of it.That is what happend in my trip to Japan, and probably one of the best experiences in the whole journey was the visit to Kanji House. In traditional Asakusa district, two lovely and smiling ladies, dressed in beautiful Kimonos, approached me kindly and explained their newly crowdfunded business, to write your name in japanese Kanji. Beeing a japanese art lover, I accepted, curiosly, to see where this experience would take me. We walked a few blocks, and got to a traditional japanese house, where in the second floor, Norie San and Akane San had their business, beautifully decorated. We talkes a little so that they could find out a little more about me and my life, because it is not only that they will write your name translating or transcripting it into Kanji, they really fin a meaning for each Kanji, that suits a positive caracteristic of you. Then, with brush, ink and rice paper, they write you new name in Kanji, explaining why they chose each kanji (and give you a certificate of the visit and the explanation to each Kanji). Norie San and Akane San were always very friendly, smiling, and the best host there can be. I walked back to my hotel with a smile from ear o ear, and my Kanji, framed (a must!!!) under my arm. I hope everyone can enjoy this experience aswell! :) My sincerest and warmest regards and congratulations to Norie San and Akane San."

Being of Japanese ancestry and living in Hawai'i, I am very familiar with Japanese foods but still felt this tour taught me a lot. It was very informative and I especially loved hearing about how each shop not only sold specialty food items, but went into great lengths to duplicate the shop's interior using materials (i.e. stone flooring from Castles, gold leaf, etc.) from the representing prefecture. Normally, I would not pay much attention to these details, but left with a great appreciation for the aesthetic value as well as the food. Just a warning though. This tour is by no means a \"food tour\", so it's not be confused with replacing a meal. It's more of a learning experience and highly recommended!"

The tour is good for people who want a short overview of the gourmet-story of Japan. The guides are explaining everything what you see and you can even try most of the stuff -sweets and so on. They were always friendly and spoke in a pleasant speed to us. We really enjoyed our time in the curedo mouromachi centre and are looking forward to visit the centre and the friendly ladies again :)!!"

We were able to do a combined tour covering the shopping areas and the shrine and it was the perfect introduction. We learned the correct ways to behave at a shrine, and a brief background of each of a few traditional industries or products. The guides were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I'd recommend this to anyone with an afternoon to spare as it gave me new insights into various aspects of Japan, and set my daughter up with a good introduction to Japan."

The office is easily accessible by both the subway and JR lines and then a short walk from the station. I was booked on to the Old Town tour, which was a whole day tour, and ended up having the whole tour to myself! Aki was my guide for the day and he was absolutely fantastic. He looked after me very well throughout the tour. He knows a lot about all the places we visited and introduced to me the fascinating Japanese cultures! We even visited some of the hidden places and neighbourhood areas which are not listed in the itinerary on the website, which made the tour extra special! I had a fantastic time on the tour and plan to join another tour when I visit Tokyo again in the future! I definitely recommend the bike tours for those who wants to see a little more of Tokyo!"

Soshi was our guide and gave us excellent rain gear, including shoe covers, in addition to good quality bikes with proper Shimano gears! We came back dry having seen a lot of Tokyo. It is all flat, so very easy and Soshi was an excellent leader giving very clear directions, where to turn and slow down, and he was very informative about not only the sights, but also the customs of Japan. Very safe too as cycling in Japan is allowed on most pavements (generally wide in Tokyo) and even one way smaller streets with few cars and interesting lanes to avoid the main thoroughfares. Thoroughly recommend it."

I have taken one day bike tours in New Orleans, Berlin, Sao Paulo, Rio, Paris, Munich, London, Amsterdam, New York, Chicago, Florence, Madrid, Toledo, Barcelona, and Victoria. Was not sure whether Tokyo would be a bike friendly city. Decided to find out. What a surprise! Tokyo is FANTASTIC for cycling! The trains are so good and parking so expensive that the streets are relatively empty and drivers are super courteous. Oddly, we street to ourselves. Also, the roads are immaculately maintained. They are clean, well-paved, and well-marked. Tokyo is pretty flat. A few hills, but this is not San Francisco (which is also a great biking town). The bikes are excellent. Miracle has a nice arrangement with Tokyo bikes for very nice, seemingly new bikes that work perfectly (very often the bikes you ride on day tours are heavy beasts in need of a friendly wrench. These were nice bikes with low end Japanese components, meaning that they ride better than Italian racing bikes did in 1980. Seriously.)Yu was our guide at Miracle. He speaks excellent English from having lived in the US, he is a Tokyo native and loves his city, he knows every side street and keeps you out of traffic. He rides safely, stops often, and does a fine job explaining things. He did a first rate job -- truly one of the best. We took the history tour that covered Hibiya Park, the overrated Imperial Palace, the underrated Old Hongo area, Tokyo University, Old Yanaka area, Ueno Park, Akihabara, and Ginza. Yu knows each of these areas well and gave wonderful history or stories related to each. The trip also included a visit to the Yasukuni shrine. Yu was articulate about the ambiguity of this place and understood the politics of it well. It is a complex topic, but the shrine is a Shinto memorial to 2,466,532 people plus some animals who have died in Japan's wars over the past two centuries. In the shrine's Book of Souls are 1,068 people convicted of war crimes during World War II. Fourteen of these were convicted of Class A war crimes including the brutal rape of Nanjing and other mass atrocities against civilians. It is the virtual enshrinement of these fourteen names that has made The Shrine has become a political symbol of the ultra-right in Japan. Many prime ministers, foreign heads of state, and even the Japanese emperor boycott the Yasukuni shrine for this reason. Personally, I thought it was a fitting memorial for a nation's war dead, but thought that the statue honoring kamikaze warriors was in poor taste and that the military museum on the grounds not only whitewashed atrocities but detracted from commemorating the war dead. That is the duality of Yakasuni). The tour was educational, fun, not too tiring, included an excellent lunch, and attracted a fantastic woman from Malaysia who we became friends with. Super highly recommended. We plan to do the night tour tomorrow."

It was the most memorable solo travel by far. This trip was very special to my heart coz I got the chance to visit Japan (my childhood dream play place) for the first time from a very busy corporate life and multiple business trips. It was made sweeter because I travelled there to celebrate my birthday - turns out international trip has been my preferred birthday ritual 3 years in a row now (AU,SG,JP). :) But there's more - the trip was made even more special as the staff of Tokyo Miracle Bike Tour made an extraordinary effort to celebrate my birthday with them in their humble office which was decorated by a very beautiful Pinatawith bunch of snacks and coke. Glad to have shared that precious moment with Soshi, Han, Lei, and Sarah! Apart from the amazing bike tour routes, the whole experience from end-to-end and ultimately gaining some genuine friends with very vibrant personalities along rocked the experience. It was crazy way beyond! Could not help but cry with much joy and happiness by the time. Never felt incomplete eventhough my family was not with me on my birthday. They made me feel so blessed and welcomed. :)This was also the very reason for being late sharing my review - I really just want to savour the moment and memories by myself (got a bit selfish there! haha). All the Best to the team of Tokyo Miracle Cycling tour and now my Friends - Soshi, Lei, and Han!!! :)Don't be tired touching lives of many travellers through your healthy and heart-warming local tours (The Real Tokyo Experience).

This was a wonderful way to see Tokyo winding our way along the very bike friendly streets and bike paths of Tokyo. As it was a Sunday the city was busy with lots of travellers but this did not impede our tour. This tour is the most difficult of the four tours according to Arki but it was not arduous for us (moderately fit 50 year olds). There were a few small hills around Ropongyi but the climbs were short. Yu and Arki were very friendly, caring and informative. "

We covered some areas you would never find if you were searching by foot.Never felt uneasy with the traffic, cars seam to understand. In all, a great afternoon may even do another tour if time permits on our time in Japan."

Took us for some cool local snacks - even grasshoppers in the older parts of town. It was a long and worthwhile experience and i'd highly recommend it for other travelers especially if they like to bike. Thanks so much Aki for taking care of us and for even helping us afterwards with reservations during the wonderful chat with had about the tour group and the city. Thanks for making it happen!

Wonderful. To start, the bike was wonderful. I cannot believe how great the brand Tokyo bikes is. Just wonderful - in fact, I am thinking of buying one. I especially love they have the extra seats so I did not need to wear my bike pants. Regarding the tour - just fantastic. Akira was my guide. First of all - so easy to find thanks to the wonderful directions (with pictures). Akira\u2019s english was great and I love the stores. I could not have asked for a better experience. The bike ride was really easy - nice and flat and 6 hours went by too fast. I was surprised I got a beautiful lunch Akira ordered for me. Akira even made a few extra stops just for me. I highly recommend this company and Akira in particular. Thanks for a wonderful experience."

The tour group was small ( just me, my husband, and another fellow). I felt safe biking through Tokyo and didn't feel at risk of getting hurt. Most of the ride took place on sidewalks, which is a common practice in Japan. After the tour we returned to the tour's office and had some refreshments and chatted.

I made a last minute booking for a half day tour the day before after plans for something else fell through, and I\u2019m really glad I did.My tour was led by Soshi and he did a great job explaining the various sights and locations we visited. He\u2019s a very friendly and relaxed guy, and was patient with any questions the group had. Biking was pretty damn easy too with no steep hills or super narrow streets. Japan, unlike some other countries, allows bikes on the streets and the sidewalks. But the best thing is that you cover so much more ground on bike than you could ever by walking. And if you ride the subway, you\u2019re just moving from point A to point B while missing everything in-between. Not so if you have a bike. It really felt liked I saw another side of Tokyo far away from the usual tourist spots.Looking back, this was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. It was a lot better than some of the other super crowded tourist traps *cough* Skytree *cough*. I definitely recommend putting this tour in your itinerary. It\u2019s well worth the time and money."

We saw so much of Tokyo and learnt so much history. The route was varied, paths, roads and parks, with some hills to make it interesting. We felt safe at all times, Aki directing us well, making us confident. Either a half or full day ride is a wonderful way to see the city. The team was also very hospitable, supplying a lovely bento box lunch and afternoon snack on our return. The day exceeded our expectations. Kerrie and Wayne , from Newcastle, Australia"

We did enjoy the historical explanation of Nihombashi Bridge (which in Japan is ground zero for all road distance measurements). The other highlights were the Sumo wrestling stadium and the cherry blossoms near the Imperial Place. Although it was rainy, Soshi supplied excellent rain gear. The rain did not affect the quality of the tour. We got a real sense of Tokyo through the bike tour. We strongly recommend the tour rain or shine."

Tokyo is one of the largest, busiest cities in the world, but even in the heart of the city, never once did I feel in any danger on the roads. The Japanese respect cyclist. The bikes provided by Tokyo Miracle Cycling Tour are very good quality and well maintained. The staff and guides are very enthusiastic and knowledgeable."

Really easy to book online, and they send reminders and confirmations including exact directions on how to find the office. Our tour guide was Aki, and he was the nicest guy! Excellent English and generally really enthusiastic about teaching us about the history and traditions of Japan. The bike ride itself was easy - flat riding. We felt very safe - just follow the guides hand directions! Most of the cycling is on the footpath. There is some on-road cycling, but the drivers in Japan are respectful of cyclist, and will give way if needed. We stopped frequently to chat about the various sites and stopped to have a drink and bought yum fried tofu snacks. Cycling through Ginza was amazing - you get a different perspective on a bike as compared with walking. I highly recommend doing a tour with these guys!!!"

The taxi driver dropped me off in the wrong location, a fair way from the office so I called and Soshi happily came and met me. I'm pleased he did as I would not have found it from where I was without data on my phone to help with directions. A bike was all set up for me and waiting on my arrival. I was extraordinarily lucky to be the only one on the tour so it was completely personalized. We rode 16 km, covered many different districts and saw a huge variety of sights. From the sumo stadium and museum to the beautiful Imperial gardens. This is definitely the best thing I've done in Tokyo in the last 5 days and will leave a long lasting impression. As much for the actual tour as for the fact that Soshi was just so kind and lovely the whole way and provided excellent hand signals to give direction from ahead. He knew I really wanted to spend more time in the imperial gardens and so our tour was extended by about an extra 45 mins. A totally wonderful experience. Soshi and co. offer a not to be missed cycling opportunity. Thank you Soshi, I hope your business achieves much success. You deserve to be highly prosperous. Liz"

It was an excellent way to orientate ourselves in this huge city and put into context all the places that we had been to already via the subway! The tour showed extreme contrasts of of Tokyo, big loud and colorful, versus small delicate and traditional streets."

Very well organised business. Easy booking online, same day responce via email. Soshi our guide was fun and friendly, very attentive and patient (I change bikes 3 times before getting the right fit) and took the tour at our own pace (bit slow because we are a bit slow!). Best to do the tour on a weekend because there are fewer cars and pedestrians."

We booked online at 12pm, by 1:30pm we were at MCT and on our way to explore Tokyo. Soshi was our guide and he was amazing. He had so many cool and interesting things to share with us about Tokyo. We saw things we would simply never know to see on our own, things only locals know. Soshi was also very accomodating to our interests and quickly started sharing information about Tokyo that we would like to know. In 3 short hours we travelled to all the key areas of the city and got to know our way around Tokyo quickly. We left knowing exactly what places in Tokyo we wanted to explore more of on our own and those that we now didn't need to see. We even got some great further recommendations.Most importantly, we were completely at ease the entire time, we went at a comfortable pace and crossed all of those extremely busy intersections with no concerns, thanks to Soshi. We knew we were in safe hands.It was definitely the best way to get to know Tokyo and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting this awesome city.Thanks MCT!"

We did the half-day afternoon tour, having traveled 14 hours and arrived at Tokyo at 6.00am that morning; it was a great way to help adjust to the jet lag.We cycled with our 5 and 8 year old children, and as they were a bit tired and are not strong cyclists they used the trailers which were perfect. There was another family on the trip with a 4 and 7 year old and all the kids had a blast. The trip lasts about 3.5 hours and according to my Garmin it was just under 20k. The cycling isn\u2019t fast or strenuous, you stop often at traffic lights and to see things.If you are expecting a high intensity cycle or a huge amount of info on Tokyo you will probably be disappointed, but if you want a gentle cycle and to pick up a few bits and pieces of information then you will be happy.We would highly recommend and it is a great activity to do with young children."

Most of the group were afraid about riding a bike in such a metropolis. However, it was impressive how respectful we were treated by pedestrians as well as Car and Bus drivers. We saw a lot during this bike tour. A lot you would never be able to see during a Bus Tour or exploring the city as a walker. Aki our Guide was \"the boss\", very knowledgeable and entertaining with a good sense of humor. We had a Bentobox for lunch which we got to eat open-air in the park, just below the Cherry Trees. Amazing.Summarized, this trip was just perfect for our group who had very little time to explore the city."

The office was easy to find for me as the location was correct in google maps.The Tokyo Bike bikes provided were modern and in good working order \u2013 you are also provided with a helmet, comfy seat pad, a little handlebar bag for your small items and a bottle of water. Aki spoke good English and was very knowledgeable and informative about Tokyo and Tokyo\u2019s history, he was clearly passionate about the subject. He was friendly but also polite and professional and accommodating i.e. offering to take photographs etc.The actual route itself was about 20km and mainly on quiet roads, extremely quiet lovely back roads and on the pavement where roads were busier. Cycling in Tokyo felt very safe and Aki was considerate and a good \u2018bike guide\u2019 with his speed and the way he signalled direction and stopping etc. The route was interesting and varied and took in a surprising amount of Tokyo. Great as an overview of the area if you wanted to come back and explore more but also in-depth enough to feel you saw the best sights in the area if you are low on time. The included lunch was a great \u2018authentic\u2019 tasty lunch, and we stopped off for a snack in the morning as well. Overall a fantastic experience and a lovely day out. If I go back to Tokyo I would def sign up or one of the other tours (like the look of the waterfront one)."

Soshi was fun and informative and a great host.If there is any room for improvement I would recommend having some time to stop for a longer time in more areas and get more detailed information at these stops (perhaps also some time for a drink or a quick walk in the shops). The only real stop that we had was at the sumo stadium.Would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to see Tokyo from a different perspective."

We took the advice of another reviewer and took the bike tour on our first full free day in Tokyo. As expected, we covered a lot of ground, were able to orient ourselves in the city and get an idea about where we wanted to explore.We took the Historic Tokyo tour - 6 hours, maybe 24 kilometres - I think this tour may be the shortest of the day tours. It was just right for us, but next time we would take one of the other tours. Yes, we will be happy to go back next time we're in Tokyo.Soshi was the best tour leader - spoke great English, was interested in all his customers and very informative about the sights we were passing. We learnt a lot about Japan on this day and it came in very handy for the rest of our trip. We learned the approved routines for purification, how to pray at the temple, all about \"maid cafes\" - though we didn't visit one, tasted some local delicacies, the differences between various noodle varieties, plus a potted history of Tokyo.The bikes were excellent - the easiest gear changes I've encountered on a pushbike. The pace was easy enough - despite I don't know how many million people, the traffic in Tokyo never seems heavy, and we rode down side alleys most of the time. I was amazed how much ground we covered.My advice, apart from telling you to get on one of these tours, is to start early. We dawdled a little leaving our hotel and only arrived at Shimbashi station at 9.30, by which time we should have been at the office. It's at least 10 minutes walk to the Miracle bike tour office, which we covered in 15 minutes as we didn't know where we were going. When we arrived the tour had already left, but was stopped a couple of hundred yards up the road while we got fitted out and caught up. Thanks goodness for mobile phones, but would have been better if we'd been on time. The office isn't easy to find. Make sure you take careful note of the directions on the web site. We weren't able to print them so I wrote out stuff like McDonalds, turn left, locomotive, keep walking along the railway, red Shinto gates, turn left at JRA horseracing sign. And we made it. Miracle! Well worth the effort. This was a top day"

You get a commentary and/or a pitstop whenever a point of interest comes along.Thank you so much, Akira! I had a wonderful experience! See you again next time in Tokyo!"

But, this is the absolute best, where the leader (Aki) is polite, respectful, hardworking and of high EQ. Even when in 1 of our visits, where there was a group of 17 and where a bike wheel of a guest got punctured, Aki relentlessly and efficiently changed wheels within 7-8 minutes to allow journey to go on.Aki scratched his fingers when mending the wheels per above journry, though Aki never thought about his bleeding finger and kept mending! He just wanna make sure all tourists have a great time! That was a great incredible service attitude and incredible. But, also incredible was that not many at all of the tour members felt anything about Ali's bleeding finger either! At that point, I realised that I have aged and the world has really changed. Our next day's biking with Aki met us with a nice normal family if 4 from Oz. Everyone was nice and helped Aki along. It was also another great trip and a great compassionate trip!Japan is an incredible county with polite people and Miracle Biking is a great replica of the politeness and nicety of what Japan is about!Sue"

Our guide Aki was excellent, patient (even though we had a 7 year old kid in our group of 17, which should not be forgotten), we had to wait a bit but mostly at the traffic lights so the others could catch up. We got to see some great places in Tokyo, some I would never have gone too. We also had lunch in the park which was a super cool Bento Box, which was catered for due to taste as I did not eat fish and my Fianc\u00e9e did not eat meat nor fish. We also experienced the NYE procession at the temple and were told all about Japanese offerings and wishes which was really nice on the day. Highlight for sure is the grave of the Ronin warriors, amazing story and to see the graves of the Ronin was surly my highlight of the day. Please Note this cycle is 15 miles long and you may get a 'numb bum' if not used to cycling. Only a couple of hills but be prepared clothing wise as a few on the tour didn't come prepared i.e. no gloves so didn't enjoy it on a cold day."

We searched and found Tokyo Miracle Cycle Tour and they said they would ride rain or shine. We put in an inquiry for a tour at 9 am the next day and within a half hour, we were booked! The next morning, Sashi was patient when we arrived just on time and then had rain clothes available for all of us.We then went on a tour with my husband, me, and one other person and Sashi was very flexible with taking pictures or stopping in somewhere a little longer (the other guy wanted to buy a gift for his kids so we stopped in a gift store and Sashi even carried them for him in his backpack). We saw a very nice assortment of neighborhoods in areas in Tokyo that I don't think we would have seen as tour buses or on large tours. He was interesting and the tour moved at a great pace. When we got back, he offered us coffee and tea and a sweet and directions. The only thing I would recommend is that when giving directions he ask if tourists have the JR Pass as the directions provided using the subway were actually more challenging and substantially longer (and we got painfully lost) than if we had just used our JR pass on the Yamanote line, but we were too new at the time to Tokyo to realize it. But obviously this has nothing to do with the tour itself and he was great."

We enjoyed this tour immensely (not only because of the great personalities behind it but) after exploring Tokyo by ourselves for a couple of days using the train where it was obviously hard to appreciate the city travelling to and from our destination. It was great being able to experience the many little back streets and local stores along the way (that you wouldn't normally know about or be able to access unless on a bike or on foot). A bike tour in Tokyo is a must to really experience the city. Miracle tours has a small number of guides (running a simple business) who are obviously passionate about great customer service and making sure you have a great time exploring Tokyo. I wish we'd done it earlier! Live and learn.. Please enjoy :)PS. They report that us tourists often book and don't turn up!!!

The tour guide is Akira. he is very friendly and considerate , although his English need improvement, I can understand what he trying to say. It is safe to travel by bicycle in Tokyo because you are allowed to cycle on the pedestrians. We went to Skytree, Asakusa, Senso-ji, Ginza, Palace Garden, Nihonbashi etc. We had lunch in an authentic Japanese restaurant. He explained to me the dishes and teach me how to eat that grilled fish. He also said this cycling tour is quite new in Tokyo.He showed me a lot of local places in Tokyo where not many tourists will go and he explained really well about the intricate relationship between Buddhism and Shintoism in Japan.We have a great time, the terrain is quite flat and it's quite cool in November so I didn't sweat much.It's so good that I end up joining the Tokyo Night tour as well, it's an unforgettable experience and we build a true friendship.

The young man I spoke with was very welcoming and in very short order the tour was booked. Note: the directions to the office on the Internet are excellent- I had no trouble finding it. My guide for the day was Akira (Aki for short) and as it turns out I was the only one booked for the day. So, I had my own personal guide on a 6 hour tour of Central Tokyo. The bike was an 8 speed road bike in excellent condition. We covered a lot of ground about 23 km to be precise. Aki telling me all about the places we visited and answering any questions I had. The tour included lunch in a terrific Japanese restaurant that I never would have found in a million years of looking. The food was excellent.

Aki is a lovely young chap, full of energy and always smiling. Lei is also very nice, full of smiles and always eager to help. Access to the meeting point was easy, following the directions provided by the company. Our group was around 14 people and we all had good quality and well maintained bikes. The tour itself was really nice, with easy cycling to discover some beautiful landmarks of Tokyo. Lunch was included in the price, at a small restaurant and it was delicious!What I'm most happy with is the extra effort that Aki and Lei went through to return some traditional Japanese biscuits (ningyo yakis) that I had bought along the way during the tour but which I forgot to take with me at the end. Much to my surprise and appreciation, Aki cycled all the way to my hotel to return the biscuits! I would totally recommend the tour to anyone who has 6 hours to kill in Tokyo!!"

The path took us to the heart of old Tokyo visited Yoyogi Park, Shinto and and Buddhist temples, the restaurante for our meal break was impressive, Gonpachi, (This is a restaurant that is visited but many actors, entertainers and political figures alike. Ranging from Silvester Stallone to Aerosmith. This establishment is the base for Tarentinos film Kill Bill in its design. The route can bi just a slight bit tasking at times if your out of shape or havent used a bike for a long time like I have.

Luckily the folks at Tokyo Miracle Cycling Tour had space on their \"Afternoon Tour,\" roughly 10 miles and 3 hours through highlights of central Tokyo. We rode across river bridges, checked out the Ginza, passed through the sumo wrestling neighborhood, and rode most of the way around the Imperial Palace. Soshi was a first-rate guide, friendly and funny with excellent guiding skills. The route takes you up on sidewalks (legal in Tokyo) and down some one-way streets the (seemingly) wrong way. The physical requirements of the ride are easy, the route is flat and the pace modest with lots of stops for pics and sightseeing. A great intro to Tokyo.

Through the entire six hour ride he vigilantly watched out for our safety. We made many stops--each one was a fabulous tidbit of Tokyo's past. Aki--whose English was very good--handled the bilingual group with ease. Our Bento Box lunch was tasty and enough calories to fuel our return trip.

I kept my plans loose for the trip because I did not know what to expect and did not know if I would enjoy one region of Japan more than another. When I first arrived to Japan I was intimidated to be in a foreign country (I am from California). On my second day I decided I needed some guidance and searched for Tokyo tours. Tokyo Miracle Cycle Tours popped up and I was intrigued by the reviews. I also love biking around new cities because I believe it is the best way to experience a city or place in an efficient manner. I requested for an availability for a bike tour that day through their website and they responded promptly with an afternoon tour and they reserved a spot for me. The bike tour was one of the best decisions I made on my trip! The tour was about 3 to 4 hours. We covered a lot of ground during that time from the Imperial Palace to Sumida river. If I tried to do the same tour on foot by myself it would of taken me two days and that would be without the convenience of an English speaking tour guide. Soshi was the tour guide for the trip. He always kept safety the priority of our group and I never felt nervous biking around the busy streets of Tokyo behind him. He was also very insightful and I was able to learn a lot about the sights we were seeing. Through my conversations with him learned a lot about Japanese culture and Japanese people. I had a great time on the bike tour and bonded with the people I experienced it with. I had a fun time with Soshi and consider him a friend. The biking tour was a great way to experience Tokyo.

Tokyo Miracle Cycling Tour provided a wonderful tour around Tokyo with incredibly friendly staff and tour guides.A couple of words of warning however. First, the iPhone simply could not work out where this place was - either with the built in Maps or Google Maps. Both put us about 10 minutes away - but luckily they told us to stay where we were and came and found us. So just double check the location against the street address before you start walking from the train station.Second is that these bikes are more road style than tour style - you aren't sitting straight up like a townie but leaning over the handle bars. Makes for an easier ride up the hills (bridges) but isn't as comfortable a ride."

Recommend that you do this tour early in visit to Tokyo as our guide shared lots of useful advice on where to go and what to see.Couldn't have asked for anything better"

No hills and easy to maneuver thru the city. Aki was easy to talk to and a very personable and knowledgable tour guide.

            "review": "Great way to tour the city!. We emailed Miracle Bike tours the morning of the day we wanted to tour. I would suggest checking ahead, I feel like we got really lucky they had availability for the half-day afternoon tour. We got to the bike shop about 20 mins ahead of schedule, plenty of time to fill out simple paperwork and talk briefly about the tour. Our guide was Soshi, the owner of the company. His English was phenomenal and he was very conversational. The third person on our tour ended up not showing, so my wife and I got a private tour with Soshi! He explained the route he planned and asked us if there was anything in particular we have already seen or are especially interested in seeing. The tour was extremely accommodating. The tour included bottled water, small snack afterwards, helmet, bike and even extra padding for the seat. We set off on the tour after a short tutorial and were biking through the Tokyo streets with ease. Soshi was great at leading the way...constantly keeping our safety in mind, checking on us and traffic around us. Like other reviews said, there are frequent stops and my wife and I (both active 28 year olds) never once felt tired or that we couldn't keep up. The stops were planned in front of landmarks and doubled as rest and photo ops. Per our request, we stopped for some Amazake and mochi along the way.Overall, this was our best memory of Tokyo and if we ever make it back we plan to take the other tours Miracle Cycling tours offers! Soshi even emailed us a photo he took for us after the tour.Two thumbs way up for this activity/attraction/tour of Tokyo, I HIGHLY recommend."

From the confirmation email, to the snacks and drink at the end of the tour, it was a truly excellent experience. I did the Tokyo Half Day Tour in the morning (Ginza, Nihonbashi bridge, Old Ningyocho area, Ryogoku Sumo stadium, Akihabara, Imperial palace, Tokyo station, Hibiya park). The bikes were great quality and very easy to ride and change gears (even for an unfit, uncoordinated, middle-aged and infrequent cyclist like myself) and the gel seat and lovely cold bottle of water in the bottle holder was very much appreciated. Soshi, the owner of the business, was my guide and made sure that the tour was the best experience it could be; clear directions/hand signals in traffic; plenty of stops as desired for photos, attractions, food-drink, bathroom; personalising my tour (by taking me to a shrine for mothers and babies - perfect for a midwife); answering loads of questions and providing great information. Really great value for money and definitely a highlight of my trip. My only regret is that I didn't have time for a longer tour! Very highly recommended."

You get a great overview and feel of the different districts of the city.Took a half day tour on a Sunday afternoon, which I enjoyed a lot, since there was less traffic and some of the main streets were blocked for pedestrians which gave a nice calm to this bustling city!When I find something really worth recommending I really want to tell you why and this is what I enjoyed about my experience with Miracle Cycling Tours:1. Soshi (the owner) was the best of guides: experienced, attentive, flexible, focused, fun!Before coming I was wondering about the tempo, will it be too tough, how will they keep the group together, will it be stressful etc. But Soshi took all details for each participant (middle-aged, teens) into account and put together a great tour for all of us, giving us photo stops and interesting details about the city along the way!2. Soshi was very aware about security, from the bikes themselves (including you could add on a \"cusioned\"-seat for extra comfort :) to giving very distinct signals when on the road, to making sure we had enough water breaks and even provided water for us during and after the tour.3. Just having the possibility of covering so much more ground on a bike compared to walking around. We could see so much more of spectacular Tokyo than I would have on my own. Since I was here in the beginning av August with heat waves of >34\u00b4C and >70 in humidity, being on a bike was the best of ways to catch a cool breeze. Afterwards we sat down and looked at the map so we could see where we had been and get help with directions for the parts I wanted to re-visit.4. On the website, Soshi has included a visual \"How-to-find-their-office\"-guide and I just want to say that it was accurate. I very much appreciate when what is presented on the site is congruent to the service and experience you get. I had so much fun on my first tour that I returned for a second tour - an Evening Tour a couple of days later. If I come back, I'll do another bike tour, for sure. I can highly recommend this activity and Soshi and his team especially!!"

So, if you want a really good looking and charming tour guide, you should probably request him. LOLOn a more serious note, Akira really made this tour a history lesson that I enjoyed; and I thought I hated history. He was able to help me make connections with Japanese culture that I never even knew I had. For example, if you've ever watched \"Spirited Away\" or \"Princess Mononoke,\" Akira bridged the gap for me on how those movies actually proved to be ingenuous simplified versions of Ancient Japanese customs. He also knows what's up when it comes to Japan do's and don'ts, so you'll be able to fit right with him despite being a tourist.Would go again, would request Akira, especially if I was looking to pick up women ;)..."

The directions on the website were very helpful for locating the bike store. I was welcomed by two very pleasant and helpful people and equipped with a bike, gel seat, helmet, and bottle of water. We then headed off for a quick practice to familiarize me with the bike (which was very light, comfortable, and easy to ride) and then cycled through Ginza, old Ningyocho town, Ryogoku to see the sumo wrestling museum, a shrine where expectant mothers were praying for a good birth and new mothers giving thanks for their babies (perfect for a midwife), the colourful and busy electronic stores of Akihabara, and the beautiful Imperial palace and Tokyo station. The pace of the tour was just right with great directions and plenty of photo stops. After the tour I was kindly provided with a nice cold drink and snack and advised how to get back to my accommodation. It was a great way to see the sights, get a sense of the layout of the area, and find out more about Japan (as I had an excellent tour guide with great English). I highly recommend this tour and thought it was extremely good value for money."

Aki, our guide, was able to answer our questions well. I also noticed the good relationship they (guide) have with the folks you meet during the stops. The tour started and ended on schedule so it's safe to plan more visits after this tour. As stated on the website, the bay side tour is a bit more challenging: uphill climbs for the bridges connecting the islands, and the final climb leading to the Tokyo Tower. I find the challenging route and the scenery very enjoyable. Highly recommended!"

Well, in reality, \"miracle\" is an extreme understatement of how amazing this trip was. Not only was this tour a miracle, but it also was a life experience. Embark on this trip, and witness Tokyo from a perspective you will never be able to forget. Even though we only took the half-day trip, I'm sure that it was as fun and fulfilling as the full trip. Speaking of miracles, our group also got a real miracle. The weather was perfect, with the rain stopping right before the trip started. The clouds provided cover from the harsh summer sun, and the breeze cooled us down during the trip. It rained a little, but only slightly. The sun started to show itself just as we entered Hibiya Park, the end of our tour. The weather was a Miracle indeed. Part of me still wishes that I am still sitting on the chair of the red bicycle, cruising through the streets of Tokyo. The one thing, (more like people), that makes \"Miracle\" Cycling more than just a word is the friendly staff and tour guides. They possess expert knowledge of the city, while still being like a best friend. I would like to express my great thanks to Soshi and the rest of the crew, who make this Miracle far more than just a miracle."

We also saw Ginza, The Sumo stadium, the Imperial Palace and visited small shops for biscuits and non-alcoholic sake. The cycling felt safe and everywhere we went, Soshi highlighted points of interest. Very professional.Tip: if you have time before or after the cycling, eat in the basement foodcourt of the Shiodome City building.

The bike shop is pretty central and the team delivers a nice \u201chow to find us\u201d with good pictures and perfect description.Once we arrived the team explains quickly the route we were taking and after that we did the bike check. The bikes are cool retro-style city bikes and everything worked well. We started the tour (10 participants) with our three tour guides and they made sure that we don\u2019t get lost or split in the city. Although Tokyo is one of the largest metropoles in the world, the traffic was quiet and not comparable to cities as Bangkok, Saigon or New York, where as a biker you\u2019re exploit to a bunch of idiots in cars and buses.However, the tour was good. The speed could have been bit higher but I guess for most of the participants it was good. What we found good is that you see a lot of places you would probably not see on our own. Nice residential areas and temples, but also small areas full of caf\u00e9s and restaurants. We had our lunch break at a nice Japanese restaurant where we got serve sashimi, tempura, miso soup and some other Japanese specialties. Lunch was included as well as some water during the tour.English skills of the tourguides are good and far better than many other Japanese tourguides we met. All of them were very friendly and they like their job, which in turn gives the tour a better quality.The only two things which could be improved are:- More information should be delivered during cycling. We were mostly in front and of course did not here what people discussed in the back and they way round. I think an idea to solve this would be the implementation of an one-ear headset were each tourguide can talk and everybody can hear the same. At least as an option for the people who want to get more information (we must admit that our expectations are probably much higher than the average).- Although we got a quick overview where we went, it was very hard for us to follow up. It would be great if one of the tam would record the track via GPS and upload the route to the website, maybe also with the indication of our stops. That makes it more simple to follow up and maybe visit some places on the own sometimes later."

This tour is the perfect solution. We could not believe, as novice cyclists, that we were pedaling through the crowded streets of Ginza or Tokyo Station or Akihabara. But all we had to do was to follow Soshi's hand signals. We got to see quiet neighborhoods, rode along the river, dashed through the Imperial Palace gardens and Hibiya park. All throughout, Soshi was very safety conscious and was well prepared to take care of us with helmets, rain gear, and water. The bikes were light, and rode easily over the flat terrain.We stopped for Japanese snacks that we wouldn't have known what to look for or where to find them - fish-shaped pastry filled with sweet bean paste and sweet rice wine drink. We went through an old-fashioned arcade parlor in Akihabara and spotted as sumo on a bicycle outside the stadium. When we got back to NY, Soshi sent a photo he took of us and asked how his katsu-don dinner recommendation was (great!) Don't expect an information-laden history lesson on this tour as you would get in Beijing or Florence. But if you want something a little different that lets you see a lot in a short amount of time - this is the tour!"

We went on the Old City tour but there was plenty of \"new city\" to pass through as well. I finally visited Todai (Tokyo University, one of the best in the world and the top in Japan). Asked Soshi to let us stop for photo-op as this will be my only chance of being \"in Todai\". Hahaha.For those worried about cycling in a city, Tokyo is virtually flat and the cycling is done on the pavement which are very wide and shared only with pedestrians. We went at a comfortable pace and Soshi was always looking out for us to make sure we were following and safe.The best part for us foodies were the little shops that sold snacks. How we are still talking about the croquettes we ate with Soshi. And the cake shop that I asked Soshi to stop at in Yanaka, yummy x 3. It was so pretty we just had to have a break. Loved snake alley (no live snakes), and other little gems. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

We chose the Sunday morning 3 hour ride which covered approximately 16km's through the city. There was time to stop for a snack, a sip of (non-alcoholic) sake and plenty of photo opportunities. The ride was flat and suitable for anyone. The route taken was safe and avoided heavy traffic areas. To top of the morning Soshi has a great sense of humour which made the ride more fun with his little quips along the way."

Most of the cycling was on pavements or very quiet streets, however we did cycle along some roads with traffic. I am usually quite a nervous cyclist in traffic but felt quite safe with Aki and Tokyo drivers are very considerate to cyclists which they are not at home. We had a delicious lunch and a ferry ride back to the Tokyo Tower area. All in all excellent."

On tour day, there was potential rain in the forecast; however, Soshi reassured us that most likely there would be no rain during the tour. We are glad we did not cancel! We had an amazing 3 hour tour of the city as we stopped by each historical landmarks that was offered in the tour to embrace the beauty and information background lesson taught by Soshi. In addition, he took us through these various alley ways that contained local shops, bakeries and eateries which the typical tourist will not know. The best way to get a feel good of Tokyo is a bike tour in my opinion. You will not be disappointed! By the way, the weather ended up being absolutely amazing! Thanks again Soshi!"

In such a busy city, safety is clearly of paramount importance but I never felt in any danger with our two daughters, aged 11 and 9.The pace was slow (due in part to another couple on the tour who hadn't been acquainted with a bike in the last 30 years!) So we could have gone faster but the easy pace allowed us to take in our surroundings. The guide, Sochi, was very knowledgeable about his city.I'm a big fan of using a bike to get to know a city....Tokyo is so big you can't see it all on foot and if you use the Metro you miss out on seeing lots of things....so book yourself on one of these trips would be my recommendation!"

There is not as much traffic as you may think and the guide does a great job at signaling and directing you. It is much easier riding in Tokyo than a city like San Francisco.Three of us joined an afternoon half-day tour with Akira. Two of us commute by bicycle regularly in San Francisco, CA and the other in Sao Palo, Brazil. I had a slight concern that we would be moving at a slow pace, but our guide quickly assessed our skill level appropriately. We were soon jamming down Tokyo streets, cutting through alleys, and swiftly crossing major intersections with ease and confidence. It was so much fun!We rode a little over 12 miles in a little over 3 hours. We saw thebig sights but also rolled through small neighborhoods where we snacked on tasty Japanese Croquettes by the road side. We were going at a good pace, so our guide was able to take us on a detour to check out the Shrine Festival, which was very interesting to observe. Riding through quite Tokyo side streets is a lot of fun and bombing down the major streets is exhilarating.The bikes were very well maintained and performed pretty well. They are flat bar vintage styled 8 speed bikes. You will not hit many hills, so you won't be gear changing much, but gear shifting is smooth and the bikes ride well overall. Seeing Tokyo by bicycle really connects you to the city and I would highly recommend this outfit for all skill levels."

We saw all the major sites and he suggested good places for us to go afterwards and an awesome Ramen place round the corner from their offices to eat our lunch. I wish we had done the full day tour! The tour was everything we could have wanted and Aki was very sweet taking photos of us on our camera at some beautiful cherry blossom sights. When the tour ended we were a bit wet (it had drizzled nonstop the whole morning!) so Aki made us tea and let us dry off at the office, he was so friendly and we chatted about music for quite a while!

Only one challenging hill and a need to be attentive while flowing with street traffic. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom which made everything even more magical. We made stops at Sengakuji, Happoen, Mejijingu, and Zojoji, wove our way all through so many districts including Shibuya, Harajuku, and Roppongi. Lunch was at a delicious, tiny restaurant in Sibuya where we feasted on cold soba noodles and tuna with veggies and rice. Aki modified our tour slightly since it was only the two of us to ensure we saw tons and tons of blossoms (thank you!!!!).We would definitely take another tour in the future! This is a must do for everyone who enjoys biking :-)!!"

In fact, six days all in all, which includes three days in Tokyo.Stumbled upon Miracle Cycling tours on my Google search. In fact, it is on the top of my search, and boy!, it was worth a shot.Registering for the Historical Tour is very easy, and the staff are very helpful. Getting to their office is also very easy because of the updated pictures and walkways posted on their website.Nori became our tour guide for the day, and in the group are two of my friends and three others from Adelaide, Australia. Nori is very knowledgeable on every part of the tour and even took us to his favorite shop in Asakusa. He even treated us with a very good bento box lunch picnic. Even though lunch is part of the package, the bento box seems to be carefully purchased. Not for the sake of getting it somewhere else. Nori is also open to questions not related to the cycle tour, such as where to go to Tokyo at night or the best places to shop for bargain items. What amazed me the most is that Nori take his work with so much pride and enthusiasm. He seemed to be in to biking, always smiling, eager to learn the culture of other countries, and showed us what Japanese hospitality is all about.The bikes from Miracle Cycling are also in very good condition and very lightweight, which make biking very easy.I will do this again if I get a chance to go back to Tokyo. I highly recommend the all-day bike tour especially if you want to cover a lot of ground in a very short time. It may seem very tiring since it's all day, but Nori did a fantastic job of keeping a very mild pace and ensuring that everyone's safe. Thank you very much Nori and the rest of Miracle Cycling Tour for an amazing experience. Thank you also for the photos you sent via email. I wish you well and more success in the future. I am looking forward to book another tour with you again.PS. To Debbie, John, and Crystal, we wish you safe travels on your next adventure."

The hybrid bikes were excellent and it was good to wear helmets. We loved the picnic lunch (bento boxes) under the cherry blossom. Pace at times was fast requiring concentration - we rode a mixture of highway and pavements. The guides were knowledgeable and keen to share and interact with the group. Refreshments back at base at the end were much appreciated. A great introduction to the city!"

We were a family of 7 (two teens, two mid-twenties, and three over 50), and we had the half-day morning tour to ourselves. Our guides were Akira and Yuki. Despite our group essentially being newbies to biking (most of us not having time in a bike since elementary), Aki and Yuki were very patient and were able to teach us enough to get through Tokyo's busy streets. We expected to ride around a special bike path for the tour, but instead got a taste of riding through the heart of the city. Cycling through main roads, sidewalks, crossing busy intersections... That's just a little bit of what's in store. During the ride, our guides would talk about where we were, and any interesting points about the area. We rode through Ginza, Nihonbashi bridge, Ryokoggu, and Akihabara (we skipped Imperial Palace because we had a 2 o'clock). Again, all of us in the group don't bike back home, let alone bike around a busy city. But the Bike Tour was definitely the most fun and most memorable thing we've done so far. I cannot stress how grateful we are to Aki and Yuki being our guides. I highly recommend the Tokyo Miracle Cycling Tour for any group who is interested in some adventure. Admittedly, you'd need to be able to handle a bicycle, but as long as you can maintain your balance, and remember to brake, you will enjoy your time."

Whilst other options such as metro, foot and taxi can be used, seeing Tokyo on a bike seems now the only way to do it.We saw more than I expected to see and riding on the roads was not a problem - unlike in the UK the drivers show good respect for all other road users.The guides, Nori and Rei, were informative and very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Lunch arrangements were agreed as a group and the bento box was excellent.The area covered was all flat so the 24km distance of the tour is actually easier on a bike than on foot. One comment I would make - that is NO criticism at all of the tour - is that it's not a trip I'd do with children under the age of 15 or 16; whilst the roads were okay, it did require me to have my wits about me on occasion (and I ride lots in the UK).Helmets were also supplied and the bikes were Tokyo Bikes (tokyobike.com) ... Obviously! Bikes were well services and clean."

I booked a half-day trip for my parents and myself on a Saturday morning, and it was unanimously agreed to be the best time we had in Tokyo! Thank you Sochi-san (our guide)! Sochi was warm, knowledgeable, personable, attentive and convivial. A gem of a guide!Firstly, we got lost (stupidly) trying to find our way to the location on foot. Sochi gave us a ring to check on us when we were late, and offered to walk us from the subway station. It was very kind of him, and we were grateful for the clear and patient walking directions he gave over the phone. Secondly, when I explained that my parents spoke no English and were illiterate, and that I would have to translate whatever he said as we went along, he was very understanding and clearly tailored the pace and content of his tour to whatever my parents were interested in. Finally, when he realised that my mother was taking pictures of the flowers along the way and was lamenting about not being able to catch any cherry blossoms (we were about a month too early for that), he very sweetly went out of the way to bring us to a temple where there were plum blossoms in bloom, and also to a lone blooming cherry blossom tree along one of the parks. It was such an unbelievably sweet gesture that I was quite lost for words. My mother was so thrilled and was going about like a child in a sweet shop - it was so lovely! I was also very pleased to get to try some okonomiyaki and takoyaki on his recommendation - my personal favourite Japanese snacks anyway! At the end of the trip, we were again treated to the wonderful Japanese hospitality as he kept us fed and warm with tea, coffee, rice crackers, and printed a map of some recommended lunch places, as he left us to go about our day. I was very humbled by the kindness, generosity, and warmth exhibited by Sochi, and my parents for days after, were still going on about it - Japanese hospitality at its best! We were absolutely spoilt rotten, and we're so grateful! Thank you for showing us the old town and so much more. Cheers Alexis "

My day started on a wet and cold February morning and it's not surprising that I was the only customer that came.The staff then kindly asked me if I would like to do a walking tour instead, but I opted for the cycling tour as it was only drizzling at the time.So they gave me a nice bike with leather seats and grips, and provided me with a cool looking rain gear to start off the tour.The tour I've chosen was the tokyo old downtown tour, and my guide, Nori, was excellent. He was kind, friendly and knowledgable. He always tries his best to answer all of my questions and gives me information about the places we visited. Also, he gave me lots of suggestions for the rest of my tokyo trip.I have mainly chosen this route because I wanted to experience a tour that I can explore tokyo best through cycling. And I was pleasantly satisfied. We went through big and popular areas as well as small historical streets which normally isn't popular while traveling by train/foot. Nori also took me to traditional-style snack shops while exploring the streets. Lunch was also superb as Nori brought me to a local shop where I got to experience what locals eat.So overall, if you want to explore Tokyo in a fun and unique fashion, or if you just love exploring places with your bike at home, then I would totally recommend the bike tours they offer!"

If you are looking for a cycling tour around Tokyo, I strongly recommend this to you guys.I, together with 3 of my friends pick up Tokyo downtown ride. It's an all day course (6 hours). And here is the list of things I like:- Everyone is really friendly and polite, I feel really comfort while I was with them- If your group is the only group on that day, they will allow you to make a request- Their bikes are good, they're in a perfect condition and quite light which help you a lot when you need to ride on it all day long.- I'm not sure if I was mistaken or not, but it seems our guide decide to fix some schedules for us to make us most satisfied. For example, he decide to bring us to several food stall once he knew that we enjoy eating so much.- Their English is good, especially if you compare to other Japanese. They might not be as fluent as native speakers but they tried their best to make sure that we understand everything.- Though I've mentioned above that it's a 6 hours course, but it actually took above 7 hours because we spent quite a lot of time in each stop. And our guide never tried to rush us.Of course it's not a perfect trip but I can guarantee that you guys won't be disappointed with this. Good job!"

It was fast enough that we were able to cover a large area, but with enough stops to allow us to enjoy the fascinating Tokyo scenery. The bike route was easy enough to accomplish, even for us occasional bikers, and gave a cool look at the tempo of everyday life in Tokyo, something very few tours are able to do. Soshi was extremely good about answering any questions we had \u2013 and we had a lot!-- and tended to our small group's needs. He even brought us out of the scheduled tour program to check out the Imperial Palace at our request! We highly recommend this trip to anyone who is looking for a fun and unique way to experience the city. Definitely would book a trip again the next time we are in town!"

Our guides were extremely patient and helpful and took us to a wide variety of sights throughout the area. We saw the mix of modern and traditional throughout the city and learned about traditions, etiquette and culture that we would have never known if we were on our own.The tour took about 6 hours and there are hills and times when you have to weave around pedestrians on the sidewalk. The guides made sure that everyone stays together and that no one is left behind. You stop for lunch midway and then have coffee at the end. It is a great time to talk to the guides and learn more about the city and the culture. Our guides seemed to really enjoy the opportunity to chat with us and learn more about us too."

You have several snacks at different places (the oyster was absolutely amazing) and then you end at a stand up sushi bar - which was just delicious! When in the inside market, Yuki was able to guide me to places where I could take photos which was extremely helpful. It was a terrific experience to be shown around the market by a Tokyo local who could fill me in on what was going on around me.I would highly recommend this tour for anyone who wants to visit the tsukiji fish market. I would not have got as much out of visiting the market if I had gone alone. Thank you Yuki for your terrific tour!"

As a local, Kazu was able to guide us to the best items within the market while also providing background and history to the location. At around 10am, Kazu took us inside the inner market and showed us around the hundreds of stalls, which are filled with highly impressive seafood. After about an hour there, we were taken to the nearby vegetable market, which was surprising as we had no idea it existed within Tsukiji. After this, we had an enjoyable and delicious sushi lunch with Kazu and the rest of the group.

We went to the fish market area in the morning and started with seeing an assembly line making omelets for a number of small stalls. Then we progressed to seeing and tasting a whole array of foods - sea urchins, squid, eel, various mushrooms, shark, tuna slicing, oysters, clams, king crab, candied fruit, etc. before we finally went into the inner sanctum of the fish market. This is allowed only after 10 am when the actual bidding and purchasing of fish has finished. The amount of tuna alone was staggering to comprehend. Outside this area I noticed a building about 9 stories high and asked what that was and was told that was the refrigeration building! Purchasers store their fish in there before distributing it. Then we proceeded to the outer ring of the market where the fruits and vegetables are sold. It was incredible to see such a large variety of produce offered. Then we went for lunch and more touring before finishing at a \"sweets\" place with dessert and tea. Well worth the time and money, especially with our guide, Kato Kazu.The tour is long on walking and one has to be observant when all the little trucks and things are whizzing about in the fish market....time is money......"

It is one of the many many streets in Tokyo that have souvenir shops, food shops, clothing stores, etc., etc., etc. The big, and I mean really big, difference is that this is where the \"commoners\" go to shop. The prices are significantly lower than the more well known tourist shops and the quality is higher. Our guide, Yoko, was better than excellent. She filled us in on the shop's history, explained the various differences in the available selections, introduced us to the proprietor, and made the entire adventure enjoyable and educational. The tempura and yakatori were especially delicious; much better than what we had previously at a high end (expensive) Japanese dinner in the \"better\" part of town. Besides providing insight into the area, Yoko explained the reasons behind Japanese ways of life. Such as why the Japanese walk on the left; because a Shogun made it the law. The sword of the Samurai was placed on the left hip and extended out to the left, when walking on the left the swords of oncoming Samurai would not hit. All in all this tour was very enjoyable and worth the price. Arigato gozaimas."

Glad we chose to go with Japan Wonder Travel because they were professional, met us on time, and provided us an in depth and informative 3-4 hour morning around the inner and outer market of tsukiji. We got to sample green tea, plums and pickles and dried fruits, had 2 giant amazing raw oysters, we paid additionally to try the fresh King crab at the oyster place (very fresh!), watched someone make yummy tamago and enjoyed 2 skewers, and had a lovely sushi lunch at a standing sushi bar which we opted to pay additional for beer and more sushi pieces (try the alphonsino!) Yuko was kind and lovely to be around. She was easy to talk to and also brought us to have two cups of cold sake in which we were able to take home two cedar wood sake cups as souvenirs. We bought dried fruit, fresh green tea and plum on the trip with Yuko. Very filling morning since we sampled so much food we had to start declining to try food because we were getting too full. Yuko was a great photographer too and took many pictures for us. This tour is highly recommended and I would go again and try their different tour options next time!"

Similar to what others have said, this is a fine tour for walking the outer market and seeing the inner market AFTER 10 am both things you can do without a guide. Basically that means you get in with the public after the real party is over. You wont see the whole pre-cut tuna in all their glory moving throughout the inner market after auction, nor will you experience the fanatical pace of activity and buzz you see before 9 am. This was a huge disappointment and the reason we bought this tour. To me, its simply misleading and not worth the ridiculous price of $140 pp. The sushi making was fun and worth the extra price, and our guide Yuriko was terrific. None of this is a reflection on her. The issue is more expectations - don't think you are getting in early or seeing the real buzz of the inner market w this tour. You are just like everyone else in the public, less $700 you paid (for 5) !!"

Noriko was our guide and was very polite, respectful and professional. Before the tour she was great in communicating with us regarding schedule and places to see and was able to fit in everything within reason. She was on-time to our scheduled departure from our hotel. We had 2 young boys with us and she was great in connecting with them too. We had lots of questions about Tokyo and Japan and she was very good at answering them. The price was good for the tour and a very good value. What was unique was this tour was all on foot and not in a van, so we got to see Tokyo on public transportation, which was very easy to use. We would like to return to Tokyo again someday and I will definitely look to hire Noriko and Japan Wonder Travel."

We did two tours, the Tsukiji market tour and the Sunamachi food tour. Both were fantastic. Michiko was our guide both times, and she was a lovely host. Sunamachi is a quaint and fascinating street filled with lovely artisanal speciality shops- we visited a family run tempura store where the tempura has been made by hand by Grandma for the last 40 years, and mom and daughter work in the store too! It was wonderful to see a truly authentic local shopping street. Tsukiji was a delight as well- Michiko wove us in and out of the maze of the inner market with deft expertise in a way we could never have managed on our own. Arigato for a fantastic experience!"

You have a wonderful licensed guide (Hiroko is the best ^^), who is knowledgeable and will do their best to make sure you have a great time. If you go by yourself you'll only see the outer market and not get to experience the inner market, where you get to meet the local vendors, and avoid the short tempered ones, where your awesome guide comes in handy ;)Also the food you eat along the way is super delicious. Be careful of the free wasabi flavoured seaweed they hand out for you to try. Thanks Hiroko for making Tsukiji Market a highlight of our trip :D We had an awesome time with you."

The tour was also great because there were only six people on it so it was easy to walk together and we could all hear and be close to Noriko.

They assigned Yuriko to us and she was excellent! She was punctual, organized and very informative. My teenage son enjoyed her commentary of Japanese life. Highlight of the day was the fish market, which Yuriko helped us navigate through the market. She knows most of the traders there and knew where to bring us around. We loved Asakusa but my hubby didn't really enjoy the Sunamachi snack street, so we asked for Yuriko to bring us to Shibuya instead. She went out of her way to help book our restaurant for dinner.

We lucked out and ended up just having us and Ichi on the tour. We started our tour trying different kinds of Asahi beer. Then we walked over to a small little sake/liquor shop that was run by one of the sake masters of Japan. While there we ended up running into the sake master (he usually isn't there due to his scheduling) and got to taste some delicious sake. We ended up purchasing a bottle that the sake master had brewed himself. From there, Ichi gave us a guided tour of the Senso-ji temple area. Although we had gone to see the temple the day before, this tour was nice cause Ichi was willing to take all the photos of me and my husband that we didn't get the day before. Then he took us to get food at one of his favorite places. Ichi did all the ordering for us after learning the kind of things we were willing to try. I can't remember everything that we had but I do remember eating some beef intestine soup, some fried tofu, chicken skewers and some fried ham. From there we ended up going to a little place for some savory pancakes (okonomiyaki). There are different kinds from different regions and they are made up of what you want to put in them (usually cabbage, onion, egg, seaweed, some kind of meat etc). Ichi walked us back to our subway line and we ended up walking by some Sumo wrestlers who were out eating for the night. We were very pleased with the experience provided by Ichi and Japan Wonder travel and would suggest the tour to everyone!"

There were SO many people shopping in the outer market. It was very difficult to get around. I've lived in Japan for three years and this was one of the most crowded places I've been. Even so, Naoko did a good job of keeping our tour group together. And we were still able to sample all of the products we were promised. If possible, I would recommend taking the tour on a weekday to avoid these crowds.The last stop on the tour was a lovely, quiet, well-air conditioned sushi restaurant.

Whilst you could probably do the outer on your own the inner requires expert knowledge of where to go, how to navigate, which market operators are 'friendly' etc. Our guide Noriko was perfect - excellent English and knowledge of the markets and enables us to cover off a huge amount of the market in a short time (amazing considering we had a 2 year old in our group).

What we found appealing was the fact that this tour covers the Meiji Shrine and Takeshita St. Our favourite part was probably walking through Takeshita St and seeing so many eateries and popular shops while trying to navigate through a sea of people (we went during Golden Week, so everywhere will generally be more crowded due to this national holiday). Visiting Meiji Shrine was great too, very peaceful and zen. It doesn't feel like you are actually in a city full of hustle and bustle.Our host, Yu, was excellent. He was enthusiastic and answered all our questions. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. In addition, at this time we also had a lolita, Ai, guide us along the tour and gave us an insight into the world of lolitas, the lifestyle and fashion.The care they showed us was fantastic. At one point, on the way to Shibuya (walking to the train station) A few of the people in our group couldn't go on anymore due to walking all day the previous day and today and had blisters etc. So a taxi was organised to take to Shibuya instead of us having to take the train. Very convenient!Afterwards they brought us to a kawaii cafe that was Alice In Wonderland themed and we enjoyed some sweets. Visiting Harajuku and Shibuya and wonderful experiences that a visit to Japan would not be complete without. We would like to thank Yu and Ai for their hospitality. We thoroughly enjoyed this one!"

Under his guidance, we explored the inner and outer markets at Tsukiji and sampled many tasty treats. I was the only client with Ichi for the Asakusa Street Food and Local Drink Tour, and he not only made certain I sampled the best beer, sake and food Asakusa had to offer, but he also answered my many questions about religion and customs in Japan. He deferred my questions about sake to the sake master we meet during the tour. All in all, two excellent tours and two memorable experiences!"

There are the wholesale markets (which aren't always very receptive to tourists), the outdoor markets and the fruit and veg markets to explore. Thanks to Ichi and the tour I took I got an insiders view of the world of the Tsukiji market - exploring parts that I would have never found on my own.It is a fascinating place and I cannot do justice to the sights and smells you discover there - I can only encourage that you visit the market when you are in Tokyo and to do so with a tour or guide.Ichi and I spent a terrific 3.5 hours exploring the market and eating on the way. He showed me the fruit stand where 1 mango cost 9000Yen. He guided me through the wholesale area where outsiders are not particularly welcomed. Ichi took me to several merchants with specialties in bonito flakes, sake and green tea - with taste sampling.The highlight was lunch at a sushi bar/lunch place - a few blocks away from the market - fish as fresh as the expensive places within the market but about half the price. The food was sublime. And only locals go there so you had a glimpse of the real Tokyo. I highly recommend this tour. Ichi was informative and very flexible to make sure your interests were part of the itinerary. As a vegetarian, he made sure I had the appropriate food. The only downside was it was pouring rain during the whole time, but Ichi apologised and said he could not control that - if only he could.Highly recommended."

I should probably stipulate that I have never arrived late for a tour. Ever.

From start to finish we were mesmerized by the wonders of the world's largest fish market. Yuko clearly set our expectations and never once were we disappointed. From tastes throughout the market -- the hot tamago yaki on a stick was the perfect start to a cold and rainy day -- to seeing an almost limitless variety of fish, seafood, and seasonal vegetables and fruits, we were transfixed. We had conversations with the vendors who willingly took time out of their busy morning to help us better understand their products and even shared some favorite recipes. The outer market tour was an equal delight as we continued tasting our way through the market and making purchases. Our tour concluded with a terrific lunch at a small, nearby sushi restaurant that was an oasis of calm after being in such a busy market.

We started with a few of the temples on the outskirts of the market and then Noriko-san led us through the byzantine market itself. This tour is quite a bit of walking, so bring your walking shoes! Not to be missed."

Naoko, our guide, was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating, answering any questions that we had and made it a point to conduct the tour from a local's standpoint, including great viewing spots of Tsukiji and eating quality sushi at an affordable price. Thank you Naoko for a wonderful experience and guided tour- it was an experience I would never have gotten on my own and it exceeded my expectations!"

She deftly guided us through the rows of the market, telling us which places were fine with having pictures taken and which not. She answered all the questions we had, and showed us extra sights like temples along the way. We tried Japanese omelet, sake, green tea, oysters, fish cake and sushi along with many other little samples. It was very informative and fun! I highly recommend."

After booking, received confirmation emails with a picture of where to meet. I found it with no problems, and tour commenced on time. Kumie was our group guide for the morning, and she was very easy to talk to and answered our many questions. She certainly knew her way around both the inner market and the outer market. The tastings were good, and we sampled many products that are sold to locals. You are also given choices as to the types of seafood you would like to try, so if there's one you don't care for, you certainly have other options. The tour ended with a lunch at a nice sushi restaurant a block or so outside the outer market area. The sushi was delicious, though it was a \"standing bar\" meaning no seats, and after 3+ hours of walking around, it would have been nice to have a chance to sit and rest. To those considering this tour, yes, you could see many of the sights on your own. But a guide was of great help in identifying many of the Japanese seafood and produce for sale, as well as having someone to tell you about how it all fits into Japanese culture. I'd say the services of a guide were well worth the price, and you will take away a greater understanding of what you've seen. Highly recommended!"

You sure could go there by yourself, but I would not recommend it for a (western) tourist. It really is not a tourist place to stroll around, but more of a business place for wholesalers etc. Yu guided us perfectly through it, exactly knowing how to behave without bothering the working people, knowing the right people where we could stop and talk.I used to work as a chef, so I had some quite specific questions about the foid, processes, roles etc. - they all were answered to my satisfaction. I also liked the view on the whole markets from the parking deck - you sure must know where to go to find that spot!In my opinion, for the outer markets you don't really need a guide. Those stands are very easily to be detected by oneself. However, Yu showed us some interestings shops and a nice temple, too.I would definitely recommend this tour for someone who is interested in the inner markets!"

My daughter was fascinated by the size of some of the fish. Also manged to try delicious local food and snacks. The guides, Kumie and Fumito, were knowledge and friendly. They were also helpful and patient in explaining the Japanese custom and culture. We were very glad that we have joined this tour and would definitely try out other tours that the company conduct when we come back to Tokyo. We would recommend this tour to anyone who like to have a guided tour to the fish market. "

Eriko was our guide and was very friendly and very helpful in taking care our needs ( we brought a stroller and she arranged a place to store it for us while we visiting the inner tuskiji market). The guide speaks good English if anyone had doubt in the language barrier, dont be! During the tour, eriko gave us many information on japanese food culture, their way of preparing, buying foods etc. We learned a lot from this tour about the local dining habit as well. She also waited us patiently while we wanted to buy things in the market and giving us recommendation from time to time.Overall, this is a very good experience. Join this tour while you still can! (the inner tsukiji market will be relocated some time next year)Thanks again eriko-san for taking care of my family and make our trip memorable!"

We enjoyed the street food tour so much we booked for the fish market. Both were very well run - knowledgable guides with reasonable English. There were some unexpected activities on the street food tour such as trying on a kimono and checking out a local supermarket/department store. My son enjoyed learning how to make a pot of tea (even if he has not developed a taste for drinking it). I learnt a great deal about life in the city, how to tackle eating some of the foods and a bit of history of the areas. Amazingly fresh sushi on the fish market tour. Well worth doing!"

Yuko gave us market information but the cultural tips as well that add so much to the experience.The tour introduced us to the Japanese omelet, delicious, to shrimp and scallop cakes, huge oysters, stand up sushi and superb sake. So it was a feast for the body as well as the senses and we highly recommend it. Thank you again, Yuko and Yu."

In case you're wondering how they managed to accommodate such a large group of people, the tour company sent out 4 tour guides then split us into 4 smaller walking groups.Then we went and walked around the inner and outer fish market. If you've never come to Japan before, and want to get a close and in depth look at the Tsukuji Fish Market, this is definitely a great way to do so. And what makes the tour even better is that there is food included.There is also a good amount of flexibility built into the tour. For instance, although there were only 7 tastings included, we also had the option to explore a little and try other foods (which we bought ourselves) that we saw along our tour.All an all, a very good experience. My only wish was that there were more tastings at the beginning of the tour, as we hadn't eaten breakfast prior. But by the end of the tour, I was definitely very full!"

We had close perdonal attention and were able to safely navigate the complex (and chaotic) maze that is the Inner Market. Importantly, we were able to better understand the workings of the place due yo the information and access provided by our experienced guides.The Food Tour was a private tour with Yu-san. He brought us to the places a local would patronise and we were extremely privileged to be exposed to food and drink that we as tourists would not have an opportunity to partake.I would be truing out this comoany's other tours the next time I come bavk to Tokyo.

Natsu-san, our nice and pleasant guide, was very knowledgeable about the place and brought us to areas in the market where only the locals would know. While we were not able to watch the famous fish auction, it was an experience watching the melon auction though. The outside market was crowded with tourists. However, every food stall offers a sample of their products. But be sure to try the wasabi and mayo peanuts. Delicious! I was able to buy some to bring back home. I was also amazed at how they made the omelet; it takes some serious skill to prepare that. Natsu-san also brought us to this sushi restaurant for lunch about ten minutes away from the market where everything we tried was delicious and reasonable priced at that. She mentioned that this restaurant, although quite new, is very popular with the locals."

Highly recommended, take plenty of photos, but always ask permission before snapping the market staff. Michiko was normally capable of getting them to smile!"

Yu spoke English well and was very knowledgable about the fish market. I was worried that the 2 hours of waiting before the market opens (that everyone has to sit through between getting in line and the tuna market) feeling really long, but Yu kept us company and shared many travel stories.His back story of why he started this tour company made clear his love for travel and givingback to the travel community.As for the tour itself, there was less structure to it than I thought there would be. It wasn't a linear narration but instead we just asked all the questions we had until we had no more. He knew everything and it's possible we never gave him time to get back on track after we barraged him questions,.After the tuna auction (which he gave really good explanations for), he was able to sneak us into parts of the outer market normally restricted until 9am or later. It was amazing to see the tuna broken down during these early hours when other tourists aren't allowed in.He also joined us for some great breakfast in the end and got us to our next subway stop. All in all, Yu was a great tour guide and I'd recommend him to anyone who wants to see the fish market."

We not only learned about the food and tourist economy, but also what it is like to live in Tokyo. The fish market tour was a must do. We were able to talk with vendors only available because of or tour guide. Come hungry, since there are many food samples. And each sample is more than a few bites. And all the foods are delicious. Try everything, even that which is unfamiliar. Memorable foods were the Japanese omelette (different, but delicious), the dried bonito (we brought some home), the large oysters (terrific if you like oysters).Our second tour was of the Asakusa neighborhood. Again, lots of delicious food with a great guide. The sweet potato ice cream was also delicious. The variety of salts was surprising. I think we were the first guests to buy salt and a salt cellar.This company could not have done more to accommodate our schedule, last minute booking and personal interests.

We enjoyed it very much, Nori was a pleasure to get to know and was very helpful in all ways. The fruit/fish market is like a maze, so we were very happy to have someone guiding us. We also visited the street market outside, which was a lot of fun. Tasting included Japanese omelette, sake, crab cake, green tea and a giant oyster, quite a challenge! The tour ended with a sushi lunch at a very nice restaurant. I recommend this tour whole-heartedly and would like to thank Nori for being such a nice guy and answering all our questions without hesitation. We had a great stay in Tokyo and this tour was one of the highlights."

He is very gentle, friendly and offers an excellent immersion in the local culture, food, and fish market! Also, it is very convenient to take this tour since Nori has good connections with the local traders in the fish market, so you can get a very good impression even without waking up at 2 AM to see the tuna auction... we saw a melon auction and still interesting:) Definitely recommend!"

My son and I recently moved to Tokyo and hadn't quite had a \"tourist\" experience yet, so we signed up for the food tour when a friend came to town for a visit. It was excellent! Yu was funny and very knowledgable about the areas and he made it entertaining for my 8 year old son. We tasted an array of traditional Japanese foods and snack and even had a complete sushi lunch. My son was a bit taken back from the wasabi, but he was still able to enjoy himself. I would definitely recommend this tour for anyone wanting to know more about the amazing seafood that Tokyo has to offer. Next time we have friends in town, we will definitely go on this tour again."

The three of us (myself, my hubby, and my dad) had a great time navigating though the Tsukiji fish market with our guides from Tokyo FooDrink Tours, Yu and Satoe. Without them, we would have had a tough time finding our way around, communicating with the different vendors, and understanding the auctions going on. Lots of food stops combined with info about the market, how it operates, and it's history. I have many food restrictions, and they worked tirelessly during the tour to ensure I had food to nibble on too....totally unnecessary but great service and much appreciated. Thanks for the excellent experience, Tokyo FooDrink Tours! We hope to come back soon for another tour! Definitely recommended as they give lots of personal attention to their guests and the groups are small making the whole experience pleasant."

Not having been to Tokyo before Asakusa is a great place to start, although quite touristy in many respects, it\u2019s vibrant with a lot to see and eat and drink. We went to a wide variety of food and drink places, starting with the Asahi brewery. There\u2019s a much wider variety of beers than we realised! One of the stops we really enjoyed was for Monja \u2013 a kind of omlette, you have a hot plate in front of you and you cook yourself. We would never have attempted to go into a place like this ourselves not speaking any Japanese at all.We also really enjoyed the stop at the Sake shop, not just sampling different varieties, but the owners were absolutely lovely and full of interesting information about sake.Yu was really good company for the evening, and it was great to have him to ourselves so we could ask many questions about Tokyo as well as how best to spend our time during our short stay. One of our favourite food tours out of about 6 or so that we've done in various countries recently."

Nori was extremely knowledgable and an entertaining guide. I thought our kids may have got a bored but Nori was able to grab their attention for the full tour. The fact that he was constantly pushing food at them probably helped!!We all enjoyed the tour and the food options were plentiful and interesting. As well as the street food options (including the biggest oyster you have ever seen) we finished at a local sushi restaurant which was excellent.We tried many foods that we probably wouldn't have tried without Nori's guidance. Culturally and language wise Japan poses some challenges.We would highly recommend Nori & Tokyo FooDrink Tour."

I was impressed with the variation of fish and the beauty and care taken with all food products by all of the good hard working at the markets. The cleanliness of each market along with our stroll down the three foodie streets were equally impressive. Yu knows his stuff and delivers interesting facts and without hesitation answers all questions. He his a good conversationalist and whole heartedly wants one to have an enjoyable time and sample loads of local foods - which we did - Yum! The length of the tour was spot on - three hours which allows one to visit yet another interesting and exciting area of Tokyo in the afternoon. Lastly, the tours was very good value for the price.

I was part of a small group of three with two guide, Yu-san and Yoko-san. They started the tour at the Tsukiji Hongan-Ji. Our guides started the tour right away, giving us information about anything and everything we asked on our way to the Market and during our walk through it. We went into the interior part of the market, which is not really allowed for the public, but our guide had connections that made it okay. There were vendors after vendors who were still hard at work. The large tuna fish was definitely a sight to see. The variety and quality of fish, fruits and vegetables was amazing and colorful!We also toured the outer market that is open to the public. Our guides walked us around, allowing us to stop and shop when we wanted, and took us to certain shops to try different foods. We had tamagoyaki that was so fluffy and delicious. We also had freshly made fish cakes, the freshest and largest raw oysters from Hokkaido, little samples of dried bonito, marinated clams, seaweed, tea, and sake. It was quite a fun and tasty experience. We ended the tour we a sushi lunch at a nearby place. It was all included in the tour. Overall, I had such a great time. I enjoyed talking to everyone on the tour. The guides Yu-san and Yoko-san were very friendly and informational. I'd probably do the tour again! I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone looking to explore the Tsukiji market. It's an excellent experience!"

I loved everything that we had tasted and particularly the huge oyster. My mouth still waters as I think of it. DELICIOUS!! Noriko had also taught us to appreciate the differences in Shrines and temples in Japan. Now, when I look at pictures of a Japanese shrine or temple, I can tell if it is a Shinto shrine or a Buddhist temple. I can do the tour again with Noriko after the Tsukiji market moves to the new site. It is totally worthwhile."

My fiance and I were on our first trip to Japan and selected this tour group for our first day based on the great TripAdvisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. We actually did 2 tours with this company.1. We signed up for the fish auction at Tsukiji Fish Market and it was just my fiance and myself met by Yu, one of the owners. As it was just the two of us, we received all of the attention! Yu is an excellent guide. He knew exactly how to get into the best part of the auction, where to eat immediately afterwards (we had some amazing sushi), and gave us a full tour of the inner market. We really got to see things we would have never seen on our own and the explanations were excellent. We also got an extra explanation of a Shinto shrine we passed by and got to learn some things about the religion and its practices I never would have picked up on.2. Later that day, we had another tour scheduled that was run by Yu and another guide, Tae. We had signed up for the Asuska Street Sweets tour and it was again, another private tour. Tae was as great of a guide as Yu so having both of them made this an awesome experience. We really saw so much in Asuska and learned so much about the area. We didn't just try food, we learned about the history or stories around some of them. Since it was just us, we were never pressured or rushed to do anything. Yu and Tae really went above and beyond to make sure we had an awesome day and stayed with us much longer than had been advertised.As if the awesome tours weren't enough, Yu remained in contact with me throughout my time in Japan. He was happy to give me restaurant suggestions (which led us to an excellent tempura restaurant) and if you really want to have an awesome few hours in Tokyo, definitely book a tour with Tokyo FooDrink!"

Thankfully, we opted for this tour rather than trying to tackle it on our own. Yu and Fumiko gracefully guided us through the bustling and noisy market filled with incredible sounds, smells and sights! We learned the inner workings of the fish market; how it is run, the amount of people and fish that make their way through it, and what the future of the fish market holds. We saw sea creatures (big and small) from all over the world, and were impressed with how many of the fish vendors Yu had relationships with! The most impressive though were the massive tuna. The first half of the tour filled our minds with information, and the second half filled our bellies with delicious treats! We ate eggs, fish balls, oysters, bonito and just about every snack that lined the shops of the outer market. Yu was so knowledgeable about all of the offerings of the outer market, and where to go to get the best things to eat. We enjoyed the sake tasting and the special traditional souvenir sake cups! The perfect ending to the tour was the full meal of sushi. We devoured the fresh and tender pieces of raw fish at a nearby sushi restaurant. Everything about this tour was perfectly executed. From the meeting place, to the tastings, to the information, to the secret view of the market. A trip to Tokyo would not be complete without a FooDrink Tour."

All of the foods were very nice, but the key part of the day out is it is an opportunity to find more about the food and how they are used and be able to shop in a way that would be difficult without any Japanese language skills.We were also told about and shown around places near to the street that were not immediately about the food.Best done at the start of a holiday to give you an introduction to Japanese food and to give you a bit of confidence when ordering in the future. It was all done excellently. We left with full tummies and full brains, and eager to try more Japanese foods."

We were about 20 minutes late and was surprised to see her still waiting for us at the meeting spot. She was very patient with us and took us into both the inner and outer market. She would also help us to order foods that we saw along the way. I think the tour could be improved by changing the menu. The fish cake and sushi were not that good. This is just my own opinion however. It may be better to find another sushi shop, even if they must charge a slightly higher price. Overall a great way to spend a morning in Tokyo."

            "review": "A Must-Do Tour for any Foodie. Nori was our food guide and we had a fabulous personal tour by him of the world-famous Tsukiji Fish Market inner and outer markets. Our group size was just three and apparently maximum tour group size is five. When one sees the narrow walkways and aisles in the Inner Market, it makes a lot of sense to limit group size. Nori showed us areas of the market we never would have found on our own. We really enjoyed seeing a 70 kg tuna being expertly carved up for an auction winner from just maybe 5 feet away. We also saw an auction for melons (yes, they auction for those pricey melons too). Nori shared interesting insights like the rock-hard hardness of a dried bonito fish (process takes 6 months) and the cost of one of the large tuna sword like knife (1.5 million yen). Besides the wife and I, we were hooked up with a pleasant young man from Duesseldorf, Germany. It was a very interesting 3.5 hour walking tour with a full and very good sushi lunch at end of the tour. Note that the rest of the food menu are more or less street food samplings (omelet, dried bonito, oyster, fish cake, fried octopus, green tea, and sake), so be prepared to not have a regular meal until about 12:30pm if tour starts at 8:30am. All in all, a very good tour and value for the price and we are very glad we had a free day from our Japan group tour to do this \"on our own\"."

I have been to Tsukiji before without a tour guide but this was much more meaningful. The sushi lunch at the finish was delicious!

Fantastic service. As far as the tour is concerned, it was great. This is not something I recommend you do by yourself ( the market is huge and you would lose out on some of the background provided by the tour guide). Given that it's the largest fish and vegetable market in terms of size and daily trade volumes, it's worth a visit. The sushi lunch at the end of the tour was fantastic. We were lucky to be seated in the back room and be served by the head chef. That was definitely the highlight of the tour for me. We had a great conversation with the chef and the sushi was excellent. Thank you Nori!!"

We took three tours (on different days) with Tokyo FooDrink Tours: Tsukiji Fish Market with Hamarikyu Garden, Asakusa & Kitchen Goods Street Food, and Sunamachi Local Shopping Street. This was a great way to experience a wide variety of Japanese food and drink. All three tours were well-paced with plenty of time to take photos and ask questions. The Tsukiji Fish Market Tour with Eriko was an exploration of the inner and outer market with stops for trying foods like Japanese omelet, fresh oyster, fish cakes, and more, before taking in a view of the whole market. We then had lunch at a stand-up sushi place before heading over to Hamarikyu Garden for matcha and a sweet. The Asakusa & Kitchen Goods Street Foods Tour with Yoshiko and Fumito started at a craft beer place next to Asahi Beer Hall and then moved on to Senosji Temple and the area around it for treats such as sweet potato ice cream (superlative), miso, rice cakes, and more, before meandering through \u2018kitchen town\u2019, stopping on \u2018pub street\u2019 for some burdock fries and ending with ordering ramen from a vending machine (super yummy). The Sunamachi Local Shopping Street with Noriko and Yu, was a true off-the-radar experience on a narrow street filled with shops and food stalls. Here we experienced tempura, yakitori, sake, minced cutlet (yummy), learned to make green tea, had some sort of rice with clams at a very busy stall\u2026We were glad we took these tours; Tokyo is very confusing and most places have little if any information in English or staff who speak English. After these tours we felt orientated enough to go out on our own. Oh, and great way for teens to experience Tokyo\u2014 who doesn't love food!"

Our lovely tour guide is Noako. She kept us entertain and making sure we are ok and happy throughout the tour.The tour started with introduction of the area before we proceed inside the market ... fist stop was the famous Japanese omelet on a stick ... sweet omelet so definitely a unique taste. In the same area there are several of Japanese restaurants serving fresh sushi/ sashimi ... you better be prepared to wait and wait and wait to get your turn though!Next we proceed through vegetables market ....high quality vegetables then see the melons auction.We then proceed through the main fish market ... amazing place to experience. Definitely the biggest fish market in the world. Throughout the tour Naoko provided us with the information and knowledge which was great.Then we proceed to a vantage point and have a nice overview of the market and you could see how big the place is.We then start walking through small streets outside the market ... tasting \"dried bonito\" ... \"Japanese tea\" ... fresh oyster .... fried fish cake .... sake. Then we finish off the tour with a nice sushi meal in one of the restaurant just outside the market.This is the last year the fish market will be there ... next year the whole place will be moved and the space will be occupied by new media center for the up coming Olympics!!The tour definitely was great fun and it's definitely worth it.Once again, thanks to Naoko for the fun time."

He loves sweets (I think so.... ;)... )Entertaining: Japanese are not traditionally funny, except on the TV. But he does have a sense of humour while being very friendly and humble.

We are all beginners of japaneese food and tought this was a great way to try some different types of food. Tour of the fish market was great, but a lot of the food tasting is free samples as snacks, nuts, dried fish etc. Included in the tour is japaneese omelette, sake, tea, oyster (not for the faint hearted) and sushi lunch in the end of the tour. The oyster came a it as a chock, its crazy huge and raw and Im afraid the guide had to help us eat them all up. In the end of the tour we all went to a great sushi resturant, but it was crowded and we had to eat while my parents where waiting outside. So the highlight of the tour, as my parent where having sushi for the first time was a bit caotic, when they finally got two seats it was in the far end of the resturant and we where not able to talk to each other. (It would probably be a good idea that the tour makes table reservations for the group in advance)Overall this is a great way to spend a day, but remember if you are a \"first timer\" on japanese food to be very clear with the guides that you might not be able to eat everything that is served."

He was very friendly and his English was good.Unfortunately two of our group got lost on the way and came late (we had already started). The owner of the tours came and collected these two and helped them catch up, therefore we didn't have to stop and wait. We all caught up at the end of walking through the vegetable and fish markets. I thought this was great of the tour group so that everyone got the experience they were expecting without needing to wait/skip things.I read a previous review about the amount of food, well we had the opposite (an American guy mentioned 4/5 times he was annoyed he'd eaten breakfast). I think I would eat something small before this tour but if you are hungry / thirsty / need to go to the toilet I suggest you ask the leader as we did a few times and they will cater for you. We had a couple of unexpected stops due to people in the group asking for things.It's tough at these types of markets to get past your preconceived thoughts of what the quality of food might be like based on the look of it or the shop selling it (this is where a guide comes in handy). I am not the best with stomaching things at the best of times, I ate everything on this tour and had no issues. The highlight was the LARGEST oyster I have ever seen and it was simply delicious!!! Get a second even if you need to pay.The sushi restaurant at the end was amazing. There was no 3 hour line like the shops we saw in the market and I have no doubt we were eating the same / very similar food.The tour was great, I highly recommend this and the guides were both very friendly. Enjoy."

We thought this was truly a food tour and every other food tour we have been on, you eat from start to end, learning about the place as you go from food to food. We started the tour with the Japanese omelet and it was very tasty. But after that the food ended... for hours. Since we were expecting this to be a usual food tour, we didn't eat breakfast. Huge mistake! The fish market was incredible and we really enjoyed it. So glad we went. But, by the time we finished looking through the market, we were so hungry that I actually felt shaky from the heat and lack of food. We thought that after the market was over the real eating would begin... not so much. There is a good amount of taste testing FREE samples, but not much to fill very hungry bellies. I'm sure I would have enjoyed this portion of the tour if we all weren't getting cranky from being so hungry.Then Finally! We got to the food. The sushi place at the end was delicious! But don't take the tour thinking that it is a food tour. It's not. Lunch at the end doesn't make something a food tour. And several things listed on the \"menu\" are free samples. Yes there are a few snacks in between, but that still doesn't make it a food tour.Did I enjoy the tour? Yes. Would I do it again? Yes, if I ate first."

We decided to book a tour late the night before but the company replied within a short period confirming our booking. We met with our guide Nori (seaweed in english which he told us we could call him) outside a temple near the markets we were a bit early so he told us to wait in the air conditioned temple to get out of the heat while he waited for the other couple on the tour, which was extremely thoughtful of him.Nori was great. He was really friendly and had a lot of knowledge of the markets. The markets were huge and without Nori I imagine we would have just wondered round aimlessly and missed most of the sights. He also provided heaps of interesting information that we would never have known. The markets themselves are a sight to behold. They are huge and there are so many people going about their daily business. I felt like I was getting in the way a bit but the locals seemed to tolerate the tourists and Nori did his best to keep us out of the way. It really was an amazing sight seeing these markets in full flight. After the markets we wondered the stalls in the outer markets and tried so many different things, like fresh oysters, fried fish cakes, sake, dried bento and cooked and raw tuna. This was an experiential in itself and really interesting. The tour ended with some sushi at a local sushi store. This included much more than I expected and on top of all the other foods we had tried we didn't bother with lunch after this. I'm not a huge raw fish fan but this was delicious and a great way to end the tour. In all I thought this was a great way to experience the fish markets. They are an amazing place and Nori did a great job of ensuring that we made the most of the experience. I couldn't recommend this company enough. "

It was a very fun tour where we ventured into the heart of the fish market and saw all the workings of the fish industry in Japan. This tour is not for the faint of heart, as you will see fish in ways you have never seen them before. We then sampled lots of street food samples (grasshopper included) and had several dishes (omelet, oyster, sushi, and sake). There is a surprise after the sake, which was really cool (I wont spoil it for others). The tour guides were owners of the company. You could tell they were owners because they were very passionate and excited about the tour. They took good care of us and planned a nice structured itinerary, with water and a bathroom break. The tour met about 30 minutes from our hotel via the metro and we got lost on the metro on our way out there. We arrived a half-hour late to the tour and we emailed the tour company telling them we got lost. They responded immediately and dispatched a second tour guide, Yu, to rush over on bike and meet us. That was really really nice of the tour company. Overall, a very up close and personal tour of the fish market from very passionate tour guides, with interesting food and a nice surprise souvenir at the end. I don\u2019t think you can truly experience and understand this massive fish market without a tour like this!"

After about eighty years at Tsukiji, the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market is moving at the end of next year to make way for a venue for the Olympic Games, being held in Tokyo in 2020.Although it\u2019s often said one of the \u201cmust do\u201d things about Tokyo is to get up early (three or four in the morning) and to line-up to witness the excitement of the seafood auction at the market, that\u2019s not really \u201cmy kind of thing\u201d. But I do love food, and I love learning about the culture of a country through food, and so I booked to take part in the Tsukiji Fish Market Food Tourhttp://tomodachitravel.com/tsukiji-fish-market-food-tourOver the course of three and a half hours (starting at 8.30am), we wandered around the markets, and tasted dried bonito, Japanese tea, fresh oysters, fried fish cake, sake, and also witnessed the art involved in making Japanese omelettes. And I learned so much on this tour. I never knew, for example, fish with bigger eyes were the ones which you\u2019re most likely to found in deeper water (though of course it makes total sense). I\u2019d also never seen the wasabi plant before, and noted when I shared the photograph earlier today on social media, many others hadn\u2019t either. The tour ended with sushi at a stand-up restaurant called Chiyoda Sushi.http://www.chiyoda-sushi.co.jp/There are quite a few of them around Tokyo, and Nori described them as places where you can obtain good sushi at reasonable prices. I thought it was probably the best sushi I\u2019ve had in my life, to be honest.Nori was a really great guide: knowledgeable, friendly, and with a sense of humour. He told us he also worked as a part-time primary school teacher, and was a member of the Japanese defence force, and so he was also very good at keeping us on track, and stopped us from getting run over in the hustle and bustle of the market. I also think it helped our group was small: only four people, a Chinese woman, a stay at home mum who home-schools from Singapore with a real passion for Japanese food; and a young couple from the United States, with a young child, and with a passion for travel and food also.At 9,000 yen (about $90 AUD), I thought the tour was excellent value and would highly recommend it to you.I have shared some photographs on my blog. http://jamesobrien.id.au/2015/07/22/tsukiji-and-sunset/"

My wife and I did the Tsukiji and Sunamachi tour and we couldn't be happier with the decision to do this tour!First was the Tsukiji tour with Nori-san and Yu-san. We wanted to get a true feeling of the market, the vendors, and the general layout of the place, and these two guides really helped us understand Tsukiji in a way that you wouldn't if you were to go by yourself. It can be a VERY intimidating place on your own, but having Nori-san and Yu-san guide us around was fantastic! You can tell that Yu-san, which is the owner of the company, takes a lot of consideration to the places you visit and the vendors you meet. It's clear that they've established relationships with some of the vendors to allow us to take the time to talk with the vendors and appreciate what they do. The bits of food at every stop was delicious, which included Tamago (egg omelette), fresh oyster, sake, and sushi.Next, we went to the Sunamachi shopping street (one of the biggest in Tokyo). It's a very local area that would probably be missed by many tourists if you weren't directly told about it. The market is frequented by locals that are looking to grab a meal, groceries, snacks, or general shopping, so it really gives you a feel of the life of an average resident. It's also a really nice break from the crowds of central Tokyo since it's farther out from the center and you don't see many tourists there at all.However, what really made this tour memorable was how flexible Yu-san was to the detours we wanted to take. We walked by a Kimono/Yukata store in Sunamachi and my wife wanted to buy a yukata. Yu-san was kind enough to help with the translation, and stick around for extra time while the shop owner tailored the yukata for my wife which took around 45 minutes. Thank you very much Yu-san!Tips for the tours: Don't feel shy to go into the shops, try some food that isn't part of their planned itinerary, and pick up souvenirs and whatnot along the way. The guides are more than happy to help out. Also, when visiting Tsukiji, wear closed toe shoes. There are lots of heavy machinery and water flying everywhere, so protect your feet with actual shoes.I highly recommend going on these tours!"

I didn't know if I was going to be alone or with a large group but ended up with the guide and two couples. I was happy with the numbers. Our guide Eriko San was very sweet. Her English quite fluent allowing me to have a good understanding of what was going on. She was very knowledgable of the area and could explain what we were seeing. She was attentive and explained things as we went along. Her patience impressed me as I tend to want to stay and try different things, which I was able to do as I pleased. She walked is through Tsukiji fish market which is chaotic and dangerous for someone not familiar-definitely don't wear sandals or flip flops to that place. We made it out safely, explored the fruit market, visited some shops ( I bought a fantastic all purpose kitchen knife with my name engraved in Kanji) and ended up in this unpretentious looking sushi place not far from the market. The place is standing room only and very small which can be challenging after walking so much beforehand but i'm always game for something knew. Well it didn't disappoint. We had some head chefs and trainee (this location if i remember correctly serves as training locale for young sushi chefs) who graciously allowed us to take pictures. I've had sushi before but this exceed my expectations ...... Exactly what I was hoping for, eating sushi in Japan. Everything was good and I wanted more but was surprisingly full after the plate I had. This place gets busy fast and is very popular so don't expect to sit and chat afterwards as more customer are waiting to be seated.After this, we went to Hamarikyu garden where we had macha cold tea ( it was ridiculously hot) and some traditional sweets, sitting on tatami mats. We also walked along the perimeter and I pleasantly chatted with Eriko San who explained the history behind the garden. She made sure I was keeping hydrated as it was a scorcher that day.I had a very pleasant day overall and would do it again.If you are looking for something low key to do, book this tour-it's worth it and very affordable."

I think one of the specialties of their tour would be the small group; one tour guide takes only 4 people. While walking along the streets, the tour guide explained lots of interesting Japanese culture to us, and he also answered any of our questions. In addition, just as the tour name, we tried a variety of traditional Japanese food and drinks. My friends and I really impressed by the tour plan and the hospitality of the tour guide a lot!

Our guide spoke great English and we went on the tour with one other couple from the U.S., both very nice and interested in Japan culture and of course, food. We had been to Japan a few times before for business, but never had a chance to explore. I have to say, the tour was fantastic. We covered so much ground we feel like experts of the fish market now, only having gone that first time with FooDrink. We went again two days later to eat more food on our own, because the food there is so diverse and so good, you can't really just go once. I think if this is your first time to Tokyo or even just your first time to the fish market, having a guide like FooDrink is an absolute must. It is a crazy and hectic place to explore the fish market and you definitely need a guide, regardless if you are fluent in Japanese or not. You would otherwise get lost, waste time, and not get the most of the market without a proper guide. FooDrink were great and we would have been lost without them. Thanks so much, we definitely recommend this."

There are many shops for the public (not just wholesalers and restauranteurs) that sell food and drink, both fresh and packaged, as well as other goods. We stopped at several for tastings that were available to the public, and at others where my Tokyo FooDrink Tour ticket covered the cost of some substantial tastings. I definitely didn't need lunch after the morning tour. My guide was one of the company's founders and it was very pleasant to walk and talk with him (my language is English). He taught me several things, including the proper way to approach a Shinto shrine. Definitely dress casually, wear walking shoes (not sandals!!), and bring your camera and an appetite.

The Tsukiji Market is a special and historical place in the city, and it's great to experience it with knowledgable tour guides such as Sayoko and Yu. They were friendly and catered the tour to the group's interests and needs. They felt more like friends than guides! The food that we enjoyed were highlights and \"hidden gems\" in the sometimes overwhelming market. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone wishing to experience true Japanese culture. Thank you for the wonderful experience!"

Did both the Sunamachi and the Tsukijii market tours.Both tours were great. Very different and complementing.The Sunamachi tour gave us an introduction to a local market where the locals shop for food. Great experience.The Tsuikjii market tour took us inside this very busy and touristic market - showing us and explaining the behind the scenes of the market. The guides were great! The food was excellent! A highly recommended experience when visiting Tokyo."

Can\u2019t say enough about these guys \u2013 we had such a fantastic morning exploring the incredible (and overwhelming) Tsukiji Market with Yoshika and Yu. Honestly, without a guide in the market, you wouldn\u2019t know pretty much anything about what you are looking at and they, obviously, knew all the best spots and stops for photos etc (note \u2013 always ask before taking pictures here, many merchants don\u2019t want photos taken). Did I mention the food? Tried everything from egg on a stick to fresh bonito flakes and sushi. So delicious. You also get a bonus aerial view of the market from their secret look out spot ;) Great viewpoint to see the busy marketplace in action and get a proper sense of the impressive size.

The tour guide Tai was absolutely fantastic. She explained everything superbly well. She answered all questions asked and introduced a fascinating side of Japan. At the indoor market we even experienced a melon auction and then we had a wonderfully delicious time sampling food in the outer market. She even let us stop and shop at a fascinating (and cheap!) ceramic store. At the gardens she explained the history and art of the tea ceremony. I even got to see a picture of her beautiful daughters in kimonos. In one day I learnt a little bit of everything, history, culture, art, religion and food. She even took me to my hotel at the end of the tour. She recommended places to go to and things to see. There's so much we did and all I can say is, it's something you can't miss. Thank you so much for a wonderful time."

I had originally booked with another company for Tsukiji tour with kimono experience however was told about 3 days before that they cannot confirm the tour for me as I am alone and the tour needs minimum 2 to start. I scrambled to look for a replacement and found Tokyo FooDrink. On the day itself, I was pleasantly surprised that I am the only guest so this turns out to be a private tour. It was much appreciated that they didn't cancel on me. My guide was Fumito san and he was great! It was a very detailed tour that brings you to the inner and outer market to see various activities with explanation including a melon auction (similar to tuna auction but smaller scale). The tour also included visit to 2 temples which I would have missed if I go by myself. Being a foodie, the highlight of tour is the delicious food I get to sample. Tokyo FooDrink will bring you to the shops that provide quality food. Japanese omelet, dried bonito, fresh oyster, fried fish cake, Japanese green tea and sake are what I've tried. Thanks to Fumito san, I even tasted fresh sea urchin for the first time. The tour ended with a sushi lunch at nearby restaurant and Fumito san was helpful in getting me in the right direction for my next destination. P.S. You will also get to go to a secret spot in the market and also walk away with a unique souvenir."

I recently decided to choose both the fish market tour and Sunamachi tour after looking for alternatives to other seemingly average food tours on other sites, and this one being high rated on TripAdvisor. My wife and I had Tae for the fish market and Tae and Yu for the Sunamachi tour. I did ponder over whether we could have just done the fish market on our own but we're glad we booked in for this tour, as we explored parts of the market that we probably wouldn't have navigated ourselves, or even thought that we would be allowed to enter. The Sunamachi tour was a nice surprise as it's actually a traditionally non-touristy street and with great street food that seemed cheaper than the main areas, in fact we didn't see any other tourists at all! Go on an empty stomach as we seemed to get many extra freebies from the stall owners that loved the fact that tourists were coming to visit. Both Yu and Tae were very knowledgable, friendly, and courteous, and even helped us with advice for some other plans that we had for the rest of the trip. In summary, if you're a foodie (or even if you aren't), i recommend doing these tours!"

It was my boyfriends birthday, and I asked Yu-san for a custom tour. Having told him that he worked as a chef, Yu-san took us on a tour through the Kitchen Street and serveral other foodie hotspots in Asakusa. He also got my boyfriend a very nice gift in one of the kitchen shops, which was greatly appreciated and well chosen. At the end of the tour, he took us to a very authentic izakaya, where we tried a lot of truly Japanese dishes. A few of his colleagues stopped by to meet us and make a toast to my boyfriend's birthday. We had a lot of fun and they made our day into a very special one.

They did an exceptional job and are very energetic. The language barrier in Japan is significant, and both Yu and Nori speak great English. They have a good relationship with a lot of the vendors which goes a long ways in the market. We were able to closely observe tuna butchers in action and mingle with many of the workers. Hard to believe but we watched a muskmelon auction that was pretty intense and one of the highlights of the tour. The food tasting was great and both guides knew a lot about the history of Japanese cuisine. The sake tasting came with a square cedar sake box cup which was a nice souvenir included in the price of the tour. A pleasant surprise was the inclusion of the Tsujiki Hongan-ji Buddhist Temple and the Namiyoke Inari Shrine. Yu and Nori provided a lot of background information about the history and significance of the locations as well as detailing the customs locals adhere to.

They will even bring you to see a live fruit auction.The 1st stop is a visit to a temple as that was the assemble point. Then we went on to taste a 6 inches tamago per person. It was warm & really yummy, so, dont worry if you didn't get breakfast before the tour. Then there will be a brief tour of the surrounding markets before going into the inner market where its only meant for wholesale clients and where the main attractions are. After the inner market will be touring the outter markets where you get to taste some green tea, sake, almonds, bonito flakes & fish cake (full size). This is where you get a chance to buy some local produce. In between there will be a visit to a Shrine.The tour finish off by lunch at a sushi restaurant outside of the market area.Overall a very enjoyable morning tour. Take note that strollers for children and wheelchairs are not allowed within the inner market area. For those travelling with little children, they will need to walk quite a distance through the tour and at some point wet and slightly cramp space.Special thanks to Yumi and Fumito, our wonderful tour guides and Yu, Nori as well.We had a great time and highly recommend this tour to anyone interested to see where all the fresh Japanese produce come from."

We opened up good ol tripadvisor and Yu's had one of the highest rated reviews, so I knew we were in for a good tour.The Sunamachi Market tour itself was very good - Yu showed us around, we ate great food, and learned about the various vendors. What really made this tour special is Yu himself. He has such as an awesome personality, he's so warm and welcoming that after chatting with him for a few, I felt like I was talking to a long time pal. He truly is passionate about his work as I can see the relationships he has with the various vendors - he knows their food, their history, but more importantly he knows how it impacts the local culture.I can't recommend him enough, next time we're back in Tokyo we're booking another with Yu!"

I arrived early at the meet point, keeping time on my side to allow for any unknown delay, and to my surprise Michiko and Yu were already there to meet me. First impressions were of warmth and happiness - i was greeted with smiles and welcomes, affirmations a great day lied ahead. The tour was simply fantastic, at every turn and new experience for me, I was led through wonderfully relevant explanations and details about the surroundings encountered. The narrative and knowledge during the tour really made it worthwhile. I could see other (non tour tourists) around at times looking lost, or being swayed by the crowds, but Michiko and Yu had a great sense of knowing when to push effortlessly though the crowds or stay in a location that was well worth enjoyment. There were many food experiences on the tour that were so very enjoyable. Omelet, variety of dried seafood, succulent fresh oyster, saki (with memorable wood square cup) and of course sushi. I finished the tour with Michiko and Yu waving goodbye to me at the subway entrance and I have to say, they really made my day. It was an awesome experience for me, and I am very thankful for the wonderfully attentive tour they provided. My wife even said i could not stop talking about it for day's after I returned."

He and his tour partner Michiko were both extremely kind, knowledgeable, and funny. We saw the biggest tuna we have ever seen and so many different types of seafood - it was crazy! Even with so much fish, the market does not smell and is kept very clean (in case you were worried!) We tried a bunch of different food on the tour and Yu knows all the best spots!! Had the best tuna sashimi of our lives at a small stall at the outdoor market where we would have never stopped at on our own. We ended the tour with delicious sushi in an authentic (not touristy) sushi restaurant that we also would never have found on our own. This tour is a definite must for an enjoyable and interesting (and yummy!) morning! Thank you so much Yu and Michiko!!"

If you are interested in Japanese food and culture then this is a must do, and with the Tsujiki fish market being moved soon then your only chance to see it is now. The guide Yu-san is excellent. Informative, courteous, entertaining and allowing you to experience as much of what is on offer as possible. The food is fantastic and can be as challenging as you want it to be. There is no pressure to buy anything but the opportunity is there if you wish. The sushi at the end of the tour is outstanding. I cant recommend this tour highly enough. Thank you Yu-san and Kaori-san."

They were really friendly and immediately put us at ease. With the extra few minutes we had, we had a quick look in the temple where me met before heading over to the market.The tour through the inner market is fascinating, being in amongst the hustle and bustle and watching the workers preparing tuna.The outer market with all of the various foods to try is one of the food highlights of my life. I've never known tuna sashimi to melt in my mouth like it did. The oyster I had was leagues above every other oyster I have tried and the various dried fish we tried were amazing.The sushi we finished with was again on another level to anything I have ever tried.Yu and Kaori were informative, fun, engaging and all you could hope for from a tour guide.If you love fish and are in Tokyo, this tour is an absolute must."

Yu, my guide, was very knowledgeable and patient. The inner market tour highlights the wholesale section and you may even get to see an auction (I got to see a melon auction). Trying different foods through the outer market is fantastic and Yu's guidance on the shops and foods is very helpful. The tour ends at a sushi standing restaurant nearby. It was delicious and service was superb!"

I was grateful that Yu managed to connect with me and picked me up at Tsukiji Shijo station. The tour was informative and interesting. It touched on various areas of the market which I wouldn't probably have done it myself. I got to taste the local food along the way. The guides were knowledgable, patient and thoughtful. We were running late for the tour ('cos I joined in late), they didn't rush through it and they would ask if we need toilet break.The best highlight of the tour was the sushi at a sushi restaurant nearby Tsukiji market - the sushi was really yummy and what's best is it didn't require long queue (: Thanks Yu (and Tae)!"

Don't miss this event besides the other tour they do offer (experiencing local food)."

I would not have managed to go through the complicated maze of the inner market. I got to see the big fresh tunas, snow crabs, eels, shrimp, oysters and fruits and veggies. Yu guided me to the hidden secrets of the market as well as the the best food the locals go for. I didn't need to line up for 5hrs for the best sushi. Yu showed me where the locals eat. Even if it wasn't in the menu, he gladly offered me my favorite uni sushi. I highly recommend this food tour. He goes beyond what is expected. He even gave me pamphlets and Tokyo guides to help me during the rest of my stay. Yu-san is the perfect host.I will definitely tell my friends to take his tour."

We got to taste such a variety of foods, saw an auction and so many fish/vegetables/produce/everything possible under the sun, for sale. Our guide was funny, entertaining and full of local knowledge and also so very kind as to take some great photos of us both together, sending them to us later that day. Truly the best value and time spent. Highly recommend doing it this way! It was amazing!"
