We toured the botanical garden, which is free. We toured the Japanese Garden, which cost $70 pesos or roughly $4 USD. It was a lovely garden but the best part was the crepe stand inside the garden. The crepes are rolled up like an ice cream cone. We had salmon, veggies, chicken and for dessert we shared a banana and chocolate crepe. That was amazing!We took a short carriage ride to get an overview of the park and then we rented bicycles. We had some trouble finding them so maybe I can save you some time. If you start at Plaza Italia and walk straight up Avenida Sarmienta, go straight to Avenida Figueroa Alcorta and turn left. There is a truck with lots of bikes, roller blades and multiperson bikes. There is a guy selling food across the road from the bikes. You pay him, you need to leave some kind of ID, and then you get the bikes. $100 pesos for one hour. The road was closed to traffic, not sure if that is everyday or just because it was a holiday. It was mobbed with bikes, rollerblades, dogs, walkers, skateboards. It was crazy and I was sure that someone would crash and we had some close calls but it was an experience. People were everywhere! We had a great day at the park!"

The \"Rosedal\" is very nice with some incredible array of roses (best time during Sept/Oct). There are also several places to eat that reopened a few months ago. Highly recommended."

We were there early March and the roses were in the midst of their bloom. Not as many variety as one might expect but enough to make sure your walk through the garden is interesting. The little lake in the middle of the park lends a cooling feeling on a hot day! Lots of statues around the park - just understanding who they are will take a few hours!"

The place is very well-maintained, it has benches and pergolas and all in all it provides a great retreat from the hastle of the city life. There are loads of roses of different colours and some other beautiful flowers. The best time to visit, in my opinion, is the second part of November and December when all the roses are in blossom and you can also see the lilac flowers of jacaranda trees. In the lakes circling the gardens there are numerous geese with their goslings (November). The garden is great for pictures. It's free, closed on Mondays, open Tuesday to Sunday 9am-6pm (in summer"

Walking made us notice things we would have otherwise missed.The park complex is very large and well maintained and in it to one side is the rose garden.Plantings are in colours and they are well groomed and healthy. Massed roses in bloom are a spectacular display,many are perfumed and visitors are treated to this garden in springflowering. The grass in the park surrounding the rose gardens is off limits and signs ask visitors to keep off the grass. Very strange to have this limitation in a public park. This is the only downside in a beautiful tourist attraction."

Located in the green Bosques de Palermo park, the garden boasts some 1,200 varieties of roses and more than 15,000 bushes in total. While at El Rosedal, stroll the Rose Garden Walk, take in the Garden of Poets or simply relax on one of the many park benches available for your comfort throughout the garden.

Another treat is when they have SONIDOS en Rosedal and Sunday concerts. We adore them and it's truly mingling with the locals. Need to check the gov't website....I honestly can't remember the month and there certainly was NOT a concert today.As I do this, my mind's eye can recall the aroma of those terrific roses.

The Rosedal is in Palermo Woods, its a big space where you can see hundreds of types of Roses, the place is quiet and perfect for an afternoon walk. It is pretty well preserved and the views of the city from the Rosedal are also great. Do not take a taxi directly to El Roseda, because the drivers will do some tricky rides to get more money. Just take a taxi to Palermo Woods, once there you can walk to el rosedal while also enjoying the Woods which are pretty cool as well."

On the outer part, by the lake, is a popular running track, where people also roller blade, cycle and excersise, the Sivori art Museum (often free), and some vendors selling choripan and other snacks and drinks.When I lived across the street from there, I went almost every day.Highly recommended - easy bus access."

There are decent public restrooms and vendors to get drinks and snacks from. We were also here on a Monday that was a national holiday and as you would expect at any major city park on a holiday when the weather forecast is sunny with a high of 80 degrees, it was crowded but not to the point that it seemed overcrowded. I am not a huge fan of crowds but it's a big park and at the time we were there, there plenty of space for us and others to enjoy and relax. However, if you are worried about crowds, avoiding weekends and holidays, especially ones with excellent weather forecasts is probably a good idea. Regardless of when you go, it's a great place to spend a few hours or the day."

Finally we came to a monument 'Monum. de Los Espanoles' and not far we reached the Paseo del Rosedal. But it was closed.

We enjoyed our visit so much that we hopped in a Taxi from our Palermo/Recoleta apartment and returned again about a week later to enjoy again and spend more time at a leisurely pace. Our visit was in October when everything was nicely covered with flowers. We go to Bs.As nearly every year in October as it is Spring down there at this time of year. Sometimes we have enjoyed visits in March-April as it is Fall then and also nice weather. We always rent an apartment in the Palerma/Recoleta area is it is so much more comfortable than a hotel.

Most of this gardens was once part of the huge residence of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a \"caudillo\" who governed Buenos Aires Province (whose capital was then the homonymous city) with iron hand in the first half of the XIX century, and was afterwards exiled in England. It's said that because his family name means \"roses\" in Spanish, those flowers were afterwards cultivated here, when the place became public. Others maintain that the caudillo himself had imposed the mode, not devoid of his well known anglophilia. Today, this great gardens, with a lake (boats available) and monuments, make a nice and peaceful strolling moment for an afternoon, once the more intensive touring activities are concluded."

Located in the center of the Bosque de Palermo, Rosedal is absolutely gorgeous. I was so surprised at the amount of roses still in bloom in the garden even as Buenos Aires' fall turns to winter. This is an excellent place to have a picnic, go on a jog, or just take a stroll. There are ducks and geese everywhere so if you have little ones, bring some bread or something to feed them. It was such a tranquil place to go to and you are bound to enjoy it. Also make sure to bring a camera because there are plenty of places to take pictures!"

Beautifully maintained throughout the years, it is a place to enjoy not only nature and pure air but also art, as it has several artworks: statues and busts of famous international artists are spread allover the place. Leaving aside technical aspects, it is a peaceful, more than agreable place, with fantastic views, a nice lake to rent a boat and row (with your hands as traditionally or your legs on pedals), an Hellenic bridge, an Andalusian patio donated by the city of Seville (Spain) and the wonderful smell of roses.

It is comprised of over 3 hectares and YPF can be credited for its restoration and upkeep. Of its 18,000 rose plants, 5,000 were planted in 2008 by YPF. Enclosed within the rose garden is a special area for the New Roses. Several roses also have their awards displayed next to them. Monuments are dispersed among the area including over 20 busts of poets and writers. Around the fountain are several signs in both Spanish and English describing the sculptures, listing the names of the busts, etc. A bridge leads to a small island with bamboo that is only accessible via that bridge. The beautiful lake adds to the picturesque vision of this special space."

I went back a couple of days later to take pictures and hang out. Had I been staying closer, I would have gone more. It was beautiful! Many people about but still felt peaceful. The whole park system within which the Rose Garden sits is great for a day of chilling out in a green space without leaving Buenos Aires."

As I live in Buenos Aires for almost a year now, and have visited the city severel times before - I have been to Palermo, and \"Paseo del Rosedal\" many times, as it is one of our favorite places in Bs.As. Even though we have to travel 1,5 hours to get there we do it often.It is a wonderful area, all year, but of course if you specificly go for the roses, then summer is the best time. I have been there 2 times in January 2012, and the atmosphere and the roses at spectacular. Everything is kept in a very nice way, and it is spot where you can soak in peace and quiet while your eyes are spoiled with colours and scents.Bring your own food and drinks for a picknic or buy some at the many places where they offer. You can rent rollers, bikes, etc. if you want to be active or just watch all the people who come there to excersice. The Paseo del Rosedal is a park which is a part of the big park complex in Palermo.It is a MUST VISIT for all tourists in this great city, no matter in which way you want to \"use\" it...:-))There are a lot of bus lines which reaches the area, so it is easy to go.Enjoy.........you will love it."

Go for a walk or run. Bring everything you need and organize a pic-nic, or buy a few things at the local kiosk and eat and drink anywhere on the grass. and last but not least, visit the museum overlooking the lake, it is a tiny museum with a lovely coffee place in the inner patio."

Weekends are more crowded, better to get there early because it gets really packed on the loop and you can run into bladers, families, etc. There are 4 or 5 different people renting rollerblades. Take a walk around and check them out to see who has the best skates. None of them are great, but they are functional and cheap, like 4 or five dollars per hour. There are people playing roller hockey, lovers strolling through the bridges and pergolas, and tons of futbol (soccer) games."

It was a 20 minute walk, along some busy avenues, until we arrived in a gorgeous wooden bridge that goes over a portion of the lake, and then takes you to the Rosedal. We were stunned by the quantity and variety of roses, the beautiful colors, the beautiful design of the garden, and the tranquility of the place. It's excellent for a romantic stroll, for photo enthusiasts, or just to spend a lazy afternoon reading a book. I highly recommend it."
