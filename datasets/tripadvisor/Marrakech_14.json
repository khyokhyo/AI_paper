I was nervous about this but you really do have a much more authentic experience. Me and my husband went and for around \u00a323 each had a wash with Moroccan spiced soap a scrub hair wash and shower (oriental hammam =250 dirham). Felt so so clean and was doused in rose oil which smelled amazing! We were taken to a quiet relaxation room and was served water mint tea and pastries. A fantastic place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the souks! It did take us an hour to find it but we did get lost! Take a map and persevere! A wonderful haven! Thank you Nadia and the team especially the lady on reception who gave us directions to get back - we made it!"

            "review": "Enjoyable, but could be better. We had a reservation at this hammam at 10AM. We booked couples hammam and a massage. The place is beautifully designed and people seemed to be pleasant enough, but the hammam itself was quite cold. We've been to many hammams before, and it was definitely not the right temperature. It wasn't freezing, but it was barely warm enough. We blamed it on our early reservation and figured maybe we should have came in later. The scrub was nice, but the glove was really rough, my husband felt like the hammam lady was going to rip his skin off. But the massage was really enjoyable. Don't expect a deep tissue, in our experience most of Moroccan hammams do a nice, relaxing oil massage. We didn't feel rushed, like other reviewers pointed out, but the place was empty that early in the day, so we could relax and enjoy."

            "review": "Welcome to the fast-food of hammam. Normally I only like to write good reviews, but I need to inform you that this establishment is unworthy of praise. The reason I give two stars is because the place was clean and had nice ambiance.My group of four made a reservation for a traditional hammam and 30 minute massage for each of us ($500 drhm each). Bottom line, the whole thing was extremely rushed and the massage was poor. The water poured over us (typically hot) was just slightly warm and in the room there was no steam. After washing they had us sit in a room (while we were still wet) and drink tea. This would have been more appropriate at the end of the whole experience (how it is typically done elsewhere). The \"massage\" was a rushed slathering of oils. When we asked for more pressure the massage was done more quickly. We all were left still oiled up after the whole experience. They offered to let us shower at the end, but in a small smelly shower at the end of the hall. When I politely tried to suggest how the experience might have been improved the desk staff interrupted me and became defensive.As I said, at least the building was nice and was seemingly clean."

I am a regular visitor to Marrakech (once or twice every year) and always make it a priority to treat myself to a visit to Hammam de la Rose for a hammam and massage treatment during my stay. The staff make you feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door and always look professional in their immaculate green tunic uniforms. I can highly recommend one of their special packages which include a hammam session followed by a full body massage - 'Ceremony of the Rose' and the new package, 'Tour of Morocco' are both excellent. Between the hammam and massage there is a short break when water, mint tea and a small sweet treat are provided in a quiet lounge area. For me personally, Jamila provides the best hammam session so I always make sure to book an appointment when she is available. Jamila gives a very thorough body wash and scrub with a special mitt which makes my skin feel wonderful and refreshed afterwards. I will be back to see you again in 2017. Thank you from Carole"

I think one would be better off doing a local hamman for 50 dhms. Even if they charge you double, it might still be a better option. The local price is 30 dims for the hamman and 20 for the scrub."

We had just arrived in Marrakech so it is the best way to unwind and really get into the mood of rest and relaxation.

We received the attention and service we expected. The Hammam was a block from the taxi stop but had a clear sign so easy to find in the craziness of the medina.We were greeted in English where they explained everything. We were taken to our change rooms and changed into the disposable underwear provided and a robe with slippers. Then we were off to the Hammam. It was a very relaxing experience in the warm water with a 15 min or so pause to relax in the steam. The Hammam seemed pretty basic as far as application of oils and such which was fine for me.Once done I was taken to a waiting area and served cookies, water and their mint tea which had some extra herbs. After a brief wait I was off to a massage which was also relaxing- they hit the main pressure and sore points. Then it was back to the waiting area for more cookies and team while I waited for my better half to complete her treatment. When we were ready we were taken back to change and head back to the medina. I found the overall experience very peaceful compared to everything outside. If anything, they left us alone longer than I would expect but it seemed geared to our speed. I recommend this Hammam as a great way to unwind while in Marrakech."

Attentive and pleasant staff in a well kept and clean spa made it 5* for me. The only reason for a 4* is the massage that followed was more a rub than a true massage. (Having been to many Asian standard massages we've perhaps come to expect too much of this place. I understand massage is not really culturally native to Moroccans so I guess it may be unfair to expect too much.) Overall, very very good experience and glad my guide had recommended it."

I had the sublime massage and was going to pay also for a foot massage but they said there was no need as the massage also incorporated a foot massage (which was only about 1 minute a foot).The massage was a little light so I asked for it to be harder and they said it would be 50dh extra as it was an Ayurvedic massage! What a rip off. The therapist was a little blunt too. The receptionist was nice. The massage was relaxing but not sure if it really went for my tense points. I had a manicure and pedicure which was very nice but it would have been nice to have a hand/foot massage incorporated. The experience was okay overall but it may have been just as good somewhere cheaper."

            "review": "Poor treatment in beautiful setting. The spa itself is beautiful, but the treatment very disappointing indeed. I had read a couple of negative comments on Trip Advisor, but the majority were very positive, so we decided to give it a go. My girlfriend and I have both had many Hammams in Morocco, and I am sad to say that this was one of the very worst. The therapists were disinterested, and very unengaged, they slapped on the soap, mud, or whatever as quickly as possible, with no focus or care, and then left us to \u201crelax\u201d seemingly as quickly as they possibly could. We both speak English and French (I note the response from the Hammam below about the therapists not speaking English) and I can tell you that they are just as curt and unfriendly in French.It was the lack of attention that was the worst aspect though, both if us had therapist who just didn\u2019t seem to care about what they were doing, or about us, they just slapped on the treatments as quickly as possible, not covering all the flesh by any means, then walked out. We are both used to hammams in which the treatment is given by someone who appears at least to care - the lotions are applied with care and focus, all the skin is covered.We had the top of the range hammam, supposedly 50 mins. The therapists were with us for about 15 mins at most. The treatment was supposed to end with a foot massage, that lasted about 90 seconds, and was little more than a quick rub of the knuckles along the sole.When we complained afterwards, the front desk explained that the long gaps (15 or 20 mins just lying in the Hammam) were so that the treatments could take effect - this is just about acceptable for the mud, but hardly for the initial soap application, which just gets sticky and itchy. Then we were instructed to wash ourselves under the shower (twice) whereas in every other hammam either of us has experienced the therapist does the rinsing, that\u2019s part of the ritual! At the end, when asked what we thought, we were honest. The front desk staff were very defensive (as I see \u201cthe management\u201d is on the negative comments below) they made excuses, but offered us a 10% discount, which took the price down from 900DIR to 810DIR, a lot more than the treatment was worth in my opinion.There is also a strange comment from \u201cmanagement\u201d below that Trip Advisor is a place to share recommendations of good experiences only - no, Trip Advisor is about sharing all experiences, positive or negative. My own feedback is usually very positive, as I am careful to go to hotels, restaurants, etc. endorsed by others on Trip Advisor. On this occasion I saw some negative feedback, but hoped our experience would be in line with the vast majority of positive feedback. Sadly it was not, and I cannot recommend this spa. I hope that given the significant numbers of negative comments, the management will try to improve the attitude and quality of its therapists, rather than just being defensive. You have excellent promises, now make sure you therapists and treatments live up to that standard."

Friendly when I made a reservation with 'a kind request to cone 10 minutes before the appointment.' Since the hammam is located in the labyrinth of the Medina, and I am just a tourist, I decided not to take any risk in getting lost and by accident I arrived 15 min earlier.No problem. At the counter I decided to book an extra massage, which resulted in a total amount of 700 dh.for 90 minutes.It was a bad mistake. An uncaring 6 minute scrub, a 1 minute shampoo including conditior filled with 50 minutes left alone 'for relaxation purposes'. I questioned this 3 times, without an adequate answer. After they told me to relax on a huge white sofa with a glas of mint tea, 1 biscuit and 250 ml water whilst waiting for the massage, I decided to step out of this shameful and ridiculous priced experience. I had to pay 400 dh for just 20 minutes actual hammam attention. They did not care at all about my complaints and discomfort. 'This is Moroccan style hamman. Sorry that you do not appreciate the relaxation time. Not That will be 400 dh please.'Don't go there! They just want to make a lot of money for a lousy service. They can, because they are only getting 1 time customers: tourists who believe the positive reviews."

Booked the Ceremony of the Rose package on my last day in the city, which was the perfect way to spend a late afternoon being pampered after two days on an excursion to the desert and wandering around the souks. I had the hammam first followed by a relaxing massage which involved the best foot massage ever! My massage therapist spent at least 10 minutes on each foot and it was a real treat. The oils were beautifully scented and relaxing. This spa is just so beautiful, as soon as you enter you feel like you\u2019ve been transported somewhere else, such a sanctuary within the busy souks \u2013 is a bit difficult to locate but as soon as you enter you forget all about that! You are provided robes and slippers, all your belongings can be stored and locked away safely in their lockers. The hammam was an experience but the team is so friendly and professional that you feel instantly comfortable and relaxed. After the hammam I was taken to a relaxing lounge area and served snacks before I was taken to have my massage. A great experience and I would definitely recommend this place, the setting is so beautiful, creating a tranquil sanctuary as soon as you step inside. A modern set up but a traditional and mystical hammam setting and one of the best massages I\u2019ve ever experienced."

When taken to the room, the lady spoke very little english and did not explain the procedure. I was rubbed in some soap and pointed to sit down in the sauna. With no explanation, I wasn't sure how long I would be left alone. About fifteen minutes later, she came back and came a lazy scrub/head wash - so little, that I actually decided to scrub the product in more myself.In addition to the hammam, I also had a Orange Blossom facial (30 minutes) which was mediocre. Again, same thing - i was given a scrub and left for five minutes and then same with mask - the massage must have lasted about 3 minutes. Out of the 1hour 30 minutes, most of the time was spent alone and not with my therapist and having paid around \u00a355 for this, I was left feeling ripped off.I think next time, I'd rather go to a cheaper, local 'authentic' one."

They make sure we are hydrated enough during the hammam and fresh mint tea waits for us at the end of the massage.I have a lot of spa deals before but this definitely is on top of the list.Definitely recommending this to everyone as a to do in Marakkech."

The staff were really lovely and it was honestly the best massage ever. Nice touches with lockers, all very clean, robes and slippers provided, tea and refreshments provided between treatments and all very professional but also very friendly at the same time. Would definitely recommend coming here, but maybe worth booking in advance as they are very popular."

The massage therapists are some of the best I've encountered, anywhere, and the atmosphere is relaxing and serene. I'd never considered this but given a fellow visitor raised it, and seemed rather perturbed, it may be worth stating ( the obvious) A traditional Hamman treatment involves stripping off your kit ( bar a tiny pair of disposable underwear)and being scrubbed down and oiled up. Fine by me but my fellow client had not expected this stating: that's not how they do it at my spa in Cheshire. Well it's not a spa and it's not Cheshire. But yes for those not comfortable with a full on all over body scrub, avoid. You'd be missing out but each to their own. "

Hammam experience was very interesting, but very private, the stuff is highly professional and would let you know what is the procedure. The massage was pleasant as well.

The changing area is good and you are provided with everything you need. We had chosen the anti stress treatment. The steam room is stunning. Everywhere is clean and it really feels like a high quality sort of place. I did feel like the Hammam side of things was rather rushed - the soaps and oils were quickly slapped on and one of the ladies seemed a bit miserable and didn't smile at all. We were taken to a very comfortable waiting area afterwards and given mint tea, a cookie and water which was a nice touch. The massage received was very good, I enjoyed mine - the only criticism my daughter had was that her masseuse had very smelly feet! Afterwards we had a shower which isn't always offered so we didn't have to go home with oily hair. Overall I think this is a lovely place to visit and I recommend it however I wouldn't visit again as there are many many Hammams all over Marrakech and I have had better hammams at cheaper places but not with the high end luxury of Hammam de la Rose."

From the moment you step through the doors it's like you've escaped to another city, the craziness of the medina and souks are quickly forgotten. I had booked for a 30min hammam followed by a 30min massage, both of which were lovely. All of the therapists I came across were extremely professional and went out of their way to ensure you were comfortable and enjoying the treatment. The small touches of having someone to walk you between rooms and giving you the hammam glove to keep didn't go unnoticed. Care was also taken to create a clean, relaxing environment, everything was brand new (no reused robes) and the products high quality, all of which smelt amazing. I would definitely recommend a visit when in Marrakech."

We booked a hammam followed by a 1 hour massage in a bid to remove some of the stress the hustle and bustle that Marrakech will inevitably place on you, and it definitely worked!This was our first Hammam so we don't have anything to compare it to, but it was definitely very good. Inside was spacious, clean and smelled great. The girls were professional, talkative and knew what they were doing. They washed you from tip to toe, scrubbed you down with a black scrubby sponge thing and lathered you up with all kinds of potions, which smelled superb. The massage was also very good, probably the best I've had. I was more than ready to go to sleep afterwards but we had a flight to catch later that evening so it wasn't possible. There are so many spas/hammams in Marrakech and you're probably thinking I have no clue which one to choose. There may be ones better than this, but if you spend the next hour trying to find one, you'll just stress yourself out more. This one is honestly very good so just book it. They also have a roof terrace for relaxing which was a nice touch."

I went to this Hammam, last week, when we were in Marrakech for only 2 days.Mariyam, and her colleagues at reception are well dressed, very smartly dressed actually. They are professional and welcomed us upon arrival with lovely smiles. I booked by email in advance but the night before, I realised I had booked the incorrect time for us, I emailed to change it to the evening and they were most accommodating, another sign of great customer service here!Hammam De La Rose is the 3rd Hammam, I have been to in Marrakech and by far the best. This is the very best Hammam, as yet and I highly recommend it. There are a few reasons for this:It is clean (I'm a germaphobe and found it clean!) from the changing rooms to the actual bathing area, the actual Hammam, to the massage rooms to the lovely neutral relaxation room at the end.I liked everything about this Hammam, granted it costs more than say, Hammam Ziani ( never again, that place is filthy, dirty, gross and having gone there when I was in Marrakech last, I will never go there again!) but there is a simple reason for this - quality of service and overall better experience.The staff are super friendly, in all departments, they are lovely and walk you around from Dept to dept respectfully. This is a nice personal touch.We both went for their 500mad = \u00a337, Package, a 50minute long package, which included, Hammam, scrubbing and a 20 or 30 minute massage. no payment was taken until minutes before we left, Unlike Hammam Ziani and Hammam Hilton, they both charged upfront, last time I was in Morocco and provided awful service. Please avoid those Hammam's. This very fact that they do not charge you until the end, shows they are a qualityThe scrubbing is awesome, the lady who did so for me, was very thorough and left me with Glowing, simply gorgeous baby soft skin all over. If you are a Brit like me, And a tad fragile, who may not be used to the pressure, you can ask them to be gentle and they will happily oblige. I however chose to close my eyes, clenched my fists and bear it. My skin has never felt so good before.After you have been bathed, you are given the glove they scrub you with as a souvenir, wrapped in plastic. How lovely, I brought mine back to Britain and in my bathroom, only my John Lewis natural bristle body brush which cost over \u00a310 is of better quality than this. It is branded Hammam De La Rose too, this shows they are proud of their brand. I was then given my gown and waved goodbye, the door opened and another woman was stood there in uniform with a cute little bottle of water for me, it was ice cold mineral water. Again another nice touch.Then I was taken to the massage area, the massage was ok. After this, the masseuse asked me if I wished to shower and I said yes. The shower area was lovely, the shower itself, rain water style big head was amazing, the water pressure was fabulous. Like a jet spray. On a shelf nearby were 3 big bottles, gorgeous argan oil shampoo, conditioner and body lotion for customers to use. The aroma of these inspired me to buy some to take home to Britain.After my shower, I was then shown where the relaxation room was, where they brought us mint tea and little biscuits. We sat there chatting for 10minutes or so and then changed and left, feeling super relaxed and completely reenergised!I forgot to add, right at the start, they give you clean robes (I stressed clean here, as at both Hammam Hilton and Ziani, I was clearly given someone's / multiple persons used robe / gown to use!! I could actually see different coloured hair on the robe at Ziani, some long some very short, I dread to imagine which part of the body that hair was from.....euwwwww, gross) they were freshly laundered with no marks, you are also given clean cloth slippers and disposable underwear. Upon finishing your treatment, a hair brush and hairdryer is there and ready to use in he changing room and bins to dispose of your gown, disposable underwear and slippers.I really wish them success and hope there are many Hammam De La Rose's, a chain of them soon. I so look forward to returning to Marrakech, This is the only Hammam I'll be going to. Thank you all at Hammam De La Rose."

It was amazing being pampered for so long and it was so relaxing, you could feel all the tension just melting away. You are provided with everything you need - disposable briefs, slippers and a gown. As a side note - all staff are females in this establishment so regardless of whether you are male or female, a female member of staff will carry out your treatment.To give a brief overview of the 'Tour of Morocco' - we were shown to a private locker where you get changed into your disposable briefs and a gown and we were then shown to a relaxation area where we had pastries and mint tea (a perfect bonus!). We then proceeded with the hammam which is basically like a sauna. After a short time we were exfoliated with a number of different and beautifully smelling creams and scrubs. We also got to keep the exfoliating mitt as a present. A quick but thorough foot rub was given and we were then shown to another room with some more mint tea and pastries and soon after we were shown to a room where we were massaged (the whole body, back and front) with argan oil which was so beautiful. I can remember feeling totally reborn after leaving. I would definitely recommend! I was so soft for so long!"

To give you a brief run-down of events, firstly you are shown into a private changing area where you strip down and place your clothes and belongings in a locker. Paper underwear is provided, but I chose to wear my bikini bottoms for the treatment...no top half, but the spa session is private so you don't need to feel self-conscious!All necessities such as robes, slippers, towels are provided.After putting on your robe (you carry the locker key with you in the pocket) you are led to a waiting area before being called up to the treatment rooms. The ladies did not speak fluent English, but give you clear instructions on what to do. A hammam involves sweating it out in a steam room before being covered in soap and vigorously scrubbed down with a mitt. My skin still feels baby soft four days after! You're then led to to waiting area and given mint tea and water before being called in for the massage. It was mine and my partner's first time getting a massage, and it was great to feel all the stress getting worked out of your back and shoulders. One you've finished you're given the opportunity to shower and dry your hair before changing and settling the bill.We left feeling amazing and would recommend this spa to anyone."

From the moment we walked in it's doors, we were greeted with exceptional care, kindess + professionalism. My boyfriend + I had the Imperial Hammam for two (400 dirhams each=$40 USD) + were treated to a thorough dousing of warm water while we sat on relaxing hot slabs of marble (so great for your back), followed by an intense scrubbing (gommage) that removed layers of skin that you'll not believe. Then after we were treated to the luxurious black eucalyptus soap which opened up the pores + lungs, further aiding in the detox of all the food + wine we'd indulged in. The final steps were rhassoul, the nourishing black mud along with a fragrant shampoo + shower in orange blossom scented bath gel. Our muscles were on the verge of jello by that point + we were treated to a quick massage of traditional rose oil before donning our robes once again. We somehow managed to crawl up the stairs to the luxurious lounge where tea + cookies + bottled water awaited + we snoozed + breathed in the relaxation until someone told us we could do the same on the sun lounges up on the rootop terrace. We climbed one more flight + found ourselves asleep on the roof, without ever feeling rushed to leave or move on. Jamila was the technician who took care of us + she was funny, despite our limited French + Arabic. She knew exactly what we needed as we were both first timers in the Hammam + she could NOT have been nicer. I look forward to going back for a good scrubbing once I'm in Marrakech again."

To be honest, I am not used to going to spa so for me, the treatment felt quite indulgent, but I guess that is the point. I had an Imperial Hammam which not only left me feeling indulged but also very tranquil, squeaky clean and with incredibly soft hair that smelt great.I have nothing else to compare this to, so based purely on friendliness of the staff, enjoyment and squeaky cleanness, I would recommend Hammam de la Rose."

I would go back to this place if i ever went to marrakech again, but i cant say i want to return as it was a stressful place, hamman de la rose eases that stress, and there is a beautiful riad/hotel very nearby on the opposite side. if i went to marrakech, i go for a weekend, stay in the hotel opposite, and go to the spa again!"

Lit primarily by candles - the walls and floor were decorated with green and blue iridescent tiles - and it smelled heavenly. We were brought into the sauna room where we were doused with warm, scented water and then rubbed down with the black soap and left to relax for a while. My partner went first for the scrub, before I went they made sure to change the dressing of the platform where the scrub happened and thoroughly rinse the whole area. The order was approximately as follows:-douse again with warm water-vigorous, full body scrub with an exfoliating glove-rinse with warm water-rub with orange scented scrub-relax in the sauna again for a bit-rinse with warm water-soap up body and shampoo (amazing caramel scented argan shampoo that we actually bought a bottle of)-rinse under a rain water type shower-condition hair and rinse againAfter this, we felt marvelous and couldn't believe we still had a massage after! While they were preparing our massages we were led into another beautiful room with deep couches and sunlight filtering in. We were brought hot mint tea, small almond cookies, and cool bottles of water - which was perfect.The massages after were very good as well! They offered us a shower after to remove the massage oil - but we declined it and went on our way smelling like orange blossoms and caramel =)"

The ambient is certainly very nice, clean and new. The service is nothing special. The prices are high so I was expecting much more. I opted for hammam plus relaxing massage. The first one was too quick, I didn't even realised what was going on. The beauty therapists didn't speak any English so fairly impossible to communicate. She was such in a rush to put one finger in my nose (by accidental mistake obviously ) which started bleeding immediately. I didn't complaint because I know it can happen. However this was the cherry on the top at the end of a disappointing hammam. The massage after that was performed by another person. Nothing to declare about it. It was very basic and in the meantime I was thinking about an alternative spa to visit.Finally the place is fine but doesn't worth the price at all."

It is shown on many tourist maps. It is a place for visitors as it is not the usual locals hamman. The place is spotless and so relaxing from the moment you enter. I paid 500 MDR ( about \u00a335) for a wonderful experience. ( 30 mins hamman and 30 mins massage) although there is no clock watching and I think the massage was certainly longer. The staff ( all female) were excellent."

Hammams have heated walls and are usually next to a bakery - do some research and it will help understanding the whole ethos of a Hamman. This place is at the top of the Medina and easy to find. Jemillia was the lady who so expertly exfoliated and treated me. It is a great place to relax in the fun chaos of Marrakech. You only need yourself as everything else is provided for you in a calm and relaxing atmosphere - everyone should treat themselves to a Hammam here."

Everything was very good explained by the receptionist and even gave us a small tour in the building. Next day we went back. We were taken to seperate dressing rooms to get changed. Here you had your own locker to put your clothes and stuff in. In the locker was underwear to wear, a bathrobe and slippers. Then we were taken to the hammam. This was an hour. after the hammam we had tea and cookies, before we had an hours massage. This was really an hour, not 50 or 55 minutes. After the massage there is the possibility to relax on the rooftop, have a shower or get changed. We really enjoyed it. It was continiously just the two of us. Very professional."

I had a massage, waxing and pedicure and and a package that included a massage and traditional hammam.As soon as you enter the place the quality and tranquility is evident. Once through reception the lights are dimmed and the decor beautiful with cool, relaxing but colourful smooth tadelakt and drapes everywhere.Hygiene and cleanliness are paramount. All towels, gowns and slippers are provided and you can leave your belongings securely. You are given your body scrub glove to take home after the hammam. Mint tea, water and traditional biscuits are offered between treatments in a lovely chamber bathed in coloured light.The hammam is thorough and a pleasant experience (though I also enjoy the more rough and ready public hammams!). The two full-body massages I had were professionally-done with a selection of oils, good facilities and unhurried service, checking for feedback throughout. I can certainly recommend Fatima-Zara and (not sure of the spelling) Naima.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a luxury spa treatment at a really quite reasonable price for the care and attention you receive. Booknig is easy, with staff who speak several languages. Emails receive swift, prompt and warm attention. Gratuities are shared evenly among all the staff, which I thought was a nice touch since the cleaner is just as deserving of your appreciation as the masseur."

My friend and I visited the rose hammam on recommendation of a friend and after reading the positive reviews on Tripadvisor we were looking forward to our visit, however we were extremely disappointed.While the receptionist was polite, the lady in the hammam was not at all friendly and after leaving us alone in the hammam without knowing how long we were waiting, proceeded to talk to her friend in quite a loud voice in the hallway and so the experience was not at all relaxing. After being washed and laying down to relax on the beds the lady then continued to sit on the floor in view of us and talk to her friend. My friend and I were extremely shocked by this unprofessional behaviour and thus the experience was not relaxing.We had booked for a 50 minute massage after the hammam and having been 40 minutes in the hammam (there was a clock outside) I was aware they may reduce our massage time as the full package was 90 minutes and we were to then have mint tea. We relaxed with tea and biscuits which was pleasant before going through for a massage. I asked the masseuse what the time was and she said she did not know with a smile, I saw a timer set to 51 minutes but she did not set it despite reassuring me my session was 50 minutes. I cannot fault the massage as it was fantastic however I was sure it was not 50 minutes and when I asked the lady she said it was. We were shown to the terrace where I again asked the time, the lady disappeared to look and returned to inform us it was 5pm. My friend and I felt it was quite late and she too agreed her massage did not seem to be 50 minutes.After relaxing for 20 minutes we returned to the changing room and checked out phone to see the time was 5.02, meaning the lady lied to us deliberately about the time, being only too aware that our massage could not have been longer than 30 minutes.When paying I informed the lady on the front desk and she did not seem at all surprised, she merely reduced our payment by 10%, however for \u00a345 in Marrakech I would expect a much higher service with a full 50 minute massage.Needless to say we will not be recommening this hammam."

You are provided with robes, slippers and disposable underwear so you don't really need to bring anything with you which is ideal as we had spent the morning sight seeing. They also have lockers for your valuables. We had a hammam to ourselves and the whole spa environment at de la rose is immediately relaxing. They even wash your hair for you! Afterwards we could spend as long as we wanted in the relaxation room where we were given mint tea, water and biscuits.

You change into disposable underwear, both men and women, and get washed and scrubbed. I'm a big boy, and my disposable pants barely covered my bottom. Tbh this sort of thing doesn't really bother me, I'd have gone in naked, but I think I would have scared them for life. My wife was shocked that she had to go topless. But it was only the three of us (staff member, me and my wife) so it didn't bother me. The rub down and was was fab. The lady washing was great fun, she took the Micky out of my bottom purtruding out of my pants, by pulling them down and washing my bum. Very funny. But that aside, it was very relaxing. We went into the chill out room after, and I went fast asleep, and snored. Great. You have to go here. Don't be tempted to try the others, there not as good.Thank you"

It was basically a 40 minute process of sitting in the heated hammam for 8 or so minutes. Followed by having bowls of water thrown over your head and body then being scrubbed with an exfoliating glove and black soap, rinsed, and then showered. Then your hair was washed with delicious caramel smelling shampoo, rinsed, towel dried and then your skin moisturised with Caramel scented moisturiser. Finished off by a mint tea and almond biscuits. The front of desk girl spoke very good English and was friendly. The girl administrating the scrub was courteous but gave basic instructions...sit, lay, shower.We found the experience enriched our Marrakech stay and we are still having a laugh about the disposable undies.The exfoliating mitt was then included for you to take home.We went here rather than our hotel as it was better priced and conveniently located near our hotel.

Booking process was easy, friendly english-speaking receptionist booked an appointment for the following day. Arrived 5 minutes early as instructed. Was taken into a treatment room and received the most lack-lustre back massage which lasted AT MOST 15 minutes. This consisted of the 'therapist' rubbing my back, hands and hair for about 10 minutes, leaving the room with no explanation, and then returning and telling me to get dressed again.She then seated me in an empty room, gave me some cold mint tea and and once my 30 minute appointment was up, i was told to get dressed. I appreciate that this Hammam is trying to create a relaxing environment, and the decor was characteristically Maroccan, but that doesn't make up for paying 300Dh for an inexcusably bad massage. If you pay for a 30 minute massage, at the very least you expect it to last that long!Maybe their full Hammam package is better, but surely if they offer a back massage, they should be able to provide it."

We booked a couples Celebration of the Rose Hammam and were very excited but had no idea what to expect.I had lots of questions I couldn't find the answer to on here or on their website so I hope this helps:We were able to get a taxi to 300m away from the Door and it was a straight walk so impossible to get lost.Upon entering we were greeted by and English speaking receptionist who checked our booking and welcomed is. They recommend you arrive 10mins early but we were 20mins early and this wasn't a problem.We were each shown into a male and female changing area and given a locker key. Inside the locker there was a bath robe, slippers and a thong paper underwear. This is a piece of material approx 3\" wide and barely covers you front to back, it comes up very high and had a string waistband. I did try it but it was incredibly unflattering and a little uncomfortable therefore I opted to keep my own underwear (pants) on. My boyfriend was given black loose fit shorts to wear.I exited the changing area and was not sure where to wait therefore asked reception and we were shown to a relaxation area where we were given a small bottle of water. After a couple of minutes we were taken for the Hammam. We entered a sauna/steam-room type room, it was very warm and wet but not steamy. Our gowns and slippers were removed and we were given sandals to wear and were shown to padded seats in a round room. The therapist then doused us in warm water covering our whole bodies, rubbed black soap all over us (they will cover every area not covered by underwear, wear a bikini top of you prefer). We were left for 5 mins to relax then it was washed off.One by one we were taken to the next room (I could still see my boyfriend in the next room as it is a seperate section of the room but adjoined). I was asked to lie face down on a padded bed while I my skin was brushed by an exfoliating mitt and my feet with a pumice stone - you get to keep the mitt. I was asked to turn and then sit until my body was fully brushed. Next my hair was washed with a beautiful caramel shampoo and conditioner. The conditioner was left in and my hair tied up. I was given an all over rose mud mask as I stood. It was put on my face which I was worried about as I have extremely sensitive skin but I did not react - a first for me!I was then asked to lie on another padded bed and relax while my boyfriend was called through and given the same treatment.We were then asked to shower it all off, together. Our gowns were put back on and a towel provided for my hair. We were then shown to a relaxing area and given sweetened Mint tea and water. This was lovely. I could feel my body cooling down and relaxing.After 5-10mins we were shown to the room where we would have a massage. We choose an oil and were given the most relaxing and soothing massage I've had. We both absolutely loved it. Ladies - your chest will be massaged, men - your groin is not touched (apparently common in Turkish massages).Afterwards we were asked if we wanted to shower. I wanted to just wash my hair as leaving the oil on my skin would do me good. We were taken into a shower room with a shower, sink and mirror. There was only shower gel here however therefore I used this to wash my hair in the sink.When we finished we were taken downstairs and back to the changing areas.In the changing area there is a sink with brushes and a hairdryer. I had read on here there was a charge to use the hairdryer therefore I didn't bother. There was a rose moisturiser available to use. There was a well lit mirror where I could reapply my make up.After leaving and letting my hair dry in the sun I noticed it was very very oily even although I had washed it (with shower gel). I had to put it up in a ponytail as it was too greasy to leave down.I'd recommend you take pants or a bikini to wear as comfort. If you want to wash your hair afterwards you'll need to take your shampoo/conditioner in your robe pocket with you. It would also be a good idea to remove all make up before the Hammam and wear your hair down so it can be washed and you can get the most out of the head massage. Card is accepted as payment and a few of the therapists ask for a tip which can be slightly awkward.Take a plastic bag to carry home wet underwear/bikini and wet mitt.The staff are all femaleThis was a delightful experience for us both and I'd recommend!The cost was 700dhm per person (approx \u00a350) well worth it."

We pre-booked via email the day before to ensure we got the time/treatment we wanted as we knew the spa was very popular.We arrived around 15minutes before our treatment and were shown straight through to the changing rooms where we were given robes, slippers and disposable underwear. The staff were very polite and friendly, the atmosphere instantly relaxing. We booked in for the hammam and massage package which was 90minutes of pure bliss -refreshing and relaxing. It was an ideal way to relax after the heat and noise of the souks. Our treatment was booked for a late afternoon/early evening meaning the spa was very quiet and we got the relaxation rooms pretty much to ourselves. I would highly recommend a visit...it's well worth the money. "

We ordered the 90 minute Ceremony of the Rose for 70 USD each, which included a 45 minute hammam followed by a brief break for tea and biscuits and then a 50 minute Swedish massage. I had my son with me who was asleep in his stroller. The ladies were so gracious as to put him in a quiet room while we had our treatment. Moroccans adore children and while I asked them to retrieve me if he awoke, they did not and instead played with and entertained him which was really above and beyond the call of duty. The hamman was delightful. Very relaxing and thorough. The massage was relaxing as well but I wouldn't say it was the best massage I've ever received. It was pretty light, not the best technique but still good. The only thing that bothered me about Hammam De La Rose is that they blatantly asked for tips and then they all stood outside the changing room as we dressed. It made me feel awkward knowing they were all there waiting for a handout. While I understand Moroccans make a very low wage and everyone is trying to survive, I paid $140 USD for the treatments and didn't appreciate feeling hawked after. It just left a bad taste at the end of what was a rather enjoyable 90 minutes. I tipped an additional $10 because they essentially baby sat for me and were very kind but they need to tone down the aggressive tip antics. I left the souqs and Jemaa El Fna to get a break from all that!"

I am a regular visitor to Marrakech and since discovering the Hammam de la Rose about 3 years ago, I try to go there at least once on each of my stays in the city. My favourite treatment is the Ceremony of the Rose, which includes the full hammam ritual (body & hair wash and body scrub) then a rose face & body mask, followed by a full body massage. Between the hammam ritual & massage you are taken to a relaxing lounge area and provided with mint tea, biscuits and water. The therapists dress in smart salon uniforms and provide a thoroughly professional service. I always return to the riad feeling nicely scrubbed, massaged and relaxed. I can highly recommend Hammam de la Rose and will look forward to my next visit. Thank you to all the staff there. Carole"

Really isn't anything I can fault them with - greeted with a smile and an English speaking receptionist, quickly served (unfortunately because we didn't book there were no massages available, so I would recommend booking in advance if you wish for one!) and taken to get changed before being taken upstairs into the Hammam. Again, the lady looking after us spoke English to a reasonable standard, made sure we were comfortable at all times. We opted for the full body clay Hammam which we left feeling very relaxed, clean and soft!Upon finishing the Hammam we were taken to a lovely relaxation room and provided with a cold bottle of water and a glass of mint tea - excellent! We were allowed to stay here for as long as we wanted, and so stayed for a good hour!Very clean, very well run Hammam!

However, in common with others I felt that the staff didn't really give us a personalised experience - most likely it was a language barrier as we speak English and our ladies did not. I had to ask for water as even though we were asked to wait before our treatment, nobody had thought we might like some water. Hydration is very important when using steam rooms - mind you we weren't in it for very long! I felt like we were on a conveyor belt with perfunctory scrubs and massages. I was expecting to feel 'scrubbed' clean. The order of the treatments was not explained and we didn't really know what was going on. After our scrub, shampoo and rose mask, we were asked to wait in a room for a while and brought mint tea and a pastry. Then we were called into the massage room. I've had a relaxing massage many times, this was the sort of massage my husband might give - as one other reviewer has said it was more like stroking the skin. Not very relaxing either to have a massage, almost naked at the front of the salon behind a plate glass frosted window and a voile curtain but listening to the sounds of the street the other side of the window. We wanted to relax on the roof terrace after our massage but were directed to get changed and off we went. The owner (?) did ask us how we enjoyed our treatment, my daughter really enjoyed her experience, possibly because she doesn't have massages very often? Anyway, I did not want to complain and spoil my daughter's experience - very few people have the courage to complain in person I think you'll find. I did mention to the manageress before I came in I had a tension knot in my shoulder (the result of getting lost in the souks) which I had asked the masseuse to sort for me. I have had tension knots worked on before and although it is a bit stiff after the massage it usually clears up after a couple of hours and is much better. This didn't. Don't know what she did, but my shoulder was agony for a couple of days. I couldn't even touch it or have the strap of my handbag over that shoulder. I thought the Hammam was expensive for what it was, I didn't feel it was personalised or feel pampered. I've had spa treatments in the UK and the staff here was amateurish in comparison. However, my daughter did enjoy her time here so I've given this an average rating."

As the title suggests, my girlfriend and I had a lovely experience, which I will come back to later, but unfortunately this was tainted when we realised later that evening that'd we'd paid a 200 MAD excess on the flagship 'Ceremony of the Rose' treatment (700 MAD per person - quite a lot for us) because we had not remembered and were not reminded by management that we had already paid a 200 MAD deposit when we booked in person a couple of hours previous. We hope this was human error on part of management (as well as ourselves) and not attributed to something more beguiling as we really do feel this is something they should have been on top of especially when their clients are in a post-hedonistic stupor! That being said, the de la Rose is a well presented, modern hammam - front of house were friendly and the attendants congenial and accommodating. The scrub was thorough and the massage relaxing though we would have liked it a little stronger and deeper. All in all, a worthwhile experience if you have a few MAD to spare but slightly over priced by our estimation and would perhaps recommend one finding a more authentic and traditional alternative.

When we got to the hammam we were quickly asked to take off our robes and then led to the steam room. Once we got there the two girls rudely started to throw bowls of hot water at us. After that, without saying a word, the left the room and we were left, clueless, for something like 30 mins in that crazy-hot steam room. They came back and took us to the other room, where, we were rudely scrubbed and cleansed. It felt like being in a hospital.

This was the first time I have visited a hammam--and while a bit unnerving at first, the staff was professional and very discreet, so it made the experience very relaxing. Following the hammam, I had the BEST massage of my life. Again, very discreet and very professional, and got rid of the all the tension that built up after two days in the Medina. The smells of the oils were amazing, the massage therapist instinctively knew how much pressure to apply, and I left feeling renewed and relaxed. I would highly recommend the Hammam de la Rose for anyone who wants a combination of luxury and a traditional hammam experience. Worth every single penny/pence/durham. They also sell the same products that they use in the hammam--and while a little pricey---bought some to bring home and have not regretted it once. Overall an amazing, luxurious and relaxing experience well worth the visit."

The treatments themselves where amazing, all the soaps and oils used smelt delicious and left our skin feeling great.

I had the. 250D basic hamman which was very good value and lasted about 45 mins altogether. You get a nice white fluffy robe , paper pants and slippers and then are led upstairs. The hamman is very warm which is good as the attendant starts by pouring water over you and then soaping you with the famous black soap. Then you are left in the sauna to sweat out the toxins before being rinsed off and then lying down and beingscrubbed with a mitt . All over. More rinsing, hair washing, soaping follow and then a rain shower. It all smells gorgeous. At the end, in your robe,you go to a quiet room with white sofas and have water and mint tea before getting changed. Great experience, can't wait to do it again."

My wife complained to the massager saying are you not going to give me full massage she said no it's only for back. This was very disappointing we were told that the massage will be for 30 min and will be for full body. When we complained to the manager she just said \"sorry I think the massager did not understand well.\" She gave us a 100 Dhiram refund which was nothing to what we paid. It was a very bad experience to the money we paid for sitting in the steam room. "

The staff in the hammam and massage areas are well qualified again comparable to any US Spa that I have visited.

All the areas were spotlessly clean, the staff was friendly and my massage was just great. Between the Hammam and the Massage we had a quick rest time for tea and cookies. None of the staff who took care of us was pushy for tips.In the changing room there's a hairdryer available but for 100Dirhams you can get a brushing in their hair saloon.Small advice: if you are not happy with the pressure in your massage let the masseur know, otherwise she will not guess, right?"

I was very excited to be going for a traditional hamman and massage and purposely booked something outside of the hotel as we wanted to experience the authentic hamman. I booked for myself and my 2 adult children for the 'Ceremony de la rose' Hamman plus massage. The changing facilities upon entry are very substandard, there is only a flimsy curtain separating customers and passers by and my son by mistake came into the ladies area as he had no idea where he was going. The privacy aspect really needs addressing. We went downstairs together as a family and waited 10 minutes before being taken to the hamman. We were in there far too long without water, I ventured outside and found a member of staff and asked if we could have some water and move on to the next step as we had been sitting in the steam room for 15 minutes.I felt that at each stage of the process we were on a conveyor belt, there was nothing personal about the experience and we were left far too long in between each step to the point where we just wanted to get out. The two ladies who were carrying out the treatment chatted constantly in the area next to the hamman, therefore there was no relaxing atmosphere as one would have hoped for. The massage was very average, it was more like stroking of the skin, not what I would call a proper massage. It was relaxing, how can it not be lying on a hot bed but the therapist appeared very tired and I felt sorry for her. I started wondering how many massages she had carried out during the day and wondered whether she was just worn out. In my opinion this establishment may appeal to those who are not familiar or experienced with hammans and massages in general. For anyone who is used to regular treatments, I think they will be disappointed as we were. There are many more superior spas to visit and we would do further research on our next visit"

The staff are polite and very welcoming when you arrive, and It is advisable to book ahead as this is a very popular and busy spa.Overall? The treatment we had (ceremony of the rose) was relaxing and we certainly felt cleansed afterwards.The downside for me was the actual treatment time. The easiest way to explain this is to walk you through our experience.1) arrive and get changed into the paper g-string (standard for this type of treatment - ladies you will be expected to wear nothing but your paper g-string pouring treatment, again this is standard)2) wait for 10 minutes to be taken to steam room3) into steam room - the wash down and soap application took about five minutes (for two of us)4) left in steam room for around 15-20minutes5) lady returned and then we were scrubbed ( about 5 minutes each) and the rose mask was applied (took less than a minute each)6) left lying down for another 15 mins7) lady returned - we both showered8) taken to a room where we had tea - another 20 minute wait.9) collected by two masseuse and had a massage (30 minutes)10) treatment ends get dressed.The whole experience lasted exactly two hours from arrival to getting dressed at the end. The actual treatment time (ie when the body was being rubbed down or massaged) was less than 45 minutes each, this is despite the treatment being advertised as 90 minutes.So whilst this was a very pleasant experience the time spent on treatment left us feeling a little short-changed. The Hammam was clearly very busy and did have a bit of a \"production line\" feel to it, and the standard of massage was only average compared to other treatments we have had in different countries.If you are looking at this through western eyes the cost is pretty good value compared to European spas..... But when you look at the actual time spent on the treatment (as opposed to lying or sitting around) the pricing is what you would expect in any UK or other European city.Worth a visit.... But keep your expectations in check."

When I told staff about the problem and that they should have mentioned this to me before starting the massage / subsidised the price - their response was that it's not their fault. I would have been fine if they had notified me of the banging before so I knew what I was paying for. 2. Large parts of the 1.5 hours was just sitting around in the spa with 1 min of scrubbing - no real value add on their part. 3. Prices are more than average for this type of place - I'm 100% sure you can get better value for money than this place. The good thing was probably the massage.

The location of this Hammam is great - not so noisy with lots of boutiques of art, handicraft and perfumerie.The service was great - some cookies and traditional tea is included. Great value for the price. We took the Rose treatment, which includes the steam room with scrub, eucalyptus lotion, hair wash with caramel shampoo and balsam and body wash with rose gel. Then some tea and 45 minutes of massage with Argan oil of your choice.If you are very conservative, hammam is not for you - you need to be basically naked (only wear undies) at all times and you will be thoroughly scrubbed, washed, creamed and massaged ALL over."

We all had the ceremony of the rose treatment and it was totally brilliant. The hammam is stylish and classy, the treatment was quite full on (hot, of course, lots of mud clay plastered all over us...while wearing comedy massage paper pants). The women working there were friendly and funny. The massage was one of the best I've ever had and several of our group said the same. Not for shy or bashful people maybe - but if you're looking for a tourist-focused but still partly authentic experience this is a great option."

They came back furious and sad after two hours.The place had no particular character or local colour, and moreover:- skillfully taken photos published on the web were hiding what was in fact a narrow, smallish space;- \" packages\" turned out to be straight-jackets from which you could not deviate;- as to the prices for services themselves, they exceeded those of equivalent establishments in Brussels, whithout providing the professionalism and attention to client needs you would take for granted there.My wife was particularly upset about an amateurishly done eyebrow epilation which she will carry as a memento for the next 7 weeks, each time she is looking into the mirror!Our advice - keep away from this place. There are more typical and cheaper establishments in Marrakech. Alternatively, with the same money you will be getting largely more satisfying services on your high street back home"

I had the hammam which involved having warm water poured over me and to then sit a sauna like room while they cover you in black soap. After sweating it out in there for a while they wash off the soap and then the he exfoliating began. I was then massaged with various lotions and potions while I had an oil massaged into my hair and then that was shampooed and did conditioned. I felt completely relaxed and clean once it was finished. I was then taken to a nice quiet tranquil room and given water and mint tea which was delicious. I will definitely go again if I return to Morocco as this was amazing. Would definitely recommend."

The lady at the desk didn't even try to accommodate my request and stated if they had a male customer arrive whilst I was in the hammam they would let him in. Very disappointing as I'm from London and have always had my request accommodated back home yet in Morocco where I'd heard women only hammams were the norm I was turned down.

Hammam de la Rose is excellent and will suit the luxe traveller that expects and demands a higher standard of massage and general customer experience. Les Bains is awful, and my wife and I had the worst massage we have ever had (and we regularly have massages in London and whenever we go abroad). Hammam de la Rose is the clear winner in all aspects and should be your first choice Hammam/Massage experience in Marrakech. It is very modern and chic, and the hammam experience and full body scrub is very good (although a lot of waiting time in my opinion). The massage was very firm and rejuvenating, unlike Les Bains which was more like a very gentle stroke with the occasional penetration of fingernails into the skin of my back! Very attentive, friendly and smiley staff. Highly recommend."

We did not have to bring anything at all - so there I discovered my bath robe, slippers, and the world's smallest black net bikini. Led from there and un-robed I was attacked - splashed - soaked - in warm water, the first of ten steps to a most wonderful feeling of privileged pampering.

As an avid spa goer, she could compare on the environment as well the quality of treatments and she was also impressed. We chose a hammam with hair treatment and a relaxing massage. Expert hands and friendly staff. We might have appreciated a slightly longer relaxation time between hammam and massage and maybe a couple of those lovely oriental sweets with the tea, but still it was close to perfection. Will return again, even though it is a bit a pricier hammam. To be recommended"

Initially we were taken to seperate changing rooms where a robe, paper undies, and slippers were provided. After a brief waiting period we were taken into a sauna where we were bathed in water and left to relax. We were then covered in black soap from the Atlas mountains and scrubbed from head to toe using exfoliating gloves, they applied a different soap and we went back to the sauna for more relaxation. After this we showered and were taken to another waiting room where we had tea and petit fours.We were then taken into another room where we had a massage from head to toe, it was the most relaxing experience I had ever had! We left absolutely floating and completely de-stressed, only wishing we could stay for longer and kicking ourselves that we didn't get more of these done!

The sauna and scrub were very westerner friendly and the girls kept checking we were ok with the products, water temperature and the level of scrubbing.We did the hammam as a couple, which was probably a bit nicer than doing it alone because there were less awkward moments. Make sure you don't do this with work colleagues or immediate family because it involves essentially complete nudity. We were escorted to a chill-out room after and served mint tea and water, which was lovely. Overall a very nice experience, and you get to take your scrubbing glove home as a nice gesture."

From the moment we walked in we were treated to a wonderful experience. Most Hammams in Marrakech won't even let men and women into the same areas, but we were able to share the whole experience together, from the full Hammam through to the lengthy deep massage to finish.Highly recommended, though don't try to book online - they don't seem to receive the bookings. Not a problem though as they fitted us in when we walked in off the street."

She does not speak much english but did a good job of communicating anyway. Khadija was an amazing masseuse. Only thing I would change is if the front door staff were more warm, and explained ahead of time what to expect for a newcomer - for example I was washed but then told that staff would be back. About 20 minutes later I was still sitting in the hot room wondering what was next. Had I known it would be such a long wait I could have relaxed into it more.Also they say it is 90 minutes but we were there for 2.5. Not that I am complaining - I loved the extra time!"

'You must do a Hammam and I know just the place' was the simple instruction given to my wife and I when we borrowed a friends apartment in Marrakech.The location took a bit of finding, but once inside we were welcomed and invited to the changing rooms. As a very large gentleman, I had never tried such an experience and was apprehensive to say the least. My anxieties were not assisted when asked to change and provided with a paper thong and a bath robe that I would have struggled to get on one arm. A larger one was found and a towel to cover the gaping robe. I decided that keeping my boxer shorts on was the best option! We were then invited upstairs to the treatment room where we were greeted by our host. Robes removed and my wife and I were invited to sit in the steam room. After a short while, anxiety rising, the female host entered and instructed me to stand, where she then poured water from a central basin all over me. I was then asked to sit where she started to lather the black soap all over my body - anxiety overload! I then watched as the same was done to my wife, who also was out of her comfort zone.In for a penny; in for the pound! I'm here now and took the view that I might as well enjoy it and found as the next treatment started I relaxed. My body was scrubbed (exfoliated) washed and oiled so many times I could not now remember the exact sequence of events. I was so relaxed that at one point I almost fell asleep! Treatment complete and I was escorted upstairs in my robe to a calming waiting room with big sofas where mint tea and water was served whilst I relaxed and waited for my wife to join. I felt amazing! Relaxed, de-stressed and carefree! All anxiety washed away!!For those who have never done this before, take a spare pair of underwear if you don't want to wear the paper alternative, or go commando on the way home! This is a must do experience in a beautiful location with respectful staff. I will return on my next visit to the town. I would have given it full marks if they had the oversized robe for us big chaps!"

Ladies - don't be shy; you will be expected to undress and they provide you with a robe, slippers and paper knickers but I wore my bikini bottoms and that was fine - but really do not worry it does not feel awkward at all and the staff are very respectful and considerate. It definitely is a lovely and reasonably priced experience that is a relaxing break from the madness of Marrakech!

I booked online before my holiday and had some email contact (in poor french) before I arrived, but I popped in on the day to check if I needed a swim suit (You don't. Paper thong provided). The lady on the desk seemed to have no idea about my booking until I showed her my phone. But to her credit she obviously moved a couple of bits around and booked me in again straight away. I think I was lucky it was low season. Don't rely on this. I would imagine this place is VERY popular at peak times.The spa is every bit what you would expect by English standards and has a very lovely feel to it. Although I made a botch job of trying to communicate in basic French, the ladies spoke more English than I was expecting from past reviews but I could tell they appreciated me trying! Despite what I had read, they WILL look after you at each stage and you won't be left wondering what is going on.I went for the Hammam de la Rose treatment which is 90 mins and includes hammam then massage (you will select which scented oil you'd like). A lady will take you to change and give you a locker key and robe, slippers, and thong. Once you're ready she will collect you and take you up to the hammam area (dimly lit which is nice, although I was the only one there), swap your slippers for plastic sandals and you will be washed and left to steam for probably 10 minutes. You'll then be washed again and taken to the adjoining room where you have your scrub down on the concrete bench. Even if you have no French they'll lead/turn you around etc in a kind and gentle way, so you feel looked after and know what is going on. You steam again I think and have various washes (hair) and are moisturised etc before eventually being taken in your robe to an area where they'll bring you tea and water. At this point you really will never have felt as clean or soft in your life. As a nice touch you are given the exfoliating mitten to keep. Also, the lady did check that the pressure was OK with me. Then you are collected for your massage (including the most amazing scalp massage) and oh my goodness I came away from that place floating on a wafty cloud of heavenliness that I can't imagine could ever be replicated. I was glad my riad was close by, so I could flop (and then have a thorough wash off of all the oils in my hair before bed. You will def want to do this). My boyfriend laughed when I sent home a selfie of my woozy self as he said I looked \"stoned\". I almost wish I had gone for a 4 handed massage as Marrakech is so cheap I probably could have afforded to do that, but honestly, I have had a number of spa treatments over the years and for me, this stands out as the most heavenly. Most needed after foot-pounding and sightseeing for a couple of days. The hammam is easy to spot in Rue Dar el Bacha so no worries there.Now I just wish someone would set up the real hammam experience here in England. I'd pay good money for that over and over and over again...mmmmm :)"

I have been to Turkish Baths in Istanbul, but I must say that I enjoyed the experience of the Hammam better. The greeting at reception could have been friendlier, as could the girls who bathed us. I think the language barrier doesn't help as I speak limited French. The overall experience was good, and the interior of the Hammam itself is very relaxing. It was nice to be left for half an hour or so in between the bathing and massage on a huge comfy sofa drinking tea and water. The full body massage was certainly relaxing and unhurried. The girls that did the massage seemed friendlier than the ones that did the bathing. I'm not sure I'd necessarily return to this one as there are so many other Hammams in Marrakech to experience."

Each of the treatments was similar, sit, lie front, turn, followed by a shove. The scrub was rough and too hard, despite me saying \"doucement'. Each of the treatments was done with the same amount of care, or lack thereof...Then after my treatment, they sit you in a room full of pillows with tea and water to relax, they forgot about me here and I had to get myself back to the change room...I realize there are cultural differences, these are to be expected, but when I am paying european prices for a spa session, it is not really acceptable to be made to feel like I am not welcome there.

We got to do treatment together, which was a big plus. We went to another Hammam earlier that week, where we booked two back massages, but we couldn't do those massages in the same room. The staff escorted us from the Hammam room to the relaxing room (where we got a cup of mint tea) and later to the massage room. We didn't see any other people, so it really made us feel like all the attention was focussed on us. The only point of improvement that we saw, was that the staff (except for the hostess) was a bit blunt. They did not smile or talk very often, for instance explain the steps of the hammam process. Overall it was a lovely first hammam experience, and we would definetly recommend la Rose to our friend who are going to Marrakech."

Jamila, the lady who scrubbed was excellent & made me very comfortable straight away. The massage was also lovely - if you prefer firmer pressure then ask up front. This hammam is small, has a personalised service & is very relaxing - I wasn't rushed at all."

I do believe that mobile phones should not be allowed to be used by therapists in a massage room, it is very unprofessional, I am a massage therapist myself and would never entertain taking my phone in the room while I was doing a massage.

A little rest at a lounge area followed with Moroccan mint tea and cold bottled water. Then came a most unforgettable massage. We felt so clean, light and happy after the entire experience.

The only thing to note is that our taxi driver took a while to find the Hammam and had to ask the locals and even took us to Riad de la Rose before finding the right place. We had planned to walk back into the square for a wander after our hammam experience, but we both felt so chilled and relaxed that we took a taxi back to our riad and continued to chill out and embrace the relaxation.

I requested a treatment, full Hammam and Massage expecting to be told they were full and they fit me in within the hour. It was delightful. The staff were warm and friendly and the prices were more than reasonable given what some places will try to charge you. My hair has never felt so soft and shone so bright. Neither has my skin. I have enjoyed a number of Hammams on my travels to Morocco, but in all honesty this was by far the best.We purchased some treatment oil on our way out and were shocked at how reasonable that was also.

After a good 10 minutes of this, the girl finally came in and performed a satisfactory massage. This was certainly pleasant enough, but she didn't seem to have any special expertise. She just massaged my feet as any layperson might. I guess I was expecting a more muted and relaxing atmosphere. It was adequate and a reasonably good value for money, but I wouldn't go back again."

As we had booked in for a hamman elsewhere (and you're not supposed to have more than one a week) we just booked this one for an hours full body massage. The spa itself was very clean, with a sparkly, modern look to it. We were given clean robes and clean slippers to wear and taken to a nice comfy seated waiting area upstairs. At this point it would have been nice to have been offered a drink (even water as we'd walked for a good 45mins to get there) but we were just left to wait, albeit in very nice surroundings.The massage itself was very good, unfortunately next door they were having building work and were constantly hammering! Credit to my massage lady, at some points I didn't notice it!Overall, although the treatment itself (500dh for an hour) was very good, we didn't receive the same level of customer service as we did at other places and spas we visited in Marrakech."

The location is amazing and the treatment was great but the only thing I disliked is whilst having a massage (with my friend) the two girls were whispering to each other and giggling the entire way through which I found off putting and didn't relaz as much as I should have. I would rather they just talked normally then whisper and do hand signals (which I could feel as one hand suddenly left my back whilst talking and the other one just do something repretitive) this happened numerous times and I felt like we weren't the priority...we did have a great time and it was relazing but that did spoil it slightly."

While waiting for your service you are seated in a nice lounge and ofered tea and water. The treatment rooms are spotless, have very pleasant music and are nicely lit. The massage I had was very good, I was offered 4 different scented oils. Prices are standard for Morocco. Would highly recommend. One small thing, when the massage was over, the therapist just left the room quitely...wasn't sure it was all over."

I am so glad that the Hammam de la Rose is in the top 10 place to see in Marrakech I remember writing about it when it was only open for a week and my review was never published as it was so new . Being a regular visitor to marrakech this place is more than welcome. People indulge on a hammam while visiting . One option is to have a hammam in your hotel/riad , but it is not the most practical solution when you are not staying in that hotel or riad. Lots of other option are out of town and require a lot of time to go there. , and some other places are simply tourist trap . This place is wonderfully located, in the northern part of the medina in the dar el bacha area north of the mouassine shopping quarter . The decor is fanstastic , in the turquoise blue and lime green , so you just already feel energised when you entered. The traetment rooms are well done, the staff is very friendly . The reason I don not give it top marls is for the fact that I only , so far , had the time to do quick visit ; waxing , or head massage, but haven't yet experience the hamman , but I have no doubt that it would be living to my expectation. The other thing is I find the staff extremely friendly , but not the one at the reception , and the prices are a bit too high . But it is the ideal place to book while in Marrakech , and so practical as it is in the medina so you can relax after ( or before ) your shopping."

The whole experience was calm, relaxing and elegant. The place is well setup for couples, 2 men in our case, but the hammams are big enough for a family or group. The experience wasn't cheap but well worth it - think how much you've saved by bargaining in the souks! Although our first hammam experience we are keen to try it again - though I doubt that many places will be as good De La Rose."

After 10 minutes relaxing there you are led into the next room and soaped all over with eucalyptus soap before being thoroghly exfoliated - this part can be a liittle daunting as the mitts are quite rough but if you can stand it your skin feels like a new-born baby's afterwards. If you wish for gentler treatment just ask. Then a warm shower before being rubbed with rose scented oil. Robes back on and you are led into a large room full of white sofas to enjoy a cool drink. Throughout soft and relaxing music is playing. It's hard to get up and get dressed to leave - you feel like staying there all day.

This is of a better standard than most exclusive versions of spa/beauty treatment centres in London uk. The rooms are so tranquil and well designed! The staff are very professional and speak good English. Other hammams throughout Marrakech are dingy, dirty and feel like your being rushed through on a conveyor belt their staff can be staff and some are a bit too inappropriate.

Despite arriving early as asked in their email, we were not provided with the pre-spa experience as promised, but offered robes and asked to change. Now, we've had hammams before in Turkey, and this was a sort of hammam but a very weak one, not a real one. Two ladies went through the process of throwing water on us and very feebly soaping up our skin before being left in the sweat room for way beyond the promised ten minutes with no water. Carelessly the tap was annoyingly left dripping making a loud noise that completely ruined any chance of relaxing. Needless to say we got concerned we'd been forgotten about after the ten minutes had lapsed and had to start taking water from the washing tap to ward off dehydration.Finally the therapists arrived back and we got to ask for some bottled water. They then directed us to another room where a severe exfoliation took place as well as shampooing of the body and hair. The consultants then left the room again for 5 mins but as neither of us had been rinsed off properly we had to quickly re rinse ourselves as we both got bad soap stinging in our eyes. This was not going well, and again no chance to relax and enjoy this not inexpensive experience.As per other Hammans, after 5 minutes we were then rinsed again and left to cool and try to relax in bathrobes, but that was impossiblein a very noisey spa area. Another guest felt the noise of staff chattering at reception and the banging of doors so bad she shut the spa doors, as they should have been, to get some peace and quiet. But the staff opened them again - again no chance to relax! We then progressed to our massage treatment.Luckily for me I had a massage therapist who was experienced and knew what she was doing. Unfortunately my partner had the opposite experience and wanted to stop the treatment as it was a waste of time despite the massage therapist being asked three times to increase the pressure. This experience left them frustrated and really annoyed a lot of money had been wasted.We shared our experiences with the shift manager at the time of our departure and as some compensation, besides an apology and promise of a complimentary treatment next time if we are ever back in Marrakech, we were given two free beers at the rooftop bar.I don't think we'll be taking up the free service offer. Nice rooftop bar though."

Despite it being tucked away in streets we didn't know, it was actually quite easy to find the hotel. The welcome was excellent and we were shown to the spa, where the welcome was again, friendly and efficient. We had a couples spa experience with a traditional steam room (by god that was warm and humid) followed by a scrubbing and a wash from the friendly staff. We then had a 4 hands massage, which was a new experience. We both found that we each had one masseuse that was slightly firmer than the other, which was about the only criticism. And that's so minor it's hardly worth mentioning as the massage itself was firm but relaxing. Neither of us had any muscle pain the following day. We did both fall asleep at the end as well. Definitely one of the best spa experiences I've had."

We now have La Sultana Spa in our top 5 must-do things in Marrakesh! Unlike a couple of other spas we used, here we found no old/stained towels, moldy smells, disappointing massages or gaps of information by the staff. I very much appreciated that the sponges and other tools they use on you are new out of the package, which they open in front of you, and they even give it to you at the end. The facilities are beautiful (the jacuzzi in particular may be the most beautiful we've seen), the staff very courteous and attentive, and the treatments well executed. I got \"French\" nails, which I only later learned had an extra cost, but they took it off the bill without me even raising the issue. We also appreciated that there was no rush to get us through, which we noticed in a couple of other places, so we were able to really enjoy the experience.We wrapped up the session with lunch by the pool and highly recommend doing this. You should definitely save some room for dessert, as their desserts are not only good but also little pieces of art. The gentleman from the front desk offered us cold water bottles on our way out... this was very welcome before heading back to Marrakesh crazy streets and high August temperatures.Overall, the experience was worth every penny and we can't wait to do it again whenever we are back."

The staff were friendly, attentive, thorough and respectful, in particular taking time to discuss the most appropriate oils (I have a nut allergy) and being physically delicate after a recent illness.

Located in a fairy-tale style hotel, this spa enchants you. You always wish to return.Sultana spa manager, charming Rashida, runs a team of massage, facial and hammam therapists, each best in her own field. A combination of bubbly jacuzzi, hot mint tea, thorough hammam treatment, gentle facial and deep tissue massage is an amazing value for money. You will be treated with fig oils, mud wraps, grapefruit creams and rose water. Sultana makes you forget about life outside the walls of this fort, unfinished to-do lists or anything else. Instead, you will focus on yourself, reconnect with your body and get a much deserved break. Time to feel pampered and spoilt! Great thanks to Rashida and her dedicated team, and I cannot wait to be back next year."

There are many levels and styles of \"hamams\" as we learned during our 3 different visits over two weeks in Morocco, and though \"rustic and traditional\" is a certain kind of experience you might want to have, if you really want to be pampered, indulged in, experience something different than you can find at home, be in a place of total beauty and serenity, feel like a new person after you leave this sanctuary, you must go to Sultana Spa.

The hammam treatment started with roughly 15 minutes in the steam room, followed by a scrub/ wash session in the hammam. As a bonus my mother in law was offered a free massage which she really enjoyed, as she suffered from severe pain in her neck. The massage offered by Rachidad made her pain disappear almost completely. I have not visited any other spas in Marrakech, so I cannot compare this place with any other similar spa.

My mani / pedi was carried out by 2 beauticians working in parallel and was excellent too.

Rosa Bonheur were able to fit us in at short notice and we opted for the Ritual signing Rosa Bonheur package. This was our first hammam and we weren't too sure what to expect. The team at Rosa Bonheur were fantastic, they were professional from the minute we walked in. At each step of the package we were told what would happen so we knew what was coming. The hammam was an amazing experience, the two women who treated us were obviously experienced and made sure we were always happy and comfortable. We then both had a medium massage which were the best massages we have ever had. We have had quite a few massages while travelling and Saida and Leila are easily on another skill level. We can't recommend this place enough! Please please please go - you won't be disappointed! We will definitely be returning on our next visit to Marrakech. Thank you so much to everyone involved in our experience there :)"

After doing a desert excursion for a few nights I came back to Marrakesh feeling like I had sand in all the wrong places. I visited the Hammam after reading the sterling reviews here on TripAdvisor and it was so refreshing to see how accurate they were. From the moment I walked in and until the moment I walked out I was treated excellently. I had the pleasure of being greeted and served tea by the charming Jawad, had a splendid time meeting the Hamaam owner Mariam, was scrubbed clean from head to toe by the ever so detailed Hesna and Fatima, and all before I received a rejuvenating massage by Layla. There's so much more raving that I can do but I'll leave it at this. Hammam Rosa Bonheur is the best way to take a break from the Hustle and bustle of the red city, if just for a moment. PS. To the guys, you're in for a treat when you see what you have to wear into the Hammam"

Its purpose fitted perfectly before the massage which was to clean us, scrub the skin and then sweat out all the bad stuff. It was very professionally done and started off the relaxation process.After we had the massage which was incredible. They do it however you want and you can change mid session. My Wife had medium and changed to hard during the session. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the women mount her putting all her energy into what my wife describes as 'the best massage she has ever had'. Mine was perfect, I opted for Medium and it was the most relaxed I have been for a long time.They gave us a free foot massage in addition to the facial, and after the process we had a meal on the roof which was the best Tagine we tasted since arriving a week ago.After the whole thing, they gave us two bottles of complimentary Argon oil which we had previously bought from a Argan Plantation place for 30 euros a bottle, so incredibly generous. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting an unforgettable evening and a true taste of Marrakech."

He then sat with us, treated us some tea, and made sure that we understood what hammam entailed and the price that we would have to pay for the treatment.The hammam sauna was wonderful, and my wife really enjoyed her massage, which went above and beyond what was expected, both in time and in quality. I ordered a traditional Moroccan meal and ate on the terrace waiting for my wife to finish her treatment.At the end of our session we sat together again, had some more tea and chatted about our experience.

The Hammam scrub, an amazing never ending massage followed by a great dinner on the rooftop. You will get picked up at a central meeting place (very convenient) and at the Hammam all questions are answered in perfect English. Go there and indulge!"

We were constantly lost in the medina so after alot of circling finally one kind soul showed us the way! They almost couldnt fit us in but luckily as we were walking out they had a cancellation! Phew! We thoroughlu enjoyed the whole thing. The friendliness the feeling of being looked after and the laugh.Being our first hammam we didnt know what to expect so after changing into our lil disposable gstrings they gave us (my partner and i had great giggles at this) the sauna scrubs and rinses were soooo relaxing and the massages to die for. We were like pure jelly leaving and id give anything yo be back in morocco to get it done again. The staff are soo incredibly nice and we were welcomed back yo just come in and sit to drink tea any other time we felt like having a break from the medina being told this is our other home. It really felt that way \u263a the only bad thing was not having card facilities. I personally dont like using atm machines in busy touristy areas so widh i had of had enough cash on me or that they had card facilities. This place id great tho. Well worth walking in circles trying to find it! P.s it really is down these quiet lil laneways that can feel a little intimidating but its worth it for this lil gem \u263a"

Few things to know:1) It is in a very remote place so a bit difficult to find, we had to ask a few locals for directions2) Don't be put off by the outside of the building, its much much nicer inside!3) If you are in a large group call and book the treatments in advance. I spoke to a guy called Joel at the spa and as we were a group of 12 he gave us a good discount4) If opting for the argan oil massage, they will get this all over you including your face and hair so tell them in advance if you don't want that or if you do then be prepared5) they have showers on site which are cleanWe had a large group so some people got individual rooms and others were sharing. I shared with a friend and the two masseuses were great however from time to time they would speak to each other in French which was quite unprofessional. All in all I would definitely go back as its great value for money and the staff are friendly. There are no extras or hidden fees. You pay downstairs for your treatment after its over and we also got a free gift (Argan oil for each person). You can also tip the person who did your treatment if you feel you want to."

We were told that we would be met in the square by members of staff who would guide us to the Hammam. I was pleasantly pleased with this, however we were running late and it so happens the owner of the Riad I was staying at knew Samira and Abdul and called for them to arrange a pickup from the Riad for me. They kindly sent Rachid to pick us up and he was extremely friendly and great. We were then taken to the hammam and greeted by a beautiful lady (I forgot her name :-( ) who was great in explaining the services and gave us mint tea and biscuits on arrival. I got the Oriental Ritual package which included the hammam which was done by Leilo who was great. The hammam consisted of me going into a steam room type set up and received a full body treatment which included a black soap scrub , ghassoul and henna. The scrub down of my skin was shocking, as I saw the amount of dead skin being removed(considering I had a body scrub done 2 days before!). It was all in all a great treat!The highlight HAD to be my massage however! I have had massages done in many major cities and this one was TOP NOTCH! I cannot recommend Noima enough! I wanted to take her in my suitcase back home! She was EXCELLENT in her technique and believe me when I tell you I felt so refreshed it was unbelievable. I also had my facial done by her which was simple yet effective and had my skin glowing for days. We also had the meal which was ok, something we could have lived without. We had the lemon chicken meal, which was served with soup, olives,bread and steamed vegetables as a starter. The dessert was then pieces of orange with flaked almonds.We had henna designs done seperately by a lady which they call in-which cost 10euros each (which was NOT the price quoted by Jomod[the manager]) but nonethless we had the henna done. It was burning throughout and we were told this was normal. The henna did not last even a day before it started fading and it was when I got back to London I was told it was loaded with chemicals which is why it was burning and did not last. My friend had a pedicure done by Loufna and she said it was great-didn't get too much details there.All in all a great experience and definetely get the hammam and massage by Noima! The meal and henna designs can be skipped."

We didnt have any booking done, we just turned up and ask whether there are any availabilities and luckily they can accommodate both of us later on the same day. The location is a bit hidden, its a bit tricky to find it first time to the point we have to ask a local man to guide us there but when you know the location is easy to get back to. The service is amazing. Very polite, very helpful. We are served mint tea and cookies when we arrive. The hammam is very clean and smells amazing. There is a locker to store your clothes and valuables when you are in the Hammam.The ladies that do the hammam are excellent especially one lady called Nesreen. She scrubbed and scrubbed you until you can feel there is not a single dirt / dry skin left in your body and it does not hurt at all. Unfortunately they didn't speak much english and we did not speak French or arabic so most conversation is sign language and a smile. Chilled water is provided plenty during the hammam which is important for hydration. The message is lovely. Good pressure. Again the rooms are very clean, tidy and smells nice and relaxing. When we are about to leave they send us off with a bottle of argan oil each which is gratefully accepted. Not the cheapest hammam but for me is one of the most worthwhile spa / treatment ever. Definitely worth a visit."

My wife, daughter and I visited the Hammam in March 2016 and I signed up for the 2h15min Hammam and massage package.The hammam was not quite what I was expecting as I was anticipating that the 'argile' (clay) that they put on you was almost layerered on with a thick coat but in fact it is much more of an exfoliating type of soap that is rather briskly applied all over the body and then left on for a few minutes. In any event the very loud / raucous shouts, laughter and babble from a group of 4/5 young frenchman in the next door hammam ensured this was anything but a peaceful experience!Having been scrubbed and washed down by a friendly lady who spoke neither french or english I was then led to my massage room and given a full body massage by a super friendly lady.Whilst the whole experience was not as peaceful as it should have been; I left the place more than satisfied - my skin feeling soft and re-awakened!The manager and his super friendly wife/business partner had the grace to apologise for the noise and gave me a little gift of massage oil for which many thanks!"

We went to have a look and decide for ourselves what we wanted. We were received at the entrance by Samir who offered the classic mint tea and marrocain patisserie....it was a very nice and quiet place...low light and soft talk. We talked a bit with him about the city before he got into the Hammam offers and suggestions. Then he took the time to explain each one in details. We already had an idea of what we wanted and had done a bit of research before..this seemed like the best option, even though it is not especially cheap is GREAT value for money. We went for a Hammam with the black soap and scrub, a relaxing and long massage, a facial (scrub, massage), and the dinner. We decided to have it around 4:30pm to have dinner there and not be wondering around finding a place to eat!!! It was a great idea 100% recommended. The food was very nice and we enjoyed it but if you are looking for more options and a gastronomic feast you might prefer to look for a restaurant after the treatment. Everything was great! The Hammam is a great experiences...completely different at what we were used to but very nice in holidays! Nice relaxing massage and facial! The staff were great too!!! all perfect!! "

The argan oil massage was extremely nice. I have back problems and after an hour massage it didn't hurt me for four or five weeks! Amazing!!When I arrived Samira was very attentive and offered me some watermelon and tea on the house. She even gave me a little present: a small bottle of argan oil.Such a pity I discovered this place just the day before going back to London, but I do highly recommend the experience to anyone, either for healthy reasons or just for having a relaxing moment. The hammam is small and although very close to Jemaa el Fna, not easy to find for the first time, but Samira will send someone to pick you up if needed."

He is simply incredible with ideas, with innovative ways to make sure that you get the full experience of the land. He is Ultra Polite, professional, quite charming, and willing to go the extra mile to accommodate everyone. His english speaking skills are excellent, and he adapts to his clients as needed.

The girls used techniques i've never seen before. The argan oil makes it all the better for your skin. We also did the hammam and facials, which I would recommend. especially the hammam, as this loosens you up before the massage. It was amazing to see how much dead skin comes off. Your skin feels new and refreshed like never before after the hammam. I wish we had something like this tradition of hammam in the west, as it's so therapeutic. they were very generous with their time for us too."

Booked a hammam and massage for me and my friend (both guys).A rep from the spa was kind enough to meet us in the square, as the spa was hidden away. We were led to the spa and we took a seat in front of a log fire. We were offered mint tea, other beverages and some biscuits. After relaxing for a little we were led down to the hammam. We changed into robes (lockers provided for our clothes) and entered. Temperature was just right and smelt of eucalyptus everywhere. We were shampooed, rubbed and scrubbed thoroughly by two moroccan girls. Feeling thoroughly clean we were led back upstairs for some more mint tea! After a little we went upstairs for our massage (choice of either same room or different rooms). We chose whether we wanted a light, medium or hard massage. I chose hard and my friend chose light. 1 and a half hours later I felt like every knot had been taken out of my back and there hadn't been a single muscle untouched. My friend was asleep, apparently it was that relaxing. After that we had yet more mint tea, and the rep led us back out and even hailed a cab for us. Every single staff member was kind, accommodating and paid attention to detail. We didn't feel rushed whatsoever (spent a good 4 hours there in total). The prices were very reasonable and was even given some argan oil as a keepsake. I have been to a few spas and I cannot recommend this one enough. 10/10"

While drinking our welcome tea, we chose the body scrub / hammam and one-hour massage. I felt a little nervous not knowing what to expect, but everyone made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable. One thing to note is that the small package they give with the robes is disposable underwear that you are meant to put on before the hammam - we thought it was a hair net! So we certainly surprised the staff when we showed up to the bath without the underwear! They had a great sense of humor about it and quickly brought us a pair to wear. The bath and scrub were amazing - I couldn't believe how much dirt it cleaned off! The scrub might be too hard for some, but it was the perfect strength for me. I'm sure the wonderful ladies would accommodate if you wanted a lighter scrub. The massage was heavenly. My usual complaint with massages is that they are too light - but my Rosa Bonheur massage was the perfect pressure! And the masseuse had some really lovely techniques that I'd never experienced before. Afterwards, I felt so wonderful and really appreciated the impeccable service of all of the staff. We will definitely visit again when we return to Marrakech!"

For others who are reluctant I'll describe the process! We called in in the afternoon and were given an appointment a couple of hours later. On arrival you are given tea and then taken upstairs where you change into the paper pants and a bathrobe. Your clothes get put in a basket and locked, you have the key.We went into the hammam room together and were given the black soap scrub. The ladies who did it just get on with it, so you don't feel too self conscious. They leave you covered in soap for a bit and then scrub you. After they had rinsed us, we were dressed in the bathrobes again and taken for our treatments. My partner had his massage and I opted for the less personal manicure. I was sat in the lounge area while the girl did it in my bathrobe, but everyone is in the state at some point or another!The girl who did my manicure was very sweet and did an excellent job. I said I was a little reluctant but she totally put me at my ease. She is a credit to that hammam!My partner joined me downstairs and then I got changed again. I had lots of tea throughout, sat next to a lovely fire which was very welcome for December. A nice chat with the owner on the way out and we were back into the hubbub of the medina."

Like many places in the medina, it has an unassuming front door (and the Google maps location isn't quite right, so we had to ask around to find it the first time; the second time, they sent someone to pick us up from our riad). But it's quite lovely inside! And they are good with amenities: biscuits and mint tea to welcome you, a robe and disposable bikini for the bath, shower facilities afterwards. We did the bath and mud mask + massage + foot massage package. The bath takes places downstairs in a room that feels like a mix between a sauna and a steam room. Someone pours water on you, soaps you up, scrubs you down with a black glove -- you'll be impressed at how much dead skin comes off -- then you get the all-body mud mask, and another rinse off. Then it's upstairs for the massage. Fairly standard massage as they go, with plenty of Moroccan oils to go around. Depending on how you like the pressure of your massages, make sure to let your masseuse know to adjust. My friend and I both asked for hard pressure but felt it a bit soft to the touch."

The package we got, that I suggest, includes a Hammam scrubbing, body mask/ sauna, hour massage, facial, and nice rooftop dinner for 95\u20ac. They also gave us free Argan oil afterwards.

Arrived at the spa premises, warm welcome greet and friendly staff - But about the place, to be honest nothing luxury about it, just average room, and yes at arrival they served you tea and biscuit...but again nothing special about it. Then not long after waiting in the reception room we are ready for Hammam & massage time. The Hammam was kind of fun, we have plenty laugh and the lady staff who did our Hammam very much keen doing the scrubbing. We enjoying this part. Please note: you can ask for separate room if you prefer mum+daughter and father+son. And after that, we have 1 hour and 15 mins massage, it feels so long laying down in the dark room and almost forget we've been at this spa place for nearly 3 hours. Next, is the second best part: our evening meals at the top terrace. The traditional food that we had is very tasty : chicken tajin, lentil soup, local bread, couscous, mini pastry roll, aubergine stew/tajin and traditional fruit dessert. We are very full as it is big portion of dishes. After finish our meal, we spent the rest of the evening enjoying the sunset at the very terrace top. with aromatic minty tea.

I decided to get a hammam and then full body massage, which were great choices. I am someone who likes a hard massage -- it can really never be too hard for me.

The woman that helped me even washed my hair and braided it back. I felt wonderful. After the Hammam, my partner and I padded downstairs in our fluffy robes that we had been given. We then had wonderful massages. I highly suggest the argan oil massage! After they finished our massages we were left in a private room with an adjacent bathroom to change and shower. Once we had cleaned up, we exited the room and were offered mint tea again. It was a truly lovely experience and we felt most welcomed. I highly recommend this spa."

Booking was easy, just drop them an email from their web page and they will reply almost immediately.Samira collected us from the main square, as the Riad where the Hammam is located is hard to find (via the souk, don't try it alone!). We were welcomed in the traditional way with a serving of green mint tea (wish we could get that over here as it was delicious).The hammam part of the treatment was a bit awkward at first, mainly due to English bashfulness in being naked and washed by strangers (both female), but once you get over that fact it is a lovely experience. The amount of dead skin removed is incredible!! Be aware if you have sunburn, but letting Samira know this will be translated to the ladies.The massage was the best I have ever had. Slightly too rough, but afterwards you feel amazing. Very talented.My fiance doesn't like people touching his face, so instead of the facial he was given a foot treatment. I really enjoyed the facial, pretty much the same as those offered over here in English spas.The meal afterwards on the roof terrace/retreat was lovely and very filling. The service was the main thing here, felt completely welcome from the moment we arrived. Didn't see any other guests at the same time, so felt like VIP's. Samira even assisted in suggesting some bars to visit in Marrakech, going as far as to Whatsapp me the information the next evening.We will be back if ever we visit Marrkech again!Thanks to the whole team :) x"

Given tea and biscuits on arrival, with a wonderful host who chatted to us. The hammam was amazing - who knew you could rub that much skin off! I felt brand new. The massage was really lovely and relaxing. The experience was really long, you really got your moneys worth. We then had lunch on the terrace which was lovely. They gave us far too much food but the pastrys that were served as a starter were wonderful, I would go back again just for those! Will definitely return when I go back to Marrakech"

We booked this purely based on the reviews on here, I don't know if most people who have reviewed it just had a hamman bath or if the reviews are wrong because it was quite awful.We booked a 2.5 hour package for \u20ac90 - hamman, massage, facial and lunch. Plus we added extra a manicure and pedicure. This was done via email in the UK.The person met us as planned and took us there.First impressions were a little tatty but we were reassured by the good reviews on here.The hamman bath part was ok, in fact quite good, then it went down hill!The massage was dreadful - not really a massage more of a rubbing in of oil! I am a trained sports massage therapist and I would say the lady who massaged me had no training at all - which is quite dangerous. I had to stop her doing very incorrect moves from time to time.The facial was a quick application of a scrub (no cleanse first) then an application of oil - no mask or eye cream etc.The worst part was the manicure and pedicure - these girls obviously have no training at all. The hygiene factor was zero and the choice of colours - 2 shades of red! They massacred the cuticles and did the worst paint job. Since returning my friend has contracted a nail fungus on her toes - which doesn't surprise me at all.We finally got lunch at 3.45 having arrived at 11. We were starving. Starters were bland and tasteless, the tagine was good.The whole experience was ruined as was our trip when after we paid one of the staff (a man) chased us into the souk saying he had undercharged us and wanted an extra \u20ac40 each! He was quite rude. Thank god I had printed off the email with the agreed price. He then tried to say thy had misunderstood and quoted the wrong price, he then said the prices on the website were wrong etc. He was quite pushy, only for the fact I am more pushy and told him to get lost, they would have fleeced us for an extra \u20ac80!The whole day was unprofessional and we were left feeling quite shaken by the altercation in the souk.I would URGE you avoid this place, they don't deserve the high rating at all - there are better and much cheaper places.I always write fair reviews and would have given this no \"dots\" if I could have I feel that strongly as to how bad it was...."

After a full day of walking in the heat and traffic of Marrakech we really needed some relaxation and spontaneously gave this number one hammam on Tripadvisor a call. They instantly picked us up at the main square (Jamma El Fna) and led us to their riad, a few windy alleys off the square. It was no problem to get a 2h SPA treatment (hammam and massages) for both of us at once, without any reservation. We have both had many massage treatments around the world and can assure that the quality certainly matches if not exceeds significantly higher priced options elsewhere. Moreover, the young team was exceptionally motivated and charming, we laughed a lot with the girls in the hammam and later had endless cups of tea with one of the organizing guys. We wandered home very happy and relaxed. Thank you, Samira and team!P.S. If you want to find the place, better give them a call! They are moving around due to renovation, so the adress we found here on Tripadvisor was not correct and we would nearly have missed this great experience."

They met me in front of Cafe Arabe and I'm grateful because it might have been a bit difficult to find on my own. I was welcomed with tea and nice conversation at the riad. Though it's my third time to Morocco, it was my first hammam experience. I don't know what I was waiting for! I had the \"royal treatment\" package and it was well worth it. It included a sauna steam, total body skin treatment of black soap followed by \"terre\" or mud, massage, facial and dinner on the rooftop terrace. Everything was fantastic. If you have never had a hammam and hesitate because you might feel shy, just go for it! The young women at Hammam Rosa Bonheur who provided the treatments were extremely professional, sweet and very helpful in guiding me through the process. Not to mention that my skin feels amazing and it was incredibly relaxing.Dinner on the rooftop terrace was such a lovely bonus! Not only was it absolutely tasty and abundant, the proprietors offered such wonderful service. Once the meal was underway, they ended up joining me and the other dinner guests. They are so kind, generous, interesting, and easy going. I would have happily stayed and visited all evening if I hadn't been staying on the other side of the medina. My only regret is that I didn't stay in one of their riads! Really, they are a super hospitable, professional and friendly bunch. It was a wonderful and genuine expression of Moroccan hospitality. A big thanks to Samir and his lovely team! Merci et \u00e0 la prochaine!"

One cannot go to Morocco with experiencing a hammam and I saved this occasion for an extra special day during my trip in celebration of my 40th birthday. On the day of my appointment, Samira arranged for Saida to come and meet me at Jemaa El Fna so that I could find my way to the spa. I walked in to the immediately soothing smell of orange essence oils surrounding me...this sent me into an instant state of relaxation. I had never experienced a hammam and did not know what to expect...within a few minutes of the washing/steaming/scrubbing process, I felt like I was in another world and my entire being and skin were completely rejuvenated and like new. Following the traditional washing and scrubbing from the hammam, I went for my hour long massage, which after pretty intense traveling through Morocco via trains and non-stop walking, was desperately needed and surpassed my expectations. I truly did not want any of my treatments to end at the spa and could have happily spent several more hours there (perhaps even days)...the 3 1/2 hours there was pure bliss. But, it did not stop there...once I showered and got dressed at the end of my appointment, I went downstairs only to be absolutely stunned and speechless when Samira and her staff surprised me with a gorgeous birthday cake and sang \"happy birthday\" to me in Arabic...I was traveling alone in Morocco on my 40th birthday without any family, my kids or friends...I had no words except tears and gratitude for this gesture on their part and the joy in my heart in being able to celebrate this momentous event surrounded by new friends...."

The one star I have given the Bon Honeur is not given lightly (see my other TA reports) and is as a result of my discussing this with my daughters, to come up with a fair review of our (4 females - mum, two daughters and daughter in law) experience. We did not have a problem with the treatments per se we had but rather with the poor communication, overcharging and lying.Let me begin. After much research, I kept coming back to the Bon Honeur because of the fab reviews on trip advisor. I emailed them on the morning on our last day in Marrakesh to ask them for an appointment and detailed that we all wanted different treatments. They emailed back with lots of offers, asked us to confirm (which we did) and sent someone to meet us at the main square in the medina.On arrival, and because we wanted to use up the last of our dirhams, we were discussing how we would pay - the guide who had met us was presumably the manager and he said there wouldn't be a problem if we didn't have enough dirhams because they had a card machine. My eldest daughter specifically confirmed this with him. Then he told us to hurry up because they had other clients! (We had just been poured tea at this point). Not a good start and it set the tone for the rest of the experience. On perusing the 'menu' it was clear that there were not as many treatments available as on the website. The only facial available on the menu was 'anti ageing' (at 30\u20ac) not really suitable for my 26 year old daughter in law (she had picked out a 'facial with organic products' at 20\u20ac on the website (in the event the facial she was given cost 35\u20ac!). Secondly, we were told there was no one to do my daughter's pedicure as they said the person was off sick. When challenged as to why they didn't let us know this in the email, we were fobbed off with them pretending to not understand. My youngest daughter wanted a back massage but she to her surprise she had a whole body massage (which of course cost more money). I had a hamman and massage but there were different options on the website and at no time was I asked what sort of hamman or massage (relaxing or with oils etc) did I want (other than hard, medium or soft).The upshot of this was that we were short of 300 dhs. We were then told that we couldn't pay by machine so we were unceremoniously marched to the square where we had to draw money out on a bank card to pay for this. (I am guessing he wanted to avoid the charge).The whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths and what was to be a treat at the end of our break together was really stressful. We felt they pulled the 'don't understand' card out because we weren't going to spend lots of money. I don't give one star reviews lightly and I do understand how poor reviews affects businesses but I have tried to recount as honestly as I can, our experience at this spa. Service is very important and is rewarded if earned but the service (excluding treatments) from the Bon Honeur was shockingly bad. We all left hugely disappointed."

We met Samir at Caf\u00e9 de France in Rue des Banques and it was just a few minutes walk from their to the hammam. We had a delicious mint tea known as \"Moroccan Whiskey\" and then off up to get dressed in our paper knickers. I think the whole experience lasted four hours. There was scrubbing and washing and oiling and massaging and eating and drinking. I actually fell asleep during the massage I was so relaxed. Samir and his team are the nicest people you could ever want to meet and he helped us find some good bargains in the markets nearby. I wish I could travel to their hammam once a week to get recharged more often. Hope to see you soon Samir x"

The location of the place is difficult to find so I would recommend you pre-organise your massage and request the Manager to meet you at a specific location. When arriving at Hammam Rosa Bonheur, it was very clean and we were offered mint tea, biscuits and water which was nice! The Hammam scrub and massage was very relaxing and probably one if not the best massage I have had to date. It is great value for money compared to UK prices and you get much more time. We paid for 1 and half hours but we must have easily had 2 hours of treatment. The staff are all very friendly and make you feel comfortable. I definitely recommend this place! 5 STARS and nothing less!"

We went for the package of Hammam, massage, facial and 3 course dinner on roof terrace, for 95 euros each (expensive for Marrakech but such good value compared to prices at home).We were met outside Cafe de France in the main square and were led to the Riad (just as well as it is difficult to find). Excellent tea and biscuits to start, followed by the Hammam. We were asked to put on funny little paper pants but as we were a family group we chose to keep full swimming costumes on which was fine. 45 mins in the steam room - black soap, then scrub. It was vigorous but felt wonderful and my skin has been so smooth since. Full body massage was wonderful - we had medium pressure which was quite firm enough. Facial was nice but I felt we were left alone too long - I would have preferred a head massage whilst the face mask was setting. Having said that, the therapists had just given us a massage and it was Ramadan so they'd probably had enough by 7pm.Dinner on roof terrace was lovely. We were all so relaxed and in a trance by the end of the evening. Overall a lovely experience, much more suited to us than the traditional Hammams sound like!"

The Hammam in the basement was a hour long scrub from top to toe. The products used were lovely. The hour long massage to follow was on the top floor, in a lovely treatment room, my husband and I had the whole spa treatment together. We then had the facial 30 mins, and organised also for later on was the traditional dinner. During our treatment we were offered lovely mint and lemon tea, and the morrocan biscuits. This is a must do experience, and I would recommend this spa to everyone going to marrakech.

The Rosa Bonheur is a short 10 minute walk from the Riad Reves 'D Orient where we stayed. Inside is beautiful, the staff are friendly, helpful and from the outset made us feel at ease. We were offered mint tea (Berber Whiskey) and cookies and had the chance to relax and talk before being led away to get changed. The hammam included relaxing in the steam room, body scrub and being washed with warm water, it lasts for about 40 mins. We were left feeling really clean and invigorated and were even given a bottle of Argan oil to take home with us. This hammam was really reasonably priced and great way to relax after a day at the souks, I highly recommend it!!"

The riad was beautiful and traditionally decorated we were given mint tea to drink while we chose our treatment. My friend and I both had the massage and we were massaged at the same time in one room. The massage was really good one of the best full body massages I've had. However the ladies kept yawning and sighing... Not a major problem but don't usually experience that with a massage. I felt like maybe they put more effort in to people who spend a little more and have a Hammam as well. Despite this it was a good massage for a good price with friendly staff"

However, my first experience of this Hammam Spa was only about three months ago and I came back for more. That's how good this Spa is. It was booked for us by our lovely Tour Guide, Yassine, as part of a recent tour we did through 'Morocco-Traveldreams'.The Spa is located in quite a hard to find area, so you can arrange to be met at a suitable place by one of the staff. Myself and three friends chose the 'Special Offer Package' for \u20ac95, which consisted of a 'Traditional Hammam', black soap scrub for 45 minutes, followed by a very relaxing all over body massage for an hour and a half, then a thirty minute facial, followed by a traditional Moroccan meal......Total Bliss!! The staff are very welcoming and mint tea was awaiting us on our arrival. We were then ushered downstairs to the Hammam where we were given a robe, a pair of slippers and a teeny pair of paper knickers to change into. There's no need to bring anything with you, that's all you need. Just a word of warning though, this is not a spa for those who are shy. The four of us, all ladies, were treated to the black soap scrub, in the same room, with just the paper knickers on but hey, if you're all friends together, who cares. The ladies doing the scrub were professional and courteous at all times and made us feel relaxed. After the Hammam, we were taken upstairs for our massage in the same room and the ladies worked in sync with each other, making sure we all started and finished our treatments together. The massage was so relaxing, that I fell asleep. It was just wonderful. So much so that I did not want to get off the massage bed. I felt all the tension drain from my body and didn't want to do anything else that day but being near to the medina, shopping was a must before our departure back to the UK. After the spa we had a lovely Moroccan lunch and of course the famous Moroccan mint tea on the terrace upstairs, in a private area. I can honestly say that this was one of the best spas I have been to and will definitely return again in the near future. This spa was recommended to me by a friend and I have since recommended 'Hammam Rosa Bonheur' to many others.Definitely one not to be missed :)"

Though I have visited a variety of spas/ baths / and massages this was my first time at a hammam so I can't really compare the experience. What I can say is that the staff was very helpful and friendly. Samir, one of the staff members, met us at a local landmark and walked us about 5 min or so through the streets and alleyways to the hammam entrance as it is difficult to find. Samir was a great host and so much fun. He was friendly and helped us feel welcomed over mint tea and cookies while we waited to begin our hammam experience. We were happy to see him reappear at dinner as he attended to us during our meal. Oh and bring a swimsuit. I made the assumption that we would be nude as that was my experience at other saunas and in fact, if you don't bring a swimsuit they ask that you were a little paper thong. This was not a big deal but my husband and I spent a good ten min laughing at each others \"new undergarments\". We were feeling pretty ridiculous. We were able to schedule a couples experience which was nice and went through the whole process together. The scrub is good and not too abrasive,...(not like a salt scrub at the Korean spa) . The best part was the massage. It was really thorough and lasted about 90 min. At the end of our massage we were offered our dinner on the terrace which was a great end to the day. We scheduled our services for the evening which was great after a long day of walking the souks. Dinner was great and was several courses of traditional Moroccan flare. Overall our experience lasted about 4 hours and we left feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. Thank you again!"

Hammam and massage 2h package is worth every penny. Hammam is managed by the charming Samira who, with her dedicated and very friendly staff really made us feel at home and paradise at the same time.

We had the special with the 2h 30 treatments and the meal. The food was beautiful and traditional.The therapists doing the treatments are amongst the best I have ever had and special mention for Samir who really looked after us with the dinner and was very interesting about his heritage. Samira, the owner, has a really hands on approach and as a result she has a fabulous, well run hamman that really hits the spot. We were a bit dubious about meeting their staff at a set location but that was unfounded. They met us on time and had a leaflet so we knew it was them. I would highly recommend."

It was my last day in Marrakech and I had not reserved in advance - I ended up finding this one and trying it out, not having any idea what to expect. Samir, one of the Riad's managers, met me and my fiance in the main square to help escort us into the quiet and cool Riad. Samir welcomed us in and offers of mint tea and cookies, and Samira the hostess helped explain what the hammam would be like since this was my first time. I was escorted down to the warm stone hammam area and offered a changing area. I had the place to myself. A woman started off with a black soap massage, left me a couple minutes to steam, massaged off all my dead skin (so cool!), then put on a masque. Afterwards when I went back upstairs to join my fiance I was offered a complementary foot bath/massage of rose and mint while drinking mint tea. I was so pleased with the whole show that I said \"I need to get myself one of those scrubbing mitts!\" and they gave me one for free! (Plus a complementary bottle of argan oil!) All in all I was super impressed and would recommend this experience in particular to first-timers. Thanks again Samir, Samira, and all of the hammam staff."

All reviews pointed to this place and I am so happy I listened. Pros: 1. My hammam was by myself. There were two rock slabs in the room so I imagine people could go together but I am happy I didn't have to.2. The attendants are attentive and respectful. They aren't just throwing water on you and scrubbing your skin off.3. The room was warm but there is a barrier between your skin and the rock.4. You're given a robe and plush slippers during transition from the hammam to the massage. 5. Massage is great but not for the modest. I'm sure you can be specific on areas to avoid, though. 6. There is a clean, modern shower to use after you're done. 7. Prices are very reasonable compared to other places and when you take personalization into count.8. You can pay in Euros or Moroccan dirham.9. My skin felt amazing after. I didn't even want to wash off the massage oil because I felt so rejuvenated. Con:1. This place is hard to find BUT if you email them they will meet you at Cafe France or somewhere in the main square to walk you over which is great.Overall, I left here feeling like a princess and will most definitely return if I am anywhere near Morocco."

The quiet, intimate surroundings immediately put you at ease. The spa offers a variety of services and special packages. I decided to splurge and went for the deluxe hammam and spa package, with a traditional Moroccan meal. It was an excellent value for the price.

I visited Hammam Rosa Bonheur on 26th March after a day sightseeing they were able to fit me in the evening at late notice (Riad initially contacted my first choice Heritage spa fortunately there was no availability). On arrival I was given minted tea, I was then taken downstairs to the steam room firstly water was poured over my body which felt like heaven. I cant remember the exact order but I was scrubbed with black soap and then separately a mask was applied to my body both products were left on my body for a set time before being washed off. After the second application the steam room heated up and got quite hot. Following this I was taken upstairs for a full body Argain oil massage with relaxing music playing in the background, this lasted for roughly one hour. The only minor complaints that I have was the background noise which was partly due to a 60th birthday celebration that was being held at venue. Following my treatments the group that were celebrating invited me to join them we ate cake, we danced and were entertained by the staff and a belly dancer. This was the perfect ending to an amazing first day.I left with a free bottle of Argan oil i'm unsure if this is standard or due to the party that was taking place. Yassine was lovely and after the party he walked me back to my Riad. Following this treatment my skin felt baby soft, I would definitely recommend Hammam Rosa Bonheur."

Next we started our range of treatments which were set in the authentic Riad in all privacy. The massage in particular was excellent and felt like it lasted forever! Even our less adventurous Italian parents for who we had organised this as a surprise loved all the treatments. After almost 3 hours of relaxation we ate a beautiful dinner on the rooftop terrace under moonlight-again in all privacy, accompanied by a beautiful maroccan wine. The whole experience left us so happy we joined Samira and the team for a dinner and drinks the next evening in one of their other Riads, which again did not disappoint. Next time we are in marrakech we are planning to rent a room with her and her team to again relive this true maroccan hospitality.

If you go for a hammam it's better to spend a little more and get a really good experience than save a couple pennies and get a sub-par hammam and massage. The hammam here was a private 2 person hammam, I do have to say they reallllllly scrub you down, I had so much dead skin! But you feel as smooth as a baby's bottom after! Everyone was very accommodating, always asking if the temperature was ok and were very polite. Be warned though they do scrub just about everywhere and you wear a cloth mesh underwear thing! The massage was beautiful! The argan oil mix they used was absolutely luscious! The massage tables are 2 metres away from the hammam room so it's all nice and private still.The only trouble might've been going to a different riad as these owners have several riads on opposite ends of the medina, I was using the Tripadvisor App and it thought it was in the other riad. But if you call ahead they can arrange to meet you in the square and from there it's only a 10min walk, no charge either! We did have to put all our belonging and clothes in a basket and leave them in a room but everything was the same when we went back to change :)Truly an amazing experience, I never wanted to leave! thanks!"

I had booked via email for my partner and I to have the Hammam and massage followed by a meal at the Riad.With so many establishments offering treatments it's difficult to know which to choose but from the moment we met Yassine outside the Palace Bahia, we were confident in our choice.The Riad is down some very narrow alleys off a Souk in the South of the Medina.On entering you are in a charming lounging are with an open log fire... Evenings in February are cold!We were taken downstairs to change and into the Hammam . Sluiced and soaped and left to simmer on a low heat. The warmth and steamy heat are very relaxing ... But next ... A very vigorous rubbing down with rough mitten, imagine a Brillo pad, leaving every inch of your skin exfoliated. Followed my more sluicing down. If that doesn't get your blood circulating, nothing will!We then went up stairs for a massage. Unlike any massage I've ever had. Over one and a half hours of total relaxation . No more \u00a375 for a back massage at the spa for me. Every muscle and every bone was tweaked and attended to. When the masseuse eventually whispered that she had finished , I looked at my watch. We had arrived at 5pm , it was now 8pm. Where had the time gone? We had been advised to leave most of the oil on, if possible,as it would continue to benefit our skin. There was a nice bathroom if you wanted to shower.It was then back downstairs where a table had been laid for us by the fire.We ate salads and olives, a wonderful Morrocan soup and then tagines. Followed by oranges and cinnamon. Wine is available to purchase. We paid just over 2000 drhms for a wonderfully relaxing experience.Lovely, small establishment with wonderful staff.Very highly recommended."

Very friendly and welcoming people and I would highly recommend a visit."

More expensive that your usual, but if you are a couple and don't relish spending time in separate areas, then go for this. Spent over 3 hours being pampered by extremely courteous ladies, nothing was too much trouble. Took combined meal package-excellent soup/salad/beef tagine - only wish we could have stayed longer but our flight called. Big thank you to all and especially Yacine for his gentle hospitality."

I don't use to really like massage but this time was fantastic and so relaxing. Unfortunately I lost a bracelet that was very dear to me. Samira (who I think is in charge of the hamman) was caring so much about this whole lost story. When I got back to England, I got a text from Samira telling me she found the bracelet. Two days after I received it by mail. I got really moved by everyone's kindness and generosity. I would recommend this place to anyone in Marrakech. It is very clean and you feel at home. Next time I go back to Marrakesh I will run back to this place to get another massage and hug Samira!"

Yassine is a friendly, easy going guy, and met me enthusiastically in front of our meeting point at the Palais Bahia. He then escorted me, while hauling my luggage to the hammam about 5 minutes away.The facilities are very clean, but be warned that its hard to expect complete silence in the medina. Anyway, I was greeted by a couple staff members, and they welcomed me with some mint tea while setting my bags aside.I was taken upstairs to the massage room, where I was instructed to change into this skimpy looking thong and bathrobe. Then I made my way back downstairs into what was a narrow sauna room for the hammam. After being splashed with some water, I was told to lie on my stomach on one of the counters, and man those things are extra warm, almost burning. The masseuse proceeded to splash more water, as well as some oils on me. Then came the gritty part where she scrubbed off dead skin. A whole lot of it. Geez I didn't realize I had that much. The next phase was going back up to the first massage room, where the actual massage started. It was very soothing, and had me almost falling asleep multiple times. Next thing I knew, she was working on my facial, massaging my body with more creams and oils, and just like that the experience was over. Time flew by so quickly!The meal was also amazing. Soup, eggplant salad, chicken tajine, and oranges with cinnamon made for a great last meal before leaving Marrakech. I was allowed to hang out for awhile after, and also drink more tea. Yassine then helped me take my bags to my taxi, and that was that.Great experience, great staff, and great food. Hammams are a must when visiting Maarakech, and I recommend Rosa Bonheur!"

Everyone was so warm and welcoming. The services and food were great- we did a package deal. It was by far the best meal we had on our journey and definitely best massages ever.

Mint tea after mint tea and even ended up staying for food, which by the way was the best food I had while in Morocco, and hosted by the best people I have met in Morocco! Can not say enough positive things about the family and the service and can only say you have to visit Rosa Bonheur and this will make your trip! Can't wait to go back and just want to say a huge thank you to everyone for the most amazing comforting time!

We've just got back to our riad and I must say, this has been the highlight of our tour so far, and well worth the money. What you get here is far more than a massage - it is half a days relaxation and dining experience. It starts with Yassine picking you up at palais balia and taking you to the riad. Then after some snacks you have the hammam. My wife was pregnant but Riam and the staff fully catered to making her as comfortable as possible throughout our stay - they even gave us a private room for the hammam so I could make sure she was ok. The massage was then also excellent, as was the facial (so my wife tells me - it was my first!). Then came the extraordinary part - just as you think you'll be hurried along, Yassine serves you a wonderful without a shadow of a doubt the best tagine we have ever had - we had the beef and the vegetable. Felt a little guilty that we stayed so long but Yassine was having none of it and even carried our entire meal downstairs after it got a little chilly outside, and put extra wood on the fire, to truly make us feel at home. Compliments to Yassine, our 2 masseuses, the cook and Riam - we both thoroughly recommend this package. Well done! And to husbands/boyfriends whose partners need a little love, this is an excellent find!"

It didn't disappoint us (Since it was our first time, we couldn't really compare with others and also don't know what to expect). The location was quite difficult to find but at the end with the help with the local and google map, we were able to manage to find it out. Otherwise, you could always call, they would always get someone to pick you up. It was in a small but cozy riad. The Masseurs were very professional. I feel very clean and all the dirts on my body gone after the heavy scrub! Although I think the waiting time in the sauna room was a bit too long after the black soap (before the scrub). So be aware that some are waiting time in the 45 min that is listed on the price list. The body massage and facial message were both very good. I enjoyed it a lot! It is highly recommended to have a short escape after walking & shopping in the busy and packed Marrakech!"

Having already had a very traditional hammam with the local ladies in Chefchoen (North Morocco) and a massage in Essouaria, I already knew what to expect from my experience. I actually visited the hammam the day before my visit to check it out given the feedback about it being hard to find! It is definitely hard to find, however if you call them, the very friendly Yassine (gentleman) will come and collect you. Even on the day BEFORE my hammam I was treated to exceptional hospitality by the family who run the hammam and other riads close by. I got to meet the boss, Samira and her sister Myriam, Yassine, Fatima & Aicha. They were all incredibly warm, friendly, genuine and welcoming. An absolute delight!I then returned for my appointment the next day and it's safe to say that all my expectations were well exceeded. I booked the full 95\u20ac package for 2.5 hours commencing at 11am and didn't leave until 4:30pm! I was the only client there so felt extremely special. I received the traditional hammam for 45 mins, a full body massage for 1hr 15mins & a facial for 30 mins. It was divine! I was given a robe and artificial underpants to wear during the entire treatment so you don't need to bring anything with you. The hammam warm room, massage room and the entire surroundings are very clean, sensual & inviting - perfect for relaxing. Included in the package is mint tea & biscuits on arrival, fresh orange juice after your hammam, a luxurious shower after all the treatments and a 3 course traditional Moroocan meal on the terrace to end. I could not have asked for a more perfect way to end my 3 weeks in Morrocco! Huge thanks and gratitude for everything. Fantastic value, don't think about it, just book it!"

We then had a glass of fresh orange juice before having the best massage I have ever had!! My mother and I have traveled all around the world for massage treatments and this was by the far the best ever. I wish we had more time to have more treatments!

They let you sweat in the steam room before washing you, applying the soap, sweating some more, the most vigorous scrub ever, a whole body mask, more sweating and more washing!

We actually tried to find it ourselves, which unless you're extremely intrepid and not shy about knocking on doors (the place is totally unmarked from the outside, and you have to deduce its address), I'd definitely recommend arranging to have Yassine come get you and escort you to them.Yessine is a wonderful host. We went for the whole package which took about 2.5 hrs I think. The hammam was definitely an experience and feels like you're shedding so many layers of skin...my skin was softer for weeks afterwards! And then after, getting massaged expertly...when we emerged from the lower level where the experience takes place...you feel like you're coming out of the earth and being reborn! Then we had an incredible meal that was the best we had in Marrakech. Home cooking, authentic, and delicious! I was like a noodle by the time we left. A happy, well-rubbed and well-fed noodle. Recommend."

And on one occasion the lady had to turn around and tell me in arabic to put my mouse back in the house. Which was a tad embarrassing. My Mrs found it hilarious!. The massage was very good. And the head massage was nice and relaxing. My Mrs found her massage a little hard, but they did a really good job overall and it was just what was needed.

My girlfriend and I visited this morning for a \"relaxing package\" - a hammam including a full-body 'mask' and an hour's massage for 500 MAD. The hammam was excellent - clean and hot, and the amount of dead skin the lady with the glove (one each, given to us when we left so you know they're clean when they start) managed to remove was frankly quite shocking. I left feeling I'd won a strangely enjoyable fight with an orbital sander. The massage was powerful - we'd picked \"Moroccan\" (other alternatives were relaxing or draining) and the young lady doing it managed to dig her knuckles and elbows into more knots than I thought possible. If you like a gentle, sweeping massage then Moroccan is not for you - I like a deep tissue massage given with gusto and this didn't disappoint. We'll go back again before we leave - and I'll probably take my own swimwear again, because the disposable pair you're given seem more like a small thong and don't cover much. Maybe I'm just too British!"

Hammam - scrub in a hot sauna Before getting in the hammam, we got changed in a tiny changing locker room. Slippers were a little bit old and oily. We both got scrubbed by only 1 lady instead of 2. We were lying down on anti slip mats on top of the marble, the scrub was great. We then got rinsed and she also washed my hair which I had no problem with since I had short hair. Before asking my gf she poured water all over her hair and then shampoo, there was no conditioner after that. I would suggest to train your staff to ask your clients before pouring shampoo all over their hair. What bugged me most was her soaking the mats and rinsing the platform while we were rinsing ourself. 1. She should do it after we leave the hammam 2. The way she rinsed it seemed really unhygienic. We weren't offered a towel to dry ourselves but a bath robe. My gf's hair was dripping, it was slippery walking to the foot massage area where we had a 3 min foot massage. Went upstairs afterwards and the massage was fantastic no complains at all. Highly recommend the massage, and I hope to see some improvements with the hammam in the near future. "

            "review": "Lovely authentic Moroccan hammam experience. Absolutely loved this place! My partner and I went on the final afternoon of our trip to Marrakech over the Easter weekend for the couples package (580 MAD). This included a hammam bath, a short foot massage while served Moroccan mint tea followed by a choice of three massages: traditional Moroccan, relaxing or draining for one hour. Most westerners will be unfamiliar with the concept of 'hammam' and what the procedure actually involves so I will try to clarify. The hammam is more commonly known in the West as a Turkish bath as its initial conception dates back to the Ottoman Empire where it served as place for social gathering, ritual cleansing connected to the Islamic faith (which necessitates spiritual and physical cleanliness) and an architectural witness to the sultan's greatness, power and wealth. However, as the nice lady who greeted us on reception pointed out, several Arabic countries have adopted their own variants of it and thus the Moroccan variant differs to that of the Turkish (i.e. the addition of a black soap scrub with a hessa glove). Upon arrival we were seated on a comfortable sofa and offered a menu of treatments. Although we had already made a booking and thus this could be considered as pushy by some, I thought it was innocent and actually quite thoughtful. We were then shown to a changing room with a bench, shower and lockers containing fresh dressing robes, sandals, sterile disposable hessa gloves and a pair of paper underwear which didn't leave much to the imagination (I'm not sure it would even sufficiently cover more well-endowed gentlemen!) but my suggestion would be if you are not comfortable with this you could always bring bathing trunks (or bikini bottoms for the girls) but other guests will not see anything anyway. On leaving the changing room we were directed through a low-lit, curtained corridor to the hammam. This was a single room tiled with beautiful marble, a large inset basin full of hot water fed by ornate taps, a dousing bowl and a pot of black soap plus candles. The best way I can describe it is like a milder version of a Finnish sauna - dry heat but nowhere near as hot and it wasn't at all like a steam room (i.e. misty and humid with wet heat). The attendant was a lovely motherly lady who couldn't speak much English but understood my rubbish French and always had a big smile. She pasted us with a surprisingly sparse amount of black soap and instructed us to lay face down on the benches and relax in the warmth before leaving. We stayed like this for half an hour or so before she returned and scrubbed us down with our own gloves (the amount of dead skin that comes off will surprise you!). She then covered us in some sort of moisturising balm which smelled of orange blossom and shampooed/head massaged our hair all throughout dousing us at regular intervals using the bowl and hot water from the basin. She then left us again to soak our feet in a wooden foot bath containing cold water with rose petals for another 20 minutes. Finally, she returned (she was going between the different hammam rooms along the corridor with other guests) and told us to stand under a cool shower in the centre of the room. We then robed-up and left the room to sit on cushioned recliners in the lounge to be served mint tea along with another couple. Shortly, another four ladies appeared to sit on stools at the foot of each recliner and give a short (less than five minutes) foot massage. After this we were led upstairs to a massage suite and asked which of the aforementioned massages we would like (we both chose the relaxing). Note: the Moroccan massage may seem like the authentic option (and is exactly and only what you would be offered if you went to one of the public hammams) but it is not for the faint of heat and typically involves a bit of contortionism and rough handling. The massage itself was great (full-body back and front) and the therapist was friendly. After it had finished we were again left to relax for a few minutes before returning to the dressing room. A shower at this stage before getting dressed is definitely recommended as you are covered in oil but the only complaint I have is that this was barely possible for us as the shower pressure on the hot water was practically non-existent (a trickle at best). Although the couple in the changing room next door didn't seem to have this problem. On exiting the two masseuses who had been chatting with their colleagues in the lounge area hurried over. Initially I just thought they were being friendly/attentive but it was only after I left did it dawn on me they were expecting tips and I felt bad I hadn't obliged. Nonetheless, a separate lady now on reception who was just as friendly as the first asked us if we had enjoyed the experience and seemed genuinely concerned that our expectations had been met. We exited into the bright daylight feeling super relaxed and contented. Overall, I absolutely recommend this experience to couples and groups. While you could go solo (especially for the hammam) the massage may feel a little awkward for a young man. One final thing I will point out is the experience you get at an establishment like this (i.e. a hammam/spa geared towards tourists) is totally different to what you would get at one of the local/public hammams. These are most certainly only for the very bravest and are not as well-kept (they get much more traffic though). Segregation is obviously enforced and as a tourist you will stand out a lot (particularly if you don't go in completely naked) you would also be expected to bring your own black soap and glove (available cheaply from the souks - 5 MAD for 100g soap) or the option to purchase on-site is available at some public hammams. You would also be expected to pay the attendants for scrubbing you down and twisting/pulling you around. There are many private hammam-spas available in Marrakech so it can be difficult to make the right choice, every single one will offer a subtly different experience but one thing is for sure, if you choose Les Bains de Azahara you will not be disappointed!"

I chose it as it was close enough to the hotel, and the taxi could get quite close to drop me off - I didnt have to walk through windy roads within the MedinahThe lights and ambiance were soft and set the mood for relaxation. I was able to book easily over the phone and at reception there was a warm welcome.The experience itself was as expecte d- generous use of mask/scrub, vigorous scrub, but you feel so pampered and cleansed after! I had to keep telling them to go more firm on the massage - it was good but I didn't feel they got into some of my knots so the massage part for me was a bit lacking.Be prepared- one of the girls will whisper to you that you can offer the famous tip -so keep some change with you as they will \"expect\" something. Easy to find- just by Doukkala mosque. Taxis on the return can be caught just a short walk down the street.Good value for money - I paid a bit more and it was worth it."

We had the hammam to begin with, we were washed with warm water and then covered in a soap scrub, this was left on our skin for a little while and we were left to relax in the steam room. We were then scrubbed, this was a nice experience and not rough. We were then washed off and had our faces and hair washed before sitting with our feet in a warm bowl of water with rose petals. We sat in the \"waiting area\" and had a quick foot massage before being taken upstairs for a 1 hour whole body massage, when they say while they mean whole so be prepared. We both opted for the Moroccan massage. This was lovely and they kept asking if we were OK throughout. Overall this was a very relaxing experience and would recommend, could not fault the price at about \u00a360 for the both of us!! Great service from all staff throughout"

We weren't 100% sure what to expect, so I hope this review will help anyone else visiting. We got a cab to drop us outside, (50 dirham from Jemaa El Fna) but walked back afterwards and it's a short walk (10 minutes max) from the main square and just around the corner from Koutoubia Mosque. We opted for the 400 dirham spa package that includes use of the hammam, a black eucalyptus scrub, short foot massage and then an hour long full body massage. This is without a doubt an excellent deal at around \u00a327. Robes, and flip flops are provided, along with some very skimpy paper pants, so I would recommend bringing your own bikini bottoms or a change of underwear. We were greeted by a member of staff who sat us down and talked us through the whole experience as I had never visited a hammam before. She answered all of our questions and was very welcoming. We were advised of a 15 minute wait and she then took us into the changing room where we were each provided with a locker.We then went and sat in a relaxation area, were offered mint tea and waited for the treatment. We were then taken into the hammam together, and the first part of the treatment started. Be aware that it is all topless. It was lovely and warm, the treatment was bliss and my friend and I left feeling pampered already. Be prepared to be amazed (and kind of disgusted) at how much dead skin will be exfoliated off of you. This part was concluded with shampooing your hair and a quick rinse off before being taken back to the relaxation area. We were given more mint tea and a short foot massage. We then went upstairs where we were given incredible hour long massages which included the face and head. I asked for a bit more pressure and the masseuse happily obliged. They checked throughout that we were comfortable, which we definitely were. We were then left to chill in the room for 10 minutes before being led back to the changing room where there was the option of having a shower, we chose to soak up the oil and left feeling wonderful!The whole experience was incredible, the staff were so friendly and helpful, the spa itself is clean and beautifully decorated, and the massage and hammam experience were expertly carried out with high quality products. This will be a memorable highlight of our trip to Marrakech, and we cannot recommend it enough."

Our innkeeper at Riad Tizwa made all the arrangements for us to come to this hammam, and walked us there. To save time I will echo the review recently written by Carla C - exact same experience. We both loved it and found it very relaxing; in addition, the price/value was quite good. If I were to return I would ask for a second mat to lay on, as the bed was quite hot and it took me a while to acclimate. Two layers may have helped me. My only complaint - and it's minor - is that when we were taken to the room for our foot treatment, the two girls were just hanging out listening to their ipods - did not welcome us or even smile. Eventually one got up and served us hot tea, then they began the foot massage. I just think the ipod-listening should be done outside of view of clients. All that said, I would definitely return to this spa. We had no other treatments there - just the hammam."

The women who work there are really nice and sweet, although their English isn't great, but just pointing and some French was enough. I would really recommend this. O and some advise, just wear the weird white underpants-thingy they give you, it's awkward at first, but swimwear would just be in the way with the hammam and the massage."

Having been advised by a colleague, who's previously been to this amazing country, that a \"hammam\" is a must do experience, we booked a two hour session. I don't have a means of contrasting this place to any of the others within the city, so all I can contribute here is how the whole experience felt. You are greeted by a very courteous staff, who take you to change into your robe. The next stage is where you enter a room with three matts protruding from the stone walls for you to stretch out upon. The lady rinses you down with water, then scrubs you down with an exfoliating glove, which you get to keep, then applies an aromatic oil to your skin. You lie down, and they leave the room, and steam begins to fill the chamber. After ten or so minutes, the lady returns to have you rinse at the shower in the front corner of the chamber. Next, she applies the \"black soap\" which is the medium for extracting the toxins from your pores. You lie back down, and steam returns. I could literally feel the toxins leaving my skin. One of the ladies we visited with, said she could see them on the surface of her body during the process. I'm not sure exactly how long you are in this state, but long enough where I was sweating profusely. Repeat the rinsing at the shower, towel off, then leave that chamber to relax in a cool chase with some water and mint tea...upstairs for a massage, then your session is complete. Even a day later, my skin feels like butter. The locals visit the public hammam's once a week, and I believe it is a big reason their beauty is preserved for such a long period of their life..."

We booked the 400dh pp special online which included Hamman, body scrub, foot massage and 1hr massage. English was very limited, however this did not cause any issues as we hadn't gone there for a chat. Earlier in the week we had been to a Hamman in Essouira recommended to us by staff at our Riad, that was nowhere near to the standard of Les Bains de Azahara and it cost us 350 just for the Hamman and massage.

The staff in here are so gentle and nice. It was beyond a doubt the best massage I have ever had in my entire life. The hammam experience was so relaxing and we felt a million dollars leaving this place. It is by far the best thing we have done in Marrakech and I cannot recommend this place highly enough- it was so luxiourios, so professional and staff were wonderful! We will be back!"

I had a Moroccan massage which is not for the faint hearted but you can have a relaxing massage if you want and it hey will change it to whatever level you like. This is definitely a tourist Hammam rather than a local so the prices match this but saying that I was there for 2hrs and it was 400dh (special morning rate) which is about the cost of a massage only in the uk. I would certainly recommend the aromatic rub with the Hammam this was lovely. Great think to do if you want to get away from the bustling streets of Marrakech and treat yourself"

It appears you shouldn't go to Morocco without trying a Hammam and around Marrakesh there are many municipal Hammams to choose from, but this one is private and just around the corner from our Riad (Altair) and as we were 'first timers' we felt we wanted a more luxurious/private experience than that which we may have got in a municipal Hammam. We also met a couple who recommended the hammam to us which also gave us the confidence to give it a go!For me I went for a Hammam and foot massage for 300dh and it was the most bizarre experience I have ever had! I just couldn't believe that at the age of 44 years I was being given a bath by someone - as this is basically what a hammam is. You strip to nothing apart from a pair of paper pants, plastic slippers and a robe and then they take you into a room with heated ceramic beds and you are splashed with bowls of water and then have various lotions and potions quickly massaged onto your skin and they are either left a while to do their magic or washed off immediately. At one stage your skin is roughly sloughed by the person performing this and it is quite surprising to see how much dead grey skin is produced and then washed off. It was lovely and warm in the room (a little like a sauna), with dim lighting and soft music and this treatment also included bathing my feet in cold water with rose petals and afterwards it followed with mint tea and a wonderful foot massage. Had I known more of what to expect I may have relaxed more, but all in all it was an amazing experience that I would definitely repeat both generally and at this Hammam. The receptionist spoke good English and the other staff mainly French. My husband opted for a relaxing full body massage which didn't involve any water and was simply a massage using massage oils, but he thoroughly enjoyed the experience and said the masseuse was very professional, put him at ease and he felt very relaxed afterwards."

The lady who received us was probably the one that has confirmed the mail and she was not at all sorry and very rude.

Of the 45 mins of hammam, I counted 10 mins pp of the staff providing service. Then we were moved to get the foot massage, this was actually a 3 mins sloppy massage with the girls being occupied with some staff intrigues happening that day. We picked the Moroccan massage that was very good and the girls stepped up. Other: There were a couple of things I discovered with this place. There are mixed changing rooms also vey small and cold (we did not eager for a shower after treatment to say the least), slippers given were dirty, candels were not lit in hammam room, shared bucket used for foot bath and wet towel at the massage bench (from other guests?!).Think you can find something better \u263a"

We went for what was 3 hours worth of treatments and came out after 5 hours so definitely got our monies worth. I wouldn't recommend the manicures as they aren't of a very high standard compared to English standards. They chipped quickly and the colours on offer are limited. I definitely recommend all other treatments. We had a fantastic afternoon here!"

We proceeded to have a romantic bath. Baths were covered in rose petals and smelled amazing. We were left on our own to relax. 15 minutes later two ladies came in with cold bottled water (which was very much appreciated) and proceeded to give us the best head and shoulder massage I\u2019ve ever had! These ladies then helped us get dressed and finish off the session by a gentle foot rub as we were having yet another cup of mint tea.If we weren\u2019t in heaven already, we were then taken upstairs for a whole body drainage massage. My masseuse had very knowledgeable hands and was working her way through all my lymph nodes.

I mean location, cleanliness , price vs. quality should be emphasized, and here wins Les Bains D ` Azahara. This is the real deal!You will meet with a quiet professional lady who gives the peace you want. RELAX!You are then ushered into a dressing room where you leave your clothes in a locked cabinet. We have been here six times and this is one hundred percent safe. Then it's into a small sauna. Here you lie down and feel the heat rising in the body. You are then washed and scrubbed by a strong girl in the 20s. You feel the old junk disappear from your skin .After extensive rinsing carries for 15 minute foot massage cup classic Moroccan tea. Soothing tones fills your ears and your employees whispers so you will go best possible rest. The venue is an old almost country-house style with a sleek dark wood interiors, and the smell is nice.

They give you everything you need so no need for bikini, etc. Lovely surroundings & very sweet women working there."

Me and my husband went to this Hammam for a nice relaxing morning treat during our 3 days stay in Marrakech.We have decided to take a Spa package for 350 MAD per person.The experience was truly amazing. The place itself its clean, smell lovely and ladies are all very nice and welcoming. You don't feel embarrassed or intimated.We have brought our own swimming shorts and slippers but everything was provided.We had skin exfoliation with olive black soap - all dead skin went off, then we got a warm cup of mint tea and a feet message. The best part was 1 hour relaxing body message.After all this you can feel like a new born person and skin is so soft and shiny.Thank you very much for a lovely experience we will be back and highly recommend to everyone visiting the city."

The treat at Les Bains de Azahara was perfect, the personal was professional and kind, the decoration invitingly beautiful! At this cozy place you get luxury treatment for a VERY reasonable price. The owner attended us herself and gave us insight of the day-to-day life in Marrakesh which was worth itself the visit! My husband and I will be eternally grateful for having found this place in the maze of Moroccan streets."

We decided to go between the hours of 10-2pm as Les Bains offers a special during those hours for a package hammam and one hour massage for 350 dirhams (which is considerably less than other spas that we looked into before we decided to go to Les Bains).The Hammam was very relaxing and all four of us had a fun time getting scrubbed, etc. My wife and I then went upstairs for an hour massage while some of the ladies who worked at the hammam watched our two young children. We ordered the Moroccan massage and it was terrific.All in all, we had a great time at Les Bains and we would highly recommend it for families as children are welcome and are well taken care of. We believe it was a great value for the money (we spent two hours there) and the staff was very friendly and professional and the hammam was extremely relaxing and serene."

On the basis of this i booked in for another massage later in my holiday and requested the same therapist.That is where my experience differs.I had never seen the therapist before and when I mentioned this there seemed to be a lack of understanding of what I was talking about. The massage was mediocre, the pressure wishy washy and my time was cut short. I was in and out of the hamman - changed massaged within 50 minutes instead of the hour I had paid for.Complain - I did but again there seemed to be a communication problem ie. no understand much english"

I'm not sure how hygienic the facilities were - they seemed to reuse the same exfoliating glove on me and my friend (and who knows how many others) without rinsing it, they exfoliated me on the same surface as her without washing away her dead skin first and everyone seemed to lie on the same massage table without a change of towels. But it was a very relaxing experience and a bargain at 550DH for over 2 hours of pampering."

The owner was apologetic and did not charge us, other than the initial deposit fee of 200 Dhs. We went back a week later hoping to have our relaxing treatments and were not disappointed. The draining massage was very good and my legs felt revived after a week of lots of walking around Marrakech. My friend fell asleep during her relaxing massage, so it worked.

The Les Bains de Azahara were the second spa that we went to and we had the same treatment as before but it was half price of what we had payed at the other spa. Comparison and description:We didn't get free slippers and underwear. (So, bring a second slip! Shoes are optional. You don't need them.)My boyfriend and I had a private hammam and the lady who did the treatment was amazing! Instead of using a water jet she scooped water on us. That was so much more relaxing! The room was very nice and traditionally decorated. The srubbing was really intense. In the more expensive spa it was more relaxing - but only because she did hardly scrub half of my body. In this spa the lady scrubbed every bit and was very accurat. I loved it, although it makes your skin burn. :-)Before standing up we got a bucket with cool water and rose peddals to put our feet into. That way my blood circulation was stimulated and I didn't have any problems when I left the room. (I nearly fainted in the other spa.)We were brought to a relaxation area. and got some tea. After a couple of minutes two younger woman came to give us a foot massage which is included. It was really relaxing and I liked the fact that they treated my boyfriend and me at the same time. Although the girls were chatting while doing the massage, I didn't feel disturbed. I think it was more authentic that way. The only negative things: - There was no hair dryer, although they had a shower in the private changing rooms. I was glad, our hotel was only about 100 m from the spa.- You could here the people and cars on the street while being in the spa. It wasn't very loud, but I which, they had a door to seperate the reception an dhallway from the other parts of the spa to keep the noise out."

The spa itself was slightly shabby, the changing area cramped, but for me the biggest negative was the noise. After having the Hamman treatment, which was just ok (the room was too bright), I was then shown into the quiet room for a foot massage and some mint tea. In theory this sounds wonderful, but it was impossible to relax because the room was anything but quiet, I could hear everything that was happening at the reception, including a large group of Dutch tourists trying to make appointments. I then had a Moroccan massage which would have been relaxing if it hadn't been for the street noise, the motor bikes were very loud and I could even hear conversations from the passersby, so I found it impossible to switch off and enjoy.If you want to have a luxurious, total chill out experience then try Les Bains."

After the glowing reviews, I was really looking forward to the experience, especially having enjoyed excellent hamams at other spas on previous visits.Unfortunately, the whole experience was very underwhelming. The lady who did the 'scrubbing' in our wet-room didn't use any olive soap (so it was a bit 'dry' and ineffective) and she rushed through the 4 of us about 10 minutes quicker than the other group of 3 people (who did have olive soap, bizarrely).After the hamam, I was looking forward to the relaxing mint tea and foot-rub on the lounge-beds. Instead, all the masseuse girls were talking loudly to each other during the massage, and two of them were sending and receiving text messages while actually giving the massage. The whole impression was of employees who didn't really care - completely at odds with previous hamams that I've experienced.A real shame, especially as it was the first hamam for most of the group, and the experience was, at best, mediocre. Maybe it was a one-off (the other reviews suggest it was), but I doubt that I'd return to give them the benefit of the doubt."

After a bit of a trek from our riad (in the south of the medina), we found it tucked away down a back street. We both had a traditional hammam which was amazing; the lady that bathed and scrubbed us was like a small machine! She got into every nook and cranny and didnt hold back. We then had a massage and a pedicure... They where ok but nothing compared to the actual hammam and on reflection if we were to go again we would just have the hammam and not bother with the massage or the pedicure...

The staff were welcoming and friendly, and some even spoke some English which was helpful even though we could speak some French. It smells divine and is relaxing and cool (air conditioned) as soon as you enter. You do get changed into a paper thong and nothing else (as with all/most hammams) and as I went with a friend we did get to know each other a whole lot better. The girl doing our hammam was great and although we got a touch of the giggles over our state it was a very relaxing and amazing experience - I want to go again! You get to relax with some mint tea after too. Head upstairs on these tiny stairs to the massage rooms which again was fantastic and so relaxing. Still in the paper thong so really just be prepared to not really think about your bits all exposed all the time!

The massage was exceptional - not rushed, perfect pressure, choice of oils and the lovely lady giving the massage was professional and smiley and therefore I was able to properly relax and enjoy the fabulous massage in the wonderful dark room. After the massage I met my daughter in the spa waiting area where we enjoyed a shot of fruit juice and some beautifully presented fruit before swapping over treatments. My daughter said her skin felt like a new born baby and her face was radiant also. Before the Hammam say goodbye to your old skin because you will never see it again! It is a wonderful Hammam experience and again the lady (so sorry I can't remember your names) was lovely, smiley, professional and super strong at scrubbing your body until you almost feel reborn. We both absolutely loved it at Spa MK and I think you really do get what you pay for here. We felt really pampered and special. Yes, you could get a couple of mediocre Hammam packages elsewhere for the price of this one - but I choose quality over quantity every time. After this place I would be disappointed anywhere else. Thank you to the Spa MK team. You're the best."

It was fantastic. I wish I had the money to actually stay at this riad. It was so lovely! There would have been nothing they could have done to make my time here more enjoyable. I wish I could smell that way all of the time. It's more a blend of east and west so if you're looking for some girthy Berber woman to scrub you with a hedgehog, this is not your place. The hammam is fairly traditional minus the rose petals on everything. I was in heaven."

It consists of two parts (45' each one), one is a relaxing massage and the other one is a real hammam bath, so everyone starts with one of the two activities. For the massage you can choose several kind of aroma oils including the Argan Moroccan famous oil. They give you the massage in a dark and relaxing environment and you feel so well after. On the other side, for us that used to call to the Arabic baths as Hamman, it was a surprise when we entered in a small room without pools. And this is the real hammam, a Moroccan traditional purifican bath given in a warm and wet room. It consists of several baths and skin exfoliations and at the end, your skin is totally soft and renewed. A unique and wonderful experience, to be repeated from time to time."

Not only was it incredibly relaxing and in a lovely setting, we came out feeling cleaner and smoother than ever before, scrubbed like a baby by the wonderful hammamiste Fatiha. This was followed by the most relaxing massage I've ever had, with a lovely choice of oils, by another lovely lady, Samia. This experience is an absolute must, and great way of relaxing before an afternoons shopping in the souks. Not to be missed!"

Spa MK offers a relaxing and luxurious experience. We had the East-West combination - my unsuspecting husband was lulled into a massage-induced stupor and was then sloshed awake next door by the hammamiste, whilst I made sure I had the hammam first and could then float away for the rest of the evening, oil-scented and relaxed. In this package the treatments are done completely privately; you can take your own undies or swimwear; and they provide robes, slippers, a hairdryer and snacks. There was plenty of giggling from the hammam room - inevitably having a bowl of warm water emptied over your head is funny, and the hammamiste is good-humoured and has a laugh with you. The masseuse is equally lovely - just the right amount of chat and engagement whilst remaining respectful. All in all, a very lovely experience."

To me, the spa was just a room to the side that they'd set up to make a bit of extra cash and not a focus what-so-ever of the experience. At one point during my hammam, I was so cold and kept telling the kind hammam lady \"j'ai froid!!\" because she was opening and closing the door so often and would just leave me alone for ages. We could have just done the (amazing) dinner at 650 dirhams a head (separate review) and saved ourselves the poor to average hammam and massage and just had a good dinner. I had several other hammams while in Marrakech and am a frequent visitor to spas, so I feel confident in my assessment that this is the least focus of this property."

As we arrived a little early we were offered mint tea and oranges while we waited and it gave us a chance to soak up the beautiful surroundings. The spa session was a hammam and massage, one of you has the hammam, the other the massage and then swap. The staff were lovely, very attentive and the massage was pure bliss. After you are given time to dress and get ready before going to the roof garden for drinks and canapes. The terrace gave excellent view all across the city at night. A fire was blazing to keep you warm and blankets were offered for all those feeling a little chilly. After choosing main course we were escorted back downstairs for a 5 course meal. The food was simply delicious and very well presented. This really was a holiday highlight and a definite must do for those who enjoy a pamper, great food and excellent service. I cannot reccomend enough."

The surroundings are wonderful, the hammam and spa room felt luxurious and relaxing and the therapists were very good. The roof terrace that we had afternoon tea on was lovely, with great views over Marrakech. The afternoon tea itself was OK but not amazing, I found the cakes a bit over-sweet and the sandwiches a little dry. The scones however were delicious. It's not cheap but I would recommend the spa for a real treat in Marrakech, but perhaps without the afternoon tea."

If you want one place to go for a spa without breaking the bank on the five star hotel spas, go straight to Roukia, the highly skilled and experienced therapist at Spa MK. I tried massages in three more reasonably priced places in Marrakech, two of which had nice settings but were disappointing treatments by ladies without a lot of experience of what an international clientele expect, including the highly rated and otherwise lovely and gracious Heritage Spa. The difference at Spa MK is Roukia's magic hands. She has firm pressure and knows where the muscles are, a rare skill in Marrakech. She leaves you transformed. Her relaxing facials use all natural ingredients and include a massage during the mask. Highly recommended."

It basically consists of having a lot of buckets of warm water chucked over you, then a scrub with black soap, an exfoliation with a mitt ,a mud mask, argan oil in your hair, and then more buckets of warm water. When you leave you feel totally relaxed and your skin and hair have never felt softer. The massage was also very good. A great thing to do after a morning spent walking round the souks."

The spa at MK is small but perfectly formed - we trudged in out of the rain and were met by Hanane, who graciously showed us around the riad and chatted to us while showing us the spa. It's very small but pretty and very very clean. Lovely dark and restful hamman room where I was scrubbed and splashed with great gusto by the lovely lady looking after me. I fell asleep when she left me in there for 5 minutes before scrubbing my hair and tipping more water over me - brilliant. Then out to the waiting room for a cool sorbet and a little rest before going into the pretty massage room for a superb massage that really made me forget all my aches and pains! Each treatment was 45 minutes and the 2 ladies who worked there were brilliant. Even my boyfriend agreed it was wonderful (and he's not a massage type of guy). Sure you can probably go to cheaper places but our whole MK experience was so fab, we didn't mind spending the money on such a grand time. Just what we both needed on our first day in Marrakech.

We tried \u201cevening pampering package\u201d, which is 45 minutes Hammam + 45 minutes Massage + 5 course dinner (EUR 220 for 2 people, drinks not included \u2013 remember this price is NOT per person!). It was definitely inexpensive for the treatment, food and service we received.It is not easy to find MK, but there is a very detailed description how to get, so I strongly recommend to print out and take it with you (home --> information & downloads (on the bottom) --> PDF documents --> map & directions for maison mk, gastro mk & spa mk) . Anyway, if you still have difficulties, ask someone the direction of a shop called \u201ckif kif\u201d rather than MK.Basically, entrance is all the same for Riad, Spa and restaurant. But spa has its own area inside of Riad.Since the spa is small, only two people can enter at once. You have separate changing room and can leave your belongings inside.You do not need to bring anything with you (unless you need fresh underwear, make up, hair gel, hair brush, etc). Flip flops and bikini pants will be provided by spa.Both hammam and massage rooms are only for one person. It means one must start with hamann and the other with massage. In between you have short break with refreshment, then visa versa afterwards. Since I personally think hammam \uf0e0 massage order is better, it was pity. Massage was very fine and professional - I would have rather preferred little stronger, but my wife liked it very much. Before the massage you can choose which oil you would like her to use (there were four choices). Massage room had dark and relaxing atmosphere.In hammam they wash you three times (hope I am not mistaken). You will be really clean \u2013 it is good to wash out all the dust and sweat from Souk! If someone has dry skin, I rather recommend to start with hammam. Otherwise better to take skin cream, if you finish with hammam. Inside of the hammam is very hot, so you will be sweating a lot by the end. You will receive ice-cold mineral water afterwards to cool down \u2013 they really think a lot for you.Inside of the spa is very clean. The staff is very professional and the package price was more than fair. We enjoyed it very much and felt like a new born baby afterwards. I do not speak much French, but I did not feel any inconvenience. Although we were not the guest of Riad, we were treated so well both in spa and restaurant.

The weather was especially hot when we stayed at Maison MK, and I am also pregnant, so my husband and I opted out of the Hammam option and went for a massage. It was nice to have a massage as an afternoon treat after walking around all morning. I have only had a massage in the U.S., so it was a bit different than what I was used to/expected. It seemed to be focused more on oil application than tissue massage, and I was also a bit more \"exposed\" than I am used to. :) But, that being said, it was still an enjoyable experience. Reading the reviews, it seems like the Hammam is more of their specialty. The Maison is beautiful, and I would imagine it to be a more hygenic/upscale environment than most spas in Marrakech."

The staff were friendly and professional. We had a hamam and massage, I did one first and my daughter the other then we swapped over. The Riad was stunning and can appreciate exactly what the owners and staff are trying to achieve. I met the owner on a second visit to the Riad to purchase some gifts for friends back home and he was delightful and charming. Nothing is too much bother for these guys and they have thought of everything. I hope to go back soon and stay overnight with my husband... as this time he was unable to travel with us. I am hoping I can get him to use the spa facilities but if not he will certainly enjoy the food and ambience. This place is a must when you visit Marrakech. Thankyou once again to the owners and staff for a wonderful day. (see seperate review re Gastro MK.)"

Service was excellent and the inside of the Spa itself is amazing to behold. They really did a great job redecorating / renovating (read the history of the place in the book while waiting).The dinner on the other hand was not good. Drinks and canap\u00e9s were nice, up on top of the beautiful terrace bar. They came and took out dinner choices and we were settling in for a beautiful evening watching the sun set over Marrakesh, then confusingly we get moved downstairs to the back of the reception / spa in the dinning area. It just didn't make sense. The food itself was trying way to hard and even stranger had only the remotest connections to Moroccan cuisine. It didn't really help that I was violently ill the following day and missed most of the last day in Marrakesh....I can't say for definite this was from the fish I had but my partner had the lamb and was fine, having eaten exactly the same as me all day except that meal.Overall the spa is above average but let down by food that is trying way to hard (I had a meal 5 times better in the central square at a stall for less the 10% of the price 2 nights earlier) and slightly overpriced. Worth a visit for the spa though. I would have give the Spa a very good (although just about)."

Although you are paying a lot more for a hammam, this certainly adds that extra sense of relaxation, knowing that your personals are in kept in safe surroundings, and that the levels of hygiene are top notch.I went for a popular combo of a luxury hammam and relaxing massage. The 'gommage' was sensational, being scrubbed with black soap, then having a rhasoul mud mask, then a sugar scrub, whilst your hair was having an Argan oil conditioning treatment. Buckets of perfectly hot water were poured onto you inside a perfectly steamed atmosphere. Other than having to turn your body over a couple of times, you didn't have to lift a finger!A quick shot of fruit juice and delicate slices of fruit.  If that wasn't enough, you have a 45 min relaxing massage. A candle scented and lit room, the massage was indeed relaxing, with the perfect ambience, almost sending me fall into a deep sleep.A brilliant hour and a half spent in luxurious surroundings for a reasonable price (especially compared to some other packages I'd seen elsewhere). Unfortunately, after all the treatment, you are then plummeted back into the noisy, crazy life that is Marrakech!"

A must is the hamam experience where you start in a steam room and are washed and scrubbed and polished and get an argan oil hair treatment, then massaged beautifully in the next room till you fall asleep - divine. Its good to do with a friend so you can share the experience ( and your reactions to the hamam- I won't spoil it by saying more!)Waxing was very efficient and thorough and professional. Same goes for the manicure and pedicure. The nail polish colours were very tempting (Essie !) but it was nice to see that there was no extra charge for a French manicure. So those were the necessary treatments for me but I would have happily had everything on the long menu if I had more time there."

I was lucky enough to have been a guest at the Maison MK, but I would have ventured through the winding alleys of the medina simply for the spa itself! I enjoyed a 45 minute full body massage followed by a 45 minute himam treatment. The massage was very relaxing and the room was perfectly heated. 45 minutes didn't seem like nearly enough time, I could have laid there forever! Next was my himam treatment, a typical Moroccan washing. It was quite different from any spa treatment I have ever received before... and it was much better! For 45 minutes, I laid in a heated, stone room on a thin yoga-like mat as hot water was continuously poured over my body, followed by such treatments as a sugar exfoliation or an argan oil rub. My hair was washed and conditioned as well. It was arguably the most relaxing, refreshing, and enjoyable 45 minutes of my life! It was very reasonably priced, I paid only 60 euro for both treatments combined. In between, I was served freshly sliced oranges sprinkles with cinnamon. I highly recommend the spa services of Spa MK to anyone and everyone."

Small I have to say, but perfect. The spa girls were very pleasant, smiling eyes and my girl was very gentle with me. I went through one procedure after another, douche, wash, massage, exfoliate, scrub, wash again, mask, and lots of washing and I think another layer of beautifying and hair shampooing (which seemed to be optional).So all in all a thoroughly cleansing and relaxing experience. I have been to Marrakech 3 times already and had a hammam each time. This one tops the lot because of all the little details and the extra care taken. Back home, Christmas shopping, and it all seems so long ago & far away. I promised I would write a review, so now i can feel less guilty. I wish i could go back because I feel all grubby again."

Sadly i fell asleep during the massage so I missed some of it, but i think that shows how relaxing it was."

I did not see the Riad as we were taken through to wait for our treatments, the area for the treatments that I saw was very small, and not much room to get changed etc. However the staff were lovely and while we waited we were given some water to drink. The treatment was first class and I recommend everyone to try the Hammam, I could have lay there all day and been scrubbed and washed - very relaxing experience. After I had a full body massage which was a perfect way to finish off the treatment. In between the treatments we were also given some water and fruit - which was a nice touch whilst we sat in our robes. Overall a good experience and just what is needed to take a moment to relax in the hectic city of Marrakech."

It is a little difficult to find but worth the effort. The evning began with drinks on the terrace which has great views of the mosque. Dinner was then served in an intimate and romantic room. Everything from the bread through to the dessert was incredible, and by far the best food we had in Marrakech. The chef Omar also paid us a visit at the end of the meal which we thought was a nice touch. The spa was also fantastic, although it would have been nice if both myself and my Partner could have had treatments at the same time but as there was only one room this wasn't possible. Nevertheless the facial and massage we had were very relaxing and professional. Overall, highly recommended!"

I didn't know what to expect other than quite a basic scrub and rub down. It turned out to be much more than that and more luxurious than I thought. There's quite a ritual involved. My skin was prepared really thoroughly before the scrub after which I was quite suprised to see how much dead skin came off! The clay mask after this was gorgeous as was the massage with the cedar oil & scrub. My skin felt beautifully smooth and moisturised afterwards. I felt comfortable with the therapist and it's clear that she is quite experienced doing the Hammam. My facial was equally memorable. The beautician had a lovely aura about her and made me feel so calm and relaxed. I received a wonderful massage not only on the face but on my feet whilst the mask was taking effect. This was a welcome surprise as I felt as if I had reflexology treatment included for free. She really had a special touch and was very professional and caring. They say 'Good things come in small packages' and I would certainly say that about the spa in maisonmk."

We were greeted by Mary, who manges the Riad and was very friendly and proved a charming host. Riads are small and as such the spa area was also of the diminutive variety but comfortable and relaxing. My massage was good although I would not rate it as one of the best I have had, that still goes to the various Banyan Tree spas that we have visited and who I our experience are unrivalled. My wife reported that she enjoyed her massage and she also had an additional 15 minute foot massage tacked onto the main relaxation massage and found that to be really good.The Hamman was certainly an experience and one which I would thoroughly recommend. You are literally scrubbed clean, all of you, including your hair! You come out feeling very fresh and envigorated although it is not something I would recommend if you have any sunburn! Do it at the beginning of your stay if this may be an issue. Things that let it down slightly are the shower room, which is tiny and did not have any towels in it (no one was there to askl for any so I had to dry myself on my robe. Not a big deal but would have been nice and perhaps they are usually there. It would also have been nicer to have a little more space to change in but again this is a Riad in the middle of the Medina so could perhaps be forgiven. I did feel that MK offer incredible value for money at \u20ac60 per person for a Hamman and massage and as such can thoroughly recommend the experience."

To top it all off the room where my husbands clothes were got locked and we were escorted to one of the rooms from the hotel which we thought was nice however know one came up to tell us the room had been unlocked. My husband had to come and get his clothes after 45 mins, we went to pay for our treatment and didnt complain remained calm they did apologise however you would think they would cut the cost of the treatment but no this didnt happen. They charged us full price and even expected a tip!!!!!! My husband had to ask for.his change back. All in all it spoilt our whole day not the best spa weve been to and wont be returning again im afraid. Oh and the snack of fruit we got in the middle of the treatment was a joke slices of apples so thin they could melt in your mouth lolbest of luck to them not our cup of tea really put a damper on our trip"

Spa MK have obviously gone to great lengths to emply experienced, qualified staff. Not only that but you couldn't meet more smiley, sweet people, who really genuinely want you enjoy the spa. Both the massage and Hammam are carried out in near darkness, which really added to the relaxation aspect - and I can't describe how wonderful the treatment room smells!!

We used it a lot and they were very flexible about when and where we could have our treatments. Without a doubt I would advise doing a hamam early on so that your skin is made ready for the sun. I'm not a facial person but my friend assures me it was luxurious. We had a lovely little henna done with our pedicure, an amazing rose oil bath, and one day after a lot of walking we had a special leg massage to relieve our tired legs and feet. We loved that so much that I think they will add this onto their menu!So many little touches that I couldn't mention everything but definitely recommend this place."

See Hassna, i promised i would write a review after my perfect hammam & massage !I stayed at maison MK (see review of the hotel under maison MK) & they have a brilliant spa there. Very luxurious set-up & such total attention to detail. I was given my hammam 'kit' - a beautiful bag with all the bits and pieces. Flip flops (colour coordinated with maison mk, obviously), the potions & soaps for the hammam all wrapped beautifully, the maison mk logo'd mitten thing, a big fluffy robe, and rose petals. Suitably perpared I entered the hot hammam where i was washed, scrubbed, soaped, washed, sugared, washed, lotioned, washed (did I mention washed...?) and left feeling like a new born baby.A 5 minute pause with fresh juice & fruit & then straight into the most relaxing massage it is possible to imagine. Candle light, dark room, Hassna with the most perfect touch ever. Life should always be like this."

Can't say I'd been bathed recently by another person.... should do that more often....especially if you're a bit of a control freak.. very kind, thoughtful, friendly and accomodating staff supported by upbeat, sensible oversight from management at the spa. The spa is immaculately clean and beautifully appointed and great value. We highly recommend travellers make a booking in advance and unwind early in your trip to Marrakech, it will help get you in the right frame of mind so that you can chill out on the terrraces and just slow things down.."

            "review": "pampering perfection. We first called the UK number for Maison MK and spoke with the owner about how we could use the spa at her hotel. We had several conversations in fact, which was really helpful as it helped us to get our bearings in Marrakech. And as a result we ended up visiting the spa twice! After the owner described her beautician as the waxing queen of the world and 'a giggling whirling dervish' I gave it a 'whirl' and can definitely attest to that!Two days later we returned to use the hamam (or is it a hammam?) - my friend had a hamam and I had a facial at the same time. The best facial I have had for a long time, and i am fussy! For the hamam I can definitely say that my friend was thoroughly scrubbed till she glowed like a baby. After a lovely refreshment of fruit and tea, we both left thoroughly cleansed and relaxed. Just a few steps outside the door of this lovely oasis, we entered into the hustle and bustle of the souks again for a very different experience!The only word of warning I would give is that you need to book in advance by email or by phone - i don't think you can just turn up. It is only a small spa, so you have to be clever about the treatments you have if there is more than one of you as there are just 2 treatment rooms. Although it is chic and beautiful and calming, and the girls are so gentle and friendly - we were so welcome and felt very special being there.Madeline"

Amazing massages and a fabulous hamam. I was left bright and alert from the hamam which was so luxurious, and was put to sleep by the candle lit massage ! And what a riad - Maison mk is drop dead gorgeous. Next time we are in Marrakech, and I hope its soon, this is more like the experience we want.

This secret little place, part of the beautiful maison mk riad / gastro mk restaurant has only recently opened its doors to external clients for the spa & i am so happy it has. I just rang on spec & they booked me in.It is, as my title says, a luxury boutique spa & my hubby & I visited for two of the hamam / massage combination treatments - what an experience. I started with the hamam and he started with the massage - and after the first 45 minutes, we both emerged. Me, scrubbed beautifully, honeyed, sugared, soaped, washed, and with the softest skin in the world. Him, half asleep & more relaxed than I have ever seen him before - he seemed to have lost the power of speech but mumbled that he had just received a 'glorious' massage.Then we swapped over & I certainly understood - it was a fabulous massage. Hasna, the masseuse, has a beautifful touch. From the moment she started, all was good in my world & she very cleverly tailored it to my needs as the massage progressed. The massage was in almost darkness - just a couple of candles & soothing music made it such a peaceful atmosphere.Great little touches like the fresh fruit salad at 'half-time', and fortunately I spied the Essie nail varnish on my way out so I treated myself to a quick 'emergency' manicure! Hope hubby didn't mind the extra wait - he certainly looked contented with the morning's activities.Can't wait to get back to Marrakech & to visit spa mk again."

What an absolute treat, we booked the Hammam and Massage treatment. After the initial greeting, we were guided to a changing room to robe up, then escorted to a hot room where we were bathed, soaped, showered, scrubbed. This was an experience like no other, truly authentic and the laugh we had was priceless. This alone would have been worth the price, we were then taken upstairs for our individual massages. A complete different setting and one of tranquillity and harmony. The best massage I have experienced to date, so not much more to add on that. After an active Hammam this is the perfect way to wind down and relax. Our only complaint was finding out about this place on our last day. Most definitely would have booked for all three days in Marrakech. Few tips would be to wear swimming trunks and avoid white boxer shorts\u2026. Located in the Kasbah neighbourhood but an absolute sanctuary for relaxation."

We asked specifically for more pressure, both before and during the massage, but the girls were giggling THE WHOLE MASSAGE and didn't vary the pressure at all. The worst was - and I have never had this from any massage therapist in my whole life and I love massages - when the lady removed my WHOLE TOWEL so my entire front was exposed, and started massaging there?!! The room was extremely freezing I felt I could get sick after. The therapist took about 3 lots of 5-10 minute breaks. Very unprofessional, talked to each other and giggled disturbingly throughout the whole 40 mins. Finished early, didnt say anything just led us back downstairs.

The 5 elements spa was difficult to find in the back street as not well signposted. Once inside the spa it was very tranquil - a riad courtyard setting with lots of side rooms. We changed into gowns and placed our clothes, keys etc into secure lockers. We were taken to the hammam room where we received our mud splashes. Very invigorating but remember to keep your eyes closed if you're wearing contact lenses.We were taken upstairs for the massage then bath. The stairs were difficult to negotiate with slippery feet in the plastic sandals they provided so be careful. Both the massage and bath were very good and relaxing. Great to experience as a couple - as we had done.The staff were attentive and gracious. At the end we were shown to a screened-off area off the courtyard near to the entranceway, where we could chill out in our gowns and warm towel wraps and contemplate. We had expected a herbal tea although we were given a bottle of water each. Then we were simply left. During this time there was a lot of activity outside the entrance some 10-15 metres away - men moving gas bottles, children drumming outside and mopeds screeching outside drifting fumes inside the doorway. It would help if they closed the door but it seems it is kept open so clients can find it.Basically we were not enamoured with the wind-down time and also had to find our own way out and reorientate ourselves to where the changing rooms are. They need to work on how these sessions are closed out as it left a negative impression although the main events were very good."

I went to this spa with 4 of my girlfriends and we all loved it.The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at ease and accommodate us.We were all given robes, towels, plastic slippers, paper panties and as much bottled water as we wanted.The Hot room was lovely with dim lighting and a lovely shower in the middle to wash before and between stages of the hammam treatment.The seats were extremely hot so you need to take an extra towel in with you to sit on.We all opted for the hour long massage after the heat and scrub which was very relaxing and the massage ladies were very good.After the treatment we lay on loungers and they brought us all mint tea, we stayed as long as we wanted and didn't feel at all rushed.All in all we had a very pleasant experience, I went back for a second one 2 days later !"

            "review": "Worst experience ever. As a special treat to myself on my last day in Marrakesh I decided to go to the spa for a hammam, massage and facial. the spa was recommended by the riad and guests that had been there for massages were happy so off I went. Unfortunatelly I decided to go for a massage untried by the others called thinness massage...I arrived and was given a locker containing a robe and plastic slippers, first impressions, the robe smelled of oils, so I wasn't sure it had been cleaned, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and was shown into a hammam only to be taken out again 10 seconds later to then wait and be shown into another hammam... Compared with a previous experience the whole thing was very quick, which is just as well as I was finding it too hot, and superficial, but ok. No towel given to dry yourself off, you are put back into the ( cloth) robe which you keep ( wet ) right until the end.I was then taken to the massage room and did not have the good sense to ask what the massage consisted of exactly ( I have had numerous different massages aimed at cellulite, drainage, circulation etc...so wasn't worried). Nothing was said either or asked.When I got in there was a used tissue on the massage bed which I found off putting to say the least, but again said nothing, the girl had a cold so probably forgot about it. she then started by on foot which was fine, and the calf which was firm but fine, unfortunately she then continued so hard up the first leg and the rest of the body it hurt like hell, and I have had 3 of my children with nothing at all and I would rather give birth than go through her massage again, it was excruciating, I told her it hurt, I flinched, I tried to move my limbs away because of the pain, I told her I had bad circulation and showed her a varicose vein in my arm, told her I had back and neck problems and to go easy, all to no avail, she kept saying it was normal (!!!). I did not get down and walk away thinking somehow I would feel wonderful once it stopped. But no, once over I was in a state of shock, my arms were shaking badly, and I was feeling like I had been mauled. I then was put back into the wet robe, taken to a day bed and given cold mint tea, and then taken to facial which was ok. i was so upset I decided to wait for the person who was coming for me outside in the street rather than sit there. I made it back to the riad, had a quick bite to eat and went straight to bed for the rest of the afternoon (4 hours) I felt so bad. Next morning I counted 12 bruises and still felt really bad in spite of taking a lot of arnica, pain killers and muscle relaxants. Two days later I still ache all over although the shaking has subsided. So all in all the treatments which were not the massage were just average, the hygiene and comfort just under average, the customer service inexistent as I told 4 different people I did not feel well and they just ignored me, and this particular massage only to be booked for your worst enemy !"

Unfortunately this wasn't the experience I was hoping for. The girl that took us to the Hamam was very young and giggled all the way through the session which wasn't very calming and also a little off putting as she giggled and scrubbed. She was quite fast and I didn't feel that the job was done particularly well compared to other hamams I have had.I was then taken for a massage and the girl that did my massage was very clearly in experienced. The massage was weak and I wasn't impressed. Having spoken to others I wish I had booked into Les Bains De Marrakech where their experience was much better and it is only up the road from the 5 Elements Spa. My recommendation would be to go somewhere else."

My partner and I were coming back from the souk after a long day of wandering around in the criminal heat of Marrakech at the end of July. We were desperate to reach our hotel' swimming pool, when a boy stopped us in the street and showed us a leaflet from a nearby spa, which was offering a discount on treatment packs. On the paper, the price seemed excellent and they did have availability there and then, so we decided to have a look at the place. The spa is located in a beautiful riad, decorated in a very elegant way. The personnel was extremely friendly and welcoming, and showed us to some cozy changing rooms where we were assigned a locker each (with key). In each locker we found: 1 bathrobe, 2 hand towels, a pair of slippers and a pair of flip flops. We were taken to the hammam room, an amazing space with arched ceiling and stone walls. Here my partner and I received all the treatments at the same time, assisted by two Moroccan girls who performed on us the traditional washing (hammam) with black soap, the famous Arabic overall scrub and a body & face clay mask. We were in heaven!!!! You may wonder whether it may be awkward receiving all these treatments at the same time as your partner, in the same room, and with 2 girls washing both him and me. Well, it wasn't awkward AT ALL. These women were spa professionals and knew their stuff very well. My boyfriend and I actually found it very cool to be treated simultaneously as it allowed us to see in each other's eyes what we were feeling at all times! After this complete session in the hammam room, we were left to relax for a while, then we were led to the massage room, where again we received a simultaneous relaxing massage. In this room there were 2 massage beds + a male and a female massage specialists. My boyfriend received a massage from the guy, I was massaged by the woman. The massage was about 45 min long and involved the use of Argan oil, typical of Morocco, which after the scrub leaves your skin as soft as a baby's. Finally, before leaving, we were accompanied to a relaxation area with individual beds and cushions: we laid down there while sipping some complimentary mint hot tea. When we came out we felt and looked like completely new people!! I have never felt as good in my life, even after some expensive beauty treatments. And the price was one of the most amazing parts: the whole pack, which overall lasted 2 hours or so, was the equivalent of 25 euros per person!!! Please go and find this hidden gem on your next trip to Marrakech. (PS. I wish I had taken pictures but we were so relaxed when we came out that we completely forgot!)"

It's hallways are expansive, rooms beautiful, hammam rooms are large with nice light. What threw me off was the staff (front desk hostesses) and the feeling that we were being rushed. They took us to dressing rooms, gave us robes and almost rolled their eyes when we asked for disposable underwear. After that it was mint tea time and introduction to their beautiful courtyard with inviting plunge pool. That part was rushed, maybe 5-10 minutes tops. Hammam (scrub time) was done poorly and superficially, with minimal use of products, and it did not include hair washing. Massage was wonderful tho, almost made up for the rest of the experience. Funny thing was, the entrance was grand and open and beautiful, but when it came to the exit time, they led us to the back door, that led to the back alley. I still giggle when i think about it. Kinda of a let down as the whole experience was."

We originally wanted a Hammam and massage but changed our minds to only Hammam due to limited time - thankfully we did. Hammam. I was taken to the changing rooms and then to the stream room by a lady who told me she'll perform Hamman on me. I wasn't given a choice. My preference would have been a male. She hardly spoke a word of English. It would have been nice if someone would have told me what was happening next and for how long, but that wasn't to be. For around 550 dhs it's not worth it as I could count the number of times she used the hamman scrub. That particular experience felt rushed. To top it off I was left in the steam room for what would seem like a long time I'd say around 30mins without her telling me when she'll return. If that wasn't bad (but I'm not sure whether this is normal practice) the steam room floor started to bubble with steam blasting from the vent. I was totally shaken up by it as the temperature got really high in barely high. Now, I'm not someone who can't handled heat but this was like I was trapped on top of a kettle while it was boiling over. I didn't make a fuss about the whole experience to management as I had kids and wife waiting for me and we had a prior engagement. Sorry to say I definitely will not be returning."

Decor at the Les Bains de Marrakech is definitely worth visiting the place if you are looking for luxury atmosphere, unfortunately, the treatments and hospitality is not 'top notch' comparing to other 5-star spas in Marrakech we have been to.1. Hospitality. Greetings and farewells at the reception are dry. They reminded me of tired employees at Tesco. However, a guy who was bringing the tea was lovely. He made our experience a bit more special.2. Treatments. Well... We arrived, changed and went straight to hammam. We were left there alone for a long period of time listening to staff giggles and gossips next room. Ladies did scrub us for 5 min and then told us to go to the shower at the same time (one shower! Two people!) well, that was it. We expected luxurious hammam experience with scrub and body washMud-wrap: a walnut size ball of mud was spread all over my body. I could barely see it on my body let alone on my husband who is 6 ft tall.we're Covered in foil and blanket, and left for 40 minutes. We felt ourself like 'foiled' fish left in the oven. We uncovered ourselves in 15-20 minutes and waited to be collected.Massage: My husband felt relaxed after and was quite pleased. As for me, massage was ok. Unfortunately, masseuse kept burping, so it kinda kept me awake 3. Hospitality and staff. I believe hospitality and staff make whole experience either pleasant or not. First of all, clients visit spa to relax. We could barely relax due to staff talking. In acclaimed 5 star spas that would be unacceptable. Well, it did improve after we complained to a guy, who was probably a manager. He was nice. Secondly, clients expect being looked after. During hammam and mud wrap there was no one around. In general, my impression is that this place has become a 'spa factory'- lots of clients, there is no need to work hard on every client or train your staff accordingly."

The atmosphere was not only relaxing but outstandingly beautiful, and the service was excellent & attentive. I would recommend budgeting for an additional hour or two after your service to relax over tea and cookies, or to lay outside by the pool.

I feel better after a visit to the steam room at my local gym. The decor and smells are wonderful. The staff are lovely, but at the end of the day I wanted a Turkish bath style hammam to make me feel cleansed and refreshed. I felt worse on the way out than on the way in. On departure the receptionist asks if I enjoyed it... I said not really as there was no steam. She never bothered. She told the owner/manager (as did we), he too was not bothered.

If I were going to book again I would go for something slightly more expensive. We were shown to the pool where we waited to go through and had some mint tea. We hadn't asked fora private room but ended up having one just for the 2 of us, we were shown to the shower and then to a sauna like room. The lady covered us in eucalyptus gel type stuff and left us for a little while, washed it off and then scrubbed us with black soap. We were then shown to another room where we could just lie down and relax until we wanted to leave. The lady didn't speak much english but it wasn't a problem- she was also not too hard with the scrubbing as i've heard a few horror stories, she asked us if it was okay. We were given the mits to take home with us which was a nice touch, and the mint tea was the nicest I had all holiday. I would have liked to have visited a public Hammam but my friend was slightly apprehensive, if you are looking for a luxury hammam this is lovely but I would definitely recommend paying slightly more rather than having the standard hammam. It was also VERY peaceful and we felt very tired and relaxed afterwards so it's a nice thing to do in the evenings- they said 5pm was their busiest time."

I could not have been more pleased with our visit here. From the moment we stepped foot in the door, it was an oasis from the chaos of the medina. The facilities were stunning and service top notch. 3 of us girls had a hamman together and then individual massages with a break for tea and a snack in between. My masseuse was incredible. I regularly get massages in the USA and she was one of the best I've ever had for sure. Definitely will return on the next visit and hopefully get a two hour massage this time... Thank you! :-)"

Yes it's clean and well designed, but it should be at the price you have to pay (600 dirhams for a traditional hammam and massage).The staff were curt and we really didn't feel welcomed. It was nice to have the private hammam - but there was only one person to scrub the both of us down and it was a fast once over. We then had some mud quickly applied and that was it.The rest area was nice and the mint tea was ok. Finally the massage - pretty bad. We both had the 'drainage' which felt like an hour of stroking - hardly a massage. I asked for more pressure, which lasted a few minutes and then it went back to stroking. Pretty useless.We then went back to the changing room and you're then escorted out the back door via the payment area. I would have complained, but the woman was more interested in collecting the cash.It's nicely designed and it's clean, but you do feel like you are on a conveyor belt. It's touristy and a bit predictable.Wouldn't go back."

The friendly receptionist gave us a list of services in French but we read English only. We waited for a few minutes for someone to bring us the English list of services. We decided on the traditional hammam and massage for $60.00 That included forty-five minutes body scrub and one hour of massage. Upon request, we put down a deposit and returned later for the services. (It is best to have an advance appointment.)When we returned, we sat in the waiting area until we were called. Shortly thereafter, a woman opened a door and invited us in. She presented to each one of us a heavy white robe and slippers. She lead us to the changing area. After we changed, we were lead to a room to relax before we get the scrub. Two women lead us into the scrubbing room that we both shared. We were instructed to take a cool shower before laying down on a bed. After they left the room, the hot steam came on. The same two women returned after the stream treatment and poured cool water over us. Mud was put on us and they left again. Shortly, they came back to the room and scrubbed us. The scrub was quick and somewhat harsh. It would be nice if they were a little more gentle with the scrub. Afterward, we were told to shower and relax in another room. Mint tea and water were offered to us. Two different women came and took us to different room for a massage. My massage therapist used the right pressure to massage. I felt like I was in paradise and could not get enough of it. I felt disappointed when the time was up. Afterward, we were directed to return to the room to relax again. Water, mint tea, and biscuits were served to us before we got dressed and to leave.This was my first hammam and my third massage in my life. I can not to compare the hammam experience, but the massage was the best I have ever had."

The scrub was done in a steam room and then we loved to relaxing beds for some tea and to cool down. Following that we had a gorgeous rose petal bath, very relaxing and fragrant although probably was a bit too long in terms of heat!A real treat and a must do.

Unfortunately beauty isn't everything and I've had much better hammam at incredibly less fancy spas. The staff were just friendly enough, but not as warm and welcoming as most Moroccans. I was rushed into the steam room, lathered up as my attendant said \"face up\" and \"turn over\" and then rushed out. I was left for 20 minutes to steam. The steam was nice. She came in once and asked me over and over \"okay?\" \"okay\"? She couldn't understand English or Spanish so I was completely unable to communicate with her. My bad for not speaking French, I know. When she returned she quickly exfoliated me and then rushed me over to the shower where I washed my own body and hair. I was rushed to the \"relaxation\" area and given nice tea and biscuits. My relaxation time was not rushed thankfully. Then I was herded out the backdoor to pay and be on my merry way. I know this place has rave reviews and it is certainly a beautiful spot, but for me it was completely impersonal and rushed and therefore not very relaxing. Perhaps they've gotten too big for their own good and forgotten that it's not just about packing the daily schedule to hit their financial quota but about offering a warm, welcoming and relaxing environment for spa goers."

Half had good bath experiences, half had decent massage, but not one had a good all-around experience. My massage was terrible -- no pressure, no change after I asked for more pressure a couple times, and way too much oil. The locker room is small and easily overrun with ~ 10 people in it. Compared with other experiences in Istanbul etc, where the two hours are filled with bath, scrub, shampoo, massage, this experience was a lot of sitting around. Probably could have cut the time in half. We had (a likely unique) bad experience at the end too. We asked the reception to ring two taxis for us but she wouldn't unless we gave her a number. We didn't have one as our riad, restaurants, etc had been doing it for us all week. So we had to wait at the entrance to the kasbah during rush hour trying to flag down two taxis which took about 45 minutes. At 60\u20ac pp it was reasonable but we would definitely try another place next time."

Overall, the experience was amazing and at no point did I feel anything other than relaxed. Staff were always there to apply treatments, to direct, to assist, to bring complimentary tea and water.The place itself is beautiful, with wonderful Moroccan design, and I felt like wandering around with a camera (but was too chilled!)The hammamm was not too hot...They did add more steam at one stage, although I would have preferred it a little hotter. The soap and scrubs really exfoliated well, and they give you the glove to take away (which is reassuring too).The massage was genuinely relaxing, and very competently done.Since we went as a couple, both the hammamm and the massage were in private rooms for two people.There were also relaxation areas and a pool (albeit extremely cold!).If you are looking for a hammamm, massage, spa experience in Marrakech, then I would definitely suggest here.

The staff could tell that my friend and I really wanted to stay at Les Bains De Marrakech and not go to the alternative so worked it out that they would sort out the mess with the tour operators and we could stay at the spa.Having arrived at 11am, the spa didnt have space till 1pm but after reception spoke to the spa manager and staff, the staff were willing to take their lunches a little later so that we could start our spa at 12pm!We first went to the hammam where we were oiled up and left to steam for 10-15min. The lady then came back in and scrubbed us (really hard!) then put on a clay mask and again, left to steam. After the hammam, we then went to a resting area and had some tea. We then moved onto our massage and this was amazing! The staff did whisper to each other throughout but we didnt mind this as they were still giving us a really good massage! After this, we then went to another resting area before it was time to go!All in all, a fantastic experience and Id like to thank the receptionist who was on duty on the 8th Oct at 11am.

I came here with a friend in August and we had booked the Marrakesh Ritual which was 45' of Hammam, 30' Mud Wrap plus a 1 hour massage. according to the website you could choose between relax and drainage. we booked on their website in advance and also paid in advance to guarantee the booking.after arrival and changing we were brought to the outside pool area to wait for our treatments. the pool was nice and the whole area quite clean and open.the hammam was great and the people were friendly (don't be shy).after that we were wrapped in our bathrobe and brought to a room with lounge chairs for the two of us to relax. we got a bottle of water as well as a glass of tea.after a while we were picked up and brought upstairs for our mud wrap.it wasn't a mud wrap as i expected. there was barely any mud and it was dabed very sparingly on to your body and then we were wrapped in foil with a towel over our eyes and lights almost completely off. it was very relaxing but we might as well have been wrapped in just the foil based on the amount of mud.after that we were once again in the poolarea and then brought to our massage.we were not asked about relax or drainage and i wasn't sure if they were just starting off slowly and then would be asking which I wanted.it never happend.the massage was extremely slow and it just consisted of rubbing our skin or just randomly resting and touching. there was no real technic and there was no hint of a professional masseus trying to release tension or work our muscles.there was an extreme amount of oil and the hair and face was also massaged! i was not happy about this as it doesn't say anything about a facial and the amount of oil only came out after washing my hair about 3 times.It was not relaxing at all and I just wanted it to end as it was absolutely useless. it was the kind of massage anybody can give a friend without any knowledge of how to massage.we felt that they were waiting for us to fall asleep so they didn't have to do much. both were yawning and resting their hands on us for several minutes.i would definitely not recommend the massages. one of the worst i've ever had.we complained afterwards and the receptionist told us I would be getting an e-mail, but I still haven't gotten anything after 3 weeks.other than massage i would recommend this place as it inexpensive and clean and the staff is friendly."

Overall, the experience was really wonderful, although I had a few points for improvement:- I found the massage staff rude, during the massage, and when I had to undress, they were giggling, and then proceeded to cough and yawn over me several times during the massage (ew!)- the massage was very light, and although nice, I would expect a bit more- there was no communications during the whole things about what was going on, and as a customer, it is nice to know exactly what is going on!Overall though, the experience was lovely, the place was clean, and for a three hour experience, the price was very decent"

The place is really nice and relaxing with a pool to sit around before your treatment. The Hammam and massage were excellent and we felt really relaxed after it. The only criticism i have of this place were the staff. The 2 ladies that did our treatment were fine. But the people who show you around seemed completely disinterested in us. They forgot about us after our treatment and we had to go and find someone to show us where to go next. We heard them all standing around chatting for about 20 minutes when we were meant to be relaxing after the treatment."

Despite arriving an hour early (it was very hot outside!) we were allowed to come in and use the pool while waiting for our treatments. Yes the desk staff (as per other reviews) were a little surly, but on the whole we found the staff pleasant and all the treatments we had (hammam, oriental bath, massage) were professionally executed. The massage, as others have observed, could have been firmer, but it was thoroughly relaxing. I can imagine that if you don't speak French that things could be a little confusing here, but one poster's comment about not being allowed a shower before leaving is simply absurd: there are plenty of showers in the changing rooms. While not at the level of elite spas (I say this in comparison to a number I've visited around the world), Les Bains de Marrakech is a beautiful place and a real respite from the busy city outside."

Our hotel recommended and booked at the Les Bains de Marrakesh for us. Before our visit I was a little apprehensive as there are many places around that provide a Hamam and some of them looked really awful from the outside. However we were very pleasantly surprised. This spa is just inside one of the entrances to the medina and as you walk through the door you already feel cool and relaxed. The reception staff are very polite and efficient and let you know exactly what's going to happen. We had booked the 'Traditional' package, which includes a 45 min Hamam and an hours very relaxing massage. This costs 600 dh (approx \u00a345). In between each stage you can relax by the pool, or in one of their many relaxation rooms. They then come and take you to the next part your treatment. I was a bit worried about doing this on my own, as I'd never had a Hamam, massage or even been to a spa! But they have couples rooms where you can have the Hamam, massage or such together if you wish. The do provide a robe and slippers to walk around in but women just need bikini bottoms for the treatments and men swim trunks/boxers or swim shorts. Also, as a nice extra, they keep you topped up with water, mint tea and local biscuits. All in all the price is mid range for top of range facilities. Throughly recommended."

Between our hammam and our massage we were served mint tea whilst we relaxed on loungers indoors. The massage lasted an hour but it felt like 2! It was out of this world and I kept nodding off. Afterwards we were given a chance to wake up with some more mint tea in the indoor courtyard. The interior design of this spa is beautiful. Will definitely be back!"

We booked the appointment at midday. They asked us to get there by 11:30 so we did.We got there and they gave us our locker number and directed us to the changing rooms. They alsoGave us a bath robe and slippers and told us to chill around the pool until the time of the Hammam. We waited around the pool til what I think was midday sipping maroccan tea offered to us by a nice lady and then we were directed to the Hammam room. Unfortunately they don't offer paper underwear so women can either lie naked or wear their own knickers (or bikini bottoms) and men have to wear boxers or their own swim wear. No one told us to bring a spare pair so we only hoped that they would get dry by the time we left. The Hammam lasted 45 minutes and the Ladies were very nice and smiley. After the Hammam they asked us to take a shower and then we were directed to the relax room were we were offered tea and a bottle of water. We waited thereFor around 10 minutes and then we were brought to the massage room were they massaged the whole body for an hour. Tbh it wasn't the best massage of my life (I do massages at work so I was concentrating on her movements and the pressure) but my Boyfriend loved and fell asleep so I guess it was great. After the Massage we were directed again to the relax room were we were offered 2 biscuits each and tea again. The whole experience was amazing and for 600dhs (around \u00a339) we couldn't ask for more. I recommend this place to everyone as the interiors are amazing and you feel like you are in an Alladin's movie."

All of the staff were extremely friendly and spoke very good English. The decor and ambience is fantastic and I couldn't fault it. I would highly recommend the hammam (sitting in a sauna where you are basically exfoliated and cleansed until your skin is as soft as a baby!) but my sister and I both felt that the massage was not worth \u00a330 more. The massage was very relaxing but was not the type we are used to. It felt more like you were being stroked with pressure rather than being kneaded into (if that makes sense!) but perhaps that's what a Moroccan massage is like. It was lovely to have mint tea and bottled water offered whilst we were waiting between the hammam and massage and after the massage. One thing we both noticed was that we frequently felt as though we were left to relax/wait around without being told what for or how long. I would definitely come back here again but only for the hammam, not the massage. TIP: do not wear new/expensive swimwear for the hammam as is might darken it (learning from experience!)"

So many staff in there!! Changing facilities were great and the place smelled gorge. The only reason we have not given it a 5* is because we had booked the Marrakech experience (hamman, mud wrap and massage) the hamman was fine , it was 2 of us in there and we were left in the steam room for quite some time before and during the treatments, obviously your pours need to open so this is part of it, but it seemed forever and we thought they had forgotten about us as this was not explained. Then once taken up for the mud wrap we were slightly disappointed with experience as there were 2 girls and they had a small pot each of which they were smearing small parts of 'mud' over us to then wrap us up. What the girls did took 2 minutes and then they left us a long time to snooze etc and relax but not really worth the money that you pay when we could have done this to each other. Wasn't the kind of thick mud we were expecting.Massage was fab and we would do the whole experience again, recommend it if you're after a little tranquil get away but wouldn't say that you HAVE to do it or you will be missing out if you don't go. Of corse there are other treatments so this is just a review on what we paid \u20ac128 for 2 people. We were in there for 3.5 hours in total and would say the hands on therapies lasted around 1.5 hours including the hour massage .All in all it's a beautiful place"

I have been in this spa few years ago and of course came back as soon as I visited Marrakech two weeks ago.I was trying to book my massage via email and I was getting response quickly.Visit itself was wonderful experience ,had 1 hour relaxing massage and it was perfect.At the end they take you to beautiful room where you will be given mint tea and biscuit.However you cannot be there forever as they are very busy and people from next time slot are due to enter.Anyway,if you are fan of spa,this is the place you must visit while in Marrakech,however remember they are very busy and you need to book in advance to avoid disappointment .Will be back in Les Bains de Marrakech for sure."

            "review": "Know what you're getting yourself into. I write this as an English female who has had a few British spa experiences but none in Morocco, but I feel that I would have wanted to know this info!We went for the traditional hamman experience followed by massages - I had a relaxing one and my husband had a \"draining\" one. Overall, this was a good experience and we felt that we had a relaxing time and that it was friendly, clean and good value for money, however, as a primarily tourist venue, we felt that they were a little liberal with the nudity!We were taken to our hamman first where my bikini top was taken off me. Then you go through the traditional hamman experience. They will touch your breasts and you won't really be able to hide anything!Then for the massage, they gave us some paper underwear (I think you would be spared this if you'd put a spare pair of your own in the pocket of your robe). My husband got some perfectly reasonable shorts, I got a skimpy paper thong...During the massage, they will pull down your pants to massage your bottom and again will massage your breasts. The massage rooms all come off a long corridor. Each room has a door (made of wood) and two windows with wooden shutters. We only realised halfway through the massage when we opened our eyes to turn over that whilst these had been closed to start with, they were all now wide open, onto the public corridor. Literally anyone, of either sex could have walked down the corridor, whilst we were lying there naked, but for a flimsy bit of paper!In addition, whilst the massage was nice, my husband felt his wasn't really \"draining\" and my massage therapist kept yawning and checking her phone during my massage. As I said at the beginning, this was an overall good experience and if you are used to getting naked and are very body confident then none of this will bother you and you'll have a good time. Equally, forewarned is forearmed and if you now know that you'll have to get really naked, maybe that will help you relax more too. I just got the feeling that they had the wrong idea about tourists and just because we feel ok about showing our legs and shoulders and being naked in front of our partners, it doesn't mean that we get naked in front of the world!"

Ww had the Hammam for 45 minutes where you'd lie in this charming hot room and the ladies come in and pour warm water over you then put the steam on then they come back & scrub you down with mittens which you are given later as gifts. Then rub this sandy dark coloured cream all over you then you have more steam & at the end you have a shower using orange scented shower gel, you then rest before your massage which was one the best I have ever had, she managed to get rid of years of work related stress knots in my neck shoulders :) the facial & head massage was so gentle and my whole body felt relaxed & tingled at the end.The rooms are lush & clean the towels are luxurious and the scented rooms make the whole experience unforgeable. For \u00a339 per person for 3 hours of perfect bliss I want to come back again and again."

Me and my partner had treatments in couple: the hammam was nice also if is not so easy resist 45 minutes inside, we had an hard scrub (maybe a little bit more delicate and longer is better) and a nice rest after it. A refreshing mint tea was served, before we continued with the rose petals bath. No one will disturb you and you can close your eyes in the room decorated with candles. This was my favourite part. After another brief rest there was the massage. A little too soft according to my opinion, but not bad. I recommend to enjoy this place much more for the atmosphere that for the treatments."

By comparison, near-identical scrubs in Turkish hammams lasted for a good 5-10 minutes. The real disappointment, however, was the \"massage\". I felt like I was dipped in a vat of Argan oil and lightly patted for 60 minutes. Was it relaxing? Yes. Did my back feel better for it? No. For what it's worth, my friend reported a similar experience. [And she repeatedly asked for more pressure!]I don't know that I'd recommend Les Bains de Marrakech to other travellers, but it didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth. Just oil in my hair.

The hammam is such an important part of any trip to this part of the world but we were not quite confident enough to do exactly as the locals did and visit one of the more simple establishments. Retrospectively I think that was a mistake. The setting (just before the slave gate in the Kasbah) was easy to find and the interior darkly mystical with its chocolate drapes and intricate lanterns. The session started with us lying on covered slabs in a cave like room, which was filed with heady eucalyptus scented steam. When our pores were sufficiently open two women came in and proceeded to cover us in soap (special black soap that looks like treacle). It was very quick and casual and then we were left to steam again. A second visit allowed them to scrub the soap (and layer or two of dirt) off us. After this whirlwind affair we were left to steam again before being taken to sit and allow our heads to cool down. I was in Jordan a couple of years ago and the process was much less perfunctory and rather more comprehensive. I appreciate that we may be viewed as wealthy foreigners but I can help feeling that a hammam frequented by locals would have given appreciates better service for a fraction of the price - certainly a lesson to be learned about overcoming my squeamish ness of other people's dirt."

We left at 6:30 am, the coach was quite cold as the air con was on, but that I'm sure you could ask the driver to turn off. After a couple of hours we stopped at a fuel station, there you can eat, drink and use the loo. The prices are ok, no dearer than uk and the facilities are clean.There is a lot of walking when you get to Marrakech so wear comfy shoes and they also suggest that ladies have their shoulders and knees covered. You go to the Mosque, outside are public toilets, if you need to use them be prepared....the smell is awful, you hover over a hole in the floor, there are plastic footprints either side so you can perfect your aim! Lol. Take tissue with you, they charge for toilet roll. You visit the Souk, it's amazing but keep you wits about you, scooters drive at you, it's up to you to move! We were taken to Dar Essalam for lunch, this was very nice. You are given free time at the Souk for shopping then early evening meal before departing back to Agadir. There is so much to see, including Snake Charmers..it is a long day but well worth it."

            "review": "Seduced by decor - room for improvement. I chose to have an indulgent afternoon at Les Bains after glowing reviews in several well regarded luxury travel magazines. The interior is absolutely exquisite and luxurious. I had the \"traditional face & body\" package which consisted of hamman + scrub, 1 hr draining massage & 1 hr purifying facial. The steam room was small but lovely and intimate and the therapist was great. The massage was not bad (therapist had good technique but it felt like a skin polish even after having asked for firmer pressure). The facial consisted of about 10 different types of masks and scrubs (no steam or extraction). My skin felt great afterwards but it would've been nice to be told what was being done and what products were being used.Overall, for the amount they charged which is somewhere north of average but certainly not expensive, the experience was okay. The staff could do with some more training in service delivery (i could hear therapists chatting in a nearby staff area throughout my first treatment which was a mood killer). I was also left alone for about 15-20 minutes between treatments, not knowing what was going on and whether someone would come back to fetch me. After the treatments, i was pointed to the stairs and bid farewell with simply \"bye bye\" - the place was dark and massive, with a labyrinth of corridors. Massage therapists should also be taught as a rule of thumb to ask clients re pressure and general comfort level - they tend to forget when you are lying naked on a bed covered in oil with the aircon running, it can get rather cold (i had to ask for extra towels).Recommendation - it would've been nice to have a few more amenities in the bathroom for post treatment i.e. face/body moisturiser (what better way than to promote and flog their own products) and comb/brush for doing your hair. Tip - if travelling during summer months, take your bathers as there is a nice pool to lounge by."

We were fortunate enough to visit Hammam de la Rose two days before and it was truly excellent. For the same price, you will get a much better Hammam experience in a nice, modern setting with friendly and knowledgeable staff. The massage there was also very good and very firm (as requested). Les Bains by comparison was shockingly bad. The Hammam took place in a room that was not particularly atmospheric or comforting. And the massage was by far the worst massage that my wife and I have ever had. It was so bad that we actually laughed during our couples massage as it felt more like a moisturising session than a deep tissue massage. The masseuses chatted to each other during our massage which didn't help the mood. They also spent a good portion of the massage stroking our hair and patting our feet, whilst digging their uncut nails into our skin when attempting to massage our backs. My wife and I regularly have massages in London and whenever we go abroad, but this one was so bad that it has prompted me to write my first ever TripAdvisor review. Avoid at all costs, and put your money to work at Hammam de la Rose!"

The ladies in the Hammam part were a little abrupt and no explanation of what was going to happen. Still enjoyable. Plenty of rest periods between stations. Lots of mint tea and cold bottled water. We both found the massages to be 'nice' but not anywhere near what we were hoping for/expecting. More of a light rub with some oil. If you are hoping for an invigorating, deep tissue massage then maybe try elsewhere. Enjoyable day overall."

The receptionist is the first person you meet when you come into Le Bains de Marrakech and I felt she could have been a bit friendlier and more welcoming. Giving your clients a smile would be nice too. Also while we were relaxing in between treatments (scrub/steam) we could hear some of the attendants laughing and making a lot of noise outside in the corridor which spoilt the relaxing ambience. The massage was fantastic and I drifted off to sleep and felt very calm and relaxed at the end. On the whole it is a good place to go to escape the hustle and bustle of Marrakech for a few hours. The d\u00e9cor is amazing and most of the staff were very attentive but there are a couple that definitely need more training in customer care."

The staff are friendly and attentive, the surroundings luxurious. The exterior pool is an added bonus and wonderful place to relax or swim for a while, ahead of your treatments.Compared to the UK or Europe, the cost of treatments in such luxurious surroundings are amazing value. The regular supplies of bottled water as well as mint tea and cakes are always very welcome.My only complaint is that the relaxation areas directly after the hammam itself are often a little noisy, and this can take away from the relaxing atmosphere and general experience. This is occasionally due to the staff chatting, but is mainly caused by the other clients who are excited after their treatment! Maybe a few polite signs asking you to be conscious of others when talking, may do the trick?All in all, this a wonderful hammam, which I highly recommend. I only wish that I could treat myself every week, rather than every month. If you are coming to Marrakech, do make time to visit les Bains and pamper yourself!"

The staff are direct... They say \"shower now\"... \"Turn over now\"... Etc but are very professional and very good. The decor is amazing, the experience is fantastic, the massages magical, the atmosphere wonderful. If you like fake Irish bars... Don't go. If you want to experience different cultures, see traditions, feel what locals feel, then this is something you should not miss. No one should have given this less then four stars. We had a traditional hammam and 1hr argan oil massage for \u00a342gbp. We were told by an Irish couple that they had a orange blossom bath which apparently was amazing."

To start with you enter that lovely building & are greeted not only by the lovely staff but all your senses too...your eyes are delighted with a beautiful d\u00e9cor, then the lovely smells of incenses then your skin is welcomed by a fantastic pool where you sun bath, relax & swim. All gorgeous. After a good 30-40 min in the amazing pool you go to start the treatments. We were 4 girls & we had the treatments in pairs, which was very convenient so we could enjoy together.We started with the sauna, mask & salt scrub, which made us feel like in a princess steamed room with a marvellous marble d\u00e9cor. Then moved into a relaxing room for a good 15-20 minutes followed by a mint tea. After that went for the 1 hour massage full body which was amazing again...so relaxing. Then you move again into a relaxing room to then finalise with s rose petals covered bath which with all the incenses were just from another world.The staff will not rush you at all...its your day to relax & enjoy it.The only problem I had was to cope with the heat. I passed out after the bath but merely because I struggle to cope with the heat & all activities included heat at some sense.The city was very hot alone, the the sauna & the bath was just too much for me, but its a personal problem of low blood pressure so no fault for the Spa.When I passed out the staff were superb & super helpful. I had a doctor from the spa with me plus the Spa general manager to help me recover. They were just so helpful & attentive. A must go place!!!Just make sure you eat well (but not too much) before your full day of Spa.Loved it!!! We all 4 did!!!"

We were basically shuffled into a room lying there without knowing what was going to happen next. After a few minutes a lady came in and I must admit that she was the only person on the premises that at least made an effort to make us feel comfortable. Yet once again no explanation ! The massage was very average and I could tell that the girl who had attained had obviously very little experience. No towels provided for showering and at least a plastic bag could have been offered for the wet swimwear. Of course I understand that its is Ramadan and its probably difficult for the girls to work in such conditions. Makes me wonder whats really going on behind the scenes !

Once this treatment was finished we were led to a relaxing area where we were given mint tea and bottled water. This would have been lovely but the staff were standing close by talking in very loud voices...not very relaxing ! Our next treatment was the relaxing massage, the room we were taken into was very cold, and it took a while for the ladies to sort themselves out to start the treatment. I must admit the massage was lovely but spoilt buy the constant yawning that we both could hear. Once the massage was finished were were shown to another relaxing room, given tea and left on our own. After 30 minutes no one came in so we changed and left. In summary the decor is beautiful but the staff really let us down on this visit. We will defiantly return to Marrakech but not use this spa again and sadly would not recommend it."

Never hurry on to the next station. 3 hours of treatments (the works) and resting between and after. The massage was adequate. Not \"trained/educated/certified\" like they are in the US but not bad. Other than that we loved it.I am from the San Francisco Bay Area, where the same sort of thing would have been $350+ and would not have had the gommage available, which I loved (they give you your glove to take with you, nice since I forgot to buy one and ensures no multi-use).I have no idea what others had to complain about. Another reviewer mentioned the staff hardly spoke. I find a chatty staff a distraction when I am trying to relax. They guided by touch. Also this is a Muslim country and these women are working with nearly naked men that are not their husbands, which must be quite a challenge.Definitely worth the price and the time."

Finally they came back to perform a 1 minute scrubbing, followed by very hastily applying on us what I might guess was the algae wrap. We ended up massaging the wrap on ourselves and on each other, as it felt like the ladies didn't really do a thorough job and they had again left us to wait.Overall the service received was far from our expectations: the hammam ladies seemed to be very dispassionate about their job and uninterested in their customers. Of the 45 minutes that the hammam experience was supposed to take, we spent 40 minutes waiting for something to happen. The worst rip off in Marrakech in my opinion, to be avoided."

            "review": "mixture of good and bad. This place is somewhat over-rated in my view. Four of us visited the spa. We all went for the traditional hammam-massage combo. There were two types of massage on offer - relaxing and circulation. Despite asking a number of times, the staff were unable to describe the difference between the two. Myself and my wife found the hammam element disappointing. There was one robust lady who oversaw the hammam for the two of us. She was in the room for no more than 5 minutes out of the 40 we spent in the treatment room, though this is fairly normal apparently. She mainly seemed to be in a rush to go outside the room, where she was having an animated chat with a colleague, which took away from the relaxing atmosphere in the room for us. Despite this, she fished quite aggressively for a tip at the end but I was not prepared to tip that type of service.Things improved quite a bit for us in terms of the relaxing message, which was just as described. We were very happy with our massages. That said, one of our friends in the other group was unhappy with the massage, having been left alone in the treatment room for almost 20 mins, which is slack when you pay for a one hour massage.The rooms and facilities here are very attractive but the service seems to be quite variable, which appears to be mainly down to the staff. I wouldn't discount this place but it may also be worth considering alternative options."

We opted for the basic hammam package as we were on a low budget trip but would definitely go back and try some the other treatments. We had not booked before arriving in marrakech but called up from our hotel and got a booking for 6pm that day.Right from the moment you walk off the street you are greeted with the overwhelming feeling of luxury as you walk through the beautiful entrance, and are shown to the equally nice changing rooms. We (my sister and I) were treated in a room with just the two of us by a lovely lady (maybe named Carolin?). Although she did not speak much English and us not much French we were able to communicate ok and it all added to the experience (we found it quite funny). We were washed, lathered and scrubbed before being shown to a private relaxation room where we were offered mint tea and traditional cakes. And we're even given the exfoliation glove used to take home (with the name of hammam on it)It was a great experience and we both thoroughly enjoyed it, even with the communication barriers. All we would recommend is to go before you get sunburnt!!"

In spite of organizing a huge (and time consuming) party, I decided to do something different for my 40th birthday and headed to Marrakech... I went with a girlfriend of mine to \"Les Bains\" for wonderful moments of indulgence. I highly recommend this place which is known to be the best in the city. It is known to have hosted numerous French movie stars and artists. The ballet of hostesses guides you through this maze of beautiful corridors and veils hung to the ceiling. Your privacy is respected at all times and you never encounter any other clients except in the relaxing area... You are served chilled water, peppermint tea & patisseries throughout your stay. The General Manager, who personally greets you at the entrance, seems to be on duty 24/7, has an eye to the details and directs his staff to ensure your comfort. Treatments are perfectly executed and, despite the surrounding decor, end up to be much cheaper than in Europe. You definitely feel like royalty and you will keep wonderful recollections of this place for ever. Two last tips : make sure you book well in advance and if you wish to stay in a beautiful & comfortable riad literally next door, I recommend you stay at \"Riad Awa\", it's 4* and 20 meters away !"

At one point I'm pretty sure it was the owner himself who greeted us in English and gestured us to follow one of the girls towards the massage rooms upstairs.The bath was great, we were in a small stoned, cave-like steam room together but being someone not accustomed to steam rooms, I would recommend not eating very much beforehand otherwise you might feel sick like we did having just eaten breakfast. I thought the scrubbing was tolerable and the attendant asked if it was ok.I knew to expect being led from step-to-step and room-to-room and being left for awhile, and I thought it just added to the relaxed experience.The relaxing massages were exactly that, with sweeping and smoothing type movements. They were very thorough, and I almost fell asleep, so I'd consider that a successful relaxing massage."

We arrived half an hour before and were led to our changing rooms which are large, clean and like those you would expect in a spa. There are lots of towels and showers with their shower gel in so you can wash down afterwards too. You are given a wristband to open your locker, I felt comfortable that my possessions were secure. Then we were left to sunbathe on sunloungers in a central courtyard around a little swimming pool which was bliss. The hammam itself is quite an experience, we had two women scrub us down, cover us in plant goo (which was a lot nicer than it sounds) and sluice us down with water. I have never been so clean or soft-skinned! Then we were allowed to relax on loungers (inside) with mint tea and water for a while, which was a nice touch. Then we had a massage in the same room which was wonderful. Not a hardcore sports massage, but incredibly relaxing. I thought the whole place was beautifully and luxuriously decorated and well laid-out - there are clearly a lot of people there at any one time but we never felt as if we had been forgotten or part of a conveyor belt.

However, this was a close second and the whole experience was probably the most self-indulgent thing I have ever done. My wife and I were looked after together throughout our \"traditionelle\" package. We started with a rub down and then mud wrap in a lovely steam room, then washed off and into luxuriant robes for a lie down in a large quiet room with a mint tea. Then upstairs for a double massage. I have only ever come out of a massage feeling sore and bruised before. This was amazing - the masseuse seemed to have about eight hands and I finished up by falling asleep! Then back down to the closed \"courtyard\" of the house for more mint tea in opulent surroundings. We came out after 2 hours feeling wonderfully refreshed and all for approximately \u00a345 per head."

The hammam was pretty bad. You get scrubbed, they leave, you get rinsed and moisturised and they leave and each time (3 in total) the room gets hotter. By the last time we were begging for relief. After the hammam they sent us into a nice relaxation room where we got tea before heading into our hot stone massages. We were really happy with this one. Then we had a couples relaxation massage (even though we told them when we booked that we didn't want to be in the same room). My masseuse was yawning the entire time, every once in awhile the two masseuses were talking to each other kind of loudly and giggling. The massages were completely ok, but nothing special. The only one we were crazy about was the hot stone. I would definitely go back to Maison MK and get the hammam/massage package and pay 1400 dihram instead of paying less with one more treatment here.

Having read through the previous negative reviews I can't help but wonder where all this people have been, because surely wasn't the same establishment.Since you arrive, you receive an exquisite and warm welcome. The hamman, although is not the most rustic or traditional one, is superbly performed. The relaxing intervals are filled with a very chilling atmosphere, drinks and even local cakes. I found the staff very helpful and even though most of the masseur don't speak English ( If I want an English speaker one, I'll stay at home) are very professional and lively always trying to make you feel comfortable. In overall an amazing experience. I might even repeat before I leave."

I like the old style hammans. This certainly isnt that.They don't explain what will happen and you are left alone in rooms not knowing what is going on - they need to talk through the process with customers. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a traditional style hammam."

On the recommendation of \"Abdulah\", our friendly Taxi driver, we booked a \"Traditional\" package (580 MAD each) for our last day before we travelled, so that we would be completely zenned out for the flight home. By gum, it worked.. We woke up once for a cup of tea, and then again when we landed at Stansted.This was my first ever experience of a Hamman, so I hadn't a clue what to expect. The other reviewers on here (Thanks all) had done such a good job though, that I thought it worth trying. It was something else. We got a really secure locker each for our stuff, a white towelling robe and some slippers in the correct size, before being shown into a lovely hot (marbled) bathroom with comfy benches on two sides. I've not been washed all over by someone else for forty five years, so it was a bit weird at first but once I relaxed, stopped giggling and just let it happen, all was well. The exfoliating scrub was great (they give you the glove as a gift when you leave) and the mud coating was a novel experience. After twenty minutes at regulo 4, we were showered and shown through to the massage room, where my partner and I were both given the \"Relaxation\" massage. Legs, arms, feet, back, chest, head and hands - they chased the tension out with oils and a level of skill that must come from years of training.Les Bains were really good to us both, and this was a most pleasant introduction into the art of Hamman."

            "review": "Very elegant but lacking in substance. These baths are very, very chic and stylish from the entrance onwards and I think this is what you pay for in the price....The decor of the baths is traditional dark polished plaster walls, silk drapes, beautiful tiles and hand made lanterns with relaxing music and slim, pretty Marrakechis to guide you around the seductively lit rabbit warren of the baths. This is a Marrakech hammam that is definitely catering to luxury European tastes.You will only need to bring your own bathing costume for treatments and everything is kept in an electronic safe locker for which you always have the key to around your wrist. You'll need to book a couple of days in advance, even in low season as it is extremely popular with European and American tourists.I had the traditional wash and scrub (with gommage) and a relaxing argan oil massage. Total time was for 1.5 hours and cost me about \u00a360. \"Bargain\" you think......The hammam room itself was large enough for 3 to lie in their own area but unlike in a Turkish hammam, you lie on cushioned beds not on the marble itself, so the heat can't get to your muscles as it should which is a great shame. The washing and scrubbing was minimal with a quick 'wax on, wax off' style and nowhere near as thorough as those in Turkey, so the hammam part was a big disappointment for me.Just as the heat was nicely building up it was time to shower off and be taken to a rest room to relax on luxury couches sipping hot mint tea and bottles of water. This room was far to cool for me and we seemed to be there a bit too long before being led upstairs to the massage room.The massage I chose was 'relaxing' as having received 'relaxing' massages before in Turkey (only to be thoroughly worked over) I thought this would be more than enough for my tired, aching legs and shoulders. I soon wished I'd picked a deeper massage from the menu as this was far to mild and gentle and I needed something more intense for my aches and pains. My partner had a lymphatic draining massage and said it was the best he had ever had, so maybe he made a better choice than myself!At the end of the session we were led the another, larger relaxing area which is the courtyard in the centre of the baths, showing that this was once a large and plush Riad in the Kasbah area.More tea, water and little Morrocan biscuits are provided and once you have made your way back to the changing rooms to dress, you are shown to the exit lobby to settle your bill and maybe purchase some of the treatment products they use. I thought these were a little pricey and you can get much cheaper and equally excellent lotions and potions in the shops and markets in town.Leaving the baths you find yourself coming out of a plain back door into an alleyway, no graces or smart exit, but follow the path and you come back again to front entrance so you can find your bearings.Overall, Bains de Marrakech is a luxury pampering experience at article that would normally be much higher in Europe or the US, but if you want to experience a proper hammam scrub treatment and a good, quality massage I would try a more traditional hammam in Marrakech that the locals can recommend (or stick to the ones in Turkey). I have heard one called 'Ziani' in Marrakech about 5 minutes walk away just up from the Bahaii Palace is very well reviewed......."

It would have been nice to have the process explained to you but I think the language barrier prevented this. My partner and I had opted for the hammam, scrub and black soap with four hand massage to follow. This was a totally relaxing and authentic experience. The scrub was invigorating and the four hand massage bliss. The only thing was we were abandoned in the relaxation room afterwards for an hour, no one came to collect us and we had no idea how to get back to the changing room. We got rather cold by the end of it and tried to find where to go, also they don't tell you that you aren't supposed to leave through the reception area. They also didn't tell you where the toilets were, there were none in the changing room."

We attended the spa on the 18th December as we were interested in experiencing a special Hammam experience and a relaxing massage after a long day exploring.On arrival the staff weren't very friendly and we found the whole experience most of the staff were extremely unprofessional and constantly giggling and making jokes between them all.The Hammam was a waste of money and time with no explanation and no English spoken by the ladies who could barely communicate with us to explain what was happening. They weren't very tolerant either and it was basically two minutes of scrubbing and hot water thrown on you and the rest waiting in a room wondering when someone is going to come see you.The waiting time between all the services was very long with no explanation about what happens next.But the worst part of the whole experience was the massage treatment. The lady who was massaging was so disinterested to the point where at one stage I thought she had fallen asleep. she yawned about 50+ times and constantly sniffled and made funny noises in my face. The massage wasn't only the worst massage I have ever had in my life but made me feel extremely uncomfortable.At the payment desk I let the manager know about the experience and she didn't charge me for the massage only the hammam. But it was a long waste of our time and overpriced.It feels like a mass factory and the workers have little care or passion for what they do.I wouldn't recommend this experience to anyone. Not even If it was free."

We realised it would not be as authentic as a more local hammam but as we were not sure about hammam etiquette we chose to go for somewhere were they were more used to tourists. We were not disappointed! As we only had one hour to spare we chose the hammam followed by a scrub and a mask. It was lovely - really relaxing and a beautiful environment. We had been told that it was very expensive which it was compared to the more local hammams - but very reasonable for UK standards. Would highly recommend."

I have never had a hamman before so needless to say I was a little ignorant on the process, however I can only say that the four and a half hours we spent at Les Bains De Marrakech were some of the best hours I've had this year!It was only ten minutes prior to our booking that I looked at the reviews on here and realised I would be topless for the entire session.... eek! Something that I quickly got used to but was a little embarrassed with at first!We booked the Relaxing Day Spa session (for 2 people) which included the traditional Hamman, A 25 minute bath filled with salt and bitter orange and a one hour massage (approx \u00a365pp).The hamman itself was amazing! I wish I could speak a bit of French though as a warning I was about to get a face full of water would have been nice but I couldn't have enjoyed it more!After the most intense scrub I have ever received I now feel the softest I have ever felt and I am seriously considering a yearly visit....We went as a couple and there was only ever the two of us in the rooms and it was certainly relaxing. The bath was nice and so was the massage but it was the Hamman I would recommend!My only complaint would have to be the staff on the desk! They were quite rude and unapproachable the evening before when we went to book, and only started to be nice once we had given them a huge deposit.Also slightly disappointed that we weren't given access to the pool area, although it was locked off and empty out there so we wondered if it was a seasonal area? However it wouldn't put us off attending again, however next time maybe just for a hamman because that was the real experience!"

We booked a hammam and massage for 4 of us in our group and chose Les Bains as it came very very highly recommended by our Riad owners. We had 2 elderly mums with us and for all of us it was a first time hamman experience so we weren't entirely sure of what to expect apart from what we had been told by our riad owners.There was no clear direction from the time we walked in, like a lot of the other reviewers state, you are led from room to room without any explanation of what it entails. But it wasn't that which was so disappointing for us, after the hamman, which was in a communal room, we were led to a room to relax and have a drink of water and mint tea before being taken to individual cubicles for our massage. During our hour long massage, all 4 of our therapists left the cubicles every 15 minutes and got together outside and we could hear them laughing and giggling away. Not being an expert on these treatments, what I do know is that while you are having a massage it has to be uninterrupted and flow smoothly for the duration. One of the therapists was soooo rude that she even asked one of our elderly mums who is in her mid sixties if she had a baby in her tummy..... that I think was completely out of order and not the behaviour that you would expect from the staff of such a professional and reputable place.Having told our riad owners about this awful experience, they got in touch with the management of Les Bains and it disgusts me to say that they've had no response of any sort even after a follow up call.So all in all, a very expensive treatment in a very hostile environment. Next time, sure to try one of the cheaper places.."

My boyfriend and I had the hammam together and did enjoy it though it is a bit weird having a stranger rub soap and mud on your boobs and pour water down your boyfriend's shorts while he is showering!! We were a bit disappointed that we didn't get more time to sit and steam in the hammam, it didn't feel like 45 minutes but then we were in there for 3 hours so it must have been... We both loved the gommage though, where they scrub you hard with an exfoliating glove and all your dead skin comes off in flakes! After the hammam I went for a massage which was very nice and relaxing, not a super deep tissue massage like I would prefer but the masseuse was very good. I has assumed that while I was having the massage my boyfriend would go and get showered and changed and be able to read his book while waiting for me so I was surprised to see him waiting for me in the relaxation room they led me to after the massage, still in his robe, where he'd been waiting for the whole hour! He did say it was a little bewildering how they just led him from room to room with no particular explanation of what was going on, and it is fair to say that we did do a fair bit of sitting around in our robes wondering what was going to happen next... However the decor and surroundings are beautiful and tastefully luxurious, there was always mint tea on hand and the staff were friendly enough. There was definitely the feeling of being part of just a long line of tourists they were processing that day, but I suppose that's to be expected. All in all it was a pleasant and relaxing experience."

This was recommended to my friends and I by our Riad and boy, are we glad we booked!First things first, it's worth knowing that you have to do the Hammam topless. If you can be a little bit prudish (like myself) then it's definitely worth having this knowledge upfront - time to prepare yourself! I also read that if you wear a one piece then you have to remove the whole thing..! I was sure to pass this info onto the girls before our visit so we were all equipped with bikini's, protecting at least a little of our modesty..! When you arrive you're taken to the changing room and given a robe and slippers, you change into those and then go and relax by the pool until the girls operating the Hammam are ready for you. Once you're called for your hammam you're taken into a small stone room with heated floors and walls, this is where you have to remove your robe and bikini top, and you'll all be sat on beds facing each other while you're bathed in very warm water. Following that they lay you down and rub a moisturiser all over you - and believe me, they're not shy about it! It's most definitely a new experience..! Or was to me anyway. They'll leave you for a few minutes and when they come back you shower off the moisturiser and they'll rub a scrub into you which they then scrub off with an exfoliating mitt - again, bear in mind this is a very thorough scrub and may well be a new experience for you..! It gets rid of lots of dead skin though, and when they're done you shower again before being covered in mud. After this they leave you for much longer than previously and it does become a bit claustrophobic and steamy after a while, but fear not they come back eventually! You can then shower all the mud off, relish in your lovely new soft skin, re-robe yourself and head to the second holding room feeling slightly better acquainted with your pals (and the hammam girls for that matter..!). In the second holding room you can rehydrate with a bottle of water and relax while the massage girls prepare for you. After a while you'll be lead to your massage (these are carried out in separate rooms to your friends) where you can just completely unwind and enjoy a luscious hour of massage. Utter bliss!Following the massage you're taken back to a holding room to meet up with your pals once more, and it would seem that you can relax in here for as long as you'd like. Certainly no-one hurried us out anyway. They serve you mint tea and biscuits while you relax, or in my case try to become slightly less relaxed - I couldn't even string a sentence together I was so blissfully high!The experience is so worth the money, it offers a blissful 3 - 4 hours of calm in an otherwise hectic, bustling city. The only downside is heading back out to the craziness of Marrakech afterwards - it can be quite the shock to the system!"

The settings are wonderful, and from the moment you walk towards the spa you can see why they charge a premium price in comparison with the traditional hammams. We chose Les Bains de Marrakech as my boyfriend and I wanted to go to a hammam together, which isn't the norm in the traditional hammams for cultural reasons. Upon arriving, we were given the spa fluffy robes and taken to relax by the outdoor pool with min tea and water before our hammam and gommage session. The hammam and gommage session was an experience! My boyfriend and I weren't entirely sure what to expect, and at one point we were left in the hammam room alone together, not sure if we were meant to dive in and do the treatment ourselves. The ladies weren't very clear about what we should be doing or expect, so this was slightly confusing. The actual hammam and gossage though, was wonderful and we both came out feeling the cleanest we've ever been! A nice touch that you get to take away the exfoliating mitt when the session is over, to continue the tradition at home. Originally we hadn't booked for a massage, but we asked after our hammam and the staff were able to cater for us with just over an hour wait. We passed this time by the poolside once more (which is absolutely freezing, so this time is more often used purely for sunbathing it would seem!) with more mint tea. We had our hour-long massages in separate rooms, as they have male and female masseurs. Whilst it was a very relaxing, all-body massage, it didn't unfortunately get rid of the knots in my back as the masseuse didn't use a lot of pressure - if I went again I'd ask for a firmer massage up front. The whole experience cost us around \u00a350 each, which considering the prices we would pay in the UK we felt to be very good value for money, for a relaxing day."

This place is beautifully designed, offers a wonderful plunge pool and plenty of nice touches like aromatherapy oil scented relaxation rooms, mint tea and tiny biscuits but this is not why you go to a hammam and this is where the problems start - after being put in the steam room we were left for 10 minutes (I went with my husband) then two silent and surly women came in threw water on us, slapped on some soap and then left again - this took all of 30 seconds. They returned after another ten minutes, threw more water, scrubbed us and left us again. A pattern was emerging...after another ten minutes the silent duo reappeared and did their thing with the buckets of water and slathered on some other stuff (we didn't care by this point) and yes, you guessed it, left us for ten minutes. Fed up, with stinging eyes, and no idea what the hell was going on we got up and left the room in search of towels and showers. The silent pair reappeared as if by magic and, hilariously, managed to speak for the first time to tell us their names; I can only imagine this was in the hope that we might lose our minds and want to tip them for their utterly disinterested ministrations...After 20 minutes in a pleasant relaxation room we were taken for our massage which was fine if you like being slathered in oil and stroked for an hour. This was not a massage - with no attention being paid to muscles, deep tissue or joints.This is such a shame - the place itself is beautiful, wonderfully atmospheric and with lots of tiny touches that should make it a truly memorable experience; alas the thing you go for - the hammam and massage, are disappointing in the extreme."

            "review": "Luxurious relaxation. My husband and I booked a traditional Hammam, with an algae wrap followed by a one-hour massage for couples. After a short (albeit hot) walk from the square to Les Bains, we were overjoyed to enter the cool darkness of the spa. We were led to separate dressing rooms and given magnetic locker bracelets. After changing into our swimsuits, we were given thick terry robes and led to lounge chairs by the pool and given a bottle of nice, cold water. Heavenly. After a leisurely swim in the pool, we were asked to follow a woman to our Hammam. We were able to do the Hammam together. The room smelled wonderful and was deliciously steamy. Two girls came in to slather the savon noire on us and they told us to lay back and relax. The same two girls came back 10 minutes later to scrub us with the kessa gloves. (We were given these after the procedure was over.) After that, they applied the algae body mask and we relaxed some more. They poured buckets of warm water over us in between each soaping or scrubbing. When it was all over and we showered off, my skin felt like baby skin. It was wonderful. We were then taken to our duo massage room. It wasn't a deep tissue massage, but it was excellent. Just what we needed. After an hour of bliss, we were taken to a room with incredibly high ceilings and misters. We were given mint tea and cookies and did yet more relaxing. The facility is top-of-the-line. It's clean, beautifully done and the service is extraordinary. I know it's not the kind of Hammam the locals use on a regular basis but I didn't care. Superb experience. Do this. Double your pleasure; do it with your sweetheart!"

We arrived at 9.30am for drinks and relax in the courtyard. We were given fresh clean robes and flipflops. At around 10 am we were led into the steam room. In there we had eucalyptus oil rubbed into our bodies, full body scrub and clay mask. All interspersed between relaxation times. The whole process lasted about 45mins. Very nice. We were then led into another relaxation room where we had drinks. Next came a warm bath of salt and bitter orange. The bath was full of rose petals. This lasted about 30mins. Again relax back in the court yard with fresh orange juice to drink. Finally we went for a full relaxation body massage that lasted 1 hour. Once complete back to a different relaxation room that sprayed fine jets of cooling water. Biscuits and drinks. Wow! The place is fantastically decorated. Everything is kept totally fresh and clean. Really nothing negative to say. The cost was 850Dh per person about \u00a370. Not a lot when you consider we came out at 2pm. Four and half hours! The other thing to note is all our treatments were done together so my wife and I could enjoy the whole experience together. Very nice."

I am fortunate enough to work with some of the best resorts and spas in the world so I didnt expect the spa to have the same standard that I am used to. I was beyond blown away by the experience, service was top notch, facilities were spotless and everything was just amazing. The services started with the 45 minute hammam and black soap scrub. If you have not experienced this before, it may come as a surprise as its a bit abrasive and you have to take your top off. The ladies use buckets of water to rinse you off (similar to what my mother would do with a garden hose when I was a child and played in the mud), followed by a mud wrap that soaks for a softer skin. Once the mud mask is rinsed off, it was time for the oriental bath which was upstairs, the building is huge! Walked into a room that was filled with romantic rose petals and candles and it smelled like heaven! It was the most romantic thing I have ever seen, too bad I was sharing this with a girlfriend instead of a boyfriend! Then on to the massage, also the best massage I have ever had. I loved everything about this everience and so did my friends. Although the package lists times like 45 minute hammam and 1 hour massage, I am pretty sure that all of the services run way longer so you definitely do not get shorted for your money. Although two of my traveling companions had never left the US before and were quite shocked that the services include all areas of the body (no modesty here, it is normal to get your chest and buttocks massaged) they loved it so much they both made another appointment for the next day before we left from our first experience. The staff was fantastic and I would be back in a heartbeat if I could!"

Also, thank you to the masseuse who worked wonders! I even fell asleep during the massage.After that, I had delicious, home-made snacks and mint tea in a beautiful resting room. I also can\u2019t not mention the pool and the fresh juice! I\u2019m coming back to Marrakech in beginning October and I\u2019ve already booked a few treatments!

            "review": "Nothing to do with real Moroccan hammam. I work in tourism in Marrakech and have heard from many colleagues that this hammam is the best in the city. My friends from abroad were also very happy with this experience. So I dedided to give it a try.The beginning was really good. Enchanting oriental atmosphere, sensual fragrances, impeccable cleanliness, smiling ladies in Moroccan garments welcoming you. I was taken to the changing rooms, given an electronic key, a bathrobe and slippers, and left there all by my own, without any explanations. I waited for the lady to come and tell me what to do, in the end I had to go and look for her myself and ask her a lot of questions. She promised to show me the swimming pool after I finish my shower, but I ended up wandering through the labyrinth corridors all by myself again. Swimming pool part was good. They graciously allowed my to stay there for 1,5 hr instead of 0,5, because I didn't know about the time change and came early. However, the roaring heavy traffic outside didn't match with the calm atmosphere of the hammam at all. When the time came, I was taken to the hammam itself, again without any explanation. Although they knew that I understand French and Arabic, it's just not their style of work - to communicate with the customer. I was starting to feel as a prisoner or victim that has to follow obediently the orders of the jail keeper.The hammam woman was not gentle with me at all. She quickly made me undress, unceremoniously taking away my stuff from me. Quickly did the savonage, during which she painfully scratched my skin with her nails. When she started gommage, I asked her to do it properly, like in a real Moroccan hammam, so that my old skin goes off. She gave a stupid answer: since you took shower, your skin is clean. As her quick light movements didn't give any effect, I asked her to do it slowly and with force. But she clearly had no idea or experience of how to do gommage. I was just waiting for this terrible experience to end. After that I asked her to let me do my henna body mask by myself (I agreed it with reception before). But she insisted on doing it for me (probably expected some tips??) I was about to start crying, as she covered with henna my nails (that gives them henna colour that stays for a few days, and professional hammam women always avoid it) and even my private parts!! (painful feeling!) Then she ordered me to go to shower where I found just shower gel (although I was told that they offer shampoo).She didn't leave me in peace even there, constantly asking behind the door: ca va? ca va? (which probably meant: hurry up, I have a line of clients after you! you will take your long shower at home!) As I went out, she already collected all my stuff and was holding it out to me. My wet swimming suit was unceremoniously put in the pocket of my bathrobe. I was convoyed to the last stage of conveyor: the resting room. Again, without explanations (is it only for women? how long can I stay). Beautiful design, comfortable beds, relaxing music, a cup of mint tea... Unfortunately, I didn't care about it anymore. I just wanted to get out. As I knew it was useless to wait for assistance or attention, I wandered through the labyrinth again, till I finally found a staff member who showed me the way out. It didn't feel like I had hammam at all. Where is that feeling of lightness, cleanliness and rebirth?? A girl at the exit (a different door from the entrance), after my remarks, confessed to me that Moroccans don't come to them to do hammam. And that a real hammam requires time and relaxation. It's a purely touristic place that can make happy only those who have no idea about the real Moroccan hammam.I went out sad and disappointed.... For sure, will never bring my tourists there!"

Some of the staff just looked thoroughly miserable and the treatments themselves were a long way short of what we would expect for the cost.The Hammam itself was done in a perfunctory and half-hearted manner and the massage was really poor.I got the impression that the whole experience was geared towards getting as many tourists through the doors as possible and charging them over the top prices for low quality service. I left feeling disappointed and ripped off.If I was going to Marrakech again I would look to try one of the local Hammams rather than visiting here again."

We went here on our last day in Marrakech, my mum had a 1hr massage which she could not fault at all, and I had a hammam and algae wrap. The relaxation areas before and after the treatments are beautiful, and the staff are very friendly and serve mint tea before your treatment and another mint tea and bottle of water afterwards. Reception staff speak good English. I would only say that if you wear contact lenses take them out before your hammam!! Make sure you wear a bikini too. The lockers were secure and dressing gowns and slippers provided. Make sure you buy some of the products afterwards too, they are lovely, and quite reasonable given the quality. You also need to book in advance!"

The website is informative and engaging telling you about its owner and what they're trying to achieve.. All commendable and gets you believing into the concept before you get there. You are a informed customer therefore expectant. We booked a tradtional hamam as a couple which was supposed to last 45 mins. At the outset there seemed a dis interest.. Do they not need or want out custom? It seemed quite odd.. We were just left to our own devices chatting amongst ourselves for 15 mins.. Do we just wait here? A brief of what we were paying for and what was going to happen And the benefits of that would not have gone amiss.. This pattern was to follow throughout our time here. Lost in translation this was not.. There are without doubt plenty of able English speakers within the establishment.. That could take 5 mins and explain. Details and care that was absent throughout unfortunately.After a while we were taken to our changing rooms.. Exemplary they were.. Beautifully appointed and told to change to our smalls given a digital key on a wristband and told to leave all electrical devices in the locker. Once we were ready we were taken to the steam room told to relax then a couple of cups of water thrown on us. Ten mins later a woman came in and patted on some savon noir told us to lie on our back and went off. Fifteen minutes she returned and scrubbed each of us down with a mitt for less than a minute and ordered both of us to shower . As I came out she spent 30 seconds rubbing oil on me then we were left to relax. That was basically it! The 45 min experience! Steam room a bit savon noir and a bit of oil thrown in.. The experience was rushed and there seemed a total lack of empathy and care towards us and the experience we were supposed to have. Instead of if being something very personal it was very impersonal and we felt the person giving us the hamam was just going through the motions. For me it was like regressing back to being about 6 when your mother scrubs you down in the bath when you've been playing out too long . Throws a bucket of water on you and gets you out of the shower just as quick.. The feel was more of that than something luxurious that the surroundings thought it demanded.. I don't know maybe we didnt pay enough to warrant that service maybe you need to buy more than just the hamam.. If so why offer it?.. But a friend that used to work in no other than Giorgio Armani once told me the training they were given is to make the person who spends the least money more special or as special as the person who spends the most.. The reason he said .. Today he has bought a belt .. Tomorrow he will be back for a suit/ shirt / etc.. The thinking here was very short term.. And even though we are not going back with things like this news does travel fast..Having had a Turkish version of the hamam which we experienced on a recent visit to Turkey. This was refreshing stimulating and enjoyable everything the Le Bains wasn't. The settings, the decor and surroundings are exemplary but it felt all fur coat and no knickers. The ambience is and should be the added bonus.. The cherry on the cake. More attention communication and care needs to be taken. A more personalised and individual one to one attention approach where at least 15 to 20 mins is taken putting on the oil or whatever might make the difference. I could have been anywhere maybe my local leisure centre for all intents and purposes.. Wasn't much of a experience if the truth be told. I think saunas are widely available throughout most corners of the world including the uk which was what this was interspersed with some random woman chucking a few buckets of water at you every 20 mins.. Must have caught them on the off day.. Maybe...."

We had a really good time but a few things let it done for us. I emailed the company before asking if we need to undress at anytime during the spa they strongly said no. We started the treatments and before I knew she had ripped my costume down and was scrubbing me with another woman watching. Luckily I laughed it off as had an idea from reviews here that I would go topless but thought things would be explained before doing it. Then I needed to shower the clay off and again before I knew it she was rubbing me down very very quickly and at this point she had taken my bottoms off and rubbing my down everywhere!this I didn't like at all. We had an oriental bath which I recommend as it was pure luxury, it was very hot and at some points I had to sit on the edge of the bath but it was absolutely brilliant. The we would goth a room to wait for our next treatment which was nice . Our massage and facial was really good too, probably the best I've had. But the two massage therapists kept giggling and whispering to one another which made us feel uncomfortable. The tea and biscuits they bought round were lovely. The lady I had was called shama, she must have told us about thirty times. ( she was the the lady who gave us the shower) after our facial which was our last treatment, I asked if we could sit by the pool and have a look, I also said piscine aswell as swimming pool just so she understood us, she ignored us and took us to our changing rooms where before knew it we were outside. It is very rushed and it s like a maze in there but the decor is absolutely stunning, very relaxing bar the things I said I just wished we could of sat by the pool rather than being escorted out. We paid over \u00a3200for it too and it was a very special day,"

We bath booked The Traditional One and mentioned we were a couple. The decor of the place was beautiful, and after a short wait in reception, we were escorted to the dressing rooms. You do seem to be passed from person to person here, as the other reviews have said, but if you expect it, then it is fine.We were then taken to an outside pool area and brought some lovely fruity drinks and left to bathe for a bit. Into our hammam it was very lovely, we were put in the same room and left to enjoy the experience for a while. Every now and again a women would come in to add to the treatment by adding oil, then a mud like substance, after, scrubbing it all off.Having been left to rest for a bit more in a lovely cool room, we went for a Relaxing massage (same room again). It was so soothing. Even though the massge was a bit gentle for my liking, my girlfriend loved it.Feeling fully pampered, we were lead to another room and served biscuits, water and tea. There was no hurry to leave, so we enjoyed the atmosphere for a while.The only con I can think of is the lack of English-speaking staff, even at a basic level. So prepare your French! Other than that, it was such a lovely experience, and superb value for the money. We were in there for 3.5 hours, and paid around \u00a345 each. Even though there are cheaper places, very few offer this great quality and atmosphere. My advice, go early, enjoy the pool before your treatment!"

I booked a drained massage, which on their website is described as detox, muscular and invigorating. I chose a male masseur. I expected a good, strong massage. The therapist was only gently stroking me, kept me in the air-conditioning with no towels and felt cold, plus he spent more than 10 minutes just touching (not massaging) my head. When I asked him if I could have a stronger massage, he refused and said firmly NO. I complained with the french man (acting as manager) and he just defended himself by saying that a draining massage is not strong. I was wrong and it didn't matter that I wasn't happy with my experience, or that they are misleading clients with their descriptions. I am disappointed with their customer service, especially considering how much they believe to be one of the best (if not best) spa in Marrakech. With the prices charged, they should listen to people rather than challenging them. It's a shame, as my previous visit was fulfilling.

Amazing Spa!!We turned up an hour early due and the spa were so accomodating, leading us to relax around the pool with a refreshing drink until our experience was ready to start.All I can say is you must go, stress is just wiped away and the drinks and the little snacks are a lovely touch, no sense of being rushed through and the feeling of all the time in the world."

There was one hour of massage,45 mins of hammam and an oriental bath at the end !The one hour massage was great and our first hammam experience was good as well.Very clean and neat and tastefully decorated -the lighting and the soft music makes you feel like you are in paradise! After the spa you get to relax with some mint tea and sweets ! Water and tea is also provided after the hammam before you go for the massage.The staff are very friendly and although we didn't know the language it wasn't a problem at all -we were guided throughout. They have lockers to secure your items.To add to this,you also have the kasbah cafe around the corner which is brilliant of you want to have a meal overlooking the koutoubia .Will definitely come back."

All quite random, was left thinking \"is that it?\""

This year, I wasn't scrubbed properly, I wasn't packed properly and the Hamman experience which should have lasted an hour was over in 15 minutes. The massage was ok, but I felt like I was being short-changed the whole time. If the management are listening, please talk to your staff.

My friend and I booked on line about three weeks before our holiday which was straight forward and at each stage we received a confirmation email. So we had our spa booked for mid way through our week in Marrakech.The cost each was 850 Dirham. For this we steamed first with various scrubs, then had a warm rose petal bath finishing with a massage. Starting at 10:40 and leaving the spa at 15:10.From the moment we entered everyone was pleasant and friendly. The lighting is subdued with relaxing ambient music playing at a low level. They have very good lockers so your belongings are safe and dry with the spa providing the footwear and dressing gowns for you to use. Between each treatment we were given water and freshly squeezed orange juice and then left to relax for a time on wonderful couches in small side rooms before moving on to our next treatment.I was so relaxed by the time our massage started I fell asleep on the table and (much to my friends amusement) started to snore.I am happy that what we paid was a very fair price for the treatment we received and you can put together your own day by the combination of various treatments you pick from the website."

The changing room feels like it's in the middle of a corridor and despite one of my friends speaking fluent french, no one explained to us where the toilets were, where the towels and showers were and what to expect during our hamman and massage. The hamman treatment verged on unnerving with women entering and leaving our steam room with no explanation of what would follow. There were sharply delivered commands to 'turn over', 'sit up' and 'lie down' and we were left to steam without any idea of how long this would last or even what to do if we wanted to get out. For the massage we were offered either a relaxing or draining treatment. Although my french speaking friend asked specific questoins about the relative pressure applied in the different versions, she got no more information than they were different techniques. We decided on a draining massage and were all disappointed by the lack of pressure. We left feeling that the women working in the hamman were undervalued by the management who were running a spa sausage factory. Although this hamman was cheaper than other up market ones, I strongly advise you to look around for something else."

I've just returned from Marrakech where I spent two of my five days at two very different hammams, one being the much rated 'Les Bains de Marrakech', the other was 'Medina Spa'. I am a massage therapist to trade so I was interested to discover the Marrakech approach. Les Bains de Marrakech is truly a beautiful place to spend an afternoon and the treatments were good- I had a 45min traditional Moroccan hammam followed by an hours relaxing massage. The treatments were good but are not worth the expense compared to the same set of treatments at the less luxurious/ much less expensive ( but still very clean & pretty )Medina Spa in the heart of the Souk. The difference being the quality of the massage experience and attitude of the hammam girls. It was made very obvious at the end of my massage at Les Bains that my time was up and I wouldn't consider it professional to be making the bed up for the next client while I was still in the room! Neither is it professional for another therapist to enter the room to whisper to her colleague mid massage. The hammam girls at Les Bains were less than gentle let's say and I was starting to become apprehensive each time they entered the room. Medina Spa had none of these shortcomings and the quality of the massage significantly better. Regardless that the Medina Spa was less than half the price of Les Bains, I would definitely choose it over Les Bains time after time."

Then came the facial wow I lost count of the products used and time spent on my visage!!The final treatment was the massage don't expect a deep tissue sports massage as this is not the case but a soothing relaxing massage using the finest smelling oils, I think I fell a sleep a few times I just hope I didn't snore.After the massage we were then returned to a central room to relax. I think I sleeped again only to be woken by two song birds flying around the room, it really felt quite surreal!We then had some Moroccan tea and biscuits. We were also not rushed out of the central room but decided to go as we were unsure of the time spent only to be shocked to find out we had spent 4 to 5 hours in the Hamman (maybe I had snoozed more than I thought!)Treat yourself go for the package deal, you will not be disappointed!

The staff at Les Bains de Marrakech were pleasant and efficient. We opted to have a private hamman cabin so the two of us could go in together. Just wear bikini bottoms (and shorts for boys!) and they give you a bathrobe and flip flops to wear. You start off with the hamman (steam) - it smells lovely and is nice to have the privacy of the couples cabin. You then get covered in the famous black soap (that they sell on all the apothecary stalls around the city), you have a shower and then the therapists come in and scrub you with a mitt - just on the right side of painful! After this they apply a clay mask and you carry on steaming before a last shower - this part takes about 45 minutes. It was really nice and the eucalyptus scent was very relaxing and cleared our heads.We then relaxed in a lovely room festooned with rose petals before being served some mint tea.The massage was blissful and we were able to have this in the same room too. Lovely oils and a very good massage. Most relaxing after all the walking we had been doing around Marrakech. We then lay in the courtyard room (where there are birds tweeting around) and had some more tea and some Moroccan pastries. The changing facilities are very nice and they have security lockers to keep all your property safe. It's very nice indeed at Les Bains de Marrakech.There are probably cheaper places around town but I liked being able to book in advance and the fact that we could go in together. I don't think my husband would have enjoyed this sort of thing by himself. I would definitely recommend it. And it's in a nice part of town - near Bab Aganou (which is stunning) and the Saadian Tombs - which you should visit before the spa."

It is approximately a 10 - 15 minute walk from the main square or probably more of a 5 - 10 walk if you are familiar with the area and know the short cuts. (I'd recommend sticking in to the main roads that border the Palace).I had tried to book a treatment that morning via their website for a 4.30pm slot but I didn't receive confirmation by phone or email that the booking had been received. We took the risk and just turned up any way and they said they hadn't received the booking but they had a slot at 4.30pm and 5.3-pm available.I picked the treatment I wanted (A Hamman with body mask and 10 minute massage for 450DHs) and was led to a room to undress and put on a dressing gown and flip flops. They provide you with a locker key on a bracelet at Reception so you can lock your possessions away.I had come prepared by wearing my bikini bottoms and stripped down to just these and put the dressing gown on. I was the led to a dark hot room (more like a cave really) for the treatment. I would say if you are claustrophobic the room the treatment was in may be an issue for you but I found it okay. The women that did my treatment was pleasant and communicated with me using the odd word in English (I don't speak French) and a bit of hand gesturing.I enjoyed the treatment, when it was finished was taken to a shower to wash off the body mask and then led to an area to relax. This area was beautifully laid out and furnished (as all of the areas I passed through were). I was brought mint tea and some pastries whilst I was relaxing.I enjoyed the experience but have to say that as I did it on my own, I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had experienced it along side someone else (I couldn't persuade my partner to join me) Everyone else appeared to be in couples or with friends.If you are thinking about going I would say give it a go, relax in to it, don't worry too much about what is about to happen when / next (I am sure they won't forget about you) and I think you will enjoy it."

It was such a hit that we booked a second visit the next week. The second visit was just as good and paced the same. Individual girls differ in the application of the hammam and the massage but each was delightful, nothing at all to grumble about - not even the price (550 MAD each). I booked the first visit online from the UK and paid a deposit through Paypal. Just wish everyone else was so efficient."

Til you come in, you'll be pampered and accompanied in every time. The staff is always smiling and very friendly. The Turkish bath is a great experience. Take your time to relax and enjoy the music in the background and the mint tea on one of the loungers. Try the massage, too. it's intense and vigorous. At the end you'll feel regenerated and happy. Les Bains de Marrakech is an experience not to be missed!"

You turn up and wait for someone to take you to a changing room, then they come pick you back up. I thought we'd booked the black salt scrub and massage, instead we'd booked the one hour rose bath (in adjoining baths, in a candlelit rose-petal strewn room). Then we had a massage in the same room, beds next to each other and the massages were brilliant. At no point do the staff there actually tell you what's going on - we had no idea when to leave the bath, that we were supposed to ask for paper-based undergarments to change into for the massage (the masseuses we had didn't communicate well, and via sign language some embarrassing mistakes were made!) As others have said, when you're done they take you to a large space to lounge and recover, but they don't tell you that it's up to you then when you want to leave, they don't come back for you. And as others have said, when you shower (there were no towels for drying off) and pay, you then do get chucked out a strange side exit. It's as though you're a post-plastic surgery patient visiting the day after surgery and they don't want you to freak out prospective patients. Les Bains de Marrakech could be a top notch hamman, if only they communicated with people a bit better about what's happening!"

The ladies really do \"look after you\". Following we were given mint tea and water and chilled for 10 mins before being taken for a massage - which was great. Afterwards we were taken to a chill out room and given more mint tea and biscuits.

We visited in December 2012, the week after Christmas.I made a reservation two weeks in advance and paid a deposit by Paypal. I requested a 5pm slot for 2 people for an hour and a half. AFTER we paid, I was given a 5.30pm slot.We already had a dinner reservation at 8pm at La Mamounia, so I asked them to move our slot to any time earlier, but they refused, telling us they were extremely full that week.We arrived at 5pm on the day and were told to take a seat at the reception. We were one of several people waiting. We watched as several people walked in and received slots on the spot (so much for extremely full!!).We were still unsure on what the process was supposed to be and none of the staff bothered to explain anything to us. After about 20 minutes I got up to ask the reception what we were supposed to do and they told us \"Just wait, your hostess will come get you\"At about 5.40pm the hostess came to get us to lead us into the separate locker rooms. We were given robes to change into and led to our private hammam room. The hammam session we requested was for 1 hour. It was basically about 2 minutes of the attendant pouring hot water on us, followed by a 10 minute wait, then a 5 minute scrub, followed by application of a body mask, then another 15 minute wait, and then they let you take a shower.Again, the attendants and hostess did not bother to explain anything to us, so most of the time we were wondering what was supposed to happen. The hammam was not warm enough to qualify as a sauna, so felt more like a mildly warm waiting room for something to happen.After the shower we were led to a lounge and served tea. After about 15 minutes, I got up to check what was going on next, since we had booked a massage as well. The hostess told us to wait, and then 15 minutes later we were led out.To separate massage rooms, while we had requested a joint room. But we just did not have the energy to complain and request a joint room. The massage was with oil, and the masseuse did not respond to requests for more pressure. The massage was mediocre.Finally we were led out, and it was already 7.40pm, meaning we had to rush to shower and go to our dinner. Astoundingly, a large group of people had finished together, so both the dressing rooms were chockablock full. Literally, we had to fight our way to our lockers, and stand in line to get to the showers.The lockers here lock themselves shut as soon as the door is closed, and I found myself locked out as soon as I turned to get a towel, because sure enough with the number of people in the locker room, someone with the locker next to me closed my door, so that they could open their.A request to the staff to open the locker door went unheeded until we made a fuss and the manager came to open the door. We made it out the door at 8.30pm and had to call ahead to our restaurant to make sure they could still take us.All in all, not a great experience. The funny thing is, that very likely Les Bains is probably the best non-riad hammam in Morocco. They obviously put a lot of effort into the decor as opposed to the dank damp bathouses that you see when you pass on the street.Having said that, I think spas in Morocco in general have a great deal of catching up to do before they can approach the service level of spas in Asia. After having been to the Les Bains, I understand why the Angsana Riad in Marrakech chose to bring in staff from Thailand rather than train locally. The difference in service quality is vast, so it will be awhile before locally trained staff can approach global standards. The Asian standard is based on American service training, so they are much more systematic. First chat with the customer, explain in full what is going to happen and how long it is going to take. Next, never overbook the facilities. You're selling an experience, not trying to get maximum utilization of the facilities. If the experience is unsatisfactory, you destroy the brand image. And the brand image is what allows you to sell hot water and soap at 50 bucks an hour."

Being bit gosh and brit about these things I wasn't sure what to expect and was worried I might be covered in mud, thrashed with eucalyptus branches and offered an assisted shower. This place was wonderful. My wife and I had a sauna with some sort of rub down for an hour and a \"relaxing\" (as opposed to some other type) of massage. All of this was interspersed with time to relax, drink mint tea, sit by the pool etc. Really wonderful. It cost about \u00a340 each - a snip for what we had, in my view. We had a rude awakening after the 4 hours were up and we went back down the unprepossessing alley back into the reality of the dusty, noisy, raucous city centre. We nearly turned and went back in. We'd certainly have gone again the next day had we not been flying home. Ho hum. Highly recommended."

Then we had the massage, very professional and reamarkable. It took 50-5 minutes, with several steps. Then we had again a short rest with orange juice and cookies. If you will have a massage with argain oil including your head (and hair) after wash your hair. I didn't do that, so my hair just became a bit \"black and smokey\", I think it was the argain. It is not the cheapest bath in Marrakech, but the the service and the venue worth the money that you pay. \"A kind of must.\""

We had no idea what to expect, but just went with the flow. Each time there was a 'break' someone came and served mint tea in very calm relaxing areas. First we were taken to the changing rooms and given plastic sandals and bath robe, then taken to a warm room and had water poured on us. We were then left to steam before the ladies came and soaped us. Again a relax before they came and opened new scrub mitten in front of us, and scrubbed us thoroughly. It wasn't hard or painful or uncomfortable, just delightful pampering. They then gave us lots of soap and shampoo for the shower, and argan oil afterwards. No rushing or hustling along. Just bliss and relaxation. If you want to try a hamam then I highly recommend this one. The hamam experience was billed as 45 minutes, but we were there over 2 hours! And we werent even able to buy the oil, so no hard sell here!"

I then had a sort of body mask and we had more time to steam. I also had a massage, which was one of the best in my life. It was so relaxing!Les Bains de Marrakech are well designed and you get given mint tea at various stages of the process. The only thing I would say is that you aren't really told what is happening or how long you could be waiting in different parts of the hammam, but if you don't mind this, and lets face it, you're on holiday so don't have to be in a rush, then it isn't too big a deal."

In between hammam and massage you're invited to lie down, drink tea and relax and not only are the staff helpful and friendly, but it's a really valuable cultural experience and a good contrast to the heat and frenetic activity outdoors.

There is a lovely old and finely decorated arch nearby and to the right of it are two smaller archways. None of these are to be confused with the archway which leads into the city through the old external walls. To the immediate right of the right-hand archway of the set of two arches (I can't believe I'm having to type all this - and all without pay!) is a small alleyway leading to Les Bains. The entrance is attached to the inside of the city walls. Celebrate a little when you finally get there. One problem was my locker key not working. Interestingly you are told the locker number but it doesn't appear on the bracelet. You would think this was a good security measure but in fact locker key no.2 actually opened no. 6's locker. It only took me seconds to try 10 lockers. Ok - so keep your bracelet on you at all times (even during wet treatments) and don't take any valuables. The gommage I had was fine and the massage ok...it was a little too light for my tastes but this is generally the Moroccan style, which is far removed from the bone breaking Turkish massages or deep-tissue English style (sports) massage. One big plus was the fabulous opulent decor but one big minus was that I didn't feel any personal contact from the staff...I was herded around at the same time as other customers almost as though I was on a conveyor belt. The turnover here is quite big, however, and so it lacks that intimacy that can be found elsewhere."

All I knew was to take a spare pair of knickers (ladies you don't need bikini's or swimsuits) and not to be shy. Thank goodness we booked a private hamman as I am not sure how the dynamics of a public hamman would work. The first half an hr consisted of a full body scrub and soap wash. The first drench of water over our heads from a bucket was possibly the funniest, but perhaps was what we needed to break the ice. Following the steam room, we had 10 mins or so to relax in robes on a lounger with a glass of mint tea and had a foot rub and face massage. Bliss!Then followed a one hr full body massage. Both myself and my boyfriend were in the same room and had a simultaneous massage which I have to say was possibly the best I have experienced ever (and I've had a lot of massages). The ladies were keen to please and often asked if the pressure was right and left for about 10mins afterwards for us to take in the relaxation. Overall, a truly sumptuous experience and worth every penny. Such good value for money considering the surroundings, attention to detail and outstanding service. Highly recommended!!

We went with the least expensive hammam experience- full scrub down, massage and such, and did not think we were missing out on anything. The rub down was great (I still have and use my glove!), and the relaxation rooms between steps were wonderful. My massage was great (and not for the inhibited!) and super relaxing. I went with my husband and we were able to share a room. If I could do it again I would have spent all day there. They let you use the pool, order food from the hotel, and just veg. Oh man, I'm dreaming about one of those cuddly white robes right now..."

It began with a mud, body scrub in the sauna, followed by an incredible relaxing massage (so relaxing I dozed off twice), then I opted for a traditional facial treatment. It was brilliant. The sauna can be rather stifling when you first enter but if you ask them to leave a widow open whilst you adjust it is okay. The staff were wonderful and the whole setting is very relaxing, clean and inviting. They even serve you mint tea and little pastries. Reserve the whole afternoon as the pace is slow and relaxing. My session took about 4 hours. If you need to unwind and recharge your battery this is certainly the place to do it. I would strongly recommend this experience in Marrakech."

Perfect relaxation experience amongst the hustle and bustle of the Medina, what's not to like?Good value spa experience - we opted for the traditional spa experience for a couple at 1100 Dirhams (c\u00a345 each), which includes a hamman (similar to a Turkish bath) and 1 hour massage (you can choose a relaxing massage or a lymphatic stimulation one instead).The staff were brilliant and attentive throughout, stopping calmly to gently guide in such a natural way even when they were doing something else. The setting was great, more recently decorated yet still in authentic Moroccan style with lots of dark wood arches etc.I wouldn't have changed anything about this experience to be honest - it was exactly what we wanted on what was otherwise quite a busy schedule in Marrakech. The only slightly tricky aspect was finding the spa itself but basically head towards the area between Kosybar (marked on the tourist map) and the tombs and it is in that area - we asked a couple of people for directions along the way and they were really helpful.Finally, book a couple of days in advance as it gets fully booked due to its popularity."

It was interesting to say the least! Then we were given dressing gowns and taken to a relaxation area for tea (only one cup allowed) before our massage.

I made a reservation via the website a few days before leaving the UK and paid a deposit through PayPal. This process was very straight forward. As soon as we entered the reception area we felt relaxed (which was lovely after spending the morning in the souks)The ladies on reception spoke english and were very efficient. I felt nervous and excited at the same time as this was my first hammam experience (we booked the traditional hammam, gommage and 1hr relaxing massage) Once we had changed into the robes and slippers provided we were ushered through to the pool area and given some fruit juice. After about 20 mins we were taken through to the hammam were my husband and I were in a room together, even though I had not booked a private hammam we were the only two in there which was lovely!Then the fun began! The ladies who perform the hammam do not speak English but were really lovely and made you feel at ease, they really made the experience good fun even with the language barrier. I am THE most self conscious person and didn't feel comfortable removing my bikini top but this was not a problem. After we were steamed and scrubbed we were taken to room to relax with mint tea.The venue is amazing and it was a real treat to be pampered away from the madness of the medina. "

Not even a clear top coat and all over the show) for 10 minutes and then I just sat there for the rest of the time. The color I picked was going on fast enough - so the girl insisted on a different color. It didn't appear that any of the instruments were sterilized and I'm pretty sure I was given water from the tap. It was at the very end of the day, so I'm sure the girl was just rushing it because she wanted to finish early. Saying ALL of that - if you don't care about pedicures - definitely go!

We got the recommendation for this Hammam through our hotel Riad Libiti Bito (highly recommended).At first, the prices seems quite high for Morocco, but after nearly 4 hours of pampering you quickly realise that it is really worth it.The atmosphere is magical and very relaxed. It appears that they can only attend 5-6 couples at each time, so it never feels crowded.Arrive at least 30 minutes in advance to enjoy the little pool in the patio and receive a complimentary orange juice. All you need with you is a swimming costume- the towels, shoes and a bathrobe are provided.We selected the Duo Traditional Hammam and Massage priced at 550MAD. Firstly, you are lead to the private hammam room, where you get to relax, warm muscles and then two ladies come to apply soap and let you rest 5-10mins. Then they return to scrub you with loofa and apply a sort of gel. Again you rest 10 mins and then they return to put another product similar to peeling mud. After shower, they take you to rest and relax with a mint tea and water for cca 30 min before you are taken for your 1h long massage.The whole place is beautifully decorated, with lovely soft music and essential oil lamps. The staff, women only, are very pleasant and helpful but speak only basic English.I highly recommend this place as it gave us a wonderful few hours of relaxation in a bustling city."

But since it was our first time in a Hamman - we just went with it! I also had a pedicure at the end - the lady started to say something but realised I didn't speak French so didn't go any further. The reason for my review was the ending.....the bill! We'd already paid around \u00a3150 in deposit for the whole treatments for the 7 of us - so when the bill came, it was a bit of a shock - the receptionist when I queried it said \"no it is right\" so I then had to break it down for her! I was annoyed as they charged us 30dhs for the application of nail polish in the pedicure (that must have been what the lady was trying to tell me!) and I just said I want the whole bottle for that?? They also charged us for the black \"exfoliating gloves\" - which they HAD to use during the Hamman - when I said we don't want it - they said we had to purchase it....so beware of the \"add ons\" they don't tell you about - which still didn't explain why the total was about \u00a3100 more then what I had worked out.In the end - the receptionist saw my working outs and agreed I was right....no apologies though - it was enough to ruin my thoughts about the Hamman and wanted to warn others about it!!I don't think I would go again because of the wrong change experience - but if you do decide to go.....check your change!"

An oasis in the heat of the city - first enjoy a glass of fresh orange juice by the pool and then sweat it out in the sauna area before the rest of the hammam treatment, involving black soap and lots of scrubbing, then relax in soft robes with mint tea. Everyday should include a visit here. Fairly priced (150d/person), lots of other treatments available, book in advance though."

Once you get to the 'rest' areas and the outdoor courtyard (common area so you are all in your bathrobes, hanging out with your own group), everything melts away and it's pure relaxation. It's a good hammam with very reasonable prices. You must make a booking and sometimes they require that you make a deposit via Paypal to hold your booking when they are super busy. Booking via email is easy, just go to their website and follow instrucitions. In French and Arabic only. Hopefully English will be available soon."

How disappointing! 1.Staff welcomed us without smile,2. Hammam treatments which was supposed to be 45 min. Instead- shower, staff put oil in few seconds and left, they come back after few minutes-shower and after scrub maybe 2 minutes total- 1 on each side, then shower and mask. Total time in hammam maximum 25 minutes. 3. Massage was a joke- it was relaxing and clean setting, yet the massage was so soft that I was feeling bored not relaxed.I asked the lady to use more pressure and she did for few seconds then stopped, asked again, but after initial minute she come back to soft strokes. She massaged my head 3 times,each time so softly and weirdly pausing with her hands in my hair, maybe she thought I was sleeping...I thought she could spent more time on massaging my body than sitting and playing with my hair.4. Yes,it is beautiful place and you receive your tea and sweets, yet staff is not very attentive and friendly.I asked for comment form and left my observations, staff didn't even say goodbye. Overall I would not recommend further.Average experience."

I booked a traditional Moroccan experience for MAD550 which was supposed to last for an hour and a half but it was nearly a 3 hr experience. On arrival you are shown to your locker where you can leave your clothes and belongings and you are given a robe and sets. As I was early I sat and relaxes by the pool. I had the hammam, followed by a black soap wash and then a scrub and then a body mask. This probably lasted 45 mins and was very relaxing. My massage was well over an hour and was divine. She even massaged my ears!!!! In between treatments I was taken to the relaxation rooms and given water and mint tea. My husband started to wait for me in reception but they gave him a robe and he sat and chilled out around the pool area. They even gave him drinks at no charge!! It's really easy to find. Our taxi driver dropped us right outside at the entrance of the kasbah. I wore bikini bottoms and a top and they do ask if you want to remove your top. I did and I didn't feel intimidated at all. A very good experience. Just wish I had time to go back!!!!"

We both opted for the traditional Hammam with black soap scrub and then a relaxing massage. For our last day in Marrakech this couldn't have been a better way to relax and scrub the dust from the city off ourselves! The staff were friendly and helpful, the decor was beautiful and the whole place had a lovely chilled atmosphere. There were high standards of cleanliness and hygiene! Me and my Mum both agreed that the massage was the best we have ever had.It was also very reasonably priced - we were there for about 3 hours, were offered numerous drinks and snacks, were never rushed and paid about 45euros each. You would probably pay twice that in Europe or the UK. There may be cheaper in Marrakech but for quality we would definitely recommend Bains de Marrakech!Tip: Take conditioner as this isn't provided and a comb as you will need to wash your hair. Wear either a bikini or just underwear and be prepared to take your bikini top off as it is generally expected! It also helps if you speak some French as most of the therapists speak very little English!"

The place is well booked up and a slot was available only for 9 a.m. Ok. Arrived 20 min before, the place was closed, waited at a nearby cafe 10 min or so. Eventually went in, the receptionists are rather desinterested, after a few minutes were escorted to get changed and to put bathrobes on. Looks like all bathrobes are the same size, so if you are more then 12-14, you just look plain silly. I was really lookinf forward to a nice hammam, my friend and I were deposited on 2 matrasses in a dark room, they through some water over us and left us there! We did not know what was happening and for 15 min or so nothing was! Then 2 ladies came, slapped some soap on us and left us again. Returned after 10 min or so, gave us a 50 sec scrub (didnt overdo it) and told us to shower. The shower was tiny, situated behind rickety wooden door, the drainage was poor, my frien had to step in after me, not ideal! When I asked for hair conditioner, the woman looked at me as if I was asking for the moon. They we stayed in a rest room for 15 min or so, massive room with lots of people. Then off for the facial, it was quite good, but all exfoliation liquid, scrubs and oils ended up running down my neck and into my hair! At the end you come out of a different exit onto the side street and the receitionist is not in the slightly interested and speaks virtually no English. Just \"pay and go\" kinda attitude. After such a \"special\" experience ended up on the street with stuckup oily hair. I coud not wait to get to riad to clean up. What a joke! All in all, nothing special and extremely expensive. Staff totally disinterested. DONT BOTHER, GO ELSEWHERE!!!"

I visited with my boyfriend and we both had a massage treatment. When we arrived we were greeted by a security guard who walked us from the street to the reception where we checked in. We were then taken through to separate male and female changing rooms. You are given a bracelet which is the key to your locker, robes and flip flops are provided and the area where you change is clean and nicely kept. We were then led through to the outdoor pool where you can sit and have a drink and relax before your treatment. After about 15 minutes we were led up stairs to our treatment room where the massage was done. The massage was lovely and they used really nice oils. One thing that surprised me was that they put a lot of oil on my face and then massaged my face so be sure to remove your make up or tell them before hand that you don't want oil on your face. After the massage we were taken down to a relaxation room where were served mint tea and some pastries. I fell asleep and was awoken rather abruptly by a member of staff and told I needed to go to the changing room however they then realised it was full and tried to send me back into the room but we asked if we could sit by the pool. At first they refused but then allowed us. the water in the pool was freezing and there was also a funny smell to it but the sun loungers were very comfortable. Overall this is a lovely spa and the treatments are very reasonably priced compared to London however the staff do need to work on their manners as we found them to be rather irritable and surly. As the spa is so busy is does feel a bit like a production line of clients going through too. Be sure to book in advance of your trip if you want to visit and arrive early so you can enjoy the pool before your treatment."

Thereafter you are taken into the steam room which is quite hot - it is very dark in their with relaxing music & soft lighting - so much so that I had not fully adjusted to the light when the lady came in and chucked the first of many buckets of warm water over me, which came as a bit of a shock but left my husband shrieking with laughter until it was his turn. I have never been so relaxed - the clay mask and scrubbing left my skin glowing and smooth. The massage was wonderful too, just right and the oils smell amazing.Afterwards you are poured back into your robe and lounge in the covered courtyard with mint tea and yummy treats until you are ready to get dressed and leave with the mitt they scrubbed you with.A few tips...dark underwear/bikini/bathers are a must, robes & flip flops are provided, secure lockers are provided in the changing rooms free of charge, shower gel, shampoo, towels and a hair drier are available in the shower area, but not conditioner. Leave youself plenty of time as you will not want to rush this fabulous experience."

A friend of mine recommended LBDM so we booked online before we flew out - this is really necessary since they book up very quickly. We booked a week in advance but think 2 weeks is better since we didn't get the slot we originally wanted.We went for the relaxing full day spa which is totally worth it. We started off relaxing by the pool with lovely fresh fruit juice, and were then taken to have the hammam (ladies you will be asked to go topless!). The english of the staff isn't great here but enough to get by (instructions like 'turn', 'shower', 'turn again'!) but everyone was really friendly and helpful. Ater the hammam we showered and were taken to a relaxing area where we were served mint tea and water. After some time we were taken to have our massages which were sublime! Truly relaxing and you just feel so light afterwards. After this (oh yes there's more!) we then had an oriental bath which was a lovely soak in water infused with oils and strewn with rose petals. Finally you are taken to relax again either by the pool or in a room and served mint tea, pastries and fresh fruit juice again, and are free to leave when you please. You need to allow plenty of time to fully enjoy the experience, we totally lost track of time and ended up spending four hours there! Mainly because we weren't sure what to do after we were taken for the last relaxing part and hung around until we thought we better leave! It was such a lovely experience and everything from the friendly and helpful staff, to the stunning decor, to the clean facilities and the atmosphere and vibe of the place that makes you feel like royalty is something that should not be missed when in Morocco. We had a free hammam at our hotel and it just didn't compare. Also, they give you the exfoliating mitt they scrub you down with which is a nice touch.We went as a couple but saw lots of groups too, and when booking it's worth stating you want your treatments together. Overall, simply wonderful!"

It was truly a magical, exotic experience.Initially we were taken to a u dressing room with lockers to store your clothes and valuables. We changed into huge, absorbent robes before being led to the massage room. The massage was indulgent and all body over. I especially enjoyed the upper shoulder, neck and face massage. On cessation of the treatment, a towel covered your body, the light dimmed and you were left for 10 minutes to absorb the tranquillity of the surroundings! Later you were escorted to a Lou ge bed area and offered sweet mint tea and Moroccan biscuits. You could relax as long as you wishes before walking back to the change room, showering and changing back into street clothes.A truly indulgent and magical massage experience! Beautiful and exotic interior to the establishment. Highly recommended."

We both chose \"relaxing\" massage. *Tip to ladies (and gents) wear a dark colored bathing suit if possible. Especially if you choose an option with a plant masque - the plant goop is very dark colored and I'm not sure it'll ever rinse out completely from my suit!The hammam itself is gorgeous and decorated in traditional Moroccan style. The place is simply ENORMOUS with room after room! Like any spa, it is soflty lit, and smells AMAZING. My husband and I don't speak french very well, but luckily both ladies at the desk who helped with our reservation and check in spoke english.Upon arrival, we were taken to separate dressing rooms to change into our bathing suits and put our belongings in a locker. As other reviewers have mentioned, keep some dhs in your robe pocket as you will not be able to go back to get tips!After changing we were taken to a steam room of sorts, where I was instructed to take off my swim top. Being naked in the presence of strangers is NOT my thing (esp with the hubs in the room.......just weird for me!) so I insisted on keeping it on, which was met with confusion, but she eventually let me be. We were showered off under a shower in the room, and left to soak for about 10 minutes.10 minutes later, our attendant came back and slathered us in black soap. We were then left to bake another 10 minutes. Upon returning we were VIGOROUSLY scrubbed and watched the dead skin just melt away (yes, it's gross...but that's the whole point!). I'm actually glad I left the top ON otherwise she might have scrubbed my \"chest\" right off!!!After the scrub, we rinsed off the goo under the shower, and were covered with a plant masque ...(face too) and then left to soak for yet another 10 minutes, before a final shower off. I walked out of that hammam with my skin soft and glowing.As a bonus, they rinse and wrap up the mitten (\"kessa\" glove) that they use for the scrub down, for you to keep, which I have used in the shower at home MANY time since with great results!We were then directed to a waiting lounge of sorts, with lots of beds paired together, and separated by wooden screens. We lazed about for around 20 minutes, eating cookies and drinking bottled water and mint tea while we waited for our massage.Then we were collected by 2 masseuses and lead upstairs for the massage portion. We had booked in for a \"relaxing\" massage, versus a \"draining\" massage.The massage was THOROUGH. I literally don't think she missed an inch (yes ladies...this means FRONT too...the WHOLE front). My only complaint (my fault!) was that the \"relaxing\" massage was little more than a rub down. I would've loved a bit more firmness, but it WAS relaxing all the same. Just not my typical preference for massages, but for $60 for the whole she-bang...you can't really complain!After our massage, we were lead back down to the \"lounge\" area, more tea/water/cookies and were left on our own to lay around as long as we like. Once we decided to get up (before we fell asleep) we headed back to the dressing rooms and I enjoyed a final shower, in a beautiful private shower stall with glistening gold fixtures and an assortment of moroccan shampoos and body washes that all smelled divine!The \"spa\" is really top notch. It is spacious and beautifully decorated. We never felt rushed. The facility was spotless and the masseuses/spa ladies were very professional. It was an excellent value. The only thing I regret is the timing (we shouldve done this on the LAST day, instead of heading back for another day in the heat and dust of Marrakech!) and I do wish I had booked in for the \"draining\" massage instead, for something a bit firmer.I would highly recommend this spa!"

Relaxation in a steam room, then a traditional body scrub with black soap (vigourous) and more relaxation before a shower. Mint tea and morrocan pastries served in the relaxation room before being escorted to a room for a lovely relaxing massage. Would definitely recommend."

            "review": "value tranquility in dream like Moroccan surroundings. One of my workmates had been to Marrakech a few months ahead of me and suggested I get a Hammam at Les Bains. On my last day there I had been quad biking in the morning and was at loose ends for the afternoon. I felt I had seen most of what I had set out to see and remembered the tip about the Spa. I went to scout it out and found it just around the corner from the Sadian Tombs. They were kind enough to fit me in despite not having a reservation (top tip - make a reservation as this is a popular place and although it worked out for me I think it was only a bit of luck). I booked in for a standard Hammam and was shown into the changing rooms which were very smart. I was then robed up and shown to a courtyard plunge pool and sipped some tea listening to the singing birds. I was then taken to my Hammam room, and showered under some cold water. I was left to relax for 15min and then was soaped up and left again for another 15min. I was then rubbed with a mit like sandpaper and then showered off all my dead skin. I was then doused in oil and robed up again. I was shown into a very nice relaxation room and brough tea and bottled water. After about 30min of peaceful reflection I changed and paid. (150 dh has got to be the deal of the year for me) You get a lot for your money here! They show you out the back door so I had to weave my way back to the front door to collect my girlfriend who was waiting in the lobby. I was in trouble as she thought I had slipped out passed her and went out shopping (they kindly gave me a plastic bag for my wet swimsuit). All in all I really belive I couldn't have ended the trip in a better way and the setting and facilities are top notch. The cooridors are darkly lit with beautiful Moroccan lamps, at times you are greeted by the smell of incense, and the sounds of trickling water. A treat to the senses and I would without a doubt do it again. I did say as I was leaving, if I had done it on the first day I would have been tempted to do it every day of my visit."

I wanted to experience a hammam, but was a bit nervous about it, and came here on a friend's recommendation, bolstered by the comments on this site. It was awesome. Very comfortable for a novice like myself. People were lovely, the spa itself is beautiful beyond expectations. It was relaxing and so tranquil there, in rather marked contrast to the part of Marrakesh in which it is located. I had the hammam, scrub, clay mask and a one-hour massage, and enjoyed every minute. After changing (choice of wearing a bathing suit or underwear), I spent a few minutes in a lovely garden courtyard waiting for my treatment to begin. My private hammam cabin looked like an exotic cave with white chaises against the walls, and the lady who took care of me was very professional and lovely. I was comfortably warm, well scrubbed, very happy with that experience. The cool shower after to remove the clay mask felt good, and was followed by a rest on a chaise in an interior courtyard, complete with billowing curtains and black pierced lamps and sconces, and even a cup of mint tea. The massage was in a restful, elegant space, with just candlelight during the massage. Another rest in an interior courtyard with mint tea and cookies ended the experience. All for a price of an average massage in far less exotic surroundings back home. Happy camper."

There are assistants around to guide you around the confusing warren of corridors. The look of the place is very good. The wash was done by two women, and was pretty vigorous. The steam we cooked in stayed just on the right side of bearable/unbearable. The massage was excellent, although I wouldn't have minded it a little firmer. (There was choice of draining or relexaing massage, and we chose draining. But it was still relaxing enough to send one of us to sleep!) Small cakes and tea were served.I found the changing rooms less plush than the rest of the place. There was nowhere to put my shampoo in the showers (and, after the head part of the full body massage, my hair was full of massage oil). And the lockers were simply too small and had no hangers, so coat, dress and all had to be bundled up and squeezed on top of boots and bag. (Presumably if you go in the summer, you'd have fewer clothes to cram in, but it would still be nice to be able to hang them.) Also, there were no toilets attached to the changing rooms; there were elsewhere along a corridor.I would love to go again!"

I think the problem here is they are basically offering a pretty slick hammam experience for tourists in a busy part of town and it has a tinge of spa factory about it. You even go in the front door and come out the back door at the other end! Maybe they just need to ease back on the number of treatment rooms or get larger premises!Having said that at 1000DH for 2 people to have a hammam and one hour massage it isn't bad value compared to what one would pay back in blighty..."

Because I had just gotten my nails done I couldn't put my hands under the blankets. I didn't feel relaxed at all.The hot stone massage was welcome warmth after the previous treatment.

They brought us mint tea to warm up and then took us to a private room.We had friendly attendants but because nothing was explained it was a rather baffling experience. Including the moment when she removed the top of my swimming costume! Then we were left in the room, soaped up and I began to overheat. My boyfriend was fine. Then she returned with another attendant and I experienced a very vigorous and extensive body scrub while my boyfriend experienced a less invasive clean. We were showered off and oiled up and taken to relax in a cool room and brought more tea. As an experience I would advise those (who like me) are uncomfortable with nudity in front of strangers to be wary. However it did give me a good holiday story to tell my friends! Altogether though quite stressful and un-relaxing first spa treatment experience, though my boyfriend found it very relaxing."

The interior is extremely modern, clean, whilst a feeling of relaxing. My girlfriend and I started with a sauna then a body scrub that removed a lot of skin then had a mud cream put on us, this lasts for about 45 minutes. We were then put in a room with some mint tea to relax before the massage. The massage lasted for about 1 hour 15 minutes and was very relaxing throughout, covering head to toe.

After reading great reviews on TripAdvisor & a recommendation on a Fashion blog I follow, I decided to book a relaxing afternoon/evening at Les Bains de Marrakech.Since I was visiting with my partner, after reading the reviews & looking at the website, I decided to book us in for the couples 'Traditional duos', which consisted of the usual Hammam, Gommage, Scrub & Seaweed wrap, with an hour-long massage, which worked out just under \u00a345 each.I pre-booked online, picked the package, date & time I wanted & received an e-mail (in French - EEP!) back with a different time in the subject line, so do take note of that when you book. I know enough French to know it was a Paypal payment of a 50% deposit... & there was a link to click, which took me to Paypal (also the French version, but after signing in all I had to do was keep clicking the next/confirm payment button).We walked to the spa from the main square & all we knew was to head towards the Kasba. I asked a traffic cop for directions en route & he confirmed that we just had to head through the Kasba & it would be the first Hammam we saw.When we entered the Kasba, we thought that the Spa couldn't possibly be nearby. The roads were dirty, smelly, litter was everywhere, the shops were dire, it was like we'd stepped back a few centuries. We carried on through the Kasba & as soon as we'd walked a couple of minutes & reached the other side, there was a sign for Les Bains de Marrakech, pointing down an alley. We followed the sign & were happily surprised to see a beautiful entrance with red carpet, rose petals etc. Once inside, the receptionist asked me whether we'd like relaxing massages or draining massages, then told us to take a seat. Before long, somebody came out of a curtained doorway & told us to come through. We were given a gown & sandals, led to a waiting area & shown lockers & told to change into underwear & the gown. I'd highly recommend a bikini instead of underwear, though (unless you're a man, of course).Somebody came to get us & led us to a waiting area - a room with 4 beds covered in white towels - and sat back to relax while they bought us Moroccan Mint Tea. Shortly after, we were led into a small dimly-lit room, with plastic-covered beds on opposite walls & were told to sit down on each bed, topless. I'm quite comfortable with my body, but thought the way she said it was a bit strange. However, I adopted a 'when in Rome' attitude & stripped off down to my bikini bottoms.Then, an older woman threw buckets of warm water on us, then we were left shut in the room without a word & steam started to generate. Not knowing what was going on, when she'd come back or what to expect next, was as funny as it was confusing. 5 minutes later, she came back in, covered us head-to-toe in a brown sticky goo, then left again. More steam, more baking. After around 10 minutes, I had to go & open the door to cool down. The woman arrived shortly after & scrubbed us head-to-toe with what felt like a scouring pad. More water splashes, then the seaweed wrap. Except that this was less of a 'wrap' as it was just smothering me in it. Again, she left & more steam flooded in.After another 10 minutes, I was starting to feel like a crackling pork roast & went to open the door again, except that it didn't cool me down much. Just outside the door was a shower, so I turned it on. The woman showed up again, led me back into the little room and threw some cold buckets of water over us. Then led us to the shower.I walked into the shower and no sooner had the water hit my face, when I felt someone pull my bikini bottoms down. I turned around & my partner was in hysterics, the woman even laughed at my knee-jerk reaction & I carried on 'in Rome'. After smothering me in shower gel, washing me ALL over & giving my armpits a tickle, she motioned me to put my bikini bottoms back on, then the robe, then the sandals. Then did the same for my partner.We were then led to another waiting room upstairs, with only 2 beds in it... & brought more Moroccan tea. After 5 minutes, we were led to separate rooms & the hour-long massage commenced.I was massaged from head-to-toe & everything in between, front & back, for an hour. The massage itself was pleasant, the ambience was peaceful & it was a nice touch that when I was face-down, instead of looking at a plain floor, there was a big bowl full of rose petals on it.The one complaint I had about my massage (which I've seen more than once on other TripAdvisor reviews) was that my masseuse was yawning & coughing every few minutes. Instead of relaxing, I was too busy thinking about the germs that were now flying around the room, & since the windows & doors were closed, I was paranoid about acquiring said cough.After an hour, I was left in the room for 5 minutes without a word, then the lights were turned on on Miss Cough-a-lot's return, indicating the end of the massage. She gave me a new robe, led me next door to find my other half, then we were led into a beautiful room with 8 beds in this time, 4 on each wall, facing each other, & a water feature in the centre of the room, filled with rose petals - truly beautiful! There were other couples sitting chatting, & then we were all bought more Moroccan tea & some cookies.We chose to leave shortly after, we were led back to the changing area & made our way out, feeling very relaxed. Paid the other 50% of the payment on my way out.One tip - because of the size of the spa, it's inconvenient to return to your locker at any stage. If you intend to give a tip (which you will), make sure you take it in the pocket of your robe."

            "review": "Impersonal, unattentive massage which left me like an oil slick. We decided to take a quick massage at Les Bains de Marrakech before our flight out of Morocco. Unfortunately, despite the treatment menu offering a large variety of massages, we were not asked about our preferences or requirements on arrival, and simply whisked into the experience like pieces of meat on a production line. I had showered prior to arriving and wanted to tell my masseuse not to put oil in my hair or on my face, because I had to catch a plane, but was not given any opportunity to speak to anybody about my requirements. The masseuses were lazy (they sat down for much of the massage, with their shoes off, and spent about 15 minutes of a 1 hour massage massaging my hair, which was not enjoyable), and used so much oil (baby oil or olive oil...something that didn't smell nice) that I felt like I was a piece of meat about to be grilled. When they massaged my face, oil went into my eyes, which wouldn't stop weeping the rest of the day. We were not given disposable underwear (as we were at Mythic Oriental Spa, a much nicer experience), so our own undergarments were covered with oil after the experience. I needed to shower again between the massage and my flight as I was dripping with oil, top to toe. The time spent on massaging the upper back and shoulders was quite enjoyable, but it was too small a portion of the massage and was overshadowed by the uncomfortable experience of being lathered in so much oil that it was nearly humiliating. If you want personalised, attentive service and an enjoyable massage with (a small amount of) scented oil, go to Mythic Oriental Spa instead."

We were showed the changing rooms and then taken into a Steam type room, I was asked to remove my bikini top, which fine, but I don't overly like exposing my top half to people I don't know! However I went along with it, they then drenched us with buckets of warm water and left us in the room! They came back about 10 mins later and put a body scrub all over us, and went off again. They returned used a hammam scrub all over us, which was quite hard and went off again, then we had a mud scrub put all over us and we were left for about 20 mins, boiling hot! They then rinsed us down. I was glad to get out of there it was becoming to hot and we were left for so long, it didnt really do much for me. We were then moved to 2 seperate massage rooms, the massage was nice enough, they are quite gentle certainly not like the south east asians do it, but depends what you like. There was a lot of giggling going on at one point, and our ladies went out to see what the laughing was about, and promptly joined in laughing and whispering, it was clearly at someone which wasn't very professional. I then had the facial which was nice enough but again she kept leaving the room? My husband said his hot stones massage was the best bit. I liked it and it was nice and relaxing, but I don't love this sort of thing and probably wouldn't go back. We paid about \u00a375 each."

The building is 8 years old (we asked), and is built beautifully, in the same style as the rest of old Marrakech. We were pampered from the start, and even allowed to have our hammam in the same room, which was great. Tea and a cookie during the interim... then a full-body, one-hour massage. At the end, another tea in a beautiful, giant room where we decompressed for 10 minutes.All in all, this was super relaxing, and well worth the cost.

We sat on benches and then two women started chucking water over us. We were then covered in various ointments and muds and scrubbed (don't go with sunburn is my advice!!). It took around an hour for the whole experience as after each layer of stuff we were left to cook for around 15 mins. It was a strange experience as the women knew very little English (apart from \"sit\", \"turn over\", \"yes\", \"no\"), so we werent sure exactly what were were supposed to be doing!We then were showered off and went off for our hour long massages. These are ALL OVER BODY. I am fine with this but having spoken to a few other guests in our hotel they weren't sue if this would have been right for them, so just be aware.

Our riad booked us in to Les Bains with my direction of 'everything' which i had gathered from another guest was the full 3 hour experience including massage etc. However, when we got there we only had a 1/2 hour hammam booked and they had no slots for anything else so we decided that would be fine and we could just get more exploring time on our last day! We were both led to different changing rooms and shown a locker and a gown and left with no other directions. I didn't know what to wear so left bra and knickers on and went out in the robe. I was shown in to a dark room and asked to lie down on a table adjacent to my boyfriend. Hot water was poured over me a few times and then the asked me to take my bra off and rubbed some slimy soap all over me. Then, without a word, our two attendants got up and left! We lay there for about 10 minutes until we started to feel a bit chilly, then they came back and scrubbed us with loofahs until our skin felt like it was going to come off. We then got how water poured on us again and were led to a shower at the side of the room where it was indicated we were to rinse off. Once out of the shower we had oil poured in to our hands and told to rub it in all over which we did. Once our robes were back on, we were led to a room with massage beds through it and asked to lie down and we were brought mint tea which was lovely. That was the last we saw of anyone, and, about 20 minutes later, having become a bit bored of lying in our cold wet robes in a cold room, we called someone and asked what we should be doing and they said we could leave! All in all I found it to be an interesting experience, and am glad I know what happens in a hammam. Is this a first class establishment which looks after you and makes you feel comfortable? No! I think next time I'll go to a local one for a snip of the price and mingle with the locals!"

On our arrival it all appeared calm and relaxed before the receptionist came into the waiting area and seemed to be having an argument with someone on the next level up who we couldn't see. We were then taken into the Hammam room which was lovely for the most part. Towards the end we were rubbed down with something or other and then just left while the 2 girls whispered away to each other which defeated the object of relaxing.We then were taken upstairs to the massage room which again, started off really nicely but at one point I opened my eyes and saw my partners masseuse looking at a text on her mobile phone. This happened twice which I thought was rather unprofessional. Pretty much throughout the massage the girls had a whispering conversation with each other.At the end of the massage they both left the room and we were left wondering what to do as they had not informed us that the massage was over and to take our time getting ready. We lay there for a while and then got up. The dressing gowns were the same ones as we had come from the Hammam with and were wet and cold which wasn't very pleasant.It was OK I guess but certainly not the best I've had."

We booked the Traditional One (45min Hammam & black soap body scrub and ghassoul body mask +1h Relaxing massage). After the hammam we showered and stayed in a nice room to relax with mint tea and cool down after the sauna. We then had the most relaxing massage - I must have dosed off a dozen times. More tea and biscuits afterwards. The whole thing lasted about three hours and cost \u20ac50 each which I think was definitely worth it.Watch out for the motorbikes when you get out, it's easy to forget you're in Marrakesh while you're in there."

After much research on TA and elsewhere, I booked a traditional hammam/massage at Les Bains de Marrakech for my husband and me at the cost of 550 dirhams each. I emailed them with my preferred date/time and they emailed me back the next day to let me know that it was available. They requested upfront payment of 50% by Paypal with the rest payable after the treatment by credit card or local currency. We were also advised to bring a bathing suit.Les Bains was tucked behind the medina walls by the Bab Agnaou gate. The interior featured exquisite colorful tiles, glowing lanterns and wooden latticework.The hammam part began with us being placed in a small heated marble walled room where we rinsed off and then were scrubbed with black soap and painted with liquid clay. Then for 20 minutes we were left to rest in the steamy hot room. After rinsing the clay off, we were led to the relaxation room for 5-10 minutes and given mint tea.After tea, when we had full body massages which I enjoyed despite the pressure not being all that firm. My husband's masseuse fell asleep twice while massaging his head which he found annoying. Overall, I thought Les Bains was good value for money and would go back. Not sure about my husband though!"

I went in November 2011, for the Traditional Body One package, which includes 45 mins of hammam and body scrub, an hour of hot stone massage and an hour of relaxing body massage. In actual, the whole thing took 4 hours to complete as there's waiting time in between sessions for mint tea. The best thing was the hot stone massage! It was heavenly. The hammam experience was a good one too. The worse is the body massage, which supposed to be relaxing. It's anything but! They used waaaay too much oil, halfway through the massage, I felt like a fish ready to be deep fried. The massage itself was not good, the lady was simply rubbing the oil around. During the body massage, the lady who was massaging my mum even sneezed on her face!!! They all should use face mask!!! The facilities was very nicely decorated, however they could have put more aromatherapy in the treatment rooms. So, the hot stone was good, the hammam was average and the body massage was horrible. Overall rating: Poor."

Main issue is towels on lounges are just refolded after a persons use, even if damp as person just out of pool or shower-i was surprised as thought you should either use your 'own' towel or a fresh towel should be replaced for the next person. Alsolots of waiting on lounges in rooms with others between treatments, would benefit from offering water or mint tea in between times if waiting/ relaxing/whatever. Mint tea and Moroccan biscuits at the end."

They took us to a room with beds to relax and have a mint tea before the massage and again after the massage so We did not feel we were being rushed out.

This time we had the oriental bath and energizing hot towel massage. This place has a truly luxurious Arabian nights type of atmosphere, the interior and the quality of the treatments are outstanding. Book well in advance via their website, and arrive about 45 minutes before your appointment so you can take advantage of the lovely pool area in the courtyard. The building is like a big maze and the whole procedure might feel a bit confusing (what with moving from room to room), but the trick is just to wait for someone to pick you up at each \"station\"."

We had all opted for the traditional hamman and black soap scrub and I was looking forward to feeling squeaky clean as I have had such treatments in the past. We had booked in for 6 pm with a view to catching the last of the sunshine poolside.The facilities and the layout I can not fault the problems lay entirely in the service. The whole experience was extremely dissapointing beginning with a disinterested welcome, to not being offered drinks and being left to wait endlessley by the sunless pool area without any idea of what was happening. The main problem was in the actual treatment. We were taken to a private Hamman which was nice and left for 15 mins wondering what was going on. After complaining we were individually rubbed with oil wich took about 15 seconds. Then we were left again for a further ten minutes. When the \"therapists\" arrived with their gloves they simply went over each limb with 3 strokes of their glove taking a total of less than a minute per person. We were then instructed to shower and taken to yet another room to \"chill\". Where no refreshments were offered. All in all an awful lot of sitting around waiting and very little spa experience. I certainly didnt feel squeaky clean and felt like the staff were simply badly trained or lazy."

The attention to detail is impeccable: moody, Moroccan lighting; stone carvings on walls of changing room; some of the most relaxing chill-out music; fine mist spray in final relaxing room to cool you down at the end of the treatments; amazing decor everywhere.You must try their 4 hand massage and rose covered bath \u2013 pure indulgence. Slight niggles which just made it short of perfection:1) pool is too small to swim and unheated, and as shaded a lot does not get heated by hot weather. I\u2019d say its for show rather than use, which is shame as would have been nice to have swim between treatments. 2) Understandably not all staff speak English but I would have liked to have been able to communicate by massage preference ie. deep, before massage started, as tried to explain this a few times to no effect. Still v relaxing 4 hand massage though3) Mist spray in final relaxing room not switched on when we entered but only after further customers were shown into room4) Other than at beginning and end I felt I was having to ask for water/mint tea rather than staff being conscious to this.

We had the relaxing day spa experience as a couple and the hammam and massage part of this were fantastic, really worthwhile and we were together throughout. The bit in-between however, an oriental bath, wasn't all that and in hindsight I would have saved some money and gone for the hammam and massage separately.This is expensive but then all good spas are so it's worth the experience but I'd suggest doing your homework and knowing the treatments if you're going to go for a day experience so that you make the most of it.

We did a 3 hr package (hammam,scrub,cataplasm,massage and facial) and was great! Not only the treatment were very pleasant but the atmosphere and the care the put in the experience is great. When we checked in we were escorted to the changing room and than to the pool area , offered a mint tea and than gracefully brought to the hammam ( they are vey attentive and always check that everything is ok) from there we relaxed in beautiful room on soft and white crisp loungers with relaxing music and moroccan lanterns (amazing!). After our massage and facial we were escorted to the courtyard (that has been covered with drapes) to rest a little longer on the loungers , this time as well there was music, tea and little cookies. After few minutes they started to spray a rose/water mist in the air . It was a great morning and an experience that I would suggest to everybody! Les bains de Marrakech is truly amazing and as soon as you enter it transports you in a 1001 night dream!"

I love going to spas and so whenever I go away I can't resist going for a couple of treatments.This is one of the most beautiful places I've been to and unbelievably reasonable as well.It's easy to go for the same treatments as I know what I like and so I decided to try a couple that were a bit different. I opted for the Tonic Spa which started with a Hamman, followed by an algae bath and then a hot towel massage.Firstly, if you are bashful then this isn't the place for you. Although they say to have swimming costumes with you from the moment I started the hamman I didn't wear it again for any of the other treatments.It was my first Hamman and something I'll have again when I return. I was literally scrubbed and cleaned and my skin felt amazing afterwards.The algae bath was one of the most beautiful rooms I've ever been into with rose petals and candles leading the way to the bath with was completely covered with more rose petals. It was pleasant but not something that I'd have again as I prefer treatments where people are doing things e.g. facials and massages.The hot towels massage was amazing. It was a standard massage but towards the end they put these steaming hot towels over your back and down your legs - they're so hot they feel as though they're going to burn you and when removed you can feel were they were - but it also feels amazing!Everyone is lovely there and in between treatments you get Moroccan tea and freshly squeezed orange juice - which is yummy.All I can say is.... go on, treat yourself!"

            "review": "Not everything I'd hoped for. I booked a couple's Traditional package which includes a 45 minute hammam and 60 minutes massage and saved this for our last day in Marrakesh as a final treat. We arrived a bit early because I'd read that you could spend a little time by their pool, and we wore our bathing suits for this and the hammam. The pool area was cozy with room for maybe 10 guests, but the water was quite cold and most of the area was shaded. At one point some young men in the pool were talking loudly and a manager came from inside to shush them, which I later found ironic. So the first part was ok, they gave us orange juice and we relaxed there for maybe 20 minutes before they led us to the hammam. Now this was not my first hammam, so I know how good the experience can be - or bad, in this case. My husband and I were shown into an attractive enough private room with heated surfaces and lay down on the waterproof cushions on two sides of the room. After we had warmed up a bit two female attendants rubbed the black soap on us and disappeared for a while, then came back, rinsed us off and applied the clay layer. Somewhere in this was an exfoliation, which I only remember because I have the glove - everything these two women did was perfunctory and I felt like they couldn't have cared less about us. In between their brief appearances I assume they joined the group of women we could hear gossiping in French somewhere nearby, which completely blew any chance of serenity we might have mustered in that room. In truth, even though I'm not sure we were there 45 minutes, we were ready to finish with the hammam. Next they brought us to a resting area, which yes, was beautiful and quiet and atmospheric with comfortable beds. A woman came by offering mint tea, but after filling our small cups she went off and never came back to ask if we wanted more. In the Banos Arabes throughout cities in Spain, there is usually a room with pots of tea where you can help yourself to as much as you'd like as you move between areas. Here, it would have been nice if she had just left the pot with us because we were both thirsty. The massage at the end was actually excellent and very relaxing - again in a private room, here lit by candles, with two different women, this time friendly, who seemed to care how we felt. This redeemed the experience to some extent but were I to return to Marrakesh I would pick a different hammam."

It was recommended by our Riad owner and I'm not sure that we would have found it as quickly without his excellent directions and map. It is situated a little out of the way.The spa itself was spectacular and my partner and I were able to have our treatment together (a traditional Hammamm body scrub). Beware that there is no modesty in these types of places! Although I had my swimming costume on, the top half was duly removed! However, you are not made to feel uncomfortable. Excellent price considering the treatment 500 dirhams for both of us (approx \u00a340). Would definitely recommend you give it a try. Be advised though that you may need to book ahead as it is quite popular and can get busy."

The spa was an amazing experience and very reasonably priced for the treatment received, 550 DHS for 45 min Hamman and 1 hr Massage. I was aware of having to take off my bikini top which didn't phase me in the slightest. The hamman was great, a real feeling of having all the dust and dirt of the city washed and scrubbed away. The relaxing areas between the treatments are truly tranquil. Mint tea is served throughout our stay which we had become so fond of during our stay in Morocco!! The massage was fantastic, we choose the relaxing massage option. Although i have heard reviews stating it was hard to find we did not find it to be. We simply got a taxi to Bab Agnaou and the spa is sign posted clearly on the right hand side at the gate. We left feeling completely relaxed and revitalised. Highly recommend"

            "review": "Absolute bliss tucked away inside the medina. Visited in July 2011 with a friend, found the whole experience to be totally perfect and very relaxing. Started off in the steam room, getting sloshed with water every now and again followed by the scrub. Although they made us take our bikini tops off, which we were hoping to avoid, it really wasn't such a big deal in the end. It obviously makes it easier for them to do their job, and I figured if they're not bothered about it then I shouldn't be either. Although I have to admit I wasn't prepared for when, lying on my front, they yanked down my bikini bottoms and gave my bum a quick buffing! But it just made me laugh more than anything. Scrub was excellent, really felt as though they were getting all the grot out of my pores and very relaxing also. Was then taken to the relaxation area and given lovely sweet mint tea - yum. The rooms are beautiful, and I was starting to feel seriously chilled out at this point. A lady arrived to take me upstairs for my massage (I had the Traditional One, Hammam, Relxaing Full Body Massage and Oriental Facial Care for 950DH). Again I was asked to take my bikini top off, but obviously no-one else was in the room, so not a problem. The massage was wonderful - and definitely 'full body' - even the tips of my fingers and ears were done! The lady who did it was lovely, we even had a bit of a chat in French, but she didn't talk to me during the treatment so I could just lie there and relax. I was then escorted to the room where I had the facial - again very friendly staff, and the treatment was bliss. All the people who were working there were very attentive; before I left the room the lady double checked I had my key to my locker (I'd put a load of stuff in the pocket of my robe and for a minute or two couldn't find the key) and then took me down to the pool. The courtyard with the pool in is absolutely beautiful and very peaceful; you would never think the craziness of the medina is on the other side of the walls. We were given more mint tea and some lovely little pastries. The only downsides to the whole process were, firstly, the booking online - my friend paid the 50% and, although she was asked to pay 550 DH, the amount she paid in pounds sterling actually translated into 580DH... Although I think we did manage to get them to acknowledge this and reduce the balance we paid at the spa. At the time however, it was a bit confusing. The only other criticism I would make is that they don't seem to let you return to the changing rooms (and your locker) until you are leaving. So if, like me, you leave your sunglasses in your locker, you won't be able to go back after your treatments are finished to grab them for sunbathing. I think my friend did manage to sneak back in to get something, but I was ushered back out to the pool! These are only very minor points though - more just areas to be aware of than real criticisms. As for comments below about it feeling like a 'conveyor belt' - I wouldn't say that is the case at all. Yes, you are escorted on to your next treatment when they are ready for you, but it is extremely smooth and efficient - I'd feel more annoyed if I was left for hours between treatments wondering when I'd be going, so I'm not really sure what people who feel like its a conveyor belt are after? You have plenty of time to relax after treatments - you can stay there for as long as you want - so, in my opinion, the way they run the whole process is spot on. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Marrakech, without a doubt. Probably one of the best things I did whilst I was there, and excellent value for money. The equivalent of what I had would probably set you back at least \u00a3200 in the UK!"

On arrival at the spa we were told that they have not got our reservation (due to mistake of Riad) but they were able to fit the two of us in for both the hammam and the massage straight away which was great! We were first showed to the pool to relax before taken to the hammam. However the 45-min hammam turned out to only involve 3 mins of actual treatment time. Nothing was explained to us, we were put into a steam room and left there not really knowing what was meant to happen (as our first time). Then 15 mins later a lady came in to run soap on us and walked back out. Another 15 min went and 2 ladies came in to give us a 3 min body scrub, and then they disappeared again. Another 15 mins passed before someone came in and showed us to the shower! The scrub was pretty below par.Luckily, it all got better after this! We were showed to a lovely area to relax with mint tea after the hammam. The massage was good and the room was nice and very comfortable. After the massage, we were showed to another area to relax with mint tea and pastries before leaving. All in all it was a good experience but I probably wouldn't go for the hammam again, massage is nice though!"

After emailing which treatments my friends and I wanted I received a paypal invoice for 50% deposit. I was emailed a receipt and confirmation of booking shortly after paying. The remainder was paid by credit card after treatments.It was a wonderful experience - starting with a cooling dip in the pool (in 100+ degree heat outside). The ladies who did the hammam were matter of fact and efficient - but that's half of the experience. The massage was lovely and relaxing. The only slight negative is that my friend had the 'draining massage' which seemed identical to the relaxing massage. We were in there for three hours or so and the time flew by.The spa itself is tucked away in the alleys at the other end of the main square so it took us a while to find it (including a run in with a local who decided to swear at us when we politely declined his help) but that's not the fault of the spa! In summary, I would definately recommend this. Without hesitation."

The booking process is a little tortuous and I had to wait a week for a reply to an enquiry via the website but the receipt of the deposit was confirmed fairly quickly.You do feel really pampered here (albeit a bit like you're going along a conveyor belt as they move people around each stage of the hammam) and the endless tea as you move through each stage was very welcome. I would recommend that you come near the end of the day when you are all tired out from the souks and just chill out and relax.The hammam was much better than one we had the week before in Fes (although that was still very good) and involved quite a few stages of scrubbing and body masks etc. We had massages afterwards which were really relaxing.The staff are very attentive and when my husband accidentally left his watch in his bathrobe there were about 5 staff running around helping to relocate it!Well worth the money!"

            "review": "Lovely tourist experience - a one-off treat. I booked Les Bains de Marrakech as a treat for myself on the last day of our week in Marrakech. My husband didn't want to go but I was quite happy to go alone and I am glad I did.I opted for The Traditional One - which comprised the hammam, gommage and rhassoul mask followed by one hour of relaxing massage and then an hour's hot stone massage.I have had an aromatherapy massage once in the UK (it was a Christmas present) and I wasn't too taken with it. I found it too expensive for what it was. But for the same equivalent price at Les Bains I was getting the whole package. It seemed a pampering sensation too good to miss.The place itself is beautiful serene and induces an almost trance-like state of relaxation. The staff who greet and escort you to treatments are deferential to the point of coldness - you can't induce them to chat, even in French, and I did feel a little bit like a colonial master being waited on by servants. My hammam girl was lovely and friendly though and we chatted in a mixture of French and broken English interspersed by the very basic Arabic I had learnt on Youtube. I had intended and expected to go fully naked - however she made no attempt to remove my clothes so I kept my bikini bottoms on out of respect to her young sensibilities. My large, bare white backside is no joy to behold for the young and innocent!The savon noir was massaged into my skin and then showered off, followed by the scrub with the kessa mit. This was the only part that really disappointed me. At home I exfoliate twice a week with those rough scrubby gloves you can buy - and I am merciless on my rough spots. At Les Bains, no matter how many times I asked her to scrub harder, it still felt as though she were terrified to rub too hard in case she got in trouble for damaging the \"rich white woman's\" delicate skin. After the scrub she massaged rhassoul into my body and face and left me to relax a little longer. As others have said before, the hammam room never gets particularly hot - certainly it wasn't as hot as the temperature outside - and with the door to the room continually being opened and closed, you get blasts of air conditioned cold air regularly wafting in.After a relaxation period in a dimly lit area (where I may have fallen asleep!) I was taken upstairs for my massages. The relaxing argan oil massage was wonderful - not deep or rough but she worked out all the knots on my neck and shoulders and the head massage was bliss.The hot stone massage however, was a revelation! Before going, I had remarked to my husband \"this is going to be a bit of a let down - when I have seen it on tv they just lie hot stones on you - how can that do anything?\". I was so wrong. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil the surprise for anyone else but it is utterly delightful. If you suffer with joint pains and rheumatoid arthritis, like I do, this treatment will give you a pain relief that you never dreamt of. It was wonderful. I did nearly fall flat on my face going down the stairs afterwards though because I was so relaxed that my legs had turned to jelly! After mint tea and pastries and another restful lie down, it was time to leave. There was no rush but I was a little hurried because I was being picked up outside the spa and didn't want to keep my friends waiting.I entered the spa at 12pm and left at 4:15pm - although I could have stayed longer if I had wanted.All in all it was an amazing experience, my skin felt soft and smooth and was glowing from the rhassoul mask and the argan oil massages. I would definitely recommend the hot stone massage to everyone and would even consider going back there to have it again next time I am in Marrakech.The actual heat room, soaping and scrub was perhaps a little disappointing however. It definitely felt like a watered-down, pampering version for tourists rather than a way to actually get thoroughly clean. Next year when I visit Marrakech I will definitely be braving a locals hammam and experiencing the different rooms of varying temperatures plus a thouroughly skin-stripping scrub!Was it worth the money? Yes absolutely, especially compared to the cost of massages and spa days in the UK. Would I recommend it as a treat for yourself? Yes, it is a lovely little pamper session to relax you after the bustle of the medina. Is it in any way a representation of real hammam tradition? Not that I could see, no.Maybe I am just not cut out for a life of being waited on hand and foot and treated like a dleicate flower - who knows? I would say that if you do go you will enjoy yourself but if you don't go you aren't missing much that you can't get in any spa around the world."

We had a cabin for the three of us so if you are a little body conscious then you should request a Hammam on your own. When in the hamman we were scrubbed and then a mask applied on, once that was dry the ladies came in and washed you down. We booked a hamman with wrap and massage. It was very relaxing. You get Green tea and biscuits after on the sun loungers which is a perfect finish !In comparison to the other Hammans this is probably on the expensive side for the locals but pretty reasonable if you are a tourist. The only gripe I would have is that we felt like we were rushed from the changing rooms and also we didn\u2019t feel the hammam got hot and steamy enough as the ladies came in very frequently to either scrub us or wash us down.

We booked the 'traditional' which was a private hammam (for 2), followed by a 1-hour couples massage. It was an excellent value at 550dhs - about $70 US dollars. We made our reservation online and paid a deposit via paypal with no problem. They were expecting us when we arrived a few minutes before our scheduled appointment. It was our first time in Marrekesh and as non-French speakers we found communication and directions to be very difficult overall. It took longer than we expected to find Les Baines, even though it was only a short (10 minute) walk from our riad in the Medina. It\u2019s off the main street and not clearly marked\u2026unless you are specifically looking for it. We walked past it several times until a police officer pointed us to the entrance. The nearby vendors will try to lure you into their shops as you enter and exit. Just be very polite, yet firm and they will eventually give up. We've been to many spas in the United States and we both found Les Bains de Marrakech to be more luxurious than most. The property and d\u00e9cor are beautiful and relaxing. The mint tea and almond cookies are delicious. The locker room facilities for men and women are similar to what you\u2019d expect at a luxury resort spa. First-timers should be warned that there is very little modesty at this spa. Be prepared to be completely naked during the treatments. Of course in public areas you wear one of the spa\u2019s white robes. I was initially wearing a swimsuit under my robe, which the attendant quickly removed (without my consent) during the hammam. They made my husband remove his swim trunks and gave him a very small pair of swim briefs (think: child\u2019s Speedo) to wear. Thankfully, it was a private room and quite dark, but it was still unexpected and a bit shocking. Before the massage, I requested that she cover me in a towel for privacy - so only the area that she is currently working on is exposed. She complied (sort of), but I was still quite uncovered and during the massage. Also - no body areas are off limits. My husband and I were both rubbed in places that American spa massages don\u2019t go. We'll admit - it was a great massage and it wasn\u2019t inappropriate, it\u2019s just that we are accustomed to more privacy. It was actually rather comical for both of us to face the fact that we are \"uptight Americans\" when it comes to nudity. I wish we\u2019d known a little more in advance so we could have mentally prepared and been more comfortable during the wonderful treatments. Nonetheless - a wonderful experience."

Well worth a visit, make sure you book in advance as getting a space was tricky and we had to go to pay a deposit before the day of our appointment to secure the booking. It is conveniently placed just around the corner from the Saadian tombs."

And it is very reasonably priced for what it offers. I opted for the traditional experience of hammam and a relaxing massage. The staff was friendly and polite, though spoke very little English.

This cost about \u00a3100pp, which is much cheaper than you'd get back in the UK at a similar establishment (albeit not as cheap as is available in Marrakech).It was thoroughly romantic and both of us commented on how good our skin felt afterwards.Good tip - go at the start of the holiday, or you'll find that all that tan you've worked hard for has gone.I'd recommend this to anyone, but must ask, why oh why do you go in through a gorgeous entrance, but you go out into a little side alley, completely lost and not sure of the way back to the main road? Why don't you just go back out the entrance - surely the faces of people looking so smooth and refreshed would be much better marketing?"

Relax in the tranquil environment away from the crazy souks and hustle and bustle.It is quite expensive though. We paid 950 dirhams each for a hammam, and two one hour treatments. At times, it also felt like we were on a tourist conveyor belt with different members of staff in and out of our room doing different bits of the treatment. I would have liked a more personal approach. I might be tempted to try a traditional non-tourist hammam next time just to compare the service. The hammam itself felt a little rushed and I felt as though the person doing the massage didn't really enjoy it so made my experience not a good. Despite this, I would recommend this place if you can't compromise on your western comforts/surroundings!"

So much so that before leaving Morocco I bought black soap, argan oil and a hammam mitt and I am determined to keep up the routine :)The facilities at Les Bains are great, beautiful changing rooms with showers and hairdryers, robes and flip flops are provided and the staff are lovely.A treatment like this would set you back in the UK but to my surprise is was only Dh250 per person."

After undressing, and putting on a robe, I was guided into a dark, warm and moist room where I was commanded into the shower, and then told to lie down. First, a huge woman scrubbed my whole body. It was painful the entire time, and I had to bite my lip not to scream. Afterwards, I showered again, and then she rubbed mud all over me. I was then left to relax while my body was burning. When she came back, I showered and dried off. I was then guided into a room full of sofa beds, where I fell asleep for a while, before the masseuse came to get me. She gave me an hour of wonderful full-body massage.All in all, a great experience."

Bearing this in mind and previous comments I was a wee bit prepared for what to expect.We got the Hammam with the body scrub and mud rub which were great. We were in a room with warm marble and this was relaxing. Afterwards we had to shower and the staff were not shy about opening the front and back of my swimming trunks to pour small buckets of hot water down to help you clean. My girlfriend had bikini bottoms on which they were quick to take off before there was any chance to say no. So all this was a bit of a culture shock but going by previous comments it would seem to be standard.We then got a very relaxing hour full body massage which was good."

I was so excited to finally get an appointment at Les Bains de Marrakech, and it is truly a beautiful facility, the people there are very nice, but a massage ... they simply have no concept that it is meant for your muscles, not just your skin. I entered the beautiful entrance, was escorted to a lovely changing room, and laid down with some very hot mint tea to await my escort to the hammam. Very hot, very private, very nice. After I was taken upstairs to the massage area and even though I'd requested a masseur (not a masseuse) I was told there was only one ... I only needed one ... oh, well ... the woman was pleasant, but short and of quite small stature so there was no pressure in the massage. I'd looked up \"plus fort\" hoping that would help ... it didn't. After a monotonous hour of rubbing oil into my skin I stood up and left. The other odd thing is that you do not exit where you enter ... was I at my psychiatrists? ... no, you get the back alley treatment upon your finish ... there are much better hamams ... none as lovely ... but many better ... personally I'll be returning to Mille et Une Nuit ... not as nice, but a real massage ... if you care!"

This was a scrub, to be followed by a relaxing massage.The outside of the building is bland giving no indication of the luxury within. On arrival we were invited to change into swim suits and we lounged by the pool for a while before being called to our appointment. We were led through the labyrinth of gorgeously decorated rooms to a marble room with a wonderful scent in the air. We were told by the very brisk masseuse to shower and then we were left alone for several minutes! This was a bit unnerving to be honest as we didn't know if/when she was coming back! I think I would find it more relaxing a second time when I knew what to expect. However the masseuse did return, with another masseuse, and we were then both scrubbed to within an inch of our lives! We then had a mask put on and were again left for a while until told to shower.Following the scrub we were taken to one of the beautifully decorated relaxing areas and given mint tea before being taken upstairs to our massage which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I have visited several spas in the Uk and had several massage treatments but this was by far the best. The masseuse was clearly an expert. We were then led back to the relaxation area and given pastries and mint tea to round off our lovely morning in Les Bains de Marrakech."

The entrance is hidden down a long, tired looking, narrow alleyway but beyind the doors lies pure paradise.We were offered mint tea and a refreshing swim in the outdoor pool before the treatment began.We went as a group of 4; myself, my 2 female parents and my auntie and we had the hammam, 4 hands massage, body scrub, black soap rub and the all over body mud mask.We had our own treatment room which was effectively a steamroom, with box seating and waterproof cushion beds along two walls, and a smaller room through a narrow archway with one high massage bed, where the excellent 4 hands massage took place.We were given flip-flops and robes to wear and were informed by email, before arrival, to wear a bikini or a swimsuit. We were given lockers to put our valubles into.We were led down the softly lit corridors past several treatment rooms and massage beds, the place is like a huge Labyrinth, but it is stunning with drapes and stained glass light shades casting colorful mosaic patterns onto the ceiling and walls.Once we got to our room we were met by 3 women who did our treatment. They whipped off our robes. The next thing I knew, a woman behind me was undoing my bikini top and she then proceeded to whip down my bikini bottoms. At the same time my family were being undressed too. I told her that I wanted to keep my bikini on, but in French she said that we had to be naked. Being 19 I felt slightly embarrased at being shoved into a room and stripped naked, but that's how they do it so you've got to go with the flow. Being with my family made it less embarrasing as we were all in the same position.For the body scrub they used black soap, (available to buy in Les Bains but is much cheaper in the Souks) and a tough, exfoliating hand mitt (which we were given to keep after the treatment, they never use the same mitt twice for hygiene reasons). The black soap was incredibly aromatic, smelt like eucalptus and made my skin feel incredibly soothed and silky soft. The scrubbing was very forceful; firm but not painful, and took off the whole top layer of skin.The 4 hands massage was fantastic, but oh my they aren't shy and will not hestitate to pull your legs apart and throw buckets of water here, there and everywhere. I felt violated at the start but as I relaxed it was possibly the best massages I've ever had, lasting what felt like about 20 mins. In such a relaxed state of mind, it is difficult to keep track of who's hand is who's, I've never had 2 people massage me at the same time. You feel so relaxed you just sink into the massage bed and you feel like you're floating on a fluffy cloud. It sure was an experience. I would have another 4 hands massage and I definately recommend it.The mud mask was applied once we were lying down, the mud was slightly gritty to cleanse the pores but a smoother mud was applied to our faces. All of this took place in the steamroom so it got incredibly hot but the mud drew out all of the impurities and I felt like a new born baby when I left, so relaxed and so pampered, like there wasn't a care in the world (apart from being naked infront of my parents, haha).Due to religious reasons, women and men are not allowed to have treatment together if it has not been arranged in advance. When I was there one couple had been split up from their partners during the treatment, becasue they didn't specify a joint treatment upon booking. Les Bains seemed very organised to the point at times it felt a bit regimented whilst moving between treatment rooms, I think they were careful not to let women and men pass eachother in the corridors.After the treatment we were directed to a long room, lined with memory foam louners, with thin, silk, drapes between each one which can be tied back. We were given more mint tea and also little Moroccan delights consisting of small cakes and biscuits. Lovely. Relaxing music with chimes and drums played and scented mists were sprayed into the air.Not allowed to take pictures inside, so you'll just have to go and see for yourself.Stepping back out into the loud, busy, hustle and bustle of the main street of Marrakech after visiting Les Bains was like going from one world to another in the space of 5 paces. Incredible."

Les Bains de Marrakech is hidden at the entrance to Kasbah in a slightly dingy road but don't let that discourage you. It is a magical and wonderful place to visit.To put it into context I asked how many people work there and they told me 50, at any one time, to serve 15 customers per hour. And you feel pampered for it, led from corridor to corridor from person to person, gently coaxed from the pool to the hammam, to the massage and to relax with a smattering of water, mint tea and pastries in the middle.I went for the traditional hammam with massage at 550dhm which was an experience lasting 2.5 hours that would have cost hundreds of pounds in London. Not that I have experienced anything like it in London, for that matter. Scrubbed from head to toe with a black soap mask. Revitalized and left feeling fresh after an awful trip into down the night before.If you're feeling unsure if you should go here - don't. Take a petit taxi to the front door and be ready for it."

They are fairly prompt with email responses after the initial one, but took 5 days to respond to the initial internet booking (as you will see other comments mention). They request bookings to be secured via paypal deposit (in our case, 650 MD half of our total).It's in Bab Agnaou, south of Jemaa El Fna square, near the Kasbah Mosque. We ended up paying a kid to take us there, as google maps [BEWARE] has the location incorrect, and we spent a good hour looking 20 minutes walk north of it!!!No photography is allowed inside, which is a shame, but understandable. The place is very plush, with relaxation areas by the pool in outdoor courtyards, or inside where they spray fragrant water mist.To explain (as I didn't know how it worked, and they don't really explain), you go into separate male/female changing rooms, which have lockers for your personal items, changing into bathrobes provided. You need to wear either swimwear or underwear (and bring a change of underwear, dark coloured as they will get dirty with mud/oils).Some staff speak english, but likely the ones who treat you only speak french/morroccan. If you so wish, keep some money on you in your bath robes to tip the staff, as you won't find them again later. I had a duo hammam + massage the traditional one at 550 MD, whereas my wife had a facial and massage at 800 MD. We asked to have our massages together at the same time, but they were unable to accomodate. You will need to arrange this in advance as they don't think about these types of details.I had a burly woman who was very efficient and professional. My hammam was a sauna / scrub with loofah mitt / light body mask. I was scrubbed to within an inch of my life, and had layers of my skin lying on the bench when she was finshed. She wasn't shy to pull open the front and back of my boxers to pour water in to rinse me. My massage was amongst the best I've had worldwide, I like relaxing massages, and felt that I had a full hour rather than the usual rushed one.My wife said that hers tried to take her swimming bra top off, but didn't press when she refused. You are served tea after each treatment, and it's very relaxing. There are cheaper places for this kind of thing in Marrakech, but to be honest, it was fantastic and well worth it (especially when compared to UK prices)."

The reply was very quick within 24 hours, so I can only presume they have got their communication issues sorted out. The 2 hour experience was wonderful. A steamy, salt rub massage ending with a rose mud body mask. We did get the giggles when we first saw what each other looked like! The hour long full body massage that followed was delightful-the best massage I have ever had. There was plenty of time to relax in addition, on couches sipping tea.The environment was lovely,relaxing and calm just as a spa should be. I shall definately be going back-in fact it could be one of the main reasons for going back to Marrakech. note:one thing that did take a bit of getting used to was that I was naked and my husband kept his trunks on. However once I relaxed this did not matter.I would have this treatment again. my skin felt fabulous afterwards."

We started the day relaxing by the small pool and then went for our hammam body scrub which includes getting sloshed with warm water! After some mint tea we had our massages which were just heavenly and then some more mint tea and biscuits - we were there about 3 hrs and floated out afterwards.

Yes, the booking process was a bit hit and miss, but after e-mailing a few times after my initial on-line booking (4 weeks before) I finally got a confirmation. You can pay via PayPal which is useful.I took my mother for a birthday surprise and it was heavenly. We had all treatments together in couples which was really nice. First an hour of hammam and scrubbing (I've never been so smooth!), then an hour floating in a bath of rose petals and orange oil, then an hour full body massage (even your ears and hair get massaged!). Every treatment was followed by a relax in a lovely chill out area with mint tea and biscuits for the last one. We were able to use the outdoor pool for 30 mins after too which topped it all off nicely.The staff were very professional. A well run establishement. Yes - be aware ladies that you will be asked to remove your top for the whole duration (you wear a robe in between treatments). My mother was asked to remove everything but didn't seem to mind!- maybe because her bikini bottoms were shorts, who knows! They are not shy about scrubbing you everywhere and rinsing you off in the shower afterwards!We all left there feeling wonderful and the boys also thoroughly enjoyed themselves, having never been to a spa before (and probably thinking it was a bit of a girly thing to do!). Book well in advance and enjoy! Our day spa cost 80 Euro each, which is what you would pay for a massage alone in the UK."

We never felt rushed - ended up staying a total of 3.5 hours. You really are made to feel like royalty!The only criticism was the booking process - I'd actually given up on getting us a spot for a duo relax day spa (so not the cheapest of treatments, either!) I'd emailed twice 2.5 weeks before, no reply, no reply to my follow up enquiry. Two days before, I received a booking confirmation! It seemed to suggest from the email below that they'd replied 2 days after I'd sent original booking.. hmmm... I've had this a few times in Morocco now, where emails don't get through.

I paid attention to the fact that I needed to make my appointment early so I tried to book 2 weeks in advance. That turned out to be a good thing since it took 2 weeks to get a responds for my appointment ! I really don't understand why it took so long. I e-mailed and called several times and got nothing. It was always call back or you should get an e-mail today and I wouldn't get an e-mail. So whoever is in charge of making appointments needs a fire lit under their behind ! This Spa is much to classy for such bad customer service before you even arrive.On a better note...as I said it was worth the hassle of the appointment. My husband and I have been to many spas and this one is right up there with the best. It's so beautiful inside and I found the staff to be very nice. I got `The Traditional One'. I loved the Hammam & traditional body scrub. Lots of people wrote about having an open mind which was a nice warning but I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. I guess for Americans ...women anyway we are used to being covered up top but as long as you know before you go....no biggie. Yes the woman helped my out of my top but she was really nice there was no snatching as others wrote. Yes they will move your swimsuit bottoms around but the purpose it to get you clean as much as possible. Remember this is a Muslim country and being clean is a part of their culture so they take it seriously and it's a little different but a neat experience.  My massage was just ok but the facial was the best I've ever received. The lady was very nice. I don't know what the products are they used but the were awesome. My face never felt so good. I was so disappointed that I couldn't buy them on the way out. The Spa owner was greeting people as we left and he said that they will soon start selling the products on the Internet. The Spa owner was very nice by the way. He was very gracious toward my husband and I and was greeting people in the hall to make sure that they were enjoying themselves. The one tip that I read here and will give a nod to is the fact that you should take your tip money with you and carry it in your rob. You will have a different person for each service so be prepared for that money wise. I don't think they are used to people doing this. The look on the lady's face who gave me the scrub down was priceless when I gave her a tip. It was greatly appreciated and the way that you move from one place to another there it would be hard to go back and find your person afterwards. The Spa is quite big and by the time you are done your person maybe in the middle of servicing another person. Overall, this was an awesome experience ! The prices are cheap for all that you get and the amount of time that you spend there which make it even more appealing. It is a beautiful place and the owner should be proud. I would say go for sure and enjoy !"

NO! So I even tipped her.The massage was ok, nothing to write home about though, just a relaxing massage though I figured I'd have a stronger massage that is why I asked for a male masseur anyway.What makes this a great experience is really the ambiance, the decor, the mood, the music, the candles... it matches the Thai 5 star resorts' spas minus the subservience of the workers.I didn't really get any attitude from all the reception girls and hostesses and it's not because I speak French since I saw them being as nice to English speaking people."

My spouse and I booked the 'Relaxation' couples package for our last day in Marrakech and though we were able to get an appointment for a mere 4 days later, it's recommended that you book at least 2 weeks in advance so as not to be disappointed. We were asked to come a minimum of 20 minutes before our appointment time but told we could come in much earlier if we wanted to take advantage of their pool and other facilities. Had we not been strapped for time, we most certainly would have done so as the pool was lovely!FYI, This is not a traditional hammam but close in experience for the tourist who wants to be pampered. On second thought, pampered may not be the right word. This is definitely not for the modest individual as you will be scrubbed and washed in the same no-nonsense way your mother washed you when you were 5 years old!Here's what to expect:When we arrived, were were taken to separate change rooms, given white robes and slippers/flip-flops then instructed to enjoy the room as we would be collected in a few minutes.We were brought together, taken to the relaxation area and given hot mint tea to begin the relaxation process. We were then taken to our private hammam room where we disrobed (only our underpants remained), and lay on the white 'leather' and stone beds. We were doused with pails of water (an incredible feeling!) and left to steam for about 10 minutes to detoxify. The room became unbearable hot so I simply opened the door a crack. When the gal in charge of us returned and saw that the door had been opened a bit, she became deeply concerned about our comfort and kept checking that we were fine with the temperature. Once satisfied that we were ok, she applied the the black soap gommage (instructing us to roll over/sit up) then left us again to allow it to work its magic. Once again we were doused with pails of water, then the scrubbing began! She unwrapped a new 'loofa' glove for each of us, then proceeded to scrub (almost all) our nooks and crannies. She was not as 'familiar' with my spouse... his underwear were only slightly adjusted for the wash but don't be nervous or shy here... just enjoy it. It's done with professional detachment.. arms raised and lowered, ears scrubbed clean.Next came an herb body mask, more steaming, then another douse and shower (in the same room) to wash hair and rinse off any remaining soap.Once we were squeaky clean, we were assisted with our robes then led to a relaxation area where we lay on thick white terry covered lounge chairs and drank a refreshing combination of mint and cucumber juice.Soon we were collected again and taken to our massage room which was fragrant, candle lit and very romantic. An hour later, we were taken back to the relaxation room were we both agreed that our respective masseuses were the best we had ever had, and allowed to stay as long as we liked.This was one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had. My advice is too book this for the end of your trip and don't be shy or nervous. These women have seen countless naked bodies in all shapes and sizes. Remember that you're in Morocco and enjoy!"

I was wearing a swimsuit and said 'no, no, no' and she wasn't pushy - but it's a good idea to be aware that they do expect you to be topless for the Hammam, for facials and for massages.The Hamman was an interesting experience - the women who did it reminded me of gym instructors, kind of barking orders - my skin felt amazing afterwads, but I would have liked to have been told what was going to happen next.The massage was amazing, the spa therapist was very talented and I felt thoroughly relaxed. However after that, I was led into a room for my facial and told to lie face down on the bed. 5 minutes pased... 10 minutes passed... 15 mintues passed and noone came in. So I put my robe back on and wandered into the hallway to find someone - turns out they had forgotten or just not realised, so if I hadn't of been proactive, I would have been sat in there for ages.A woman came in and performed my facial but it felt so rushed - not only that, a bright light was put on at times and other spa people were just walking into the room to wash things. I've been to a few Spas in other places and it's never been the case - it was very hard to relax, not knowing when this bright light would be put on, or when someone would walk into the room.My face felt lovely afterwards and none of the women were horrible, but my tips would be:#1 Bring your own robe or sandals if you are a curvy lady or don't have small feet#2 Be able to say politely 'no' when they try (and they will try) to pull off your swimming costume if you aren't happy being topless#3 Check when you are led into different rooms what is happening next I'm glad we went, however I'd not book a package next time, just a massage and would bring my own robe."

We left feeling very refreshed.Highly recomended."

First we were led into a little dark room by a young women, who told me to take my bikini top off. when I said no, she insisted, so off it came!! My sister was instructed to roll down her swimming costume and again had no say in the matter!The hammam itself was not as hot as we expected, it was more warm and damp, so we lay down and the lady poured warm water over us, and then left for 10 mins- very strange! then 2 girls came in a rubbed the black soup all over us both, and then left again for 10 mins. Finally another girl came in and rubbed us VERY hard all over with a thick loofah glove, my bikini bottoms were pulled down by her in order to do this so felt a bit intrusive but again had no say in the matter!!! but then we were instructed to shower, and then led in our robes into a very calm room where we were served mint tea and lay down for 20mins. We then had an amazing massage each, which lasted a full hour and massaged my toes all the way to my head and ears-- really very good and nice and firm which is what i like, and very oily too.Overall, it is NOT the same as a relaxing UK spa experience, but thats because youre in MOROCCO (duh) so dont expect it to be something that it isn't--- it is a traditional way of washing and getting yourself really clean!! but i definately recommend the masage after, which ended things nicely. Definately worth going for the experience, as long as you are not self consious about your body!!!"

            "review": "Great experince for the tourist. Please note that this is an experience and should not be taken too seriously has a place to get an authentic Hammam. Saying that I had an excellent expereince and felt super afterwards.I had never been to a spa before but I wanted to try a Hammam so dragged my g/f along. The advantage of this place is that there are private rooms for your Hammam and the two of you can have the experince togther as tradional hammams are single sex places. The actual building itself is beautiful inside. It really relaxes you from the moment you walk in. You walk in and they tell you exactly what to do and where to go. The girls that give the hammam are very professional and respectful. However I didnt feel they were very thorough and felt they were just going through the different stages rather than actually doing each stage really well.They do leave the door open sometimes and the place does lose some minor heat and you do get people pottering in and out. At the end they take you too a nice room and they give you some tea and just leave you in there. So I wasnt sure if that was the end of the process and what we should do next.When we booked we were unable to get the treatment we wanted. The mask wasnt very through as they left vast chuncks of my body uncovered and when she did the loofah- leaving even bigger parts unscrubbed.The main woman at the desk is a bit snotty and I felt she only wanted to sell us what she wanted rather than what we wanted. There was no problem with the credit card payment.Overall the building and the different stages leave you calm ,relaxed and feeling ultra clean. If you want the experience I would reccommend. If you want something more authentic and less polished I would defintley shop around."

We noticed that it was really busy and felt we had to try it. What a terrible disappointment. The staff were unfriendly, did not explain what was going on and treated us as if we were on a production line. They provide nice slippers, great environment but dreadful service. We were shown into a small hammam which was fine but nothing was explained to us. We got very hot and eventually someone rurned up and gave me a quick all over soap. She didn't soap my husband and we assumed she would come back. He never did get any of the black soap. A quick abraisive scrub followed this and a further 10 minutes in the hammam to complete our experience. We were given mint tea and the opportunity to relax before we left (this was the best bit). My husband complained to the receptionist about the poor quality of service and that he had not been provided with any soap. It was quite clear she did not believe him and she tried to contact the person responsible for us. She could not find them (I can't understand why in such a small place). Eventually we were given a small refund but no appology. If I were you I would look for somewhere else for a Hammam. It is not good here and it is certainly not an authentic experience."

            "review": "Glorious! Stunning! Amazing!!!. The owner of my Riad recommended and arranged my visit to Les Bains de Marrakech. This Hammam is usually booked up, so a reservation is highly recommended.This is the most beautiful place I have EVER seen. I don't usually go to spas, but I have seen the inside of one or two, and nothing compares to this. Just walking in the door, I was enveloped with the most glorious aromas imaginable, as well as breathtakingly beautiful surroundings.I had arranged a 3 hour treatment called the \"Relax Day Spa\" , which included a hammam scrub with black soap and body mask, a 25 minute soak in an \"oriental bath\", and a 1 hour massage.Here's what to expect. I was greeted at the front desk (the English is not very fluent), and then escorted to a dressing room. I was given a locker with a key that I could keep. I was told to strip down to my panties, and given a robe.The first stop was a lovely lounge area with relaxing day beds, beautiful lighting and soft music. Many people were drinking tea. This is a coed area. I didn't have time for tea because I was soon whisked off to my hammam scrub. If you haven't had one of these before, be warned, it's not a soft soothing experience. They literally scrub the skin off of you with a very abrasive mitt. I knew this and expected it, and actually liked it! But let me explain the entire process. I was taken to a steam room with about 4 beds, but I had the room to myself. I had my personal attendant. First I was left to soak up the steam for awhile. Then the woman came in and rubbed black soap all over me and I was left to relax again. If you don't like having your breasts touched, perhaps it's best to wear a bra, or a bikini top and bottom. The ladies will touch any part that is exposed.After awhile, the woman returned, and she started the scrubbing process. As I mentioned, I rather liked it, but it could come as a shock to anyone who hasn't had it before. Then you are allowed to take a shower and removed all the loose skin. After than, you are given a body and face mask and left to relax again. This is followed by a shower, in which the woman will help you, unless you tell her not to.I would suggest you carry tip money in the pocket of your robe (20 Durham's per person). I tipped at large at the end, but I felt kind of bad that I couldn't give the woman money right then. She did not ask for any or seem disappointed. I just wish I had thought ahead about it.The hammam scrub and steam is an exhilarating and exhausting procedure. I was then escorted by someone who seems to know my exact schedule, to an even more beautiful coed room with amazing lighting effects, soft music, and beautiful organza draperies. You can ask for tea or water. If you speak French, it is helpful. After awhile, I was retrieved by a woman who lead me to the most beautiful and luxurious sight I've ever seen. It was a private room covered in black tatelakt, floors, ceiling, walls, and tubs. There were two tubs side by side in the room in case you have a loved one with you, but since I was alone, just one was filled. The room took my breath away. It was dimly lit by candles. There were steps leading up to the tub and they were covered in candles and rose petals. The tub was filled with aromatic oils and millions of rose petals. It was glorious, and it was all for me!!!!I had a relaxing soak. I wanted to close my eyes, and enjoy it, but even more, I wanted to keep my eyes open and remember forever the beauty!!!After this, I was taken back to the first relaxing room again until it was time for my massage.I've never had a massage before, so I didn't know what to expect. This was more like a rubbing with oils, than a muscle massage, but it was good. It took place in a private room with soft music and candles and rose petals everywhere. The woman spent an hour, thoroughly rubbing oil into every part of my body. Once again, if there's a part you don't want touched, wear something over that area. The massage included my face and head.Once again, I wish I had tip money for the woman, but she didn't insinuate anything.After that, I was free to relax in the common room until I felt it was time to go.Payment was fast and easy and the whole thing only cost 800 Durham's (or $92.00). I defy you to find such royal treatment anywhere else in the world for that price.There is a general tip box into which you can place the tips if you so desire. No pressure.I can't recommend this place enough. It is worth a trip to Marrakesh in and of itself!"

            "review": "Don't believe all the criticism!. Having read many of the complaints on here, my girlfriend and I were a little bit hesitant to book, but took the plunge on the recommendation of two friends of ours who went there last year (and got engaged in the romantic duo bath too...!).We had an absolutely wonderful and relaxing day. That said, I can understand some of what people have said so far, so here are my tips to make your experience as good as ours was (it seems to be very important to know what you're in for before you go to avoid disappointment or misunderstandings!).1. If you can, get your Riad owner or hotel concierge to book. Paulo from our Riad (58 Blu) called a day ahead and they were more than happy to take a booking for us, from him. So we never experienced the forms, credit card booking problems etc. They may still exist, but if you book this way it is very easy.2. The ladies on reception must have moved on. Nothing was any trouble and they were very polite. They spoke very good English, though I will concede that it is probably easier once you are having your treatments if you do speak a little French - we conducted all of our dealings through my basic French and everything went smoothly.3. If two of you book they will put you through the treatments together, and will assume you are a couple - it seems that the \"Duo\" treatments are specifically meant for couples (though it doesn't specifically say so in their brochure). So don't go with your good mate unless you are missing the good old days of boarding school and like sharing cosy showers. If you do go as a \"platonic twosome\", just explain when you book and when you arrive - they will give you seperate rooms (we heard them offering this to others at reception).4. Don't expect a hard-going sports/Swedish massage - they don't do it here! We had the \"tonifiant\" massage with hot towels, which was plenty for us, though I can well imagine that the \"relaxing\" massage might be a bit lame.Overall, it was worth the money, very relaxing and we didn't feel rushed or herded through. Either things have improved markedly recently, or some who have gone there before us were just missing their Beverly Hills beauty salons and their private masseuses! If you want a nice relaxing day and a welcome break from the souks whilst in Marrakech, go here. If you want the height of luxury on Versace towels and all provided in your native language, wait till you're back home!"

            "review": "Great place to come to after a day in the souk!. This place is expensive. It caters only for tourists - and even after the exchange rate conversion, its definitley not a bargain. I'm sure there are cheaper places out there. Their booking system needs a revamp - you have to fill out a MS Word document with your credit card details, that they hold as security in case you cancel your booking without notice. There is a huge risk of this information being passed along without your knowledge, it is NOT a secure method! I sent my credit card details in a pdf form, with a clause saying that I only authorised them (and only them) to charge me if I dind't cancel my booking in time and was a no show - it seemed like a big hassle, and if they are really serious about doing business, they really should come up with something better! Having said that, we arrived - tired, stressed out from the harassment in the souqs and the chaotic traffic of Marrakesh - and this was the *best* experience we had in the city. For 2 blissful hours no one asked us for money or shouted at us or tried to scam us. Yes, we paid a fortune for it, but I still think it was worth it. We had the traditional black soap and scrub, sweating it out for 45 minutes in the hammam. They were quite careful and gentle with us, and one of the workers smiled constantly at us. After our soap and scrub we rinsed off, and then got dried off and were served mint tea while waiting for our massage. The main reason for coming here is that they allow mixed-gender baths and hammams - if you go to a traditional one, men and women are segregrated (naturally). We had requested the relaxing massage (there is also the option of a stimulating one, if you indicate you want it, when you book or when you get in at reception) and it was sheer bliss! The masseuse was very good, she seemed to know where not to exert force (I have a gummy toe) and where to be careful. I have had Malay, Thai and Turkish massages, and this one at Les Bains was the best so far. The receptionist was not overly friendly, but after all the \"friendliness\" we had endured all day, this was fine with us. She was professional, and there was no fuss about paying by credit card. Again, the prices are not cheap, and you can get cheaper elsewhere in Marrakesh (baths are aplenty!) but its a beautiful place, with candles and rose petals, metal cast ceilings and soft chiffon furnishings, so if you think its worth it, after the hustle and bustle, book something here. Just be careful how you send your card details over."

            "review": "Hideous experience. I was at Les Bains de Marrakech today with my sister (I'm her brother). We're both in our 40s. We'd booked a hammam, gommage and massage. First, after changing into bathrobes, we were kept waiting for 30 minutes without any explanation. Then we were taken into a lukewarm hammam by a surly woman with offensive body odour. Twice during the hammam another employee came in to chat with the woman, and on both occasions she left the door wide open, causing a freezing draft to blast into the room. She seemed genuinely surprised when I asked her to close the door. When the hammam was over, she invited my sister to take a shower, and told me to get in with her. I said I'd wait, but she said, no, it's a large shower. When I exited the hammam to enter the shower, I saw it was actually a tiny shower and that there is no way I could enter without being wedged in with my sister. Utterly bizarre.We then waited for our massage in a room with 4 other people, before we were all herded upstairs. I asked for a male masseur, they have just one, he's the sole male employee in the place. I told him I wanted a strong, deep massage to work my muscles. He proceeded to apply copious amounts of oil and rub me like a dog. I stopped him and again explained what I wanted, even demonstrating by massaging him, but again he started to stroke me like a dog. It was just awful. I told him to stop, and he simply left the room. Then a girl came in and acted as if she was going to continue where he had left off. I told her no. Then a manager came in with the original guy, I explained the problem to her, that the masseur just didn't seem to understand the concept of a massage. By this time I was so far from being relaxed that I told them to forget it. Downstairs in the mens changing room as I was pulling up my trousers, still naked from the waist up, two girls came in without even knocking and asked me again to relate the problem. The whole experience was surreal. Awful, amateurish, complete rip off. Avoid."

It is beautifully decorated and there's the most beautiful courtyard where you relax and take mint tea mid-treatment. Our visit had a number of glitches in it though: Firstly we were ushered into the wrong treatment room (embarrassment for the staff and the poor people whose hammam was interrupted). Then when we showered after our scrub treatment the staff had forgotten to give us towels to dry off with.We were left in the waiting room for so long (about half an hour) mid treatment that I wondered if we had been forgotten!The treatments themselves were ok, the hammam part was surprisingly hands off, (5 mins soaping, 5 mins scrubbing and 30 mins us lying there wondering what was going to happen next). The relaxing massage that I chose was nice but pretty superficial.Overall I was disappointed.My criticisms are:* It is comparatively very expensive.* It is so popular that you sort of get herded through with minimal personal attention. Next time I go back to Marrakech I will seek out somewhere cheaper (and there are dozens of hammams there) and more authentic, will a less commercial atmosphere and more attentive staff."

It makes for a very memorable half day, and although by Moroccan standards it's not that cheap, it's well worth the \u00a340 we spent for more than two hours of treatments. I'd whole heartedly recommend it!"

We had a private hammam room for the 3 of us and took turns to be scrubbed, splashed and covered in mud. It was great (though different from a Turkish hammam which is bubbles and cold water). A draining massage afterwards was delicious in a meat-pummelled kind of way and we were just left to have a snooze and sip mint too between and after. You could even take a book along and sit in the peace and tranquillity. Only negative comments were it was so hot you could not touch the marble walls and so crossing the floor was a toe hopping experience, and that there was a problem with the telephone line so our credit cards could not be processed, which meant an accompanied walk to the nearest cash machine 10 minutes away."

I wasn't really happy with this and queried it with the Spa but they said there was no other option.I left it a few weeks so that it was nearer the time of travel and then decided to send the details requested as I really wanted to go to the Spa.I sent the fax and then got email confirmation of my booking!We turned up at the Spa a few minutes from our booking and it was perfect from there on in!We booked the Kasbah Day Spa - 3hours of treatment for about \u00a350! We had a Hammam, Massage and then dual bath - all of which I would highly recommend.I have been to a few different Spas and treatments in this country but I honestly think Les Bains is the best!

This was one of the most luxurious spas we have visited and seemed as though we had walked into some kind of scene from Arabian Nights - billowing swathes of fabric on the high, sunlight-flooded courtyard, intimate rooms with soft, beautiful cushions everywhere.Our package started with a hammam which was the best treatment of the lot - we left with skin feeling softer and cleaner than we've ever experienced. Next we were led to a room with 2 bathtubs filled with scented water and rose petals, but we probably would have preferred some other treatment to this as it seemed a little daft to pay that much money to sit in a bath for awhile. Finally, we had an hour long full body massage which was excellent - you pick the style of massage as well as the kind of scented oil. The whole lot cost something like \u00a350 per person, which given that we were there for about 4 hours in total and drank our body weight in mint tea and bottled water, seemed like excellent value. A very professional place that is absolute luxury - highly recommended!"

It was a highlight of my trip to Marrakech. The staff was incredibly warm, friendly and hospitable, making sure my friends and I were well taken care of. They would allow us to wait for each other to finish with our services and bring us mint tea/cookies and help us to wind down and relax. Once you walk into the spa, you feel like you are whisked away into a tranquil oasis in Marrakech, from the smell, lights and overall ambience. The waxing done at the spa is top notch and my hair did not grow back for quite awhile. The mani/pedi service is also top notch for the prep work done to nails, but the spa does have limited colors in polishes and no fans to dry your nails. The actual hamam packages and the transformation of the smoothness of your skin is incredible. I did the hamam about once a week and my skin still thanks me for it. Come with time on your hands, as there is no rush to leave and the staff is incredibly accommodating."

Luckily we found another taxi who took us nearer the location (which couldn't be reached by road) and gave us directions for the last part of our journey which we had to make on foot. Of course this is not the fault of the hammam but I notice that others will (for a charge) have a member of staff/taxi meet you at the main square ahead of your appointment as they acknowledge how tricky it can be for a foreigner to find their way around. I would have really appreciated that or at least a warning about the lack of road access when I had called up to book. I would return, but only if I went with a known, trusted taxi driver."

The place is very clean, friendly and calm. We were glad to get a 10% discount that comes with any two people booking the same combo treatment. We dropped in without booking ahead. The experience lasted 2 hours in total. Despite the spa due to close at 5.30pm, given the time we dropped in, the spa kindly extended their opening hours for us. We really appreciated this given it was our last chance to have the spa treatment before heading back home. I have to emphasise that the massage was to die for! I've had various in the past but this was second to none. The masseuse applied the perfect amount of pressure and attended to all over the body without missing a spot.

I didn't book an appointment so we were told to wait 30minutes. I don't know how long we were waiting because it didn't feel that long. We were given robes and sat in a room which was just so beautiful! We were then given tea and biscuits, again by another lady who was soooooo friendly and polite. We were then taken in to start the hammam and were scrubbed by two women who I wish I got their names to recommend them! They were so good and so friendly! My skin felt like a baby's bottom! We were then dried and given the robes again to wear and wait in the room again, where we were given more tea and biscuits (different ones). We were then taken in to have a massage and I swear it was so relaxing that I fell asleep! Me and my mother felt like new women!

We visited the spa for a massage as a way of relaxing and providing some respite from our day of haggling at the souks. We opted for the 1hr couples massage. The spa was empty and once changed, we were led to a room for mint tea. Typically, this is when the masseuse would explain the oils and asks for your preferences. Unfortunately, this didn't happen. We were quickly ushered into the massage room and it became apparent that there was some heavy building work going on directly on the other side of the wall. This ruined the initial 15 minutes of the massage, due to the persistent thudding. Eventually, one of the staff stopped, left the room, came back and suggested that we move rooms, which we readily accepted, although this should have happen far sooner, if not at the beginning. Instead of starting the massage again, it continued for the final 35 minutes in one of the ground floor rooms, which was a little disappointing as the disruption quite clearly affected the relaxation. Once finished, we changed and went to pay. Typically, this is where apologies might be offered, perhaps with a discount, which again, didn't happen. The massage itself was ok, although it did not relieve much tension as it was fairly light as there was no consultation.Compare this to our experience at the Heritage Spa around the corner (highly recommended) and Les Bains d'Orient certainly has some areas to work on.A little more focus on the customer experience next time please!"

I can't compare this to any other hammam/massage experiences in Marrakech as this was the only one that I tried but it would be hard to better the experience anywhere else. I'd had a jam-packed weekend and on the last day I went to one of the top rated spas to see if I could squeeze in a massage but they were fully booked, I'd done my \"trip advisor\" research at home and didn't have time to check out any more reviews so I took a gamble with Les Bains d'Orient, they were also fairly well booked up but managed to fit me in later in the afternooon. I had the gommage and massage - approx 1 hour 45 mins - it was a wonderful relaxing experience with a firm massage. The products used smelled gorgeous and there was a short break for mint tea on the roof terrace which was surrounded by green umbrella plants and was delightful. I felt totally pampered. You are given the option of whether to have your face scrubbed and whether to have your hair done, I went for both and didn't regret it. I was staying in a riad a few doors down the street so it was ideal for me to wander back and retain that relaxed feeling. When my hair dried it did have a slightly greasy/oily look about it so bear this in mind if you aren't lucky enough to have glossy hair and are planning to do anything special afterwards. There was a toilet and shower in the changing room so those who don't want to keep the oils on can wash them off before leaving, I waited a few hours and then shampooed my hair before flying home and if I'd planned things better I would have picked a time when I had absolutely nothing to do for hours afterwards. When I walked around the souks I had dozens of people offering me hammam experiences and thrusting leaflets at me so I had the impression that it would be easy to walk in off the street to any spa and get a treatment - how wrong I was. If you want to have a luxury experience at one of the best rated spas then my advice would be to try and book in advance."

We spent a wonderful couple of hours having one of the packages including massages and left floating on air. This is definitely an establishment with high standards of cleanliness and service. It was my friends first experience of such treatments and she loved it. My only criticism is that the changing room was rather cramped when more than two were in there. Thank you for a wonderfully relaxing afternoon."

The staff were warm and friendly and very experienced in their field of work. We walked away floating on air.........Many many thanks"

Wonderful staff accommodated us and made us feel most welcome. Wonderful 'couple' Hamman with loofa black soap scrub if you can stand it, or herb scrub if you can't. Followed by unquestionably the best (and unusual) Moroccan massage (again as a couple in the same room with two masseurs). This stylish place, set in a converted Riad offers fantastic, luxurious, relaxing experience. And a 10% discount for two off the Package price made the two hours there absolutely brilliant value at 1080MAD for two people. We are going again tomorrow!!"

We booked the Reve d'Orient package, which included the black soap scrub and rhassoul clay and a massage that was very relaxing and added a facial which included extraction and hydration. My travel mate, a guy, also got the same and we both felt like jelly afterwards - we were glowing! Both of us purchased their amazing massage oil in the Fleur d' Orange scent. A really great way to spend 3 hours! We booked later in the day and then went out for dinner - took away all the stress of the medina madness!"

I enjoy spa services, but cannot afford to go as often as I would like in the U.S. For less than $100 U.S., including tip, I was able to get a massage, Hammam, manicure, Cleopatra milk bath (with rose petals), and facial with scalp massage. My partner does not usually like spas, but appreciated his leg and foot massage so much that he got additional foot-rub services - still only brought our total cost to $140 U.S. including tip.The service included showers afterward for those that prefer, and also included disposable undergarments among the usual towels, slippers, and robes. The entire building was beautiful and the atmosphere was very serene. In between services we were able to relax on the rooftop terrace, drinking tea, and reclining in the sun or shade, as preferred. There were also indoor rooms for lounging in between services, if preferred.My services took considerably longer, but my partner was able to relax and lounge on the terrace until I was done, enjoying more tea and complimentary Wifi. At the end, we were able to pay with our Chase bank, American Visa card as promised - this is important to note, as many places advertise the ability to pay with Visa, but then are unable to process American cards.I would highly recommend this spa for any service - the cleanliness of the facilities, and professionalism of the staff, were unsurpassed by any of my experiences thus far."

Actually It was my first experience with Spas and i never expectel to be better than this one. Although I went on the morning of the day without a past reservation, they welcomed me and we set a time after 5 hours on the same day and I really appreciated this. When I came back they showed me my locker and stuff and I began with Moroccan Hammam, a very clean one. Then they took me to have a rest with the Moroccan tea and some sweet and they asked me if I want massage now or the jakozi so I let them decide for me and they picked massage first, and it was really a great choice. I started with the massage and it was realy very cosy and awesome! After that I had the jakozi and it was a great end of the day. I spent 2 hrs and half for 600 dirham. They offer me a free jakozi on the package. I really recommend this spa to everyone and I will go again and again everytime I will be in Morocco! Thank u Les Bains d'orient."

The first hour was filled with a body pealing from top to toe. We had never thought we would carry so much dead skin with us around. This was done in the hamam. The second hour we were deliverd a message that made us feel every single muscle in our bodies. Not only the kindliness of the staff but also their application really was impressive. We even thought of coming to Marakech back again just for this place. What is more.

It is well known that the medina is full of constant noise and excitement, however once you step into Les Bains D'Orient, it's as if you've transported to another place! My husband and I were warmly greeted with smiles and were immediately accommodated even though we were quite early. We were escorted to the rooftop terrace where we were served mint tea and cookies. My husband decided not to have any service done however he was very relaxed on the rooftop with his tea and sweets. I was then led to a beautiful changing room and given a plush robe and slippers to change into. The attendant sprinkled some lovely orange blossom water in my hand and massaged my feet all before the Hammam and massage started. Everything was perfect and I felt relaxed and comfortable from start to finish. It was my first Hammam experience and it will not be my last. The milk bath with rose petals, the manicure, the face massage, perfect!! I can go on but you catch my drift. I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and will certainly return.The place is very easy to find as there are clear signs on door and wall of the building. Very clean and fragrant. Well dressed and well mannered attendants. The attendants speak more French than English however, we had no problems understanding each other! Just a wonderful first time experience worth every penny."

I was so excited to have a relaxing experience at this spa - especially after all the reviews and recommendations. They were also kind enough to acommodate me even though initially they were full - which I thought was a good sign. Things started off well with tea in relaxation room. Then came the massage (I had a Moroccan massage). I have had so many massages in my life in various countries but this was truly the worst one. It was the first time I had to walk out of one before it was finished - and I really have quietly sat through some mediocre massages in my time. The masseuse simply had no focus or technique and my back felt almost broken at the end of it (this was not due to excessive pressure but simply SUPER bad technique). Her head massage was so bad that my hair was like a crow's nest at the end. Needless to say, it was pretty traumatising and I had to ask her to stop. I really don't know know what to say as I have never had to complain about a massage before and the manager was very sweet about it but didn't offer any compensation/reduction in price - truth be said, I did not ask for anything as I just paid and left. This was something that other people asked me when they heard about my experience. I guess I was just traumatised as I have never had to complain about a massage before, to actually make a scene about payment. Maybe it was just a one off, maybe they were full and hired someone on the spot to accomodate me. Who knows. The good reviews show that they must be doing something right and maybe I was unlucky to get someone on a bad day. Regardless, I won't be going back during my next time in Marrakech."

The walls were built to a perfect height which meant you couldn't see any of the surrounding buildings - only glorious blue sky. We were way relaxed before our treatment even started. The facilities are EXCELLENT, modern, clean, extremely well thought out, pure luxury. Despite the fact they were fully booked, the way everything is organised, you feel as though you have the whole place to yourself. The hammam and massage were both absolutely amazing and staff couldn't do enough to make sure we were well looked after. Changing facilities and the gorgeous rain shower were also pristine.

After that, we received a (in our case toning) massage from two other female staff members. I would certainly recommend going to this hammam. It offers great value, the rates are very reasonable, and it was just a great feeling to find such a nice and clean place in the city, where we could really relax.

I would like most- go to the number 1 spa but after some experience of trying out the number 1s and coming out disappointed I thought I would check others out. This particular spa stood out for me as everyone who had visited had given it excellent and also as it is relatively new you know that the service will be to impress. I wasn't wrong this place I have to say is just amazing... I Have been to many spas across the world and even in London but this (for the money I paid )was totally totally worth every single minute.The staff are lovely and genuinely want to make sure you have an experience to remember. Both my husband and I went for a package of 40 mins hamam and 1 hour massage.The lady who does the hamam is superwoman .. And just the sweetest person ever who made sure you were ok the whole time. The exfoliating is hard work But wow does my skin feel great, smooth and I think with all her scrubbing more toned! Once the hamam was over she gave me a hug and said so lovely to meet you.. Just too sweet and so genuine it made me smile.. The massage... Oh boy... These women are super women .. I'm feeling so relaxed now after the pochon massage I don't want to move! They are experts at this and really know how to massage every muscle in your body! Overall 5 out of 5 for this place and I don't give that to everyone as I'm quite fussy.. Try it..and be prepared to come out feeling a new person.. I'm coming back next year For sure"

Having heard much about Moroccan hammers / spa experiences I was keen to try out a more luxurious experience than the more traditional / local one, and this one at Bains D'Orient didn't disappoint. The two hour session included a wonderful scrub / clay treatment, followed by a massage by Khadiya, who I think must have magic hands as the full body massage was simply divine - and I came away floating. Certainly the best spa / massage experience I have ever had!"

It was pristine, so clean and smelt wonderful and was clearly an oasis of tranquility for anyone venturing inside.

This is a brand new facility, and like a Riad totally hidden from the outside but light and tastefully decorated on the inside.

Beforehand we were led to separate changing areas for men and women, with lockers, toilet and shower where we changed into bathrobes and slippers. Then we were led to another area with loungers where we were offered mint tea whilst our feet were wiped clean of the street dust and briefly massaged. A really thoughtful gesture. Then we were taken to the couples treatment room. I had a face, neck and head massage, my husband a leg and foot massage. Both were done very well on comfortable massage beds in a dimmed atmosphere with thankfully no massage music!After this we were taken to another recovery area on the roof we sat on sun loungers sipping more mint tea with biscuit. We could have used the jacuzzi for a few more dinars.They have a comprehensive menu of different treatments available as well as the traditional hammams with natural products. They also speak English and their website is available in English.Altogether excellent value for money. Going again later this week!"

As a qualified swedish masseuse and having gone to many places before and having had many massages I don't think this place is the best for an amazing experience. The staff could do with showing more interest and explaining in advance what is going to happen. like they leave the room after the massage without saying anything, you are left there not knowing to expect. The bath after the hammam experience is far too cold, i know it's meant to be cooling but not shivering. no idea where the jaccuzi is and if it works...not even mentioned to us as it's optional i have no idea if it even exists. I ordered the tonic massage as I have many aches in my body and didn't want a relaxing massage...I was told it was more expensive because of the use of hot towels...these were not used, when i mentioned this to my masseur afterwards he just dismissed it as if this didn't exist...so why pay more for same treatment but just a bit more pressure. talking of which...i had to ask for more pressure, the masseur replied, i am applying the oil at the moment...it doesn't take so long to apply oil on someone's back. The masseur didn't massage me around my shoulder blades which is where i needed it the most. Also, before any treatment, the staff should ask if there are any contraindications, injuries and so on...nothing was done so. the massage to the face was poor and hardly no neck massage. The leg section was awesome. being French I would have hoped that communication would flow more but it didn't. There is a serious lack of motivation from the staff. Before the hammam traditional treatment, there is a plaque explaining the session but didn't hae time to read it...then the staff proceded on \"giving me very simple orders\" go on back, front,,,,and not much explained...like next we are going to do this and that. The worst part is that after the bath, you put on your robe which then gets wet, then you are taken to a room to relax with fans on...such a cold experience...i was freezing, then after your massage, you get to put on the same robe again which is wet through...new robes should be provided then as we were so cold. Tea is served but it would be nice to be able to help ourselves freely to more drinks. Drinking is so essential during massage treatments...this should be reminded to clients too! I won't go back again as I think the price is far too high for the experience offered. shame!"

It was not relaxing but quite stressful as we didn't know how long we were going to locked in the hot sauna before they would come back, massage was supposed to go for an hour in the package but only went for 45 min , we had to wait around for ages in between treatments and didn't know how long until they were back so it wasn't very relaxing. We asked for water after spending ages in the sauna, this seemed like a major inconvenience to them and they told us we would have to wait till they could get it , about 15 min later and we were so Thirsty after sauna.

I was looking for somewhere which offered a proper hammam treatment but my boyfriend was somewhat nervous so we chose to come here as we could have our treatments together (although in the end he decided to have a simple 'Relaxing massage' and skip the hammam). The staff are very friendly and make sure you know what they are doing, without being overly chatty to stop you from being able to just relax and enjoy the experience. The hammam facility in the basement is lovely, with a number of treatment rooms and a plunge pool to use following the treatment. The younf woman who treated me was charming, and the whole experience was lovely - I felt invigorated and refreshed, but not scrubbed to within an inch of my life (which was my experience from a Turkish hammam a few years ago!).The massage rooms are on the ground floor, adjacent to a relaxation room, where my boyfriend rested while I had my hammam treatment. Our massages were done in the same room - his by a masseur and mine a masseuse. We both had 'Relaxing' massages - he said his was very nice, and he certianly had no difficulty falling asleep in the relaxation room afterwards. I wasn't so sold on my massage - the nicest thing about it was that it meant I had oils rubbed into my skin after my hammam. There was nothing wrong with the massage technique as far as it went - I regularly go for deep tissue massages at home so I suppose I'd thought this would be the same, but it was much lighter touch.All in all I'd happily recommend Le Bain Bleu for those people wanting to have a hammam but in a place which is more on the side of a spa than a public bath."

For 40 minutes out of the 45 minutes I had 3 masks applied to my skin and left alone in a room. As a trained beauty therapist I do not recognize this as a 'facial' but would only describe it as product appliance!At the end of the treatment I told the so called therapist of the spa and the spa manager that I was not happy with the treatment or lack of it!!!The body massage however was excellent.At the reception I agreed to pay for the body massage but was certainly not paying for the 'product appliance treatment' as I booked in for a facial which involves a facial massage and a consultation prior to the treatment . Neither of these happened.I was told I had to pay and the owner of the Riad I was staying in should have advised me that this was the 'Morrocan way' of having a facial. what non-sense. Why would the owner of a Riad tell me what to expect in their spa facility. I then asked to speak to the Manager not the receptionist to discuss my complaint further and was told that they were 'busy' and could not meet me. I still refused payment until I could speak with someone who had the relevant customer service skills to deal with my complaint and said I was around the corner in the Riad when the Manager was not busy to meet me. The receptionist said I could not leave as this would cause a problem for him (apparently staff are sacked if they don't collect payment ) so the 2 security guards outside 'locked me in the reception' until I paidPOOR SERVICE, AGRESSION AND INTIMIDATION AT IT'S BEST.

You can receive better massages in cheaper spas or similar priced spas such as Adam park spa hotel without the rudeness, poor customer service and cockroaches we experienced here!!!We arrived on our final day to receive the treatments which were supposed to be 1hr25, but took 2hr30m. We were left unattended for approx. 40mins in a bath of scented water (falsely advertised jacuzzi), which had cockroaches on the bath top! We were also offered tea from a tea tray that had ants on it! My friend & I booked Le Bain Bleu two days in advance for our last day. We were interested in a simple massage (approx.350DH), but enquired about the possibility of having a massage in the same room and were shown the price list (in French, which we do not speak). We were told the price for a double room massage and a chance to use the jacuzzi was 700 which we deemed as reasonable. The receptionist who spoke little/bad English neglected to inform us that the price was per person!Once we had our treatments on our last day we were shocked to find out that we had been incorrectly informed of the price! This was obviously a misunderstanding due to the language barrier but all the staff proceeded to insist that we were to blame and should have known better. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.The receptionist who had told us the price two days before even tried to deny he had ever seen us!As it was our last day and we were flying out in the next few hours we were out of money, but allowed a member of staff to follow us with their card machine, to our hotel to try and use a card to pay. The card machine was faulty and could not process the payment. We then went to try atm points (we tried 3), but my card would not allow me to withdraw abroad. Out of options, we apologised profusely even though we were not to blame. And tried to explain that had he not misunderstood our price enquiry and not mistakenly told us it was 700 we would have paid it all in full! The staff member who followed us to the hotel created an embarrassing scene in our hotel and called the police to our horror. The police came and understood our point! Our regular cab driver and hotel staff testified to the police that we have paid for many services! We would have never booked treatments without enough money. The staff member from Le Bain bleu was relentless and aggressive! Even after the police officers disagreed with him, asked him to accept responsibility, asked him to take the 700 we had and leave us alone, he would not! He followed us yet again to the airport!!!! And I tried once again to withdraw money to no avail. We were only able to be free of this aggression and harassment once we entered the airport and he could not enter! We are sure he would have caused another scene and possibly result in us missing our plane. A spa with such aggressive & rude members of staff with poor customer service does not deserve to be visited. We are also convinced that the member of staff may have deliberately deceived us regarding the cost just to get more money, which we unfortunately did not have! He repeatedly denied ever meeting or discussing the price with us!! If you would like to visit a spa with similar prices with kind staff in a beautiful space please try farnachi spa in the medina or Adam park spa hotel.We explained that we would be writing trip advisor reviews and the arrogant staff member did not bat an eye lid as he replied that he would reply and contest everything we had to say! Le bain bleu honestly ruined our trip, please do read all the bad as well as good reviews before deciding to visit, now I can see that what was said in those bad reviews was what we experienced and more!"

My parents also had an appointment for massage. Staff welcomed us graciously--we were several minutes late since we got lost in the medina. The staircase down to the bath and pool was unique and had a quaint feeling. Everyone and everything was very professional. Both the hamman and massage was wonderful. Comparing to another massage I received at Le Bains de Marrakech, the one at Le Bain Bleu was much better."

A not to miss in the to do list while in Marrakech. We loved the layout of le bain, the process and the after glow we saw and felt. This hamam was chosen while checking the Lonely planet for top hamam. Our group comprised of 9 ladies for the scrub; only 2 opted for the massage. Wonderful experience and comparison with Turkish bath will be unfair. These two are great experiences not to missed."

The facilities are clean, the rooms have ambience and the fullbody massage was really Relaxing. The Spa can be easily found by a short walk of ten minutes from Djemma El Fna by Little signs put along the way. If you have time before the treatment, you can take a drink on the rooftop terrace of the Riad which belongs to the Spa!"

Staff were very attentive - from reception to hammam ladies to the masseurs. One of the registration ladies saw that I didn't bring my swimwear, and might have to skip the jacuzzi. She dug up some disposable underwear to protect my modesty. So a tip - bring swimwear or just a spare set of undies. Women may go topless, but should wear undies. You start with a shower and soaping, before resting for 10 min for the skin to get warm. The subsequent scrubbing was less painful than I expected, and the hammam ladies were super friendly. If you are uncomfortable with the door left ajar, just ask them to close it. The warm stone bench and eucalyptus smell were just so comforting. The massage was gentle, yet it released all the tension in the body. Highly recommended."

We went into the hammam together and cast modesty and Britishness aside. We were washed and scrubbed and anointed with masks and washed again with scents including eucalyptus, rose, pine and (I think) verbena. Being a sucker for essential oils this was all heaven to me. The two ladies who were attending to us were friendly and talked just enough, for instance recognising that I wanted to know about the scents so therefore talking me through them. we went and relaxed in the jacuzzi, which was warm, rather than hot. After that we were escorted upstairs to our wordless and peaceful massage, which I found absolutely wonderful and curiously emotional. The it was just a time to relax and return slowly to reality with a glass of mint tea before we stepped out again into the souk. Heavenly."

Take your swimming costume, ladies preferably a bikini you will be topless for most of the treatment. I suggest the duo of the traditional hammam and massage experience. Treatments here are not relaxing; staff are incredibly loud, noisy and rushed but I guess this is somewhat authentic of the Moroccan hammam. If you are shy of nudity, this is not the place for you! Even though every room has a door, they are usually left wide open. You will have you breasts and butt exposed from time to time. After the 30 minute hammam you will be asked to put your bikini top on and have a 10 minute laze in the lukewarm jacuzzi with other guests. Then you will return to the \"relaxation room\" upstairs while staff hustle and bustle noisily to get the massage rooms ready. The one hour massage was okay, a lot of oiling and rubbing with an occasional massage technique. Throughout our experience staff were kind and friendly.Overall, a good tourist public hammam experience to be tried once."

Good price compared to other spas.Me and my girlfriends booked a traditional hamman and full body massage. They were very accommodating and managed to book 3 girls at last minute. Recommend going in the morning when it is less busy. Hamman involved being rubbed all over your body with creams and scrubs. Warning: You are expected to remove your bikini top and stay in just your underwear. The hamman felt a little rushed and they left you for 10-15 minutes at a time with treatment on your skin. The staff did not explain that they would leave you for periods of a time but there is a notice on the wall of the room explaining so. The hamman could be a little longer, however the full body scrub was very effective in removing all our dead skin! We were then allowed 15minutes in the Jacuzzi which was cold unfortunately so we did not stay in there for long! The full body massage afterwards was wonderful. The right amount of pressure was applied to all of my body from neck/shoulders all the way down to my feet and toes. We were allowed onto a relaxation bed afterwards with a bottle of water and Moroccan tea which was a nice touch- all included in the price.We were even allowed to take home our body scrub glove as a nice souvenier! Would definitely recommend!"

I was then taken down to the treatment area, in a room with a member of staff I was washed, had oil applied, exfoliated and a mask applied. This was all done whilst topless, not the norm for the Brits, but I just got on with it. My dignity was preserved and I had my robe when leaving the room. I choose not to use the jacuzzi although it looked lovely and instead was taken upstairs to another treatment room for a one hour massage. The lady giving the massage was excellent!

I had a packed itinerary in Morocco so I just said to myself to give it a go. I realised I would need a massage before I head back home just to loosen up my muscles and ease my back pain from all the walking. I read review after review here on TA about the different hamams and found Le Bain Bleu. There were a few reviews that were off but then I trusted my gut and booked my massage and hamam therapy here anyway....and I am glad I did!Upon reviews here on TA, I followed suit that one must come in very early to avoid the crowds. I booked with Gemma for a hamam and sports massage at 10am however when I came, they didn't have my booking at all. Luckily, they still had one slot left. If this booking process had been taken cared off, I would've given them 5 stars! The ladies who took care of me were very professional and made sure I was getting the treatment up to standard. I was all alone in the hamam area which was blissful! The staff speak only a few words of English but were very helpful and kind. The lady who did my sports massage was THE best. I'm not your typical soft-massage lady so I found it fantastic that she was able to deliver the amount of pressure I want! Take your time relaxing after your treatments. I actually had a whole pot of moroccan tea! Haha! I am also naturally a curious person and looked behind the curtains and saw that there was a riad attached to the spa. I will definitely book my next stay in this riad as it is well-located and BEAUTIFUL inside! ps. if you're going to Istanbul and want to know which hamams to avoid, write me a message or see my reviews!"

We recommend this hammam for anyone new to the concept who wants to try it, but is perhaps nervous about the grit and grime of a traditional hammam. They have developed a space that is atmospheric and attractive, with the basement containing the hot rooms and plunge pool, while the ground floor has relaxation beds and the reception and changing facilities. We opted for a Traditional Hammam package which included a hammam body scrub with black soap, Ghassoul body mask, footbath, and massage with argan oil. For those used to Western European spas, this is not the same, so shed your expectations. You will be scrubbed vigorously and hot water poured over you to rinse off the various treatments, while you lie or sit in the hot steam room. You will feel as if you are being pushed around a bit, but you need to relax into this. The rooms can be noisy as a result of the nature of the process. We found it relaxing, but those used to quiet spas might find it not so much!Speaking French or Arabic would help you - our masseuse spoke no English - but is not essential in my view.

We were treated like a king and queen. Hammam was so-so, don't expect too much.. It is not hot enough! Neither the Jacuzzi.. But it was still good!! The fact that there were not so many people there, it is a high plus point, no rush! The waiting room is one of the best part! It is so relaxing, just laying down in a nicely decorated room, with your mint tea and cake. We were super relaxed in the massage room. The product that they use is also great, the Argan oil, is not oily but sticky enough to be used for a massage. The masseur are very well experienced and did very well! The best part is that after the massage, the masseurs left us to relax for a bit. Overall it is a very nice experience!"

This was for the hammam, massage and to use the spa facilities at a cost of 600 mad.The whole experience was disappointing and not at all relaxing. There were so many people that we had to have our massage before the hammam as they had obviously overbooked. The spa itself was noisy and overcrowded and not particularly clean. We had to ask for water and were not offered refreshments at any time. The main areas had both men and women in attendance and it was quite noisy. We did not end up going in the jacuzzi as it was too busy and the staff were obviously wanting to get us out as soon as possible after the hammam.The staff do not speak English so it was difficult to know what was going on or what was happening next. The massage was not so bad although starting at the feet and ending with the face is not ideal. However the hammam was really, really dreadful. It was not pleasurable and felt like we were on a conveyer belt, being pushed and pulled about and at times it was verging on embarrassing. We all felt that the staff were just treating us as stupid tourists with no care or genuine level of service. Although we did not have any idea what to expect, this was not the experience we had anticipated having looked forward to a relaxing treat. None of our party are prudish however it was lucky that we all possess a sense of humour!I had a hammam at the Riad we were staying at a couple of days later which was totally different and an absolutely wonderful experience which made me understand what a traditional hammam should really be about.None of us would recommend Le Bain Bleu as a great experience. Do not go here."

But when we arrived we figured out the the level of English wasn't that good from anyone working in the spa. So by accident we ended up in the Hamam. Which was our first time so it took a while until we recognized the mistake. Unfortunately there were not enough employees to give two massages afterwards. It was really a little caos. Anyhow, the hot stone massage I received afterwards was amazing. The spa is clean and has a nice atmosphere. The employees are a bit noisy and the commandos a bit harsh. All together a special experience and fair prices (we did not have to pay for the Hamam treatment)"

The first Hammam spa we looked at was fully booked. Finally, after an hour, we stumbled upon Le Bain Bleu. My friend remembered it from some reviews she read and we were both a little skeptical but figured we'd try it anyway. We were both glad we did! Thankfully, they had open spots for us right there. We ordered a traditional Moroccan Hammam for only 200MAD (less than 20euro). This included a foot soak and a eucalyptus scrub. First we were brought into a changing room and given paper thongs, robes, slippers, and lockers for our things. We were to take off everything including our bras. Once we were changed we were brought into a private room with lounge chairs, a jacuzzi, and showers. We took off our robes and washed ourselves down. Then we were guided into an adjacent hot, stone room with stone benches. Some reviews include men being in the room with women and an uncomfortable atmosphere. I can assure you this was not the case. My friend and I, both women, were the only people in the stone room other than the female workers treating us. We each had our own girl working on us. First they threw warm water on us then washed our bodies everywhere. I mean EVERYWHERE. Thankfully, neither of us being awkward people were okay with this. However, some women might feel uncomfortable with this. After they left our feet to soak for about 10 minutes and left the room. When they arrived back they threw more water on us to take the soap off. They then scrub our bodies with some type of mitten. I have had body scrubs before at high end spas. This was by far the most effective scrub I have ever received. We were actually able to see all the dead skin that was scrubbed off, and I take very good care of my skin. They then washed us down again and we showered, washing our hair also.We were then brought to a cold jacuzzi which was a lot more refreshing than it sounds. We sat there for about 10 minutes just cooling off. We put our bathrobes back on and were led to a quite room with lounge chairs. A woman brought us water, delicious mint tea and biscotti buscuits. We were left to rest for as long as we wanted. All in all a wonderful and inexpensive experience for our first hammam and highly recommended!!"

The staff were always courteous and attentive. There is ample time to relax and let your cares melt away. I felt the facility was clean and kept up. The massage was wonderful and the staff very attentive. I would definitely go for a return visit. For my first hammam experience, I feel like labeling this establishment as catering to 'tourists' not a bad label in fact I am glad it was more un-traditional."

While some people on tripadvisor have complained this place caters to tourists I don't see this as a bad thing - after all we are tourists. We opted for the full experience of the hammam, massage, facial and pedicure. The entire experience was wonderful. We are treated well, privacy was respected (I was covered with a towel since other visitors were in the jacuzzi). The whole experience lasted about 4 hours. I did see the areas cleaned for other patrons. While everything wasn't scrubbed to creation with bleach like you'd find in the western countries, it was definitely adequate and I felt comfortable being there."

I traveled to Morocco with my sister and wanted her to experience the same traditional bath and ritual I fell in love with. We choose this place since it received high recommendations from Lonely Travel guide book.The place is nice but being associated with hotel it caters to its guests which means that you will encounter presence of men which is not acceptable in traditional hammam. I am not a prude but 6 noisy Dutch men in jacuzzi bath playing bowling with water bottles who wandered into our hammam room where we are basically naked is hardly relaxing experience. The whole hammam procedure consisted of 40 minutes of being laying on marble slab and 4 minutes of scrubbing rinsing included. Don't get me wrong, place is nice but it is far from traditional hammam where I was scrubbed to no end by 2 women, rinsed, bathed, my hair was washed, all in absolutely quiet and calm atmosphere. If you are looking for something more traditional, I am afraid this is not a place."

While we spoke English, the hammam staff, who spoke French and Arabic did their best to communicate with us. We were treated very well here, and the 'Traditional' service along with a massage was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who is going to a hammam for the first time. Very relaxing and very Spa-like. Be sure to bring extra cash for your massage and your hammam attendant. They deserve it!"

I chose to have the full Grand Bleu Relax, which comprised a scrub, relaxing bath, jacuzzi, full body massage, full facial and finished off with a pedicure.

            "review": "Warning Travelers. **Warning Travelers**Here is what you, the Traveler, need to know about Le Bain Bleu. This spa is disrespectful, unprofessional, and unhygienic and not the place you want to go to experience a real Moroccan hamam. My husband has worked in research and development for the Spa industry for 10 years and in the massage field for 20 years providing education, instruction and providing services for professional sport teams. Thus you can trust, regardless of any reply from this \u201cspa\u201d, that this is not a case of a finicky or temperamental tourist who didn\u2019t like their massage and service but a precise and accurate account of what you will be confronting if you go to this unprofessional, unhygienic and seriously disrespectful attempt at creating a spa experience for tourists in Marrakech.Here are the highlights, 1. Dirty Sandals, black with grime2. The hamam was lukewarm.3. The bowls that they used to wash the feet were obviously not cleaned as they soaked our feet in them, splashed the bench where we were laying down and just put them back in the corner.4. The pillows to rest your head were reused for several patronsAll of this increases the chance for cross infection.5. The services provided in the hamam would last a total of 2-3 minutes before the women left. It was hurried, not relaxing, and was definitely under par for any spa.No direction or communication of what to expect or do, if you have never experienced a Traditional Moroccan HamamNo indication that I, who obviously showed up with no bathing suit and was told that they would have something for me to wear at the Spa, would only be provided a paper g-string and had to wear a lace see through bra which was removed during the treatment numerous times during the hamam and the JacuzziLeaving the hamam door open while other patrons/men showered and leaving me exposed to men while we were escorted to the Jacuzzi pool, regardless of the fact that my husband demanded they give me a pair of the men\u2019s shorts and his numerous requests that they cover me up. He had to stand in front of me and shield me from view in the shower and sit in front of me in the Jacuzzi to give me some dignity more than once as the women who provided services made no attempt to help.I was told to walk topless to the Jacuzzi while another other couple in the pool uncomfortably looked away but were also showing more respect for me than the spa staff could muster as I was obviously in a very uncomfortable and DISRESPECTFUL SITUATION. The oil massage started at the feet and ended up finishing with a generous lathering of the oil from the feet and body all over our faces and hair. In massage 101 they teach never to massage from the feet up because it leaves the client irritated and unable to relax as it pushes all the energy up to the head.Regardless of the numerous attempts to indicate to cover me up during the massage we were put in the same room and as my husband insisted my chest be covered with a towel as there was a man in the room massaging him, the hand towel was laid on top exposing the side of my chest. My husband opened his eyes during the massage and saw his therapist staring at me. In Arabic/Muslim countries if you don\u2019t already know ---- something as small as \u201cside\u201d exposure is a sign that you are a loose woman and should be treated and thought of as such. Many would venture to say, \u201cyou should have just left rather than subject yourself to this type of treatment\u201d, and like we have all probably experienced at one or more times in our lives, OF COURSE we should have!In retrospect, I would have done it a heartbeat but we didn\u2019t. At the time we were both shocked and confused about what a traditional hamam entailed \u201cin Morocco.\u201d In the United States and any other country where my husband has worked or where we traveled, it is totally different in that it is professional, sanitary and dignified for exactly the same price! Even putting aside the entire experience of the emotional trauma and internal triggers of disrespect and disregard for the privacy of my body and the lack of dignity offered to me as a client in their spa, the most infuriating part was that Morocco being a Muslim country, more than any place in the world adheres to keeping men and women separate. It is a HUGE issue to disrespect a man by disrespecting his wife, and if a Moroccan, Muslim or Islamic man [apparently foreigners at this spa are treated with less respect than a dog at the groomer] had someone touch and rub their feet and then touch their face and head with the same oil, and in addition, treat their wife the way I was treated, he would \u201ctake action\u201d and have the support of everyone around him. Bottom line, don\u2019t be fooled by their claims, by the generic upscale spa like fa\u00e7ade that makes them look professional. You can take your chances and hope for a good massage saying, \u201cthose people reviewing just didn\u2019t have a good experience\u201d but don\u2019t forget that if you end up being treated as we were, it leaves a deeper wound than just inexperienced staff or bad luck of the draw.Also, if you read other reviews, other women have been treated disrespectfully such as being left completely nude with no indication that she might be exposed to male patrons, not to mention numerous people who contracted infections from this spa.Our Riad felt so bad and embarrassed about what happened, indicating that this was an contemptible way to treat guests in Morocco, that they refunded the money we paid for the service and said they would take it upon themselves to get the money back from the spa, communicating their atrocious behavior and treatment of guests they sent to their spa. We have recently found out up to present day the spa manager has refused to work with or compromise with the Riad. We as travelers need to stick together to keep our comments accurate and detailed to influence change or facilitate enough loss of business to stop this kind of behavior toward the travelers who bring the money and support into their economy. Trip Advisor gives us a forum to do this and it is important we ensure other travelers can count on our comments so they don\u2019t suffer the same indignities, misfortune and mistakes we endure and make it so that in the long run we can all experience the excitement, fun, beauty, pleasure and wonder travel can truly provide."

Although not much of how the 2 hours we spent a the hammam was explained to us it didn't matter because each experience was lovelier than the next.First we went downstairs and had a private hammam room ( just the 2 of us) the hot marble felt great on our achy bodies after the bustle of the medina and if you got too hot there was a shower to cool down. The only complaint was that there was a loud group out in the common area that continued to ignore the shhhs being sent their way.After the ladies came in and rubbed us down with the special black soap and hand mits they sent us out to what looked like a hot tub in the common area. Honestly, the last thing I wanted to do was get into hot water, Surprise! It was actually a perfectly temperature cool bath! After we relaxed and cooled down we went upstairs for a completely relaxing massage. We fell asleep at the end!Then we were brought out to lounge chairs to relax with mint tea and cookies.What a great experience not to be missed."

Our hammam seemed less than relaxing but extremely efficient. The lady vigorously rubbing me was professional but also had a very grandmotherly quality that made me smile. She was determined to get me sparking clean! The massage that we booked afterward, on the other hand, was very, very relaxing. It was the BEST 30 min massage I have ever had. THE. BEST. I still can't believe it was only 30 min because it was transcendent! Good pressure, attentive to all areas including scalp, hands, fingers, even toes! I left this spa feeling like a new woman. And for all those complaining about \"European\" prices....stop looking to exploit businesses in so-called developing countries; it's disgusting. There was nothing overpriced about this establishment. They made sure to include the special touches you would find in the best spas like plush robes and slippers, a bottle of water, time to relax between treatments in a mineral hot tub, etc. We truly received 4-5 star treatment in this spa and still paid 50% less than an average spa in London.

Le Bain Bleu is clearly tourist-focused and more of a spa than a traditional hammam, as is the cost. Enjoy a massage after the hammam and then find a place to relax for a couple of hours afterwards. Not confident that our tip actually made it to those who assisted us; am guessing it was pocketed by the woman who took us to pay the bill, which is done in the hotel next door.

The staff doing the Hammam and one or two of the masseuse looked like they would rather be somewhere else. The masseuse I had was excellent however, but I can't say that it was an overall enjoyable experience - the massage being by far the better part of the package. This is such a shame, the spa looked like it had undergone an expensive refurb.

The material used is somewhat rickety and the nail polish is dated thus doesn't apply nicely. Basically, as soon as I got out, I stopped by a pharmacy to get remover and some fresh polish to reapply myself."

My friend and I went for the relaxation option at 850 dihrams, and it was magnificent. First we steamed gently for a while, and scrubbed ourselves with black soap. then we had a lovely foot bath, and were smeared with some mud, then left to wallow. After that a bracing scrub with sweet smelling salts envigorated us, followed by soothing oils. I felt very relaxed, and enjoyed the face mask as well. After this we showered and were taken to a bracingly cool jacuzzi! Then came the most amazing massage of my life - and I've had a few! It must have lasted over an hour! Staff were friendly and helpful - we spoke in French, as their English is limited. I recommend this place wholeheartedly - can't wait to go back!"

Short time to relax before being covered in mud-mask (or similar, my French doesn't go that far!) and left for a while in the steam room. Then a shower and off for the massage which I must say was very good - interesting that's wife was asked to go naked but not me?

It was decorated very well and being in a Muslim country you have to comply with their rules. My husband booked the treatment, but nobody told us to bring swimming outfit. When we arrived there, since we are not prepared we decided to have a relaxing massage instead. The massage was great only I was feeling uncomfortably to be exposed unnecessarily. While the therapist is massaging my legs my upper part of the body is exposed (not happy about it). Although I tried to cover myself the therapist took no noticed of it. I was expecting them to be more conservative regarding this. One policy in massage is that 'expose only the part of the body that you need to'.Overall the massage was soothing, relaxing and the environment was decorated very well. Again quite pricy in compared to the standard ."

We got the 60 minute express scrub and massage combo (about $25 each) because we went at 4pm and they close at 5. I wanted a separate experience from my husband, but we did end up in the Jacuzzi and the end relaxation area at the same time. They scrubbed off tons of dead skin, so it was nice. The massage was relaxing; I liked it, but some might find it too light. After we got to the relaxation area at the end, I read the (only, i think) sign that said women should wear bikinis. Ooooops. I lived in Japan for five years, so I didn't think anything of walking naked around the spa. Oh, well. If they cared, they didn't show it. Staff spoke French with some limited English, so it was enough for us to get by. We could have gone to a more luxurious spa, but really you can get that anywhere. The public ones would've freaked out my husband, so this was a good compromise."

It's well hidden down a little alley behind the souqs, but is a completely different experience to the streets of Marrakech. We dropped in the day before and booked a slot for a 45 minute body scrub and a half hour massage, totalling 350 dirham each (\u00a326). You'll be asked to leave a 100 dirham deposit in case you don't turn up, but you'll get that back when you pay.When we arrived the next day, we were half an hour early, and they threw in a free pore mask for us both. If you are shy, be aware that you will be asked to remove the top of your bikini. However, if you're uncomfortable with this then I'm more than sure you won't be forced (the staff are female, so don't worry too much). Despite only booking a half-hour massage each, we were treated to a full hour of full body massage. The treatment is fantastic, nothing like anything you'll ever experience in England. Don't miss out on a hammam treatment in Marrakech; it'd be a mistake.After the treatment, we were taken to a room of loungers and given a bottle of water and a glass of Moroccan mint tea (gorgeous stuff) and left to wind down for 20 minutes or so. We weren't sure on the etiquette, but discovered that you leave at your own will, they don't come and ask you to leave. Overall, this spa is a wonderful one; the perfect balance between public and expensive spas in Marrakech."

From the start, the staff rushed us about, killing the tranquility of what appears to be a well-designed little facility. I went there with my sister. We\u2019re American, and while not puritans, we didn\u2019t want to receive our treatments together. The treatments are topless. And a brother and sister being topless together is not customary in our country. We both explained this to the staff. Initially, they told us it wasn\u2019t possible. Then they agreed. I was asked to wait about 10 minutes longer than my sister, who was escorted in for her treatment. When my sister removed her top in the little subterranean steam room, she again asked the woman if I would be going to a different room, she was told yes. About 10 minutes later I was escorted into my sister\u2019s room where she was receiving her topless treatment. She scrambled to grab her top. I averted my eyes, equally startled since we had made clear to the staff we were not a romantic couple but rather siblings. Both of us are from the West Coast of the states. So nudity is not a big deal. But what made it, at least for me, so egregious was how the staff handled the situation. First, they let it happen. In a Muslim country, if a client requests they don\u2019t want to see their sister topless, I would think this would be honored. Second, they did nothing to resolve it or even bother to apologize once it happened. Instead they just insisted we share the same room. When, out of principal, I politely refused to share the room, they just ended my sister\u2019s treatment early and ushered her out of the steam room and into the shower. They never apologized or made any indication they believed they had erred.The facilities do seem nice here, and for that I gave it two stars. But the level of service was far too low to recommend this establishment to others. Also, it is worth noting that the services are co-ed. For Europeans, this is probably not a big deal. But the American women who were receiving services seemed startled to see me, a man, escorted into the same small rooms where they were being ushered around topless. I only mention it so people, who are looking to be pampered and relax, do not find themselves in a situation that makes them uncomfortable."

Le Bain Bleu was very quick to respond to emails and the staff were able to deal with us (via email) in English or French. The treatments themselves- sauna, scrub and massage- were really good, however, it was very similar to any modern European spa, and not as authentic as you may see other places. It must be noted that most 'real' hammans will not allow a couple to be together, so it's a trade off. The scrub does use Moroccan black soap and you are offered mint tea in the relaxation room after your treatment but we had hoped for some more elements to mark it as 'Moroccan'. That said the staff were nice and the facilities are modern, clean and quite luxurious and the treatments are well priced when compared with European equivalents.Note: we brought just ourselves and our swimming costumes, we weren't given towels personally but there were some in the changing rooms and we were provided with robes and flip flops."

It's very hidden away down the windy streets but their map is good. Just follow it with confidence. When we arrived (we hadn't booked) they said they had space in 30 minutes and they took us up to the terrace for mint tea and biscuits while we waited. We opted for the Traditional Duo for 550 each and we had all the treatments together. They lead you into a changing room to get changed into paper pants (or you can bring your own spare pair!) there's a locker each so you can lock your valuables away. After a shower you lie on a hot marble shelf in a warm room until they come in and soap you down. After the soap comes the scrubbing, which feels great and it's very satisfying to see so much dead skin coming off! After the scrubbing they wipe thin mud over you and leave you a bit longer. The mud smells amazing. When they come back and rinse it off the cool water feels fantastic. You can have a shower and wash your hair before going upstairs to a lovely relaxation room for more mint tea and biscuits. Then comes the massage. Now, having had a variety of massages I can be quite hard to please. However this massage was perfect! Great pressure and did all the bits sometimes missed - hands, feet and head. After lying in the dark for about 10 minutes we came out to get dressed. Although the treatment lasted 1hr 45mins we were shocked to find out we'd been in there for 3 hours! Amazing.

My therapist was also very careful of my sun burnt bits. We did not feel rushed at any point and while the booking is for 45 minutes, with relaxation time etc we we're there for over an hour.

We had a very good hammam treatment and massage. The decoration is nice, traditional Moroccan and the service very good. We paid 1,100 Dhiram for the two of us and consider it money well spent for 1 hour and 45mins of pampering."

The Le Bain Bleu Spa was one of the highlights of a visit to the Old town of Marrakech.Wind your way through the souk and down a narrow twisty alley,and eventuallyy you find the Oasis that is the Bain Bleu. Take a good map as it is a bit of a dead end.Take a spare pair of pants as you get the full Hamman with eucalyptus oil,warm tiles and mud,then an hour of full soothing massage. We giggled like children after the first bowl of warm water was poured over us!The whole experience was blissful,though a little French will help. As with the whole city, 'fronglaise' can get confusing.I was impressed with the time taken,the attention from the staff and the overall wonderful hamman. Really good value at about \u00a345 for two hours. Very nice."

Starting with the good things: the spa is beautifully decorated in a way that feels like an excellent combintation of genuinely moroccan style and tourists' expectations. The staff is very good at their job and both the hammam treatment and massage were excellent. The hole experience was very relaxing.Based on the comparisons we made with other spas it also seemed to be good value for money.The slightly less good things: Except for the receptionist we met no staff that spoke any English and my limited French made it a bit tricky. The staff could use knowing a few key words in English and/or learn to better communicate with foreigners without repeating the same word in French over and over again. This communication difficulty also made it hard to know what to expect and what to do. (I.e. relax and rest or get dressed and leave the room etc.) When we were there they also had some issues with some showers that were temporarily out of order, but that is easy enough to fix."

            "review": "Poor Management Makes for Disappointing Experience. We were due to stay in Marrakech for a week and being Spa junkies spent ages hunting through review sites and websites to work out where to go in advance.Le Bain Bleu caught our eye - it had only recently opened and it's design looked a little more contemporary than others, plus the treatment list and prices seemed good and placed it alongside the other mid-Market Hamman's in the area.What the website fails to explain is the Hamman's is tacked onto a Raid as an additional money making stream... And it quickly became obvious that the owners had little experience in running a Spa.We booked a bath and massage package at 600 Dirhams.When we arrived our baths obviously hadn't been run so they sent us for a massage first without explaining the situation. The massage room was cold (we were later told they had a power cut but just in some rooms?!). I was never introduced to my masseuse who came in late with a cold and a dripping nose, whilst my girlfriend's ignored her request to focus on a particular area of her back that was stiff and continued to ignore her when she asked for a pillow to support her head.After being gruffly informed that the massage was over we were taken to the baths. These have been built far too long so you keep slipping down them and the bulbs in them were broken so when they 'dimmed' the lighting by turning the other lights off we were left in complete darkness, having to get out of the baths and ask them to turn the lights back on.The baths were hot, although different temperatures. That I expected, but not that we would be left without any water to hydrate. Eventually - feeling dizzy - we had to again get out of the baths (we now sat across their widths to stop us slipping down them) to leave the room and ask for a drink (initially we were told 'just last out for 10 minutes more' but bottles were eventually produced)Finally we were taken to the relaxation area which was right in the corridor between the treatment rooms so we were constantly disturbed by guests and staff coming and going.Whilst there was nothing horrendously wrong with the session everything had obviously been ill considered from the design of the spaces to the service. It appear the management had been on a token spa visit and then tried to replicate the experience without any consideration to the logistics or details.We spoke to the manager (owner?) afterwards. Whilst her co-manager texted on her blackberry next to us she rather arrogantly dismissed our disappointment. After much protesting she did eventually offer us a Hamman free of charge, but it was obvious that the service levels would not have improved in the interim and we really didn't want to go thorough the same thing again so we declined.Instead we visited Les Bains de Marrakech the next day and it was soooo good we rebooked for the following day too. They are a great example of how the extra 5% makes all the difference to the experience."

My skin was baby soft at the end. When you are done with your treatment, you take a shower and wash your hair. Then you can drink tea and eat cookies. They also let you keep your glove, which is nice. As an FYI, they give change in euros, not dirham. I believe a Spanish woman runs the place.

            "review": "Yum!. If you are in Marrakech, the Hammam is not to be missed! I just went because my wife wanted to go. Going to a spa is not something that would ever cross my mind. I usually find it to be a waste of money. It is rare to find a decent masseuse or masseur in these venues. So, I was very pleasantly surprised when the masseur at Le Bain Bleu put his hands on me. I could immediately tell that this guy knew what he was doing. I feel qualified to critique him, as I know a little about the human body. I have studied yoga for the past ten years and have taught it for the last two, I have studied massage therapy and am currently in medical school. So, I can tell if the person working on me is just doing a set a moves he was taught, or if he really knows his anatomy and how to use it. This guy was the real McCoy.But, Le Bain Bleu is not just a massage. It is a whole experience. The place is decorated beautifully, and set me at ease right away. My wife and I did a couples thing. First we were led down to the bathing room where we were laid down in a steamy room while a woman poured hot water over us then rubbed us down with that Moroccan Ghassoul soap. They keep you in your skivies, or a speedo if you choose, so you are not totally nude, so bring some dry underwear to put in the locker and wear home. After we were soaped up we were left to just relax and marinate in the low light and steam. Ahhhhh. Then she came back , rinsed off the soap of and covered us in black mud and left us to marinate again. Ahhhhhh. It was beautiful. Finally she came in, took a scrubbing glove out of a sealed wrap, one for each of us, which she gave to us afterward (no re-used gloves here) and scrubbed us down one by one. And I mean scrubbed, neck to feet, back of knees, butt, everything not covered. I was amazed at how much dead skin came off.Then an argan oil massage and some reflexology followed. And as I said before, it was done well. I was quite impressed, but that melted away into pure relaxation and bliss after a few minutes. We had been running hard the week or so previous to this in other adventures, so our muscles were in need of some TLC. And they got it. The massage lasted about 90 minutes, then they finished us off with about thirty minutes of reflexology, which I had seen on the menu and had requested. Finally, we were led to a pair of lounge chairs in our cozy robes and served some of that delicious Moroccan mint tea. and again we were left to just enjoy and relax. The staff was in no hurry to hustle us along. My wife and I just eased back and enjoyed the tea.Overall we were there about four hours. For hours of bliss. And for the two of us it cost about \u20ac175.00 ($270.00US) that is including a nice tip. There are lots of hammams in Marrakech, many for the locals are less expensive. But, I did not go to any of those and do not know what they are like. What I do know is that Le Bain Bleu hit the spot! My wife has brought me to some nice spas and massages over the years and she always asks me if I enjoyed it afterwards. I always tell her yes (which is wise when she is spending $400 bucks for a two hour couples massage as a gift for us), and it usually is \"nice.\" But, I never had the desire to go back to these places again. I actually want to go back to Le Bain Bleu. I highly recommend it."

A tradional hamman using savon noir, rubbed down and scrubbed ( gommage) by the hamman attendant ( a very nice young lady) using a kessa glove, followed by an application of rhassoul( clay) before rinsing off. Mint tea was then served in a relaxtion room.As previously stated Le Bain Bleu is tucked away. Head to the Moussine Mosque, take the derb signposted for Dar Cherifa and just keep going. It looks like a dead end but continue on. You will reach a T junc, bear right and the Hamman is on the left. It would benefit greatly if it had a sign outside and one at the top of the derb.Highly recommended. Check out their website."

The experience was fantastic and was about 45 minutes - even if you are unlikely to visit a spa or get a massage (like me) it was a great way to see a new aspect of the culture here in Morocco. The owner is also fantastic, and is great to talk to if you are from the United States - he is originally from Morocco, but spent significant time in the States and is especially friendly and sociable to travelers. He gave us a great deal, great service, and was more than happy to answer any questions about the rest of our trip. There are probably higher quality, longer Hammams, but if you want a cheaper, quicker and still great alternative, come here!"

When we arrive the owner Damane Ziani welcomed us, we paid 250 dirham each (\u00a320) for a homage (scrub) and massage. We were each given a basket with bath robe and towel in and were taken into a small candle lit room for mint tea. Five minutes later I was taken to an anti room with lockers for my belongings (men and women go to separate areas) where I undressed and were given disposable knickers to hide my modesty. There could be other women in the Hammam at the same time so don't be shy. The ladies don't speak very good English but their gestures are adequate to understand. I was led into a room with marble type beds where I was washed with black soap and rinsed, then into the steam room for about fifteen minutes. Then back to the first room where I was scrubbed vigorously from head to foot, the amount of dead skin that comes off is unbelievable, washed again then taken to the massage room. I borrowed a towel from my hotel to put on the bed as they have plastic coverings and can be a bit slippery. Oil was applied and then I had the best massage ever including a head massage. Next I was led back to the first room where I was washed with a soapy scrunchy had my hair washed and conditioned and rinsed again. The women then helped me on with the bathrobe and wrapped the towel around my head and led me back to the anti room where I dressed. When we arrived the owner had said \"no tipping\" and there are signs all over, but the ladies do gesture for money and say \"sh\" not to tell the boss, but I gave my lady a tip as I thought she deserved it.We both felt clean, refreshed and relaxed and our skin was really soft and glowing. I would definitely recommend Hammam Ziani. Give it a go.Can't wait to return next year.Ps Damane has two beautiful little dogs called Rex and Rosie and a shop next door that sells natural oils and soap."

My husband and I booked an evening hammam session during our honeymoon and we chose Hammam Ziani for the reported authenticity - it being the only 'moroccan' Hammam and unlike a western spa. We were happy that they also provided men for men masseuses and women for women. Once I went into the women's section, they gave me a cloth to wrap around my chest and disposable underwear. However, perhaps due to a lack of English speakers that work at the Hammam, it seemed like they were not respectful or receptive to my own shyness about being without clothing. In previous spa experiences, there seems to be a bit more privacy, at least whereby the masseuse and yourself are in a room separate to other clients. I found it uneasy that there were 4 other customers getting the Hammam treatment at the same time in the same room.The steam room was nice and hot, and the scrub part was also nice with excellent exfoliation. Again, I think the communication skills were the biggest point to fix here - the people who work there are really lovely and sweet and well meaning, but a bit more basic English training would be so helpful! After the scrub was the massage, which was a good massage but from a personal perspective, being alone in that room and not knowing anyone or their language made me unable to fully experience the calm and comfort of the Hammam, and this could perhaps be rectified with a more personal treatment - or introduction of names from masseuses. All in all, I think if you're a shy person like me, then maybe opt for a more western style private Hammam - this one was authentic, but hygiene could be improved as there was lots of hair everywhere and the turnover between clients was too fast to clean massage beds etc. My husband had a good time as he was the only person being treated in the men's section, and had more of an individualised approach. Again hygiene was a slight issue, and this can be easily rectified if the Hammam take on fewer clients at one time and take more time to clean between them! All in all, thanks for our first Hammam experience, but not as spectacular as we were expecting."

We went in the evening to this beautiful and clean hammam with a bit of bartering on the door and decided to go for the gommage hammam without the massage as we had just been on a trek up to the summit of Mt Toubkal and wanted a good clean!My boyfriend had a great experience firstly being steamed, then showered, then scrubbed and pulled and stretched, showered, then soaped down kind of massaged and then steam room and showered again. He came out relaxed, happy and very clean.I however was firstly in the steam room and then scrubbed with a traditional mit and soap and then brought back to the steam room however the steam never came on so I lay for about 25 minutes in a mildly steamy room waiting to be collected. When i finally was I was quickly soaped off (the soap smelt amazing) and then left to get changed. Although I had definitely been scrubbed I was disappointed with my experience, especially compared to my boyfriend so we decided to go back the next day. When we explained the situation the man on the front desk was very understanding and explained that the staff were often exhausted by the end of the day during ramadan and he apologised a lot, offering another hammam which I turned down so then gave us a hammam mit and the best soap they had. Overall this was a good experience and I would recommend this place, but maybe be aware that your treatment may be rushed at the end of the day during ramadan."

Basically you would get a lengthy wash with assistance and massage (not so proper massage) even unexperienced ones could do it better. So you would get a basket that has towel/robe if you were lucky, small piece of cloth/apron to wrap around your lower body so you would not be completely naked throughout the process and a pair of slippers. You would then be taken to the shower and then they would put on a mud all over your body. You would then be asked to go to steam room for at least 15 minutes. Tip not to touch your eyes as it really stings. Then you would be taken for another shower. Then you would be asked to lay on those slippery covered mat massage table. Then you would be applied with oil and you would be scrubbed to almost having your skin peeled off. It was hard. Then another shower and then they would give you a massage that wasn't the best. At one point I thought I wouldn't be able to walk after as he kept on massaging my Achilles Tendon and it did hurt. That was the longest 30 minutes of my life. Then final shower and off you go. Though it was clearly posted everywhere not to tip but the masseure would still begged for it. You get a mint tea after that physical torture. It was just good to try but if I had gotten what I was told then I wasn't probably writing an average review. It was way too pricey for a lengthy wash."

Basically you are coming for a thorough cleanse but they also offer dry massage if you prefer.You enjoy a traditional mint tea after which you go to the changing rooms and lockers. You are provided with sandals and a small apron or towel. You shower first. Then a good coating of essential oils is applied and you start with a spell in the steam room followed by another shower. Your masseuse then gives you a really good oiling which helps remove the grime and dead skin. You are then scrubbed down, as hard or soft as you like!! Another shower and then a lengthy massage, finally a really good soapy wash and final shower.Although you are advised not to tip your guy does expect something as is usual throughout Morocco for any service. You can then relax with another tea before perhaps going for a walk and hearty meal!!Its an interesting experience but just a little pricey. Perhaps other hammams are cheaper so it might be worth shopping around!"

I'm a man, so this was the male experience:* Arrived and had price options explained to me. There are no baths, just the steam and massages. I chose the full package because it was only about $40 USD for 90 minutes.* Men massage the male customers. Women massage the female customers.* Changed clothes in a locker room. They gave me a towel/cloth to wrap around my waist so I wasn't naked at any time with the masseur or in the steam room. * Masseur washed me down with some soap and I led me to the steam room with the soap still on for about 10 minutes (hint, don't touch your eyes because the soap stings)* Masseur collected me from steam room, I rinsed off in shower, laid on table, got an incredible exfoliation for about 15-20 mins. They really scrub you with a loofah. Hard.* Next received a great massage. Like the best in my life. I was covered in some oil or soap that made it very slippery. The guy was great. I would guess this was about 30 mins* Then i got a mud cleansing. That could have been skipped but added another 20 mins to my experience. Rubbed some mud on me. Covered me in a plastic sheet to bake for 10 mins. * Masseur took me to the showers to rinse off. He scrubbed off the mud and oils.* Masseur hit me up for a tip at the end even those signs say no tips. I gave him the equivalent of about 5 USD.At no point wer my butt or other unmentionable areas touched. It was a very appropriate experience for shy Americans!Overall fantastic!"

I chose to visit here based on reviews on here and decided this would be the one for me ... additionally it was just around the corner from my Riad so saved getting lost ! I chose the popular 270 dirham package. I went mid morning and the place was pretty quiet. I got the customary tea and bottle of water and my bag with robe etc in it. As I didnt fancy the disposable knickers I wore my bikini bottoms and they were fine with that, although they did give me what is commonly known as a \"wedgy\" when doing their scrub lolYes it takes us uptight Brits out of our comfort zone - it's get your kit off and get oin with it. No need for embarrassment, this is just a job t them that they do every day and your body is not sexualised. I seen a lady here saying she felt uncomfortable because one of the hammam ladies undid her bra for her ... she was probably trying to be helpful and also wanting to get on with her job. it's US that are uptight about it, it's natural to them. Anyway, i digress.Into the steam room - wasnt too steamy but you can have it turned up no problem. out of there and into the \"bath\", washed with \"black soap\" (feels like silk on your skin), then given the exfoliation rub and boy do they do it well. Lots of dead skin off. it's not like a Turkish hamman where you are drowned in soapy bubbles, it's very different. Next - off to the massage room where I had the best massage of my life. I was oiled up and the lady's fingers got into, and inbetween, every muscle and boy did it feel good! Every part of my body was massaged, even my ears. Yes they do get close to the groin area but stop short of it and never once did I feel uncomfortable, worried or unsafe. You lie on a table that is covered in an oilcloth type cover that is slathered in oil ...it's slippy so sometimes you feel the need to hang on to the edges.After that back to the bath area to be washed down again and hair washed. Then back to the changing room, get dressed then off to the waiting room to have more tea if you wish.I wasnt aske donce for tips, although my masseus kept hanging around when I was getting dressed and smiling at me so I guess she was wanting something, however a big crowd of women had just come in so she was then busy with themMy whole experioence lasted almost two hoursI can safely say it was the best 270 dirhams I spent in MarrakechI'm going back to Marrakech in two weeks time and this place will be my first stopdo it ...throw away any inhibitions and just go for it ... you'll love itI loved this place and felt like annew person when I was"

We were sat down, given Moroccan tea and a bottle of water each & then were told in detail about the packages they had to offer. It's strictly segregated for men & women which we were very pleased with. We put our stuff away in the lockers and taken to sauna/steam room. The ladies were so jolly and we had loads of giggles with them. They aren't very fluent in English but we managed just fine. We paid 330 dirhams (roughly \u00a323.50) for 30min sauna/steam, hammam scrub, 45min almond oil massage, mud wrap and bath. It was a very relaxing 2hr session. The scrub and massage were AMAZING. The women work really hard and give 110%. Overall it was a bargain and we all loved it and would definitely go again. Our hotel spa charged 350 dirhams just for a 30 min massage. What a rip off! This place is value for money, I highly recommend it! P.S - we were not hassled for tips at all. We paid up front and got great service."

I've been to hamam before and I expected not to be wearing clothes, but it was a bit unnerving to have one of the female staff unhook my bra FOR me as I got undressed. I brushed it off. They give you a disposable thong to \"cover up\" - which I really wasn't sure if they were new or just washed and put back into a plastic bag. It was massive and didn't fit, which is slightly uncomfortable if you expected to be a tad covered; really it was for show. The steam room was fine, but the small pads to sit on looked like they hadn't been washed in ages and with the tiny thong, I was especially glad to be scrubbed down after. The woman who walked me through was pleasant, though a bit invasive, rubbing all the way up the crotch (though she did stop when asked, good). I hadn't expected having a naked massage lying a foot away from another client and her friend as they were also being massaged. The staff were chatting and giggling to each other the whole time and I also had to firmly tell the practitioner to stop massaging my breasts. The rest of the massage was fine, and I enjoyed the wash down/shampoo after. It just wasn't as relaxing as anticipated."

Glass windows allow shafts of coloured light in, creating a magical misty atmosphere. After about 10-15minutes a lady came and collected me, taking me through to a room with beds in, where she washed me down before giving me my scrub. I particularly enjoyed the foot scrub - so she did it twice! Then I was lead through to the massage room - half an hour of pure bliss. I almost fell asleep!

Facilities were reasonable for the price you pay as you can see the price difference in the other private hammams."

We paid 270 dirhams each and it was worth the money. Very professional and the bath and the massage was excellent. Could not fault one bit. They do both men and women. When we arrived we were welcomed. Sat in a beautiful lounge and given mint tea. Then we were both taken to the hammam men and women separately. When I left this place all I wanted to do is just sleep that is how good it was. They have a very strict policy of no tipping but I wanted to empty my wallet to the guy who did the bath and massage that is how good I felt. I would recommend anyone to try this and they won't be disappointed. Thanks to the staff. Will visit again when I come back to Marrakech. Thanks guys."

Men and women use different areas. We went in the morning. It was quite and there was no one but my sister and myself (and the lady staff) in the place. We went for the full package at 350 dirhams and were delighted. Lovely women ( didn't speak English but we could communicate well enough) -doing our hamame and great massage. Also had a mud wrap,and steam room treatment that was bliss. The place is so relaxing. We were in there a couple of hours at least. A real highlight of our trip to Marrakech.

To start with the worst part of the Ziani experience: After a horrible 2 hours in Hammam Ziani, we went to a shop right next to Ziani Hammam (same building as Hammam Ziani, sells towels, body lotions, oil etc.) what we saw there in the shopping area was unbelievable!!! There was a screen with live video surveillance from the locker rooms in Ziani Hammam. We could see naked customers in the locker room!! Anyone who goes to that store can see this screens and see the customers in the changing rooms!!! Something like that should be forbidden!!! Ziani experience: My friend and I were looking for a relaxing massage and therefore stopped at Hammam Ziani. They explained that they offer a 1h20min Hammam experience for 27 Euros. Since we only wanted to have a massage, we asked if it was possible to skip the Hammam and just get a massage. It was possible so we booked 2 massages for 15 minutes later. When we came back we had to wait in the waiting area. Nobody told us how long we have to wait, so after 10 minutes we asked them. After 10 more minutes we could go to the locker rooms. After that a woman brought us and two other girls to the steam bath. We were surprised that we would go to the steam bath given the fact that we booked a massage and not a Hammam. The steam bath was really grubby. We had to sit on uncleaned plastic mats without a towel or something... After another 5 minutes we asked why we are here since we actually booked a massage. The women were very surprised when we told them that we had only booked a massage, so they send us back to the steam bath. After a couple of minutes they brought us to a room with 5 massage tables. It was so cold that both of us were freezing. The tables we covered with white plastic, they were still oily and there was still hair on the plastic from the previous customer. They asked us to lay down. We both found it really grose but since we were there for a massage... we did it. The massage itself was ok. Not very good, but ok. BUT... it was sooo cold and it was so loud! There were always people in the room, new customers coming and going, different staff coming and going, i had several people touching my legs because they passed by my table. It was absurd. After the massage, they washed us with an old sponge (they even put it in our faces!!). Then we got some old and wet towels to dry ourselfs!!! After 2 hours we left the Hammam and the only thing we wanted was a hot shower!!"

It was what I had expected (the cleanliness, the staff, the package and the treatments).However, I have a few qualms about the place:1. My sister later informed me that only two options were available in French and English - the 270 DH treatment, and the \u2018full\u2019 package at something around 350 DH (which includes a seaweed wrap). However, options in Arabic showed one treatment that costs 120 DH. Now, I knew the star-studded clientele was a mere marketing ploy, which was not the primary reason we chose this hammam; however, after finding out the price differences, I feel as though we may have unknowingly paid for a marketing stunt we did not want to be part of.2. The constant loud chatter by the Moroccan women. Not as peaceful as I'd like. 3. As we retreated to the tea area by the reception, the owner came in to give orders to a Moroccan woman known as \u2018Nina\u2019. It was in Arabic so I could not understand a word, however, to a non-Arabic guest, it came across as loud, crass, and frankly, embarrassing. It was not the \u2018relaxation area\u2019 they claim it to be, with the owner constantly calling (read: shouting) for \u2018Nina\u2019 from the door of the hammam to one of the back rooms.These are my only qualms for Hammam Ziani. It is definitely a \u2018mid-range\u2019 hammam; it was not public yet the women were not clad in an all-white attire. However, 270 DH is a little steep to pay for the experience - it is definitely catered for tourists and Western pockets."

Hammam Ziani was a good entry point to an authentic hammam, without the crowds of local women chatting away as they scrub themselves. The masseuse was a genius, saying I must have a bad headache (I did!) because I was holding a lot of tension in my neck, and within minutes she had worked it out. It is not a luxury spa experience, and you might not want to look too closely at the surroundings, but all in all it's a good experience and well worth going. On a side note, I did have some sort of reaction to the clay mud mask, but I do have sensitive skin, so I put that down to my own fault not theirs."

THIS IS NOT A HAMMAM! It's a disgusting building full of dirt and all things gross, like pubic hair and dirt! My sincere apologies to all people reading this, I do not usually use caps when writing, indeed it's seen as shouting! I do feel like shouting right now!Right, cut a long story short, on our second evening in Marrakech, we went here after seeing it's ranked no.9 in the Spa's and Wellbeing section!I made an awful decision going there and the fact that I still remember the awful time and the horrid filth I saw in Hammam Zaini, months on, is proof enough that it affected me in a very bad way.Paid for a 1hr40minute package, got a 1hr10min (if that) of nothing, almost nothing. My brother paid extra for a more luxurious scrub, and longer massage - he was out, sitting in the waiting room, before My mother and I were changed and out!The nicest bot of this hammam is the communal waiting room. Once inside the hammam, you will find it's dirty, smelly. They rush you through the whole hammam, not even rubbing the black gommage stuff on you, they make you do it yourself, then ask you to go sit in a hot room, as I sat, there was brown gross stuff on the benches, looked to right and left and there was PUBIC HAIR lots of it! That hot room hadn't been cleaned for at least a month at least!They leave you in there ages, then bring you out, tell you to splash yourself with water, tell you to lay down on a plastic table covered with a plastic dinner table cover - this has been previously used and they tell you, get on it without cleaning it or anything!The woman then and gave me a 10 minute massage! when my package clearly stated 25 minutes, then demanded tips...right by the sign it says no tips!Please save your money, avoid this! I am going to be in Marrakech next month, I am going to try Hammam De La Rose this time and I'll report back.If anyone reading this wants to advise me on a good hammam to go to, please message me.

I realised too late and had already been covered in other people's dead skin - yuck!- The place looks lovely from outside and even going in. But the massage tables are slimed up plastic covered in other people's hair and dead skin.- The gommage was super fast and done to get us out ASAP, and the massage was on yet another dirty and slimy plastic massage table.It is way too over priced and I feel robbed of an amazing Moroccan hammam experience. I would highly urge everyone to keep walking and find a nicer more authentic and hygienic hammam.Do not be fooled by how friendly people are before you go in. I'm sure they are lovely people, but the whole thing is designed to get as many foreigners in and out as possible. Relaxing? The total opposite!"

I would definitely go again.

Very friendly man who told us he was born in Casablanca but grew up in San Franciso. He spoke several languages very well including English. He took the time to tour us through the hamman and explained the service to us. We had our 2 children ages 8&11 with us and we wanted to find a hamman that would be suitable for all. We were impressed with the cleanliness of the facility and the time he took to talk us through the experience. We even enjoyed some tea and he gave us some suggestions on what we should see and do in Marrakech. Based on this, we decided to come back the next day for the service. Big mistake! We arrived and the owner was not present however they welcomed us in. Children were supposed to be half price (clearly marked on the price sheet) but they charged us 200dh instead of 175dh. No explanation and our fault for not questioning. As we were 2 males and 2 females we were separated and each taken to our own sections. At check in we were given baskets containing robes, disposable underwear, new gloves(for the scrubbing). Once in the change room, the attendant helped us to disrobe (very awkward for a Westerner but we assumed this is just how it goes). No robe and nothing for our chests. The owner had told us clearly that we would be given cloths to cover our breasts. We were taken into a shower room and were doused with hot water than told to lie on the ceramic tables where they covered us with the \"black soap\". There was very little product on us and then we were told to go into the sauna. It was just me and my daughter as the spa was empty. The sauna was warm at best and the steam only hit our faces so we were actually feeling cold. They left us there for quite a long time. So long that we actually called out to see if they had forgotten us. They came back and said 2 minutes. It was another 10 before they returned. We were taken back to the ceramic table and the scrubbing began. I noticed that the glove used was not the same one as was in my basket (different color) and I quickly figured out it was not a new glove, but a used one they pulled from a bucket. Gross! We were scrubbed down and they chatted very loudly the entire time so it was not relaxing. They then took us into the massage room which contained 4 tables covered with cracked plastic. They were dirty, covered in hair and skin. When they realized we noticed, they quickly rinsed them off. We were covered in thick oil and then we had to hang onto the table sides as we both felt we would slide off otherwise. Not relaxing at all! Once the massage was done we were taken again to the ceramic tables to be rinsed off. At this point they washed our hair and then used a very stiff brush to get out the tangles. The brush came out of the same bucket as the scrubbing gloves. They then told us we were finished and she wrapped me In a robe. I put my hands in the pocket and found a used Kleenex. Again, disgusting. Once we were dressed, there was no one anywhere so we went into the tea room to find the rest of our family. No one ever came back so we poured our own tea which was cold. My husband and son were both asked for tips and there are sign everywhere clearly stating \" no tips\". Obviously we did not tip. This was a horrible experience, dirty and impersonal. Do yourself a favour and pay the extra money to go to a proper hamman. As a side note, my daughter had a reaction to the soap (was very itchy during the sauna) and my face broke out after all the heavy oil that was used."

I don't know if I got a rough massage or if it was rougher than than the others - this could be replaced by seaweed therapy), getting a clay treatment, and tea at the end!I thought the experience might be weird and awkward but sometimes I'd look at the lady in the eyes to see if she thought it was weird and awkward and she would often just flash me a bright, motherly smile which made me feel better about the whole experience.This hammam is right next to Palais Bahia (kind of sandwiched between both the square and the Palace) and would recommend it as a convenient and nice spot. I was told that it wasn't an authentic experience since the \"real\" experience would all happen in one room and they'd lay me down on the floor for a cheaper price, but I thought it was a good introduction to whole \"having someone wash you\" and \"spending 3 hours naked with other girls\". The awesome:-There are signs everywhere saying that \"Tips are prohibited\" which is nice considering that everyone else in Marrakesh will ask you for one. -There's a hair dryer (included) and argan oil cream that you can use afterwards (also included). The bad:-I'm not sure the ladies there speak French. This experience might be a little harder for those who don't speak French (you'll have to do a lot of guessing with their gestures and body language).-The whole experience was 3.5 hours long. My friend and I had someone almost alert the police that we went missing because we didn't think this would take more than 2 hours."

Description of the 2 packages.I went with two other people. The steam room wasn't hot enough. You had to sit higher up to benefit from the steam which still meant my face was steamed and not the rest of my body. The steam room was also very dark.My massage was very gentle. Granted I could have asked for more effort. My two companions had a better massage.The scrub which I thought would be more aggressive was again very weak so I don't imagine would have taken any substantial skin off. I think it really depends on who you get.During the massage the workers were a bit chatty, but when one of my companions joked that she wanted to sleep, the workers quitetened down.Considering we were semi naked having these treatments, I was horrified to see and hear a man walking back and forth outside the massage room. This was very disappointing considering we were told it was separate for ladies and men.There was no one available to complain to at the end so I cut my losses and left.If you want a cheap and cheerful experience without the luxury experience then this is the place for you."

We were shown around the hammam when we got there, and then the man on reception (who could speak perfect English, and had the cutest dogs! He even went and got his new puppies so we could have a cuddle with them!) explained the 2 packages we could have. We went for the hammam and half hour massage, which took about an hour and a half or there abouts, and cost us about \u00a318. You could have a longer experience for a little bit more, which included a wrap/body mask and a longer massage. We waited in a room where we had mint tea before being sent through to the changing rooms, where we were handed flip flops and a TINY paper thong. I am a size 20 and they fit me, they are stretchy so if you are slightly bigger, don't worry! We then had loads of water thrown over us and then shown the steam room, then more water and a scrub, then another go in the steam room, then an amazing massage, possibly the hardest one I have ever had, but it was so good! Then we had a hair wash and laid on a concrete bed and had yet more water poured over us to get rid of the oil from the massage. The ladies that worked in there were very sweet and guided you from place to place, and had a laugh with us too! It was definitely an experience, and you must do it when you are in Marrakech!"

I read some of the reviews before visiting Hammam Ziani, but no matter all the detailed descriptions the treatment my friend and I had there came as a big surprise and is definitely a memorable one. We showed up around 8 pm knowing that they are open till 10 pm and asked for the package that includes mud wrap and lasts 2 hours. First we were escorted to the ladies' changing room and given slippers, thongs and a dressing gown to put on. When we were ready were led a room where we got splashed by buckets of warm water and then to the steam room where we had to wait a while. It was a bit noise due to the steam machine hidden somewhere near to it and the temperature was just okay, not really warm though. We were asked to return to the room for a very thorough scrub then splashed again and directed to the massage room where we received a top of our heads to the end of our toes oil massage that was very strong. Then we had to return to the steam room and lay down to have our bodies covered in mud then wrapped in foil. The steam came on again as it was turned off when no one was in and we were waiting in our mummy wrap. In the end we got thoroughly washed and soaped and splashed and could leave feeling completely refreshed.I only recommend this experience to those who like firm massage, who are not shy and happy with women staff touching them almost everywhere (both the wash and the massage is front and back) and don't mind indelicate treatment."

The Hammam started with a steam room (with not so much steam), after I got my personal guy putting soap on me ans scrubbing me. Finally there is a full body massage which was good. The beds where not so comfortable (plastic, quite hard) without privacy (3 beds in a cramped room with other people) and the masseuses talking with each other. You see signs with 'no tips' everywhere, but still I got asked for it multiple times afterwards. The whole experience took about 1 hour. I have been to a Hammam in Turkey 1 time before, so maybe I don't have good comparison or this is the more traditional one.

You will be scrubbed, rubbed and left feeling brand new.The massage and scrubbing are not gentle however that is what the hammam is about! The owner was very nice I was feeling dizzy and he brought me water and asked a host to watch me as I would be in the steam room.I recommend this hammam , everything is very upfront and efficient. If you dobt know the process do ask for a breakdown where you pay. Staff English is non existent (french is perfect) but really what do you expect the women to say to you whilst your nearly nude and they are scrubbing off your dead skin? Yes they do hold you by your arm, I think it's done so you don't slip whilst walking and go onto the right place for the right treatment. The women mean you no harm, everything that they can do for you to make your time pleasant they do, from attempting to put slippers on your feet, helping put your items in a locker to wrapping your towel around you when you finish.I enjoyed my massage, it was rough but relaxing, it didn't remind me of a swedish or a sports massage. They rub everything and if you do not want something done just gesture and then add 'no'. I had a great time as did my mum we left glowing.Yes in the changing area it says no tips, I think it's written as some tourists where frustrated with being asked. You can say NO but I am sure if you know what service to expect and base it on the service you receive and how refreshed you'll feel you will want to. The ladies aren't expecting anything big if you go with expecting to tip 20dh and very rough but loving treatment the experience will very pleasant and unlike the horror stories of the lower stared reviews.Enjoy your hammam experience!"

After the sauna you get scrubbed down to get rid of the dead skin, real good scrub! Then you have a massage and after, another wash down. They also washed my hair and platted it for me.

On arrival the friendly multilingual staff explain the facilities and cost which is good value for facilities like this aimed at giving tourists an authentic experience.

After changing into small garments (paper pants for ladies and what can only be described as a very small sarong for men) you are lead through to the hammam. After time relaxing in the steam you are scrubbed, washed, massaged and washed again with great efficiency while still being looked after and allowed time to relax. Although the outfits aren't exactly dignified the staff ensure you feel at ease. All of the staff in the hammam are extremely polite and helpful. I would recommend anyone visiting Marrakech should try the hammam for an authentic experience at a reasonable price. The massage was one of the best I've had (even better than in some of the decent UK spas) and the staff were excellent - if you have any issues such as bad back/neck speak to the staff on reception who will explain to the others so that they are careful to accommodate this (my mum really appreciated their care)."

On day 3 I insisted on a massage through a Hammam and used trip advisor to search and get reviews for Hammam's in Marrakech. There were some that are highly rated but the time and price (\u20ac90) didn't suit me so thought it wasn't going to happen. After a visit to Palace Bahia, the wife and I decided to walk to the Souk. A 2 minute walk from the Palace my wife spots Hammam Ziani. We decided to check it out. Reception was great. Tea offered for free and we were shown the Hammam. We said we weren't sure and the gentleman said no obligation but I insisted to the wife that we make an appointment. Gentleman said when you're ready just make your way over. I had checked the price during the conversation and it was 270 Dirhams or approximately \u00a318 for the hour treatment which included steam room, scrub, rinse, massage and final rinse/shower. Didn't make the Hammam on day 3 but returned day 4 and the gentleman remembered me. Arrived at 10.30am and finished at 12pm. So, all of the above included and you can dictate how hard or soft you want the massage and scrub, or areas to focus on. Wife wasn't well on day 4 so sat inside being offered tea with no charge.In summary an absolute delight and well worth the treatment. I left the Hammam lost for words. It's hard to describe the feeling of relaxation when you leave. It has to be an experience you have to have. The wife and I will be back no doubt. An absolute pleasure and a great experience when it comes to customer service. Well done Hammam Ziani."

We went with no expectations and were very pleasantly surprised.Ziani met us at the door and showed us around before we decided to go ahead. We went for the full treatment and sat in the quiet area with a cold bottle of water (supplied) to await our treatment.After 5 minutes we were taken to the changing area where we were supplied with a loin cloth and robe and stored our clothes in a lockable, but not too sturdy, locker (be sensible and don't take valuable items anywhere in Marrakech). From there we showered and shown to the steam room and soaped up with the dark soap and left to sweat. Steam room was hot but recommend sitting up high as the room was quite tall so best heat at the top. We were then taken to the table and scrubbed down with the mitten and showered. After this we were covered in oil and a very thorough massage. After that we were covered in almond mud, wrapped up and left to relax, and the mud to take affect, for a while. Finished off by being washed and soaped with lovely hot water and sponge. At all times we felt well looked after and guided and couldn't fault the experience, especially when you consider the price (250 dirhams each for two hours of attention with their August Special offer). There was just four men when we visited, it might be a bit more rushed/crowded in peak season but great when we went. This place is not a \"Spa\" but you do feel you're getting an insight into a traditional Hammam without feeling too much of a tourist. We'd highly recommend anyone visit (they have separate Hammams for men and women so unable to comment of the woman's). Great place, Great value, Great Experience!"

This is a public Hammam, so you will be surrounded by other naked people of your gender. They will provide with a pretty small thong and sandals. And then you'll go through the process of getting washed, steamed, scrubbed, massaged and washed again. This place isn't fancy but it's very relaxing and the people that work there put their back into it! My massage and scrub were amazing and a week later my skin still is so soft. I recommend this on the 1st of 2nd day you arrive, in order to prepare your skin for a nice tan also the scrubbing will be really painful if you are sun burnt! If you can get comfortable quickly with nudity, and you are ok with getting washed and massaged you'll definitely enjoy this. Is a very different experience but very relaxing and fun none the least.

We felt like hearded cattle the whole way through. The scrubbing didn't last very long at all. The massage was very weak and the bed was not very sturdy with a cracked plastic cover on it. The sponges they used to scrub with had been used on previous people and weren't fresh. None of the masseuses spoke english so we had to communicate by gesturing. The soap they used to wash us down afterwards felt like dishwashing liquid. Overall an ok, and just an ok, experience. I would NOT recommend anyone use this place!"

We were first shown around and then shown the list of services available (in french and english). we went for the hammam and massage at 270dh which is a good price we felt.This is not for the shy as they do insist you strip down to just paper pants they provide, i went with a friend and our prudishness wanted to take over but i urge you to just get on with it and we actually felt it was liberating! (the men and women are in seperate places!)we were lucky enough to have the place to ourselves, it was a great and relaxing experience, the massage was divine and we felt like our skin was glowing afterwards! this was one of the highlights of our trip so highly recommended! the ladies were lovely and welcoming (despite mainly only speaking french but we communicated by the universal language of gestering!)Great experience."

What we got is 45min being there all together in this very filthy place with pubic and other hair laying on the massage bed, even the towels they gave us were used and dirty. Therapist who distroyed us in 15min very deep tissue massage, without and warming up muscles so we were aching all night and day with bruises, massage lasted 15min ( She did it like She was angry on us) and they were pushing us from one room to other, grubbing us for upper arm like we are kids and forcing us to hurry up... At the end they were pressuring us for TIPS, even with big printed signs everywhere \" No tips!\"I tried to talk with someone there but suddenly no one spoken English, French and Arabic only! Customer care is present only during the booking and charging for service, they are all smiley there but this place needs to be closed down forever and owners should be punished for robbing tourists!Stay away from this dirty horrible nasty place of horror and tell everyone else to avoid it if you don't want to get skin desease or bruises from horrible massage.this experience spoiled our last day of holiday and We are still in pain from massage."

Be prepared to strip almost naked - the 'thong' provided doesn't make much difference but there are very separate men and women sections so no embarrassment! The scrub/steam/massage/wash down/hair wash was blissful and very relaxing - I could have easily drifted off to sleep. Wrapped up in a big towel robe, then a refreshing mint tea to end, before facing the heat and onslaught of the souks again! 270dh/\u00a320 for around 80-90 mins - very good value and highly recommended."

The first we have have experienced as a couple and as a spa. When we visited Hammam Zianni, we had a lot to compare with. To help you choose, I have written the points we liked below:1. It is a nice practical and value for money experience.2. It is clean, friendly, simple and efficient with good quality materials used.3. It is not a posh spa so don't expect that and you won't be disappointed. That is not to say it was not spa like, it was friendly which to me aren important especially when you are only wearing some modest plastic pants, you don't want to feel awkward and the experience was really relaxing.4. We did the normal rub down with savoun beldi, wait in steam area and then scrub down, rinse and onto massage table. Had a great massage followed by a full body mud mask. Then washed hair and next scrub, wash down and finish. Really worth every penny. They have hair dyers and I did not have to wait to use it. I suspect that if lots finish at same time you could have a rush...5. We went at 3.00pmish and I had the place to myself. It started to fill up when I was leaving at 5.00pm ish.Book it you will enjoy the experience and the friendly people at the Hammam."

I personally don't like too much hammams with a \"Spa character\". I love the real oriental feeling of being in such an authentic and characteristic place as hammam Ziani getting my traditional washing and a very good and strong massage like the moroccan women are used to have it since hundreds of years. For me it's not just a beauty program! It's leaving the noisy world outside for an hour or two, being on my own, receiving this archaic method of washing and scrubbing the body and maybe also the mind. Entering the hammam, it's a little bit like going back into your mothers womb. Naked, dark, moisturized, warm and tender. The old skin gets off, and we are coming out again like a new born baby. I've also tested several other hammams. But always I got less service for double price. Especially the massage was more like a caress with oil. At Hammam Ziani the massage is the best I've ever had! Very good price performance ratio! No reservation needed. You simply drop in, whenever you feel like. You will be very satisfied and tired afterwards. So maybe try to make it in the evening and drink some water, before you go! I'm sure you will have an unforgettable experience!"

            "review": "Pretty friendly with foreigners but still authentic enough. This place is by no means a \"real\" neighbourhood hammam, it is mainly oriented to foreigners, as it is a little bit more upscale (without really being fancy) and you don't really have to know the ritual in order to do your thing (which could be a little bit frustrating the first times you do it), so, if you are looking for a nice relaxing time before you leave Morocco or are a trying to ease yourself into the Hammam experience, this place is for you. We decided to go right after our return from a few days camping in the desert and and excruciating 10 hour long drive back from the Sahara, we were in need for something relaxing. There is people giving out flyers outside this place virtually the whole day. We had one and decided to go there early-ish the next day; it was pretty hard to find again, but the tip is to get to the Palace first and walk from there. You can pay either in Euros or Dirhams, which was pretty convenient cause it was our last day and we didn't want to change more money (beware that the conversion rate is not the best, but we were happy with it), we ended up paying 25 EUR each for the basic service (hammam, scrubbing and massage), they give you a little basket with towel, robe, a loincloth and the scrub thing they use (so you don't really need to bring anything). They will guide you to a waiting room and feed you the customary mint tea. My girl and I got separated from there (for obvious reasons). They have a changing room with lockers where you pretty much strip down naked and put on the loincloth (the girls get one of those one use disposable panties) and they direct you in. You should take a quick shower to clean up a bit and go to the steam room, it could have been a bit hotter but it was perfectly ok. The black olive oil soap is given upon your entrance to the steam room (take a generous amount) and you can soap yourself or wait for someone to do it for you. Once you are done there, it is scrubbing time, and IT IS AWESOME, they will remove all the impurities and dark thoughts you carry with you. You need to turn and rinse every now and then... the people speak French and basic English but its simple enough, they will point and tell... its a no brainer. Then they will massage you with oils, and pretty strongly too, which is something I really appreciate. The place is not private and you might have a few of your fellow travelers getting massages next to you, but that does not bother me. Besides, this IS NOT A FANCY SPA, it is more similar to traditional hammams. That is it, the whole thing might take a bit over one hour, you might get a longer massage expecting a tip (I will address this in the next parragraph).The place has signs everywhere about the NO TIPPING policy. But regardless you will be asked for tips a couple of times, I have no problem with this if i got a great service, which I did, so I sneaked back in to give the guy a couple EUR. But this is entirely up to you, you will not be harassed or anything. You can now get out and get a tea while you wait for the rest of the people with you. My girl was in fact waiting for me already while sipping some more tea, she had a similarly great experience, it seems that the only thing that really differed was that she got panties and i got a loincloth. We were really happy and will come back for sure."

We're not big spenders and had been put off by some of the high end spas in the city catering chiefly for tourists, but were convinced we'd feel like wallies rocking up to a local hammam and not knowing our ar**s from our elbows (so to speak!). Easy to find right by the Bahia Palace, Hammam Ziani provides the perfect in-between solution. We went for the 350 dh option, including a steam room session, scrub, argan oil massage (1 hr for my friend, 30 mins for me + a mud wrap) and a good wash. The ladies giving us our treatments were wonderful and made us feel like we were in safe hands. Being lead by the hand from room to room, lubed up on argan oil, naked save a pair of tiny paper pants and slopping about in ill-fitting plastic sandals has never been more fun. After we'd dressed and finished giggling about how nice it had all been (I hadn't been washed like that since I was about three) we were shown to a sumptuous sitting area where fresh mint tea awaited us. A seriously nice treat. The most money we'd spend in all our five days in Marrekech, but worth every dirham. (oh and apparently a good scrub, and Hammam Ziani certainly gives you that, means more chances of getting a better tan afterwards - bonus!)"

The Hammam is set up separately for men and women, and the package we got included an amazing Hammam and massage. They also have a \"no tip\" rule which meant there was no hassling at the end, so we both left feeling ridiculously relaxed! Cant recommend this place enough, especially as its such good value"

The girls didn't speak English but that didn't cause any problem and actually added to the experience. There were English speakers available to explain the two pakages they offer. 350 dirham fot the steam, scrub and massage and a mud wrap (or you could have a longer massage). 270 without the wrap.The girl was pleasant and attentive. Lovely massage and I genuinely have never felt as clean as when I left! Not as luxurious as some spas available but definitely excellent value for money."

I had sauna, scrub then a half hour massage then body mud mask for another half hour followed by a hairwash for 350 dirums. Hubby declined the mud mask had extra half hour massage. same price as mine.Female staff for the women male staff for the men.

The price of the full hammam was 270DH which is a very reasonable price considering it last for 1h15! Some of the tourist hammams offer around 650DH for 50mins!.As a darkskinned women I am more than used to the stares and glares but the ladies here were wonderful and gave us the best treatments and massage. The owner went to the extra mile of helping us discover more of the old town on map and explained everything from how to haggle for a camel and also were to go out at night (something our hotel lacked in). Afte our hammams there was a pleasant mint tea awaiting us. The owner and the overall hammam is definately a must we left grinning from ear to ear and thats definately more than expected.

Set between the Bahir and the Badi palaces (not quire sure I've spelled those correctly) we found the Ziani by accident and was that our lucky day. We checked the hammam out before going to the Bahir palace and went to it between palaces. We had previously declined going to another hammam (advertised as reasonably priced by some Trip Advisors please note) because with a massage it would have cost us nearly `1000 dirhams. The Ziani, on the other hand only cost us 270 dirhams with a massage (January) and when I say massage, the one I had by Karim was the best massage I had ever had. I went with a girl friend and we both enjoyed the experience so much so if you are looking for somewhere clean, authentic, very reasonably priced and with lovely friendly staff do get yourself to the Ziani."

Since you go in naked and have other people to wash and scrub you, this could have been uncomfortable, but in fact it was rather nice. The scrub and massage in itself was comfortable (and you got super silky smooth afterwords) but I had a minor clash with the masseurs after they were done. The hammam had a 'no tip policy' but the three ladies that worked there actually begged me to tip them. I didn't really know what to do, and it made me quite uncomfortable.

They fitted us in right away, explained the different options available, and although clearly geared towards tourists it felt fairly authentic to us. The sexes are segregated here, unlike at the more exclusive westerns spas in town, and the scrub I received was one of the best ever. I wasn't asked for a tip by my masseur either, who was really friendly and explained what to do next etc. So for anyone wanting to experience an authentic Moroccan hammam without going fully native, and if you are prepared for it to not be the same as the service you will get in a western spa, then this is a good place for you. I would definitely visit again."

Overall it was worth it, but it could have been better considering the price.Visit: you can take a quick free tour and see into the change room and treatment rooms to get an idea of the warmth & steam. Front desk gentleman during the day was amazingly kind & pleasant. When I went in the evening a different gentleman was not at all polite & simply asked me to pay immediately and then sent me in with a staff member. As a paying customer, that was not appreciated.Pros : Better than most of the other Hammams off the side streets. Others from my Riad went to one suggested by the riad for 200 dirhams, but they were massaged in a cold room and only had a hot shower. Sort of defeats the purpose of the hammam/steam! At least Ziani is warm.Cons: Steam room for relaxing should be hotter. It was warm, but not hot. The service really depends on the attendant you're paired with. My actual treatments were shorter than they should have been. My scrub was only a few minutes at most & not as thorough as it should have been. My massage was rough, not thorough, and definitely not 30 minutes;10-15 minutes maximum. So that was too bad. Another gentleman with another attendant had the same package as me but received a longer more thorough treatment.270 dirhams for basic package (scrub, \"30\" minutes massage, steam, hot showers, body oil). No restricted men vs. Women hours as they're completely separate. Don't need to bring your own undergarments to this hammam as you're given a loin cloth and slippers. Tip:I was given the dark gel to rub into my feet in the hammam. Seriously don't get this anywhere near your eyes OR touch above your neck after. I ran my fingers through my hair and some residue must have leaked onto my face as I sweat : serious stinging.Note: the business posts clearly that tipping is forbidden. I was still repeatedly asked for a tip by my masseuse but i chose to respect the owners' wishesOverall: while it could be better, Ziani is a better option than some of the other spa hammams for 200 dirhams. But, improvement needs to be made to match their claims of being great"

While the women enjoyed their experience, the three men in our group had an awful experience. As others have mentioned, the waiting area is nice, clean and relaxing. However, the men's area is worn, dirty and downright scary. We were supposed to have a hamman and a massage. The hamman consisted of a short steam room visit followed by a series of \"treatments\" and seven showers (we spent more time in the shower than we did getting treatments or a massage). As for the massage, it was the absolute worse massage I have ever received. It was more of a light rub than a massage...and it lasted 10 minutes rather than the promised 30 minute massage After we were done, the guy assigned to me put his hand out looking for a tip despite signs throughout the facility saying \"No tipping\". After refusing his gesture, I quickly made my way to the small and dirty changing room. I saw the same guy poking his head in three times looking to see if I was still there so he could hit me up for a tip. It was a very weird experience and I could not waIt to leave. So, while the ladies in our group had a rather nice time, I can't recommend this hamman given what transpired during my recent visit."

They carry two packages: a hammam experience and an extra experience, that basically gives you 30 minutes extra massage or a clay treatment.We choose the extra experience and paid the 350 dirham for it. The hammam provides you with towels, slippers and a wrap around your waist. So you don't have to bring anything yourself.You start with a cup of Moroccan tea in a waiting area. They pick you up and help you undress and do the waistwrap. Guided to the steam area. First a shower. One out of thee showers broken. Doors made out of old windows with plastic. The hammam is rather cold and that takes away part of the comfort.The guy that was appointed to me to do the treatment didn't speak any English so it was hard to communicate.After a few minutes he picked me up in the steam area for a rubbing. Than back into the shower. He started the massage. But it was anyting but that. Not worthy being called a massage. The clay treatment means a few lines of clay on your body, aprox 30 minutes wrapped under a plasic sheet and they poor hot water over you from time to time.Back into the shower to get the clay off, being washed with soap, and shower again. And that was it. And than the begging began: give me money sir. You bring money? You give to me. There are signs all over \"No tipping\" but the staff doesn't care.In the end we got an extra cup of tea. When the owner asked how it was and I responded that is was merely okay, he said \"good\" and walked away. That was it. We both had a simmular experience. So go here for the experience. Not for a good massage nor a proper clay treatment."

When she said she didnt have any money, the lady said \"you must have something\". Now, that's pretty standard in Morocco BUT the hamann has signs everywhere saying \"no tipping allowed\" so we hadnt taken any extra money with us.

There were lockers available in the changing rooms.After undressing, a woman took my hand and ushered me into the steam bath, where 4 other women were already sitting. You couldn't see anything, because the room was full of steam. While I was sitting there, new women were lead in and others were picked up. It seemed to be very busy. I waited approximately for half an hour until a woman, who just spoke french, came to pick me up. She took my hand and brought me into a room where 4 other massagebeds stood. She scubbed me with the the typical Hammam massage glove, washed off the skin with soap and rinsed me with water. It took 5 minutes, if not less. Then I was put back in the steam bath. It was even more crowded now, we had to squeeze together. After another half an hour I was taked out again, now into the massageroom. The massage, which was included contained a 5 minutes \"massage\" where argan oil was just rubbed in a little. Afterwards I was taken back into the steam bath, where they put a seaweedpaste on me and wraped me in a transparentfoil. Now I had to lay on the hard stonebench for approximately 40 minutes! Then someone brought me into the bathingroom again. Put soap on me and rinsed me with water. Then I had to go get changed. Then we could take a tea.Altogether: I spent most of the time waiting in the steambath, everything else was just done really quick. It felt like being on the assembly line!

Over several visits to Marrakech during the past 5 years I have tried countless locations to find a true Marrakchi experience. Well, this is IT! For the boys, if you like soft towels, a dark room and a pretty girl for your massage, do not come here, you will hate it. (I cannot speak for how the ladies are treated as this is a seperate area at Ziani). However, if you are looking to enter a world with a large dose of the real Hammam culture, are not shy of your body and are OK laying on a marble slab next to a complete stranger enjoying the same experience, then you should come here. You are met by a very pleasant multi lingual guy at reception, which you must pay up front. Don't worry, you will not be disappointed. You are then stripped naked, given a peice of blue cotton to cover your essentials and pulled directly into the steam & massage area. A quick shower, you are then soaped fully (and perhaps intimately for some people) and led into a very authentic domed steam room with only natural light through small glazed holes around the dome. A very pleasant experience.Followed by copious amounts of showers, soapings, scrubbings and a massage of between 30-60 minutes by a mostly naked bloke (except for his own white cotton loin cloth) with hands like shovels - it is just great! For the Rolls Royce version it is a very modest 350Dhs, some 3 times cheaper than any hotel spa, for a standard treatment it's 270Dhs. I left the Ziani feeling squeaky clean, relaxed and ready for the day. I will definitely be returning. Do not get tempted by sellers in the street pulling you elsewhere or taxi drivers who want to take you to the Kasbah for the more 'fashionable bains' - Like Bains de Marrakech or Bains d'Alhambra. You will get a private room for the massage and a pretty girl at these places but you will pay a lot more and you will miss the excellent ambiance and experience of Ziani. See you soon guys!!"

They also shampooed our hair.Not a 'high end' place, but cheaper than a lot of the other tourist aimed hammams, and a pleasant experience."

If you want a cheap local hammam this isn't it, a bit over priced. Over produced. And for the middle aged guy to steamy to see over the rim of my glasses :) to get around. A traditional hammam is the way to go. Ask the person who runs your Riad or Hotel where the locals go."

People smile at you and you feel at peace (especially in comparison to the chaotic rhythms of the Medina itself).As per the treatment - I was expecting much more!! I decided to go for the full massage package (steam room with soaping, scrubbing, 1/2 hour massage + extra 1/2 hour for 70 dirhams more). I was escorted in the massage/shower/steam area by a smiley guy who didn't speak a word of English. He made me shower first (in a really grimy and shabby box) then he took me to the steam room. The room was cold - the steam came on only after 5 good minutes. Just 5 minutes later (not enough to get proper warm) he came to pick me up for the soaping, scrubbing, oiling treatment. These didn't last more than 10 minutes in total. Then he started the massage; Pleasant but nothing more than a gentle stroke who anyone could perform. No longer than 30 minutes (I paid for a full hour massage) and he told me to shower again and go back to the changing room. On my way out he asked me for tip (even though everywhere in the hammam is written NO TIPS! in all languages) which I obviously gave him as after a few hours in Marrakech you understand there is no other choice but to tip everyone if you don't won't to be pestered.The Hammam finishes with a refreshing cup of mint tea in the main lounge. Again, nice but no wows here! Overall just an average experience. Tired facility, pleasant but not professional workers, a bit dirty. Not sure I would recommend it, especially the full hour massage."

My tour leader and my riad desk clerk set me up with the Hamman Ziani. I was used to American massages, but I didn't know what to expect in a Moroccan hammam. It turned out to be a very enjoyable experience, exceeding my expectations. After directing me to a shower and a 5-minute steam room stay, a young man treated me to a very sensual massage. He had me lie down on a table that was covered with an oil cloth and used a liberal amount of body oil on me. Afterward he soaped me up to get as much of the oil off as possible and directed me back to the shower to complete the process. It was one of the best massages I've ever had and made me wish I could have one like it in the U.S. It truly was the icing on the cake. I would go back in a heartbeat if I ever return to Morocco (which is a wonderful country to visit if you've never been there)."

One of our friends had experienced a hammam previously, two of us had not. We were a bit anxious about going, but our previously experienced friend urged us to partake. When in Morocco, do as the Moroccans do! Our tour guide (Khalid) suggested this hammam to us and we were not disappointed. The whole experience was quite unnerving for me initially but once the whole process began I relaxed and enjoyed the experience. I've never felt so clean or pampered, all of the women who take care of us were remarkable...the one who gave me a massage was great! I would definitely do it again...it was very reasonably priced...a similar treatment here in the states would have easily been $200+."

Anyone who is disappointed with this fantastic place should go on to sample either a ridiculously expensive massage in a boutique hotel or the extremely basic facilities in a traditional public hammam. This place strikes a wonderful balance; the building has traditional features but the massage is not the tradiitonal rough manipulation but rather a firm but relaxing massage as good as any I have had anywhere. I went three times during the week, it was so reasonably priced!; all three therapists I encountered were well trained and accomplished. On my final visit I was joined by a friend and his 14 year-old nephew while our two female companions headed into their section. We emerged buffed and glowing and all agreed that we had been treated to a memorably enjoyable experience. Thank you Hammam Ziani!"

We did see the inside and we decided to come back the next day as promised, but the guy who showed us inside was not on duty at that time. For once in my life , I felt like a royalty; a very nice and sweet lady always smiling gave me a complete bath scrubbing my whole body and whole bodyassace with oil and the sauna room was really awesome! I really liked the different small holes with different colors reflecting on you! I meant to give a good tip to the lady when I walked in the front desk to ask to give the tip to the lady, the owner said \"NO TIP\" because they get at least 65% of the fee you paid! The owner, Ziani said the best thing I can give is to write the review instead! But I'm willing to write the review anyway! Thanks for the wonderful service at Hammam Ziani!

We both decided on the \"standard\" package which was 270DH (~ 33.75USD). A bit high for a hammam but this is a \"Luxury\" place, so hey, why not. Plus, the owner pointed out that they have an explicit no tipping policy as they factor it all in to the price, a policy confirmed by the presence of signs posted almost everywhere in 4 different languages stating \"No Tipping\", a bit odd for Morocco but ok, great!Dropped some things off at the Road and came back for hammam. Upon return, the owner was out but that was fine. I paid for us both, 600DH, got back 50DH and was told they had to go make change and would give me the other 10DH when I got out, no worries. The Hammam itself was amazing, really really great. Awesome steam room, 3 rounds of black soap scrub/exfoliate/massage with cool shower in between. Absolutely incredible for 1.25hrs, I felt great!Upon leaving but before getting dressed, when were both in nothing but barely a half towel, however, my guy stopped me and whispered \"mister, may I have a little tip for me?\" All of a sudden what was an amazing experience got really uncomfortable. I looked at him confused and slowly shook my head and pointed to the signs and said \"I can't, there's signs everywhere.\" He whispered \"yes I know but please just a little.\" And I still shook my head no pointing to the signs. That's a -1 right there. Then he held a finger to his lips and whispered \"ok but shhhh, please not tell I ask for tip\". Super awkward. That's another -1.Got dressed, went out and had some tea while waiting for my wife. Upon leaving I didn't even ask for my remaining 10DH. I feel like the whole situation wouldn't have even happened if the boss was there. A brief chat with my wife afterwards confirmed a similar experience, albeit not so aggressive and secretive.Overall it was an amazing experience that was really soured in the end. I have no problem tipping and its generally the Moroccan way to tip for everything, but this place is very explicit about not doing so, especially since I was asked to keep it quiet that he even asked."

My wife and I were looking for a genuine hammam experience, after having a great one in our hotel (kenzi farah)...I researched lots if them and settled for Ziani...which I'm pleased about...We asked our taxi driver to take us here, and he tried to talk us out of it, and recommend a better one, as apparently Ziani didn't offer massages!We insisted that we knew what we were doing and didn't want to go anywhere else but here...he reluctantly agreed.As you enter, we were greeted by an enthusiastic guy, who showed us how the experience would map out, I was shown the men's area and my wife had a lady showing her the female area.I paid 700dhm for both of us and the experience began.I was given a sarong, and walked through to the sauna...left for a few minutes until a guy came in and started putting black gel soap on me...all the guys spoke good English, he did this and then I was left for about 10 mins...then taken to a marble block and scrubbed...soooooo good...all the dead skin...so much even thought I'd had a scrub the day before!Then a shower and massage...I could have had a seaweed wrap, but opted for an extended massage.Great experience...once it was all over I showered and went back out for nice mint tea...and relaxing.My wife had the same experience although she opted for the seaweed wrap...and apparently the women are given small disposable underwear.I have to admit, this was great...a really good experience in a hammam that must be only a couple of decades old...However..the massage, although good, did not surpass the amazing one I had at the hotel.Definitely go here as top of the list of hammam to visit..."

I've used spas in the UK and been to Turkish baths but nothing prepared me for this.

I was told no tips but the masseuse did ask for a tip and feeling sorry for him did give something for his effort as I felt this probably make a large part of their salary.

            "review": "Very good first time hamam experience!. Hamam Ziani was the first hamam I experienced, ever. I went to a handful during my time in Morocco and I think this was the best place to start. In my opinion, it was geared toward tourists but at a very reasonable in price. 270 Diram for a steam, massage, and scrub. The whole thing was about 1.5 hours. I love spas, spa treatments, massages, scrubs etc. and like a good deal. This was good and a good deal. You start with a lady who takes you to a locker room. I was wary of leaving my things in the locker, but they gave me the key to carry around with me and I just went with the flow of things. There are lots of detailed reviews about what exactly happens - but essentially a very warm and welcoming lady will take you from station to station, and you will be met by another lady who will tell you to sit, stand, lay down, turn over, etc while they work their magic. While I like the whole thing, the scrub really stands out. I mean they scrub you, every bit of you, and remove the top layer of skin. The scrub was actually more gentle here than at more traditional local hamams and still made me out-of-this world soft and smooth. Pros:1. Warm, welcoming staff. I was as comfortable as possible, being led around to the stations, having buckets of water poured on me, or being told to climb onto a big, slippery massage table in front of several other ladies - and with not much on!2. Great scrub without being too harsh or being to tentative. Perfect for your first hamam experience. Love that squeaky clean feeling.3. Very relaxing lounge, with good attention to detail. Hot tea, lotions, and a hair dryer were available at the end. I have long hair, and really appreciated the hair dryer. 4. Felt pampered - so much that I went back for another round just before we left Marrakesh5. Everybody has the same covering, provided by the hammam. (in more traditional ones you go with your own undergarments, which can be awkward if you are not prepared!)Cons:1. Men have a very different experience - less relaxing, and much more awkward. My BF got hit on (he didn't think it was as funny as I did!) but his massage guy told him he was \"very sexy\" and \"I like you\" over and over. 2. The men's tipping situation is a bit much - on my side, the lady was more discrete. But on the men's side, they sat there with their hand out and asked \"tip...? tip....?!\"If not for the men's section, I would give it 5 stars. Tips:1. I didn't think the additional seaweed wrap did much for me; not worth it. I would rather come back and do the normal package twice for a bit more.2. Make a late evening appointment - less crowded and you will probably be tired from exploring all day. 3. Don't eat just before you go; give yourself at least an hour or so to digest since you will be laying on your stomach, and flipping over several times.4. Be prepared for the lack of covering - on yourself and everybody else5. The front desk guy speaks English, but many of the ladies don't. Just follow them, the answers to whatever questions you have will be obvious soon enough."

Arrived inside to a sweet cup of mint tea! Lush red velvet sofas and fossils in the walls. My wife went off for a quite relaxing hamman. My three boys and I went into the men's Hamman. Great fun as four men guided us through steam room, lit with blue and yellow light beams through the domed roof. Then a body scrub to scrape away the dirt from our journey. Slowly the stress of arrival was massaged away, whilst one of the guys entertained my two year old with water play, and gentle massage. Ending with an almond wash. Inigo chilled out completely and the souk and busy streets no longer worried him. Otto however laughed the whole way through, didn't realise how ticklish he was! Thanks for looking after us, all the best Jonathan (by the way only 270 dirhams each, Ruben was free!)"

They had a lovely waiting room with plenty of moroccan tea to relax you whilst you wait before being taken to the baths. The normal deal is 270 dirhams which pays for scrubbing, a massage, robes, disposable underwear and such. For 350 dirhams you got to be slathered in seaweed mix and wrapped up in plastic (quite unnerving when I first saw someone lying like that - looked a bit like a body bag...) We opted for the more expensive option, how often do you get to do a moroccan hammam?I have to say. They give you sarongs to put on to cover your modesty but this is removed pretty much as soon as you go into the baths so don't get too attached to it. Throughout the experience I may as well have been totally naked which, normally around my best friend and around total strangers I would not be okay with, for some reason in this setting I felt pretty comfortable.The overall experience felt like I was assaulted by large women who I couldn't understand, scrubbed raw, oiled up, slathered in some dark stuff and then wrapped up in plastic to steam. Generally quite confusing but it was great, I felt so relaxed after and my skin was so smooooooth.Definitely not for the faint-hearted but worth a go if you want a good hammam experience!"

Have wanted to have a go at this for a few years now and it was a great experience.Friendly introduction with a tour of the Hammam and free Berber tea prior to us making up our minds. I'm male and the females do have a slightly different experience (so I'm told by the wife!) but just as good.You are allocated a member of staff who makes sure you cover all of the steps so don't worry about not knowing what to do. Hang your modesty up at the door. They do not recommend using bathing trunks as the oils stain these and they provide you with a sarong to cover your bits. You were also allocated a locker for your possessions which was fine. The whole experience lasted just short of 2 hours. Initially you have a shower, followed by a steam (sitting higher gives more heat and they did ask whether I wanted it cool or hot and more steam was added) with an initial soaping, the steam room was an old domed building with covered holes in the ceiling to let light in, seemed quite authentic. I would have preferred longer in the steam room but I guess they need to get people through the lengthy process.I then took a further shower before the \"black soap\" and baby mitt were used to get rid of surface grime and muck. This is like being scrubbed with a light scouring pad! but it does ensure that you are thoroughly clean.Then follows another shower before your top to toe (literally) massage, they don't miss anything. I've had a couple of massages before which haven't done much for me really but this was the first time I've had a male masseur and there is definitely a difference, much better from a personal perspective, really got into the muscles.After the lengthy massage there is a further soaping down with what smelled like almond oils and plenty of foam, prior to a final shower.Like others, although I was told that there was no tipping I was asked, and the chap did stand just outside the changing room whilst I rummaged around trying to find change which was a little awkward.The next day we were walking past the Hammam again, and when we said that we had been in the day before we were offered to go in for free Berber tea again, which I thought was very excellent customer service.Overall a really good experience, and I would use them again, but not perfect."

We'd heard from some who had patronized other hammams that the traditional scrub could be quite vigorous, that the steam could be too warm, etc., so we asked many questions of the owner (excellent English) before we committed. It was a worthwhile two hours of relaxation and a refreshing cultural experience. The Hammam Zania is just off the Place des Ferblantiers, but is not difficult to find from most points in the medina. We would definitely visit again."

The staff are thorough with all the treatments (soap,exfoliation,buffing, washing) and as for the massage...it is 40 minutes or so of utter bliss.

The steam room never quite was hot enough, there were three beds in each massage bay meaning you must negotiate your way around the other clients and masseuses as you take the frequent trips to the showers. On the cool side which isn't great when you're trying to relax and a bit dark & steamy, but not in a comforting way. For most of the time the music wasn't playing so the only sounds were shuffling bodies, scrubbing, muffled Arabic voices and the sounds from the street outside. The scrubbing and massage cover a full 98% of the body, so this is no place to be if you're prudish. On the plus side, the whole place is clean, the showers are past their prime but they work perfectly well and the front of house staff we very welcoming and helpful. There are secure lockers for which you keep the key. In the moments when you feel comfortable enough to relax the scrub and massage are good and \"thorough\", but don't expect a comparable level of relaxation that you might experience from a spa massage. The \"no tips\" policy displayed on numerous signs did not prevent my masseuse from inviting me to compliment on the experience in the corridor and hassling me \"for a small chip\" on the way out, then hanging around the entrance to the changing area whilst I opened my locker for money. Awkward!!"

One of them had found out about this through Trip Advisor and it sounded like what we wanted. We didn't fancy braving the public hammams and even though our hotel had a Clarins Spa in it - we wanted to try something authentic. Make sure you plan your route before leaving your hotel as you will be hassled if it looks like you are lost. We stopped once to consult our map and \"the most trustworthy guy in Marrakech\" told us that it was shut. We decided that we would carry on and another shop keeper directed further down the road to it. It's opposite a car park which is a good marker to keep an eye out for! The owner speaks good English and lets you have a little look around before you make a decision. This was a Christmas treat from one of my friends so I'm not sure on price but we went for the scrub and wrap. They give you a bag which has a sarong and disposable knickers and you can lock your belongings away - some of the lockers have seen better days so we all put our stuff in one locker in the end. You walk through the door and the steam hits you - your sarong is whipped away and you are basically naked so make sure you are with good friends! In the womens' section you are guided about by big motherly-type ladies who direct you about - they are not phased by anything! You get washed, steamed, scrubbed, massaged, wrapped, and washed again. The steam room (and also where you lay in your wrap) is a beautiful domed room. We went on a Monday around 12pm - it wasn't busy but as I was laying in my wrap a group of ladies did have to step around me to sit on the seats - however I think it was more awkward for them clambering over me with disposable knickers on!! The final wash and shampoo could have been a bit longer - however its with Argon oil (I think that's right!) which leaves you feeling super soft for the rest of the day. My hair was silky smooth as well which I didn't expect.Overall this place is a good place for tourists to visit to get a lovely relaxing experience - I would recommend it!"

If it wasn't for him the experience may have been very different. However......Steam room was steamy however felt quite cold, and don't let them take you out from it after only a minute, give yourself a good 8-10 minutes.Showers were in same room as the people getting massaged, quite a distraction.Showers started with a dribble and didn't get much better, didn't even get hotter than luke warm.Woman get beautifully doused in warm water from their masseuse, men just take a shower.If it's busy you could have 3 other people getting massaged in the same room with you. There are two rooms close to each other so total of 8 people. There isn't even enough room to walk around the massage tables like this so it would get quite cosy and I would say, far from relaxing.The room for the massage and scrub is right next to the steam room and as a result these rooms are very humid and steamy too, and just a little cold as well.Oh, and one last thing, changing facilities were a bit uncomfortable. There was an enclave with lockers and a bench. Not so bad, however if you were stood in the wrong place then I'm sure that people at reception would see you. And when I was finished there was a very dodgy guy just sitting at the entrance monitoring things....a little weird and uncomfortable. In total, if you go knowing all this and not expecting more I'm sure you will enjoy, after all the place seemed clean enough and the masseuse seemed to know what they were doing. If you expect better then walk on by....."

It's not an upscale luxury spa, but you know that because of the prices, there are no illusions about this. It's also not a public hamman, but you know this too because of how it's advertised. This is exactly why we chose it! We wanted the 'public experience' but not the awkwardness of 'are we doing it right?', 'can we sit there?', which can take away from enjoying it and we didn't want to go to a spa, we can do that anywhere. It seemed like it would be the perfect balance and it was.We went mid-morning and there were only a handful of other women, my boyfriend was only with one other man on his side. You get soaped up, rinsed off and sit in the steam room (could have been a little hotter), then scrubbed, massaged (this was really fantastic, she was strong and it was like a deep tissue massage) and I opted for the clay wrap (covered in clay and wrapped in plastic in the steam room for about 20 mins, then shampooed. There were two locals there bathing, the women who worked there were friendly, they even sang a little bit, held my hand everywhere I went so I didn't slip and made it a great experience. My boyfriend had a nice experience too, although he was asked for a tip, even though it clearly says not to give tips. This and the steam room could have been hotter are my only complaints. The guy who runs it is very nice and genuine and told us about some places to go afterward, very helpful."

            "review": "Enjoyable experience, reasonably priced. After being rinsed down I was left in the steam room to relax, then into another room for the scrub and rinse, the third room for massage, then back to the scrub room to be washed including hairwash. As we entered, another customer leaving, asked me how much I had paid - when I told her we paid the advertised price, she commented that we could have bargained the price down (didn't occur to me as it was a set pricelist, however I was happy with the amount we paid as it was a fraction of the cost of any similar treatment at home).The ladies' side is traditional, with attoendants pouring water over you but my son reported that on the men's side, you just get under a shower - the men's side also has just the two treatment rooms, one for steam and the other for the scrub the massage and the shower. It was a relaxing experience, and we came out feeling squeaky clean.As commented by another reviewer previously, we were also handed baskets with fluffy towels and robes etc as we entered the hammam and these were whisked away quite quickly, not to be seen again. However we were provided with a dry robe and towel at the appropriate time and the attendants have all the products they need on hand. I am not particularly bothered whether the contents of the basket are themselves actually used, but feel it is an unnecessary step to provide customers with a basket if it is only for show. Once you hit the changing rooms you are given some disposable undies, plastic sandals and a cotton wrap that you only wear for the few steps walk into the steam room. You put your clothes in a locker, and the key on elastic band stays on your wrist throughout. The wrap is taken away within 2 minutes of you putting it on, and the rest of the visit takes place wearing the paper pants and the sandals. Be careful as the floors are very slippery, At times you are sloshing through an inch or two of water in the plastic sandals they provide for you to wear, but the attendants keep a firm grip on you as you're escorted from room to room. There are male attendants for men, and women attendants for women. There is a small lounge area to rest after your treatment and mint tea is available there - I noticed a hairdryer and mirror there too in case you don't want to walk back to your Riad with wet hair as we did, but these would have been better placed in the changing rooms.An enjoyable experience."

We were each given a basket with what looked to be a nice fresh (dry) robe and towel. After I changed I never actually saw this basket of things again. I was handed a fairly damp scruffy robe and towel at the end and the basket with the rolled up fresh looking items was no where to be seen. I just wonder if it went back to the front display and I was given some not as nice looking.... It just made me think if the baskets at the front were just for show and then taken away to be replaced by the 'not so nice' robe and towel???? I did see anothe comment that might suggest a similar experience. It was nice that tips were included but my friend was actually asked for a tip on the mens side, but since he knew it was meant to be included he refused..... Still ...I would go back and perhaps make sure the basket of dry and clean towel and robe was available at the end."

She was understandably a little apprehensive about the semi-nudity, but this did not last long. The women treating us were so friendly and put her at ease. The hammam was very busy during this visit, so the pace of treatments was a little slower than previous visits, yet we never felt like we were left alone for too long. Nor were we rushed through any treatments. Definitely a fab place to relax and be pampered. Only thing that was lacking this time was mint tea at the end or someone available to ask for some. We just ended up sort of leaving!!! However, looking forward to my next visit in Feb 2014."

It's so good, I've been back.This is more of a authentic hamman compared to the many supposedly luxury spas and hammans in Marrakech.The owner speaks many different languages and is more than happy for you to have a look around without any pressure to purchase treatments.If you're uncomfortable with semi nudity in front of strangers, this isn't the place for you as all treatments take place in communal areas (separate areas for ladies and men)You'll be provided with everything you need, paper pants (I take my own bikini bottoms) sandals, modesty wrap (it's not on for long) towels, bath robes and lockers.Unlike other hammans, you'll be charged a price that includes tips for the staff, so you'll not be pressured into tipping (which can sometimes spoil the experience, especially if you're unsure how much to tip)The staff here couldn't be sweeter. The take great efforts to make sure you're comfortable, and genuinely look after you rather than some of the fake efforts I've experienced In the so called luxury spas as it's aimed at generating tips.Packages include, black soap wash, steam, scrub, massage and mud wraps. The top package includes all of the treatments and takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes all for 3500 dirhams which is exceptional value.You'll be given time to relax after your treatment with some mint tea, hair dyers are available too.You'll leave relaxed and scrubbed within an inch if your life.One of my favourite places in Marrakech, don't miss it.Make sure you take time to pet the owners cute dogs, Linda and Emily. Linda loves the attention."

Before visiting the city, we had decided we wanted to do the Hammam Spa experience, but had read a few reviews of people having poor experiences, for one reason or another. We'd read about Hammam Ziana, and tried finding it, as per the location shown on this Tripadvisor app....NOTE: the location on the app is not correct by a long way! We had to do a google map search in the end.....after a \"friendly local\" who could see we were lost, offered to show us as he was going that way. He didn't, he lead us in a block then asked for money. Lesson learnt! However, once we'd found it, it was so worth the effort. We found it clean, welcoming and no pressure at all to book a treatment. The owner is more than pleased to just show you around and leave you in the relaxation room with a cup of tea. We decided to book the top package, which was 350 Dirhams each. We both found the treatments excellent, relaxing and outstanding value for money. Thank you so much."

            "review": "Great experience but a bit awkward at times. This was a great Hammam and I would go there again. I had the 'super package' for 350MAD . On the super package you get the wash, the steam, the massage and the mudwrap and you definitely come out feeling super clean and chilled. It is incredible good value - under half the price of the spa in my Marrakesh hotel and probably a third of the UK price for the spa equivalent here. That said it is a hammam not a spa, you do need to be comfortable with public near nudity (gender separated but still public). The changing area is private and there is a secure locker to leave your things. You are given a pair of 'micro knickers' to wear, some plastic shoes and a wrap to walk into the hammam itself but once you are in there the wrap is taken away and as both the hammam ladies were busy I was left standing there a while feeling a little self conscious before my lady came to take me for my wash. Once you get started it is better and after the wash you are led to the steam room and left to relax for a while before the scrub. As others have said, the scrub is amazing and scary how much skin comes away! I had the same lady for all my treatments and she was very good, I have a shoulder injury which I explained to her about (in French, I don't think she spoke English, although I didn't try) and she was very careful to make sure that she didn't do anything to hurt it. the massage was excellent and helped ease out my aches and pains from the Camel ride a couple of days earlier, the warp was also good although getting up on to a marble slab covered with plastic when you have just had an oily massage is definitely tricky!I would definitely go back and would recommend Hammam Ziani but there were a couple of things that have stopped me giving this 5 stars. The first is that we popped by the previous day to make sure we knew where it was and decided we might as well book for the next day as we didn't have time to go ahead right then. The man on the desk (not Ziani) asked for a 100MAD deposit which I thought was unjustified as we were booking for a quiet time (early afternoon) and most people just turn up, also we weren't asking them to reserve anything for us - I've never been asked for a deposit for a beauty type service before and I thought it was a bit off.The other disappointment was that I was expecting the full Turkish bath type arrangement, with a series of 3 interconnecting dry hot rooms as well as a steam room, Hammam Ziani doesn't have any dry hot rooms, just the steam room.In summary though, great experience, good value for money compared with the Spa equivalent and a must do, especially if you have been foolish enough to go on a Camel ride :-)"

At Zaini you go into a shower where the water drips out! it was very disappointing, it was no different to having a normal shower! Suffice to say I wont be going back unless they improve their operation."

The owner is very welcoming and even provides a tour of the hamman, but the best part is he doesn't make you feel obliged to pay for a massage after it. Be aware it is very hard to find!!! Tripadvisor directions are wrong and led us to a different place, which is not even a hammam but a spa. Also as Hammam Ziani don't pay commission to the local Moroccans like other establishments they will be less willing to show you where it is. It is on Rue Riad Zitoun el Jdid and keep walking until you come to a car park. It is directly opposite it with the doorway right on the main road. I had the full package and the extra price was well worth it, getting extra time in the hammam and an hour long massage, absolute bliss. Couldn't recommend it enough!"

However on taking a walk in the Medina, I passed by Hammam Ziani. The owner Ziani was by the doorway welcoming clients and he talked me through the experience. He also gave tips about Morocco on a whole even offering us the local tea even though we were not having a hammam at that precise time. I told him that I would be back and I am so glad that I kept my word, it was a fantastic experience and I have been recommending this place ever since. On entry, you get offered some local tea and then I was taken to the female section of the hammam. I took the super package which included the hammam and mud bath. I was first rubbed down in oil and taken to the steam room, then got scrubbed, massaged and after rubbed with mud and wrapped swaddle- like for some time so that it could all be soaked in. After I was bathed and got my hair shampooed. The staff were wonderful and treated everyone really well. The most amazing part of the experience was the full body massage as my limbs felt like jelly after. I was soooo chilled and relaxed.The overall time was probably an hour and a half and it was so relaxing it seemed longer. I left there feeling as if I were floating and my mind and body were totally relaxed.I will definitely go there again and am not tempted to try anywhere else after this amazing experience. They have repeat customers also as another European tourist told me that this was her third time there. Apparently, everytime she travels to morocco she goes there....and I thought to myself..yep that will be me :-)"

The owner, Ziani was most helpful in explaining the routine and also, afterwards, where we could go to buy products or enjoy great Moroccan cuisine. There was no pressure to buy and tips included in the price, so no pressure there either. We got the 350dh full package and it was worth every cent. The ladies on staff were good at their job and kind. You can tell they really care about giving you a memorable experience and they are not rough. The scrub was good, the massage was exactly the right pressure and the clay wrap was so Devine I nearly fell asleep. I have been to a public Hannam while in Morocco and that is a totally different experience. This is luxury. I also visited hammam Ziani in Casablanca and while it was a great experience too, I liked the Marrakech spa better.

A lot of people on here seemed to be expecting a high end western spa for some unknown reason...The guy on the desk was a little pushy with the packages, we were sure we didn't want the scrub (my girlfriend was worried about the harshness) just the massage etc. We were led to through the various stages, where to undress, where to store our clothes etc.The steam room/sauna was fine, quite warm near the top and not so at the bottom if its not your thing you can sit low. The massage guy was very nice and the massage was nice, not too firm as to be painful. You then get a scrub afterwards which was nice. I'd probably recommend this as being more rewarding after a day of walking around then early like we did it. Still nice though.The massage went for quite a while, definitely more than the 30 mins we paid for. After which I was shown where to get dressed etc. I was NOT asked for a tip or even alluded to one at any stage by any staff member and neither was my girlfriend.Overall I'd recommend it, none of our stuff went missing as I've heard with other hammams, no bill variations and the people were nice. The place is super wet and slippery so make sure you wear the shoes they give you and take your time moving from room to room. I think the place was pretty clean, with all the water/soap/oil/steam you're hard pressed to see more than a few feet in front so people claiming it to be dirty must have better eyes than me.I'd agree if you're not comfortable with nudity/personal space it might not be for you. While during our session you weren't nude at all, just a towel/apron thing they do get quite close to certain areas during the massage which can feel a little weird! (Guys do guys, women do women) so guys, don't think you're getting a girl like Thailand/Bali etc. There was nothing dodgy though, everything above board etc so I had no problem with it and if you read up on Hammams you should already know this, might catch walk-in tourists off guard though.Overall, great way to spend an hour or more, whichever suits!"

I originally planned to come here with my husband as I am an avid fan of hammams, especially if nude, as I have been raised going to Korean bath houses since I was a child. After reading reviews of pretty much being nude and having the best massages, I had to give it a go. The bonus is that Hammam Ziani is very easy to find as it is on the same street as the Palace Bahia, which was a bonus as it was not far from our riad. We first arrived on Saturday 21 Sept before 8pm. It was relatively quiet. We were greet warmly and immeditately given a tour despite saying it's ok we want to go in for sure. They were persistent so we don't get disappointed. My husband LOVED it. He had ZAGHIB (a slim man with glasses) and said despite it being powerful, he felt so relaxed and as if all his muscles and joints from our first two days of intense trips were all set in the right place again. Apparently, the men's section was virtually empty. I was led to the female room and it was pretty busy. If I recall they have 5 or 6 massage tables and three tables for scrubbing and bathing. I was bathed quickly and led to the hammam where one woman was. At first it was wonderful until nearly 25min later I am still there in the cold, with no steam, and clearly forgotten. Later I am fetched and scrubbed, but it was so gentle and with the steam long gone, my skin was not easily shedding. Next was the massage, which was very disappointing. Everything was on a set time and there was no focus on my aching feet or back. The back massage was painful and just that. After it finished, I was in more pain than when I came in. At the end, I was so disappointed and terrfied my husband had the same experience. I was wrong, thank goodness!What made it better is the willingness of the manager to get me to come back as my husband wanted to. I said I would go elsewhere while he went to Ziani. Instead, I was convinced to come back as I was told that I would be given a 30min massage for free. We missed our appointment on the following Monday due to a terrible day trip, but they easily re-scheduled us for our last day before our flight. I was given a great price to make up for the disappointment and my husband again was happy. He opted both times for the 350 Dirhams package. Our second time he has HASSAN. He said he was not powerful like Zaghib but was so detailed. He spent time on each aching point that my husband again was in heaven. What was consistent is the fact that both of his guys were very attentive and knew exactly where to massage more. It was busy again on the women's side, but this time it was better! ADIJA (sp?) is a young, round woman who bathed me properly making sure I was clean and lathered up before leading me to the hammam. I was given time in the hammam in the glorious steam. Adija came to get me and when she scrubbed. WOW! It was a massage and scrub in one. I would say she would be the female version of Zaghib with power. Literally my back that was hurting cracked when she scrubbed me and I felt so relieved! Plus the fact I was there for a second time and a lot of skin was scrubbed off means my first time was a waste. Afterwards, I was escorted by FATIMA, an older lady, who is supposed to be one of the best. She is the female version of Hassan. My hour massage with her was very relaxing. Maybe I could have done with more power, but with the amount of stress I face, I'd be in pain from all the reflexology. Instead, Fatima was so attentive and got so deep in my tissues that I felt relaxed. I wasn't cracked into place but I was massaged enough to feel relaxed, which is a difficult thing to do. Overall, I'd go to Ziani again. On our last day, we met Ziani. He lived in San Francisco for some time. I am from LA so that was a conversation starter. The best part though is when I told him of the night before and how I bonded with two of his dogs. When I mentioned them by name, his smile lit up and he asked me if I'd like to see puppies! YES! He truly loves his dogs. We were led to the back where I was immediately tackled by his friendly dogs and the cutest puppies ever. Marrakech is beautiful but I think Ziani's dogs made my trip because the puppies were too cute. My husband, who has allergies, even admitted that the puppies warmed his heart. Wonderful service from management. If you choose to go, for women request Fatima (if your muscles need relaxing) or Adija (if you really want to be cracked into place). For men, request Zaghib (like Adija) or Hassan (like Fatima).In all honesty for 350 Dirhams (\u00a326) is a wonderful price. You are given a bathrobe and necessary items. Also it comes with hammam, scrubbing, 30min massage, 30min seasweed wrap, and washing. Instead of the seaweed wrap you can opt to extend your massage to a full hour."

Decided to experience it and wow - it was probably the best thing we did during our long weekend in lovely Marrakech. The owner is charming, very helpful and speaks fluent English. The experience was superb. We had the full treatment consisting of wash, scrub, steam and massage and it was nice for the 3 of us to have at the same time. It really was a superb experience - felt like I had died and gone to heaven. A really good value experience - 270 drms (about \u00a320) each. Worth every penny. Don't be tempted by the 'spas' that you see around - this is a genuine hamman which is better."

Blokes strip off completely, apart from a little wrap around skirt thing, so be warned - you should not be squeamish about being near-on naked. First of all, one of the attendants washes you down with some black soap, and then you go into the sauna for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, you are taken to have a quick shower, and then the treatment begins! You lie down on a table where you are scrubbed to within an inch of your life (gommage), with barely a square inch being left unscrubbed (again, having any hang-ups about getting up close and personal will seriously interfere with the experience!). After a complete layer of skin has been shred, another shower follows, followed by a massage. The package costs 270 dh (about \u00a330), and ends with a glass of mint tea in a peaceful sitting area, which is good as I could hardly stand afterwards, and slept for 3 hrs when I got back to my hotel! I would definitely go back again if I visited Marrekech"

I didn't think it looked so clean. From the filthy rug at the entrance, to the shower doors, walking in pools of water, a bit crowded, etc. No private rooms here, all community rooms. I didn't like that the massage guys were all talking and shouting with each other while people were getting massages. No quiet peaceful music, just a lot of talking. Kind of annoying. When you walk to/from the showers, you literally have to bump into someone's feet getting massaged. Not spacious at all. The scrubbing and massage were quite good, I suppose the price is reasonable, but I prefer something more luxurious, more like a spa rather than a public hamman."

Ziani very welcoming and homely, guided us into his darkened fragrant abode with promises of mint tea which he did deliver. We were made to feel very relaxed, no pressure at all, we just soaked up the wonderful sensory pleasure of the lounge area and given our slippers, towels and robes and locker keys. Ziani's dogs are sweet and I am not a dog person but they took to me instantly. We settled on the full package costing 350 dirhams. His staff do not speak English and my French was gcse level 30 odd years ago! But we managed as best as we could. There was not one inch of me that was not scrubbed, I laid back and just thought of England. After a while you do relax and just slip into the warm velvety folds of bliss. I think I actually may have regressed to my childhood as the ladies do everything for you, they even guide you onto the rooms to stop you shooting out of the door from all the oil and mud on you. All my british prudishness went out the window and you find yourself in a state of euphoria as all control is taken away from you, just enjoy the moment. The massage with argan oil was incredible, I did think they may have been pressing too hard at one point as I could hear things cracking, however pain I had been suffering in my back and neck was relieved immediately.the massage they do seems to be a mixture of shiatsu, reflexology and general massage, the smells are wonderful. Be prepared to be massaged front and back, you can cover some modesty with a pair of paper knickers, little did I care, I enjoyed the whole experience especially the hair washing, head massage and being scrubbed with almond soap. We relaxed after this awesome session with more mint tea and chatting to the owner.he does not encourage tipping...but do what your heart tells you if you feel it is right. These women have magic fingers and can caress your cares away. I would go back again, there are probably more spa like ones, but for those on a budget price was pretty good and ziani makes that experience even more special with his warm welcome. This hammam comes highly recommended!"

After our session the ladies were not 100% happy with the massage so the owner offered a free same session the next day.The next day we also took the kids(8 of them) and they all enjoyed it also. the owner of the business was very welcoming and entertained the kids while we were waiting for the ladies which took them nearly a hour longer than us.All in all a good experience and worth the money."

We (me and two other men - they have a separate women's section) took the 270 Dirham package (about \u00a322) for which you get soaped and sit in the steam room for about 10 mins; then scrubbed down hard followed by a nice long massage and a wash down. in between each stage, you need to shower in a cubicle. If you have never been to one before, a visit to a hammam in marrakech is a must. The massage we got was very good but: (a) the boys doing it asked for a tip even though there are notices against tipping - they are mostly young students; (b) the place is not the cleanest and showers not the best; (c) they loofah they used for the scrub came out of a new sealed pack but I do wish they used several of them - one second he was scrubbing my heels and toes and the next he was on my face and shoulder with the same loofah - and the loofah does touch your nether areas as well. Ziani, the owner, is a good salesman and you can negotiate if you a group. Also, two of his dogs keep you entertained (although, not in the massage, shower area!). Do go to this place if you are on a budget as there aren't many that give you this quality of massage. But if you are looking for a calm, serene surrounding with nice clean, white interiors and marble all around - this is definitely not the place. The soap they use has an earthy smell that is not to everyone's taste (after smelling me when I came out, my wife changed her mind of trying it!). Most other places that are cleaner, better would cost 400+ DHS. Be prepared to get butt naked - I saw some men wearing their pants (that's underwear in British English!) but we chose not to and it was fine..."

They ladies are very polite and friendly, since this was my first experience I was feeling a bit weird but she made me feel very comfortable and at ease. They start off with the cleansing process and use some kind of mud paste to scrub your body. Once done they take you to the steam room, then they give you a nice and very relaxing hot oil body massage (which I wished lasted forever!) and then there is shampoo it get rid of all the oil.

We had the cheaper package which was about 270 dirham and included hammam, scrub, massage. I felt utterly wonderful and like jelly afterwards which was such a nice change as we'd spent days wondering around the busy and sometimes a little bit hectic souks. The women who did me and my friend didn't speak any English but this wasn't a problem at all, as they know the basics ('turn over') so if you essentially let them turn and flip you around then language thing isn't a problem. I would describe this place as rustic. If you're looking for 5 star tourist luxury this isn't it, but you can get those in London, you come here for something that feels a bit more authentic and is pretty good value too. On a slightly odd note - their mint tea was the nicest I tasted in Marrakech! I haven't had this style of treatment before, so the fairly sudden change from fully clothed to being almost completely naked, wandering between rooms and being rubbed from toes to earlobes was a bit of a shock to me at first, hence be prepared to be naked, but also be prepared to have a lovely relaxing time."

I'd suggest go early in the day, we were the first in there and so it was just us in both the male and female areas for a long time. It isn't for the body shy. I was in just some small paper knickers and my husband in a little towel. You keep slipping the shoes they give you on and off. You need them as it can get very slippy. I had an amazing soaping, steam, scrub, massage, mud pack and then wash off. The amount of dead skin that came off was amazing. Afterwards we both felt amazing and would love to return. The owner is very nice and keen for people not to tip."

My friend and I flew home this Thursday, 23rd May, having decided that a pre-flight visit to a hammam would be a jolly way to wind up our wonderful holiday. We settled for Hammam Ziani and were not disappointed. We did not want the usual spa experience with its inflated prices and sometimes snooty therapists and this traditional hammam was a world away from that. We rather tentatively stepped into the small entrance where we were immediately made to feel welcome by the manager - there was no hard sell, just an explanation of what treatments were available. We discussed them with him over a glass of mint tea and settled for the very reasonably priced two hour deluxe package. We were then collected by our respective therapists, charming and caring women who took us to change and showed us where we could lock away our belongings. We were then given some outrageously small g-strings to wear, much to our amusement. There followed two hours of steaming, scrubbing, massaging with oils and hair washing before we were wrapped in towelling robes and given a towel to dry our hair. This was followed by relaxation in the traditional sitting room, where we sipped our mint tea before leaving with a spring in our step and a great sense of wellbeing.A word or two of caution:1. Although there is a 'no tipping' sign up, a woman who appeared to be in charge came and asked for a tip at the end of the session 'for the girls.' I had no objection to tipping my therapist - she worked incredibly hard on my behalf, but I was concerned that she may not have got a share of the money I handed over.2. Beware of the wet and slippery marble floors. Never move away from the massage tables without immediately putting your hammam shoes back on - these are provided."

First, it was about twenty minutes short of the length that we were told it was going to be; the masseuse skipped his back almost completely. Futhermore, although there are signs everywhere saying that tipping is not permitted, the man who attended him in the hammam demanded a tip at the end. He gave him all the change he had (about 10% of the total, still a reasonable amount, and he wasn't going to give him one hundred dirham), but the attendant insisted it wasn't enough and asked for more. However, when my fiance mentioned the problems to the owner, the owner was very apologetic. He asked my fiance to point out the attendant, then offered a free hour massage or a significant portion of the price back. The service wasn't flawless, but as a business they handled it about as well as you can if your employee acts inappropriately."

One was very contemporary and for me too clinical. The other was similar in style to Ziani, but lacked the friendlieness and very low hassle factor of Ziani. This hammam was brilliant. The treatment itself is as has been described on TA. Every bit of it was wonderful and eased our aching muscles as we had been in the mountains for a few days. We all left feeling refreshed (& exhausted at the same time). The women who did the treatments were fantastic. They guided us carefully through all the different treatments / rooms, etc. Due to the nature of a hammam every surface is wet & slippy. One major advantage of Ziani is that all the treatments are on one level.(at least they are in the female side - do not know about the male side?) In other spas I have been to in Morocco, treatment rooms have been on many levels, making the dangerous slippy floors, even more so. The owner and staff are all very welcoming & made us feel very pampered in Marrakech. Will definitely go again when next in Marrakech."

First of all this is the only Hammam I have been in so I don't know how the others are. There are lots of \"guides\" trying to drag you into every Hammam to get their cut so beware of where you are dragged. One of the great things about this place is the owner who gave us great restaurant recommendations and a list of things to do in Casablanca which was our next stop. The second best was that everything was provided and our cloths and possessions were locked up and reasonably safe. The \"sell\" was very friendly... We were allowed to leave and have lunch before coming back for our treatment. The experience was unique. A mix of steam, scrub, massage, mud pack, and stretching for 350 durams for the deluxe package for 2 hours. A woman on out tour went to a fancy hotel for 1200 durams for 1 hour. This is a lot more authentic.  There was a big sign in the men's area that said tipping is not allowed and i was told that the house splits the take with the workers. MY massage person asked for a tip which was awkward although everyone in Morocco will ask for a tip."

We all tipped 50DH, not due to any pressure but because the work involved deserved it. I would recommend the local feel of this experience against a spa.

Treatments were very good, very thorough (very different experience to an English spa!) - don't expect to cover up! Brilliant massage. We sat down afterwards and were given mint tea and pastries - really great service. We paid 270 dirhams (about \u00a322 at our exchange rate) - more than you would pay in a 'local' hammam, but having spoken to others who went to their corner hammam (where you need to bring own shampoo, bath mat, sponges, buckets etc) our experience sounded so much better, and it was a beautiful setting. As we were passing the next day we were invited in again for another mint tea !! Can't fault the friendliness or service received at all - highly recommended - we would visit again!"

            "review": "Not the best not the worse. We visited Ziani in January 013, based on recommendation from trip adviser, to be fair the review was mixed, and we had open mind when we visited. We paid 350 Dirham which is approx 35\u20ac for that was the price of steam room, wash & scrub! Message and mud mask. We were told that if we wish we can have 1hour message instead of the mud mask; this appealed to us. However the guy who did the deal with us did not tell his staff in the Hammam the change in the program, so we still had to have the 30 min message and the mud mask. It was pointed out by another reviewer that they use the same Lipha/ kiess for scrub from one person to another. And I agree that is the case, I wish I had purchased one from the market they are less than \u00a31 each and taken it with me. Also they don't have good hair shampoo and conditioner etc so take these with you. I was also not that keen on the towel and the bath gown I was given, for some reason I did not feel it was all that clean ( only my feeling mind) so my advise take these things with you and get a price reduction for them. If you negotiated any deal make sure the person who made the. Deal with you pass that information to the staff concerned.Over all it really was not that bad, and I have not caught any thing nasty, so don't be too alarmed, but it is good to know what you are getting and to be happy with it from the start.I have been to Hammam in Kuala Lumpur ( Moroccan Hammam! In KL) and that was far superia and better value than this Hammam in Marakech, the same in Turkey; all in all this was a slight disappointment for me. I will try some where else next time."

After a couple of others in our group found the Ziani Hammam, I made it a point to get there on my last full day in Morocco. As others have mentioned, the owner speaks excellent English and was extremely helpful. Be aware that part of the hammam experience is \"exfoliation\" so expect to be scrubbed within an inch of your life! And also be aware that, for women at least, the \"attire\" is (ahem) a tiny mesh G-string!I had \"the works\" so I spent an hour and a half being rinsed, steamed, scrubbed, massaged, wrapped in plastic and steamed again, and then a final wash including a shampoo. And this cost about $35 U.S.! They use soap and shampoo containing argan oil, which is great. I agree that the concrete slabs in the steam room and massage room could use a bit of padding, but that couldn't take away from the experience. Highly recommended! One caveat...look up the address ahead of time and have a cab take you there. The medina is VERY difficult to navigate on your own."

I would go there every day if I could. You are first taken in for a shower then you are asked to sit in the dome steam room. No one else really bother you in the steam room and there are buckets of water if you want to cool down-I guess its help yourself, I didn't use it. You are then asked to go through to another room within the hammam to get a gommage (Scrub), after the gommage you are directed to the showers again where after its a message on the same bed you were scrubbed. Finally you are soaped down and asked to take one last shower."

Hmmm..I got to be honest having read the reviews myself before going to Ziani I was expecting better\u2026It wasn\u2019t terrible, but it just wasn\u2019t what I was expecting I guess. In brief, my boyfriend went one way I went the other (separate sex hammam) I joined a group of 6 French women. There were only 3 women working so there was A LOT of time waiting in the steam room with absolutely no explanation as to what to expect next which was a little unnerving. The \u2018wash\u2019 took literally seconds then you\u2019re back in the steam room. Then someone comes in, takes you by the hand and lies you on a concrete slab for a scub with the same mit that has just been used on the other ladies\u2026. It\u2019s vigorous, as expected it an exfoliating rub down, but I was just so uncomfortable on a rock hard table.Then.. back in the steam room. Meanwhile, I may add that there is constant shouting and chatting between the workers which again wasn\u2019t what I imagined, as I thought it was supposed to be a relaxing experience \u2013 far from it. The best bit \u2013 the oil massage, more of a rub than a muscular massage but it was nice. As you are not told what you\u2019re doing next I was standing around butt naked waiting to be told where to go next... The steam room. So I decided to take a shower and wash out the oil from my hair, although the showers don\u2019t work so I had to wash my hair using a bucket. The towels and robes are old, like really old so I personally didn\u2019t feel the place as particularly clean. My boyfriend had a different ordeal, it sounded better than what I had, but equally said It was something he\u2019d choose not to do again. However, having said that we have spoken to people who have enjoyed a hammam in various places around Marrakech, so I\u2019m sure it can be a very enjoyable experience, but I won\u2019t be going back to Ziani again.However, I could have visited on a day where they were short staffed, therefore it would explain the long periods of waiting round and having a rushed wash, scrub and massage, but personally I wasn\u2019t impressed with the service."

The masseur did ask me to go and get him a tip and give it to him in the massage room \u2013 he must have had to share if it was handed over in other parts of the establishment or something along those lines; but I was happy to tip him and I did as asked. I gave him 50 Dirhams (~5 Euros) and he seemed happy. I had the seaweed wrap add on and all up it cost D350 (or around 35 Euros).

Certainly, it is well known in Marrakech and is favoured by local people as well as visitors.For 270 MDM (around \u00a325) you enjoy 90 minutes of indulgence in surroundings that are a pure delight. This is the total price for steam, gommage and the wonderful massage. Everything is provided, so you need only walk in and allow yourself to be pampered at a far lower price that your Hotel will charge.Take a taxi to the Parking le Prefecture, right opposite. Every taxi driver knows Hammam Ziani. And then ENJOY!"

Visiting a Hammam for the first time can be a bit scary, and those that tout themselves as \u2018tourist friendly\u2019 usually ask tourist prices too. Not the case for Hammam Ziani. The service was so good, and so cheap, that we visited twice. Once for just the basic steam, scrub and shower, and the second time for the massage too (around \u00a315 for this - great value). Staff were friendly (it doesn\u2019t matter that they don\u2019t speak English, they show you what to do without it), the place was clean, and the hammam itself relaxing and excellent value. Us girls weren\u2019t asked to tip at all, and in fact would have liked to have done, but my husband was asked for one \u2013 out of sight of the CCTV camera, so clearly staff have been told not to ask for tips. If you\u2019ve never been to a Hammam, visit this one. If you have visited a tourist-friendly one before and been disappointed (as we were in Turkey), you won\u2019t be here."

I agree with most of the reviews here that it is quite an authentic experience - although a bit on the more expensive side - but much cheaper than if you were to go to the Hilton.They offer several packages but it is structured such that you have not much choice but to choose the basic package at 270 Dirhams. This gives you a steam bath, a scrub, a massage and a cup of that obligatory mint tea afterwards. There is a locker for you to keep all your valuables - but i would not suggest that you bring too much precious stuff with you as the locker does not look too strong for the determined thief.For those who find the steam bath too cold, just inform the attendant who will turn up the heat. Trust me, it does get extremely hot once they turn it on. As for the scrub, for those not used to it, it is strange but you will be surprised at how much dirt they can get off you.The massage is more like \"Thai\" massage than aromatherapy massage so be prepared to be pressed and turned, rather than \"stroked\".The whole experience lasted about one and a half hours to 2 hrs. As usual, you are expected to tip.I only give 4 stars instead of 5 for these reasons:1. Price is way too expensive in Marrakesh. The local hammam is only about 10-20% of the price.2. Locker is not strong enough3. Pressured to give a tip at the end of service."

They give you a basket with all the neccessary lotions etc and you change into a wrap which stays on throughout (men). Your attendant then takes you to the steam room where you wash with black olive soap and then are taken to a table for the gommage. Rough gloves and more soap get you really clean. After a shower you have a massage. Very good full body massage then another shower and out to get dressed. The whole experience lasted about one and a half hours. You are expected to tip the guy who performs the treatment. Give whatever you think appropriate. When you are dressed you are served mint tea in a small lounge.

I can't begin to describe how wonderful an experience I had at the Hamman Ziani in Marakech.The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming to my friend and I. We visited first and were shown around the spa so we could see how it all worked and what would happen and then the various packages were explained to us. We bought the deluxe package for 350 dirhams (about \u00a344), which meant we didn't have to book in, just turn up when we wanted and included the steam, gommage (the scrubbing), 30 min full body massage with scented argon oil, 30 min seaweed wrap and almond full body and hair wash.It was a luxuriant experience, though the girls who provided our treatments spoke limited English and us limited French we were able to communicate and have a nice conversation. The architecture of the hamman itself was beautiful, with lots of white tiles, arched ceilings and grey and white marble tables and sinks that were intricately carved.A pair of bikini knickers (brand new), a key locker, slip on flip flops and a terry cloth robe were provided as part of the package and at no time did you feel hurried. I have very long hair and one of the ladies also took the time to brush it for me after the session had ended, which was an additional luxury that I enjoyed.Tipping is expected and other reviewers have complained about this. However, tipping in Morroco is an expected part of the culture, but you shouldn't be expected to tip until you are dressed and able to access your locker. We gave a 50 dirham tip (about \u00a36) between the two of us as we had two ladies working on us constantly for 1.5 hrs and an attendant who helped us in the changing rooms.After the session we spent 15 minutes in the chill out room and had a complementary mint tea (the morrocan drink of choice) and listened to some lovely ambient music.All the products used on us were available to buy in their boutique, but it must be noted that prices here are much higher than the pharmacies in the Kasbah and Souk, but we were not pressured to buy anything, which was nice.I would be very tempted to go back to Marrakech for a weekend just to experience this Hamman again. It was a great experience and a wonderful way for my friend and I to round off our holiday in Marrakech on our last day."

If you haven't had an authentic hammam, you may be impressed by the beautifully decorated, expensive production-line set-ups around Marrakech. If you want \"the job done\" this is the place.Once we found the hammam in a lane ( near a historic palace) we were shown a menu of treatments. We chose the hamman option with an argan oil body massage.We were prepared with our \"swim wear\" with us- you will be only wearing the bottom half. We were led to the ladies section, given a set of towelling robes, slippers and a locker with a key. Then we entered a dome shaped traditional steam room.The room was steamy and since we picked 2pm (early by local standards) we had the place to ourselves. It was a great experience, especially the way the shafts of light streaked through the steam ( the dome shaped room had small holes in it, and the sunlight pierced through- we were in another era. The scrub was great, the massage was amazing, they even washed my hair for me afterwards, i've never had such a good head massage. The staff we very welcoming and friendly. Tipping is standard in Marrakech, we were not pressured. In fact after the treatment, we went looking for the ladies to give them a token of appreciation. Its clean, prices are good ( we paid 270 Dh for our treatment), we emailed in advance, but they replied and stated we could walk in anytime, as is the custom in a Morrocan Hammam. Afterwards we sat and had a refreshing mint tea in the salon. I like the authenticity, although it isn't one of the \"public\" hammams where one would take their own soap, towel, bucket etc. its adequate for me. I shall be returning and have recommended Hammam Ziani to everyone i've met. ( i've had about 8 hammam treatments in the past)They speak enough English to communicate, the prices are fair, the treatments are thorough, and they do a good job. thanks to trip advisor, it was because of a previous review that i chose to visit."

Anyway, scrubbing felt like a massage, the hot room was good and clean, there were enough assistants there to guide and treat us, there was a decent changing room and a nice relaxing (tea) room for after-bath. There are probably many more luxurious hammams around, but this was a very good introduction to all of us. Everybody felt very happy, and ready for a good dinner, afterwards. This contrasted greatly with the experience we had in a terrible \"hammam\" a few days later in Essaouira (for a higher price)."

I researched thoroughly before embarking on the hammam experince, so that I would be prepared for what was to come, having never even been to a spa before. I was not let down by my experience at Ziani. The guy on the reception talks you through the options ( I went for the full package) and although the women inside don't speak much English or French, they are pretty patient and point you where you need to go, so it's best to just go with it. You get handed a basket with a robe etc in it, get changed into your paper knickers and make your way to the first area where you hang up your robe. The staff can tell what package you're on by the colour of your flip flops and the basket you're given to take with you (not sure why, maybe in case you want to use your own shampoo etc). Oh and yes, I would slip some money for tips into the pocket of your robe when you're getting changed so that you have that with you at the end. You then go and sit in the steam room for a while till a lady summons you to be soaped down and splashed clean, Then you sit some more, till another lady comes in and you are massaged, scrubbed and slathered in mud and plastic sheeting to within an inch of your life! The whole experience is quite odd but the women are friendly and have seen it all before. At the end you can shower and wash your hair (although I'm not sure if there's a hairdryer) and get helped back into your robe. Generally, the lady that massages you is the one who gets tipped and she'll be with you for most of the process. The place does smell a bit odd, but not dirty, just don't expect the kind of shiny clinical feel of a comparable Western institution. I enjoyed it and was clean and soft at the end of it all, glad I did it."

She was detained in the property until I arrived and gave her money to set her free.This is simply horrible. My wife almost burst into tears when she saw me.

I was left in the steam room for a long time and then given a quick massage and scrub.The scrub was great, but for that price, I would have liked to be treated less as a problem and more as a valued customer.Worse, 2 young women tourists decided to walk in with 4 wailing children.

The Ziani was the most conveniently located- so I went back- but with extreme misgivings. I told the owner about my awful experience the last time and he assured me that this time would be different. He instructed one of the attendants to look after me- and gosh, did she! I was given fantastic treatment, a lovely scrub and massage and a great sauna soak.In the end, I came away with good feelings about Ziani- but if you want to be treated well there- you will need to be a bit assertive.Otherwise, thanks to some good reviews here, they get a lot of tourist traffic and may be slacking just a bit.Go there for the convenient location, good facilities and treatment that can be very good- if you push for it.."

I chose the Hammam Ziani because I didn't want a very expensive upmarket 'feminine' place with rose petals and the like, but neither did I want a public steam room. Having read previous reviews off the internet, i reckoned that this place was just about right- and it was , for what I wanted. I took th 280 dirhams menu- and it was everything i wanted. When you go in they allocate someone to you who looks after you for the duration of your stay. My man was 'abdullah'. First he shows you to the changing room where you swap your clothes for a sarong like wrap. Clothes are put into a locker and you keep the key. First a shower and a soap rub, then on into a very steamy steam room for about 15 minutes. on emerging from the dteam room another quick shower and then onto a 'table'. There were four tables in the room and other people were being treated at the same time, but by different attendants. I have been to a hammam in Turkey once. There the job was done on the floor of the large baths area, this place is a bit more upmarket than that. No sloshing of water buckets - however much fun that is. The room is tiled and there is a coloured glass window. First round is a good scrub with a sort of loofah mitt. All over, but carefully just avoiding the most intimate parts. Abdullah showed me just how much skin came off me. A lot! Then a shower , and on to the massage. It was quite strong. With oils rubbed in to all over. A few stretches and pressure applications nearly made my eyes water!! Then some warm soap and a hair and body wash, and another shower to get it all cleaned off. You come out feeling so fresh and clean. All the spare skin is sloughed off, and knots and hairs straightened. Really an exceptional experience. Reborn is what people say. However I recognise its not for everyone. My wife didn't fancy it, nor the other couple we travelled with. Its not for someone with (say) a bad back unless the masseur is extra careful - or people who are overly embarrassed about another person being that personal about cleaning them almost all over. However, cosidering the whole experience, I enjoyed it and look forward to going again to a hammam sometime.Just to mention, it took me ages to find the place, maps of marrakesh are not good. However , in fact it is only about five minutes off the main square. Just a few doors along, there is a shop selling soaps, oils and ungents. Run by a man called Zac. Its a good place to buy things to take home to use as next best thing to having this kind of scrub at a hammam. Ask the man on the ticket desk where Zac' s place is!"

It was great fun.We arrived at 1pm and bought the full experience for MAD 350 (about \u00a320).First, we got changed into these skirt things you have to wear. Then a shower and steam for 20 minutes.Then we had a salt scrub (it takes the skin off if you're not careful), oil massage, seaweed wrap, soaping and shower again followed by mint tea. It all lasted about 90 minutes.Being honest, the massage wasn't the most sensational I've ever experienced but for the price you cannot complain and the place is clean and seems to target tourists.I'd go back."

The whole experience was much more clinical. You very much felt that the purpose was to get you clean, rather than the 'Spa' experience which always feels a little more intimate and designed to relax. Not that that was a bad thing. Both my sister and I came out feeling great and would definately do it again. We had the package at 350 DH / \u00a324ish, included gommage (scrub), massage (and yes, they massage ALL of you, from head to toes), seaweed wrap ( watch out for the cold marble slab underneath you and hot slop on top - weird) and drink (aka mint tea!). She has skin that can react to creams and I have pressure urticaria, but whatever they used didn't cause any reactions much to our surprise.Good way to spend a couple of hours out of the chaos of the medina. Never been to any other Hammam so can't tell you if good value for money, but the package worked well for a novice, and compared to rip off England seemed good to me !"

Traditional Hammam in Marrakech - Hammam ZianiLocal Traditional Hammam, English spoken, and English price/description lists on front reception counter...Very friendly..ladies and gents separate..No mixed as this is a traditional local hammam. Can wear Bikini, or one piece swimsuit but most ladies wear just their pants!My husband & I went to this local hammam as we thought that was more authentic, and had been highly recommended by other guests staying at our Riad.We were told to go about 2 pm, as it gets busy about 4-4.30pm with the locals. We went to the Hammam Ziani, we did not need to take towels etc only thing to take for the ladies was a spare pair of pants! and spare pair of undies for the men unless you go naked.Our experience was fantastic, lasted 1hour 45 mins, but my husbands lasted 2 hours! We had traditional steam room, then soaped down, splashed with very warm water, then steam again, then another soap down, then another splash down, then exfoliation (Wonderful) they even pumice your feet!, then soap down, then full massage with oil, then soap down and hair washed...you are given a basket with all clean products, wrap etc which only you use.Came out feeling exceptionally clean and soft. It cost us about 18.00 ..really good value and I wish we had had it at the start of our holiday then we could have had another minus the exfoliation just before we went home!The ladies in there do not speak English but its not necessary, as they simply lead you where they want you. There were other tourists in there but it was not busy, my husband did not want to come out after his session...he enjoyed it so much!"

First you will be greeted by the always smiling Fatima, a lovely lady the will scrub your body from head to toes with black soap and then cover you with mud called ghassoul, and then, you will be scrubbed again by Fatima (make sure you ask for her). Then you will be taken to another room where lovely Karima and Lubna will pamper you with a body massage (we also asked for a facial treatment also performed by them), let me tell you that you and your spouse will be taken to a peaceful paradise of relaxation! after one hour you then will be taken to a small room for you to relax and drink a cup of tea for a few minutes.

This place is hard to find so we scouted it the day before, make sure you give yourself enough time to look for it.The hammam was such an amazing experience. The girls upstairs were very thorough and professional. You don't know how much dirt you have on your body until you've had a proper hammam experience. These girls scrubbed the heck out of us and our skin had never felt so good. It was truly an unforgettable experience, it had me researching hammams in NYC.Now to the massage...We walked in the couple's massage room and I smiled at my masseuse, she barely made eye contact and gave me a smirk (weird, I know). The massage started out ok then it became apparent that she was not in the mood to give a massage. lol Now I know how my dog feels when I'm doing something else while I'm halfheartedly petting him. 1/3 of the time, she actually exerted some pressure while massaging me. The next third, she was barely doing anything. She was kind of playing with my hair at one point with one hand. ( I think she was on her phone with the other hand) Then the last third, guess what, she just disappeared. lol She walked out of the room and didn't come back for 5 minutes. I thought the massage was over so I started to get up and saw that my husband was still getting massaged so I laid back down. She finally came back and massaged my legs for a minute then stopped. I laid there for 10 minutes (not exaggerating), 10 MINUTES!, without any clue what was going on since nothing at all was happening. I finally got up because I didn't know what else to do, my husband was still getting his massage and my masseuse was behind my massage bed on her phone. I asked \"Are we finished?\" and she scowled at me, I asked her again and she said loudly \"OK\". I felt bad that my husband had to end his massage but I was so confused, I had no idea what was happening! I think maybe since she was about 4 months pregnant, she was hormonal. It's either that or she REALLY, REALLY hates giving massages! Anyway, the massage ruined it for me. I give the hammam 5 stars. I would definitely come back here for that and we highly recommend it. Bring an extra pair of underwear because you have to wear one during the hammam. My husband gives his masseuse 5 stars, I will give mine zero stars. I've been getting massages once a month for 15 years now and I can honestly say that it was the worst massage I've ever had. If you're getting a massage, make sure it's not with the angry pregnant lady. She'll give you the stink eye. ;-)"

It was rough and hurted a little, but it was OK in the end. They then covered our bodies with some beauty cream, and we waited for a while before being rinsed and lead to the massage room. Now I must stop to say my skin was never so great as after this treatment. My wife loved the way my skin got.I thought the massage was good, my wife said it was one of the best of her life. We were always in the same room, and after comparing our experiences, I concluded we got exactly the same treatment, we just differed in our perception.After the massage we were lead to a room to relax and have some tea, and after that dressed our clothes, paid and went away pretty relaxed and satisfied.They provide everything, I would just recommend a change of underwear if you don't want to go away with wet undies or going commando."

I asked to be washed up a little sooner than than expected time as heat was too uncomfortable.Then it started with the facial and the body massage which was nothing more than a soak in oils and the girl was inexperienced and just gave a little rub all over the body and the face with Argan Oil.Next was the pedicure which started of with removing my nail Polish and she asked if I wanted the nails clipped I agreed but stopped her after the first nail as she started to cut them round and chopped a chunk of the corner so asked her if she could keep it straight and just file them instead. She takes a lame used buffer from her raggard bag to smooth out my nails from the top which she did one and gave up and didn't bother with the second foot. Her filer to smooth the nails was too lame to hold the movement which she struggled with through out.She didn't have a proper loafer to take the dead skin off the feet, at this point I lost interest and was deeply disappointed and wanted to arrange my lift to get back to the Riad I asked for wifi access they refused to provide wifi password for whatever reason. I continued to watch the girl struggling with her poor quality materials to carry out the rest of the treatment. She was rough with the cuticles and cut the firsr one too close which exposed the redness front of the cuticle I asked her not to cut the cuticles and just pushed them back.This was the cherry on the cake when she dug out an old bottle of clear nail Polish which was too dry and hardly any left in the bottle, I watched her put the lumps on to my nails and finished off by taking me down stairs to the rest room on my way down the stairs I slipped off the slippery rug on the tiles the man who manages the place giggled immaturely.This was a complete waste of time, a day before leaving Morocco. As I sit here writing this review with lumpy clear nail polish on my hands and regretting the time I wasted this morning which was supposed to be relaxing. Unfortunately the place is hidden away in very rough part of medina with inexperienced staff and above all they have poor quality beauty materials at their disposal through."

We have booked to go back to the same Riad we stayed in (Riad Dar Najat) and have already asked them to schedule us for another hammam with Isis Spa. There are many places that try and offer you a cheap hammam - my advice is - go to this spa. We were made to feel dignified throughout the whole time there Hope this helps you to decide."

It was so relaxing my favourite was the hammam id never had one before and although I had sun burn it left me feeling lovely. Just a point to note if you've never had a hammam like I hadn't the lady that carries out the hammam which is a mixture of tipping buckets of cold water on you and rubbing a black soap bar on your skin, then she vigorously rubs you with a mit to get the dead skin off which if you've got sensitive skin it might be abit of a shock to the system. Also she asks you to remove your bikini top which I didn't mind but some ladies may be abit more self conscious so it's just a warning for you so you know what to expect, I'm sure if you requested to leave it on that would be fine too. The massage part was great too very professional the staff made you feel very welcome. We are English speaking but staff had no problem communicating with us. It's all thanks to trip advisor reviews how we ended up trying the Isis Spa and we are so glad that we did. Do not leave Marrakech without visiting this place! Don't be tempted by cheaper places as this place is well worth the money!"

After the massage we could relax with some mint tea in a nice room. Interior is nice and relaxing and staff is very friendly. You need to book a day in advance ad they are busy.

The location was hard to find however the atmosphere in the lounge of the spa was wonderful. It made me look forward to the experience even more. However everything went downhill from here. The hamman experience was not enjoyable. The two ladies were chatting the whole duration which was not relaxing at all for us. After a very short scrub, we just sat around waiting/\"resting\" for 15 minutes. 4 of us (my bf and I plus the two ladies working) sat around awkwardly \"relaxing\". The massage did not get much better. If you like soft/no pressure rub, this is the place for you. It honestly felt like someone just rubbing my body up and down. The massage also had 15 minutes of just \"relaxing\" laying around (with the 2 masseuse hiding in the corner chatting!). Our experience ended 20 minutes earlier than we paid for (we were told once again to relax in yet another room).I was very unhappy with the overall service and complained. I was met with a very condescending attitude from them. The manager was no longer there (the only professional one we met during our experience!). From what I saw, it is much better when he was there. We went a bit later and the employees were definitely \"slacking\" off!"

As there were so many spas in Marrakech that offer hammam massages, my sister and I booked at this spa based on the 'excellent' reviews on tripadvisor.We had booked the 'Care Relaxation Ritual' package (Hammam + scrub with honey almond and raised oil + clay wrap pink + Jacuzzi +45min massage + facial good mine honey) lasting 2h30mins at 450dhs each as a special March promotion, and we were very disappointed that it was anything but relaxing. I'm not a spa type of person, so I'm not very difficult to please, but I was not impressed at all with this service, and my sister was very much looking forward to this as we had hiked to Ourika Valley the day before. Positives: Lovely looking spa and open spaced; lovely receptionistNegatives: One poor woman on her own completing the hammam scrub for me and my sister, with a loud tap running in the background, so not relaxing.The 45min massage for actually like 5mins in total and more of a gentle rub down, and when I asked for more pressure it was just slightly more; during the facial there was no massage, just slapping on whatever product they put on, and left us for long periods in-between at which time the two masseuses were talking away with each other - so couldn't relax. I think it's pot-luck which masseuse you get, because my sister said her's was quite good, but obvious really short.The owner was rude and non-apologetic when we tried to explain that we didn't have the 45min massage. So we asked for a discount - she was only going to give 90dhs off each, considering that their cheapest massage for 2ppl is 580dhs for 60mins, we felt that was not acceptable. So after a bit of slightly heated discussion we had agreed on 300dhs each. Final thoughts: The venue was lovely enough, but think the staffing level, skills and their attitudes need to be improved. However, other patrons around us seemed to be happy, so I'm not sure if were we just unlucky!"

As soon as we entered, we knew we were in a professional, high quality spa. The ambiance & the decor gave the place a beautifully calming look. Even though the place has 10 rooms, 5 for hamman & 5 for massages, they were all occupied. So we reserved ourselves a suitable slot and came back later for the treatment.We went for the Traditional Ritual, 1 hr 45 minutes package. After storing our belongings in the locker room, we went for the hour long Hamman. It was a combination of steam and body scrub. The room was hot & humid, there seemed to be some heating underneath the sitting/bed. Soap,Body Packs,Face Packs, Shampoo were applied at intervals during the treatment. In between the scrubs we were just left to lay in the room, initially the heat was a bliss but after 15 minutes the room use to become unbearable due to the steam, then the next round of scrubbing & bathing use to start, making it bearable again. It was a unique cleansing experience. After Hamman we went for the message, it was among the best i have ever had. The pressure applied was perfect. Afterwards we were lead to another room to lay in & let the argon oil be soaked in. For 400 dirham for a 1 hr 45 minutes package, felt the place to be cheap as the standards maintained are of the highest quality."

The masseurs were great about making sure that I could talk to my daughter whenever we wanted to and kept the massage appropriate to her age (9) and mine (older than 9). After our experience we were all led to a relaxation room that was warm and quiet. We enjoyed mint tea and an additional time relaxing.

So I booked the eternal love care pacakage (890 dH).It was a bit tricky to find it, but if you ask some of the more casual disinterested shop keepers they let you know which way to continue.The Spa is beautiful but as we were late we changed our package to one that wasn't as long (790 dH = 1 hr. and 45 min.). We could've had the massage all day, once I asked the lady to be slightly more firm it was exactly the right pressure.The staff were all smiles, very polite and welcoming, and gave us as much time as we wanted.Post hammam and massage we were to able to hang out and drink some tea, and no exaggeration the tea was some of the best I've ever had.AMAZING value.

Going on what we read before coming to Marrakech we decided not to listen to the corner shop man telling us where the spa was located. We did end up listening to him after taking a few wrong turns, ended up buying some sweets from him later and thanking him for the direction. The spa was lovely, be prepared to know your company very well with whom you go with. Ladies are expected to be topless. After the initial embarrassed moments you get over it and enjoy the hammam scrub down. Seeing how much dirt and dead skin comes off you is nauseating, however the feeling after is lovely silky smooth skin. You get to keep the exfoliation mitt they use for you. The massage was amazing, I asked for it to be firm and my gosh firm it was. Felt so good and relaxing as we went walking in the Imlil Valleys yesterday so a great treatment to have for aching calves.

When you set foot in this place, you forget the hustle and bustle outside. It is extremely clean and steaming with aroma. You start in the waiting room until your appointment, tea served. Then you get taken to the changing room where you put away your stuff in a locker. You have to wear shorts (for men) and get their robe and plastic sandals. You get taken upstairs to a room where the hammam takes place. The lovely ladies wash you down, apply some stuff and wash you down. The they scrub you down and wash and so on, it went on for about an hour. Eventually you dry with their towels and put the robe back on. Then you get taken to the warm-ish massage room when you lie face down and listen to the music. The lady starts to massage you oils starting with you feet and working her way up, right up to the face and forehead. But most of the massage is directed at the back. She correctly identified that I had a tired back (since I work in a constant sitting job). The massage went on for about an hour after which I was taken to another cooler room where I was wrapped in a blanket and given tea. I rested there for an enternity and nearly fell asleep. Then got called to get changed. There was no compulsion to give a tip but I wanted to show my appreciation for the ladies upstairs; they had a little tip box.It was wonderfully relaxing experience in a truly prefessional environment. I have only 2 minor criticisms; they start the massage with the feet (with bare hands, I presume) and work up to the face. Now I thats not hygienic; I wouldnt want anything transferring from my feet to the face. Secondly the sheets on the massage table have a hole through which you breath when lying face down. The hole area of the sheets smelled rather tired and unpleasing. My suggestion is that they should use rubber gloves when massaging the feet and also have a disposal paper napkin to rest the face on.Other than that, this is a wonderful spa and I thoroughly enjoyed the treatment here. I will definitely be booking into this place the next time I am in Marrakech."

Every single staff member that I interacted with (5 different folks) was so warm and pleasant. The hammam scrub down and rinse was excellent and relaxing. The room wasn't very steamy, but warm enough. After that I was led to the jacuzzi - but it wasn't nearly warm enough for my tastes, so we skipped on ahead to the facial and massage. The facial was long and luxurious and the products smelled great. The massage was thorough, but quite gentle. My fault for not asking for more pressure. After that I went back to the jacuzzi (which the host had worked hard to make hotter). It had increased in temp from 28 to 32. This was better, but I am used to piping hot jacuzzis and therefore this still felt quite tepid. Lastly, I was guided to the relaxation room and covered in 2 blankets and given some tea. It was quite cozy and I would've stayed longer, but we were on the 3rd or 4th round of the same CD playing over and over again and I couldn't handle it. For the record, the piano songs are: Crazy (Patsy Cline), Bridge Over Troubled Water, Yesterday, ???, Come Away With Me (Nora Jones), Unchained Melody, and Everything I Do - I Do It For You (Richard Marx). I would definitely go again! The PRICE was insanely good. I was not at all pressured for a tip, but I left one because they definitely deserved it! Recap of the things that could improve: music, jacuzzi temp, massage pressure.THANKS, Isis! :)"

We were given our own posh robes and taken to the Hammam room where we were thoroughly scrubbed down and massaged by two of the friendliest women. We were then taken to the massage room where we were treated to the best full body massage that I've ever experienced. We got the traditional ritual package at only 300 dirhams.

Bring a bathing suit. Women must be topless. Men: wear something that can expose most of your legs for the scrub and massage. The scrub was interesting, it's like rough sand paper and it hurt at times (but my bf said it did not hurt him) but the amount of dead skin that comes off is incredible. And our skin was so soft afterwards! The ladies doing the scrub were very nice, we speak French so I'm not sure of their English skills. I give the massage a 6 out of 10. Typical for touristy spas, i didn't expect more. It was relaxing, though, and we got to relax with mint tea after."

Our fears were totally unfounded. Entering the calm of the building an English speaking man discussed out options and the fees. All very soft sell. We opted for the full Haman wash and body scrub for an hour followed by an hours massage in a double room so we could mutter sighs of enjoyment to each other throughout. For those new to this experience we had to keep our pants on and rather wished we had brought swimming gear with us as we walked back to our Riad pantless! Ladies wear nothing up top for the duration. The body stub with an abrasive flannel really does seem to remove a layer of dead skin, then Argan Oil is gentle massaged into the 'new' skin. Delightful. A must on any visit to Marrakech."

He said the price is fair, the service valuable and the people warm and full of values (meaning they don't cheat on tourists, but they sell the real product, using the real oils and beneficial essences). 39 euro for 45 min Hammam and one hour massage and it felt great! Two very nice girls assisted us during the hammam with delicacy and respect. Then my friend and I were accompanied in the treatment room where two therapists gave us a massage for one hour. To improve: explain what you are doing before doing it (it is interesting and guest is curious to know), cleanless. Such a great experience, such great and professional people!

We had no idea what to expect and i will say the first part of the visit surprised us but we truly enjoyed the experience. You are first cleansed with buckets of water and scrubs/mud rubbed in to your entire body. You are scrubbed pretty hard to get all the dead skin off and rinsed again. You are nude except for underwear so know that going in and you'll be ok. Then we received a 45 minute massage which offset the harshness of the cleaning process. There were candles lit, music playing and it was very relaxing. Price is very reasonable.Its very hard to find this spa as there is no sign out front and its down an alley with a few twists and turns so get good directions or have someone from the spa meet you on the main path maybe to make it easier. Its beautiful inside and was a nice escape from the hustle and bustle.We had to go straight to the airport after so I'd recommend giving yourself some time before the next activity to go back and rinse oils off/reapply makeup/hair fix."

As much as i wanted to brave the local spas, my man and i wanted to do it together (uncommon of course for morocco). Isis offered a couple's package for about $25 a person. We got lovely clean robes, a private room for washing down (this part is surprisingly unsexy with lots of water, steam, and scrubbing --- however, I literally went grey with dead skin after all our travels, so I was extremely happy to be sloughed off and buffed up with vigor). I brought my own conditioner because my hair is thick and curly and they only offer basic shampoo (there is an option to not get your hair wet but it would be difficult I think). Then we were taken to a private room for a 45 minute massage. The massage was gentle but pleasant with nice oils. Then we were taken to a resting room with comfy chairs to stretch out in (still in our robes). The staff literally tuck you in with a nice blanket, and bring you a cup of mint tea. It was dark and quiet. We nearly fell asleep, and no staff bothered us to move along. Thus, it was perfect for the price. We tipped into a communal jar, though personally I hope the girls who have to sit in the steam room (SO hot) get most of it because they're literally wet and hot all day long. I would have tipped them directly but, of course, I was in my robe and not my clothes. Side note - they provide a locker with a key to leave your bags in. 2nd side note - was a bit difficult to find. I called ahead and a staff member met us outside the Cafe de France and walked us the rest of the way. "

We were in the waiting area with other couple for at least 10min before being ushered into the changing room's and then taken upstairs to the deck and told to wait... Shortly after we were taken into the steam rm and 3 ladies/spa staff appeared flustered and confused as they got organised... then the hamman/body scrub started with my wife & i being attended by an old woman & young lady that appeared to be doing 2 rms at once, i gather the other couple were in steam rm opposite. 3 girls/staff to 2 couples... Although the scrub/steam rm was nice one only imagines if it was busier how the staff would manage... We got a good 40-min steam & scrub and the last 15 min the staff were just sitting in rm with us chatting amongst themselves.... a bit disappointing..On the positive; the massage downstairs was great, i nearly fell asleep... The 2 girls that looked after my wife and i were great...Then we were moved to another rm with 4 beds and candles and were told nothing...Apparently this was the chill out rm... but with 4 men & 2 woman with 4 beds was more uncomfortable than chill out...

We were looking for a nice and not too expensive couples package, so we decided to choose \"Care Eternal Love\" package that had a special price of 850 dhs for 2 persons. All in all, it was a pleasant spa experience, even though it could have been better. PROS:- Friendly and helping staff.- Tranquil and clean spa, tucked away from all the hustle and bustle on a small side street. The atmosphere inside the spa was really nice. - Very nice massage (third and last treatment). I felt like I had a proper massage and I wasn't just being patted.- Good scrub by the \"hammam girls\". SO-SO:- The place is a bit hard to find but so is almost everything else in Marrakech. - The hammam (first treatment) is interesting if you haven't experienced it before. The girls who scrubbed us were friendly and attentive and we were able to stay together in the same room, which was nice. We were thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed and it felt great. But it still wasn't quite the real thing and we left the room feeling like we've had a good but a bit ordinary spa treatment. It just doesn't give you the real hammam feeling. - After the hammam we had to move two floors lower to the jacuzzi room. During that time we were cooled down a bit because the outside temperature wasn't that high. And because the spa itself was cool in late February, we would have expected the jacuzzi water to be a few degrees warmer.CONS:- The massage room wasn't as warm as it should have been. The temperature was almost ok for me but my girlfriend said it was too chilly to enjoy the treatment. - After the massage we had to put on our robes, which had already become damp after the hammam and jacuzzi (although they tried to dry/warm them up on a heater) and we were guided to a \"relaxation room\". The room itself was chilly and having the damp robe on didn't make me feel much relaxed after a nice massage, so we decided to drink our warm tea and leave. TIPS:- If you are looking for a real hammam experience, you shouldn't be going to a spa. If you want a few treatments and a bit of pampering, then Isis Spa is a good choice. - Try to go there when it's warmer outside or ask the staff to turn up the heat in the treatment rooms, so you wouldn't have to think about being chilly."

We chose the steam bath that consists of a wash, clay/mud rubbed all over our bodies and a full body exfoliation followed by an hour massage. Absolutely wonderful!The girls looking after us were very professional and lovely. My body afterwards hadn't felt that soft in ages and the experience is totally and utterly relaxing.

Got a taxi from our Riad at the other side of the medina, he dropped us as close as we could get then we spent 15 mins trying to find it. In the end we knocked on the door of a riad asked for directions and they sent someone to show us. Its in a maze so get someone to meet you from the spa at the square, as it literally 5 mins away. We were greeted and shown to the changing room where lockers, robes and slippers were provided. Had full traditional hammam which was an experience but absolutely perfect. following that we had full body massages. The room was a little cold but hot towels were used to cover us. This was so relaxing and one of the best massages I've had. After the massage you are put in another room to relax some more in a snug blanket on a lounger with tea! We only left when we realised we would soon be asleep! We were walked back to the square by an employee. Highly recommend this place!"

We were staying at Riad les nuits de Marrakesh who recommended this Hammam and after hearing from other guests how good it was we asked our hosts to book. Not only did they book but they took us there. I doubt many people would venture in without a recommendation its off the rue darb Dabachi down a few undesirable looking alleys but off course as soon as you step through the door you enter a different world. Away from the dust grime and chaos of outside into a beautifully renovated riad of serenity.We booked the couples hammam and massage. Staff were welcoming and gracious. We were led into a changing room where we put on our swimwear and we were given clean white robes and warm white towels and footwear.After being lead to a room on the roof terrace we did as we were asked while two young girls soaped scrubbed and rinsed us.Unfortunately it got too hot for my husband and when he was asked to sit up he passed out briefly but all he needed was cooling down which we did and he was fine. The girls were very friendly and professional.We were then led downstairs for a massage which was excellent, normally you have the ticklish feet...but not here she knew the pressure points very well.Very relaxing and again very professional. We ended in the relaxation room with a glass off mint tea.Loved every minute of it. My skin feels really soft, my husband enjoyed it. Not normally his thing. They do lots of other treatments and had i got time i would be returning.Would highly recommend. And sorry girls if my husband passing out panicked you."

We had the 45 minute Hamman followed by a 30 minute massage for 580dh for a couple. We thoroughly enjoyed. First we had the Hamman, which was great felt very clean afterwards. Then the massage which was lovely. Finally you have tea in the chill out room.It was very clean, and they supply a robe and slippers. It was great value for money, with other spas charging twice the price. I wore a one piece costume which I wouldn't recommend as it is easier with two pieces. My boyfriend just brought swim shorts which was fine.We have booked to go again before we go home. Would definitely recommend trying here."

From the second we stepped into the spa, we felt transported. Beauty surrounded us in sights and senses. The spa treatments included a luxurious exfoliation and scrub down with a body masque. We also received an indulgent shampoo treatment. Afterwards, we were taken to a quiet, dark room where the lovely masseurs massaged oils into our freshly scrubbed skin. We left feeling indulgently pampered and the most relaxed we've been in years! The staff were kind and helpful and everything about our time at Isis Spa was brilliant."

The price was fantastic. It was a proper spa experience over three floors. We had a hamman and massage for 580dh for two.

They later also stated that the owner of their Riad visits ISIS on every one of their visits from France. We travelled as 2 couples.The recommendation was enough to sell me so I booked 2 x couples hammam/massage at 580 dirhams per couple online, from home in English with no problems. I tend to book this wherever I go and for me, the highlight is the hammam and the massage is always a nice finishing touch. mainly because I hate my feet being touched and have the pain threshold of a small child.Not here. Admittedly I've had better hammams, most noticably in Athens but I have never had a massage quite like this one. No problem with feet or anywhere.Now I woke up that morning at 0230 for an early flight from UK and landed around 1100. The hammam was booked for 1400 so I really needed it and I am mindful that an average massage would probably seem good in the circumstances but all 4 of us, obviously with 4 different masseuses each felt the same. I had in my reasonably competent French worked out how to say to the girl that without comparison it was the best I'd had only to mumble incoherently when the time came such was my dopey relaxed state! They offer Moroccan mint tea as the perfect end to a relaxing few hours. Naturally after such an experience all 4 of us returned at the end of our stay. The wives had chocolate hammam body wraps and pedicures, us gents had a 4 hand massage with 2 girls each that I have never experience but was again absolutely wonderful.Morocco is hot, dusty and grubby. You walk everywhere and if you go anywhere near a quad bike or a camel you need a massage. I doubt there are many like this in Marrakech. Spotless, tranquil, friendly and clearly are experts. Perfect."

I was a little nervous about getting my kit off for the experience and went in with my bikini on but the lady who performed my black salt scrub didn't give me the opportunity to be either shy or nervous and she was so matter of fact in the way she gestured to me to remove my bikini top that I instantly forgot my shyness. The massage wasn't like a remedial style massage but more of a relaxing carress style. If I were going again I would probably skip the massage and opt for a facial instead."

At all times the both of us were together in the same room, to start we went to a stone heated room where we were washed down, scrubbed with a mit, exfoliated and hair washed (we were just in bikini and boxers). We were then transferred to a massage room were we both had massages which were fantastic, my partner almost fell asleep she was so relaxed. This was the perfect end to our trip."

I am a very chatty person so I probably made them feel very uncomfortable? And I managed to fall asleep twice during my massage.What was really special to me was when one of the young girls took her time and patience to undo my really long plait and washed my hair with care! Also according to my watch treatment took much longer than it meant to be and no one seem to be stressed about it or rushing as out of the room for next people booked. It is essential to experience hammam while you in Marrakesh and let me just tell you: go for ISIS! It is worth it!"

We wanted 3 chocolate wraps and one massage. When we got to the spa however we were \"greeted\" by the owner I assume, a grumpy sour faced woman who immediately told us to shut up because we were not whispering as we came in - fine, but at least put a warning sign up or at the very least ask guests kindly with a smile, don't just bark at them as soon as they walk through the open door. This woman then informed us that we had booked 3 massages. No we had not. Cue small argument. She told us we couldn't have what we \"claimed\" to have booked as the spa and hammam was full. I think we must have been the only people there aside from one couple who I saw leave the massage room later. Instead she insisted the only treatment available was of course, the most expensive one. We couldn't have this because we had all just come with enough money for out treatment and a tip. Finally we found a half hour massage that we could have for the same price as the wrap. But to me, it was pretty obvious this woman was just trying it on which, along with her rudeness really wound me up. Not exactly how you want to feel in a place of relaxation. After telling us to be quiet she then proceeded to chatter loudly herself for several minutes on the telephone. My friend thought her massage was incredible. I found it irritating and like a gentle caress personally. Wouldn't recommend. If nothing else because of the owners attitude."

            "review": "hideous hammam followed by good massage. Riad staff showed this spa's flyer and booking through them would save me a lot of time and trouble, so I decided to go for it. We went for the couple package for 500dh/\u20ac50. It's a very reasonable price, but you get what you pay for. The hammam session was, honestly, so bad that I had to laugh every time the girls asked me 'good hammam?', not knowing if I should be honest or polite. Everything was so rushed, without a second to relax. My partner and I felt like dogs being washed. As soon as we got in the hammam room, the ladies applied savon noir and clay mask. This took literally 5 seconds. After a minute, they started scrubbing me, fast. Obviously my skin wasn't ready for that (- usually you should sit in the steam for at least 10 mins to soften the skin before you scrub). Therefore it was painful, and wasn't very successful. I could tell they just wanted to get each dog done as fast as possible. You pay 50DH at a local hammam and a big mama would give you a far better gommage, with care. Or even at home by yourself! I had been looking forward to the nice, fresh feel after a professional gommage, the feel when you have removed all the dead skin cells. So this was a huge disappointment.Moved to the massage room which was much cooler than the hammam, where we were left naked and half wet. I was freezing until they brought a towel to cover us. The background music was not my taste, not very relaxing.The massage was good. There were some moves that I really enjoyed, although I still hadn't recovered from the horrible hammam experience. I would have enjoyed it more if that didn't happen.Since we weren't provided with towels other than bathrobes, I was mentally preparing myself to go out with my hair wet. But when I asked, the team was happy to bring me to the hair-dressing room and kindly dried my hair. I thought it was very nice of them, and I left the spa happily.Overall, I guess it was ok for the price we paid. I liked the team, their smile and service. If only they took twice more time for the hammam session, this would have been a great experience."

            "review": "Small hammam but good experience . We were recommended this Hammam through our Riad as we didn't have time to look around. We were able to have the hammam booked out for us in the morning so there was nobody else there which was good because the hammam is too small for lots of people. We managed to get a good deal for use of the hammam, body scrub and a full body massage. Someone picked us up from the Riad and took us there on foot through the souks as it is based 10 mins away just off the Jemaa Al-Fna square. Upon first impression it doesn't look great as there is work going on outside but inside was decorated fine. There aren't a lot of photos of the place which we tried to research but inside they have gone for a dark, dimly lit atmosphere. Not quite sure why it is so dark as it was a hard to see to begin with! We were given robes and slippers to change into and then taken to the hammam. It is small compared to other hammams I've been to. There is a large slab in the middle where you lie down to have your scrub and then there is a small seating area but you wouldn't get more than 4 people in there without it getting too cramped. It took a while to steam up as we were first in. Our body scrub was very good, the lady who did it was thorough and scrubbed us top to toe! She even lathered us up and shampooed our hair, our skin felt great! The full body massage was also really good. We were in a room with two beds so we got massaged at the same time. We had been to Ourika valley the day before and were in pain from walking uphill. The two young girls doing the massages were thorough and also gave us deep tissue massages as requested. She even got up onto the bed and pulled me this way and that to properly stretch me! I've had massages before and would say that this was a really good one. Overall, I would recommend this spa if you would prefer a quieter spa experience and not looking for somewhere too fancy or luxurious. It does the job as the staff are good at what they do. We weren't expecting much to be honest when we saw the place but actually were pleasantly surprised and pleased too. The only issue is that they speak little English but we managed to get by and explain what we needed to."

The staff did not have one word of English between them, which was unhelpful but not the main problem.Went in at 2PM to book a 40 minute massage, 30 min hammam and body scrub for 5PM. Arrived at 5PM to discover that there were around 10 men in the queue, who of course went in ahead of us, which meant that we waited until 5:40PM for our session.Our 40 min massage lasted for 20 minutes, of average quality. After another 40 min wait to get into the actual hammam (hot bath room), we decided to give up and ask to leave, paying only 300 of the 500 Dirhams of the price. The rude receptionist insisted that our massage lasted 30 minutes, even though we said it lasted 20 or even less. We were offered an extra 30 min free massage but because the quality of the massage was so poor the first time we declined. We agreed that 400 Dirhams would cover the costs including the hammam which we desperately needed to wash all of the oil off our bodies. She agreed and dismissively told us to hurry up into the hammam as there were other people waiting.Wanted a relaxing spa experience and came out even more agitated and restless than we were going in. Don't know if everyone who has gone here/will go here will receive the same treatment but we think it's best that one doesn't risk it."

I had idea what a Hammam was before my trip to Marrakech and did not plan on getting one until I got covered with dust on an excursion just outside of the city. Hammam Ziani is just a short walk from the Jemaa el Fna, and was absolutely one of my favorite experiences during my short stay in the city/country. The experience was fantastic and was about 45 minutes - even if you are unlikely to visit a spa or get a massage (like me) it was a great way to see a new aspect of the culture here in Morocco. The owner is also fantastic, and is great to talk to if you are from the United States - he is originally from Morocco, but spent significant time in the States and is especially friendly and sociable to travelers. He gave us a great deal, great service, and was more than happy to answer any questions about the rest of our trip. There are probably higher quality, longer Hammams, but if you want a cheaper, quicker and still great alternative, come here!"

When we arrive the owner Damane Ziani welcomed us, we paid 250 dirham each (\u00a320) for a homage (scrub) and massage. We were each given a basket with bath robe and towel in and were taken into a small candle lit room for mint tea. Five minutes later I was taken to an anti room with lockers for my belongings (men and women go to separate areas) where I undressed and were given disposable knickers to hide my modesty. There could be other women in the Hammam at the same time so don't be shy. The ladies don't speak very good English but their gestures are adequate to understand. I was led into a room with marble type beds where I was washed with black soap and rinsed, then into the steam room for about fifteen minutes. Then back to the first room where I was scrubbed vigorously from head to foot, the amount of dead skin that comes off is unbelievable, washed again then taken to the massage room. I borrowed a towel from my hotel to put on the bed as they have plastic coverings and can be a bit slippery. Oil was applied and then I had the best massage ever including a head massage. Next I was led back to the first room where I was washed with a soapy scrunchy had my hair washed and conditioned and rinsed again. The women then helped me on with the bathrobe and wrapped the towel around my head and led me back to the anti room where I dressed. When we arrived the owner had said \"no tipping\" and there are signs all over, but the ladies do gesture for money and say \"sh\" not to tell the boss, but I gave my lady a tip as I thought she deserved it.We both felt clean, refreshed and relaxed and our skin was really soft and glowing. I would definitely recommend Hammam Ziani. Give it a go.Can't wait to return next year.Ps Damane has two beautiful little dogs called Rex and Rosie and a shop next door that sells natural oils and soap."

Then you lie down and they scrubbed u down. Feels like soft sandpaper. Then bucket bath. Then go to another room for oil massage. Then back to bucket bath. Then you lie down and they soap you down. Then final bucket bath. Then they give you bathrobe and you go change. Ladies bring hair tie. You will have to go back hotel to wash your oily hair.

            "review": "Authentic but impersonal . My husband and I booked an evening hammam session during our honeymoon and we chose Hammam Ziani for the reported authenticity - it being the only 'moroccan' Hammam and unlike a western spa. We were happy that they also provided men for men masseuses and women for women. Once I went into the women's section, they gave me a cloth to wrap around my chest and disposable underwear. However, perhaps due to a lack of English speakers that work at the Hammam, it seemed like they were not respectful or receptive to my own shyness about being without clothing. In previous spa experiences, there seems to be a bit more privacy, at least whereby the masseuse and yourself are in a room separate to other clients. I found it uneasy that there were 4 other customers getting the Hammam treatment at the same time in the same room.The steam room was nice and hot, and the scrub part was also nice with excellent exfoliation. Again, I think the communication skills were the biggest point to fix here - the people who work there are really lovely and sweet and well meaning, but a bit more basic English training would be so helpful! After the scrub was the massage, which was a good massage but from a personal perspective, being alone in that room and not knowing anyone or their language made me unable to fully experience the calm and comfort of the Hammam, and this could perhaps be rectified with a more personal treatment - or introduction of names from masseuses. All in all, I think if you're a shy person like me, then maybe opt for a more western style private Hammam - this one was authentic, but hygiene could be improved as there was lots of hair everywhere and the turnover between clients was too fast to clean massage beds etc. My husband had a good time as he was the only person being treated in the men's section, and had more of an individualised approach. Again hygiene was a slight issue, and this can be easily rectified if the Hammam take on fewer clients at one time and take more time to clean between them! All in all, thanks for our first Hammam experience, but not as spectacular as we were expecting."

We went in the evening to this beautiful and clean hammam with a bit of bartering on the door and decided to go for the gommage hammam without the massage as we had just been on a trek up to the summit of Mt Toubkal and wanted a good clean!My boyfriend had a great experience firstly being steamed, then showered, then scrubbed and pulled and stretched, showered, then soaped down kind of massaged and then steam room and showered again. He came out relaxed, happy and very clean.I however was firstly in the steam room and then scrubbed with a traditional mit and soap and then brought back to the steam room however the steam never came on so I lay for about 25 minutes in a mildly steamy room waiting to be collected. When i finally was I was quickly soaped off (the soap smelt amazing) and then left to get changed. Although I had definitely been scrubbed I was disappointed with my experience, especially compared to my boyfriend so we decided to go back the next day. When we explained the situation the man on the front desk was very understanding and explained that the staff were often exhausted by the end of the day during ramadan and he apologised a lot, offering another hammam which I turned down so then gave us a hammam mit and the best soap they had. Overall this was a good experience and I would recommend this place, but maybe be aware that your treatment may be rushed at the end of the day during ramadan."

You would then be taken to the shower and then they would put on a mud all over your body. You would then be asked to go to steam room for at least 15 minutes. Tip not to touch your eyes as it really stings. Then you would be taken for another shower. Then you would be asked to lay on those slippery covered mat massage table. Then you would be applied with oil and you would be scrubbed to almost having your skin peeled off. It was hard. Then another shower and then they would give you a massage that wasn't the best. At one point I thought I wouldn't be able to walk after as he kept on massaging my Achilles Tendon and it did hurt. That was the longest 30 minutes of my life. Then final shower and off you go. Though it was clearly posted everywhere not to tip but the masseure would still begged for it. You get a mint tea after that physical torture. It was just good to try but if I had gotten what I was told then I wasn't probably writing an average review. It was way too pricey for a lengthy wash."

Basically you are coming for a thorough cleanse but they also offer dry massage if you prefer.You enjoy a traditional mint tea after which you go to the changing rooms and lockers. You are provided with sandals and a small apron or towel. You shower first. Then a good coating of essential oils is applied and you start with a spell in the steam room followed by another shower. Your masseuse then gives you a really good oiling which helps remove the grime and dead skin. You are then scrubbed down, as hard or soft as you like!! Another shower and then a lengthy massage, finally a really good soapy wash and final shower.Although you are advised not to tip your guy does expect something as is usual throughout Morocco for any service. You can then relax with another tea before perhaps going for a walk and hearty meal!!Its an interesting experience but just a little pricey. Perhaps other hammams are cheaper so it might be worth shopping around!"

I'm a man, so this was the male experience:* Arrived and had price options explained to me. There are no baths, just the steam and massages. I chose the full package because it was only about $40 USD for 90 minutes.* Men massage the male customers. Women massage the female customers.* Changed clothes in a locker room. They gave me a towel/cloth to wrap around my waist so I wasn't naked at any time with the masseur or in the steam room. * Masseur washed me down with some soap and I led me to the steam room with the soap still on for about 10 minutes (hint, don't touch your eyes because the soap stings)* Masseur collected me from steam room, I rinsed off in shower, laid on table, got an incredible exfoliation for about 15-20 mins. They really scrub you with a loofah. Hard.* Next received a great massage. Like the best in my life. I was covered in some oil or soap that made it very slippery. The guy was great. I would guess this was about 30 mins* Then i got a mud cleansing. That could have been skipped but added another 20 mins to my experience. Rubbed some mud on me. Covered me in a plastic sheet to bake for 10 mins. * Masseur took me to the showers to rinse off. He scrubbed off the mud and oils.* Masseur hit me up for a tip at the end even those signs say no tips. I gave him the equivalent of about 5 USD.At no point wer my butt or other unmentionable areas touched. It was a very appropriate experience for shy Americans!Overall fantastic!"

I chose to visit here based on reviews on here and decided this would be the one for me ... additionally it was just around the corner from my Riad so saved getting lost ! I chose the popular 270 dirham package. I went mid morning and the place was pretty quiet. I got the customary tea and bottle of water and my bag with robe etc in it. As I didnt fancy the disposable knickers I wore my bikini bottoms and they were fine with that, although they did give me what is commonly known as a \"wedgy\" when doing their scrub lolYes it takes us uptight Brits out of our comfort zone - it's get your kit off and get oin with it. No need for embarrassment, this is just a job t them that they do every day and your body is not sexualised. I seen a lady here saying she felt uncomfortable because one of the hammam ladies undid her bra for her ... she was probably trying to be helpful and also wanting to get on with her job. it's US that are uptight about it, it's natural to them. Anyway, i digress.Into the steam room - wasnt too steamy but you can have it turned up no problem. out of there and into the \"bath\", washed with \"black soap\" (feels like silk on your skin), then given the exfoliation rub and boy do they do it well. Lots of dead skin off. it's not like a Turkish hamman where you are drowned in soapy bubbles, it's very different. Next - off to the massage room where I had the best massage of my life. I was oiled up and the lady's fingers got into, and inbetween, every muscle and boy did it feel good! Every part of my body was massaged, even my ears. Yes they do get close to the groin area but stop short of it and never once did I feel uncomfortable, worried or unsafe. You lie on a table that is covered in an oilcloth type cover that is slathered in oil ...it's slippy so sometimes you feel the need to hang on to the edges.After that back to the bath area to be washed down again and hair washed. Then back to the changing room, get dressed then off to the waiting room to have more tea if you wish.I wasnt aske donce for tips, although my masseus kept hanging around when I was getting dressed and smiling at me so I guess she was wanting something, however a big crowd of women had just come in so she was then busy with themMy whole experioence lasted almost two hoursI can safely say it was the best 270 dirhams I spent in MarrakechI'm going back to Marrakech in two weeks time and this place will be my first stopdo it ...throw away any inhibitions and just go for it ... you'll love itI loved this place and felt like annew person when I was"

The ladies were very professional and I felt I was in good hands, It was well organised and you only had to bring new clean clothing with you as they provided you with a bath robe, towel and disposable pants.

She had been 3 times and said all 3 times she had nothing but positive experiences. We went as a group of 4 and we were treated like royalty from the moment we got in. We were sat down, given Moroccan tea and a bottle of water each & then were told in detail about the packages they had to offer. It's strictly segregated for men & women which we were very pleased with. We put our stuff away in the lockers and taken to sauna/steam room. The ladies were so jolly and we had loads of giggles with them. They aren't very fluent in English but we managed just fine. We paid 330 dirhams (roughly \u00a323.50) for 30min sauna/steam, hammam scrub, 45min almond oil massage, mud wrap and bath. It was a very relaxing 2hr session. The scrub and massage were AMAZING. The women work really hard and give 110%. Overall it was a bargain and we all loved it and would definitely go again. Our hotel spa charged 350 dirhams just for a 30 min massage. What a rip off! This place is value for money, I highly recommend it! P.S - we were not hassled for tips at all. We paid up front and got great service."

I've been to hamam before and I expected not to be wearing clothes, but it was a bit unnerving to have one of the female staff unhook my bra FOR me as I got undressed. I brushed it off. They give you a disposable thong to \"cover up\" - which I really wasn't sure if they were new or just washed and put back into a plastic bag. It was massive and didn't fit, which is slightly uncomfortable if you expected to be a tad covered; really it was for show. The steam room was fine, but the small pads to sit on looked like they hadn't been washed in ages and with the tiny thong, I was especially glad to be scrubbed down after. The woman who walked me through was pleasant, though a bit invasive, rubbing all the way up the crotch (though she did stop when asked, good). I hadn't expected having a naked massage lying a foot away from another client and her friend as they were also being massaged. The staff were chatting and giggling to each other the whole time and I also had to firmly tell the practitioner to stop massaging my breasts. The rest of the massage was fine, and I enjoyed the wash down/shampoo after. It just wasn't as relaxing as anticipated."

We went for the 270 dirham per person package - which included use of the hammam/steam room, a traditional scrub and an oil massage.It's a traditional hammam so men and women go separately, but there is also a cabin for private couples massages if you prefer.I was taken into the ladies dressing room, where I was given disposable underwear, slippers and a robe to put on, before being lead through to the sauna. Glass windows allow shafts of coloured light in, creating a magical misty atmosphere. After about 10-15minutes a lady came and collected me, taking me through to a room with beds in, where she washed me down before giving me my scrub. I particularly enjoyed the foot scrub - so she did it twice! Then I was lead through to the massage room - half an hour of pure bliss. I almost fell asleep! After this it was back to the previous room for another wash down (and they even shampooed my hair!). Then tea and more biscuits in the relaxation room.

We were taken to another place by our taxi ( as is often done in Marrakech! - everyone knows the best place for tourists- they charged more so we stuck to our plan and are so pleased we did). Men and women use different areas. We went in the morning. It was quite and there was no one but my sister and myself (and the lady staff) in the place. We went for the full package at 350 dirhams and were delighted. Lovely women ( didn't speak English but we could communicate well enough) -doing our hamame and great massage. Also had a mud wrap,and steam room treatment that was bliss. The place is so relaxing. We were in there a couple of hours at least. A real highlight of our trip to Marrakech. Would love to go again and would definitely go back to Hamame Ziani at the earliest opportunately .highly recommend it."

To start with the worst part of the Ziani experience: After a horrible 2 hours in Hammam Ziani, we went to a shop right next to Ziani Hammam (same building as Hammam Ziani, sells towels, body lotions, oil etc.) what we saw there in the shopping area was unbelievable!!! There was a screen with live video surveillance from the locker rooms in Ziani Hammam. We could see naked customers in the locker room!! Anyone who goes to that store can see this screens and see the customers in the changing rooms!!! Something like that should be forbidden!!! Ziani experience: My friend and I were looking for a relaxing massage and therefore stopped at Hammam Ziani. They explained that they offer a 1h20min Hammam experience for 27 Euros. Since we only wanted to have a massage, we asked if it was possible to skip the Hammam and just get a massage. It was possible so we booked 2 massages for 15 minutes later. When we came back we had to wait in the waiting area. Nobody told us how long we have to wait, so after 10 minutes we asked them. After 10 more minutes we could go to the locker rooms. After that a woman brought us and two other girls to the steam bath. We were surprised that we would go to the steam bath given the fact that we booked a massage and not a Hammam. The steam bath was really grubby. We had to sit on uncleaned plastic mats without a towel or something... After another 5 minutes we asked why we are here since we actually booked a massage. The women were very surprised when we told them that we had only booked a massage, so they send us back to the steam bath. After a couple of minutes they brought us to a room with 5 massage tables. It was so cold that both of us were freezing. The tables we covered with white plastic, they were still oily and there was still hair on the plastic from the previous customer. They asked us to lay down. We both found it really grose but since we were there for a massage... we did it. The massage itself was ok. Not very good, but ok. BUT... it was sooo cold and it was so loud! There were always people in the room, new customers coming and going, different staff coming and going, i had several people touching my legs because they passed by my table. It was absurd. After the massage, they washed us with an old sponge (they even put it in our faces!!). Then we got some old and wet towels to dry ourselfs!!! After 2 hours we left the Hammam and the only thing we wanted was a hot shower!!"

The place is very clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful. It's not a spa experience, that's not a criticism, just so you are aware that it's a traditional Hammam where you are steamed, scrubbed and massaged firmly. You leave feeling revitalised and fresh. It is excellent value, similar places seem to be charging almost double the amount."

It was what I had expected (the cleanliness, the staff, the package and the treatments).However, I have a few qualms about the place:1. My sister later informed me that only two options were available in French and English - the 270 DH treatment, and the \u2018full\u2019 package at something around 350 DH (which includes a seaweed wrap). However, options in Arabic showed one treatment that costs 120 DH. Now, I knew the star-studded clientele was a mere marketing ploy, which was not the primary reason we chose this hammam; however, after finding out the price differences, I feel as though we may have unknowingly paid for a marketing stunt we did not want to be part of.2. The constant loud chatter by the Moroccan women. Not as peaceful as I'd like. 3. As we retreated to the tea area by the reception, the owner came in to give orders to a Moroccan woman known as \u2018Nina\u2019. It was in Arabic so I could not understand a word, however, to a non-Arabic guest, it came across as loud, crass, and frankly, embarrassing. It was not the \u2018relaxation area\u2019 they claim it to be, with the owner constantly calling (read: shouting) for \u2018Nina\u2019 from the door of the hammam to one of the back rooms.These are my only qualms for Hammam Ziani. It is definitely a \u2018mid-range\u2019 hammam; it was not public yet the women were not clad in an all-white attire. However, 270 DH is a little steep to pay for the experience - it is definitely catered for tourists and Western pockets."

He then went in and checked with his staff, and told me that I could get the massage done. So I got the massage done. But in the end, it was frustrating, as I had to get dressed to come outside, and then get changed again to go back in for the massage, and get dressed again after everything. It delayed me a lot (and I was there with my 2 year old and wanted to get back to the hotel soon). Surprising how they just forgot that I had paid for a full package and were not even apologetic!"

Hammam Ziani was a good entry point to an authentic hammam, without the crowds of local women chatting away as they scrub themselves. The masseuse was a genius, saying I must have a bad headache (I did!) because I was holding a lot of tension in my neck, and within minutes she had worked it out. It is not a luxury spa experience, and you might not want to look too closely at the surroundings, but all in all it's a good experience and well worth going. On a side note, I did have some sort of reaction to the clay mud mask, but I do have sensitive skin, so I put that down to my own fault not theirs."

I felt compelled to write a review today as we booked our flights to Marrakech again (2nd holiday to Morocco! 1st was in July 2015) and the only place I can think I'll avoid in Marrakech is THIS FILTHY, DIRTY PLACE! THIS IS NOT A HAMMAM! It's a disgusting building full of dirt and all things gross, like pubic hair and dirt! My sincere apologies to all people reading this, I do not usually use caps when writing, indeed it's seen as shouting! I do feel like shouting right now!Right, cut a long story short, on our second evening in Marrakech, we went here after seeing it's ranked no.9 in the Spa's and Wellbeing section!I made an awful decision going there and the fact that I still remember the awful time and the horrid filth I saw in Hammam Zaini, months on, is proof enough that it affected me in a very bad way.Paid for a 1hr40minute package, got a 1hr10min (if that) of nothing, almost nothing. My brother paid extra for a more luxurious scrub, and longer massage - he was out, sitting in the waiting room, before My mother and I were changed and out!The nicest bot of this hammam is the communal waiting room. Once inside the hammam, you will find it's dirty, smelly. They rush you through the whole hammam, not even rubbing the black gommage stuff on you, they make you do it yourself, then ask you to go sit in a hot room, as I sat, there was brown gross stuff on the benches, looked to right and left and there was PUBIC HAIR lots of it! That hot room hadn't been cleaned for at least a month at least!They leave you in there ages, then bring you out, tell you to splash yourself with water, tell you to lay down on a plastic table covered with a plastic dinner table cover - this has been previously used and they tell you, get on it without cleaning it or anything!The woman then and gave me a 10 minute massage! when my package clearly stated 25 minutes, then demanded tips...right by the sign it says no tips!Please save your money, avoid this! I am going to be in Marrakech next month, I am going to try Hammam De La Rose this time and I'll report back.If anyone reading this wants to advise me on a good hammam to go to, please message me. I'd appreciate that."

I think this is my first negative review anywhere.What we were told would happen on the street before we we went in was nothing like what we experienced:- An hour an a half of hammam, gommage and massage lasted a whirlwind 35 minutes and we were dressed and in the street again.- The kit we were given had a new exfoliating scrubbing glove in - that we never saw. I realised too late and had already been covered in other people's dead skin - yuck!- The place looks lovely from outside and even going in. But the massage tables are slimed up plastic covered in other people's hair and dead skin.- The gommage was super fast and done to get us out ASAP, and the massage was on yet another dirty and slimy plastic massage table.It is way too over priced and I feel robbed of an amazing Moroccan hammam experience. I would highly urge everyone to keep walking and find a nicer more authentic and hygienic hammam.Do not be fooled by how friendly people are before you go in. I'm sure they are lovely people, but the whole thing is designed to get as many foreigners in and out as possible. Relaxing? The total opposite!"

If you are expecting pink fluffy towels and spa music you are in the wrong place but that's not what its all about, if you want to relax in the steam room and follow that with a scrub, massage and wash down then that's what you get. I would definitely go again. In short, ladies and gents are separated, yes you walk around topless in your disposable pants, yes the ladies to take you by the arm to lead but not in an unpleasant manner. Yes the massage tables are covered in plastic but just relax and go with the experience. The ladies are lovely, it wasn't overly rough at all and I came out smiling"

Very friendly man who told us he was born in Casablanca but grew up in San Franciso. He spoke several languages very well including English. He took the time to tour us through the hamman and explained the service to us. We had our 2 children ages 8&11 with us and we wanted to find a hamman that would be suitable for all. We were impressed with the cleanliness of the facility and the time he took to talk us through the experience. We even enjoyed some tea and he gave us some suggestions on what we should see and do in Marrakech. Based on this, we decided to come back the next day for the service. Big mistake! We arrived and the owner was not present however they welcomed us in. Children were supposed to be half price (clearly marked on the price sheet) but they charged us 200dh instead of 175dh. No explanation and our fault for not questioning. As we were 2 males and 2 females we were separated and each taken to our own sections. At check in we were given baskets containing robes, disposable underwear, new gloves(for the scrubbing). Once in the change room, the attendant helped us to disrobe (very awkward for a Westerner but we assumed this is just how it goes). No robe and nothing for our chests. The owner had told us clearly that we would be given cloths to cover our breasts. We were taken into a shower room and were doused with hot water than told to lie on the ceramic tables where they covered us with the \"black soap\". There was very little product on us and then we were told to go into the sauna. It was just me and my daughter as the spa was empty. The sauna was warm at best and the steam only hit our faces so we were actually feeling cold. They left us there for quite a long time. So long that we actually called out to see if they had forgotten us. They came back and said 2 minutes. It was another 10 before they returned. We were taken back to the ceramic table and the scrubbing began. I noticed that the glove used was not the same one as was in my basket (different color) and I quickly figured out it was not a new glove, but a used one they pulled from a bucket. Gross! We were scrubbed down and they chatted very loudly the entire time so it was not relaxing. They then took us into the massage room which contained 4 tables covered with cracked plastic. They were dirty, covered in hair and skin. When they realized we noticed, they quickly rinsed them off. We were covered in thick oil and then we had to hang onto the table sides as we both felt we would slide off otherwise. Not relaxing at all! Once the massage was done we were taken again to the ceramic tables to be rinsed off. At this point they washed our hair and then used a very stiff brush to get out the tangles. The brush came out of the same bucket as the scrubbing gloves. They then told us we were finished and she wrapped me In a robe. I put my hands in the pocket and found a used Kleenex. Again, disgusting. Once we were dressed, there was no one anywhere so we went into the tea room to find the rest of our family. No one ever came back so we poured our own tea which was cold. My husband and son were both asked for tips and there are sign everywhere clearly stating \" no tips\". Obviously we did not tip. This was a horrible experience, dirty and impersonal. Do yourself a favour and pay the extra money to go to a proper hamman. As a side note, my daughter had a reaction to the soap (was very itchy during the sauna) and my face broke out after all the heavy oil that was used."

I have nothing to compare this experience to, I only went because I was told that it was the ultimate Moroccan experience. I paid 350 for the entire package (I believe there's a student discount too). This included getting a shower, being put in the sauna for a long time (the sides weren't too hot but the middle section was), getting scrubbed (it was quite gross to look at all the dead skin afterwards), being massaged (mine was quite rough and made my body snap a few times, but everyone else thought it was could've been rougher. I don't know if I got a rough massage or if it was rougher than than the others - this could be replaced by seaweed therapy), getting a clay treatment, and tea at the end!I thought the experience might be weird and awkward but sometimes I'd look at the lady in the eyes to see if she thought it was weird and awkward and she would often just flash me a bright, motherly smile which made me feel better about the whole experience.This hammam is right next to Palais Bahia (kind of sandwiched between both the square and the Palace) and would recommend it as a convenient and nice spot. I was told that it wasn't an authentic experience since the \"real\" experience would all happen in one room and they'd lay me down on the floor for a cheaper price, but I thought it was a good introduction to whole \"having someone wash you\" and \"spending 3 hours naked with other girls\". The awesome:-There are signs everywhere saying that \"Tips are prohibited\" which is nice considering that everyone else in Marrakesh will ask you for one. -There's a hair dryer (included) and argan oil cream that you can use afterwards (also included). The bad:-I'm not sure the ladies there speak French. This experience might be a little harder for those who don't speak French (you'll have to do a lot of guessing with their gestures and body language).-The whole experience was 3.5 hours long. My friend and I had someone almost alert the police that we went missing because we didn't think this would take more than 2 hours."

My two companions had a better massage.The scrub which I thought would be more aggressive was again very weak so I don't imagine would have taken any substantial skin off. I think it really depends on who you get.During the massage the workers were a bit chatty, but when one of my companions joked that she wanted to sleep, the workers quitetened down.Considering we were semi naked having these treatments, I was horrified to see and hear a man walking back and forth outside the massage room. This was very disappointing considering we were told it was separate for ladies and men.There was no one available to complain to at the end so I cut my losses and left.If you want a cheap and cheerful experience without the luxury experience then this is the place for you."

We were shown around the hammam when we got there, and then the man on reception (who could speak perfect English, and had the cutest dogs! He even went and got his new puppies so we could have a cuddle with them!) explained the 2 packages we could have. We went for the hammam and half hour massage, which took about an hour and a half or there abouts, and cost us about \u00a318. You could have a longer experience for a little bit more, which included a wrap/body mask and a longer massage. We waited in a room where we had mint tea before being sent through to the changing rooms, where we were handed flip flops and a TINY paper thong. I am a size 20 and they fit me, they are stretchy so if you are slightly bigger, don't worry! We then had loads of water thrown over us and then shown the steam room, then more water and a scrub, then another go in the steam room, then an amazing massage, possibly the hardest one I have ever had, but it was so good! Then we had a hair wash and laid on a concrete bed and had yet more water poured over us to get rid of the oil from the massage. The ladies that worked in there were very sweet and guided you from place to place, and had a laugh with us too! It was definitely an experience, and you must do it when you are in Marrakech!"

I did not want the feeling of being in a \"posh spa\" because I could have that here in the uk any time I want . I didn't want the stress of going to a traditional locals hammam which would require me to take my own hammam kit and where I would feel so inconspicuous that it would not be relaxing at all. So Hammam Ziani makes a perfect middle ground. I loved the massage and body scrub . Trotting around with just paper pants on was a little out of my comfort zone but in an odd way quite liberating !!!! I was not asked for a tip and for that reason I did give one ."

I read some of the reviews before visiting Hammam Ziani, but no matter all the detailed descriptions the treatment my friend and I had there came as a big surprise and is definitely a memorable one. We showed up around 8 pm knowing that they are open till 10 pm and asked for the package that includes mud wrap and lasts 2 hours. First we were escorted to the ladies' changing room and given slippers, thongs and a dressing gown to put on. When we were ready were led a room where we got splashed by buckets of warm water and then to the steam room where we had to wait a while. It was a bit noise due to the steam machine hidden somewhere near to it and the temperature was just okay, not really warm though. We were asked to return to the room for a very thorough scrub then splashed again and directed to the massage room where we received a top of our heads to the end of our toes oil massage that was very strong. Then we had to return to the steam room and lay down to have our bodies covered in mud then wrapped in foil. The steam came on again as it was turned off when no one was in and we were waiting in our mummy wrap. In the end we got thoroughly washed and soaped and splashed and could leave feeling completely refreshed.I only recommend this experience to those who like firm massage, who are not shy and happy with women staff touching them almost everywhere (both the wash and the massage is front and back) and don't mind indelicate treatment."

First there was a cup of tea, after I had to take off my clothes of and a man tied a small scarf around my waist. The Hammam started with a steam room (with not so much steam), after I got my personal guy putting soap on me ans scrubbing me. Finally there is a full body massage which was good. The beds where not so comfortable (plastic, quite hard) without privacy (3 beds in a cramped room with other people) and the masseuses talking with each other. You see signs with 'no tips' everywhere, but still I got asked for it multiple times afterwards. The whole experience took about 1 hour. I have been to a Hammam in Turkey 1 time before, so maybe I don't have good comparison or this is the more traditional one. However I think I won't go again.Some positive points: my girlfriend quite enjoyed it (more privacy, no asking for tips, nicer massage) and you get all stuff provided. The price is reasonable."

You will be scrubbed, rubbed and left feeling brand new.The massage and scrubbing are not gentle however that is what the hammam is about! The owner was very nice I was feeling dizzy and he brought me water and asked a host to watch me as I would be in the steam room.I recommend this hammam , everything is very upfront and efficient. If you dobt know the process do ask for a breakdown where you pay. Staff English is non existent (french is perfect) but really what do you expect the women to say to you whilst your nearly nude and they are scrubbing off your dead skin? Yes they do hold you by your arm, I think it's done so you don't slip whilst walking and go onto the right place for the right treatment. The women mean you no harm, everything that they can do for you to make your time pleasant they do, from attempting to put slippers on your feet, helping put your items in a locker to wrapping your towel around you when you finish.I enjoyed my massage, it was rough but relaxing, it didn't remind me of a swedish or a sports massage. They rub everything and if you do not want something done just gesture and then add 'no'. I had a great time as did my mum we left glowing.Yes in the changing area it says no tips, I think it's written as some tourists where frustrated with being asked. You can say NO but I am sure if you know what service to expect and base it on the service you receive and how refreshed you'll feel you will want to. The ladies aren't expecting anything big if you go with expecting to tip 20dh and very rough but loving treatment the experience will very pleasant and unlike the horror stories of the lower stared reviews.Enjoy your hammam experience!"

You start by relaxing with tea, then a lady takes you to get changed into a disposable thong they give you. She then leads you to get washed down and then puts you into a sauna. After the sauna you get scrubbed down to get rid of the dead skin, real good scrub! Then you have a massage and after, another wash down. They also washed my hair and platted it for me.

On arrival the friendly multilingual staff explain the facilities and cost which is good value for facilities like this aimed at giving tourists an authentic experience. The facilities are separate for men and women. After changing into small garments (paper pants for ladies and what can only be described as a very small sarong for men) you are lead through to the hammam. After time relaxing in the steam you are scrubbed, washed, massaged and washed again with great efficiency while still being looked after and allowed time to relax. Although the outfits aren't exactly dignified the staff ensure you feel at ease. All of the staff in the hammam are extremely polite and helpful. I would recommend anyone visiting Marrakech should try the hammam for an authentic experience at a reasonable price. The massage was one of the best I've had (even better than in some of the decent UK spas) and the staff were excellent - if you have any issues such as bad back/neck speak to the staff on reception who will explain to the others so that they are careful to accommodate this (my mum really appreciated their care)."

On day 3 I insisted on a massage through a Hammam and used trip advisor to search and get reviews for Hammam's in Marrakech. There were some that are highly rated but the time and price (\u20ac90) didn't suit me so thought it wasn't going to happen. After a visit to Palace Bahia, the wife and I decided to walk to the Souk. A 2 minute walk from the Palace my wife spots Hammam Ziani. We decided to check it out. Reception was great. Tea offered for free and we were shown the Hammam. We said we weren't sure and the gentleman said no obligation but I insisted to the wife that we make an appointment. Gentleman said when you're ready just make your way over. I had checked the price during the conversation and it was 270 Dirhams or approximately \u00a318 for the hour treatment which included steam room, scrub, rinse, massage and final rinse/shower. Didn't make the Hammam on day 3 but returned day 4 and the gentleman remembered me. Arrived at 10.30am and finished at 12pm. So, all of the above included and you can dictate how hard or soft you want the massage and scrub, or areas to focus on. Wife wasn't well on day 4 so sat inside being offered tea with no charge.In summary an absolute delight and well worth the treatment. I left the Hammam lost for words. It's hard to describe the feeling of relaxation when you leave. It has to be an experience you have to have. The wife and I will be back no doubt. An absolute pleasure and a great experience when it comes to customer service. Well done Hammam Ziani."

We went with no expectations and were very pleasantly surprised.Ziani met us at the door and showed us around before we decided to go ahead. We went for the full treatment and sat in the quiet area with a cold bottle of water (supplied) to await our treatment.After 5 minutes we were taken to the changing area where we were supplied with a loin cloth and robe and stored our clothes in a lockable, but not too sturdy, locker (be sensible and don't take valuable items anywhere in Marrakech). From there we showered and shown to the steam room and soaped up with the dark soap and left to sweat. Steam room was hot but recommend sitting up high as the room was quite tall so best heat at the top. We were then taken to the table and scrubbed down with the mitten and showered. After this we were covered in oil and a very thorough massage. After that we were covered in almond mud, wrapped up and left to relax, and the mud to take affect, for a while. Finished off by being washed and soaped with lovely hot water and sponge. At all times we felt well looked after and guided and couldn't fault the experience, especially when you consider the price (250 dirhams each for two hours of attention with their August Special offer). There was just four men when we visited, it might be a bit more rushed/crowded in peak season but great when we went. This place is not a \"Spa\" but you do feel you're getting an insight into a traditional Hammam without feeling too much of a tourist. We'd highly recommend anyone visit (they have separate Hammams for men and women so unable to comment of the woman's). Great place, Great value, Great Experience!"

Some places make you buy a bucket, black soap and scrubbing mit. Not here, all included.If you head there with the right frame of mind you will have an amazing time. This is a public Hammam, so you will be surrounded by other naked people of your gender. They will provide with a pretty small thong and sandals. And then you'll go through the process of getting washed, steamed, scrubbed, massaged and washed again. This place isn't fancy but it's very relaxing and the people that work there put their back into it! My massage and scrub were amazing and a week later my skin still is so soft. I recommend this on the 1st of 2nd day you arrive, in order to prepare your skin for a nice tan also the scrubbing will be really painful if you are sun burnt! If you can get comfortable quickly with nudity, and you are ok with getting washed and massaged you'll definitely enjoy this. Is a very different experience but very relaxing and fun none the least.

Man who speaks English very well, told us that we will get 1h 30min hammam experience including scrubing and 30min massage for 270 dirhams (25 eur).We were so looking forward to authentic hammam experience and couldn't wait to try it. What we got is 45min being there all together in this very filthy place with pubic and other hair laying on the massage bed, even the towels they gave us were used and dirty. Therapist who distroyed us in 15min very deep tissue massage, without and warming up muscles so we were aching all night and day with bruises, massage lasted 15min ( She did it like She was angry on us) and they were pushing us from one room to other, grubbing us for upper arm like we are kids and forcing us to hurry up... At the end they were pressuring us for TIPS, even with big printed signs everywhere \" No tips!\"I tried to talk with someone there but suddenly no one spoken English, French and Arabic only! Customer care is present only during the booking and charging for service, they are all smiley there but this place needs to be closed down forever and owners should be punished for robbing tourists!Stay away from this dirty horrible nasty place of horror and tell everyone else to avoid it if you don't want to get skin desease or bruises from horrible massage.this experience spoiled our last day of holiday and We are still in pain from massage."

When we returned, the staff were lovely; it does help to be able to speak/understand a little french (no English spoken) but this really was not a problem, they just guide you along gently. Be prepared to strip almost naked - the 'thong' provided doesn't make much difference but there are very separate men and women sections so no embarrassment! The scrub/steam/massage/wash down/hair wash was blissful and very relaxing - I could have easily drifted off to sleep. Wrapped up in a big towel robe, then a refreshing mint tea to end, before facing the heat and onslaught of the souks again! 270dh/\u00a320 for around 80-90 mins - very good value and highly recommended."

The first we have have experienced as a couple and as a spa. When we visited Hammam Zianni, we had a lot to compare with. To help you choose, I have written the points we liked below:1. It is a nice practical and value for money experience.2. It is clean, friendly, simple and efficient with good quality materials used.3. It is not a posh spa so don't expect that and you won't be disappointed. That is not to say it was not spa like, it was friendly which to me aren important especially when you are only wearing some modest plastic pants, you don't want to feel awkward and the experience was really relaxing.4. We did the normal rub down with savoun beldi, wait in steam area and then scrub down, rinse and onto massage table. Had a great massage followed by a full body mud mask. Then washed hair and next scrub, wash down and finish. Really worth every penny. They have hair dyers and I did not have to wait to use it. I suspect that if lots finish at same time you could have a rush...5. We went at 3.00pmish and I had the place to myself. It started to fill up when I was leaving at 5.00pm ish.Book it you will enjoy the experience and the friendly people at the Hammam."

I personally don't like too much hammams with a \"Spa character\". I love the real oriental feeling of being in such an authentic and characteristic place as hammam Ziani getting my traditional washing and a very good and strong massage like the moroccan women are used to have it since hundreds of years. For me it's not just a beauty program! It's leaving the noisy world outside for an hour or two, being on my own, receiving this archaic method of washing and scrubbing the body and maybe also the mind. Entering the hammam, it's a little bit like going back into your mothers womb. Naked, dark, moisturized, warm and tender. The old skin gets off, and we are coming out again like a new born baby. I've also tested several other hammams. But always I got less service for double price. Especially the massage was more like a caress with oil. At Hammam Ziani the massage is the best I've ever had! Very good price performance ratio! No reservation needed. You simply drop in, whenever you feel like. You will be very satisfied and tired afterwards. So maybe try to make it in the evening and drink some water, before you go! I'm sure you will have an unforgettable experience!"

            "review": "Pretty friendly with foreigners but still authentic enough. This place is by no means a \"real\" neighbourhood hammam, it is mainly oriented to foreigners, as it is a little bit more upscale (without really being fancy) and you don't really have to know the ritual in order to do your thing (which could be a little bit frustrating the first times you do it), so, if you are looking for a nice relaxing time before you leave Morocco or are a trying to ease yourself into the Hammam experience, this place is for you. We decided to go right after our return from a few days camping in the desert and and excruciating 10 hour long drive back from the Sahara, we were in need for something relaxing. There is people giving out flyers outside this place virtually the whole day. We had one and decided to go there early-ish the next day; it was pretty hard to find again, but the tip is to get to the Palace first and walk from there. You can pay either in Euros or Dirhams, which was pretty convenient cause it was our last day and we didn't want to change more money (beware that the conversion rate is not the best, but we were happy with it), we ended up paying 25 EUR each for the basic service (hammam, scrubbing and massage), they give you a little basket with towel, robe, a loincloth and the scrub thing they use (so you don't really need to bring anything). They will guide you to a waiting room and feed you the customary mint tea. My girl and I got separated from there (for obvious reasons). They have a changing room with lockers where you pretty much strip down naked and put on the loincloth (the girls get one of those one use disposable panties) and they direct you in. You should take a quick shower to clean up a bit and go to the steam room, it could have been a bit hotter but it was perfectly ok. The black olive oil soap is given upon your entrance to the steam room (take a generous amount) and you can soap yourself or wait for someone to do it for you. Once you are done there, it is scrubbing time, and IT IS AWESOME, they will remove all the impurities and dark thoughts you carry with you. You need to turn and rinse every now and then... the people speak French and basic English but its simple enough, they will point and tell... its a no brainer. Then they will massage you with oils, and pretty strongly too, which is something I really appreciate. The place is not private and you might have a few of your fellow travelers getting massages next to you, but that does not bother me. Besides, this IS NOT A FANCY SPA, it is more similar to traditional hammams. That is it, the whole thing might take a bit over one hour, you might get a longer massage expecting a tip (I will address this in the next parragraph).The place has signs everywhere about the NO TIPPING policy. But regardless you will be asked for tips a couple of times, I have no problem with this if i got a great service, which I did, so I sneaked back in to give the guy a couple EUR. But this is entirely up to you, you will not be harassed or anything. You can now get out and get a tea while you wait for the rest of the people with you. My girl was in fact waiting for me already while sipping some more tea, she had a similarly great experience, it seems that the only thing that really differed was that she got panties and i got a loincloth. We were really happy and will come back for sure."

She apparently was the boss of the other ladies, and scrubbed, washed and kneeded like a heroine! She was also a very nice lady, and totally professional. I did not feel that the hammam was particularly dirty, as others have mentioned.The details have been given by other reviewers, but I payed 270 dhirams may -15 for the basic package (about 1h 20min, without mud wrapping).

We're not big spenders and had been put off by some of the high end spas in the city catering chiefly for tourists, but were convinced we'd feel like wallies rocking up to a local hammam and not knowing our ar**s from our elbows (so to speak!). Easy to find right by the Bahia Palace, Hammam Ziani provides the perfect in-between solution. We went for the 350 dh option, including a steam room session, scrub, argan oil massage (1 hr for my friend, 30 mins for me + a mud wrap) and a good wash. The ladies giving us our treatments were wonderful and made us feel like we were in safe hands. Being lead by the hand from room to room, lubed up on argan oil, naked save a pair of tiny paper pants and slopping about in ill-fitting plastic sandals has never been more fun. After we'd dressed and finished giggling about how nice it had all been (I hadn't been washed like that since I was about three) we were shown to a sumptuous sitting area where fresh mint tea awaited us. A seriously nice treat. The most money we'd spend in all our five days in Marrekech, but worth every dirham. (oh and apparently a good scrub, and Hammam Ziani certainly gives you that, means more chances of getting a better tan afterwards - bonus!)"

This is probably the first place I have visited in morroco to make me feel at home, having spent two days with my two friends in marrakech the owner Ziani was a fresh friendly face who made us all welcome with a glass of morrocan mint tea. The price of the full hammam was 270DH which is a very reasonable price considering it last for 1h15! Some of the tourist hammams offer around 650DH for 50mins!.As a darkskinned women I am more than used to the stares and glares but the ladies here were wonderful and gave us the best treatments and massage. The owner went to the extra mile of helping us discover more of the old town on map and explained everything from how to haggle for a camel and also were to go out at night (something our hotel lacked in). Afte our hammams there was a pleasant mint tea awaiting us. The owner and the overall hammam is definately a must we left grinning from ear to ear and thats definately more than expected. Thank you mr ziani we will be sure to come back next time we visit!"

Set between the Bahir and the Badi palaces (not quire sure I've spelled those correctly) we found the Ziani by accident and was that our lucky day. We checked the hammam out before going to the Bahir palace and went to it between palaces. We had previously declined going to another hammam (advertised as reasonably priced by some Trip Advisors please note) because with a massage it would have cost us nearly `1000 dirhams. The Ziani, on the other hand only cost us 270 dirhams with a massage (January) and when I say massage, the one I had by Karim was the best massage I had ever had. I went with a girl friend and we both enjoyed the experience so much so if you are looking for somewhere clean, authentic, very reasonably priced and with lovely friendly staff do get yourself to the Ziani."

Since you go in naked and have other people to wash and scrub you, this could have been uncomfortable, but in fact it was rather nice. The scrub and massage in itself was comfortable (and you got super silky smooth afterwords) but I had a minor clash with the masseurs after they were done. The hammam had a 'no tip policy' but the three ladies that worked there actually begged me to tip them. I didn't really know what to do, and it made me quite uncomfortable. I also froze a bit in there all the way through."

They fitted us in right away, explained the different options available, and although clearly geared towards tourists it felt fairly authentic to us. The sexes are segregated here, unlike at the more exclusive westerns spas in town, and the scrub I received was one of the best ever. I wasn't asked for a tip by my masseur either, who was really friendly and explained what to do next etc. So for anyone wanting to experience an authentic Moroccan hammam without going fully native, and if you are prepared for it to not be the same as the service you will get in a western spa, then this is a good place for you. I would definitely visit again."

            "review": "Better than other Marrakech hammams, but needs to improve for the price. I went as a treat at the end of a 2-week backpacking trip. Overall it was worth it, but it could have been better considering the price.Visit: you can take a quick free tour and see into the change room and treatment rooms to get an idea of the warmth & steam. Front desk gentleman during the day was amazingly kind & pleasant. When I went in the evening a different gentleman was not at all polite & simply asked me to pay immediately and then sent me in with a staff member. As a paying customer, that was not appreciated.Pros : Better than most of the other Hammams off the side streets. Others from my Riad went to one suggested by the riad for 200 dirhams, but they were massaged in a cold room and only had a hot shower. Sort of defeats the purpose of the hammam/steam! At least Ziani is warm.Cons: Steam room for relaxing should be hotter. It was warm, but not hot. The service really depends on the attendant you're paired with. My actual treatments were shorter than they should have been. My scrub was only a few minutes at most & not as thorough as it should have been. My massage was rough, not thorough, and definitely not 30 minutes;10-15 minutes maximum. So that was too bad. Another gentleman with another attendant had the same package as me but received a longer more thorough treatment.270 dirhams for basic package (scrub, \"30\" minutes massage, steam, hot showers, body oil). No restricted men vs. Women hours as they're completely separate. Don't need to bring your own undergarments to this hammam as you're given a loin cloth and slippers. Tip:I was given the dark gel to rub into my feet in the hammam. Seriously don't get this anywhere near your eyes OR touch above your neck after. I ran my fingers through my hair and some residue must have leaked onto my face as I sweat : serious stinging.Note: the business posts clearly that tipping is forbidden. I was still repeatedly asked for a tip by my masseuse but i chose to respect the owners' wishesOverall: while it could be better, Ziani is a better option than some of the other spa hammams for 200 dirhams. But, improvement needs to be made to match their claims of being great"

While the women enjoyed their experience, the three men in our group had an awful experience. As others have mentioned, the waiting area is nice, clean and relaxing. However, the men's area is worn, dirty and downright scary. We were supposed to have a hamman and a massage. The hamman consisted of a short steam room visit followed by a series of \"treatments\" and seven showers (we spent more time in the shower than we did getting treatments or a massage). As for the massage, it was the absolute worse massage I have ever received. It was more of a light rub than a massage...and it lasted 10 minutes rather than the promised 30 minute massage After we were done, the guy assigned to me put his hand out looking for a tip despite signs throughout the facility saying \"No tipping\". After refusing his gesture, I quickly made my way to the small and dirty changing room. I saw the same guy poking his head in three times looking to see if I was still there so he could hit me up for a tip. It was a very weird experience and I could not waIt to leave. So, while the ladies in our group had a rather nice time, I can't recommend this hamman given what transpired during my recent visit."

They carry two packages: a hammam experience and an extra experience, that basically gives you 30 minutes extra massage or a clay treatment.We choose the extra experience and paid the 350 dirham for it. The hammam provides you with towels, slippers and a wrap around your waist. So you don't have to bring anything yourself.You start with a cup of Moroccan tea in a waiting area. They pick you up and help you undress and do the waistwrap. Guided to the steam area. First a shower. One out of thee showers broken. Doors made out of old windows with plastic. The hammam is rather cold and that takes away part of the comfort.The guy that was appointed to me to do the treatment didn't speak any English so it was hard to communicate.After a few minutes he picked me up in the steam area for a rubbing. Than back into the shower. He started the massage. But it was anyting but that. Not worthy being called a massage. The clay treatment means a few lines of clay on your body, aprox 30 minutes wrapped under a plasic sheet and they poor hot water over you from time to time.Back into the shower to get the clay off, being washed with soap, and shower again. And that was it. And than the begging began: give me money sir. You bring money? You give to me. There are signs all over \"No tipping\" but the staff doesn't care.In the end we got an extra cup of tea. When the owner asked how it was and I responded that is was merely okay, he said \"good\" and walked away. That was it. We both had a simmular experience. So go here for the experience. Not for a good massage nor a proper clay treatment."

My girlfriend really liked hers but for the same treatment, hers was finished 30 minutes before mine and at the end, the lady treating her was very persistent in asking for a tip. When she said she didnt have any money, the lady said \"you must have something\". Now, that's pretty standard in Morocco BUT the hamann has signs everywhere saying \"no tipping allowed\" so we hadnt taken any extra money with us. The while situation made my gf feel quite uncomfortable. I get the feeling the woman was pretty desperate and we didnt want to say anything and get her in trouble."

We decided to take the Package 2, which included the Entry+TopMassage+Seaweedtherapy/Special back +Bathrobe+Toiletbag for 350 dh, altogether 2 hours.Men and women were seperated. There were lockers available in the changing rooms.After undressing, a woman took my hand and ushered me into the steam bath, where 4 other women were already sitting. You couldn't see anything, because the room was full of steam. While I was sitting there, new women were lead in and others were picked up. It seemed to be very busy. I waited approximately for half an hour until a woman, who just spoke french, came to pick me up. She took my hand and brought me into a room where 4 other massagebeds stood. She scubbed me with the the typical Hammam massage glove, washed off the skin with soap and rinsed me with water. It took 5 minutes, if not less. Then I was put back in the steam bath. It was even more crowded now, we had to squeeze together. After another half an hour I was taked out again, now into the massageroom. The massage, which was included contained a 5 minutes \"massage\" where argan oil was just rubbed in a little. Afterwards I was taken back into the steam bath, where they put a seaweedpaste on me and wraped me in a transparentfoil. Now I had to lay on the hard stonebench for approximately 40 minutes! Then someone brought me into the bathingroom again. Put soap on me and rinsed me with water. Then I had to go get changed. Then we could take a tea.Altogether: I spent most of the time waiting in the steambath, everything else was just done really quick. It felt like being on the assembly line! Neither the massage, nor the bath really convinced me.I would not recommend this place!"

Over several visits to Marrakech during the past 5 years I have tried countless locations to find a true Marrakchi experience. Well, this is IT! For the boys, if you like soft towels, a dark room and a pretty girl for your massage, do not come here, you will hate it. (I cannot speak for how the ladies are treated as this is a seperate area at Ziani). However, if you are looking to enter a world with a large dose of the real Hammam culture, are not shy of your body and are OK laying on a marble slab next to a complete stranger enjoying the same experience, then you should come here. You are met by a very pleasant multi lingual guy at reception, which you must pay up front. Don't worry, you will not be disappointed. You are then stripped naked, given a peice of blue cotton to cover your essentials and pulled directly into the steam & massage area. A quick shower, you are then soaped fully (and perhaps intimately for some people) and led into a very authentic domed steam room with only natural light through small glazed holes around the dome. A very pleasant experience.Followed by copious amounts of showers, soapings, scrubbings and a massage of between 30-60 minutes by a mostly naked bloke (except for his own white cotton loin cloth) with hands like shovels - it is just great! For the Rolls Royce version it is a very modest 350Dhs, some 3 times cheaper than any hotel spa, for a standard treatment it's 270Dhs. I left the Ziani feeling squeaky clean, relaxed and ready for the day. I will definitely be returning. Do not get tempted by sellers in the street pulling you elsewhere or taxi drivers who want to take you to the Kasbah for the more 'fashionable bains' - Like Bains de Marrakech or Bains d'Alhambra. You will get a private room for the massage and a pretty girl at these places but you will pay a lot more and you will miss the excellent ambiance and experience of Ziani. See you soon guys!!"

I decided to go for the full massage package (steam room with soaping, scrubbing, 1/2 hour massage + extra 1/2 hour for 70 dirhams more). I was escorted in the massage/shower/steam area by a smiley guy who didn't speak a word of English. He made me shower first (in a really grimy and shabby box) then he took me to the steam room. The room was cold - the steam came on only after 5 good minutes. Just 5 minutes later (not enough to get proper warm) he came to pick me up for the soaping, scrubbing, oiling treatment. These didn't last more than 10 minutes in total. Then he started the massage; Pleasant but nothing more than a gentle stroke who anyone could perform. No longer than 30 minutes (I paid for a full hour massage) and he told me to shower again and go back to the changing room. On my way out he asked me for tip (even though everywhere in the hammam is written NO TIPS! in all languages) which I obviously gave him as after a few hours in Marrakech you understand there is no other choice but to tip everyone if you don't won't to be pestered.The Hammam finishes with a refreshing cup of mint tea in the main lounge. Again, nice but no wows here! Overall just an average experience. Tired facility, pleasant but not professional workers, a bit dirty. Not sure I would recommend it, especially the full hour massage."

Get the scrub and massage package. Lockers, locks, and disposable panties are provided. Only cash is accepted. There's a wash room, steam room, scrub and massage area. Be careful with the marble floor and tables when wet. Take some time afterword to relax in the lounge. If the owner's around, he'll recommend some nearby sites, such as a historical museum a few step away. I'll go back next time I'm in Marrakesh."

My tour leader and my riad desk clerk set me up with the Hamman Ziani. I was used to American massages, but I didn't know what to expect in a Moroccan hammam. It turned out to be a very enjoyable experience, exceeding my expectations. After directing me to a shower and a 5-minute steam room stay, a young man treated me to a very sensual massage. He had me lie down on a table that was covered with an oil cloth and used a liberal amount of body oil on me. Afterward he soaped me up to get as much of the oil off as possible and directed me back to the shower to complete the process. It was one of the best massages I've ever had and made me wish I could have one like it in the U.S. It truly was the icing on the cake. I would go back in a heartbeat if I ever return to Morocco (which is a wonderful country to visit if you've never been there)."

One of our friends had experienced a hammam previously, two of us had not. We were a bit anxious about going, but our previously experienced friend urged us to partake. When in Morocco, do as the Moroccans do! Our tour guide (Khalid) suggested this hammam to us and we were not disappointed. The whole experience was quite unnerving for me initially but once the whole process began I relaxed and enjoyed the experience. I've never felt so clean or pampered, all of the women who take care of us were remarkable...the one who gave me a massage was great! I would definitely do it again...it was very reasonably priced...a similar treatment here in the states would have easily been $200+."

Anyone who is disappointed with this fantastic place should go on to sample either a ridiculously expensive massage in a boutique hotel or the extremely basic facilities in a traditional public hammam. This place strikes a wonderful balance; the building has traditional features but the massage is not the tradiitonal rough manipulation but rather a firm but relaxing massage as good as any I have had anywhere. I went three times during the week, it was so reasonably priced!; all three therapists I encountered were well trained and accomplished. On my final visit I was joined by a friend and his 14 year-old nephew while our two female companions headed into their section. We emerged buffed and glowing and all agreed that we had been treated to a memorably enjoyable experience. Thank you Hammam Ziani!"

I really liked the different small holes with different colors reflecting on you! I meant to give a good tip to the lady when I walked in the front desk to ask to give the tip to the lady, the owner said \"NO TIP\" because they get at least 65% of the fee you paid!

We both decided on the \"standard\" package which was 270DH (~ 33.75USD). A bit high for a hammam but this is a \"Luxury\" place, so hey, why not. Plus, the owner pointed out that they have an explicit no tipping policy as they factor it all in to the price, a policy confirmed by the presence of signs posted almost everywhere in 4 different languages stating \"No Tipping\", a bit odd for Morocco but ok, great!Dropped some things off at the Road and came back for hammam. Upon return, the owner was out but that was fine. I paid for us both, 600DH, got back 50DH and was told they had to go make change and would give me the other 10DH when I got out, no worries. The Hammam itself was amazing, really really great. Awesome steam room, 3 rounds of black soap scrub/exfoliate/massage with cool shower in between. Absolutely incredible for 1.25hrs, I felt great!Upon leaving but before getting dressed, when were both in nothing but barely a half towel, however, my guy stopped me and whispered \"mister, may I have a little tip for me?\" All of a sudden what was an amazing experience got really uncomfortable. I looked at him confused and slowly shook my head and pointed to the signs and said \"I can't, there's signs everywhere.\" He whispered \"yes I know but please just a little.\" And I still shook my head no pointing to the signs. That's a -1 right there. Then he held a finger to his lips and whispered \"ok but shhhh, please not tell I ask for tip\". Super awkward. That's another -1.Got dressed, went out and had some tea while waiting for my wife. Upon leaving I didn't even ask for my remaining 10DH. I feel like the whole situation wouldn't have even happened if the boss was there. A brief chat with my wife afterwards confirmed a similar experience, albeit not so aggressive and secretive.Overall it was an amazing experience that was really soured in the end. I have no problem tipping and its generally the Moroccan way to tip for everything, but this place is very explicit about not doing so, especially since I was asked to keep it quiet that he even asked."

I went to a handful during my time in Morocco and I think this was the best place to start. In my opinion, it was geared toward tourists but at a very reasonable in price. 270 Diram for a steam, massage, and scrub. The whole thing was about 1.5 hours. I love spas, spa treatments, massages, scrubs etc. and like a good deal. This was good and a good deal. You start with a lady who takes you to a locker room. I was wary of leaving my things in the locker, but they gave me the key to carry around with me and I just went with the flow of things. There are lots of detailed reviews about what exactly happens - but essentially a very warm and welcoming lady will take you from station to station, and you will be met by another lady who will tell you to sit, stand, lay down, turn over, etc while they work their magic. While I like the whole thing, the scrub really stands out. I mean they scrub you, every bit of you, and remove the top layer of skin. The scrub was actually more gentle here than at more traditional local hamams and still made me out-of-this world soft and smooth. Pros:1. Warm, welcoming staff. I was as comfortable as possible, being led around to the stations, having buckets of water poured on me, or being told to climb onto a big, slippery massage table in front of several other ladies - and with not much on!2. Great scrub without being too harsh or being to tentative. Perfect for your first hamam experience. Love that squeaky clean feeling.3. Very relaxing lounge, with good attention to detail. Hot tea, lotions, and a hair dryer were available at the end. I have long hair, and really appreciated the hair dryer. 4. Felt pampered - so much that I went back for another round just before we left Marrakesh5. Everybody has the same covering, provided by the hammam. (in more traditional ones you go with your own undergarments, which can be awkward if you are not prepared!)Cons:1. Men have a very different experience - less relaxing, and much more awkward. My BF got hit on (he didn't think it was as funny as I did!) but his massage guy told him he was \"very sexy\" and \"I like you\" over and over. 2. The men's tipping situation is a bit much - on my side, the lady was more discrete. But on the men's side, they sat there with their hand out and asked \"tip...? tip....?!\"If not for the men's section, I would give it 5 stars. Tips:1. I didn't think the additional seaweed wrap did much for me; not worth it. I would rather come back and do the normal package twice for a bit more.2. Make a late evening appointment - less crowded and you will probably be tired from exploring all day. 3. Don't eat just before you go; give yourself at least an hour or so to digest since you will be laying on your stomach, and flipping over several times.4. Be prepared for the lack of covering - on yourself and everybody else5. The front desk guy speaks English, but many of the ladies don't. Just follow them, the answers to whatever questions you have will be obvious soon enough."

Boys were quite stressed by craziness of the square and motorbikes driving through the narrow streets of the souk. Bring on Ziani and his team at Ziani Hamman. Arrived inside to a sweet cup of mint tea! Lush red velvet sofas and fossils in the walls. My wife went off for a quite relaxing hamman. My three boys and I went into the men's Hamman. Great fun as four men guided us through steam room, lit with blue and yellow light beams through the domed roof. Then a body scrub to scrape away the dirt from our journey. Slowly the stress of arrival was massaged away, whilst one of the guys entertained my two year old with water play, and gentle massage. Ending with an almond wash. Inigo chilled out completely and the souk and busy streets no longer worried him. Otto however laughed the whole way through, didn't realise how ticklish he was! Thanks for looking after us, all the best Jonathan (by the way only 270 dirhams each, Ruben was free!)"

They had a lovely waiting room with plenty of moroccan tea to relax you whilst you wait before being taken to the baths. The normal deal is 270 dirhams which pays for scrubbing, a massage, robes, disposable underwear and such. For 350 dirhams you got to be slathered in seaweed mix and wrapped up in plastic (quite unnerving when I first saw someone lying like that - looked a bit like a body bag...) We opted for the more expensive option, how often do you get to do a moroccan hammam?I have to say. They give you sarongs to put on to cover your modesty but this is removed pretty much as soon as you go into the baths so don't get too attached to it. Throughout the experience I may as well have been totally naked which, normally around my best friend and around total strangers I would not be okay with, for some reason in this setting I felt pretty comfortable.The overall experience felt like I was assaulted by large women who I couldn't understand, scrubbed raw, oiled up, slathered in some dark stuff and then wrapped up in plastic to steam. Generally quite confusing but it was great, I felt so relaxed after and my skin was so smooooooth.Definitely not for the faint-hearted but worth a go if you want a good hammam experience!"

Have wanted to have a go at this for a few years now and it was a great experience.Friendly introduction with a tour of the Hammam and free Berber tea prior to us making up our minds. I'm male and the females do have a slightly different experience (so I'm told by the wife!) but just as good.You are allocated a member of staff who makes sure you cover all of the steps so don't worry about not knowing what to do. Hang your modesty up at the door. They do not recommend using bathing trunks as the oils stain these and they provide you with a sarong to cover your bits. You were also allocated a locker for your possessions which was fine. The whole experience lasted just short of 2 hours. Initially you have a shower, followed by a steam (sitting higher gives more heat and they did ask whether I wanted it cool or hot and more steam was added) with an initial soaping, the steam room was an old domed building with covered holes in the ceiling to let light in, seemed quite authentic. I would have preferred longer in the steam room but I guess they need to get people through the lengthy process.I then took a further shower before the \"black soap\" and baby mitt were used to get rid of surface grime and muck. This is like being scrubbed with a light scouring pad! but it does ensure that you are thoroughly clean.Then follows another shower before your top to toe (literally) massage, they don't miss anything. I've had a couple of massages before which haven't done much for me really but this was the first time I've had a male masseur and there is definitely a difference, much better from a personal perspective, really got into the muscles.After the lengthy massage there is a further soaping down with what smelled like almond oils and plenty of foam, prior to a final shower.Like others, although I was told that there was no tipping I was asked, and the chap did stand just outside the changing room whilst I rummaged around trying to find change which was a little awkward.The next day we were walking past the Hammam again, and when we said that we had been in the day before we were offered to go in for free Berber tea again, which I thought was very excellent customer service.Overall a really good experience, and I would use them again, but not perfect."

We'd heard from some who had patronized other hammams that the traditional scrub could be quite vigorous, that the steam could be too warm, etc., so we asked many questions of the owner (excellent English) before we committed. It was a worthwhile two hours of relaxation and a refreshing cultural experience. The Hammam Zania is just off the Place des Ferblantiers, but is not difficult to find from most points in the medina. We would definitely visit again."

The staff are thorough with all the treatments (soap,exfoliation,buffing, washing) and as for the massage...it is 40 minutes or so of utter bliss.

The steam room never quite was hot enough, there were three beds in each massage bay meaning you must negotiate your way around the other clients and masseuses as you take the frequent trips to the showers. On the cool side which isn't great when you're trying to relax and a bit dark & steamy, but not in a comforting way. For most of the time the music wasn't playing so the only sounds were shuffling bodies, scrubbing, muffled Arabic voices and the sounds from the street outside. The scrubbing and massage cover a full 98% of the body, so this is no place to be if you're prudish. On the plus side, the whole place is clean, the showers are past their prime but they work perfectly well and the front of house staff we very welcoming and helpful. There are secure lockers for which you keep the key. In the moments when you feel comfortable enough to relax the scrub and massage are good and \"thorough\", but don't expect a comparable level of relaxation that you might experience from a spa massage. The \"no tips\" policy displayed on numerous signs did not prevent my masseuse from inviting me to compliment on the experience in the corridor and hassling me \"for a small chip\" on the way out, then hanging around the entrance to the changing area whilst I opened my locker for money. Awkward!!"

One of them had found out about this through Trip Advisor and it sounded like what we wanted. We didn't fancy braving the public hammams and even though our hotel had a Clarins Spa in it - we wanted to try something authentic. Make sure you plan your route before leaving your hotel as you will be hassled if it looks like you are lost. We stopped once to consult our map and \"the most trustworthy guy in Marrakech\" told us that it was shut. We decided that we would carry on and another shop keeper directed further down the road to it. It's opposite a car park which is a good marker to keep an eye out for! The owner speaks good English and lets you have a little look around before you make a decision. This was a Christmas treat from one of my friends so I'm not sure on price but we went for the scrub and wrap. They give you a bag which has a sarong and disposable knickers and you can lock your belongings away - some of the lockers have seen better days so we all put our stuff in one locker in the end. You walk through the door and the steam hits you - your sarong is whipped away and you are basically naked so make sure you are with good friends! In the womens' section you are guided about by big motherly-type ladies who direct you about - they are not phased by anything! You get washed, steamed, scrubbed, massaged, wrapped, and washed again. The steam room (and also where you lay in your wrap) is a beautiful domed room. We went on a Monday around 12pm - it wasn't busy but as I was laying in my wrap a group of ladies did have to step around me to sit on the seats - however I think it was more awkward for them clambering over me with disposable knickers on!! The final wash and shampoo could have been a bit longer - however its with Argon oil (I think that's right!) which leaves you feeling super soft for the rest of the day. My hair was silky smooth as well which I didn't expect.Overall this place is a good place for tourists to visit to get a lovely relaxing experience - I would recommend it!"

If it wasn't for him the experience may have been very different. However......Steam room was steamy however felt quite cold, and don't let them take you out from it after only a minute, give yourself a good 8-10 minutes.Showers were in same room as the people getting massaged, quite a distraction.Showers started with a dribble and didn't get much better, didn't even get hotter than luke warm.Woman get beautifully doused in warm water from their masseuse, men just take a shower.If it's busy you could have 3 other people getting massaged in the same room with you. There are two rooms close to each other so total of 8 people. There isn't even enough room to walk around the massage tables like this so it would get quite cosy and I would say, far from relaxing.The room for the massage and scrub is right next to the steam room and as a result these rooms are very humid and steamy too, and just a little cold as well.Oh, and one last thing, changing facilities were a bit uncomfortable. There was an enclave with lockers and a bench. Not so bad, however if you were stood in the wrong place then I'm sure that people at reception would see you. And when I was finished there was a very dodgy guy just sitting at the entrance monitoring things....a little weird and uncomfortable. In total, if you go knowing all this and not expecting more I'm sure you will enjoy, after all the place seemed clean enough and the masseuse seemed to know what they were doing. If you expect better then walk on by....."

This is exactly why we chose it! We wanted the 'public experience' but not the awkwardness of 'are we doing it right?', 'can we sit there?', which can take away from enjoying it and we didn't want to go to a spa, we can do that anywhere. It seemed like it would be the perfect balance and it was.We went mid-morning and there were only a handful of other women, my boyfriend was only with one other man on his side. You get soaped up, rinsed off and sit in the steam room (could have been a little hotter), then scrubbed, massaged (this was really fantastic, she was strong and it was like a deep tissue massage) and I opted for the clay wrap (covered in clay and wrapped in plastic in the steam room for about 20 mins, then shampooed. There were two locals there bathing, the women who worked there were friendly, they even sang a little bit, held my hand everywhere I went so I didn't slip and made it a great experience. My boyfriend had a nice experience too, although he was asked for a tip, even though it clearly says not to give tips. This and the steam room could have been hotter are my only complaints.

After being rinsed down I was left in the steam room to relax, then into another room for the scrub and rinse, the third room for massage, then back to the scrub room to be washed including hairwash. As we entered, another customer leaving, asked me how much I had paid - when I told her we paid the advertised price, she commented that we could have bargained the price down (didn't occur to me as it was a set pricelist, however I was happy with the amount we paid as it was a fraction of the cost of any similar treatment at home).The ladies' side is traditional, with attoendants pouring water over you but my son reported that on the men's side, you just get under a shower - the men's side also has just the two treatment rooms, one for steam and the other for the scrub the massage and the shower. It was a relaxing experience, and we came out feeling squeaky clean.As commented by another reviewer previously, we were also handed baskets with fluffy towels and robes etc as we entered the hammam and these were whisked away quite quickly, not to be seen again. However we were provided with a dry robe and towel at the appropriate time and the attendants have all the products they need on hand. I am not particularly bothered whether the contents of the basket are themselves actually used, but feel it is an unnecessary step to provide customers with a basket if it is only for show. Once you hit the changing rooms you are given some disposable undies, plastic sandals and a cotton wrap that you only wear for the few steps walk into the steam room. You put your clothes in a locker, and the key on elastic band stays on your wrist throughout. The wrap is taken away within 2 minutes of you putting it on, and the rest of the visit takes place wearing the paper pants and the sandals. Be careful as the floors are very slippery, At times you are sloshing through an inch or two of water in the plastic sandals they provide for you to wear, but the attendants keep a firm grip on you as you're escorted from room to room. There are male attendants for men, and women attendants for women. There is a small lounge area to rest after your treatment and mint tea is available there - I noticed a hairdryer and mirror there too in case you don't want to walk back to your Riad with wet hair as we did, but these would have been better placed in the changing rooms.An enjoyable experience."

She was understandably a little apprehensive about the semi-nudity, but this did not last long. The women treating us were so friendly and put her at ease. The hammam was very busy during this visit, so the pace of treatments was a little slower than previous visits, yet we never felt like we were left alone for too long. Nor were we rushed through any treatments. Definitely a fab place to relax and be pampered. Only thing that was lacking this time was mint tea at the end or someone available to ask for some. We just ended up sort of leaving!!! However, looking forward to my next visit in Feb 2014."

It's so good, I've been back.This is more of a authentic hamman compared to the many supposedly luxury spas and hammans in Marrakech.The owner speaks many different languages and is more than happy for you to have a look around without any pressure to purchase treatments.If you're uncomfortable with semi nudity in front of strangers, this isn't the place for you as all treatments take place in communal areas (separate areas for ladies and men)You'll be provided with everything you need, paper pants (I take my own bikini bottoms) sandals, modesty wrap (it's not on for long) towels, bath robes and lockers.Unlike other hammans, you'll be charged a price that includes tips for the staff, so you'll not be pressured into tipping (which can sometimes spoil the experience, especially if you're unsure how much to tip)The staff here couldn't be sweeter. The take great efforts to make sure you're comfortable, and genuinely look after you rather than some of the fake efforts I've experienced In the so called luxury spas as it's aimed at generating tips.Packages include, black soap wash, steam, scrub, massage and mud wraps. The top package includes all of the treatments and takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes all for 3500 dirhams which is exceptional value.You'll be given time to relax after your treatment with some mint tea, hair dyers are available too.You'll leave relaxed and scrubbed within an inch if your life.One of my favourite places in Marrakech, don't miss it.Make sure you take time to pet the owners cute dogs, Linda and Emily. Linda loves the attention."

Before visiting the city, we had decided we wanted to do the Hammam Spa experience, but had read a few reviews of people having poor experiences, for one reason or another. We'd read about Hammam Ziana, and tried finding it, as per the location shown on this Tripadvisor app....NOTE: the location on the app is not correct by a long way! We had to do a google map search in the end.....after a \"friendly local\" who could see we were lost, offered to show us as he was going that way. He didn't, he lead us in a block then asked for money. Lesson learnt! However, once we'd found it, it was so worth the effort. We found it clean, welcoming and no pressure at all to book a treatment. The owner is more than pleased to just show you around and leave you in the relaxation room with a cup of tea. We decided to book the top package, which was 350 Dirhams each. We both found the treatments excellent, relaxing and outstanding value for money. Thank you so much."

            "review": "Great experience but a bit awkward at times. This was a great Hammam and I would go there again. I had the 'super package' for 350MAD . On the super package you get the wash, the steam, the massage and the mudwrap and you definitely come out feeling super clean and chilled. It is incredible good value - under half the price of the spa in my Marrakesh hotel and probably a third of the UK price for the spa equivalent here. That said it is a hammam not a spa, you do need to be comfortable with public near nudity (gender separated but still public). The changing area is private and there is a secure locker to leave your things. You are given a pair of 'micro knickers' to wear, some plastic shoes and a wrap to walk into the hammam itself but once you are in there the wrap is taken away and as both the hammam ladies were busy I was left standing there a while feeling a little self conscious before my lady came to take me for my wash. Once you get started it is better and after the wash you are led to the steam room and left to relax for a while before the scrub. As others have said, the scrub is amazing and scary how much skin comes away! I had the same lady for all my treatments and she was very good, I have a shoulder injury which I explained to her about (in French, I don't think she spoke English, although I didn't try) and she was very careful to make sure that she didn't do anything to hurt it. the massage was excellent and helped ease out my aches and pains from the Camel ride a couple of days earlier, the warp was also good although getting up on to a marble slab covered with plastic when you have just had an oily massage is definitely tricky!I would definitely go back and would recommend Hammam Ziani but there were a couple of things that have stopped me giving this 5 stars. The first is that we popped by the previous day to make sure we knew where it was and decided we might as well book for the next day as we didn't have time to go ahead right then. The man on the desk (not Ziani) asked for a 100MAD deposit which I thought was unjustified as we were booking for a quiet time (early afternoon) and most people just turn up, also we weren't asking them to reserve anything for us - I've never been asked for a deposit for a beauty type service before and I thought it was a bit off.The other disappointment was that I was expecting the full Turkish bath type arrangement, with a series of 3 interconnecting dry hot rooms as well as a steam room, Hammam Ziani doesn't have any dry hot rooms, just the steam room.In summary though, great experience, good value for money compared with the Spa equivalent and a must do, especially if you have been foolish enough to go on a Camel ride :-)"

They turned it on for me but it never got warm enough. For me one of the best bits of a hammam is the buckets of hot water thrown over you to rinse you after washing. At Zaini you go into a shower where the water drips out! it was very disappointing, it was no different to having a normal shower! Suffice to say I wont be going back unless they improve their operation."

The owner is very welcoming and even provides a tour of the hamman, but the best part is he doesn't make you feel obliged to pay for a massage after it. Be aware it is very hard to find!!! Tripadvisor directions are wrong and led us to a different place, which is not even a hammam but a spa. Also as Hammam Ziani don't pay commission to the local Moroccans like other establishments they will be less willing to show you where it is. It is on Rue Riad Zitoun el Jdid and keep walking until you come to a car park. It is directly opposite it with the doorway right on the main road. I had the full package and the extra price was well worth it, getting extra time in the hammam and an hour long massage, absolute bliss. Couldn't recommend it enough!"

However on taking a walk in the Medina, I passed by Hammam Ziani. The owner Ziani was by the doorway welcoming clients and he talked me through the experience. He also gave tips about Morocco on a whole even offering us the local tea even though we were not having a hammam at that precise time. I told him that I would be back and I am so glad that I kept my word, it was a fantastic experience and I have been recommending this place ever since. On entry, you get offered some local tea and then I was taken to the female section of the hammam. I took the super package which included the hammam and mud bath. I was first rubbed down in oil and taken to the steam room, then got scrubbed, massaged and after rubbed with mud and wrapped swaddle- like for some time so that it could all be soaked in. After I was bathed and got my hair shampooed. The staff were wonderful and treated everyone really well. The most amazing part of the experience was the full body massage as my limbs felt like jelly after. I was soooo chilled and relaxed.The overall time was probably an hour and a half and it was so relaxing it seemed longer. I left there feeling as if I were floating and my mind and body were totally relaxed.I will definitely go there again and am not tempted to try anywhere else after this amazing experience. They have repeat customers also as another European tourist told me that this was her third time there. Apparently, everytime she travels to morocco she goes there....and I thought to myself..yep that will be me :-)"

I felt so clean and refreshed afterwards, the perfect antidote to the frenetic bustle and grime of the Marrakech streets. The owner, Ziani was most helpful in explaining the routine and also, afterwards, where we could go to buy products or enjoy great Moroccan cuisine. There was no pressure to buy and tips included in the price, so no pressure there either. We got the 350dh full package and it was worth every cent. The ladies on staff were good at their job and kind. You can tell they really care about giving you a memorable experience and they are not rough. The scrub was good, the massage was exactly the right pressure and the clay wrap was so Devine I nearly fell asleep. I have been to a public Hannam while in Morocco and that is a totally different experience. This is luxury. I also visited hammam Ziani in Casablanca and while it was a great experience too, I liked the Marrakech spa better. Mr Ziani provides attention to detail and service that makes this a must-visit destination when in Marrakech. "

A lot of people on here seemed to be expecting a high end western spa for some unknown reason...The guy on the desk was a little pushy with the packages, we were sure we didn't want the scrub (my girlfriend was worried about the harshness) just the massage etc. We were led to through the various stages, where to undress, where to store our clothes etc.The steam room/sauna was fine, quite warm near the top and not so at the bottom if its not your thing you can sit low. The massage guy was very nice and the massage was nice, not too firm as to be painful. You then get a scrub afterwards which was nice. I'd probably recommend this as being more rewarding after a day of walking around then early like we did it. Still nice though.The massage went for quite a while, definitely more than the 30 mins we paid for. After which I was shown where to get dressed etc. I was NOT asked for a tip or even alluded to one at any stage by any staff member and neither was my girlfriend.Overall I'd recommend it, none of our stuff went missing as I've heard with other hammams, no bill variations and the people were nice. The place is super wet and slippery so make sure you wear the shoes they give you and take your time moving from room to room. I think the place was pretty clean, with all the water/soap/oil/steam you're hard pressed to see more than a few feet in front so people claiming it to be dirty must have better eyes than me.I'd agree if you're not comfortable with nudity/personal space it might not be for you. While during our session you weren't nude at all, just a towel/apron thing they do get quite close to certain areas during the massage which can feel a little weird! (Guys do guys, women do women) so guys, don't think you're getting a girl like Thailand/Bali etc. There was nothing dodgy though, everything above board etc so I had no problem with it and if you read up on Hammams you should already know this, might catch walk-in tourists off guard though.Overall, great way to spend an hour or more, whichever suits!"

            "review": "Two times a charm. My trip to Marrakech was for my honeymoon. I originally planned to come here with my husband as I am an avid fan of hammams, especially if nude, as I have been raised going to Korean bath houses since I was a child. After reading reviews of pretty much being nude and having the best massages, I had to give it a go. The bonus is that Hammam Ziani is very easy to find as it is on the same street as the Palace Bahia, which was a bonus as it was not far from our riad. We first arrived on Saturday 21 Sept before 8pm. It was relatively quiet. We were greet warmly and immeditately given a tour despite saying it's ok we want to go in for sure. They were persistent so we don't get disappointed. My husband LOVED it. He had ZAGHIB (a slim man with glasses) and said despite it being powerful, he felt so relaxed and as if all his muscles and joints from our first two days of intense trips were all set in the right place again. Apparently, the men's section was virtually empty. I was led to the female room and it was pretty busy. If I recall they have 5 or 6 massage tables and three tables for scrubbing and bathing. I was bathed quickly and led to the hammam where one woman was. At first it was wonderful until nearly 25min later I am still there in the cold, with no steam, and clearly forgotten. Later I am fetched and scrubbed, but it was so gentle and with the steam long gone, my skin was not easily shedding. Next was the massage, which was very disappointing. Everything was on a set time and there was no focus on my aching feet or back. The back massage was painful and just that. After it finished, I was in more pain than when I came in. At the end, I was so disappointed and terrfied my husband had the same experience. I was wrong, thank goodness!What made it better is the willingness of the manager to get me to come back as my husband wanted to. I said I would go elsewhere while he went to Ziani. Instead, I was convinced to come back as I was told that I would be given a 30min massage for free. We missed our appointment on the following Monday due to a terrible day trip, but they easily re-scheduled us for our last day before our flight. I was given a great price to make up for the disappointment and my husband again was happy. He opted both times for the 350 Dirhams package. Our second time he has HASSAN. He said he was not powerful like Zaghib but was so detailed. He spent time on each aching point that my husband again was in heaven. What was consistent is the fact that both of his guys were very attentive and knew exactly where to massage more. It was busy again on the women's side, but this time it was better! ADIJA (sp?) is a young, round woman who bathed me properly making sure I was clean and lathered up before leading me to the hammam. I was given time in the hammam in the glorious steam. Adija came to get me and when she scrubbed. WOW! It was a massage and scrub in one. I would say she would be the female version of Zaghib with power. Literally my back that was hurting cracked when she scrubbed me and I felt so relieved! Plus the fact I was there for a second time and a lot of skin was scrubbed off means my first time was a waste. Afterwards, I was escorted by FATIMA, an older lady, who is supposed to be one of the best. She is the female version of Hassan. My hour massage with her was very relaxing. Maybe I could have done with more power, but with the amount of stress I face, I'd be in pain from all the reflexology. Instead, Fatima was so attentive and got so deep in my tissues that I felt relaxed. I wasn't cracked into place but I was massaged enough to feel relaxed, which is a difficult thing to do. Overall, I'd go to Ziani again. On our last day, we met Ziani. He lived in San Francisco for some time. I am from LA so that was a conversation starter. The best part though is when I told him of the night before and how I bonded with two of his dogs. When I mentioned them by name, his smile lit up and he asked me if I'd like to see puppies! YES! He truly loves his dogs. We were led to the back where I was immediately tackled by his friendly dogs and the cutest puppies ever. Marrakech is beautiful but I think Ziani's dogs made my trip because the puppies were too cute. My husband, who has allergies, even admitted that the puppies warmed his heart. Wonderful service from management. If you choose to go, for women request Fatima (if your muscles need relaxing) or Adija (if you really want to be cracked into place). For men, request Zaghib (like Adija) or Hassan (like Fatima).In all honesty for 350 Dirhams (\u00a326) is a wonderful price. You are given a bathrobe and necessary items. Also it comes with hammam, scrubbing, 30min massage, 30min seasweed wrap, and washing. Instead of the seaweed wrap you can opt to extend your massage to a full hour."

Blokes strip off completely, apart from a little wrap around skirt thing, so be warned - you should not be squeamish about being near-on naked. First of all, one of the attendants washes you down with some black soap, and then you go into the sauna for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, you are taken to have a quick shower, and then the treatment begins! You lie down on a table where you are scrubbed to within an inch of your life (gommage), with barely a square inch being left unscrubbed (again, having any hang-ups about getting up close and personal will seriously interfere with the experience!). After a complete layer of skin has been shred, another shower follows, followed by a massage. The package costs 270 dh (about \u00a330), and ends with a glass of mint tea in a peaceful sitting area, which is good as I could hardly stand afterwards, and slept for 3 hrs when I got back to my hotel! I would definitely go back again if I visited Marrekech"

I didn't like that the massage guys were all talking and shouting with each other while people were getting massages. No quiet peaceful music, just a lot of talking. Kind of annoying. When you walk to/from the showers, you literally have to bump into someone's feet getting massaged. Not spacious at all.

Ziani very welcoming and homely, guided us into his darkened fragrant abode with promises of mint tea which he did deliver. We were made to feel very relaxed, no pressure at all, we just soaked up the wonderful sensory pleasure of the lounge area and given our slippers, towels and robes and locker keys. Ziani's dogs are sweet and I am not a dog person but they took to me instantly. We settled on the full package costing 350 dirhams. His staff do not speak English and my French was gcse level 30 odd years ago! But we managed as best as we could. There was not one inch of me that was not scrubbed, I laid back and just thought of England. After a while you do relax and just slip into the warm velvety folds of bliss. I think I actually may have regressed to my childhood as the ladies do everything for you, they even guide you onto the rooms to stop you shooting out of the door from all the oil and mud on you. All my british prudishness went out the window and you find yourself in a state of euphoria as all control is taken away from you, just enjoy the moment. The massage with argan oil was incredible, I did think they may have been pressing too hard at one point as I could hear things cracking, however pain I had been suffering in my back and neck was relieved immediately.the massage they do seems to be a mixture of shiatsu, reflexology and general massage, the smells are wonderful. Be prepared to be massaged front and back, you can cover some modesty with a pair of paper knickers, little did I care, I enjoyed the whole experience especially the hair washing, head massage and being scrubbed with almond soap. We relaxed after this awesome session with more mint tea and chatting to the owner.he does not encourage tipping...but do what your heart tells you if you feel it is right. These women have magic fingers and can caress your cares away. I would go back again, there are probably more spa like ones, but for those on a budget price was pretty good and ziani makes that experience even more special with his warm welcome. This hammam comes highly recommended!"

I was directed by my tour guide to this hamam and was a bit sceptical but once our group was inside the perception changed. we were taken to a lounge with big comfortable sofas and offered Moroccan tea and cold water as it was 45-50c outside. we were well looked after and didn't have to take anything with us, not even a towel and soap. the sauna and massages were very good as we had the superior package and included everything in the hamams offering. After our session the ladies were not 100% happy with the massage so the owner offered a free same session the next day.The next day we also took the kids(8 of them) and they all enjoyed it also. the owner of the business was very welcoming and entertained the kids while we were waiting for the ladies which took them nearly a hour longer than us.All in all a good experience and worth the money."

We (me and two other men - they have a separate women's section) took the 270 Dirham package (about \u00a322) for which you get soaped and sit in the steam room for about 10 mins; then scrubbed down hard followed by a nice long massage and a wash down. in between each stage, you need to shower in a cubicle. If you have never been to one before, a visit to a hammam in marrakech is a must. The massage we got was very good but: (a) the boys doing it asked for a tip even though there are notices against tipping - they are mostly young students; (b) the place is not the cleanest and showers not the best; (c) they loofah they used for the scrub came out of a new sealed pack but I do wish they used several of them - one second he was scrubbing my heels and toes and the next he was on my face and shoulder with the same loofah - and the loofah does touch your nether areas as well. Ziani, the owner, is a good salesman and you can negotiate if you a group. Also, two of his dogs keep you entertained (although, not in the massage, shower area!). Do go to this place if you are on a budget as there aren't many that give you this quality of massage. But if you are looking for a calm, serene surrounding with nice clean, white interiors and marble all around - this is definitely not the place. The soap they use has an earthy smell that is not to everyone's taste (after smelling me when I came out, my wife changed her mind of trying it!). Most other places that are cleaner, better would cost 400+ DHS. Be prepared to get butt naked - I saw some men wearing their pants (that's underwear in British English!) but we chose not to and it was fine..."

There are separate section for men and Women. The hammam takes around 90 minutes. They provide you with towels and robes with some moisturizers for after the hammam. They ladies are very polite and friendly, since this was my first experience I was feeling a bit weird but she made me feel very comfortable and at ease. They start off with the cleansing process and use some kind of mud paste to scrub your body. Once done they take you to the steam room, then they give you a nice and very relaxing hot oil body massage (which I wished lasted forever!) and then there is shampoo it get rid of all the oil. The experience was worth the price. After the Hammam you are served hot lemon and mint tea to complete the relaxing process .

We had the cheaper package which was about 270 dirham and included hammam, scrub, massage. I felt utterly wonderful and like jelly afterwards which was such a nice change as we'd spent days wondering around the busy and sometimes a little bit hectic souks. The women who did me and my friend didn't speak any English but this wasn't a problem at all, as they know the basics ('turn over') so if you essentially let them turn and flip you around then language thing isn't a problem. I would describe this place as rustic. If you're looking for 5 star tourist luxury this isn't it, but you can get those in London, you come here for something that feels a bit more authentic and is pretty good value too. On a slightly odd note - their mint tea was the nicest I tasted in Marrakech! I haven't had this style of treatment before, so the fairly sudden change from fully clothed to being almost completely naked, wandering between rooms and being rubbed from toes to earlobes was a bit of a shock to me at first, hence be prepared to be naked, but also be prepared to have a lovely relaxing time."

I'd suggest go early in the day, we were the first in there and so it was just us in both the male and female areas for a long time. It isn't for the body shy. I was in just some small paper knickers and my husband in a little towel. You keep slipping the shoes they give you on and off. You need them as it can get very slippy. I had an amazing soaping, steam, scrub, massage, mud pack and then wash off. The amount of dead skin that came off was amazing. Afterwards we both felt amazing and would love to return.

My friend and I flew home this Thursday, 23rd May, having decided that a pre-flight visit to a hammam would be a jolly way to wind up our wonderful holiday. We settled for Hammam Ziani and were not disappointed. We did not want the usual spa experience with its inflated prices and sometimes snooty therapists and this traditional hammam was a world away from that. We rather tentatively stepped into the small entrance where we were immediately made to feel welcome by the manager - there was no hard sell, just an explanation of what treatments were available. We discussed them with him over a glass of mint tea and settled for the very reasonably priced two hour deluxe package. We were then collected by our respective therapists, charming and caring women who took us to change and showed us where we could lock away our belongings. We were then given some outrageously small g-strings to wear, much to our amusement. There followed two hours of steaming, scrubbing, massaging with oils and hair washing before we were wrapped in towelling robes and given a towel to dry our hair. This was followed by relaxation in the traditional sitting room, where we sipped our mint tea before leaving with a spring in our step and a great sense of wellbeing.A word or two of caution:1. Although there is a 'no tipping' sign up, a woman who appeared to be in charge came and asked for a tip at the end of the session 'for the girls.' I had no objection to tipping my therapist - she worked incredibly hard on my behalf, but I was concerned that she may not have got a share of the money I handed over.2. Beware of the wet and slippery marble floors. Never move away from the massage tables without immediately putting your hammam shoes back on - these are provided."

First, it was about twenty minutes short of the length that we were told it was going to be; the masseuse skipped his back almost completely. Futhermore, although there are signs everywhere saying that tipping is not permitted, the man who attended him in the hammam demanded a tip at the end. He gave him all the change he had (about 10% of the total, still a reasonable amount, and he wasn't going to give him one hundred dirham), but the attendant insisted it wasn't enough and asked for more. However, when my fiance mentioned the problems to the owner, the owner was very apologetic. He asked my fiance to point out the attendant, then offered a free hour massage or a significant portion of the price back. The service wasn't flawless, but as a business they handled it about as well as you can if your employee acts inappropriately."

The treatment itself is as has been described on TA. Every bit of it was wonderful and eased our aching muscles as we had been in the mountains for a few days. We all left feeling refreshed (& exhausted at the same time). The women who did the treatments were fantastic. They guided us carefully through all the different treatments / rooms, etc. Due to the nature of a hammam every surface is wet & slippy. One major advantage of Ziani is that all the treatments are on one level.(at least they are in the female side - do not know about the male side?) In other spas I have been to in Morocco, treatment rooms have been on many levels, making the dangerous slippy floors, even more so. The owner and staff are all very welcoming & made us feel very pampered in Marrakech. Will definitely go again when next in Marrakech."

There are lots of \"guides\" trying to drag you into every Hammam to get their cut so beware of where you are dragged. One of the great things about this place is the owner who gave us great restaurant recommendations and a list of things to do in Casablanca which was our next stop. The second best was that everything was provided and our cloths and possessions were locked up and reasonably safe. The \"sell\" was very friendly... We were allowed to leave and have lunch before coming back for our treatment. The experience was unique. A mix of steam, scrub, massage, mud pack, and stretching for 350 durams for the deluxe package for 2 hours. A woman on out tour went to a fancy hotel for 1200 durams for 1 hour. This is a lot more authentic.  There was a big sign in the men's area that said tipping is not allowed and i was told that the house splits the take with the workers. MY massage person asked for a tip which was awkward although everyone in Morocco will ask for a tip."

Treatments were very good, very thorough (very different experience to an English spa!) - don't expect to cover up! Brilliant massage. We sat down afterwards and were given mint tea and pastries - really great service. We paid 270 dirhams (about \u00a322 at our exchange rate) - more than you would pay in a 'local' hammam, but having spoken to others who went to their corner hammam (where you need to bring own shampoo, bath mat, sponges, buckets etc) our experience sounded so much better, and it was a beautiful setting.

We were told that if we wish we can have 1hour message instead of the mud mask; this appealed to us. However the guy who did the deal with us did not tell his staff in the Hammam the change in the program, so we still had to have the 30 min message and the mud mask. It was pointed out by another reviewer that they use the same Lipha/ kiess for scrub from one person to another. And I agree that is the case, I wish I had purchased one from the market they are less than \u00a31 each and taken it with me. Also they don't have good hair shampoo and conditioner etc so take these with you. I was also not that keen on the towel and the bath gown I was given, for some reason I did not feel it was all that clean ( only my feeling mind) so my advise take these things with you and get a price reduction for them. If you negotiated any deal make sure the person who made the. Deal with you pass that information to the staff concerned.Over all it really was not that bad, and I have not caught any thing nasty, so don't be too alarmed, but it is good to know what you are getting and to be happy with it from the start.I have been to Hammam in Kuala Lumpur ( Moroccan Hammam! In KL) and that was far superia and better value than this Hammam in Marakech, the same in Turkey; all in all this was a slight disappointment for me. I will try some where else next time."

And this cost about $35 U.S.! They use soap and shampoo containing argan oil, which is great. I agree that the concrete slabs in the steam room and massage room could use a bit of padding, but that couldn't take away from the experience. Highly recommended! One caveat...look up the address ahead of time and have a cab take you there. The medina is VERY difficult to navigate on your own."

The owner is an extremely nice guy that has given us somerestaurants and places to go that were just outstanding. He was almost our personal tour guide. The hammam itself is beautifully decorated. However the steam room and massage rooms could use some work.In general; a very nice and worthwhile place to visit for any tourist thay wants a hammam experience."

I enjoyed this experience the most. Yes it might seem to be a bit dated but they are reasonably priced. Men cater for men and woman for woman. The men that did my message and gommage was really good. I would go there every day if I could. You are first taken in for a shower then you are asked to sit in the dome steam room. No one else really bother you in the steam room and there are buckets of water if you want to cool down-I guess its help yourself, I didn't use it. You are then asked to go through to another room within the hammam to get a gommage (Scrub), after the gommage you are directed to the showers again where after its a message on the same bed you were scrubbed. Finally you are soaped down and asked to take one last shower."

Hmmm..I got to be honest having read the reviews myself before going to Ziani I was expecting better\u2026It wasn\u2019t terrible, but it just wasn\u2019t what I was expecting I guess. In brief, my boyfriend went one way I went the other (separate sex hammam) I joined a group of 6 French women. There were only 3 women working so there was A LOT of time waiting in the steam room with absolutely no explanation as to what to expect next which was a little unnerving. The \u2018wash\u2019 took literally seconds then you\u2019re back in the steam room. Then someone comes in, takes you by the hand and lies you on a concrete slab for a scub with the same mit that has just been used on the other ladies\u2026. It\u2019s vigorous, as expected it an exfoliating rub down, but I was just so uncomfortable on a rock hard table.Then.. back in the steam room. Meanwhile, I may add that there is constant shouting and chatting between the workers which again wasn\u2019t what I imagined, as I thought it was supposed to be a relaxing experience \u2013 far from it. The best bit \u2013 the oil massage, more of a rub than a muscular massage but it was nice. As you are not told what you\u2019re doing next I was standing around butt naked waiting to be told where to go next... The steam room. So I decided to take a shower and wash out the oil from my hair, although the showers don\u2019t work so I had to wash my hair using a bucket. The towels and robes are old, like really old so I personally didn\u2019t feel the place as particularly clean. My boyfriend had a different ordeal, it sounded better than what I had, but equally said It was something he\u2019d choose not to do again. However, having said that we have spoken to people who have enjoyed a hammam in various places around Marrakech, so I\u2019m sure it can be a very enjoyable experience, but I won\u2019t be going back to Ziani again.However, I could have visited on a day where they were short staffed, therefore it would explain the long periods of waiting round and having a rushed wash, scrub and massage, but personally I wasn\u2019t impressed with the service."

In any event I thought it was a perfect compromise \u2013 fantastic black soap up, followed by steaming in the steam room, then an amazing oil massage \u2013 not too hard, not too soft - loofah down, wash down (the soap smelled like Perkins Paste! please take this as a positive comment, it smelled lovely), a couple of showers; all in a friendly, clean establishment. The masseur did ask me to go and get him a tip and give it to him in the massage room \u2013 he must have had to share if it was handed over in other parts of the establishment or something along those lines; but I was happy to tip him and I did as asked. I gave him 50 Dirhams (~5 Euros) and he seemed happy. I had the seaweed wrap add on and all up it cost D350 (or around 35 Euros). If I get back to Marrakesh I will head straight to Ziani on day 1 \u2013 unwind quickly into the holiday - I will skip the seaweed (save D100) but I will make sure I get back for a second visit on my last day."

I really dont think I have laughed so much for a long time. We were basically scrubbed and massaged for hours by women who didnt speak a word ofEnglish but made us feel very welcome. It is not for the faint hearted though; we stripped off and wore a skimpy pair of paper pants whilst the women who worked there rubbed us in soap, scrubbed us, washed our hair and threw buckets of water all over us. Because we were laughing, they tickled our feet to make us laugh even more. My friend who had just been massaged with argan oil was slipping all over the marble table whilst I was having my hair washed and buckets of water thrown over me. A very relaxing but fun afternoon. However, we did look a state walking back to our riad as we didnt prepare and take conditioner for our hair!!Highly recommended."

I agree with most of the reviews here that it is quite an authentic experience - although a bit on the more expensive side - but much cheaper than if you were to go to the Hilton.They offer several packages but it is structured such that you have not much choice but to choose the basic package at 270 Dirhams. This gives you a steam bath, a scrub, a massage and a cup of that obligatory mint tea afterwards. There is a locker for you to keep all your valuables - but i would not suggest that you bring too much precious stuff with you as the locker does not look too strong for the determined thief.For those who find the steam bath too cold, just inform the attendant who will turn up the heat. Trust me, it does get extremely hot once they turn it on. As for the scrub, for those not used to it, it is strange but you will be surprised at how much dirt they can get off you.The massage is more like \"Thai\" massage than aromatherapy massage so be prepared to be pressed and turned, rather than \"stroked\".The whole experience lasted about one and a half hours to 2 hrs. As usual, you are expected to tip.I only give 4 stars instead of 5 for these reasons:1. Price is way too expensive in Marrakesh. The local hammam is only about 10-20% of the price.2. Locker is not strong enough3. Pressured to give a tip at the end of service."

They give you a basket with all the neccessary lotions etc and you change into a wrap which stays on throughout (men). Your attendant then takes you to the steam room where you wash with black olive soap and then are taken to a table for the gommage. Rough gloves and more soap get you really clean. After a shower you have a massage. Very good full body massage then another shower and out to get dressed. The whole experience lasted about one and a half hours. You are expected to tip the guy who performs the treatment. Give whatever you think appropriate. When you are dressed you are served mint tea in a small lounge. All in all a very satisfying experience."

Whilst others may prefer the posh spa surroundings of other Moroccan hamans for my mind this is much better - a perfect balance between traditional and touristy.Agree with many of the previous statements - nice and clean, and very welcoming. We had a tour first and then went back later in the day to have our treatment.Once you get used to the paper knickers and trying not to be self conscious - a bitish thing I think !!! - then it was fantastic - the scrubbing in particular was very good as was the massage. Partner also enjoyed his and we met up after for mint tea in the relaxing area. Right near the palace so easyish to find (well as easy as anything is in Marrakech!!!)As previous people have said a tip is expected although I didnt feel pressured - tipped about \u00a32.50 which I dont think was bad at all.If I got back whic I hope to do would def go back to Hamman Ziani"

I can't begin to describe how wonderful an experience I had at the Hamman Ziani in Marakech.The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming to my friend and I. We visited first and were shown around the spa so we could see how it all worked and what would happen and then the various packages were explained to us. We bought the deluxe package for 350 dirhams (about \u00a344), which meant we didn't have to book in, just turn up when we wanted and included the steam, gommage (the scrubbing), 30 min full body massage with scented argon oil, 30 min seaweed wrap and almond full body and hair wash.It was a luxuriant experience, though the girls who provided our treatments spoke limited English and us limited French we were able to communicate and have a nice conversation. The architecture of the hamman itself was beautiful, with lots of white tiles, arched ceilings and grey and white marble tables and sinks that were intricately carved.A pair of bikini knickers (brand new), a key locker, slip on flip flops and a terry cloth robe were provided as part of the package and at no time did you feel hurried. I have very long hair and one of the ladies also took the time to brush it for me after the session had ended, which was an additional luxury that I enjoyed.Tipping is expected and other reviewers have complained about this. However, tipping in Morroco is an expected part of the culture, but you shouldn't be expected to tip until you are dressed and able to access your locker. We gave a 50 dirham tip (about \u00a36) between the two of us as we had two ladies working on us constantly for 1.5 hrs and an attendant who helped us in the changing rooms.After the session we spent 15 minutes in the chill out room and had a complementary mint tea (the morrocan drink of choice) and listened to some lovely ambient music.All the products used on us were available to buy in their boutique, but it must be noted that prices here are much higher than the pharmacies in the Kasbah and Souk, but we were not pressured to buy anything, which was nice.I would be very tempted to go back to Marrakech for a weekend just to experience this Hamman again. It was a great experience and a wonderful way for my friend and I to round off our holiday in Marrakech on our last day."

They have a lovely area to relax and have some tea in after the whole experience.Oh also the entrance price is negotiable. We managed to get it nearly at half price for the 3 of us.

If you haven't had an authentic hammam, you may be impressed by the beautifully decorated, expensive production-line set-ups around Marrakech. If you want \"the job done\" this is the place.Once we found the hammam in a lane ( near a historic palace) we were shown a menu of treatments. We chose the hamman option with an argan oil body massage.We were prepared with our \"swim wear\" with us- you will be only wearing the bottom half. We were led to the ladies section, given a set of towelling robes, slippers and a locker with a key. Then we entered a dome shaped traditional steam room.The room was steamy and since we picked 2pm (early by local standards) we had the place to ourselves. It was a great experience, especially the way the shafts of light streaked through the steam ( the dome shaped room had small holes in it, and the sunlight pierced through- we were in another era. The scrub was great, the massage was amazing, they even washed my hair for me afterwards, i've never had such a good head massage. The staff we very welcoming and friendly. Tipping is standard in Marrakech, we were not pressured. In fact after the treatment, we went looking for the ladies to give them a token of appreciation. Its clean, prices are good ( we paid 270 Dh for our treatment), we emailed in advance, but they replied and stated we could walk in anytime, as is the custom in a Morrocan Hammam. Afterwards we sat and had a refreshing mint tea in the salon. I like the authenticity, although it isn't one of the \"public\" hammams where one would take their own soap, towel, bucket etc. its adequate for me. I shall be returning and have recommended Hammam Ziani to everyone i've met. ( i've had about 8 hammam treatments in the past)They speak enough English to communicate, the prices are fair, the treatments are thorough, and they do a good job. thanks to trip advisor, it was because of a previous review that i chose to visit."

Anyway, scrubbing felt like a massage, the hot room was good and clean, there were enough assistants there to guide and treat us, there was a decent changing room and a nice relaxing (tea) room for after-bath. There are probably many more luxurious hammams around, but this was a very good introduction to all of us. Everybody felt very happy, and ready for a good dinner, afterwards. This contrasted greatly with the experience we had in a terrible \"hammam\" a few days later in Essaouira (for a higher price)."

I researched thoroughly before embarking on the hammam experince, so that I would be prepared for what was to come, having never even been to a spa before. I was not let down by my experience at Ziani. The guy on the reception talks you through the options ( I went for the full package) and although the women inside don't speak much English or French, they are pretty patient and point you where you need to go, so it's best to just go with it. You get handed a basket with a robe etc in it, get changed into your paper knickers and make your way to the first area where you hang up your robe. The staff can tell what package you're on by the colour of your flip flops and the basket you're given to take with you (not sure why, maybe in case you want to use your own shampoo etc). Oh and yes, I would slip some money for tips into the pocket of your robe when you're getting changed so that you have that with you at the end. You then go and sit in the steam room for a while till a lady summons you to be soaped down and splashed clean, Then you sit some more, till another lady comes in and you are massaged, scrubbed and slathered in mud and plastic sheeting to within an inch of your life! The whole experience is quite odd but the women are friendly and have seen it all before. At the end you can shower and wash your hair (although I'm not sure if there's a hairdryer) and get helped back into your robe. Generally, the lady that massages you is the one who gets tipped and she'll be with you for most of the process. The place does smell a bit odd, but not dirty, just don't expect the kind of shiny clinical feel of a comparable Western institution. I enjoyed it and was clean and soft at the end of it all, glad I did it."

It is quite hilarious indeed. Under which body part can you hide the money when doing hammam?Actually, my wife and I have no objection to tip, providing that (i) circumstances allow (ii) this is discretionary. Unfortunately, both were negative in this incident. (i) Apart from the fact that there is nowhere to hide any money during hamman, my wife has actually given all her belongings to me when she was enjoying the pampering due to security concerns.(ii) After knowing that my wife has no money on her, the staff immediately showed an unfriendly face and attitude towards her. She was detained in the property until I arrived and gave her money to set her free.This is simply horrible. My wife almost burst into tears when she saw me. So, ladies, make sure you bring enough money with you to tip, apart from the fact that the service has already been paid for upfront."

I was left in the steam room for a long time and then given a quick massage and scrub.The scrub was great, but for that price, I would have liked to be treated less as a problem and more as a valued customer.Worse, 2 young women tourists decided to walk in with 4 wailing children. An experience that should have been relaxing, ended up being just the opposite!!Anyway, I had a few hours to kill on my last day in Marrakech and decided to try a Hammam again. The Ziani was the most conveniently located- so I went back- but with extreme misgivings. I told the owner about my awful experience the last time and he assured me that this time would be different. He instructed one of the attendants to look after me- and gosh, did she! I was given fantastic treatment, a lovely scrub and massage and a great sauna soak.In the end, I came away with good feelings about Ziani- but if you want to be treated well there- you will need to be a bit assertive.Otherwise, thanks to some good reviews here, they get a lot of tourist traffic and may be slacking just a bit.Go there for the convenient location, good facilities and treatment that can be very good- if you push for it.."

Having read previous reviews off the internet, i reckoned that this place was just about right- and it was , for what I wanted. I took th 280 dirhams menu- and it was everything i wanted. When you go in they allocate someone to you who looks after you for the duration of your stay. My man was 'abdullah'. First he shows you to the changing room where you swap your clothes for a sarong like wrap. Clothes are put into a locker and you keep the key. First a shower and a soap rub, then on into a very steamy steam room for about 15 minutes. on emerging from the dteam room another quick shower and then onto a 'table'. There were four tables in the room and other people were being treated at the same time, but by different attendants. I have been to a hammam in Turkey once. There the job was done on the floor of the large baths area, this place is a bit more upmarket than that. No sloshing of water buckets - however much fun that is. The room is tiled and there is a coloured glass window. First round is a good scrub with a sort of loofah mitt. All over, but carefully just avoiding the most intimate parts. Abdullah showed me just how much skin came off me. A lot! Then a shower , and on to the massage. It was quite strong. With oils rubbed in to all over. A few stretches and pressure applications nearly made my eyes water!! Then some warm soap and a hair and body wash, and another shower to get it all cleaned off. You come out feeling so fresh and clean. All the spare skin is sloughed off, and knots and hairs straightened. Really an exceptional experience. Reborn is what people say. However I recognise its not for everyone. My wife didn't fancy it, nor the other couple we travelled with. Its not for someone with (say) a bad back unless the masseur is extra careful - or people who are overly embarrassed about another person being that personal about cleaning them almost all over. However, cosidering the whole experience, I enjoyed it and look forward to going again to a hammam sometime.Just to mention, it took me ages to find the place, maps of marrakesh are not good. However , in fact it is only about five minutes off the main square. Just a few doors along, there is a shop selling soaps, oils and ungents. Run by a man called Zac. Its a good place to buy things to take home to use as next best thing to having this kind of scrub at a hammam. Ask the man on the ticket desk where Zac' s place is!"

Having gone to the Medina Spa, I was 100% satisfied I made the right choice. Medina Spa is run by very friendly staff who know their stuff.My group of three tried to book the \"Rituel Marocain\" for 150dh but were told this was only available in the morning. Instead we went for the massage duo with an extra person. It meant we payed 280dh each instead. It was worth every extra dirham though.First we received our treatments in the steam room. I'm normally fine with heat but even I found the heat a bit much after a while. A glass of water and some fresh air and I was good to keep going. Upstairs we had our massages, which were top quality, and then finished it off with some lovely tea in our bath robes.This is probably the one attraction above all I'd recommend visiting in Marrakech."

It was our first Moroccan scrub so we didn't know what to expect. The sauna was not clean and the scrub part was sloppy (under 2 minutes), leaving half of our skin unscrubbed. The mud application was watered down and again, applied very sloppy and only to part of our skin. Each were washed off by someone throwing buckets of water on us (which was almost comical.) So then the massage...We proceed upstairs with our two massage therapists and had high hopes. This was worse than the scrub- the girls did not stop talking (in French)! The massage was more of a rub for me and my husband said his was not even that. They eventually stopped massaging and just sat there! We tried to tell the receptionist on the way out and the discomfort even got worse (our riad called later). We were so sorry that we didn't go to one of the two top rated spas on Trip Advisor. Pay more and go elsewhere!"

That said, we were greeted by staff with excellent English, did not need anything other than either a bikini for women or swim trunks for men. Bathrobes, towels, slippers were all provided, and they were clean and comfortable. If you forget your bathing suit, you can just wear your underwear and bring a dry pair to change into afterwards. The scrubbing women invited my niece and me to take off our tops, which we did. (Although we had asked if they could take all three of us at the same time, we did not realize my niece's boyfriend would be shown into the same room. With all the water, he had to keep his eyes closed most of the time anyway, and why look at me --62 -- when my niece -- 24--, his girlfriend, was there.) We chose to just have the gommage -- the traditional exfoliating scrub with a variety of soaps. Massages are available as well as other services, but we wanted something uniquely Moroccan. The whole experience was just scrumptious. It's been about ten days since, and my feet are still totally smooth. After we dressed -- woozily -- they served an herbal tea, which was delightful. The place isn't terribly easy to find, but it's also not that hard. From Jemaa head up towards the Cafe de France and continue past it up that long arm of the Jemaa. Take the next major right turn, Rue des Banques. There's a right turn about 20 feet before the street ends at the point where Rue (or Derb) Kennaria becomes Rue (or Derb) Riad Zitoun el Jdid. There was no name on this little street, but it's Derb Zaari. On the righthand side near the end of it, you will find Medina Spa. There could be a wait if you just show up. We booked ahead by asking our hotelier to call them, and went right in. None of us can remember what we paid anymore, although we think it was either 150 or 200 dh, which is $15-20. We were there for about an hour."

I saw two dime sized spots of mold on the pads and we were given wet, squelchy shoes to wear. It looked like they just rinsed off the pads with no real disinfecting. Also, the hammam portion didn't involve a soak in warm water so keep that in mind. After the hammam, we were wrapped in our robes and taken upstairs in our now REALLY wet shoes to the massage room. The man at the front desk wondered why my husband didn't have a towel for his hair and promised to bring one to him but never did. The massage itself was relaxing although the room was a bit noisy as you could hear some street sounds from outside. We also were given the massage in our wet disposable underwear, which was uncomfortable. After our nice warm massage we were wrapped in our wet, COLD robes, given back our squelchy shoes (now slippery with massage oil) and sat down outside with a thin blanket and barely warm tea. I chugged mine and ran downstairs to get dressed and warm. Overall, it was a nice experience but the cold, wet robes, and nasty shoes really made my rating go down. So much could have been improved if they charged a little more and made sure after your hammam you were kept warm and dry. I will not return to this place."

Anyways went to the hammam the girl ran in front of us and washed the place in 2 secs and said ok ready! one poor girl was working on both of us, didn't speak good English, kept leaving during the process...one time she was gone for over 15 mins that I had to leave and ask what are we supposed to do? The answer was oh just wait she will be back! She actually didn't do a bad job at all otherwise...then we were guided to go upstairs, through the cold lobby again and walk by the main entrance, again very unprofessional....worst massages we have ever had in our lives. It was more like rubbing some kind of not so good smelling oil on our bodies!We get massages on regular massages so maybe we are spoiled and expected more but this was not a massage. They were talking to each other during the massage, not relaxing, one of them left half way somewhere and came back and did some weird massage movements that has no medical explanation...I'm in the medial field and i know what needs to be done! Then at the end we were laying on the table for 5 mins with nothing getting done, I raised my head up to find both of them sitting down. I asked if we were done? She said just lay down and relax, running the clock... oh well the massage is supposed to be for an hour but you are sitting down...we both said we are really good and decided to leave.Save your money and pay a little more and get something really worth it. We did one that was double the price and actually loved it and regret not going back to the first place.

The hammam (black soap and scrub) was very good as was the 30 minute massage afterwards. The spa is very good value for money and the staff were friendly. We enjoyed the experience and would return.One important piece of advice: we were trying to find the spa and were accosted by a man who pretended to work for Medina Spa and who guided us, rather forcefully, to the spa and the waiting room. After a few minutes, and noticing that another group of three persons in the waiting area also seemed a bit confused, I went back outside to check the number of the door of the building we had been led to (there was no real name displayed anywhere, probably deliberately) and realised it did not correspond to the address I had for Medina Spa. I then walked out of the door and back into the alley and (despite insistent shouts of \"my friend, my friend, where are you going\" from the same guy) found the correct spa at the end of the alley. We then left the first place and went to the real Medina spa. The other spa is located just before Medina spa (which is right at the end of the alley, on the right, when coming from the place Jemaa Fna, talking the Rue Des Banques), which is confusing at the best of times and obviously this person was taking advantage of that. Be warned, this type of deliberate deception seems to, unfortunately, be quite common in Marrakech."

This despite showering every day etc. Grossant oil was applied (a combination of seven oils) and after a final shower we left for the next stage.Upstairs we were given a half hour massage, the masseuse using Argon oil.

It was only supposed to be available through online booking, but the receptionist gave us the discount in person. We partook in a traditional hammam with scrub, body mask, hair mask, and sauna. It was truly lavish to be bathed and scrubbed. We then had an hour massage, one of which was a new form called the 'California Massage' which included deeper pressure and was wonderful. The staff spoke mostly french and arabic, but they had enough english to make themselves understood and the receptionist was fluent. Everyone was accommodating, hospitable, and it was one of the few relaxing experiences we had in Marrakech. On our way out, we couldn't help remarking on how soft our skin and hair was and how supple our muscles had become, what can we say, a true luxury. Also, they provided slippers, towels, robes, and lockers."

As a lone female attending a hammam it is always nerve wracking when you first go in but I was made very welcome and comfortable for the short wait until I was show to the dressing room. The Robes were clean and the shoes provided were comfy and clean. I was attended by one young woman who did not have much spoken English but was able to find gentle ways to move me here and there to follow the hammam process. Whilst I was uncertain about what happening, which oils and soaps were being used etc I was washed and scrubbed and then washed and rubbed into a relaxed state over a period of about 45 minutes. There is a lot of lying down, turning over and then getting up again, but she was a great assistant with calm direction and it felt like a patient and relaxed event. It was hot going at times but there was plenty of cool water on hand to splash my face, and when the lady realised I was overheating a quick word out the door and the steam was reduced in my spa room. On exit a sit down in the cool reception hall gazing up to the airy terraces of massage rooms above and a sip of the traditional mint tea... before dressing and exiting once again into the centre of the hustle bustle of Jma el Fna.Excellent location in the centre of town. A quiet back street just off the square makes it handy but also secluded from the main thoroughfare. Staff were helpful, discreet. Showed massive gratitude for the tip I gave but sought none at any stage in the process. Clean. Tidy. And at the special offer prices listed online for September not too expensive for a small treat. I would recommend for single females visiting the city. Not awkward or imposing here at all."

There was an on-line discount price for two (750DH for full Hamman and massage (1 hour). The Hamman (wash and scrub) was great and we got thoroughly cleansed and scrubbed. However, the foot level vents pushing out really hot steam were a health and safety disaster. I accidentally caught the vent with my heel and was promptly scalded. This developed into a full scale blister the following day. The massage was not bad. Although I did ask for a strong massage (the lady masseuse was gently tinkering about with my legs) I did not expect what felt like a chiropodist crack on my spine and ribs halfway through. This caused actual real pain and bruised my ribs. My wife's masseuse had rough hands which caused friction during the massage. A bit of a shame as we were up for a great relaxation and deep massage and cleanse. We did get pretty relaxed but with a heel blister and bruised rib, and roughed up skin we can't really recommend this."

We had looked on TA at loads of different ones but the top scorers were also rather expensive. The owner of our Riad suggested this one as it was only a short distance away and luckily some other guests we met at breakfast had been and said it was good. There are a few bad reviews of this place and I admit I was expecting to be disappointed but it was unfounded. There are young men who hang around at the top of the lane who will tell you it's closed or not very good but ignore them.We were shown to a changing room with a locker when we arrived and given slippers and dressing gowns to put on. We both kept our pants on as we weren't offered paper ones. I'm not that fussed about nudity but my daughter was a bit self conscious so the knickers stayed on! Having read other reviews it recommends checking online for special offers which we did and got an oriental relaxing treatment together for 250 dhs each. We asked our Riad owner to book it for us and there was no problem at the spa as some other visitors have experienced. We were both shocked at how much dead skin is scrubbed off but it looks and feels amazing afterwards. My daughter and myself both enjoyed this Spa very much and we did as much giggling as relaxing - particularly during the foot scrub. The massage was excellent - I've had lots of massages and this one was done very well with the perfect amount of pressure. Overall I would definitely recommend this place as a great value, clean and professional spa. If you want rose petals and 5 star luxury then maybe you'll be disappointed here but for a pretty cheap and relaxing couple of hours in very nice surroundings then this is a good option. One last thing, we didn't tip. Not because it wasn't worth it but because the owner of our Riad said it's not expected (some hammams forbid it) and also if you do tip then 20/50 dhs is fine. If I went again I would keep a couple of 20's in my gown pocket to tip the Hammam girl and masseuse separately. They disappear afterwards and I'm always dubious about tips going to the intended staff if you give them to someone else. "

But is was by far not the best massage I ever had. Half of the time the masseuse was texting or I don't know what she was doing with her mobile phone?! In my opinion it's quite inappropriate for the staff to keep their mobile phones (with camera function??) in their hands when a naked guest is laying on their massage table. But ethics aside, if at least the massage was of a great quality I wouldn't even mind that so much. But no, I was by far not the best massage I ever had. The moments she used her both hands were relaxing. But I didn't feel better than I did before the massage. She finalized the massage with a head massage with her oily hands, so I walked out of the hammam with terribly dirty greasy hair. The hammam treatments might be fine (didn't try it), but I would definitely not recommend this hammam for a massage."

We found this on the hammam website, the woman in charge initially pretended not to know about this. Like every thing in Morocco be very clear what you are asking for and what you will be paying. We got undressed ( just wore pants) and were taken into a steam room. We were washed and soaped, had the soles of our feet scrubbed, and left to sweat. After about 15 mins we were rinsed and scrubbed very vigorously. We were then covered in a clay like substance and left again. The young woman dealing with me was more thorough than the one washing my husband. After being rinsed again we went for the massage. The building is an old one, with very steep stairs to the massage rooms, so difficult if you have limited mobility( and wearing hammam shoes!) The two masseurs were very good, and thorough, but there was a lot of whispering between them at times, and the young woman who was massaging my husband had a very loud persistent sniff; both things did distract from a relaxing atmosphere at times.We were there for just over two hours, and I can recommend the experience."

If felt a little uncomfortable when, after scrubbing, the two attendants applied a tiny amount of mask on our bodies and just turned over and started talking to each other paying little attention to us. Eventually and after wandering what's going on for a while we left the hammam early for a massage which, as I said, was grand and worth visiting overall.

I was expecting a room with wonderful smells, good oil, etc, which did not happen. Service was below average (they only have small size robes and I was not offered a shower or the use of toilet after the massage, so I left all oily). Hygiene was fine, of what I could see. The price is not cheaper than I would pay in Europe for an average place. Overall, for the living cost in Marrakech, the cost is too high.But after 3 days of non stop walking, I gladly paid the price for a good massage, even if not the best place.

You're in a room where a woman literally scrubs you pretty forcefully, thus removing your dead skin and leaving you feeling like a newborn baby. Some may not be so comfortable here because others may be in the same room but the good thing is you're supposed to keep your underwear on (for those, like me, who are more prudish).After an hour, we had our massages. Mine was just ok. Poor girl must have been tired because she had no strength in her fingers. Left somewhat unimpressed (although the others in my party enjoyed their massages).One downside was that their credit card machine was broken and so they only accepted cash.

She doesn't speak English, but it didn't matter since she is a truly intuitive massage therapist. Although she is quite small, she is incredibly strong and gets out every last knot in your back and neck. The institute itself is lovely and serene. We had a hammam/massage package but the hammam was nothing special. The steam room was not warm enough and the hammam scrub didn't use black soap (the package was from Carrefour!) or good implements. The hammam part was rather awkward, but we had a lovely spot to relax post hammam and had mint tea while we waited for the massage part. Unlike many spas/hammams in Marrakech, couples are allowed to be together during the hammam and massage which made for a nicer experience. This was truly a treat and worth doing!"

Forget all the other places in Marrakech and head here for the BEST experience ever! It is intimate, relaxing, very thorough, and at no point did I feel uncomfortable despite being virtually naked. Ask for Fatima (I think that was her name) She is pretty amazing and made me feel comfortable and SO relaxed after! Completely skilled and professional ! I booked to have a Thai massage after. I would suggest to avoid this. Stick to the Hamman. It is completely amazing enough to make you fully relaxed. I have had many many Thai massages and have been to Thailand numerous times. This is no way lives up to the Thai massages that are for one tenth of the price. They did not seem to know the pressure points as well nor applied the pressure in the right way. My friend was also disappointed with the Thai massage but very very happy with the Hamman.Forget all the rest, book your hamman here. It is the best and super clean too!"

Having read the reviews during 2013 we booked a Hamman & Massage.This was our first Hamman & will not be our last, it was firm but once you got used to the pressure used it was an experience not to be missed. This was carried out in a professional way but virtually no part of either of our bodies were spared. My Wife was given a micro thong for the Hamman & I was given a waterproof covering that looked more like a see though Shower Cap. This seemed quite strange but once we got past the intial embarrassing part it was well worth it.This followed by a short relaxing break during which we were given a refreshing drink.Our one & a half hour Thai Massage with oil was carried out in the same room which I found a lttle too hot but was about the right temporature for my Wife.We both had a Medium to Firm Massage & both Thai Ladies ensured that they unlocked any tension we may have had, it was certainly firm bordering on brutal at times but we both felt much better once they had finished. They both concentrated on areas that needed extra pressure but i dont think we needed to tell them where as she found the areas on my back & shoulders that needed the extra attention.As stated in a previous review we were once again given the skimpiest of clothing to wear, my wife yet again had the tiniest thong imagionable & I was given underwear with slightly more material but it was never going to cover what it was suposed to cover which I am sure probably cheared up the masseuse. It was advertised as a full body massage & both of us felt that this was as close to a full body massage as you could get whilst still being professional. As you can imagine the clothing given actually seemed pointless but the towels did cover our modesty for some of the time. This did not put us off having a second masage at the Baan Thai & we both had another hour & a half massage without the Hamman but on this occasion we had the medium massage which was out of this world & left us totally relaxed. We will definately go back to the Baan Thai when we return to Marrakech in the future. Colin & Nicola.West Sussex."

Ladies, be prepared for the Hammam - they really do wash everywhere, which, as a Brit, was a little disconcerting!! She was also VERY harsh with the loofah, having said that I came out with skin like a new born and feeling better than I had in months.

However, my friends kept discouradging me by showing me reviews about Hamman treatments that involved being washed with boiling water and touched in private areas (which does sound a bit scary I must admit). But I just knew these reviews must be over exaggerated so I decided to give it a try anyways.I was suggested a Spa nearby our Riad - the Farnatchi Spa. Its a nice looking spa with a typical Maroccan design (which I fancy very much). The reception lady was nice and welcoming, spoke very good English and put a lot of effort into making me feel comfortable. Then the 'lady' that was doing the Hammam came and took me to the sauna area. The Hammam tretament was very discrete. I didnt experience any awkward touching, rubbing or scratching. Since the Hammam treatment is usually followed by a massage, I had to wait around 10 minutes until the 'lady' prepared the massage room. That wasnt a problem either. I was chating with the reception lady while drinking a cup of verbena tea in a beautiful welcoming hall, which you can see on the picture. Then I had an hour long relaxing massage. I trully recommend the Farnatchi Spa. It was so relaxing! The only reason I am not giving them the highest rating is that I found it a bit too pricy."

I'm quite disappointed that we did not get the wonderful experience everyone else wrote on TripAdvisor.. When we walked inside the spa, 2 ladies eventually showed up to greet us. Neither spoke English; quite hard to communicate. We told them we'd like to get a massage, they told us to sit down and wait; one lady left through one door I'm assuming to get the rooms ready. We waited in awkward silence for at least 10 minutes; the lady who stayed behind didn't speak a word of English nor offer us a drop of water.Now to the massages, we were led through one of the doors leading upstairs, my husband through one room and I next door. This is where it started to get bad. Unfortunately I got the \"new\" lady. I kept emphasizing I like hard pressure and we were paying extra for deep tissue massages. She was basically rubbing oil on my body and when I asked her to put more pressure, she would sigh and say \"more? More?!\" She also yawned about 10 times during the first 40 minutes. Then all of a sudden, she told me to relax and left the room. I thought maybe she was getting hot towels or hot stones or.. something. I was left alone for 5 MINUTES. I only know because I got up to check the time. I was fed up at this point, I opened the door and she was sitting right by the room and jumped up when I came out. I asked what the heck is going on and she hurried back in the room and kept telling me to relax and lay back down. Then she started wiping the oil off with a dried towel. Finished. I got up and was obviously pissed. She asked me if I was ok and I said no I'm not. I paid for a 60 minute deep tissue massage and you basically did 40 minutes then left for 5 minutes. She started to freak out and offered me to lay back down for 15 more minute massage. At this point I had enough and I'm not sure how 15 minutes of her terrible massage would make the situation better. After a few minutes of going back and forth, I asked her to please leave the room so I can get dressed.  Let me just say I've gotten massages from Thailand, Cancun, Dominica Republic, multiple places in NY and VA in the States. I've never had a masseuse leave towards the end of the massage and tell me to \"relax\" and just lay there. Ridiculous. The only reasons I'm giving them 2 stars is because apparently my husband had a wonderful massage and the spa is beautiful inside and high technology (built in sound system and thermostat in each room) They did end up giving a 30% credit towards our bill but i would NOT recommend this place for getting massages. You never know if you might end up getting the masseuse I got."

Farnatchi Spa is light, elegantly designed with traditional and modern twists. The Spa was immaculately clean and the welcome was second to non. I went for one of their Ila treatments, the Vital wellbeing and a Royal Hammam and came out feeling like a new person. I will no longer be looking for other spas on future visits to Marrakech as I would only end up being disappointed."

We popped in initially just to enquire about the facilities and wow, what a place. A beautifully fitted out traditional building, light, airy and very welcoming. We were shown the tariff of treatments available (very extensive) and all very reasonably priced. No high pressure selling techniques just the offer of a mint tea or fruit juice while we browsed. We both booked a Hammam, a traditional steam bath and scrub similar to a Turkish bath. I opted for the back massage and Karen opted for the full body massage. My back massage must have been good as I fell asleep at the end! Feeling fully rejuvenated it was an experience well worth the money and I would definitely recommend a visit if you're looking for a completely relaxing experience. Karen certainly enjoyed it and booked a facial for the following day. It was whilst waiting for her I was shown around the Riad Farnatchi, I'll review that separately so as not to ramble on too much. But if you're visiting Marrakesh, put Farnatchi Spa on your \"to do\" list."

We all opted for a Royal Hammam which was an hour's treatment and included a full body scrub using the traditional black soap with lovely eucalyptus oils, a body mask and finished off with a super massage. I had previously had a hammam at Les Bains de Marrakesh on a different trip but the three others in our party had never experienced it before. From the moment we arrived we were looked after and put at ease. I found the staff to be so much friendlier and more professional here and they all speak good English and are able to explain the treatments to you - which was very helpful for my friends who had no idea what a hammam involved. My boyfriend and I were in one Hammam and our two friends in another. It was an incredible experience and every effort was made to ensure we were looked after and felt comfortable. The spa itself was really clean and beautifully styled - I loved the way it has been designed and renovated with such authenticity whilst at the same time seeming modern and simple and CLEAN. The tranquility of the spa is miraculous as you are right in the heart of the medina. I would love to visit Farnatchi again and might try a massage next time. Apparently they have one of the best trained masseurs in Marrakesh!"

I imagined that the purpose of the hamman is to relax, be diverted, and to cleanse, and the massage to aliviate aches and pains - and at the Farnatchi my expectations were exceeded. The tranquility achieved in the marble hamman was just what I needed and I had been nervous in advance. In addition the staff gave me excellent recommendations on restaurants and shops, which greatly enhanced my stay. If I could stay at the Farnatchi Riad one day, I would be very happy. VC"

As a resident of Marrakech I am always searching for new experiences and in particular, the traditional ritual of a Moroccan hammam. I spotted a sign for a new spa in my neighbourhood as I was on my way to the souks, and out of curiosity, I walked through the discreet doorway signed Farnatchi Spa and arrived into a naturally lit reception area where already my senses were awakened. Subtle scents, gentle and appropriate music and I was greeted by professional and friendly staff. Sometimes spas can be a bit intimidating for first-timers, particularly those who are visiting solo, but this was certainly not. I immediately booked a treatment then and there. After a particularly hectic week, I chose a 1-hour oriental facial designed to hydrate the skin, and was escorted into a moodily-lit, traditional-style treatment room where I experienced the most soothing and gentle facial I could have wished for. I was so taken with the spa that I booked in for a hammam a few days later and that was an equally cleansing, nourishing and pampering hour in an otherwise busy day. I look forward to the opening of their spa lunch spot on their cleverly-designed sun terrace which I believe is imminent. Go to TripAdvisor | Privacy Policy | Co"

A lovely place to relax and be attended on by very professional staff - the hammam experience of being soaped and scrubbed down was quite fun - especially if you are sharing it with someone else! Then the medium massage that I had was 'just right'. They manage you along the process gently with glasses of water and peppermint tea at the end - the whole experience was about 2 hours for us - we had the Signature Treatment I think - about 750DHM each.

I booked this for my girlfriends birthday as we have never really tried a Spa day before.We paid for the Mythic Relax which was the massage and the facial as a package.When looking for the venue, keep an eye for the signs, then walk down the alleyways and search for a black door with the sign \"Mythic Oriental Spa\". A local kindly directed us to the venue as we clearly looked lost! hahaFrom the moment we entered the building, you walk into an Oasis. You can hear birds chirping and flying around (1-2 from what we could see). It's a welcome breather from the hectic Marrakech that we have grown to know over the course of 3-4 days.You are given a choice of drinks for a start and once you are ready, the staff take you to the changing room to change into their provided underwear. I was fine with my disposable boxers but the girlfriend did not feel hers was adequate so asked if she could stay in her swimwear, which the staff kindly reassured her was ok.The facial was first and as it was the first time for me, I found it a little weird at first having someone cream, scrub and squeeze my blackheads (I'm a male) but eventually got into it as I relaxed throughout the treatment. The girlfriend found the facial fantastic and this was long overdue as she has been so busy with work and life etc.Then came the massage, my girlfriend opted for the relaxing massage, I went for the strong massage. My masseuse was very firm and really hit the right spots, she really went into my knots in my back and applied the right amount of pressure on the legs. Please be warned, I am used to strong massages as I do a lot of sports/gym work, so I have it regularly and I am used to this pressure!The girlfriend loved her relaxing massage as it was something she was looking forward to all morning. Overall, we spent 3 hours there and the staff ensured we felt as relaxed and comfortable as possible.I would recommend this for anyone who would like to de-stress after a long hard day of exploring the busier side of the Medina and wants to relax in a little paradise that is on the outskirts of the medina."

Tucked away behind the bustle of Larrousse this oasis of tranquility cannot be beaten ! For 3 and a half hours ( session was described as 2 hrs ) the attention to care and dedication to total relaxation were utmost in all the spas staff from the moment of stepping across the doorway . Nothing rushed and complete pampering followed with refreshing cool drinks , juices and snacks with a surprising birthday cake and rendition of happy birthday by all the ladies in both Morrocan and English !! The Hammam experience in the steam rooms with eucalyptus is one you will never forget !! You will understand this more once you have experienced it ! Relaxing baths with mineral salts follow and tranquil music in darkened candle lit rooms full of incense and warmth . The hour long full body massage will put you into a state of total relaxation and it is difficult not to simply fall into a deep state of sleep ! Refreshing mint tea and a time to regather ones thoughts are all that is required before then leaving this little gem of a piece of paradise and renter the bustle of the medina just a foot outside the door ! Amazing and unforgettable , thank - you !"

She fell asleep after on the table due to the soft music. I really liked my masseuse - Souad - highly recommended. We met the owner Florent on the way out - he is a perfect gentleman - excusing himself for his poor English which was actually much better than my french. I will definitely recommend the place to others as a way to relax and de-stress in Marrakech"

Overall the 2hr was good. we had a hamman followed by an hour long massage for which we could choose our own scent which was a lovely idea. Before the hamman we were given a complimentary 'foot massage' - this had the potential to be a lovely start but instead the therapist spent it shouting to her colleague down the corridor so was not relaxing! The hamman was good, but again unprofessional because our lady forgot to apply the black soap scrub so after drying off we then had to de-robe and get back in. We didn't mind at the time but in hindsight it was disappointing considering the expensive price tag. The massage was lovely, my partner and I had it in the same room and they were very thorough. But again there were a couple of things that were unprofessional. Firstly my masseuse yawned the whole way through very close to my face! The second was that for quite long periods of time I was massaged with just one hand, and I later overhead an argument where a client claimed that the masseuse was on her phone whilst giving a massage! Overall the spa was lovely, a very relaxing haven within Marrakech but clearly a lack of professionalism at times."

For example, during our hour long couples message, my right foot received an inordinate amount of focus with a lot of mumbled chatter between the two masseuses. Afterwards, I found out my wife's left foot received the same level of treatment... I guess there was some juicy gossip that day. Whatever the cause, it was not the most professional experience.

Even my bathrobe and slippers were the right size for me! I'm small and usually disappear in the standard-size robes most spas provide. To say attention is paid to every detail is an understatement.

It was not crowded with customers when we were there, and staff treated us attentively. During the 1 hr massage, my boyfriend and I both asked to be massaged harder, but the staff were responsive. Thanks for a great time!"

We booked a visit here whilst staying in Marrakech and were daft enough to try to get here on foot. Thankfully the riad we were staying in had free wifi and we had managed to glean just enough information from other traveller's visits to manage to find it!Tucked away down a labyrinth of narrow alleys, just outside the famous souks is a slighlty ornate door with a small placard that gives the first hint that the place you are visiting is very different from it's surroundings.You are welcomed by a very friendly host and as soon as the door closes behind you the noise, the smells and the dust of the streets of Marrakech are gone and replaced by a still, sweet smelling paradise! I won't give too much of the experience away but you are guided professionally and quietly around this hidden oasis and treated to some of the most relaxing and indulgent spa treatments you can imagine. The paper underwear you are given does little to hide your modesty so bear that in mind if you are of a shy or nervous disposition but the staff do do a wonderful job of putting you at ease. It's difficult to say how long the experience lasted as time seems to just melt away whilst you are here. I have only ever been to one such spa in my life and frankly I wouldn't want to try anywhere else for fear of it not living up to the standard of this visit. My better half does have more experience of spa days and tells me this was by far and away the best she had ever visited. I would highly recommend a visit here for anyone visiting Marrakech. Everything about it was superb. The adventure of finding it, the miraculous transition from the dust and bustle of the streets to this hidden oasis of calm, the lavish treatment whilst you are there... all if it was fantastic!"

They offer you traditional Moroccan pastries and tea at the end. When you leave, they offer you to take a picture of the patio and send it to you.- You can come at any time before your treatment; you can wait in the sunny terrace where they propose you a traditional mint tea or orange juice.- The treatments list is extensive - The mythic signature massage and Mythic signature face treatment are really nice, they take great care of you.- Decoration inside is nice, typically Moroccan and soothing."

We were treated like princesses, and it was 3 hours of pure relaxation and being pampered.Be prepared to have an unusual once in a lifetime experience, but come out feeling sparkling clean and completely relaxed. The traditional scrub is unlike anything you would get in England, but was definitely worth doing if you are in Marrakech.The facilities were great, and the staff were very welcoming and friendly.

As other reviewers have mentioned there is a lot of waiting around & I would liked to have had some sort of steam room to relax in and enjoy.

After tea and changing our clothes, we started with a short foot massage, then we went into the aromatic steam room. The hammam table was a little small and narrow, but manageable. The staff member did a great job with the exfoliation, followed by a room with candles, low lights, and quiet music for the wonderful and relaxing massage. At every rest point or transition room, there was a table with seats, drinks, and at the end, some sweets. This place would be difficult to find on your own; a taxi dropped us nearby and a staff member met us to walk in. When we left, we had a hard time getting a taxi, and it turned out he got lost and couldn't find our hotel. 45 minutes later and after several stops to ask for directions, we arrived. This isn't directly the problem of the spa, but the neighborhood was a concern."

Upon arriving in Marrakech for the first time you can be forgiven for feeling a little apprehensive, you may decide like us to relax first day at your riad too scared to venture out! On your second day you decide to walk outside into the chaos that is the medina, go for a stroll around the souk fearing for your life as motorbike after motorbike zooms past you occasionally brushing your arm. You return to your riad feeling a little stressed you eat a comforting kofte tajine and fall asleep.It was at this point on our third day we first visited this wonderful hammam and spa, it's difficult to find in amongst the riad Laarous square but worth the effort. We found a small sign on a wall pointing down a little alleyway, by now getting used to the chaotic streets we strolled down to find a discreet wooden door with the name 'mythic oriental spa', again feeling a little apprehensive we knocked three times...A lovely young lady with a huge smile on her face greeted us and welcomed us inside to a beautiful 3 story building very similar to our luxurious riad. We were offered a drink - gratis which in itself is something not often seen in Marrakech. Another lady greeted us again with an English menu of treatments - my partner had already exclaimed \"were having the full package no matter the cost\" No doubt the first two days had taken their toll on her :) The full package included a hammam, black soap exfoliation, covering us in mud, a salt bath and a full body massage totalling 1450dhs per person. No need to bring any clothes here as they provide temporary underwear and bath robes - the women's underwear I found quite funny on my partner but I won't spoil it and I am a big kid, the men's though we're just some basic black boxer shorts which are thrown away afterwards.At the beginning you are given some water to drink with slices of orange in whilst they offer you six different items to smell, you then choose your favourite for your massage oil and we also got to choose our favourite bath salts.Rather than talk you through the rest of the experience I will just tell you it is amazing way better than any spas my partner has been to in the UK - this is my first spa. Your skin will feel better than it ever has I was blown away!Once your treatments are over you are taken to the roof terrace for a Moroccan tea and some sweet pastries its sublime!When we went downstairs and got dressed we were taken to the till to pay and without bartering at all we were charged 900dhs each a lovely surprise, we gave a generous tip and left feeling ready to take on the medina and anything it could throw at us! Today is our last day and to finish the trip off we visited again and we thoroughly enjoyed it just as much! Marrakech is a city full of chaos and beauty, do not miss out on this thoroughly relaxing and enjoyable treat!"

After a lovely hammam, oriental bath and the best massage I've ever had we were treated to tea and Moroccan pastries on the terrace.If you don't do anything else whilst in Marrakech, treat yourself to a visit to the Mythic Oriental Spa, it's near the Riad Larousse."

My wife and I have been to spas all over the world and I have to put Mythic Oriental Spa near the top of the list in terms of best overall experience. The spa itself is a bit tricky to find but Zineb (the person who booked our appointment via email) met us at our drop off and made sure we arrived safely and without distraction. Once inside, my wife and I enjoyed a package that included a private Hammam, full body exfoliation and deep tissue massage. Each phase of the experience transitioned perfectly with the establishment as a whole and team members being first rate! I will not hesitate to book again the next time we are in Morocco."

The spa is difficult to find but I suppose this is the case for a lot of things in the center of Marrakesh, we were greeted and ushered to change, had a foot massage and full body scrub and hammam, then a full body massage followed by a delicious tea on the top floor, the building is beautiful and everyone is very welcoming.I would love to go back and recommend 100%"

Then they take you to clean your feet with some warm towels, I wish there would have been some massage involved in it, but it was sooo quick, until here it felt like you were in a MASSAGE FACTORY, and it is truth, it felt like they were in a rush to finish the session. Then came the Hamman, we booked a \u201cdeal\u201d of 1800 DIRHAMS for a couple, where it said that the Hamman lasted 30 minutes and it had to be per person, but the Hamman lady was, again, so in a rush that it must had lasted 15 minutes each, if so.. it was a very good hamman though, she did good pressure just wish it would have lasted what I paid for! Then it came the massage which was the bit that kind of save the feeling of being MUGGED WITH AN OVERPRICED PACKAGE, as the massage was actually good, a bit more pressure would have been nice, especially when we told the nice girl in the reception that we wanted the hard massage, but it was nice and relaxing, so we left like eemm ok it was not that bad.. but that is not the feeling you want to leave with for that much money paid! Especially when there are other better places for less than that. Would I go back? Maybe for the massage if the price goes down."

We had a 1 hour hammam treatment - I dont want to tell the details here, because I think you should enjoy and not know all the details. This was followed by a 1 hour full body massage...then some mint tea and sweets, relaxing on a balcony in a riad. You can just go there as you are. Towels, disposable underwear, changing rooms, lockers, bath rope etc all provided. My advice for girls (hair): after the hamman and massage my hair was all messed up. There is a shower, but no shampoo/ conditioner/ comb and no hairdryer. Before you go anywhere else after the spa you might consider going back to your hotel to have a shower, wash your hair and dry it. Before leaving you can fill in a form rating the service. They are asking for your email....well, you might not want spam mails, but they are so lovely to take pictures of you and will send them to you via mail."

Hence you are even more stressed before you enter. Your taxi driver will drop you off in what I would describe as a large and very busy square.To confirm that you are in the right place, look for the lone tall palm tree. If you cant see it, you are in the wrong place.Once you see the palm tree, look for the shop 'Pharmacie Populaire.With the Pharmacie directly behind you, walk opposite and away from it. Keep walking until you see a small sign at about two metres high up on a left wall facing you 'Rue El Gza'This proves you are going in the right direction. Keep walking straight ahead.After about 150 metres you will see a sign also about 2 metres high up on the wall which says Mythic Oriental Spa, with an arrow pointing to the right. As of Christmas 2013 this is the only sign.Follow the sign to the right for about 100 metres and you will see a door in a wall to you right.You have arrived.Did I enjoy it? Yes. My Christmas present to me. Thank you to me.There are other reviews on here which explain the process of what will happen. I found them to be correct and very useful."

Lady was unsmiling and looked quite miserable, making it a tad uncomfortable to be honest, and it was over very very quickly. In contrast the massage was one of the best i've had, lasted the full hour, felt like more. We were then invited to have mint tea and biscuits up on the roof terrace, which was a lovely end to the day. All in all well worth the money especially with the package deal. Would recommend."

Two things that really stood out to me were that a) the therapists were giving one another a manicure in the central courtyard in front of guests and b) my masseuse's nails were so long they were scratching me during my massage!That being said, the ladies showed true Moroccan hospitality and were very pleasant throughout.

On returning home after our full day out that ended here we realise it was a marvellous day out- brilliant value for money and so relaxing. I would recommend this highly. If you buddy it up with the cookery class you get a great full day out - the ultimate in relaxation. We had Hammans elsewhere but nothing quite as relaxing and tranquil as this. They take their time here which is just what you want for a little escape from the chaos that is the centre of Marrakech. Thanks. xx"

We opted for a package, black soap, scrub and massage.I've been to a few hammans so knew what to expect, but no one asked if we'd done this type of thing before or offered to explain what was going to happen. This would be helpful to people if it was there first experience of a hamman.The bad bits:I didn't feel the personal service I'd expect. It was very much like being part of a production line with the aim to get you in and out.This isn't an authentic hamman, it's been designed specifically for western tourists, which is fine if this is what you are looking for.The steam room where you are washed and scrubbed was a bit tatty and no where near hot enough (steamy for my liking)The pressure to fill a customer satisfaction form was irritating. I appreciate they're useful to them, but I haven't paid a fair bit of money for an experience to be told to fill one out- no thanks, I'm not on a school tripsWe visited towards the end of the day and asked if they could organise a taxi. This seemed like a huge inconvenience to the receptionist who told us they were closing. In the end she agreed to walk us to an area where we could get a taxi, but begrudgingly.The good bits:The massage was excellent. The masseurs are clearly well trained in anatomy and the pressure was perfect for me. The masseurs were happy to take direction if required(softer, harder ect) I would have liked to have tipped my masseur, but as we were rushed out I didn't have the opportunity.Would I recommend this place or go back again? No, the overall experience wasn't that great, there's much better hammans in Marrakech"

Entering through the front door of the spa from the nondescript, narrow back alley it is located on is an astounding experience. The moment you enter you are hit by silence and a sense of calm tranquility.The ladies at the spa were very attentive before our session began, and provided us with refreshments. They were also very discreet and professional, and did not make us feel uncomfortable at any point. The hammam was incredibly cleansing with Moroccan black soap, exfoliation and a mud wrap, and after the relaxing bath that followed (with freshly squeezed orange juice) we both felt the cleanest we had ever been. We then experienced an hour of an enjoyable and relaxing massage each, followed by small edible refreshments and mint tea. My massage was perfect, but my girlfriend found hers a bit rough on parts of her back - something I'm sure you could ask to be gentler when there.I cannot recommend this strongly enough, and both my girlfriend and I consider this to have been the highlight of our trip to Marrakech. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would. At only ~\u00a360 per person, you'd be crazy not to make this a part of your holiday, and if we ever go to Marrakech again then we'll certainly be booking another round!"

The building is hidden in a narrow street and you only find one sign on the main road but no further help from there. I arrived a bit early for my appointment. They offered me mint tea and told me to relax and then we will start the treatment. This was my first hammam experience, but the ladies were not particularly helpful. They speak limited english and could not explain the process properly. In case you intend to visit, here is a short guide what to expect: after arriving you will be seated in the lounge and have tea. Then you will go and change, they give you single use underwear so don't worry about bringing your own swimsuit. You will have a gown and slippers. After this you will be offered some water and they will ask you to choose a scent for the massage oil. First they will take you for the hammam. It will start with a very short foot massage then you will be taken into a room. You will sit / lie on a stone bench while they wash you with warm water. They apply the black soap and will leave you in the room for about 5 minutes. After this they wash the soap off and they will scrub / exfoliate your skin with a special glove which feels like having your skin sandpapered. It is very refreshing and invigorating though. After rinsing all the soap off you will be offered a towel and pair of dry underwear. You will wait in the main patio for the message. The message lasts about an hour and when they finish they will leave you alone in the room to relax for about 10-15 minutes. You will be offered tea and some sweets. You then go and change and the treatment is finished. Altogether I had a good experience, however more information would be helpful for those who have never visited a hammam or had their body scrubbed before. The offer together with the cooking class is a very good value for money and very refreshing after a long day."

We were taken to the riad (Mythic Oriental Spa) as part of the package although I could imagine it would be hard to find if you set off alone. What a fascinating, beautiful setting inside Mythic Oriental Spa. We were greeted warmly and offered welcoming, cleansing drinks - changed into robes etc and provided with large secure lockers for our clothes and valuables. This was an interesting and funny experience: if you get the black soap in your eye do not try to wash it out with the water as it may be salty; full body frontal washing and massage (unlike in UK) and one member of our party had the shock of her life as this was her first ever massage. Please note though that all very discrete and a great way to bond with family and friends. The rose petals laid out on the massage beds was a nice touch. Mythic Oriental Spa had a nice ambience but the ultimate \"to cap it off\" experience was the rooftop which would not have been out of place in a Vogue fashion shoot or hip hop video - an inky blue sky with twinkling stars. Relaxing, refreshing and rejuvenating - yes it was pricy but the drinks and nibbles on the roof top were out of this world. A fabulous ending to a wonderful day. A cab to our hotel would have been 100 dirham from the spa but the lady gave us directions from Mythic Oriental Spa to the main square - basically left, left, left and we got a cab from there - the driver wanted to charge 200 dirham but settled for 30 dirham when we advised him we were not first timers (although we were)! Mythic Oriental Spa also sold some lovely expensive t-shirts which I was nearly tempted to buy. A photo at the end of the experience was taken and posted to us a memory - a nice touch."

At that time, they did not know I was just standing near the door entrance of the pantry. In their conversation, they found that my questions and requests brought them much trouble.

There are no street signs in Marrakech, lots of tiny alleyways which do not seem to relate to the map we had! We would, however, not have missed the experience for the world. My husband and I had the couples ritual which lasted about 2.5 hours. Starting with the black soap wash followed by a body scrub and a type of mud mask (?).

Going through the Medina is very interesting but when you go through the door of the Mythic Oriental Spa, you enter into a whole new world. Wow!! we were totally taken by surprise. The decor was amazing, each room was better than the other and everything was extremely clean and well kept, true luxury. Since, I was with my boyfriend we did every treatment as a couple, We started with a refreshment, orange juice for him and mint tea for me. We were then escorted to the changing room and then to pick out our desired scents. Treatment started in the steam room which included being washed by a women. Lets me say this, Hammam is an experience, from the black soup wash and the full body scrub was not only excellent and the ladies are very professional and make you feel totally at ease. After a cool drink we went upstairs into another beautifully decorated room for our massage. Minutes into it, I could hear my boyfriend snoring and I was on my way to join him. I'm not sure how long we slept but we both felt very relaxed and refreshed when we woke up. From that room we continued up to the top balcony in our robes and slippers, where we joined the rest of our friends. We sat there for a few, enjoyed more drinks, the cool evening breeze and the sunset. What away to end a full day. It's a total experience, from the treatments to the lovely staff. The ladies are just that, ladies. They are extremely professional and very nice. We tipped and thanked them all and we did leave without buying soaps and oils. We all agreed that we wish we had more time in Marrakech so we come back and try other treatments. This is a must try and a definite place to revisit on my trip back. That you Ladies great job and keep it up."

We fully appreciated this even after we had dried off and got changed into our spa robes and fresh spa underwear. The assortment of refreshments offered at every pause between treatments was also a nice touch and our massages were very relaxing. We both felt suitably pampered after the whole experience and slept well in our beds that evening.The slight difficulty we had was that the place was a little hard to find on foot.

We then went to another room for our 20min slimming wrap which also helps the skin and pores.After being washed down again, we were taken to a very warm jacuzzi where we were presented with more orange juice. The service could not be faulted, this is exactly what we needed after our hammam.We were then taken to a room upstairs where we had our massages in a room together. Pure relaxation!An hour later, we were led to the roof terrace where we were treated to mint tea and some Morrocan cakes.All in, a wonderful experience and would definitely come back to Marrakech just to go back to Mythic Oriental."

After cooking we turned up to the the Spa and we were taken a back by how nice the place was. Going down the small alley ways we certainly weren't expecting to see such a well decorated place. The ladies there were very friendly(spoke English which helped). We were offered drinks. We were only waiting 15 minutes when we experienced the Hammam followed by a full body massage. Both of which were great. Then we were walked onto the rooftop where we could relax until we were ready to leave.An amazing experience had from start to finish. I would reccommend to all if you want to relax amongst all the hustle and bustle off Marrakesh."

This Hammam is incredibly luxurious, amazing personal service from the moment you step into the beautiful Riad. The massage was divine, and a bonus for couples is that you get your treatments together in the same room, unlike many other Hammams which separate the sexes.The experience went beyond our expectations and was faultless from start to finish. Will definitely book a return visit when next in Marrakech."

As we were a group of 11 people, we had to divide into 3 groups. One group could start immediately with the whole treatment and the rest had to wait for a while. This was not a problem as we could spend the waiting time on the fantastic rooftop terrace with its relaxing ambiance and enjoyed ourselves in the whirlpool where time passed really fast. Soon, we could start with our first hamam experience that we enjoyed to the full. After the foot cleanse, we were washed in the steam bath and scrubbed. The highlight of the whole treatment was the extraordinary one hour massage after which we all felt very relaxed."

Earlier in the day my girlfriend and I attended a fantastic cookery course with the affable and slightly eccentric Michel at Faim d'Epices and decided to opt for the full day package which concluded with a hammam and massage at Mythic Oriental Spa. On arrival we were greeted by smiley faces and mint tea and shown to some comfy sofas for a few minutes so we could take in our surroundings and wind down from the chaos that is Marrakech. When we were ready we were taken to a private room where we were given a foot massage, next came the hammam, which if truth be told was slightly disappointing, the room was small, cramped and a little uncomfortable and our 'scrub and wash' lasted no more than a 5-10 minutes each. Once we dried off we were taken for our massage, which in my opinion was the real highlight. An hour later I floated from the treatment room to another comfy sofa for another cup of well received mint tea. Before leaving we posed for some photos with the staff which were emailed to us on our return. I would certainly recommend this spa; it is good value for money, the staff are very friendly, attentive and good at what they do, the property (riad) is beautifully maintained, the mint tea is very tasty and we both left feeling very calm and rejuvenated before re-entering mayhem outside."

Then we started our hammam. we were provided with paper undies to protect our modesty. Then we had our feet washed and our bodies washed with black argan soap- lovely - BUT don't touch your eyes - it stings if you get it in your eyes. We were then scrubbed with a glove and washed down - which included a small bucket of water being poured over you - its better than it sounds. very invigorating. Then we had a massage- out of this world- in a darkened room with soft music and lovely oils. I had a gentle massage ( by request ) and my husband had a stronger massage. we were served mint tea at the end too. The staff were calm, professional and polite and we felt very comfortable there.

However 45 minutes later and still nobody even bothering to even talk to us, we got a bit anxious and asked how long - eventually we were told 'maybe another 15-20 minutes' by the young and definitely un-apologetic manager....Basically we could see that they had overbooked with people - presumably coming in on spec - whereas as part of the deal with the cookery school we were probably lower margin business.Anyhow we decided not to wait and walked out. The place looked OK but needs to sort out its booking system and service, given the prices it charges.....at no time did we feel that anybody really cared that we were being kept waiting.

We had had a great day there then were brought right to the spa (good thing...we would never have have found it on our own). It was like an oasis in the middle of the Medina desert! We were greeted with tea (of course), asked to choose what type of scented oil we liked and given robes to change into before we went into the warm room for the black soap and hot water splooshing. Nice to be able to go as a couple. We were left to warm through after the first dunking and then given another rinse before we went into the hammam scrub room. The girl was working hard! You could see little balls of dead skin rolling off! We went back to the warm room for another rinse then off the the massage room. From what I saw on other reviews, it seems like some people come more for a quick treatment than a relaxing time. This is not the place to get that. Enjoy the laid back pace. It is a spa!The massage was fabulous. My wife got the relaxing massage, without asking for it, and I got the real work down massage....without asking for it. Just what each of us like. Again it was nice to be in the same room while this was being done.Afterward, we were given time to relax in a quiet room with some tea or water, whatever we preferred. Nobody rushing you out to make from for the next customer, just a really peaceful time. We ended up buying some of the oils that were used on us to take home. Pretty hard to recreate the whole experience but we'll get part way there!Overall, a great experience in a welcoming atmosphere at a reasonable price. We loved it."

The atmosphere is very nice but if you want an actual spa experience where you feel re-energized and refreshed afterwards (and that something was actually changed) then this is not it.

We had no idea what to expect and what exactly we got from a hamen massage, as no one has written here exactly what happens i will go through it.On arrival we were warmly welcomed and shown where to get changed into dressing gowns and shoes (everything was very clean which was a really big thing we were worrying about). We were then shown to a little private section where we enjoyed orange enthused water. Then we picked the sented oil we wanted for our massage.After this we were taken through and given a foot massage with a warm towel which was Devine. Then shown into a sort of steam room where they rub you down with a sort of oil and then bath u then leave u to sort of soak in the oil after about 10-15mins they come and wash it off(myself and my girlfriend were feeling quiet awkward about being topless but they made us feel so comfortable). After this they took as through to a room where they did a sort of exfoliation with rough glove with black sand and oil, which was so nice and you could see all the dead skin they got off your body which was excellent. You then go back to the 'steam room' and are bathed again and asked to wash ur hair.Then comes the massage. We entered the room and they put on some relaxing Moroccon music and lit candles. The lights were then turned off so the room was lit just by candles (obviously not pitch black) and we got on the tables (we had out massage together). We were feeling again quiet awkward about being basically naked, but the staff made us feel so comfortable by covering the areas they weren't massaging with a towel.The massage was amazing! And when they say full body massage they mean it! We had every finger, every toe massaged! Even our heads and faces. People have written that it wasn't hard enough but I felt the pressure was just fine! And I'm sure u could specify if I had wanted it Harder.After the massage we had tea and busicuites on the roof terrace. People have also comment about the time factor but I feel they just don't want to rush you which I pressure to have then someone pushing u out the door. Also another comment about the price, I was very happy with the 750 dh (around \u00a365-\u00a370) as you are more or less having three treatment! There are places that charge less but you are defiantly getting a great service and I can assure everything is very clean which a lot of other places we looked at weren't. I highly recommend this place! 10 stars!!!!"

The actual massage was probably at most an hour, and not very effective . Perhaps I am just more used to massages where you feel they are trying to unknot tight muscles, rather than just waving their hands over you. The bath was a do it yourself job, where you sat on stone benches and poured water over you, and the scrub seemed to last about 10 min max . I suspect there is better value in Marrakech ."

The local children clearly are used to tourists making their way to the spa as they called out the number of the house as we approached in case we were not sure which door to knock. The welcome was warm and friendly and with a quick explanation of what to expect, we got started. Refreshments first and a chance to choose which scent for massage and bath, then a lovely foot massage to start the ritual. Washed with savon noir, steamed, scrubbed till pink and tingly then wrapped for the rassoul, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Became so relaxed, even dozed off a couple of times as the relaxing experience took effect. The massage was sublime and we were treated to refreshing tea and pastries as a final treat at the end of a wonderful experience. Would I recommend Mythic Oriental Spa? In a heartbeat. Very reasonable compared to London prices and delivered with warmth and care by the lovely staff. Hubby had never tried anything like this before, so he was well impressed.

This was the first time I had been to a spa in Marrakech, but had previous experience of others in Thailand, Vietnam and the UK of course. It was a bit of a risk as, rather than go with my husband, I took my 66 year old mom instead, leaving my husband to look after our two children (by the way, I don't think there would be anywhere for someone to sit and wait for you if they were not also having a spa session). We didn't know what to expect at the spa other than what I had read on trip advisor. I had pre-booked in the UK via email, and had received a prompt response in English and confirmation of our booking. The spa would have been difficult to find on our own, but we were guided by a teenage Boy (followed by his friends, obviously checking we were going to hand out money). For those yet to visit, from the square, where you get dropped off by a taxi, take the alley off which has a no entry sign for cars, walk slightly up hill, within just a few minutes, you will see a small general \" shop\" on your left, and opposite a turning to the right, the wall has a bold sign pointing the way to the spa; follow the alleyway down and round to the left, then right, the only route you can take if I remember correctly, the spa is on the corner before the alleyway turns again sharply to the left. As the other reviews say, don't let the alleyways and outside worry you, once you get into the spa, it is a different world! The girls were lovely, and spoke enough English to make it easy. We really enjoyed the experience - once I got over sitting next to my mom in nothing but a paper triangle thong! Not an experience to go through if you are at all body conscious! Not that the girls take the slightest bit of notice. You may well end up with wet hair (you can wash your hair if you need, but don't think there is an opportunity or facility to dry it), also, if you are like me and can't face the world without your lippy, take everything you need with you. Overall, I would certainly go again. Can't say how this compares to any other spa in Marrakesh, but certainly was as good as others I have been to."

After a shower you get your wonderful relaxing massage and at the end a nice mint tea with pastries. If you wish to do so youhave the possibility to buy some of the spa products. Simply amazing!"

The moment you walk in the door till the minute you leave, you'll truly understand the meaning of being pampered. My wife and I had a couples hamman and massage. Having never had a hamman before, really had no idea what to expect. Was initially a bit surprised to have someone put soap on me, and really had no idea what savon noir is. Once it was explained what was going on, and the process behind it, I wish i could have had one every day. The massage itself was more than spectacular. I wish the spas where I live had this level of skills and service. Our massage was 60min. My only recommendation is to get a massage for as long as you can find time for. 60min is just too short for such a wonderful massage."

Ask a local for directions for a few dirham - we were heading completely the wrong way until we did this!We opted for the Couples Evening Retreat, around 3 hours for about \u00a360 each. You can actually have it any time of the day - we changed the time of ours due to approaching thunderstorms!The spa is in a riad, and the way they structure their bookings makes it feel as tho you have the whole place to yourselves. It's very peaceful.I won't spoil it by going into details of the treatments, but suffice to say the quality of the surroundings, the products usednand the treatments was excellent. We were so relaxed afterwards it felt like such a treat. The whole experience was fabulous."

You have you very own little area so are not passing others on stairways and changing rooms and from the moment you arrive feel like you are the only ones in the place. Spa's back in the U.K could learn from here. 1 thing to be wary of thou is the 'helpful' man who will walk you there from the square nearby. He will take you straight there but he may not be happy with the 10dh you give him. He is harmless though."

I went to this spa along with my husband as part of the cooking & spa package offered by Faime de'pices - we were taken to the spa by the driver after the cooking course and it is in what basically looks like a back street off the souk, so very pleased someone was taking us! After knocking on a very inconspicuous door, we entered the most amazing spa. It's so sumptuous and luxurious, the girls look after you extremely well and you feel well and truly pamperred. The only thing to note is that you should be comfortable with a bit of nudity if you're going to this spa! Particularly the women. We were both given disposable underwear to wear, my husband was given boxer shorts which were fine, and I was given a disposable thong, which covered virtually nothing! You don't see anyone else, apart from the women who work at the spa and do your treatments, but it's still something which I'm sure could make someone feel uncomfortable. I'd read a couple of the reviews which mention this before going so I was prepared and to be honest you just need to relax and go with it. The treatments were fab, and the massage in particular was amazing. Highly recommended!"

We made an appointment at Mythic Oriental Spa by email from the USA as they came so highly recommended by other customers. We thought that pampering in some Oriental Spa should be an experience to try. Oh my were we right. The taxi dropped us as close as he could and then we walked a little narrow street until their discreet door. We rang the door bell and once a very nice lady opened we were in pure heaven for 2.5 hours. Our treatment for two was for 90 minutes but they allowed us so much time to rest and savor tea and pastries between each session that it lasted a lot longer. The decor is simply sumptuous, every detail is thought of. My eyes were in awe and I asked to meet the French owner to ask him where he purchased some of the decoration. Florent was very nice and gave me some addresses. His staff, all women, were very good masseuses and so genuinely nice that we will remember them forever. You \"must\" make it part of your Marrakech's experiences. The best spa experience we ever had."

We were offered refreshments on arrival and given a selection of scented oils to chose from for our massages.

After the hamman we were given time to bathe in a gorgeous room with lovely deep baths and relaxing music and more refreshments. Following this, we went to another area for our full body massage and then shown to another part of the Riad for mint tea and traditional sweet treats. What really stands out about this spa is the time you are given in each of the areas to relax. Some places feel rushed but here it feels like you are the only people in the spa that day and you are given so much time to enjoy the treatments for a truly relaxing experience. You are able to buy all the products used in the spa and these are perfect for gifts or to treat yourself and they are excellent value.The staff were incredible, very discrete but at the same time very attentive and every part of the experience was excellent - I cannot find even the tiniest fault with my experience here and would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to be pampered and treated like a prince/princess. A perfect way to relax and escape the wonderful madness of Marrakesh!!"

It's wonderful. Staff are friendly and attentive, it's clean, it's tidy, it's authentic. It's relaxing.The different rooms for the shower scrubs, hammams, mani/pedicures, massages, teas etc were all differently colour co-ordinated, and you seamlessly move through the premises and i was gobsmacked by every second. DEFINITE RECOMMENDATION; great value for money, so glad we found it!"

We both read the reviews and thought this sounded amazing, The reviews did state that us girls had to wear a disposable thong, which didnt really bother me until I saw it. It was a bit on the large side for me which meant it showed everything esp when wet. I also felt a bit uncomfortable when walking into one room to another with just this thong on. A towel wouldve been greatly appericated at this time. The room in which we had the Hamman wasnt very big but the treatments were good. Though I was asked at one point to wash my hair, which I really didnt see the point to this as I was then walking around with wet hair for the rest of the time, again maybe a towel to wrap my hair in wouldve helped. We was then asked to relax in a bath which to me was very cold so we ended up getting out ourselves but i guess with it being very hot at this time of year, this could be very welcoming for some people. My boyfriend really enjoyed the Hamman and im glad he did as it was his birthday, but I can honestly say it wouldve been better if I wore my bikini, I wouldnt have been so worried about trying to cover myself up and worrying about what was on show, and im sure I wouldve enjoyed this experience much more if I did wear it. It really did spoil this for me and I knew I spoilt it for my boyfriend. Im sure you can insist on wearing a bikini if you feel the same way as I did though the thong was ok when I had the massage, which I have to say, was the main reason I rated this experience excellent. Me and my boyfriend both thought it was the best massage we have ever had and we would def recommend going here just for that. It certainly relaxed me after the Hamman. I really dont want to put people off about the Hamman because I had one a couple of days before at our hotel (with my bikini on) and it was lovely. Maybe the thong wouldnt put many people off, but I def think it should be your personal choice to what you would like to wear. They say this package takes 2 and a half hours but we were there for 3 and a half so its def worth doing, they really do look after you here. Also sitting upstairs on the terrace afterward was a great way to end the whole experience."

The treatment consisted of a steam, ex-foliation, clay wrap, bath, massage and tea and lasted for over 3 hours. It was nice to do as a couple because you do get to spend a good amount of the time together.Best Points:1) Value - The price you pay for the number / quality of the treatments you get is very competitive.2) Service - All of the people working there are polite, friendly and helped us enjoy our time.3) The Massage - The massage was great and done in an air-conditioned and very relaxing room.Areas for Improvement:1) Explanation of the Day: It would have been nice to have the various activities explained in a bit more detail up front. That way we could have made some minor adjustments to timings for some of the activities (time in the bath was probably too long)Top Tips:1) Location: The spa is a bit difficult to find, make sure you have 20 Dhirams on you to ask someone to guide you there if you can't find it on your own. There are a few winding streets that you have to navigate.2) Wrap Beds: For the clay wrap we were put in different rooms one which had a massage table/bed, the other which is more like a tiled ledge. They put down towels etc on the tiled ledge, but make sure the person who is less concerned about a soft bed goes in that room."

Me and my boyfriend went here on our last day in Marrakech, which was a perfect way to finish the holiday and wind down from the hustle-bustle of the super busy medina!We opted for the Hamman, exfoliation and massage which was 750Dh each, which in relation to everything else in Marrakech was expensive, but 100% worth it :).You get robes to wear with disposable underware (which are quite revieling) and disposable boxers for the men. There is no disposable bikini top, so I wore my own, but soon took it off as I felt comfortable with the staff. The staff look pristine and smart and are very proffesional. Firstly your given mineral water with orange slices before being taken to a relaxing room where your feet and legs are massaged and cleansed (with is very very relaxing!! - im normally ticklish aswell!).Then your taken in a sort-of steam room. A lady comes in and washes your body with the traditional black soap and throws a bucket of warm water over you! Very exhilerating!!! You then get layed on a tiled slab and thoroughly exfoliated!! (including bum cheeks and boobs!!) This felt lovely! You then return to the steam room where the lady throws a bucket of hot water over you to rinse of and then you wash your hair and are left for the heat of the room to cleanse your skin. We were then both taken upstairs to a beautiful room which we could both have a massage in. We chose our oil, and the massage was superb!!! Very thorough, again, bums and boobs included!Once this was done, we were taken to a terrace and served mini cakes and mint tea! Delightful!The place was decorated so beautifully, and the experience couldn't have been better!My boyfriend would never normally enjoy this sort of thing, but he really managed to relax and enjoy the experience too!Would deffinately recommend!"

It was our first hammam experience, so we didn't know what to expect, but we enjoyed every minute of it.The spa building itself and all of the rooms were beautiful. The service was excellent from start to finish. Everything about our visit was exceeded our expectations and was better than most spa experiences I've had in Canada and the United States. The value was incredible as we would have paid at least twice as much for the same treatment back home.Unfortunately we visited towards the end of our stay in Marrakech. If possible, I definitely would have booked another visit. Our hammam and massage was a highlight of our time in Marrakech."

            "review": "Fantastic. As everyone else has said, this place is great. But I'd like to direct my review to all those men who are either too macho to go to a spa, or they don't understand the process and are hesitant to find out. Now if you're in the group that doesn't like the idea of having beautiful, young Morrocan girls rubbing oil on your body, you can quit reading now. Otherwise, listen up.I did the visit with my wife as part of the package deal with Faim d'Epices. We were greeted at the door by the hostess, who is absolutely perfect for the job. She speaks excellent English and makes you feel special from the start.Step one is the locker room. You are issued a bathrobe and disposable underwear. Since the staff is all female, and they aren't really interested in seeing more of you than necessary, the men's underwear is about like boxer shorts and a dark color. The women's version is about like a thong (no top) and is white, so it becomes transparent when it gets wet. I'm not sure why they even bother with it.Then you go to the Queen's Boudoir. Here you choose between three flavors of oil that they will use for the massage. I'm not really up on the various scents and couldn't much tell one from the other, but my wife liked having a choice. Next up is the foot washing and massage. You put each foot up in a young lady's lap and she washes it and gives it a massage. My feet are normally very ticklish, but they know what they're doing and it didn't tickle a bit.Next you're led to the hammam. This is like a small steam room, but not as hot as a typical steam room. Here a lady takes a bucket of water and washes you down with what they call black soap. I don't know where it got this name, as it wasn't black. I think it had olive oil in it. Anyway, she gives you a good washing and rinsing and you're ready for the next step.This is the exfoliation step. What this means is that you lie on a table and a lady puts on a mitten that must by covered with tacks and rubs you all over with it. When she finishes with you, you shouldn't need to scratch for a month. There were little bits of loose skin all over me. Then it's back to the hammam where you wash off again to get rid of all that skin that used to be attached to your body. Then you rest there a while and work up a bit of a sweat. Next you're led to a small room where you're given a towel to dry off and a dry set of underwear before it's off to the massage room. There I believe you're given a cup of tea before they start the massage.The massage therapists really know what they're doing. I don't know how it turns out that the most beautiful ladies in Morocco turn out to be employees at the same place. And how do they just happen to be massage therapists? But it's obvious that they aren't just here for their looks. They are professionals and I felt great during and after the massage. The final step is the tea room, where you relax and have another cup of tea. We weren't sure whether we were supposed to stay until they came back for us or just come out when we were ready. So we stayed a pretty long time, and even though we were the last customers of the evening, they never rushed us and we came out when we decided they weren't coming for us.After that it's back to the locker room to get dressed and try to figure out why they don't have one of these at home. So quit worrying about this being something that real men don't do. Make your wife promise not to tell the guys, so they won't give you the business when you get home. Or better yet, tell them to get to Marrakech and try it for themselves."

            "review": "Moroccan Angels!. We picked this spa to visit from the reviews here on tripadvisor, and were definitely not disappointed.On our first day in Marrakech, we ventured into the city to book appointments in the spa's we had pre-chosen which was quite hard work, as the taxi driver did not know how to get us to the spa we had chosen even though we had the name, address and had it marked on our map! He passed us on to a street cleaner who showed us round to the spa door, who we paid for the privilege. Apparently it was not enough to just pay the one guy, he wanted us to pay all his friends as well and it all got a little scary until the lovely receptionist from the Mythical Spa came out and saved us!We were taken into the lovely inside courtyard and offered a drink (well needed and they refused payment for it), while we looked at the brochure and chose our treatments. We booked in for the 'Mythic Spa Ritual' a 3hour experience for 1350dh for on our last day of our break. They did not want a deposit leaving but did say they it was cash only as they do not yet have a credit card machine.On the last day of our break, we packed, left the hotel, got in a taxi and went through the same ritual of the taxi driver not knowing where this address is and driving a really long way round (after the first day's taxi we found it much easier just to walk everywhere with our map, but we had luggage...). The taxi had to ask directions from someone on the street, let us out, then directed us into the souks and charged us the equivalent of fifteen quid for it! We knew it wasn't in the souks so headed in the other direction, couldn't work out where we were on the map and..........the next thing the lovely receptionist comes flying by on a scooter! Recognising us she escorted us to the spa door, (see, Moroccan angels!)The spa itself was amazing, so relaxing. We were the only two people there, and had a therapist each. We had a quick foot massage followed by a hamman. Me and my friend were together in the hamman, then into separate treatment rooms for our scrub, then back to the hamman, then into our separate rooms for our wrap. After being washed off (and cooling down!) we were upstairs into a candlelit treatment room for a full face massage and a full body massage, bliss!We then had mint tea while having a hand massage and manicure. My nails are in pretty rubbish condition and my therapist was a real perfectionist with them, they've been in much better condition since I came home!We found that the therapists struck the right balance between friendly, chatty and interactive while having treatments like the manicure but didn't hear a peep from them while doing the massage. Perfect!There is a clean shower, changing area and toilet and also secure lockers.The lovely receptionist then ordered us a private taxi (posh minibus) to the airport with price agreed (less than a tenner!). Perfect way to round off the holiday.Definitely take the time to find this place, it's well worth it. I know it's first on my list of things to do when I go back!"

This was a non-rushed relaxing experience where we were allowed to relax and linger with mint tea and Moroccan pastries after our treatments. They intentionally schedule treatments so you have the facility to yourself, for a singular experience that is uninterrupted by the arrival or departure of other clientel.

We were very lucky to be staying in a wonderful Riad (not listed on this site to review but called Riad Les Trois Mages), which turned out by chance to be less than a 2 minute walk from the Spa. The ladies in the spa were so welcoming, friendly and accommodating. We asked for the evening spa package for couples which is meant to last 2.5hrs but we were there for almost 3.5! Which was wonderful but ran a little into dinner plans! It worked out to be the equivalent of approximately \u00a360 each but for what you get it was well worth it. The only criticism is that there was a lot of waiting around, which, if you are tired and stressed out from shopping all day would be nothing to find fault with. You really will be treated like royalty and it is certainly a wonderful experience especially if you don't have long in Marrakech and want to experience a great hamman without shopping around."

My review is long overdue since I visited this Spa in mid-March after several days traveling thru the Atlas Mountains, obscure villages, and the desert. It was a much needed 'cleansing, relaxation' ritual that I longed for after arriving in Marrakech. The atmosphere of this spa is so exotic and sensual compared to the spas I've been to in resorts/hotels in N. America. The ladies who took turns with the baths, exfoliations, massages - were all professionals and very attentive to my personal preferences, including choosing the oils and music accompanying my massage. I was never rushed thru the rituals - I could have stayed longer than the 2 hours I was there and felt that they would not have minded. It was a wonderful, decadent and even indulgent experience - I came out of that beautiful place feeling light, relaxed, and ready to take on the rest of Morocco. I highly recommend this place for its great atmosphere and service - and yes, it may be hard to locate but some places are worth getting lost for..."

Staff are incredibly friendly and courteous. I wasn't thinking that it would be professional but it really felt like an all star treatment straight from the movies.We had the Grand Couple treatment that was supposed to be 2.5 hours but somehow we spent 4 hours!!! Yes, 4 hours of treatment and it never felt that the staff was rushing the treatments or pushing us out of the spa.I can't think of any negatives besides it was difficult to find but that was the same for ever other place in Marrakech. Prices are reasonable given how much we pay in the UK and US. Definitely recommend and if I ever go back to Marrakech I would for sure go back.If you do go, leave a fat tip because they really do deserve it."

You might, at one point, want to escape from the impressions/noises/millions of peoples of the Medina and then looking for a place to relax, a simple moment of privacy. We went there for my birthday - for a special treat. We had booked a 2.5h treatment with private Hamman, bath, massage. I believe we ended up spending 5h there and not regretting a single moment. The moment we entered, we were received from the 6 cheerful girls working there and treated like kings. We felt never rushed and sometimes wondered, if we were now left for 20min or 40min chilling in the bath...at the end, we were brougth to the Terrasse upstairs, chilling in the April Sun...when suddenly all the girls came upstairs to sing a \"happy birthday\" song for me and bringing a delicious cake. We were told that we should feel like home and that we can stay as long as we want...The Treatments were hihgly professional, the massage was superbe, the place wonderfully decorated and very clean. Clearly, it is not a bargain and you might find similiar things for less money - but hey, we believe it was 100% worth the spend! Going there, you know what you will get. And yes, we went also to a public Hamman [men & women separated] for 5-20D - but frankly, you cannot compare the two experiences...Tip: I dont know why, but Google Maps on my Iphone always directed me to a wrong place in the Medina when i typed in the exact address. Suggest you type in \"Rue el Gza\" or just go to the \"College Mohamed V\" and get picked up there."

My partner found this uncomfortable and a tad embarrasing, particularly when the first pair broke and had to be knotted by me!

Me and my partner went to the Mythic Oriental Spa as part of the deal they offer with the cooking class of L'atelier Faim d'Epices. We found it to be a good and enjoyable deal. We weren't able to do both activities on the same day as the cooking class was already booked of our preferred date but were nevertheless still able to use the deal and do the two activities on two separate days. Nice customer service there!The spa is great, we had a friendly welcome. There are lockers for your clothing and bags, and flip flops, a bathing gown, as well as disposable underwear are provided. This was our first time to any kind of spa so we had our swim wear with us as we didn't know what to expect. We preferred using our swim wear as the disposable underwear didn't fit that well (it was way too big for me - we had a laugh in the dressing rooms), but after the cleaning part you will have to take off your wet bikini bottom (or disposable underwear) anyway and you will be asked to put on a new dry disposable one before going to the massage room. So much for our preference for our own swimwear and we thus got over the fact that the disposable underwear wasn't exactly our size and continued the treatment with our new pair of 'hot knickers' - all part of the experience, er!? ;)The washing and scrubbing was nice and relaxing. I never went to a hammam before and the washing room wasn't super steamy (not sure if it is supposed to be?) but I thought it was fine (it was warm and pleasant enough).I was relieved to find out that it was just going to be me and my partner as I was afraid we would be separated at first, so I was happy that we could go through the treatment together. Just the scrubbing part was separate but that doesn't take too long anyway. The massage was the highlight for us both I think, very relaxing and calming. We got a mint tea afterwards, and we were told that we could relax a bit more on the roof terrace without a time limit. This I particularly liked about the place; we didn't feel rushed through the treatment at all. In fact, we were expecting to be in there for 1,5 hours, but in the end we were there for over an hour longer that that (including the shower and dressing time after the treatment). I read in other reviews that some people got a bit bothered by the chatting noises of their staff, so I paid extra attention to this during our time there, but thankfully I didn't hear much (if any noises) at all. + Beautiful hammam+ The private hammam deal is great for couples/friends+ Very friendly service: good welcome and we weren't rushed through the treatments+ Good scrub and very relaxing massage+ Get ready for sexy disposable knickers! ;)- Tricky to find; make sure you print the map of their website. We went there by cab but the cab can't drop you off in front of the place since it's in an alley so a map is useful."

It was simply amazing. I recieved so much information through the lovely lady who was in charge called Rihab through regular emails. She and her staff literally treat you like royalty. It all started off by walking in the middle of a wonderful traditional riad. We were served mint tea and pastries and taken to a room to change. My partner and I were taken to a room which chairs that looked like thrones. We were given hot water with lemon in it and were told to pick 2 products, 1 for the hammam and 1 for the bath. After that we were taken in a room and given a foot treatment which was great. We were then taken to the hammam where the 1st product was applied and then washed off in the traditional fashion many times. We were then taken to get a hot clay wrap which was different and had to lay there and relax for 20 minutes with relaxing lighting and music to sooth us. We were then taken back to the hammam to wash it off. After that we were taken to a room with 2 baths with our chosen product in it, candles, roses and romantic relaxing music playing. We lay there for 20 minutes sipping local fresh orange juice which was superb. After that we dried off and were taken upstairs where we had a 40 minutes massage. The girls do an amazing job from head to toe leaving you feeling like a new person. After that we were taken to a private room where we were served mint tea and pastries for a 2nd time. We were then taken to the rooftop, where we sat under a canope with a great view. The staff then came out, with a local lady and they all started singing happy birthday to my partner. They presented her with an amzing cake at no additional charge which made the day perfect. The whole experience was worth it at \u00a370 per person and me and my partner will one day return to this wonderful little gem among the hustle and bustle of marrakech."

The building, decor etc is stunning here, really set the mood for our early evening hamaam after our day of cooking and eating with Faim d'Epices. Michel brought us right into the spa so we had no problems finding it and when we were leaving after the staff did theire best to direct us back to somewhere from where we could find our way home.We were probably a bit naive and under-prepared for this, not knowing that we couldn't wear our bikinis like we had done for a similar activity in Granada, Spain, but thankfully we're good friends so we got past any awkwardness from the near-nakedness. However, as pointed out by another reviewer, the staff were young girls and were VERY giggly. Which I'm sure had nothing to do with us but nonetheless didn't help create a relaxing atmosphere. Again as pointed out by another reviewer, my friends exfoliating scrub was great, mine not so much. But by the time I got upstaits for the massage I didn't care cause it was wonderful and after almost falling asleep, we were taken for some mint tea and it was made clear to us that they were in no rush for us to leave.All in all a good evening well spent, just maybe a little more professionalism would have made us feel more comfortable and relaxed."

However, the massage was disappointing and the masseuse looked good but her massage techniques were poor. It also only lasted 15 to 20 minutes of a one and half hour package. Most of the time was spent waiting around and given tea! nice experience but not what i paid for. I think there are better places."

My partner is an exprerienced beauty therapist and was amazed and delighted with the service and experience of this amazing place. You actually can't believe this place from where the entrance is. Down a couple of narrow dingy alleways there's a pretty small door and in you step to the most incredible setting. Newly built by a young couple everything is spotlessly clean and beautiful. We arrived at the spa without a reservation as we went when browsing spa's on our mobiles while having lunch. Luckily this didn't matter as they slotted us in. We had the couples treatment which if your going with a partner is a 100% must. You change into robes and slippers and they also supply underwear for men and women. We got one of there best packages and spent the next 4 and a half hours in total ectasy. The Hammam experience was incredible and the girls that work there take such good care and attention to you. We had the full body and facial massage which was so good I fell asleep and woke up feeling amazing. My partner came out wishing she could have the experience every day as did I. Even though they over ran the treatment we had they in no way rushed or made any effort to change the experince. Just be sure to take cash as they didn't have a card machine. A truly wonderful spa ran by the kindest and lovely people. A real treat in marrakech!"

We had booked the Grand Evening Couples Ritual which included soaping and steaming, exfoliation, a wrap, steam and shower, gorgeous side by side baths with orange juice to drink, with the lights turned down and serene music playing - it was heaven... then we had a massage which was a little firmer than I'd have liked, but still very relaxing.

The Good: The spa was beautiful. Rooms were very nicely decorated, music was good, place was very clean. The massage was excellent, although I felt that it was a bit short. The oils smell great, and not too much oil was used on the body. The staff were very friendly too. The not so good: I felt the foot massage at the beginning was a bit too gentle (could be a personal preference). Throughout the hammam, the bath, the foot massage, we could also hear the staff chatting and laughing away, walking in and out of the rooms, closing doors; it really killed the whole relaxing experience for me.My scrub was also a let down, although my boyfriend got a very good scrub. For some strange reason his scrub took twice as long as mine. He probably got a better person to do his scrub than I did. =("

Rhiab got back to me straight away and booked us in for the next day and gave us excellent directions (it is sooo very difficult to find) When we arrived we were pampered to within an inch of our lives, 3 hours worth of treatments (Couples experience) which, as a spa junkie i can confirm was close to the best 3 hours of my life. The massage was especially fantastic. The staff were lovely, attentive but allowed you to relax. We spent the next few hours in the sun on the roof terrace with peppermint tea which just topped off the day. We were well looked after and if i could do it once a week ... i would. Ladies especially, i highly recommend you visit this spa, it will make your trip and send you home with a smile and your shoulders will be about 3 inches lower!

The Mythic Oriental Spa is a beautiful spa with traditional Moroccan d\u00e9cor combined with first class western-style service. This is not a traditional Hamman with impersonal service; it is a very high quality spa with international style service.We had a special Grand Couples Ritual that lasted over 3 hours and cost 900 Diram (\u00a370) each. This included and quick foot massage, Hamman, exfoliation, hot clay wrap and the massage to finish it off. To start you are taken to a nice and cosy seating area while they prepare your treatments. Here you can look at the treatments menu and decide what you want. Then you go into the private changing area which includes toilet, shower, lockers, hair dryer, sink with mirrors and individual changing cubicles. In my locker were disposable boxers, a nice robe and slippers. Everything was very private and very clean. Once changed, we were then escorted to an even nicer seating area and served water with orange. Here we were given the choice of oils to use for our various treatments.The treatments themselves are very nice and the treatment rooms even nicer. I was scrubbed, rubbed, soaked, rinsed, steamed, bathed in various kinds of ways before my relaxing massage.The final massage was in a beautifully decorated couples room with 2 massage tables and lovely his and hers thrones to sit on afterwards.After drinking our mint tea and eating our little pastries we were allowed to relax before getting changed.I would definitely recommend the Mythic Oriental Spa above the more traditional Hammans \u2013 you will be pampered and treated like royalty in beautiful surroundings."

We had some trouble locating the Spa but a quick e mail to the lovely Rihab (the Manager?) resulted in more precise directions. She even offered to come up to the main street (Riad Larousse) to find us! Quick tip .. on the Riad Larousse (the road) there is a Riad Larousse (a Riad) opposite the Riad there is a sign on the wall directing you to the Mythic Oriental Spa. Follow the alleyway for a few minutes and you will reach a large wooden door on the right. Anyway, the spa was everything we had hoped for. The building has been beautifully refurbished and is truly luxurious. The staff were very friendly and professional and the treatment (we had the 'Grand Evening Ritual' at midday) was sublime. The prices, although not cheap, are reasonable for the experience. Many thanks also to Rihab (the manager?) for rushing to the spa early the next morning to allow us to collect a bag we had left behind! Great experience - do go!"

We chose this spa because I preferred the treatments and liked the look of the place, as well as being able to book the 'Grand evening rituals' for couples. the booking process was through email, so simple and no deposit required.It's quite hard to find, but once you step into the Spa, its a lovely building, and the rooms are very nicely decorated. The owner of the spa was friendly and showed us where to get changed etc. The ladies who would be looking after us during the treatments were a bit giggly whilst showing us the oils that we could choose, but we put it down to them just being friendly! First we were taken into a room to have black soap put all over us, then its washed off, then we had the exfoliating scrub with a glove, which makes your skin lovely and smooth, then off to have a skin mask with morrocan mud, then thats washed off and you have a bath with whatever bath product you choose. The room has two baths so you get one each which was good. Lastly we had a massage, and after that mint tea with morrocan pastries. This spa is a bit more pricey that some others I looked at, but if you want to feel pampered and if you're a couple who wish to be together during the treatments, this is the one to go for. Just as a mention, I emailed the manager after the appointment as I think the mud wasn't suited to my skin and my husband's massage wasnt as relaxing as he hoped, and she did get back to me."

We decided to go to this spa after reading reviews on tripadvisor and chose it over Les bains which had been recommended to me. So glad we went with this especially as the reviews were so much better!The treatment we chose was the couples evening ritual (which we did in the day). This consisted of a hammam, exfoliating, a wrap, oriental bath and a massage. This package was amazing, felt like a million dollars afterwards. The staff were lovely and we were looked after throughout. If you go to Marrakech and want to escape the hustle and bustle than this is the place to go... a true gem! You won't be disappointed."

The only negative is that the first appointment for them in the day was late and thus it shifted everything forward. This resulted in our appointment running 45 minutes later (we had to wait this time in the beginning). It would have been nice to have been better informed about this when we checked in so that we were not waiting in our robes for a long time. We would have been happy to come back at a later time. The spa needs to find a better way to deal with late customers without interfering with other customers schedule."

I waw the last guest there but still they brought me mint tea and pastries and said relax as long as.After 4 hrs at the spa and being there alone i wasn,t looking forward to finding my way to hotel in dark but the owner and staff were great,the girls were going my way so asked if i,d like to use their cab with them,they even paid refusing my offer.The experience and smells in the spa were amazing,i can,t recommend this place highly enough . I can,t wait to use the patchouly body cream in its luxury pot when i get home,the smell will be a lovely reminder of the beautiful spa and it was a perfect treat after the cooking which is also a \"must do\".The owners and staff at both places were delightul and fun with very warm welcomes and should be very proud of what they have achieved here.Thank you i will be coming back with visitors for you.

The architecture and the detail to furnishing and finish of the building is superb. The calming atmosphere that comes not just from the surroundings you are in but also from all the staff that work there is unbelievable until you experience it for yourself.We chose the VIP treatment for couples and it was worth every Dirham and more. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We were washed, relaxed and massaged and received refreshments too. In fact we both loved it so much that we went back again the day before we left and it was every bit as good as the first time we visited.Visiting this spa has left us feeling rejuvenated and totally relaxed and was a perfect pinnacle to a lovely holiday. Would we go back again?? Oh YES!! Would we reccomend to others....It is a must if you visit Marrakech."

I was shocked to find out that this spa was only 4 months old and the staff worked so seamlessly you would think they have been doing this for many years.

I went with one of the girls I was on holiday with and our boyfriends had escorted us to the spa. Whilst we got ready in our bath robes the boys were treated to mint tea.We were spoilt rotten at the spa, it started off with a foot rub and then proceeded onto a steam (with some sort of clay rubbed on us not sure what it was). We were then washed in the shower, exfoliated, washed and steamed again, had a hamman wrap, we then soaked in the bath with roses, then we had a facial, a full body massage. To top all of that off we had a manicure and pedicure to finish off. We were meant to go to the roof terrace for a jaccuzzi but becuase we had just had our nails painted we didn't want to ruin them.When we had finished with all of our treatments the boys were waiting upstairs with a birthday cake that the spa had organised.They really went all out and spoilt me rotten.

It was difficult getting a weekend appointment which excited me even more! Rihab, the receptionist/owner, was very accommodating though, and responded promptly to my e-mails. I understood our tour guide's hesitation and warnings (about getting lost, being possibly harrased by men) when I got to the area but I still think he was just being cautious. (I had no bad experiences during this 1-week visit to Marrakech).Once you get in, though, it seems you are transported to an entirely different world. The silence, lighting, and luxurious curtains and fabrics instantly put you at ease. But I think there was nothing extraordinary about the massage technique itself except for the really liberal use of the oils. I suspect though, that the language barrier contributed to this feeling, as I couldn't entirely relax and had to keep guessing what was going to happen next each time the therapist left the room. Or because I have a regular masseuse back home who knows which parts needs massaging. Maybe if I wasn't rushing, and had an entire afternoon to savor the surroundings I would have enjoyed it more."

And, on top of that, there was a combo offer if combined with the cooking class at Faim d'Epices, which we also wanted to do... so we decided to go for it. But rhather than do the cooking and spa on the same day, we asked Michel (Faim d'Epices) and Florent ( Mythic Oriental Spa) if we could do the Spa the day after. No problem whatsoever for both gentleman, who both duly respond to their email requests in a very timely, professional and welcoming way.So having done the Cooking class the day before, which was amazing, we set out to find the Mythic Oriental Spa the following evening. It has to be said, be sure to have clear taxi instructions, as it is in the Medina, but a bit removed from the touristical center. All in all we had a bit of a hectic survival journey to get there, as our first taxi driver had the wrong address and dropped us somewhere totally not near yet.. long story short, we arrived, way too late and totally frazzled... but...then a world of bliss opened for us!Florent and his lovely wife were very welcoming and immediately eased our minds... we were swooped through a lovely passage way into the changing area, and then beckoned into the courtyard, over the water, into a beautifully welcoming reception area, where we were seated on trone's like a couple of pasha's. We felt right at home! We chose our aromotherapy scents, and were led into the hammam. All is just wonderful, everything very new, very stylish, the staff just lovely... and eventually a wind down with mibt tea and cookies on the roof top terrace.. Heaven!We wish Florent and his wife lots of success with their beautiful little venture!"

As of the moment you step in you get REAL value for your money. I first went to test because another hamman gave me poor resultat for my money, despite of the promesses. I went back for the full treatment programm what s a must-have-done event if you stay in Marrakech. The great, devoted staff was about 5 hours busy with us. I felt asleep differrent times during the treatments and HAD to relax after to wake up. I had that night a great sleep ...I ve visited in Belgian and worldwide different spa from small till would-be-top or fancy, but this is the F I R S T who has it all. Compare this SPA to a TOP 3 Michelin *** restaurant, or in car terms with a Mercedes S. Dare to search it, because Marrakech IS safe. And if you dont like to walk take for 20 or 30 dirham un petit taxi. Step into the Mytic world, close your eyes and let them bring you into heaven!

Starting with a refreshing drink and introduction / selection of massage oils, and then off for a quick change into some curious underwear before heading to start the Hammam. I won't spoil the experience, but without doubt it was the best way to end our trip in Morrocco. From start to end we loved this experience!

The products used are very high quality and our skin really did feel like the proverbial 'baby's bottom'. The owner is utterly charming and she and her team have dedicated themselves to ensuring the client has the best experience possible. Go and get yourself pampered!"

These two experiences really do go together. The Spa is a absolute haven of peace and relaxation within the medina in Marrakesh. It is a fabulous venue, which you enter through what what appears to be a non - descript back door in the medina! The staff are welcoming, gentle and make you feel entirely at ease. The place is extremely clean. My wife was somewhat reticent about strangers washing / massaging her body - but I can report that she loved it! We opted for the couples experience which meant we received our individual pampering, together throughout the Spa. The end of the experience, sitting and relaxing on the roof of the building (in seclusion) with a hot mint tea was brilliant. As it was dark when we finished it was particulary romantic on the roof sipping our tea and listening to the calls to prayer across the medina! This was a brilliant, relaxing experience which we would recommend to anyone visiting Marrakesh."

Mint tea and Moroccan biscuits served up on the roof terrance at sunset. No rush to leave.As always this Riad was hidden down a maze of alleyways and its door only hints at what lies behind....A taxi was even arranged (in a luxurious Mercedes for a little more than the standard taxi) for us.

Its certainly a large part of magic of Marrakech that a place such as this can exist in dusty side street in the Medina. The spa is set within a beautifully and newly refurbished Riad. The style is contemporary and very chic with clever design and perfect lighting and oriental touches. The spa was absolutely spotless throughout. My partner and I opted for a combination Hamman exfoliation and massage as a final day treat on our break in Marrakech. The two girls who undertook the treatments were highly professional and the pace was perfect as we were led between each treatment to a lovely rest area. Afterwards were left to relax on the roof terrace for as long as wanted.It was also nice to meet the owners who have gone to an enormous amount of effort to provide an unforgettable experience. The spa also has its own extensive range of exquisitely packaged spa products. Highly recommended experience."

The facilities are gorgeous, clean, well-maintained and extremely serene. The staff were all very warm and friendly and made us feel at home at all times.

Florent's wife spoke perfect English and we were offered drinks, and then waited for our treatments. I had a hamman and a massage. I was taken to a lovely steam room, washed and scrubbed with black soap, and then taken to another room where I was scrubbed down with an exfoliation glove. After that I was given a drink and taken to another lovely room where I had a massage. My wife had a massage and a pedicure and she said it was great. We have been to many spas but this was probably one of the best in terms of d\u00e9cor and service. It didn\u2019t beat my massage at the Grove, but was close! Check out the rosewater and argon oil too available for purchase. The reason there are not many reviews is due to the fact it is new but after trying to book for the next day we found out it was very popular already! Not to be missed!"

Having just returned from a week at the Pullman I wanted to share my experience.I had high hopes for this trip with my young family and some of the reviews that I read were very good.The plus points.The hotel is clean and the staff are amazing be it in the main restaurant, terrace bar area or the Pull boys (pool boys as they have a play with their name). The customer service team especially Yasmin was amazing and I will elaborate on this later.The restaurant is large and there are a lot of choices even for vegetarians which can be difficult.The facilities are good and cater for all whether it's a family or a couple.The not so good points and this is where the need to Pull their weight (pun intended).The staff although are great at times there are not enough to manage all the guests.At times when I called reception no one would answer the phone and also when I requested something it took 3 days of asking. I requested additional hangers on day 1 and they finally were delivered on day 3. The waiters around the pool area are not enough and if you sit at the far end of the pool you will not get served. Another guest informed me that he had to tip one if them and he came over regularly. This should not be the case. If you are at the Adult Zen pool you have to pay for your drinks as this bar is not part of the all inclusive which is annoying so to get the AI benefits you have to walk to the main pool.My wife and her cousin went for a spa treatment and this turned out to be not the gentle relaxing experience that they were hoping for. When Olga the Spa manager was told of this she became very aggressive and defensive and not customer friendly. She really needs to be sent on a training course. We refused to pay for the treatments.I would not class this hire as 5 star but at most 4 or a high 3.With the issues that we had I would like to thank Yasmin for all her help and support to make sure our trip with all the various issues was enjoyable. In addition in the restaurant Mariam, Mohamed were great and the following Pull Boys Yousef, Younes and Yassine were great.In life it's the small things which make a big difference and unfortunately Pullman Marrakech you failed in these."

We found that the medina was not going to work for us every day of our 8 day trip to Marrakech with our 3 daughters aged 6,4 and 2. It is too crazy and hectic. So on the 3rd day we googled hotel swimming pools that non-guests could use (27 degrees in December, oh yeah!) and found this place. For \u00a326 quid you get a very decent buffet breakfast, lunch, unlimited drinks, snacks, use of pool and facilities AND the most incredible hotel kids club we have ever seen. Donkeys, peacocks, goats and cows. Trampolines, go-carts, Wendy houses, arts and crafts and heaps more and a team of incredibly enthused and gifted 'carers.' Special shout out to Selwa, who also worked on the front desk, but for 2 of our 3 days looked after our 2 year old solely. The baby doesn't often bond easily but by lunch time of the first day she was running off and not looking back. Selwa looked after her so so well. It was the best decision to go there and we'd highly highly recommend it if you need a bit of r&r away from the hustle. Such a special team. Every single member of staff was friendly and attentive and helpful, and seemed to be very happy to work there. Sana in the restaurant also was incredibly sweet, remembering our names and returning lost property to us by the pool. "

If you're expecting 5* service then think again! It just doesn't happen there. The spa and gym doesn't open until 10am - if you're lucky. If you're just as lucky there might be someone at the spa reception - but don't expect a welcome or any interest - in fact it looked like we were interrupting what should have been a lazy day slouching on the reception sofa for the receptionist - she wasn't happy. Then we found the Jacuzzi - don't expect to be shown around. We were the only people in the spa apart from the receptionist and 2 other female masseuse - we walked in on them - one lying on one of the sofa's in a waiting area the other slouching over a treatment table - after a hard day's work? I fear not - this was at 10:30am. We were then told we could not use the Jacuzzi as we had to make a reservation - a reservation? We were the only people there! We also later found out that you have to pay to use the Jacuzzi! Spa advertised as 24hrs - open from 10am until 11pm \u2013 work that one out.If you want anything don't expect to be served - you have to go and get it yourself or go and ask someone. No one to greet us at the front door on arrival - the only one of the 5* hotels on the way including 4*s where this happened. We asked for a map of the enormous grounds at reception as the hotel advertises a jogging route - nice? Forget it - no map and no idea what jogging route we were on about.All inclusive? Expect to be tagged with an immovable plastic \u201cbracelet\u201d - shame they couldn't just give you an ID card. Coke Zero in a can - expect to pay - out of a bottle - part of all inclusive! Another nice touch is the opportunity of dinner in the Moroccan restaurant for those on all inclusive. What they don't tell you is the dinner is a limited version of the buffet restaurant - you don't get the choice of their full menu, although this is not advertised - we only found out by watching the only other table, which was sat on the opposite side of the restaurant, given their book of a full menu! If you\u2019re all inclusive, you will be made to feel as an unwanted guest as you\u2019re not paying the full menu prices. As all inclusive, you can only get a bottle of water at the pool bar or at the buffet restaurant, although all bars and restaurants serve the same bottled water, they will not serve you whilst you're wearing your tag!Great pool, you won't want to get out once you're in. If you're not fussed about which bed you have, fine. If you're choosy then it's a 6am start to beat the French! Giant umbrellas opened and closed by the pool attendant, when it's time to leave your umbrella will be closed unless you specifically ask. If you're looking for great service, fantastic facilities and a good standard of cleanliness then this is not the resort for you. We stayed for a week and there were only 2 staff that gave a decent level of service - Soufiane on reception (although there are no details shared or welcome pack to tell you about your stay) and Hassan in the buffet restaurant. Look out for the barman in the black shirt in Le Bar Ambiance (we didn\u2019t catch his name) can only be described as plain rude and extremely unhelpful. Our placemats were stained and unclean and the floor was rarely swept in the restaurant, we dropped some biscuit at dinner and it was still there the following breakfast, the staff would wipe any crumbs onto the floor with their hands and then reset the table, mostly with clean cutlery and glasses. The restaurant staff offer a miserable welcome, tea and coffee are only served when you chase, sometimes you just have to get it yourself and then it might be cold.It is very clear that the lack of care, etc., comes from the hotel management and spreads down to the rest of the staff. We made a complaint to the reception staff, the general manager was so concerned he sent his Quality Manager rather than himself. We were told that a contributory factor to the awful service was because we stayed during Ramadan, although this wasn\u2019t an excuse.The hotel and grounds are beautiful, but it is such a shame because the whole experience was ruined by the rude attitude and lack of service from the staff."

The hotel itself is very nice, very large areas and good comfy rooms with comfy bed. They also have a great kids room with many activities. The food in the main dining is good, though the breakfast selection is rather small especially if you stay for a long time. The staff in the F&B and some in the FO are not polite and sometimes even arrogant. most dont speak english and sometimes hard to explain what we want from them. i think the main dining room is understaffed as u cant even catch them to pour u a cup of coffee. Also, a big note to the HK department: please install a rubber wheels on the housekeeping trolleys, otherwise it sounds like we live next to the railway."

We waited for 5 minutes and decided to go look for them. They just pointed to another room with loungers where they gave us a quick 3 minute feet massage. Then left again without saying anything. After waiting 5 minutes - during which we could hear lots of noise behind heavy velvet curtains that kept moving - we asked what was happening and they said it was finished. -I reminded them that we had 1 hour massage and they said that it had indeed been an hour. We figured time had gone very fast. -They didn't point us to the showers or anywhere, so we asked where we could shower and they pointed in one direction without even offering towels. The shower was tiny and very uncomfortable, so we just removed the oil as best as we could, got our stuff and left. -Once we had left and checked the time, we realized it was just a few minutes past 8 pm. We should still have been on the massage table practically until that point! They just tricked us into paying more and giving us half of what we paid for.-We could have come back and demand a redo, but the facilities are smelly and not nice (I have no idea what reviewers who say this is luxurious are talking about). -Also, I could feel the nails of the person who did my massage, not scratching but very uncomfortable. My husband said he could feel the belly of the person who did the massage directly on him a few times during the massage. Overall, the massages were not good, doubt these people have any real training to know what they're doing.-Needless to say, NEVER coming back to this place."

They first led us to a small changing room with lockers where we changed into robes and then were led into a warm room with slab marble walls and benches and a tai head shower in the center. Here they scrubbed each of us with the black soap and then used the loofa glove to scrub the whole body. Then we rinsed under the rain head and had some buckets of warm water splashed on us. They leave you in the room for about 10 minutes following to relax in the warm and humid room. Following this you visit a relaxation room in your robes while they put lotion on and massage your feet. Then cold compresses on the eyes and forehead while you drink the hot mint tea. From here we were brought to a room for a couples side by side massage and following that we were treated to warm baths in huge soap stone tubs by candlelight with rose petals everywhere. While in the baths next to one another, they came in and performed facial and head massages with lotions. After a 1/2 soak in this warm room, we put our robes back on and were sat in the relaxation room one last time where we were given cold bottled water. An amazing treat for the senses over a period of two hours for about $80us - One tip bring bikini bottoms as you need to keep them on at all times."

We found the hammam itself hilarious, with buckets of water being chucked over us. It's true that the staff struggle to communicate but if I knew more French I am sure that wouldn't have been the case. We were left for quite a long time in the sauna part, and my daughter became a bit uncomfortable. Fortunately before we fainted, we were moved to the resting area. We were given a brief foot and face massage before we moved upstairs to the massage itself.The oil used was argan oil, which is actually unscented, so I wasn't surprised. I found the massage very good, and as strong as I requested. My only complaint would be that the masseuses did whisper to each other a lot at the start, which meant they weren't concentrating so much on the massages. However the rest of the massage was great.I thought 450dh pp perfectly reasonable for this lovely experience, and would recommend it for part of your Marrakech holiday. One word of warning ladies - unless told otherwise, your upper body will be scrubbed and rubbed. And I mean all of your upper body! :)"

Pluses:- nice 'Moroccan' look & feel- girls at the reception speak perfect English- good quality of cosmetics - massage (light rubbing rather then pressure one)minus:- expensive- rushed (felt little bit like on a 'factory line')- bathHamman:Lady who was putting the soap on us wasn't very communicative. She left us without a world and we stayed in the sauna for 15min without knowing what will happen next ans when. Later two other ladies came who gave us a proper scrub (if you want a gentle one you need to tell them first). Later we showered and were moved to the waiting areas for 10min and offered a tea. Bath:Then we went to the bath. 2 baths next to each other, rose petals everywhere - very romantic :) Which surprised me there were no oils or very little in the bath. I was expecting fusion of fragrance and smells but nothing like that. I was literally bath with water with petals. Water was very hot (I mean easily over 40C hot) and the room got very streamy very quickly and I simply couldn't breath. 15min in a lady came who gave us short head and face massage with oils which was very nice but didn't enjoy it that much struggling to breath in a very steamy room in hot bath. I had to get out to ask for water in the end.. My husband stayed bit longer so I guess it's a personal predisposition. After the bath we were taken to for the MassageWhich was the best part of the spa. Ladies were very diligent and didn't leave a part of my ski (ok maybe some;) which wasn't massaged with a thick oil. Again though no fragrance! No smell at all. After the massage we've been rushed to the changing room.All in all I was most disappointed int the bath. Why not put really nice smelly oils? Why not make it more entertaining and less hot? I might add that the bath is more expensive then the massage! All in all - not great value for money especially that we negotiated the prices down anyway."

I only became aware when she clipped away at a finger and it hurt so much that I realized she had clipped my nails and ripped off the edges till my flesh was exposed. I pointed it out and at that point I was so upset. Instead of apologizing, she rudely said she did her job and I didn't understand. I asked for the manager who very rudely in Arabic told me they were experts and I had no right to complain. The ordeal was awful and I ended up in tears and was made to pay for that service and received very rude remarks. I paid 1350 MAD to be treated badly. I highly discourage anyone from going and being Egyptian, this is a shame. I posted pictures with my blue nails before and then after. It isn't easy to see but more than a bad job and burning skin on my fingers, the treatment was awful."

The hammam was good, a little underwhelming, although I didn't know what to expect. It felt a bit rushed - I changed into bikini then went into a hot-ish room (it's not sauna temperatures) where the lady showered me and the rubbed the clay on. She literally spent 2 mins on the clay but they leave it in there so I put some more on while I waited. She then left for 10mins and then another lady came back to do the scrub and shower. It did feel a bit rushed in the hammam and the ladies didn't explain what was happening. I was fine with it but can feel a little confusing! Everything was really nice - mint tea, robes, friendly staff, an extra foot massage and relaxed atmosphere. At 450DH it wasn't too pricey for nearly two hours there but probably wouldn't pay more. It wasn't overwhelming but a nice thing to do while in Marrakech.I'd recommend going in earlier in the day before it gets busy!"

Then, scrub as, front and back, very hard, bit it feels great! It's like every dead skin is getting off your body.

Also, while we were left to relax, the women would come in and out, leaving the door open which allowed a lot of cold air to come in.

My friends and I were first time hamam goers, but we did do our homework beforehand. I would advise everyone to do some homework, so you know what you're in for. We opted for the Hamam, with clay body mask and foot soak. Couldn't fault their service at all, we walked out feeling clean and refreshed! FYI - They did tell us to take the top part of our bikinis off. Bottom intact though!"

            "review": "Disappointing!. My husband and I were away for the weekend - our first time away on our own since having children so we thought we'd treat ourselves to some pampering. Our Riad owner recommended this place so we were happy to try out her recommendation. As others have stated, we were handed grey (previously white) robes and slippers to match! We were then shown in to a small room to await our hammam. Not knowing what to expect I was a little uneasy and the woman assigned to us did little to put me at my ease. After declining to take my tankini top off she literally shoved her hand down my top rubbing the soap over my front - awarding me no dignity at all! She then left us for approx 15 minutes which was far from relaxing. On her return she scrubbed us down with a sandpaper mitt - I'm not convinced the mitt was clean. After having buckets of water thrown over us we were ushered in to the chill out area. The women constantly disturb the peace in the chill out area as they fetch drinks from the fridge - why they can't keep them somewhere else I don't know. The massage itself wasn't too bad although I did find my back massage was actually quite painful so I was relieved when she moved elsewhere. I wasn't allowed to keep my top on for this, I guess understandably but I have to say I felt a tad uncomfortable when she was massaging my front as she was a little heavy handed! Personally I wouldn't recommend this place at all and I wish we'd spent a little more time reading the reviews. However I would recommend experiencing a hammam but don't expect to leave with any dignity!"

We didn't want to go all the way to Morocco and not experience a spa, so on the recommendation of our Riad (Riad Romance) myself and my daughter were booked in for a one hour massage. The whole experience was wonderful. We had the massage together in the same room and the ladies were amazing and listened to what we asked for. The massage did indeed last 1 hour and beautiful soothing music wafted through the air by the end of the massage my daughter woke me up and told me that I had been snoring....that's how good it was!!The ladies then left us in the room for about 10 minutes, we weren't sure what was going on so we put our robes back on and got ready to go and get dressed, but no... they ushered us into a beautiful room with about 8 relaxing loungers, they sat us down and then bought us some delicious mint tea. That was amazing but it didn't stop there, after the tea another young lady came into the room and then procceded to massage our feet with warm scented oils. It was bliss. I would recommend the massage experience at Les Bains de l'Alhambra. It was fantastic."

            "review": "Disappointing . Visited this spa as a group of 7 ladies on recommendation from our Riad during a 3 night break in Marrakech. We arrived 30 minutes early thinking we might be able to relax & chill first but were told to come back at our allocated time. Fair enough. On returning I realised that they wouldn't have the space to put us anywhere. As a group of 7 we'd pre booked various different packages from their Duo Hammam & Massage selection. We were all ushered into two very small & cramped changing rooms to get changed into our bikini bottoms & robes - please note ladies, no tops allowed) - then taken to the mixed sex 'relaxation' area for mint tea. Then shortly after all ushered into the hammam steam room. Tops off sitting there with some people I hardly knew (it was a hen-break) was initially a bit uncomfortable but decided to just go with it and treat it as a laugh. However, this part of the experience felt like a bit of a production line, each of us having black soap slapped on, almost dragged under the shower to wash it off, told to put feet in mushy petal bath, face & body scrubbed with loofah mits, clay mask being put on face & body VERY sparingly (my legs had the tiniest amount put on them and it felt like the dregs from the pot, plus I'd thought that the clay mask was going to be part of the massage), lastly showered again before being given anybody's robes back (I had the bikini top of somebody else's in the pocket) and all between the door being repeatedly opened periodically for the two staff to come in and out whilst we're all sitting there semi-naked!! Hardly relaxing. Anyways, we then went back to the relaxation area for something cold on our face and a two minute foot rub. Could have really done with a bottle of water to cool down from the steam room but they don't sell any. 20 minutes or so later two of us were taken upstairs for our massage. The bed towels were wet (from the previous person?) and the head hole uncomfortable. The massage was good but the language barrier meant I couldn't explain to be gentle around my lower spine (I have a disc problem) so at times it was uncomfortable. I also felt there was a lack of discreetness when asked to turn on to back for front massage. Also was expecting to be asked if I wanted the relaxing/toning/draining massage as per the description but that didn't happen. Not sure if our visit was the advertised 1hr 45mins in total but it certainly didn't feel like a relaxing spa afternoon that I was hoping for. Also the head of our party ended up having a row with reception as we all were being charged the same (550 dirhams) even though we had prebooked 3 different packages at 450, 500 & 550 dirhams). Sadly, I think I've been spoilt by massages I've had in the UK & the Turkish hammam I've had previously as this was overall quite a disappointing experience and I wouldn't go back there or recommend it."

It seems really nice when you walk in, however we felt the whole experience was rushed, impersonal and not great quality. The hammam scrub was minimal and quick, and then we were whisked off to a room for a mint tea. I thoguht we might have time to relax here especially as someone put a wrap on our face, however we were there for about 2 mins - not even enough time to drink our small cup of mint tea! We were then whisked upstairs for a massage, although this was more like a body rub, as it was very tame. I got the impression that the masseurs were bored, and weren't really bothered about giving us a good massage. The whole experience was advertised to be 1 hr and 45 mins but we were in and out within 1 hr and 15 mins. An expensive and not great experience.."

Mine started at 5.00 in the evening, so if there was a conveyor belt of people it had died down when we (six of us) arrived. The towels were dry on the beds, but there were certainly people moving in and out of the relaxing area all the time. The ladies in charge of the hamman part really do scrub and it was a bit disconcerting having my swimming costume pulled right down, particularly as I was also with my son and son-in-law. However, it was very hot and clean and I really did feel like every impurity had left my body. The massage upstairs was very good and peaceful and professional and a good hour too. I would have gone again if I had time, but next time will come in an old bra, or bikini (not such a good look for someone of my age)."

Rushed up and downstairs by staff. Lukewarm bath, which my friend was convinced was previously used (slimey at the bottom). Given \"Moroccan \" massage.. Which appears to be just hard random rubbing ... Spent couple of minutes on one side then 10 minutes on the other and vice versa.. Utterly random technique.Pointless to point out the language communication barrier.. But unless you have excellent French or Arabic be prepared for zero corrections to the massage (I mention this because when you complain ..the receptionist will point out its all your fault for not correcting the girl during the treatments !!!) And any germophobes out there's? Towels used in communal areas are never changed whilst i was. waiting between treatments (20 minutes ) staff just tided towels and put them back damp Same with tea staff just collected glass refilled them with tea and gave them to next customer.At the end forced to wait for 15. Minutes until locker room was free to get my clothes approximately 10 other new clients entered and disrobed while existing customers just made to wait to \"escape\" hardly relaxing ...Oh and unbelievably there is only one toilet for the entire facility ...be prepared to queue..:-("

Throughout the whole thing my boyfriend and I were together which made for a better experience. The massage was amazing not a muscle left untouched! Be aware that when they say full body massage they mean front too (ladies no tops!) but it was all very relaxing and calm.

We chosed duo hammam and massage 1h45. The reception welcomed us and confirmed the treatment we wanted and then took us to the changing area. Inside the locker there is a bathrobe and slippers. We changed by keeping the underwear on as they do not provide disposal underwear.I chosed the package duo argile (body scrub, argil body wrap, footbath and massage). The body scrub of savon noir... Well i got impression that she has been tired may be or I do not feel that she likes what she is doing..., From a very quick application of the product until 5 minutes of very light skin rubbing. After that she applied the argile body wrap fastly and provide the foot bath inside the hammam and let us in the hammam for at least 20 minutes with that cold foot bath (I would prefer to have longer time in the body scrub). so the hammam experience was not really impressive except just waiting for so long inside the hammam until they took us to relaxation area providing mint tea And face compress, waiting for the massage therapist to be ready.Massage experience was the opposite of hammam experience..... It was excellent.... I asked for tonique massage and the therapist did really good massage and she put more focus on releasing the tension on my back with deep consistant pressure. The feet, head And the face massage was also very relaxing. Overall, The massage was tonic and at the same time very relaxing. Khadijah, my therapist was highly skilled and professional therapist. I have tried many massages in Bali, Thailand and India, but the massage at Alhamra was one of the best massages I ever had. I wish the body scrub and wrap was as good as the massage. Overall, all the staffs is very polite and very professional and the treatments are good value for money.Oh ya... Bring your second underwear if you do not want to go home with wet underwear."

Was a bit weary as there is a big warning message on TripAdvisor that the place is under investigation for fake reviews but I think it was really good experience and great value for money.We had the Duo Bath and Massage experience which worked out to 550 DHM each. It comprised of a (very) hot bath soak with Oranges, Bath Salts and Argan Oil where we had head and face massages. This was followed by a 1 hour full body massage which was so good that I nodded off for a while. Finally we had a foot massage which I wasn't expecting to be included in the package which was very nice.The is a very small piece of criticism that I would give. It would have been nice if there was some advice given when I booked as to what to wear and what to expect. To that effect, I think the below tips are useful, if you are doing the same experience:* Bring some spare dry underwear, or bring along and slip into swimming shorts/costume before you go for the treatments* I'm sure my wife would agree; Ladies, please leave inhibitions at home. you will be seen almost completely naked by your partner and the masseuse in the treatment rooms. Also, a full body massage means chest as well.It seemed quiet when we visited so didn't feel as rushed as some people say in their reviews. Would definitely and probably visit again if we travel to Marrakech again."

You are left to relax in the warming room - like a sauna- for periods before they enter back in to wash off the soap and wah your feet in rose petal water. You are then taken to a separate room to relax further, where you are given a foot and face massage and mint tea! Before you then head up for the massage in an upstairs room - having been my first ever massage it has certainly set the bar high!!

Room was warm but not steamy or anything. Had to stick my head out the door just to get attention of attendant! What the?.... Then almost on request I was given the Gommage for about 4 minutes. She then walked out again and returned with the mud mask. Applied. Told to put feet in rose water bath. Hmmmm I wander how many other feet had been in it already? Left alone again. Then attendant comes back about 10 mins later and washes my face and hair with shampoo. No conditioner or anything so of course it gets super tangled. Great. Hammam may be 45 mins but really its just an expensive couple of showers and an exfoliation with a mit. Right. Total time of hammam was really about 10 mins with the rest of the time waiting for the next bit. I was then led into a room with sofa beds. Start getting a foot rub and something cooling on my face - but sure enough just as it starts to improve im whipped upstairs for the massage. Good massage - relaxing - not strong at all. That was the best part about it all. Hammam aspect was a waste of time - wished id saved my money and just had a massage. Shame because its nearly the same price as much more upmarket places.

They did a quick 3 minutes then left us lying there for over 40 minutes. Honestly, I could have been lying by the side of the pool in our hotel- for free. I asked if they could do a bit more, which they did, this time quite hard, and they then threw hot water at me which they knew would sting.Then I had a 'massage' which was very weak. It was more like being rubbed with oil, rather than massaged. I politely asked if she could do it harder, twice, but she didn't respond.The changing room was cramped and uncomfortable. The shower was pathetic behind a plastic curtain.I actually left without paying the full amount, I was so disappointed. Of course they were annoyed and said they would ring our Riad, which they did- and had the nerve to ask the Riad to pay the difference! I suspect the Riad was getting a kick back for recommending them- so when the Riad owner told me this I told her not to pay it and they shouldn't be treating her recommendations this way.After this, I am now sceptical about taking a recommendation for anything from the Riad...as I suspect they have relationships with various companies and only recommend places which they get kick backs from.Marrakesh was disappointing in general, I had been there before twice and enjoyed it, but this time I found the constant haggling over prices and the rip off sellers in the souks exhausting. The taxi drivers were so difficult we decided to walk whenever we could. They attempted to charge us 5 times the going rate. The best way to deal with them is to ignore their price fixing suggestions, just get in, then hand them 10 DH when you get out. Never agree a rate, as it will always be way more than is fair.On top,of this, the men were gawping at my teenage daughter in her shorts. It was most uncomfortable, and I feel that the locals actually have no respect for tourists. They only tolerate us to get out money. There are lots of other warm countries to visit, and this one is dirty, unbelievably smelly and quite disgusting. I'm sorry to say, I've gone off Marrakesh and won't be returning."

This is a Ham-mam and Spa , but not like any you would have experienced in the UK .I would recommend it and it is worth every penny for the full body Massage.It is very traditional and run totally by women. The atmosphere is a bit confusing because not much English is spoken but the staff try to instruct you by pointing and smiling a lot.The mix of water bath and Red velvet curtains was a bit off putting but it felt very realistic in a Marrakesh type of way !"

I have to say I was quite reluctant to visit Les Bains de l'Alhambra after some of the reviews on here, however, I have to say I was very impressed by the service I received. It's placed in a very convenient location and is readily accessible; that was a relief, especially given the hustle and bustle of life in Marrakech. After we entered, we were warmly greeted and this hospitality was extended through the entire visit. The place is also very clean indeed, which is exactly what you want when spending time at a place such as this. The massage in particular was the one thing that stood out, although all the services I experienced were top notch overall. I'd definitely recommend Les Bains de l'Alhambra for anyone visiting Marrakech and I'll certainly be back in the not too distant future."

We were going to walk out but decided to stay. As we had our treatment the girls working there kept laughing and talking lto each other in Arabic with no interest of what they were doing. I had been to hammam before in marrakech and new this was not right. We complained and the end to the hammam and they apologised and advised they would speak to their boss to let them know. We also spoke to the riad who was very surprised of our feedback and called the owner himself to complain and we were offered to go back the next day for a complementary massage. Now this was a whole different experience! It was perfect! The massage was great and they were friendly and we truly relaxed! I would recommend this hammam but I would suggest to go during the day as in the evening it can get quite busy."

We were going to go to heritage spa before the recommendation and I wish I had now. Anyway, when we arrived I asked what the moroccan massage was like and the woman at front desk said it was a little rough but good for your muscles, this sounded like it was exactly what I needed so I went with it and my wife got a pregnancy massage, both 1 hour treatments. So we changed into the robes that were given which look like they never get washed. They started the massage and it was very very weak, I thought maybe they get into it after a while and start applying some pressure. So 30 minutes passed by and the ladies left the room for 10 minutes. Me and the wife were confused and thought it can't be finished can it? So they came back after 10 minutes and told us that the massage was over!! We were shocked!! They then took us into another room where we had tea and were given a 5 minute foot massage, they kept us in that room for about 20 minutes.At this point I realised this is what they meant by 1 hour.When we were done the woman at front desk asked how it was and I told her it was a weak massage and nothing like described. She said I should have told the masseuse to apply more pressure, I told her I thought it was going to be rough by what she said so I didn't think there was any need and plus the massage didn't last long. Anyway we left and it was a waste of 350 dirhams each! I wouldn't recommend going here even if it is recommended by someone as they are probably going to get a cut. I left feeling the same as when I went in with my aches and pains.....worst massage ever!!"

As recommended and booked for us by our Riad, we headed down for a hamman and massage duo. We changed in one of two small changing rooms then were sat in a hamman wet room, where a surprisingly strong lady doused us with hot water and covered us in black eucalyptus soap. Th scrubbing that ensued was vigorous and on the border of pain but our skin afterwards was smooth and ready for a Morrocco massage. Lovely touches of foot rub, hot stone face massage, and sweet mint tea in the waiting room between treatments. Only complaint would be a very noisy tour group in there at the same time as us - slightly spoilt the tranquil setting. But would highly recommend. Good value for money."

You are then moved to another area with long chairs to relax on and offered mint tea but before we got round to drink it we were asked to go to the hammam area. Nice, dark and relaxing. We felt the hammam was a bit rushed. Water was poured on us the black soap rubbed on us quickly and we were left to lie down for 10 mins. The girls returned and exfoliated our body with the gloves. That felt a bit rushed too but we felt very clean afterwards. Then again we moved back to rest on the long chairs for a few minutes and showed upstairs where we had the massage in the same room. My masseuse was good but hubby felt his did not put much pressure at all.The staff were lovely girls but the place is very busy and does not feel like a spa experience as such but very 'touristy and commercialised'. Nevertheless, we still enjoy the couple of hours we spent there and overall was a nice experience."

The place smells of lovely, healthy eucalyptus.I had the hammam + massage package with my friend. We were washed and scrubbed from head to toe by a staff member. Our hair was washed but with the oil from the massage later on it turned out to be for naught. Bring a bathing suit bottom. You will have buckets of water dumped on you. In the actual hammam (not too steamy, thank goodness), also enjoyed a foot soak in rose petal water and a foot massage. Afterwards, we went to another room where we had a quick mint tea, another foot massage, and some sort of cooling treatment on our faces (I think they just applied ice?).

After that we had more water thrown on us. Then we went to the massage portion of our day which was lovely but modesty is not an issue! While the experience was quite different and a bit shocking at times it was lovely and kind of fun to experience something out of the ordinary spa."

Visited this hammam for the duo hammam and full body massage - a total of 1 hour 45 mins and this includes a foot massage and cold stone facial costing 450 moroccan dirhams. Well worth the money.I went alone and was treated very well by the staff and was made to feel welcome. They spoke french, arabic and english and other languages im sure at request.The initial reception is very dark but this is not only tradional but it adds to the relaxing ambience which is nice.Mint tea and cold bottled water was avaliable as often as wanted and the staff were always around to assist you.It was quite busy but I didnt feel rushed and they gave plenty of time for each client. Belongings are safely stored in a locker and clean slippers and robes are given.Overall a lovely experience. Shukran"

As Morocco is Muslim, it was hard to find a place that could cater for men and women together. Les Bains de l'Alhambra can provide this service at request, it was another reason to book!The Spa is located near the Saadiene Tombs in an old building. It's small, neat and clean, very warm and comforting, where the staff look after you every step of the way. We were greeted at reception and taken to a room where we changed into bathrobes and slippers which were supplied. We went for Pack 3 which included a hammam, clay wrapping, foot bath, foot massage, rose petal bath with salts and aromatherapy oils, a head massage and a full body massage (that alone was one hour). The length of the whole pack was about three hours.It was a great spa experience, therapeutic, relaxing and a moment of calmness. Nothing like we have ever had before. My boyfriend and I left feeling recharged and uplifted.As advice, take a towel, soap and shampoo! This is my only negative piece of feedback about the place, there were no towels (we had to use the bathrobes to dry ourselves) or soap in the shower room at the end of the experience to get all the oil off. I would definitely go back there and try other treatments, if I ever were to go back to Marrakech. If only we could have this in the UK (and at the same price)!"

Big mistake. I was searching for my wallet and they urged me to hurry up. Not really the right thing to do in such a place....I was accompanied to the changing room, which is dirty and shabby. Then I was moved to another room, while the hammam got ready. The hammam did not look very clean and it's not steamy enough. There was noise outside in the corridor and I could not feel relaxed. Moreover, as the lady did not draw the scrubbing glove from a brand new bag in front of me as it is commonly done in other similar places, I have doubts it was new.After that I passed in the same large room as before for a very brief foot massage and then got accompanied in another room for the massage, which was too light. I got then accompanied again in the large room for a moment and then it was over, shorter than planned.I have enjoyed lots of massages in my life and I must say this one was one of the worst experiences I have ever had so far. I am sure there are much better options in Marrakech, avoid this place!"

Although there are tons of places to go I would not go to a place that hands out flyers on the street. Also a price lower than 400Dh for a whole session is not advisable. This place is in the Kasbah area off the main street. It may feel a bit intimidating to walk into an alleyway and ending up at a black closed door while locals gather around. But hey, that is a western eye. As soon as you are inside it smells and looks good. At first you have to get used to the dimmed lights. We booked a couples treatment; so everything is done at the same time. First we had a wash and scrub (the hammam), followed by a foot massage and then an hour long massage. Ah, how nice and how good! You feel totally relaxed. One thing to bear in mind; when you go into the hammam you are asked to leave on your underwear. Because you are showered and scrubbed this gets wet. So, take a dry pair of knickers with you."

We asked our Riad host, Yassine, to book us into Les Bains du Marrakech but they were fully booked all weekend so we came here purely by chance. Even though they had space for 3 of us to have two treatments each they were still very busy, as were most Spas by the sounds of it. We arrived, after walking up a side street and were led to the front door by a 'doorman' and shown inside. The friendly receptionist greeted us and knew immediately we had come from Riad Papillon. She went through the treatments with us to make sure we were getting what we wanted, took our payments and were then led off to a changing room. The Spa is very dark but also very pretty with rose petals and twinkly lights and soft music which created a nice calming atmosphere. I had a full facial which included a lovely foot and half a leg , hand and arm massage which I wasn't expecting but was all very nice. The therapist was very good and I felt very relaxed afterwards. This was followed by a manicure with hot wax. My sister also had a manicure and we were seated together near the reception area with a voile pulled across for privacy, which was quite nice as we could talk to each other while having our treatment. I had a French Manicure which I was very pleased with, although we did think it strange that they didn't put a base coat or a top coat on. Overall we were very pleased, found it cheaper that other Spas in the area and would return again without hesitation."

We were greeted with a cold and annoyed receptionist.After we were left to change into robes (room wasn't all that) and led to the hammam.The lady there was great and had a great treatment. Although other reviews were right when they say things have probably been used before. 1. Bowl of water for rose petal foot spa and the glove they scrub you withThen led to relaxation room for mint. Very nice although again the ice used is probably used on all as it's on a special deviseWe then went on for whole body massage which was lovely n peaceful but wasn't a proper massage. More a rub oil into the skin which was nice enough.After which we were left to go down n get changed. Sorry but this was not good. Shower was broken and a small liquid soap dispencer was meant to wash all the oil out, which it didn't. It was a corner cubicle with shower curtain n nothing much else. Ended with dissapointment.After that we waited for our taxi but as the place was shutting they asked us to wait outside.... Seriously? And so our 2 hour relaxation was a rushed 1.20 I guess as we had cone late (not our fault) and we left feeling a bit miffedGood enough but customer service front house is a bit to be desired"

I thought the place was beautiful and was lit with candals and rose petals - very beautiful. Between our haman and massage we were taken to a chill out area to relax and have mint tea, which was lovely. My only negative comment would be that once our massage was finished we were just shown to the changing area to change and leave. It would have been much nicer to be shown back to the chill out area to relax for say 10 - 15 mins on the beds before we had to change and leave. Overall very enjoyable."

I have been to various spas and have had different experiences. I went with a cousin and decided that we would pamper ourselves, we booked an appointment via email.On arrival it was looking as if things were going to plan, we had a \"bath\" treatment and a full body massage and pedicure booked. Quite expensive, but we were prepared to pay for the experience. The bath was great, then we were ushered into a treatment room where both of us had a massage simultaneously, except the therapists were talking and laughing the whole way through. Not only that, every time they were making a point/expressing themselves they would lift a hand, so it affected the massage. I tried to explain to them in English that we hadn't com eto listen to them, as it was far from relaxing. When we asked them to press more firmly, they just carried on as before. It was a waste of time I couldn't wait for it to be over. after about 40 mins, i asked the therapist to stop tallking, but they just mimed instead as we could feel the change in pressure ( sign-language) from the so -called massage. As we left the treatment room they asked us not to tell reception.. what? that they had ruined our experience???!!!When we finished ( the pedicure was rubbish too, they just filed our nails and painted them) the receptionist asked us what we thought, so we told them the truth. They called the therapists, spoke to them in Arabic, then insisted that we pay for half an hour of massage. We said that it was unsatisfactory and that we would have left if we knew we could. The manager was unhelpful and unprofessional. Instead she broke the cost of the treatments down into individual prices ( which is more expensive) and demanded that we pay for the two parts we had. She didn't even aplogise or attempt to negotiate an alternative treatment, customer service is not the focus... just harvesting the money from the tourists. If you want the personal touch, don't bother, as the \"relaxation room\" is like a dormitory/production line, where people wait in towelling robes (about 10 beds in a row) wondering when it is their turn. Unless you are fluent in Spanish/French, go somewhere else... Hammam Ziani.. better, cheaper, more authentic, a third of the price. ( maybe not decorated as splendidly... that didn't make up for the poor quality treatment)."

Again, there was only one lady (a differentone) working on us together, but it worked quite well on this occasion.She was very friendly, but I did feel as though we were on a conveyor beltbeing 'processed' at each stage.The final stage was the massage, which was very good and done by twodifferent ladies simultaneously. \u00a0My boyfriend v much enjoyed his massageand thought the pressure used was more than enough! \u00a0Once I relaxed theexperience was v much enjoyable and for 450DHS pp it is v affordable.Most importantly, this place was clean! The only downside is that the staff could have been more attentive to individual needs rather than 'process'everybody.Remember to take spare underwear with you!"

Since maps and street names are as useful as a boat in the desert, we failed to locate almost any of them, especially the ones hidden in the Medina among the labyrinth of souks. L'Alhambra is relatively simple to find, there are obvious signs on the main street from the Saadian Tombs in the Kasbah area, on the right hand side when walking southwards.Good English-speaking receptionist that took us through an online presentation. Since there was an in-house hammam at our riad, we just went for a 1-hour Moroccan Massage for the pair of us. 350dh each, totally off-limits to locals but still reasonable for Westerners.Our masseurs were young and polite, had a few minutes of quiet chatter and giggle between themselves at the beginning of the massage. I thought it was an okay massage, though we would prefer more pressure as opposed to a gentle rub of oils.The relaxing area was beautiful, we were served mint tea and a further 10min foot massage before we took our time to get dressed. The experience took 1.5hr altogether. I don't have another Moroccan spa to compare this to; I enjoyed it, didn't fall in love with it.http://londonwingz.blogspot.com/2011/05/charming-mess-in-marrakesh.html"

It was a nice experience - a calm oasis in the centre of a mad city - but disappointing on a couple of fronts - firstly I booked (and paid for) the Duo Clay, but never actaully received the clay wrap ( I only realised this later when my husband asked me whether I had enjoyed it!) and secondly because I felt a little bit like a piece of cattle being herded from one thing to the next - it would have been nice if someone at the beginning had explained what would happen at each point during my spa experience so I knew what to expect rather than just leaving me alone in the room or in the waiting area for 5-10 mins at a time (this happenned 5 times), without explaining why. On the whole it was nice, but next time I would try somewhere else. This was not a cheap experience and I believe there is better value and better service to be had elsewhere in Marrakech."

And you can also tell from the prices which are prohibitive for the locals. The hammam room is very tiny and the packages are organized in slots of 2 hours for each appointment.. After that, you are invited to pay and you get thrown out. In terms of quality of massages, out of the 7 of us who had one there, 3 had a good experience and 4 didn't enjoy it much. My massage was nothing special; also my masseuse was very young and kept using her left hand to send text messages from her mobile, while massaging my back with her other hand (!!??!!).

I go at least once a week for a massage or some face treatment in one of many London spas and beauty salons. And I would compare this place to the best places I have been to in London. Even thought it's in Kasbah which is not the most popular part of the city, this place is worth a visit. My hotel was in Hivernage and the cab costed only 30 dhs (2.35 pound) . It doesn't look luxury from outside but just wait until you enter it. The whole place is beautifully decorated, the relaxing area is amazing. I had a hammam, massage and a bath and then pedicure and manicure and I was very happy with all the treatments. I loved the massage, it was on a heated bed, took I think more than an hour and all my muscles felt really relaxed after it. I will definitely go there again when I'm visiting Marrakech next time."

Down the back, around past the local eateries and follow the alley would be about as useful as the map on their website! I can't help either as I've just tried to find it on Google Maps and drawn a blank. I think we followed Rue de La Kasbah south from the Saadian Tombs end and saw some signs on the right hand side of the street.We had the Hammam and Massage Duo as a couple (450DH each) and whilst it was a pleasant enough experience, neither of us would go back. My partner has had plenty of massages and been to day spas and the like but it was my first time so we had different expectations. The place seemed small and a little like a production line without being unpleasant. The staff were unfailingly polite and professional during the two hours we were inside the establishment.The gommage was 'interesting' in the same way that being set on fire might be interesting the first time. I am now of the firm belief that the body already has a well developed method for shedding itself of dead skin cells and needs absolutely no hurrying along through use of a mitten seemingly made of sandpaper. The cool bottle of water provided whilst in the warm and humid gommage room was an excellent touch. We then had a small cup of sweet mint tea whilst relaxing on a chair for about 5 minutes and a bit of a token foot massage.The final piece was an hour long massage. As this was new to me I guess it was OK. It was much gentler than expected and seemed to involve spreading oil over most of my body without targetting any muscle groups. The massage table was heated which was pleasant and the rubbing was soothing enough.Overall however, I'd much rather spend the same amount of money for 18 holes of golf. It would last twice as long and the walk would be just as relaxing."

The road to this Hamman and the doorman should have gave us the warning but anyway, we entered. The website tour presentation by the receptionist and the flyer looked beautifull so we booked the Hamman and one hour massage. The hygine was low, as we were lying in the relax room on towels that were wet, from the clients just before us. Also in the washing/scrubbing area you were supposed to put your feet in a bucket of water with rose leaves in there. It was around 7 in the evening, the water was icecold, and there were no rose leaves on the floor. This could only mean that they never changed the water and that X number of people before me sat on that same bench with their feet in that same water/bucket. When we were directed to the relaxing room again, we sat down and a hostess took an icecube out of the fridge to cool the face. When she finished cooling my face with that icecube, she opened the freezer again and putted it back, meaning..... (think about the bucket). The average age of the people that work there is 23 years so you hear them giggling all the time, like a schoolclass.. No suprise, the massage was an absolute dissapointment, very friendly girl (but everybody is friendly in Marrakesh) but it was not a massage, it was like putting oil on your skin and softly rubbing it in.... We paid 45 euro (which is a lot of money there) and I really felt scammed... If you would like to go to Spa, dont go to this one."

Antonia is very organized, and runs a tight ship at the spa - and I mean this in the very best way. We were offered mint water and mint tea both before and after our spa treatments, which was great...also unlimited delicious cookies while we waited for our massages after our hammam! :) We were able to choose from a whole bunch of massage oils for our massage, and were even sent home with soaps in the same scents we had chosen (a nice surprise!). The hammam was great...it was kinda nice to see all the gross, dead skin coming off you, leaving you baby soft afterwards ;) We were sent home with the exfoliating gloves that were used on us too..nice to know that fresh gloves are used on every person :)The massage was great...very relaxing, and the pressure was good The only con was that the ladies who scrubbed us down in the hammam, were rough when spraying us off, shooting the powerful water stream into my eyes. Although the roughness seems to be all part of the experience, it would be nice to have a little more gentleness / TLC Overall we had a lovely experience at this spa, and would recommend it to any of our friends and family!"

The experience starts with warm welcoming with a glass of tea and water in the small and beautiful reception area where I choose my oil and soap for hammam while nice lady explains the treatments I am going to have. They provide everything you need from the bathrobes to disposable underwear. Lady in hammam was nice and comforting. I even did not feel language barrier, the communication was easy and pleasant. After hammam I was accompanied to massage. The massage was just what I need. It seemed that the lady knew exactly what I need. I was so much relaxed and almost got asleep during massage. I highly recommend this place for the quality treatments and service they provide."

I came here with my friend to have a hammam and hot stone massage.We enjoyed the experience overall - the spa is lovely and smells great, and the women working there were very helpful.The hammam is a very bizarre experience but the ladies were very patient even with me giggling like a child! It leaves you feeling very fresh and clean and was very relaxing overall.Our issues were:- A man from the next door flat came in shouting about the noise from the spa during our massage which was very offputting! - We were initially asked what oil we would like for our massage but they then chose to use verbena (my least favourite) without telling us until I inquired after- We were almost overcharged - fortunately we had checked online before and knew it should be cheaper and queried it- The hot stones initially were too hot (sounds ridiculous, but one felt like it was scalding me) but improved"

We made a slight mistake on what we booked, but they made space for us where they could and we got the massages we wanted. Aside from a bit of a rookie error on our part involving argan oil and our eyes, the whole thing was very relaxing and left our skin feeling very smooth and new. The ladies who carried out our Hammam detox were lovely and made my girlfriend feel very comfortable, even when she was wearing the ridiculously small disposable pants and nothing else. Advise would be to leave make up and inhibitions at home."

We then had to lay and wait which seemed forever as it was so hot. They then came and rinsed us off with cold water. Very refreshing. Then came the scrubbing which was vigorous but not painful. I could not believe the amount of dead skin coming off !! Next was a mud mask applied to the whole body. You then laid there again for some time which again was hot ! Afterwards you were thoroughly rinsed off. Next came a wonderful shampoo and head massage. Wonderful. Once rinsed off you went all wrapped in a robe to a waiting area where you had mint tea and biscuits. Next our massage. I opted for a medium pressure. All over. Very professional. My partner and I were together the whole time apart from our massages. We were offered a shower but we preferred to leave our oils on. Easy to find if you follow guidance. Allow plenty of time.

All modesty must be done away with here as the cleansing process, which lasts about 30 minutes, is undertaken while wearing a one-size-fits-all very brief pair of disposable knickers. Once in my knickers, I was taken through to a small tiled steam room where I was instructed to lie on a wet marble slab. The attendant soaped, exfoliated (this is the part where all the dead skin cells are sloughed off with a rubber glove) and covered me with mud in succession. This was alternated with rinses between applications and time for soaking. The attendants were extremely efficient. No mucking around here and no time to dwell on the insufficiency of my itsy bitsy pair of knickers as the attendant prodded and pushed my body around the wet slippery slab. It was a bit like being a wet fish at an auction to be honest. The rubber glove bit felt really nice and with all this black stuff peeling off my body, if nothing else, it gave me confidence that at least I was going to stride out of there nothing less than clean. I followed this with a one hour full body massage. I have had lots of massages in my time and unfortunately, I didn't really like this one. Not completely sure why. Maybe wasn't much more than a body rub with oil. The other thing about the massage was that when it was over, I was given my robe back to go and get back into clothes despite being covered in oil. I felt uncomfortable getting back into my clothes with that much oil on me. A shower or at least a towel to wipe it off would have been good. I ended up using my robe as a towel. All in all, I loved the wash/cleanse in the steam room. Would return for this but not the massage."

The friendly receptionist made sure we were comfortable and explained all options in a very clear and precise manner.Up we went for the massage (we skipped the hammam because of some patches of burned skin due to the blazing sun a few days earlier) and enjoyed what can easily be described as one of the best massages we have ever had. For both me and my partner to acknowledge this is like finding needles in haystacks as we are incredibly critical being two certified masseurs ourselves.Heritage Spa hit a full homerun. The additional facial massage was also first class. We can not recommend this place more than we just did!"

The ambience is great, if that's what you're looking for. But after days of walking, I needed a real massage. Theres nothing more frustrating than being rubbed up and down, without any therapeutic pressure on areas that are dying for it. I had asked for extra hard massage, but got low to medium at best. Also, I got the one hour body massage, plus a half hour foot massage. I was out within 1 hour 20 minutes, and I had been left alone for at least 20 minutes - in the middle and in the end. Long enough at the end that I exited myself and asked if I was finished. This place is just to feel pampered and smell nice. But not worth it if you need a real massage. Especially if you regularly get massages at home."

It was literally a two minute walk away which was great when you feel all relaxed after.The lady at reception (I didn't catch her name) was really attentive and helpful. This place was beautiful set out with a traditional Moroccan theme.On arrival we were greeted and promptly taken to a cute seating area to relax and look at all the available oils for our massage and the scrubs for the hammam. We were offered mineral water and Moroccan tea.We were then taken up the the next floor to get changed into the disposable underwear and robes and slippers. The only bit I didn't like was the disposable underwear didn't leave much to the imagination but this is my personal preference and to be fair it is standard practice in all spas. Men however were given disposable shorts.Next was the hammam. We taken into a room and asked to lay down. First we were washed and then covered with a scrub, then left to relax for a few mins then it was time for the scrubbing, it's amazing to think how much dead skin you have on yourself lol.After that was washing, a hair wash and bit of a head massage then a clay mask was applied to the body and we were left to relax again before a final wash. All the ladies were fully professional even though it was a bit embarrassing for me but that's just me.After the hammam we were taken to a seating/relaxing area and greeted warmly by a lady who brought us mineral water and Moroccan tea as well as a few Moroccan sweets. At this point I felt so relaxed and clean I could have just slept.I also opted for a massage after which was great. It was an all round good experience."

I expected a relaxing spa like experience, but the application felt a bit rushed and the wash down a bit violent. The room was a bit small for 2 people and a bit noisy, but the mint tea and snack before and after the hammam was a nice touch. Our skin felt silky soft afterward. My massage was fabulous, however my fianc\u00e9 said his left a lot to be desired.

My partner and I visited the spa looking for an authentic Hamman - and we got it!We opted for the romance package, a 2hr 30m extravaganza of heat, water, oil, rubbing, scrubbing and relaxing. After a consultation on the oils and scrubs to be used, we were led to the changing rooms to start the experience. Now do not be fooled, the Hammam is not the relaxing part. For those who haven't had one, every intimate inch of you is washed and firmly scrubbed, whilst you are blasted with water an a hot sticky room. The amount of dirt that is removed by the course scrubbing mits is pretty scary ( we've committed to having one a week from now on!). From then, it was on to the massage. Whilst it was incredibly relaxing, it could have been a lot firmer (for both of us) and more focused on relieving individual areas of tension. Either way, it was relaxing and both the pedicure and foot massages were well executed. The facilities were clean and rooms were comfortable and calming. We paid around 1800 MAD for the treatments, which was reasonable - certainly compared to western standards.We would certainly recommend as a way to escape the hectic madness of the Medina for a few hours!"

The call to the spa was promising, as the lady spoke English and offered the first available time slot. We arrived 20 min before our allotted time of 7pm, as the website recommended arriving 15min prior. The lady explained that we would start at 7pm, and when we tried to inform her which facial we wanted from the menu, she just said something about it being about the type of skin we had. But the only assessment was what we thought our skin type was. So we had no choice of the type of treatment we wanted. We sat at the waiting area for another 20min until 7.10 or so. A guy came in and placed 3 cups of mint water, and 3 mint teas on the table with some cookies. Nice hospitality, but we didn't know if it was for the both of us or the group of 10 who were before us. So we hesitantly sipped the water and waited. I was asked if I wanted to get changed into their robes, but was then told that it was not their usual practice. After being ushered into the room, we were told to take off our tops. The therapist proceeded to slather different types of creams on my face. Cotton pads full of icy liquid were placed on my face, and the water kept dribbling into my ears. She tried to use tissue paper to pad my forehead to abort the liquid, which continued to dribble into my ears. Continuous pulls of tissue from the box right next to my left ear ensued for the next 45 min. I have fallen asleep during facials back home before, even during extractions. There were no extractions of course, just putting on a lot of different mystery creams. The clincher was when the therapist sealed my nostrils when placing the cream/mask! I could not breathe, and indicated so. She used a stick to scoop the mask, pushing it into both nostrils in the process. At the end, she slathered a thick cream onto my lips, which I wondered what it was. She then asked how the treatment was. And proceeded to PRY open my eyelids because I didn't open them. I had thought the treatment was still ongoing as my face was coated with oil and lips full of cream! My partner said his was average and he was not suffocated by cream, which is why I am giving it a 2-rating rather than a 1. "

After, we chose from different scented oils to moisturize with, while being served little pastries and pots of tea on a terrace lounge area, also with very charming traditional decor.

A couple of weeks down the line and our skin is still feelings the benefits!Some caveats for anyone considering booking a spa during your stay in Marrakech.1) This is not an experience for the body conscious! You are basically wearing nothing but a pair of paper pants and nothing much is left to the imagination. You might want to do some 'maintenance' before braving it - and I wouldn't recommend going with anyone that you don't want to see all of!2) Don't put the body oil on your face - specifically near your eyes. I I learned this the hard way!3) The best time for this experience is either at the end of the day or on a day when you are planning to chill out. Allow plenty of time to really soak up the benefits."

I was then led upstairs to change and put on a robe. I wasn't sure what to expect with the hammam but I am so glad I did it. They provide you with plenty of water and make sure to check in if you are too hot. I forget the name of the woman who did mine but she was lovely and I thoroughly enjoyed the scrub.

The price is incredible only \u00a368- in UK I would be paying over \u00a3280 for the same treatments! Upon arrival I was greeted with warmth, a smile with tea and cakes. The decor is very traditional which I loved. It was so clean and warm- lovely setting for a relaxing day.The Hamman scrub was great.

I went with my friend and they managed to do it in the same room which was nice as we shared the experience together.Between the hamman and the massage you have more tea and cakes and a little rest in a room filled with pillows - it was very cosy :)The full body massage was wonderful! One of the best massages I've ever had in my life!! The only thing I would say is the room could have been a little warmer.The facial was great, my skin was in pristine condition when I left. I would recommend this spa to anyone going to Marrakesh!We also got 15% off at Latitude restaurant. We went for dinner (they don't do lunch) and it was such a wonderful experience.

The spa is clean and safe, and the reception staff speak perfect English. We booked by email the day before for 4pm, but when we arrived they were confused and said that they were expecting us at 5pm. Nevertheless they took us straight in to get working on us. The hammam was just how I'd expected it- thorough scrubbing top to toe and a soothing mud mask afterwards. My husband doesn't like any sort of pampering so he tolerated most of it for my sake but did say he would go again. The 4 hand massage- omg!! Just wow! Ive had countless massages all over the world- Thailand, Bali, Malaysia, Dubai, India, etc and so I just thought I would indulge in one with 2 ladies working on me. They were so synchronised in the way they worked it felt as though it was just one person. I have never felt so relaxed in my life. It's a shame I don't remember their names :-(It was the little things that made this spa great- being given different options for the massage oils and hammam scrubs, being handed a small bottle of water whilst in the hammam as the steam can get a bit too much, the mint tea and pastries after the hammam, the full size boxer shorts for men and the shower caps for women, the complimentary Sens de Marrakech soap after our treatment etc. I purchased 7 bottles of their argan oil as it is by Le Sens de Marrakech- one of the purest argan oils you can purchase. It was 50 dirhams for 50ml, and when in the UK I have to import this brand from France which costs \u20ac42 plus postage for 100ml, so it was a real bargain!! Hadija at the front desk was so lovely- really genuinely nice! The only negative thing I can think of is that the time spent with the mud mask on in the hammam was quite a while and it was very hot. I enjoy things like steam rooms but as mentioned my husband does not and so he was keen to get a move on when I was happy relaxing! Also the same with the mint tea- he drank his quickly and then just wanted to get dressed but as the changing rooms were busy he had so sit and wait for a while. I was more than happy to enjoy the tranquility but if you're anything like my husband you might find it a bit too relaxed!I would 100% recommend this spa. Thank you ladies xx"

The spa is located in a house on a side street, with a nice vintage Maroccon vibe to it. I found a package combo I liked: The Heritage Beauty including the hammam, a massage and a facial. Every trip I go on, I do some kind of spa treatment because I enjoy them, I need them and it is always fun to combine a local treatment with some kind of \"normal\" spa treatment. The hammam lady was fierce, she scrubbed so much skin off my body I was in awe (I do scrubs myself and I had had one a few days before) that I had any left when she was done. (You get your used scrub glove as a present, but I did not want it...), 45 minutes later I had some mint tea while waiting for my massage, which was fine, done in a dark room with light music playing. I told the lady I wanted more pressure which I got. Lastly the facial, which was divine. I'm used to the therapists telling you with a light touch or voice when something ends or starts, but the communication was kept to a low. They kind of turned on/off the lights and went out and I thought OK are we done now? But all the staff were sweet and professional and I would recommend this spa, because it was clean, had nice professional staff and it was just a great experience which left me smiling."

First of all the place is perfectly clean.. That's a top priority for me and it exceeded my standards. The hammam was the best I had in all of Morocco. The woman was so incredibly thorough, professional and accommodating. I have a very large scar on my leg and she took special care to treat it and not apply too much pressure while scrubbing. The facial was also amazing. Better than most I've had in the USA. I literally walked out of there glowing. Most relaxing day of my life."

I would advise booking at least the day before. You could get lucky like we did though. We had the heritage beauty package which consisted of a hamman, full body massage and facial lasting 2\u00bd hours for 950Dhs. The hamman was hot! The massage was better than any I have had in the UK and was from top to toe. The facial I think was good but I must admit I fell asleep. Would definitely recommend. The disposable underwear was lacking somewhat though. Pretty much just a see-through thong! Nothing left to the imagination. "

The experience of a hammem is a brilliant one, so if you are even considering it then give it a go and do so at Heritage Spa! I have never felt so clean and it was a great way to end our holiday. The massage was the best myself or my husband have ever had and the gifts and discount they offer for a meal at Latitude 31 (also well worth a visit) was a nice touch. Book in advance, a day or so should be enough. We found the spa easy to find and would recommend it to anyone. We went for the hammam and massage combo which at 650 dir was really reasonably priced, we were there 2 hours and had tea served and a nice relax afterwards."

It is tucked away and can be hard to find, but we were staying locally and popped in to make our appointment in person so had found it a couple of days before. It is very professionally run and you are treated very well - as others have said \"mint tea\" upon arrival and taken to a little area where you can choose your oils and lotions. Not alot of time was given for you to make your decision (I also noticed this at the end when I was waiting for my husband and saw two other couples also brought in, given refreshments but then \"rushed\" to choose their oils). We were then taken upstairs and shown the changing area and lockers. We had booked the \"romantic package\" of hamman, massage, one facial and one foot treatmmen. I assumed the massage would be done together in the same room (as I have experienced in other locations around the world). Unfortunately the treatments were not explained to us before and I didn't want to go into the hamman as I suffer from asthma and couldn't breathe properly when they opened the door. So my husband went in and I was taken for my massage. Subsequently I finished an hour earlier than my husband, but I was shown back to the changing room and then taken back to the lounge area where I was given mint tea, water and biscuits (which was lovely). Personally I didn't enjoy my massage and was very disappinted with the foot treatment as I thought I'd get a proper pedicure with removal of hard skin, nails polished etc - and this didn't happen. My husband enjoyed the hamman best, however he has had a rash all over his chest and back since then so he's obviously had a reaction to the treatment. So in summary, it's a relaxing spa where you are treated well, but I would suggest checking what you are booking and what will happen during each treatment so you are prepared in advance."

Then we relaxed for about 20 mins wrapped in robes and drank mint tea & nibbled sesame/peanut biscuits & drank water. Then with the oil of your choice a blissful 1 hr massage.

Just one thing to note...they ask if there are any areas you don't want massaged...my female friend got a shock when her breasts were massaged!

There was little technique and and undue amount of time was spent massaging the feet. I did however tell the masseuse what to do and she did change track. I am completely preplexed by all the reviews - as it was not luxurious or even good as what other people are saying.

            "review": "Good hammam, but very average massage & facial. We booked the Romance package which is for couples to go through their hammam and massage together, followed by foot massage for one and facial for the other; very untraditional but we felt like spending to spoil ourselves. I booked via email many weeks prior and paid a \u20ac50 deposit and had over 10 email exchanges with them asking questions. They were very efficient and always responded quickly. However despite emailing them again just 2 days prior to our booking, they were very surprised to see us at their door when we arrived and they didn't seem to be expecting us at all. I had to tell them repeatedly what I booked and who I was. I also had to tell them I had paid a deposit and how much it was!Once we were settled in the waiting room with tea (we arrived a bit early), someone came and explained the process and showed us the oils etc and wrote down which oils we chose and what type of massage we wanted and any injuries that would affect the massage. It all seemed quite efficient however, when it came time for the massage, it was obvious that none of this information was passed on because we were both asked the same questions again with the exception of what injuries as that didn't seem important now! The hammam was great. We were in together, being soaked and scrubbed and washed down. Loved every minute. The women doing our hammam were really great and worked hard for their money and we tipped them generously (well I hope the tip made it back to them). After the hammam we sat and were given tea and cookies by a man who clearly and openly made fun of me when I answered his French with 'sorry only English'. He continued to make fun of this in a very condescending way despite me being nothing but polite and humble and my usual smiling self. From here we were directed downstairs for our massage and we were put in separate rooms. I would have liked to stay together as I thought was the plan for this package. The girl who directed us to the massage rooms had no idea what package or massage we were there for and she actually asked me if I was having the 'four hands massage'..... this was disappointing and I had to wonder if she was supposed to get the other couple who were waiting in the salon with us.Once in, she asked me what oil and what type of massage I like, despite having given this information earlier. And despite opting for the very firm, very strong massage, she gave me a mostly very soft massage. My spouse had exactly the same experience according to him. After the massage my spouse had to walk back upstairs for his foot massage, which he said was average but better than the body massage. He said he would have much preferred to stay where he was for the foot massage, being rather sleepy from the massage already. I stayed where I was for my facial, which took I think nearly an hour because I'm pretty sure i was forgotten for about 30 minutes. There was one part of the facial process where I was left for far too long and I actually spent a good part of it wondering if I should get up and look for the girl! After she came back, the rest of the facial went smoothly and was quite nice but far too long.I was then directed upstairs to meet my spouse who'd been waiting for some time for me (with tea). As soon as I met him, we were directed to get changed and leave. No chance for me to sit awhile and wake up which was what I really needed.We also both found that having to wear cold, wet slippers and a damp to wet robe around the building, upstairs and downstairs, was annoying and cold and therefore hard to relax and took away from the experience a great deal. The lack of communication about our package between staff was disappointing and annoying. We visit spas quite a bit all over the world and we know not to expect a therapeutic type massage from a day spa, but the experience we paid highly for here at the Heritage Spa was just plain average and not worth it.Even paying the balance was interesting as the same man who had served our tea and who I felt was totally condescending toward me, stood over the girl at the counter with pretty obvious distaste toward us and such a bad vibe that frankly i couldn't wait to get out the door. Overall, this is a very expensive package for a pretty average experience. I would recommend the hammam only. The hamman is the only reason I have given a 3 star rating. If we didn't have the hammam my rating would be less."

Ever.Romance package was stunning value. \u00a355 (per person) for hour long hammam (lay on a hot marble slab, divine in itself, and be slathered in soap, showered, scrubbed, showered, mudpack, showered, the best hair wash ever, showered) and then back into your fluffy robe. Quick mint tea then both whisked into massage room for the greatest massage of my life and I've had a fair few. Then end with either a facial or foot massage. Let the boy have the facial and so she offered me a pedi instead of the foot massage, as per the deal. Was such a lovely experience from start to finish, all for the price of a facial in london!One thing to note: the quoted timeFor the romance package is 2.5 hours. By time you have arrived, had a glass of mint tea, chosen your oils, then glasses of mint tea given between each pamper session, it's closer to a 3.5 hour experience. Pure bliss!A delish Falafel and harrisa sandwich in the henna cafe just 1 min walk away was the perfect way to finish."

We then changed into paper knickers and was led to a hot room where we laid down and was scrubbed and covered in black soap. It was amazing after being scrubbed a few times we were give drinks a relaxed before being led to the massage. I had a full body and a facial my husband had foot massage and a full body.

            "review": "Only go for the Hammam.. My wife and I booked a Hamman plus massage package. It costs 650 dirhams per pax and the total duration was approximately 1 hour and 45 mins. The spa comes highly rated, as you can tell from the reviews online and the expectations were high. Perhaps that's why I only rate it 3 stars. The Hammam was good and the amount of dead skin that is rubbed out is alarming. You do feel great after the Hammam and the lady holds you and guides you out as you can get a little light headed (in a good way!). The Moroccans do it once a week or fortnight and it is integral to their culture. After the good scrubbing session, we were still in our wet underpants and hair and directed to the massage bed. The massage was average at best. The ones we get in Bali, Bangkok etc are way better and it does not appear that the massage is any different from the ones we get anywhere in the world (unlike the Hammam). I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not great, not by a country mile. So we look at the price, it's considered steep in Moroccan terms. you are looking at approximately \u00a345. I'm just not sure it's worth it. There again, the Hammam was a great experience, but I'm sure you can ask your Riad manager to introduce you to one that is just as good without paying #1 tripadvisor price."

The place was very clean with fresh towels and clean, white robes and slippers. Paper pants were provided (very stylish black boxers for him and highwaisted thong for me--think 1980s). The two ladies doing the hammam were very friendly and smiled and laughed with us as we attempted to relax whilst being soaped, scrubbed enthusiastically and covered in clay ALL over. After more tea, then a massage. I asked for med-firm pressure which was perfect. Overall a unique experience and a relaxing afternoon. We were given a scented soap of our choice each to take home which was a nice touch. Hammam and massage took approximately 2 hours--a nice break from the hubbub of activity in Marrakech.

For the first one I didn't put any comment on TA as the experience was alright but not amazing in comparison with the many other Spa I tried in Marrakech and I didn't really want to bother writing a \"normal\" comment.But for that one I had to write something as what I experienced was far under the standards of any spa I tried in Marrakech(and I am a local so I really know what I am talking about here). Basically, the only positive things about this experience is the friendliness of the staff and I am talking here about the scrub and massage ladies. What I really was annoyed about is the non professionalism of the Owner of the property. Basically when we arrived we sat at the reception to have a cup of tea and I received a call from the nanny of my 3 years old kind that I needed to take (we never know what can happen with kids!), I exchanged few words with her until the owner came and told me to shut up because some people were having massage not far form the reception area.. My friend and I were literally shocked with his attitude, I didn't even had to chance to finish my call and just hang out on the nanny as I was scared he will kick me out from the spa ! This really has put me in a very bad mood to start what should be a relaxing experience. Anyway, after that we went to get changed in a \"dirty\" changing room that was to us more like a furniture storage. Sleepers provided were dirty (even wet!), not the right size I preferred to walk without... "

This was without a doubt the best spa experience I have ever had, and that is not a small measure for me, I've spent thousands in a single day at fancy spas around the world, nothing comes close to the few hundred dollars I spent for 4 HOURS+ of absolute excellence here. The ambience is excellent, TONS of beautiful features and details everywhere. We were picked up and guided to the spa from across the Medina for free which is really hard to find anything in Marrakech for free! Upon arrival we were greeted by Ali and sat down with tea to personally discuss every little bit of what we expected from each portion of the package. This was absolutely custom tailored for us, and the VALUE IS UNBELIEVABLE. We thoroughly enjoyed the Hamam, massages, snacks, scrubs, pedicure etc. (And we are both bodyworkers ourselves with thousands of hours of training and experience so we know what good therapy looks/feels like!) There are plenty of Hammams in Marrakech that offer a third of the time/treatments and expect 1000 MAD more for their packages. I scoured every hammam and personally I think this is the best value in Marrakech, and as I said previously, quite possibly the BEST VALUE SPA EXPERIENCE TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE!Thank You Ali,I'll be back in 4 days for more!"

As my wife was pregnant Antonina (manager) created a bespoke package for her where she had a carina Paris pedicure rather than a hamam scrub. We both had our massage together and I asked for my massage to be hard as I feel that soft massages don't do much for me. I saw the masseuse and though oh great here comes another soft massage... How wrong i was. My shoulders back and calves all had many nots in them and this lady removed them that were supported my loud groans. My wife thought I was being beaten/burned/both. At the end I felt like a new man. Will most definitely be coming here again as I feel insanely relaxed and ready to take on the world again."

Hamam, soaps, scrubs, massages... All great. The facial treatment wasn't quite my thing, it would be cool if the girls could chose between facial treatment and foot massage too. My partner said his massage was great, the foot massage could have been better. In the end you get a soap and the scrub gloves to rake home. All in all a worth whole thing!"

We did quite a bit of research and chose the heritage spa based on location and the packages they offered. We went for the 1h45m hamman and massage package. The service was welcoming from the front desk, but after that, there wasnt really any welcoming customer service. The hamman was good and thorough but the massage must have been one of the best massages I have ever had. We were warned that the strength would be poor due to it being ramadan, but I did not expect how poor it could be. Might as well have not had it at all. It was more stroking than massage. The head massage was just stroking of the hair. It just felt like they were not putting any effort into it at all which frustrated me. When my friend had her foot massage (possibly same lady) she had her eyes covered and had thought the masseur had fallen asleep! It is cheaper than the UK but still pricey so really do expect better service than what we received. Also, our massages were noway near 1 hour long which was what we were expecting. I would choose somewhere else for sure next time."

Despite having to strip down to basically nothing (in privacy) in the company of our group, we were made to feel comfortable and safe and were very well looked after by the more than capable ladies working at the spa. We started with a hot steam type room to warm our bodies and sweat out the toxins, then two lovely ladies proceeded to wash, oil and scrub the 3 of us individually until our skin was smooth and soft. We also got a clay body masque and hair wash and rinse then we were ushered into a lovely sitting room for tea and water to relax in dressing gowns before our massages. We were able to choose our massage oils from 6 aromatic options, and our scrub from 2 options. We could also choose the strength of the massage. Despite the confrontation of having to be nearly naked in front of the ladies working there and our group of friends we were with, the whole experience was lovely and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great way to spend a few hours out of the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. The place itself was beautiful, had a lovely smell and relaxing vibe. Thank you as well for the complimentary soaps following our visit."

I went with my partner who had a hammam and massage while I had a massage and pedicure. We had been to the other highly rated hammam (Rosa bon heure) a few days earlier and so had experience of a Moroccan hammam. After our greeting the experience at Heritage rapidly declined. The staff were curt and not at all friendly or attentive. This did not feel like a quality establishment despite the hefty charge. My boyfriend wasn't offered any showering facility after his massage and travelled home oily, which is unpleasant in the heat. The massage was also less complete than at Rosa bon Heure. This place really doesn't deserve the rating it holds. Take my advice and go to Rosa bon Heure. You'll have a much better experience for less money. Cannot recommend at all."

Follow the signs. Lovely structure, professional treatments, nice touches all around. Worth every dirham (only a third to half of what it would cost in the US or Europe)"

My partner and I booked the Heritage romance package for two people which included a hammam, full body massage, foot massage for him and facial for me. Everything about this place was wonderful. The place itself is clean and beautifully decorated , the people were wonderful, courteous and friendly and the treatments were first class.We were seated in a cosy and beautifully decorated waiting area and asked to smell various oils and decide which one we wanted for our massage. We were also asked to do the same for the cleansing soaps for the first part of the hammam. We started off with the hammam which was far superior to any other hammam I've had. The ladies were professional and with a sense of humour! It was all done very thoroughly and not in a half hearted manner as I've experienced in the past at other places. I really felt squeaky clean afterwards!After the hammam we sat for 10 minutes or so in a chill out area and were served mint tea, mint water and biscuits. Again this area was beautifully decorated and was truly relaxing.Next we had a massage in two rooms with an interconnecting door which could be open or closed as you wished. I'd asked for a strong massage and I can honestly say that it was the best massage I've ever had. The woman's hands were like silk! she was obviously very experienced. Everything about it was perfect, the pressure, the temperature in the room, the length of the massage and the general ambience. Finally I had my facial which was also very good and thorough. I'm not always a great fan of facials as I often think that they can either be too hurried or you're waiting around too long in between applications. Again, all the products were applied with care and skill. It really was worth every penny and a wonderful indulgence from start to finish. It was 2 and a half hours of pure bliss. You even get a discount if you then book a meal at Latitude31 which I can also highly recommend."

I've been to various massages in Thailand, UK and Poland and have to say this was by far the most relaxing and pleasant massage I ever had.

Nervous husband seemed relieved we were together for this experience, he started to relax towards the end. Never have we felt so clean after being washed and scrubbed at least four times!! Hammam ladies always checking we were ok. Nice relaxing post hamman break with tea/water and biscuits before being led (separately) into our respective massage rooms for an hour of complete bliss.

I prebooked a hammam and massage for my partner and I and paid a small deposit in advance. We used google maps to find the place which was pretty straight forward. There are small signs for the Spa as you get closer so you know you're going the right way.As soon as we arrived you were made to feel special - the host was very friendly and welcoming and took us to a beautiful seating area to discuss what was going to happen and to check we were happy with everything. We also chose how strong we wanted our massage to be and were then lead into the changing room (only used by one couple at a time) and given our pants and robes to change into. The two ladies who did our hammam were so lovely and friendly - we got to choose our scrub and they gave us some to take away. They were very thorough and my skin has felt wonderful for days following their hard work!Following the hammam we took mint tea and snacks in another seating area and relaxed for a few minutes before being lead downstairs for our massage. We had our massages in adjoining rooms and chose our oils following suggestions from the therapists. The massage itself was really thorough and relaxing - I opted for medium strength one and my partner requested firm, although not a lot of force was really used. The decor is traditional yet modern, all very clean and relaxing. Staff at our Riad also recommended the place and said it offers reasonable prices compared to many of the upmarket spas in the medina. As you leave you are given a 10% discount voucher for a restaurant in Marrakech - we didn't use this as it seems quite far in the wrong direction for us, but might be worth it if you are staying in the area for longer.Highly recommend to others - a fab experience."

From the moment we entered the spa, the pace of everything seemed to slow right down. We were greeted warmly and were sat down with mint tea and talked through our treatments. Then, once we had changed, we were led up to the top floor for the hammam. The therapists were very professional and friendly and after this we sat on some cushions for more tea, water and biscuits. After about 10 mins, we were led to our separate massage rooms which were dimly lit and quiet. The massage was better than I have experienced at high end spas in the UK and I actually fell asleep! We both left feeling extremely relaxed and content and I would happily recommend this spa to anyone visiting Marrakech."

            "review": "A delightful treat for the body and soul. This isn't the least expensive way to enjoy a Moroccan hammam but it is luxurious and you will feel pampered when you are finished. The spa is in the Medina, tucked away in a narrow alley. Inside, there is a small alcove where you sip tea and choose the essential oil fragrance you want for oil and soap. Then you are whisked upstairs to change into disposable underpants and a robe. The steam room has heated marble slabs and can hold up to three people. My slab was a bit short for me (I'm six feet tall and longer if I stretch out.) If you are two in a steam room, one slab is long enough for two people, so for a couple with a tall man (or woman) one slab will be long enough. After a suitable steaming under an application of Moroccan black soap, you get exfoliated with a glove by the attendant, then rinsed off. You get to take the (wet) glove home with you in a plastic bag as a souvenir. Yes, it is amazing how the exfoliation removes rolls of dead skin cells. It's effective. After the traditional hammam, you relax in a room decorated like a Berber tent and have water and some sweetmeats (handmade chocolates.) Then off to a massage. My massage was one of the best I'd ever had. The music was familiar, too--some of the same relaxation music I use at home to de-stress. The only quibble was that my five minutes of relaxation after the massage in the darkened room seemed too short--they were busy. And that is a warning; a couple who stopped by the front desk was turned away for not having a reservation. So you should make a reservation. I enjoyed it, felt entirely renewed and relaxed.The spa presents you with a parting gift of Moroccan-made soap to remember them by--that was a nice touch. I wish I could go to the hammam every week. It was a lovely experience and I can recommend the Heritage."

Although sceptical of such excellent reviews I can only say that it is an exceptionnal and authentic hamman & spa where they search for excellence and are highly professional. The staff is discreet and welcoming, the hygene immpecable and the little attentions dellightful. It may be a wee bit more expensive than what are considered other top end spas but after trying the others there is no comparison. Both my husband and teenage daughter absolutely loved it. Note that it is in the medina and not very easy to find so recommend that you look at the short video on how to get there."

The manager explained the services to us, asked us all the proper spa questions (allergies, skin types) and then we were whisked away to the hammam to start our services. The entire time we were there we were pampered and taken care of. The products they use and the women who work there were the absolute most talented and professional I've ever encountered in a spa setting.

Being a man alone, I was a bit comceremd about the stress on couples and wondered about privacy. My fears were unfounded and I was given my treatments in completely private quarters. The treatments themselves were superb and the extras (teas, water, cakes, soap) all contributed to a delightful time.

At my request for a hammam (Turkish bath) recommendation, the manager of our Riad (Dixneuf la Ksour) suggested that my husband and I try the Heritage Spa, which accommodates couples. We had the \u201cDestination Marrakech\u201d combination (650 dh each), with a traditional scrubbing and massage. The massage by Sara was utterly relaxing and restorative.Among the many things I liked about this experience, the manager did a great job of explaining what we were about to experience---this was great as my husband had not previously been in a hamman. And while you opt for a package of treatments, it is further personalized (without extra charge) to your desires: you can choose among many scents, and also the type of massage---whether you want it to be relaxing or more therapeutic. I can't wait for another trip to Marrakech to experience this again! I cannot recommend highly enough."

After searching online, Heritage Spa appeared to be the obvious choice and it didn't let us down.We went for the Destination Marrakech package which included a couples hammam followed by full body massages for the both of us. Once we arrived we were given some mint tea and asked to choose our massage oils and hammam body mask. We both opted for the traditional eucalyptus and moroccan clay glassoul for the hammam. After changing into fluffy dressing gowns, we then went into our hammam rooms where we were soaped, scrubbed, masked and washed. Lovely experience (although be prepared for a very thorough scrub!) and shocking how much we both needed to exfoliate! Feeling the cleanest we had done in a long time, we were then given our dressing gowns and slippers and taken to a room full of relaxing cushions where we were provided with more tea and some sweet treats on.Soon we were taken for our massages. The masseuses have a heavenly touch and we both agreed that this was the best massage that we have ever had. Afterwards, extremely relaxed, we were taken to a lovely bed-like seating area and given more tea and treats.Heritage is a little spot of paradise within the hectic medina. The staff are friendly, discreet and it was so peaceful that we didn't want to leave to catch our flight. We were given our hammam scrubbing gloves and a special soap to take home which was a nice gesture. We highly recommend a visit to heritage spa, it is worth every penny/dirham."

The spa was very traditional looking but you felt familiar with it immediately.The host was brilliant - welcoming, confident and friendly. The facilities were clean and very presentable.The hammam and massages were amazing!

He discussed our booking with us and suggested a more suitable, surprisingly cheaper, package. The hammam option arranged, we opted for Beldi Detox, we were invited to choose our preferred massage oils from a wide and sumptuous range.We were given a clear and concise explanation of what we should expect and the protocol involved in the hammam and then led to the changing area.Fluffy white robes and traditional slippers donned, we made our way to the double salon where Amena and Raja treated us to a thoroughly refreshing and stimulating experience. My skin has never felt so alive!I have often found massages in the past to be robotic and formulaic, delivered by a masseuse with half an eye on the clock. On this occasion, they were sheer bliss. Our masseuse took great care to ensure that each part of each of us received the same acute attention to detail.We repaired to a lavish lounge feeling revived and invigorated where we drank sweet mint tea and savoured Moroccan patisserie.The pedicures were thorough and precise. My feet enjoyed exactly the treat they deserved having been dragged through souks, waterfalls, mountain passes and windswept beaches these last few days.Little did they know, they had one more big treat coming their way...As Darlingka sat back for a magnificent manicure, the feet and I were led away for the most sensational foot massage. If my feet could speak, they would be thanking the rest of me for the remainder of our natural lives.All told, we spent the best part of 4 hours treating ourselves for a miserly sum equating to a little more than \u00a3100.I cannot rate Heritage highly enough. We all deserve a little pampering from time to time, I recommend you do it here."

The hammam was very authentic compared to the public hammam, except I don't think they were as thorough with the scrubbing. I felt like they did miss bits. My partner found the scrubbing a bit too intense and his skin was very sore afterwards. It may be worth letting the ladies know if you have sensitive skin - my partner doesn't have sensitive skin but he doesn't often use harsh scrub treatments. The massages were good but nothing special. We really enjoyed being able to choose the oils they use and the mint tea and treats between treatments.

Came here twice with my girlfriend during our holiday in Marrakech - first time for a 45min hamman (290 dirhams - approx \u00a320), and secondly for a 1hr massage (450 dirhams - approx \u00a330). Chose Heritage Spa due to its popularity on Tripadvisor.It was the first time we had had a hamman so didn't know what to expect. Booked it the same morning with a 200 dirham deposit, and came back 15mins before the start time (highly recommended to give enough time to get changed & lock possessions away etc beforehand). We were greeted and taken to the changing room where the lockers are and given robes, slippers & hilarious underwear to change into before heading to the hamman steam room. The hamman itself was good and the 2 ladies that scrubbed us were light-hearted and made us feel at ease. Not particularly relaxing, but was glad me & my partner were put together in the same steam room otherwise the 15-20min period where the staff leave you for the treatments to 'soak in' would've been very boring & agitated. After we were washed down we were shown to a lovely room full of cushions and romantic decor to have a delicious mint tea and selection of chocolates. My girlfriend was also given a token gift of soap on departure.The hamman was not really our thing but we were so impressed with the service that we decided to go back at the end of our holiday for a massage. This time we booked the night before with a deposit of 100 dirhams (strangely less than last time even though the treatments were more expensive). We were greeted by a very welcoming French lady who was great in ensuring we were relaxed and got the perfect massage we wanted. After a welcome mint tea and treats she asked us to choose what scent of oil & what pressure we each wanted for our massages. We were taken to separate rooms but can tell you I've never felt so relaxed in my life - amazing massage. I asked for a particularly strong massage and the masseuse did just that, giving a perfect balance of firm pressure and sensuality without me being uncomfortable or tensed up at all. The smell of the Rose and Sandal oil was great too. After the massage the French lady was very attentive to asking how the the massages went & gave us 2 complimentary soaps on departure.Overall a great massage experience, lovely facilities & d\u00e9cor, good customer service and well worth the money!"

We changed the package to two facials instead of the foot massage and the spa were so helpful and happy to change it. The hammam was an unusual experience but thoroughly enjoyed it. The massage and facial was even better!! Massage wise one of the best I've had! My partner ended up having a foot massage as they forgot we had asked to change the package to two facials but we didn't mind and they discounted the cost accordingly. Lovely spa and would certainly go back. The only criticism was that there was another couple having the same package done at the same time and we were asked our preferences at the same time in the same room. This would have been much better if this would have been done separately."

As I was with my boyfriend (who had never been to any kind of spa before) we went all out and chose the Heritage Romance package so that we could have a variety of treatments together. After taking mint tea in a lovely relaxing nook, we were led upstairs to a private changing area where we changed into robes and slippers and put out belongings in a locker. Then to the hammam where we had a vigorous savon noire scrub down and body mask in a hot chamber. Came out as smooth as babies!Next we were given time to cool down in another relaxation area with more mint tea and treats, before heading for the most divine full body massage. This was followed with a foot massage for my partner and a fantastic facial for me. I absolutely loved the whole experience. The staff were fantastic and the environment was lovely. We were made to feel so comfortable and relaxed throughout - particularly my partner who was a little nervous of what might be involved. We both had a lovely experience and can wholeheartedly recommend Heritage Spa. Thank you for making my birthday so very special."

The staff speak some English and French so it is easy to communicate. The rooms are so relaxing and between treatments you have more herb tea and small cakes.

Ironically we came across the Heritage Spa whilst trying to find another spa that we had booked in advance (which we never found!). Luckily for us they had availability for that same day so we booked the traditional Hammam for two, 290dirhams each. This was much more reasonable than the spa we had actually booked so we were pretty pleased as not only had we managed to find a spa, with same day availability, but saved a few dirhams in the process! The lady on the front desk was very friendly and welcoming, explaining the process to us in advance over mint tea and letting us choose what type of soap we preferred. Robes and slippers were provided along with the obligatory paper underwear and there were lockers with keys for our belongings. My husband and I were pleased that we were able to experience the Hammam together in a room for two (some places separate men and women and we had read about others where you were in a room with other people). The ladies that gave us the Hammam scrub were lovely, very friendly, didn't speak much English but a few words (turn over, sit up!) were all they needed. Bottles of mineral water were provided too. The service was fab, the products smelt gorgeous and we felt very clean and refreshed afterwards! To top it off more mint tea and some Moroccan pastries to finish. The lady on reception even gave us a gift of some soap scrub at the end. Great experience and good value for money compared to some of the other higher end spa's."

After researching a number of reviews on different spas around the area I was staying in during my week in Marrakech, I decided to go with Heritage Spa, it was down the road from the riad I was staying at so that was a bonus. I booked the Heritage experience for both my sister and myself and I cannot recommend it enough.The entire experience lasted around 6 hours, we went at 10am and left the spa around 4pm feeling completely refreshed. It was my birthday so I chose to be pampered and the staff at the spa were brilliant. We started with a hammam, full body massage, pedicure, facial and then another fully body massage with herbs. The staff are very hospitable and kind, I never felt rushed and really were treated like queens from the minute we entered the doors to when we left. There is lots of mint tea and relaxing breaks between treatments so it was all done in a very relaxing manner.Ali was very kind to offer my sister and me a gift voucher for a free massage on the day we were flying back to the UK as a gift for my birthday, which was very sweet.I had Amelia/Amelle for my massages and she is a true gem, a very sweet girl who made sure I was comfortable throughout the day. I would definitely recommend others to come here and if I was to ever go back to Marrakech, I would be coming back here."

I go to the hammam regularly in London and therefore am well versed to the experience and so I was expecting this to be a authentic experience which it certainly was. We had the hammam exclusive package which in total lasted about 4 hours and included in addition to the hammam, a massage and a facial. The hammam itself was excellent and left my skin feeling clean and soft. The therapist rubbed argan oil on my feet and hands to soften them after the scrub down which was a nice added extra as most treatments don\u2019t include this. The products used were also of a high quality. The Moroccan pastries and the mint tea served after the treatment were a real treat and just what we needed along with cold mint water. The massage was also really relaxing - the use of pressure was just right. The facial was good too. Overall a great find\u2026 if you are a looking for a hammam which is cosy with great treatments this is definitely the one. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us and were friendly and helpful. However, this place is a little difficult to find so I would suggest that you arrange to reach there by taxi. We asked the same taxi guy to pick us up- if you take his number, one of the staff at the hammam will call him and arrange this for you."

My partner and I went there the day before to see the menu and book it. The owner offered us tea and water while he was explaining the different packages. We booked a couples package for the next day. It consisted of an hour hammam treatment where my partner and I stayed together. During that time, the ladies put soap and other products on you, you decide which scent you want beforehand, in intervals of 10 minutes more or less. During that time, you can ask for complementary water since the temperature is high. After that, we were brought to a different room where we were offered tea and pastries. We could relax, cool down and have nice music in the background. Really a nice touch! Then we went for an hour massage. At this time my partner and I were separated. The massage was amazing. The package included also a facial and feet massage. After those 2, we were done and changed back to our clothes. At the exit, we were also offered 2 soaps, one for me and one for my partner.It was a great day, 2 and a half hour for 1700 Dirham total for 2 people is a really good price. The atmosphere is really good and the people professional and gentle.

It was wonderful experience. After hammam my skin was a skin of a newborn child. Then we were invited to massage. It was the best massage I have ever had. Masseuse really hit the spot. After massage I had facial care. It was wonderful. I truly recommend you to visit this spa if you are in Marrakech"

It was difficult to find down a small alley but the staff were very welcoming and made us feel completely relaxed. We went for the \"couples\" treatment which included a hammam, full body massage and facial/pedicure. It worked out around \u00a370 per person but I think it was good value for what was included. All staff were friendly and constantly made sure we were enjoying our experience. They gave us a free bar of soap and exfoliator to take away which was a nice little touch. It was a perfect way to relax after exploring the city and I would thoroughly recommend this spa!"

We were ushered into a waiting room where we had a few minutes to decide which oils we wanted used during our massage and also drank some tea. When we were ready, we were guided into the changing room and then got out exfoliating rubs. Afterwards, we had a few minutes to drink tea and relax before our messages.

We ended up arriving a bit early and as such had to wait for until our booked time, however to stop us getting bored we were given a free foot massage which was very relaxing. The hammam itself was very relaxing and felt very thorough, we were both thoroughally scrubbed until our skin felt soft and new. The staff were very professional and at no point did we feel embaressed or awkward despite being almost naked during the treatments. After the Hammam we were led into a roof top tent where we were given tea and water and another foot massage. All in all it was an excellent experience, the spa is very clean and the staff are professional and welcoming, we'd definitely book again."

The experience was lovely and really put me at ease - not knowing what to expect. My partner and I had dual treatment rooms for both the massage and hammam which was a lovely touch and it is a very luxurious place to be. before the treatments we were offered tea and discussed what we wanted to get out of the treatments and chose our products, we then had the hammam and after this had another cup of tea and a glass of minted water with sweets before going for our massage. following our massage we were given time to recover before dressing etc, and as we left we were both given an argan oil soap to take home included in the price. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!"

My visit was arranged through the Riad in which I stayed. The spa is in the Old Town and is reached on foot through a series of alleys, but don't let that put you off (its part of the adventure). Stepping through the front door is like entering an oasis of tranquility. The staff are all friendly and professional and their hospitality is warm and welcoming.I indulged in the Destination Marrakech package, which involved a thorough cleansing by the ladies in the authentic hammam followed by the most relaxing massage I think I've ever had. The relaxation rooms are straight out of the pages of The Arabian Nights. Here mint tea and smiles abound. Just relax and enjoy.No visit to this hot, bustling city would be complete without a visit to Heritage Spa. Go on, treat yourself."

We were greeted and ushered into a little room and given tea during our wait for our \"Destination Marrakech\" hammam and massage. I had injured my heel and leg prior to our trip so having to walk up a flight of steep steps to the changing room was a bit challenging. Once we were outfitted in our disposable underwear and robes we climbed another flight of stairs up to our hammam room which was extremely hot and steamy. I was not prepared for the intense heat and was somewhat overwhelmed by the hot tiles and room temperature but our hammam attendants were very attentive and helpful at helping me cool down. We were scrubbed and sprayed all over and both my husband and I felt fresh and ready for more mint tea before we headed downstairs for our massages. I enjoyed my massage but I don't think my Therapist was as experienced as others I have found in the US, Thailand, an on cruise ships. We enjoyed our time at Heritage Spa and would recommend it to others but only if you do not have difficulty with stairs or can tolerate high heat and humidity."

Decided to treat my wife to a spa visit during our 4 day stay in Marakech as we had experienced massages from everywhere between Bali and Brighton!After a glass of mint tea we were taken up some narrow stairs to a changing room where we were given a locker for our clothes and belongings, a bath robe and slippers and some paper underwear!First off we were put into the \"Scrub Room\" very hot stone tables to lay on whilst being scrubbed all over with a scouring pad glove, I watched as a layer of skin was removed all over, was this pleasure or torture! A layer of mud was then plastered over us as we were left to bake on the hit slabs! Once this was washed off, we were taken to a tented roof area for more mint tea and a chocolate, the ladies who scrubbed us were very good, all part of the Hamas experience. We were then led into the massage room, mood lighting, warm and the soothing music soon relaxed you whilst the massage was given. This was extremely well done, the oil was chosen by us from a selection of six which were offered to us at the start of the visit and the girls doing the massage were given instructions as to our preferences - hard or gentle - as you desired!The whole experience took 2 1/2 hours, and cost 1,300 DH for the two of us. A day later and even after 2 showers, I still feel relaxed and my skin is still smooth and silky and slightly oily, well worth the money - and the torture!We were guided there by the staff from the Riad and found our own way back, it's not that difficult to find as there are signs all around the area but you need to watch how you get there if you want to find your own way back as the streets are a labyrinth and it's easy to go round in circles or in a direction you don't want to go in!A very enjoyable experience and as good as any Balinese Spa massage. My wife was given a bar of soap as we left and we were given the \"Scouring Glove\" so we can torture each other when we get home!"

We did the romance package and the process was explained to us while we sipped on mint tea and picked our massage oil. The Hammam was great...never felt so clean in my life! The rest room where you are again offered a mint tea and chocolates was a nice surprise. We were then taken for massages/facials/treatments - all of which were relaxing. We were even given a complimentary hammam glove and soap to take home with us! By the time we were done we all felt fabulously looked after! If you are after a spa to spend time at during your visit, I totally recommend this one!"

The hamman changed our whole concept of what bathing means and I probably left half a pound of old skin behind. Every detail was attended to, the service was stellar, I was in heaven from beginning to end, and as an added nice touch we both were gifted souvenir soaps in the same scent we had picked for our massage oil. This was the most amazing experience I had in Morocco. Period."

We booked Hammam and massage for two. After an explanatory session with a mint tee we were shown the changing rooms with lockers. Then we started the hammam session on the roof of the riad. Me and my partner shared the small and hot hammam room together. Two women did the treatment with oils, essence and mud. You feel very good after it. After a good resting pause in a tent in the roof with mint tea and a small sweet bite we did the massage session. Me and my partner took the relaxing massage with some pressure. We both thought that the ladies that did the massage were very professional. We were deeply relaxed after this. The room where the massage is done is warm, dimmed and relaxing music is being played. After the massage the ladies let us rest (sleep) for some time. All in all it was a very nice experience: the riad, the decoration, the music, the staff, the massage ladies and the manager. I highly recommend this place.PS: It seems the location is difficult to find. We used the location hinted by Google Maps and it was straight forward. Several panels guide you the last meters from the main road to the spa."

As soon as it was we were shown to the dressing room where they had lockers for your things and then to the Hamman itself. Both my partner and I found it a very pleasant experience, the Hamman was lovely and hot, just right in fact and the treatments and scrubs were done well. The ladies were kind, offering us water, checking we were ok, that nothing was too hard, too hot etc. Fantastic. We then went to relax for a while together with some mint tea which was nice and gave us a bit of together time. We were then shown to the massage room, we had a double room not like the reviewer below but in all reality when you are having your massage you don't talk to your partner anyway, infact we were both totally in a world of our own anyway - the massage was great! The ladies were really well trained, I had a more relaxing massage and my partner a more rigourous sports massage as we were asked what we wanted. We both loved the experience and came out feeling amazing, super relaxed, very very clean from the Hamman and super soft! Absolutely recommend. Staff were exceptionally kind, helpful and attentive."

I've booked this spa treatment before we arrived in Marrakesh and although the process was slightly challenging due to the deposit requirement it was well worth the effort . The Heritage Spa was not easy to find but once we did arrive the staff was very welcoming. If you're not familiar with the area you should definitely hire a guide. We purchased the couples treatment which included a scrub, a massage, and a facial. This was a fantastic value and better than anything else we found in Marrakesh. I get a massage twice a month so I thought that the massage was just average but good for a spa. We had to add a facial because you only get one with the couples package that we purchased, but both facials were excellent.The famous scrub was what we were looking forward to, however, I was disappointed. You are taken into a room with a slab of warm stone, in this case it was as a couple, and you're wearing only a disposable thong. We were both in the room relaxing comfortably awaiting the staff member to begin the scrub service. It was a female technician for both of us and the experience was different depending on sex. My female companion enjoyed the scrub and thought it was thorough and invigorating. I was disappointed in my scrub because the female attendant seemed to be shy to get into all of the areas of the body (i.e. nether region and buttocks) and so that diminished the value and therefore the effect of the scrub for me.I don't believe that the female staff person was holding back, I think she was just young/shy to perform this on a man. I think that the service may be catered more towards women so I would suggest this: either hire male staff members that can perform the scrub or instruct the female staff members to make sure that they provide equal treatment for both men and women.The experience with the scrub notwithstanding, my companion and I both enjoyed our treatments at the Heritage Spa. We were treated to a gift at the end of our session and the entire experience was very comfortable. We would both go back to the Heritage Spa if our travels take us to Marrakesh once again."

            "review": "A very strange experience. First the good things. We were six women, well traveled, in town for a weekend. We scheduled three treatments each. The Hamman Scrub was well done. The rooms were hot, but comfortable. The women were well trained. I completely enjoyed the experience. The hot stone massage (and other various massages received) were set in luxurious rooms with lovely low lighting and pleasant music. The masseuse was young and seemed adequately trained. She worked hard.Now for the strange parts:The reception room was a makeshift room on the roof. The rugs for sitting on the floor were well worn. Our manicures/pedicures were done ON the massage tables. The pedicures required you to lie on your back and get your foot into a bucket of hot water. This was uncomfortable and awkward. The manicures were poorly done. Our cuticles were cut so short they hurt and bled. We each came to the conclusion that the girls were under-trained. I felt if they do not have room for a proper manicure/pedicure station, they should not offer the treatment.Climbing to the reception room I had to step over someone's legs. He was in a treatment room so small that his feet hung out of the curtain providing his privacy.Finally, during our stay, a woman (not from our group) passed out in the Hamman. She was carried by her wrists and ankles ACROSS the Spa absolutely naked and placed indecorously on the rugs of the reception room. No effort was made to provide for her modesty.In review, the Hamman is too small for the number of treatments they offer. The staff was not professionally trained. Parts of the Hamman are in need of remodeling/redecorating.I wish this place well, but it was not what we expected."

Great value for money and the very best way to kick start your holiday .We will definitely return"

Also the applied products seem to be of excellent quality. Reading some of the previous comments, I would like to add, that Heritage Spa is a well known place and often fully booked, but it was never disturbing to me. I had a 10 min. break to wait for the next treatment and during this time I was offered a free 10 min foot massage - tea, mint water, biscuits - Nothing was missing ! So, that is why I am rating this Spa with \"Excellent\"."

Both my partner and I had a hammam followed by massage (my partner) and facial (myself) and expected a wonderfully relaxing experience based on the reviews and the reward of excellence by trip adviser which is proudly displayed on every wall in the hammam. Although reasonably satisfied with the treatments, the whole experience left us feeling a bit let down. The hammam is clearly very busy and possibly for that reason the predominant feeling is of being 'processed' rather than taken care of. There seems to be confusion over who is looking after whom, long waiting times in-between stages (2 hour treatment took 3 hours in total), even the staff get confused who they were treating, as was the case in our hammam. The selection of massage oils that was offered was never acknowledged and implemented into the treatment. In the case of my facial a skin assessment was \u00a0not done even though i was told it would follow after the hammam and before the facial. Overall a very average experience even though the individual staff was lovely and professional, which is a pity. This hammam is clearly a victim of it's own success and being too busy is not able to deliver the excellence it's capable of."

However this spa was recommended to me by the new manager of the Riad I stay at and I ended up paying two visits it was so good. My first visit was for the Heritage Beaute including hammam, massage and facial and was blissful. The owner has a chat first just to check what you have booked for and asks you to choose your massage oil whilst you sip tea and minted water. After changing you are taken to the roof area where the hammams are and treated to a full exfoliation and body wash with black soap and local clay all carried out in a heated room and this is followed by more tea and petits fours whilst you await your next treatment. The masseuse was excellent and for all her small size she had some strength in those hands as well as gentleness and after one hour I was feeling markedly less tense. She followed this by a wonderful facial to finish. I left after 3 hours of relaxation with gifts of shampoo, an exfoliation mitt and I bought a supply of black soap. Two days later I returned for a further massage on a troublesome neck and shoulder and was please that I had been given the same girl for this. Ali and his wife run a superb place and it is one I shall certainly visit again on my next trip."

We dropped in the day before we wanted to go and sat with the very helpful manager to understand all the packages available. We were given mint tea and much of his time which we really appreciated.The next day we went in and had all the treatments explained to us so we knew what to expect of the traditional Hammam treatment. They perform this treatment in private rooms for couples which is great.We also had a facial and foot treatment both of which were very well done.Highly recommended."

I had went to for the traditional hammam first, which was quite an interesting experience, but felt so good. After enjoying that treatment I was led to a room for some tea, water and sweets and even got a little head massage. From there I was led down to a hot stone massage. All the services were delightful, the staff was charming, the place was very clean. They also helped me to get to and from my riad which I appreciated greatly. I would highly recommend a visit to Heritage Spa while in Marrakech."

BUT I wasn't happy with a man being around the spa and definitely not happy with him towel drying my hair whilst I sat about in a robe. Call me prudish but I would have liked this to have been done by a woman. My daughter did point out he was there for security reasons as men too are clients but I still think his services should be carefully evaluated and if nothing, I should have been given a choice.MInt tea and cakes - lovelyAnd the giving of free soap bars, a lovely touch.Recommend it highly....."

It felts amazing being scrubbed all over and getting all the nasty dead skin cells off. We then had our massage with great music and ambience and lots of delicious tea and cookies in-between. The owner then let the driver take us into town to do some errands and then brought us back to the hotel. Only downside about this place is that the products for sale there are more than double the price so get the names and buy them elsewhere."

We were greeted by the owner of the Heritage Spa, who told us all about how the hammam works and has been used in Morocco. He was terribly apologetic that we were running 10 minutes late for our treatment, and after explaining that I was in Marrakech celebrating my 21st he offered my friend and me a complimentary foot massage following the hammam! The hammam itself was incredible and was followed by Moroccan sweets and, of course, mint tea! We didn't need to lift a finger whilst we were there, as we had our dressing gowns tied for us and our hair dried and everything! I've never felt so soft and clean in my life!We chose this spa because it was rated no.1 on Trip Advisor, and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to experience a hamman in total luxury and bliss! It's also pleasantly located in a quieter part of the old city."

We got the Destination Marrakech package - billed as 1h 45mins but we were in there 3 hours because they really do spoil you. In between the hammam and massage treatments we were left in a cosy nook with biscuits, cool water and mint tea. The hammam was done together and they made my boyfriend as comfortable as he could be with nothing but a bit of paper covering his modesty.. The massages were then done individually, and were absolute bliss. They check that the pressure is ok for you at the start and you choose your massage oil, lovely. Highly recommend it - might be a bit more expensive but it is completely worth it, and definitely less than you'd pay in England. Also they accept PayPal which was useful for us."

Then after about 45 minutes we sat in a relaxation room for about ten minutes. We were given mint tea again with biscuits while we waited to be called for our massages. The massages were absolutely just what we needed after a horrendous day being led around souks and tanneries. Its such a shame we cant afford to have this done everyday :) would recommend to anyone visiting marrakech. Thank you to Ali and all the girls for making our visit so special x"

The spa is very well signposted from around the back of the Bab Dokala mosque (where you can be dropped by taxi). It is a small spa run by a French husband and wife team. The manager was very friendly and welcoming, and recommended that we change from the hot stone massage we had booked to a normal massage due to the heat outside. This meant we ended up paying less, so it was nice of her to recommend the switch. The hammam was very thorough - I have never felt so clean! - and the ladies doing it taught us lots about the role of hammams in their culture without intruding on our relaxing time. We were given mint tea and snacks between our treatment in a very comfortable chill out room. The massage was one of the best I have ever had; they really listened to exactly what I wanted and delivered it. Upon leaving, the manager gave my sister a birthday present of a bottle of orange blossom massage oil. The whole experience (1 hour 45 minutes) cost about the same as you'd pay for a 30 minute massage in London."

We were shown into a chill area to make our oil selections and have a mint tea nice touch however I didn't think the area was that nice and the shawl we were sitting on looked grubby. After this we were shown upstairs to the hammam were we had basically two women one really young give us our scrub and wash etc chilled for 5 mins then onto another chill area afain just an outdide area tented and it was boiling hot in there, we again had tea and water cookies again. This part was okay but not the best and I tell you why later! Then onto the massage we were split up at this point and showed to a nice room and had the body massages and facial. This I would say was the best part if the whole experience nice music playing and dimmed lights very good indeed and massage was great! Now the reason why I can't give more than 3 stars is because we were staying at the la maison arabe like 2 mins away and had a hammam and body mask there and it was amazing! The spa and hammam area was just gorgeous and we could not believe how nice the spa and their hammam was it was much more relaxing. At the heritage we felt like we were at a cattle market shifted from one area to the next or on a production line. The la maison arabe hammam was much bigger for 2 people and was proper steam getting pumped in there it was do much better than heritage. Also the spa area was so nicer if was pure luxury in comparison. The last reason no 3 stars is I did not like the owner constantly being about and at the end u are gave a small gift of soap very nice but then the male owner said I have another gift for you I wax then took to a little area where they sell products like oil etc he pointed to z bigger soap for me to take it just felt like I was being shown to this area to buy something I picked up the same soap as already given but slighty bigger one and we then left. It was not a bad experience but now we tried the la maison I would go there 100% before the heritage."

Having just arrived in Marrakech, we wandered by accident to the door of this spa while looking for a Riad to stay in and the owner, Ali, was helpfulness personified when he took considerable time and trouble to offer us several choices which he Google'd up for us. His TA certificate of excellence was proudly displayed on the wall and we made a mental note to return for a hammam if our two-day schedule allowed. We went to the nearby Riad he suggested as best for us and it was a good choice.We returned the day after to escape the intense Marrakech heat and take in a hammam with massage. It is a wonderful, compact spa where Ali's staff take their work seriously under his knowledgeable direction. He is an expert in his field. It's a quite different experience to a regular public hammam (a good deal dearer too) as he focuses the emphasis on a luxurious dream rather than a simple back scrub and wash. Its a real ladies pamper venue. You were constantly being offered cold water or Moroccan tea to refresh and revive you as you progressed through the hammam and massage pathway. His market is spa rather than public bath and he serves it well. More like Wilmslow than Morocco, our treatment took almost three hours but the price matched it. The massage was the high spot which was an almost magical sensory journey.You must try it if you are in Marrakech."

The lady who did the massage had amazing hands - it felt like floating on air. The hamam itself was incredibly professional and well done, and designed to put you at ease - at no point did you feel self conscious or worry about anything. Constant refreshments were provided while waiting by a very friendly gentleman, who even taught us a little arabic, which was nice.I must also recommend you try the facial and manicure treatments, they went above and beyond anything I had hoped for or expected. The manicure in particular was one of the best I have experienced anywhere in the world. In short - do not leave Marrakesh without trying this place, you'd be a fool to miss it."

We booked a package of treatments, the Heritage Beaute, at Dh950 (approx \u00a375) for a Hamman, Massage and Facial lasting 2.5 hours. I completed this online before I left for Marrakech paying a deposit of \u20ac50 through paypal. You can get cheaper in Marrakech but in my view the experience here was well worth the price. I will point out that the one negative review I see on her was written shortly after the Spa opened 17 months ago. All new businesses have teething problems so don't let that one put you off focus on the new reviews!We decided to walk there, I am sorry I can not remember which of the old city gates we entered but it was basically a straight line in from there and sign posted so very easy to locate.We arrived an hour early, having given ourselves plenty of time to find the place not sure if we were able to wait but were welcomed in. We went into a quiet seating area for mint tea and water whilst we completed a form to assist in deciding which facial to have and testing the oils for our massage. We were then taken through to a changing area, where we were given paper pants (not big pants more thongs!) robes, slippers and a locker with key into which we could safely store our things. We were taken up to the roof to a sauna, lovely warm stone where we were washed then soaped and left to relax for a while, then the ladies came back in and commenced the Haman which included washing our hair, it's amazing seeing how much dead skin comes off! Then we were covered in a sort of clay and left to relax again before being washed down my skin felt the best it's ever felt! We were put back into our robes and given a towel for our hair and taken through to the relaxation area for more mint tea, water and biscuits. The man in here was lovely he dried our hair, a lovely head rub and held the fan higher to cool us. After a little while we went to our own treatment rooms for our massages and facials. The massage was incredible a proper tips of your toes to the top of your head massage! I drifted off a number of times! At one point my beautician was on the bed to provide more downward pressure on my back massage absolutely fantastic!Then she moved onto my facial which was the longest facial I have ever had! I chose a facial that reduces fine lines and wrinkles. I think I was washed and oiled about 3 times! The Haman did not touch the face but she seemed to use some milder sort of mitt on my face. Then the massage on the face oh my how wonderful! Your ears are massaged even your eyeballs! I felt her doing lymphatic drainage where they massage puffiness out of your face my eyes were quite bad before I went in. Then there was a seaweed mask that feels really thick and creamy then sets and peels off. Well I have to tell you i've never had a facial like this before it was INCREDIBLE! My skin felt so beautiful and silky, my eyes were no longer puffy and it did reduce fine lines around my eyes. I wish I could have that facial again over here!!After this we came back down to get changed then were invited back into the relaxation area at the bottom for more mint tea and water and to pay. We were here for 3.5 hours in total bliss!!The lady who owns the Spa with her husband was lovely and gave me some black soap for my birthday! We both had a haman mitt each to take away too! Then she phoned our Riad so that Sanna could organise our taxi to collect us then the lovely man from the roof took us to the collection point and waited with us until he arrived! Amazing service from start to finish!Thank you to the Heritage Spa for an amazing afternoon I won't be forgetting in a hurry I will be sure to recommend anyone visit you when in Marrakech!"

From the Hammam treatment to the massage to the hospitality in between services, we were very impressed. The building itself is beautiful, in a historic area within the medina. While it is a bit of a labyrinth, as prior reviewers warned, we found that a Heritage employee was waiting for us where the cabs drop people off. That prevented any possibility of getting lost or being hassled by touts--and that high level of attentiveness to detail followed through the entire experience.

Located in a quiet residential neighborhood with narrow streets, we were taken aback by the world class service and amenities offered here.The owner, Ali, and his wife (a Moroccan and European expat) were kind, welcoming and sat with us for 15-20 minutes to discuss our treatments over mint tea, cucumber water and biscuits before heading to our couples hammam black soap bath.Even though it was 100+ degrees outside, the hammam itself was surprisingly comfortable - outside of the nudity. The therapist was sweet and kind and soon inhibitions washed away like all the dead skin we'd been toting around.After, we were lead to a breezy cabana area where we were served more tea, cucumber water and cookies. About 20 minutes later, the massage therapists showed up and brought us to the first floor and into beautifully lit rooms with ubiquitous spa music. I'll cut to the chase here. I'm not a fan of massages because I've never really gotten one I loved. I loved this one. In fact, it may just be the best massage I've gotten in my life.

Our visit began with refreshments and an explanation by the owner of what was in store for us. We were given a variety of oils to choose from for our massage and also the type of massage we would like.If you've never experienced a Hammam before, I highly recommend it. This was probably the best part of the whole package. The women who looked after us were really friendly and made us feel very comfortable. We both really loved the body scrubs.The massage and facial I had afterwards almost sent me to sleep, it was so good. My skin really has never felt better. Overall, for two and a half hours of bliss it was well worth the money. The parting gift was a nice added touch and we will definitely be back again soon."

We read the reviews on Tripadvisor and chose the Heritage Spa. We are so happy we did. Everything about this place is wonderful. We had quite a stressful journey with a taxi driver dropping us off at the opposite side of the city nowhere near the spa and then being threatened by a horrible guy. When we arrived at the spa I was really stressed and in tears but the owner totally put us at ease and even gave us a complimentary treatment before our package to help ease us in to the day. All of the staff are lovely and treat you really well. We had the oasis package with a hammam followed by a massage. This was fab and really relaxing. our skin felt really soft afterwards.It was so good that we went back a second time during our stay when I had a facial and my other half another massage. Again this was lovely and a really relaxing end to the holiday.If you're in Marrakech you must visit this place. A tip to get there as it's a bit out of the way- ask your taxi driver to drop you outside the Dar Moha restaurant and you will pick up signs - it's a couple of minutes walk."

            "review": "Highlight of our trip. If you're interested in a Hammam experience but are a little unsure DO NOT HESITATE! This was by far and away the highlight of our visit. My husband was in Marrakech for work in late June 2013 and I joined him at the end of two weeks, by which time he was completely exhausted. He only had one day to \"do\" the city before we flew out, so I made sure to book him into the Heritage Spa after having read about it on TripAdvisor. First of all, it IS a little tricky to find, but have your cab call the Spa (everyone has cellphones) in order to get the exact directions. It's about a three minute walk from where the cab drops you off -- keep your eyes open for the small signs pointing the way. Once we arrived, we were directed into a charming little room, given mint tea and mineral water, while we waited to discuss our selections with the owner. He was extremely informative, and steered us towards the traditional package with a steam, green soap scrub and herbal masque, followed by a massage. There is a place to lock up your clothing and valuables (my husband was worried about this -- he needn't have been!) and you're given paper underpants, a plush robe and slippers. The steam lasted about 20 minutes and took place in an old-world-looking tile-lined room with a domed ceiling. By the time we were completely relaxed, we were scrubbed within an inch of our lives -- very tingly and clean feeling, which was a pleasure after the dust and sand of the souks! Then the herbal masque, which again was extremely relaxing. Then off to another room to rehydrate with mint tea, mineral water and some delish Moroccan cookies! Then on to our massage -- I chose bitter orange scented oil, my husband something more masculine but I can't remember what. The massage lasted for an hour and was blissful.A couple of words of advice: try to do this at the END of your holiday -- it's perfect before having to deal with the hassle of plane travel. There are a number of stairs so if you're disabled, you may wish to check if there is a lift -- I didn't bother since neither of us needed it, but you might want to confirm. Also, book ahead! I called and put down a deposit by PayPal (20 Euros) which was very simple to do since there's free Wifi in all kinds of places around Marrakech. If your hotel/riad doesn't have Wifi, go to the Cyberpark or simply visit a hotel lobby which does offer this. And although my masseuse spoke some English my husband's did not, so it might be helpful to know a few phases, like turn over (\"tourner\"), too hard (\"trop dur\"), not hard enough (\"pas assez dur\"), lower (\"plus bas\"), higher (\"plus haut\") and that's wonderful (\"c'est merveilleux\") -- I guarantee you'll need the last one for sure!If we ever find ourselves back in Marrakech, we'll be going back here for sure. Just wonderful, and worth every dirham. Tip well; it's very inexpensive for what you're getting!"

The moment you enter this spa, you are greeted with mint tea and mint cool water, you are talked through the treatments available and exactly what they involve. Our consultant spoke excellent English and we decided to go for the oasis combo of a hammam and massage. I cannot more highly recommend this spa and our choices! The hammam cleansed us of all the sweat and pollution of a week in the sun and souks, followed by the most magnificent massage I have ever had. The staff are all very skilled and clearly love what they do. As a spa devotee, I must say that this was a fantastic experience."

We were taken to the hammam, my Hamman was done by Malika(??) who was professional and friendly. My sister told me her attendent was also great.Only complaint here was that my short boyfriend was given the 'long' area to lie down and both my head and feet were against the very hot wall which was quite uncomfortable. Not sure if it would have been the same for him but as it was a bday prezzie I didnt complain and make him swap haha.Then you are taken in your robe for mint tea and biscuit to relax before the fantastic massage. Ask for a very hard massage if you are fine with 'regular' western or thai massages as the Moroccan massage technique is quite light.Practically fell asleep at the end of the massage i was so relaxed. All three of us sat in the quiet room post treatments absolutely blissed out. Fantastic afternoon.Clean, friendly and great value for money. Give it a go!"

I first read about it on Tripadvisor and was positive about visiting the spa based on the other reviews. As my wife is a practicing Muslim we requested, prior to our visit, for no men to be present whilst we were utilizing the Spa's services. We received a speedy response and our request was accommodated for. This place already won points before I even visited them!Finding the Spa was slightly difficult but once we got there it was worth very minute. The receptionist was very friendly and attended to our needs. We were provided with sweets and delicious tea which relaxed us when we got to the Spa and the same was provided in between the pampering services. Me and my wife opted to use the Romantic package, which may seem dear in price but is alot better then the other Spas available in Marrakech. The package was phenomenal. The facilities were clean and spotless. The beds were comfortable and the Hammam was an experience on its own. I felt revitalized and relaxed after the package had come to an end and I highly recommend this place to anyone that visits Marrakech. Words cannot even begin to describe how great this place is and the only down point was that we had to leave. My visit to this Spa alone was worth the trip to Marrakech. *Please note, the photos I have attached do not justice to this wonderful place as it does really look better when visiting in person."

It was high on our list of things to do and hence didn't mind spending a little extra for something special. Heritage Spa really delivered on our expectations. My wife and I had a Romance package together (1600 dhs) and we were utterly pampered from start to finish. Time was taken to choose and explain the treatments - particularly so given my wife's pregnancy and then the hammam, massage and treatments were spot on. The mint tea and pastries in between were the icing on the cake. If I were to be picky I'd say there is a little bit of background noise during the treatments due to the spa being a typically compact building within the old medina but that didn't spoil the overall experience. Highly recommended for a couple looking for a touch of self indulgent luxury."

I'd recommend an actual hammam, like the ones that may still be touristy but have segregated sections for men and women and the treatment is more vigorous. It will be more like the traditional Moroccan experience. The massage was great. With the lights low and the mystical music, I was next to asleep. In between the treatments, we sat in a tented area on the roof and had mint tea and cookies. Great touch. So, nice place, but if you want a true-ish hammam experience, try elsewhere.

Prior to our appointment, my husband and I had spent a week walking around Europe and many hours in airports and on airplanes - we were really looking forward to our spa experience. Upon arrival, the manager was very lovely and inviting (and spoke great English). We were treated to delicious mint tea, refreshing water and snacks while we got to choose our massage oils. The spa itself is stunningly beautiful. Everything smells amazing and there is soothing music playing in every corner. The manager explained the hammam and massage process in detail and escorted us to the room where we changed into the disposable undergarments. We then relaxed for a few minutes in comfy robes before we were escorted to our hammam, where we we both exfoiliated from head to toe (even behind the ears!) with lovely soaps and oils and after having our hair washed, we were left to relax with a body masque treatment. I have to admit, as this was our first hammam experience, my husband and I were feeling a bit anxious and modest...but the staff were very respectful and made us feel very comfortable and relaxed. It was pure, luxurious bliss.Following the hammam, we were treated to a head massage and more delicious refreshments. After some more relax time, we were escorted to the massage rooms, were we received relaxation massages with our chosen massage oils. I can say with confidence that this was the best massage I have every had. I was sad when it came to an end!As a helpful note, though there is clear signage for the Heritage Spa, we did have someone (unaffiliated with the spa) offer to escort us to the spa when he saw us looking around the area. Though we declined his offer, he instead walked us to the spa door and then demanded money (30 dirhams). It was quite uncomfortable. Thankfully, the spa manager asked him to leave once we entered the spa. So unless you are truly lost (which should not happen), be sure to avoid these individuals :)I can't recommend this spa experience enough. Probably a good thing that I live in another country as I would be wanting to go to this place every day. Treat yourself and enjoy!"

As expected we were able to enjoy every part of the experience together, except the massage - absolutely fine as not only is that a personal experience anyway, but so relaxing that I wouldn't have batted an eyelid if Queen Elizabeth was getting a back rub next to me wearing her own disposable thong-style pants (provided to all guests to change into)! Overall we were at the Spa for around 2.25 hours, service was impeccable throughout the visit, and were never rushed.I'm not sure a Hammam is really 'my thing' (as you should expect, it's quite vigarous), but I'm pleased to have had the experience in lovely surroundings, and absolutely loved the massage. My partner is the Spa veteran, and thought it one of the best she'd had - high praise indeed! :-) We both felt very relaxed, clean, and refreshed afterwards - a perfect accompaniment to offset the hustle of Marrakesh."

On arrival in this stunning building we were greeted and seated in a plush alcove by a most pleasant young lady, who helped us decide exactly which treatments we desired, offered us a first timers discount and talked us through the entire process in perfect english. We were shown to our changing room, where fluffy robes, slippers, disposable thongs and a safe for our valuables awaited us. We were then introduced to the lovely Amina who ensured that she turned us out to be the cleanest, shiniest people in Marrakech (I wanted to bring her home)! Then we were lead to the Bedouin tent on the roof terrace for minted water, pastries and a relaxing cool off period. This was followed by a most blissful hour long massage. I was surprised that my partner did not fall asleep, however, he said that it would have been sacrilege to miss even a brief moment of this. The entire experience was seamless and wonderful in beautiful surroundings, ending with hugs, lots of smiles and we were given a gift to take away! AMAZING - PURE BLISS!It's a shame that this spa does not have a branch in my hometown! On our return to the riad Hamid asked us how we were, we answered in unison - clean!I would not only recommend it, if I could, I would buy it."

Because the medina can be confusing, a staff met us at a central location and walked us to the spa. We were warmly greeted. Ali took his time to explain all the packages and because we couldn't make up our minds actually chose one for us and charged us at a cheaper price. And what a great recommendation. The hamman experience is AWESOME, every inch of your skin is literally scrubbed. The massage is individualized to your likes. Even the snacks are to die for.On your visit to Morocco, must carve out some time for the hamman at the HERITAGE SPA. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."

We went to this SPA following the trip advisors hints, we are quite usual to come in Marrakech as some friends of us have a house here, so we decided to try a new spa and we arrived at the Heritage spa. Once you get in the SPA you start to feel in a different world, the caos of the medina disappears and your mind starts to relax in a beautiful charateristic riad which has been totally adapted for being a perfect Spa.We had a couple Detox Hamman with Gommage made with the Argan soap and that was really great, we tried at least 30 hamman and gommages during our several journies in marrakech and this has to be put in the top 5 of our experiences.The place is quite easy to find and it is well marked with several signals on the road to the spa.I truly recommend this spa and prices are also quite fair, you will not want to go away.***IF THIS REVIEW WAS HELP FULL PLEASE PUT AN \"i like\" ****Thank you"

We found one of the signage boards and was looking lost when a young chap (presumably employed by the spa) kindly showed us the way. We were given a tour of the spa and booked an appointment for the following day. I was also assured that we would only have lady therapists.My husband and I booked the Destination Marrakech package and it was 2 1/2 hours of complete and utter bliss. The package included a traditional hammam and a one hour massage. When we arrived, we were asked to choose the oil we wanted to use for our massage and if we had any \"problem areas\" for the massage. We were able to have our hammams in the same room (just the two of us). The lady that looked after us (Marika) was delightful and through my broken French and her broken English we managed to communicate and have little jokes too. She was extremely professional and thorough. We were given plenty of time between each process to relax and let the soap/mud/heat do their jobs.After the hammam, we were given tea and biscuits and just chill.For our massages, we had rooms next to each other. It didn't really matter as we weren't going to do much talking anyway! I think the DH fell asleep and actually snored (how embarassing!!)! That was how relaxed he was and he did ask for a relaxing massage! I had asked for a firm massage to get rid of some the kinks in the muscles and she did exactly that. I was totally relaxed but the muscles did get a work out too.We both agreed that it is worth visiting Marrakech just to come to Heritage Spa."

It is a very beautiful riad tucked away inside the medina. On arrival we chose our oils and then the pampering began. We had a hamman/full body massage/facial with seaweed peel off masque/foot massage. It was a totally amazing and relaxing experience and I would recommend Heritage Spa to anyone travelling to Marrakech. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The patchouli and orange blossom perfumes of the soaps they gave to us when we left still fills our bathroom and reminds us of our fabulous day of pampering. Excellent value.

It's not the easiest place to fine, but once you are close, there are signs available to see and guide you. I used the Tripadvisor City App, it worked beautifully.Once inside (look out for the door number to help you locate the actual door - number 40), it is simply beautiful. Looks and feels authentic.

We have been to hammams in London and enjoyed the experience but it was never anything like what we experienced at Heritage Spa. The treatment didn't feel rushed, we were given plenty of time to relax. after the hammam we were taken to a relaxation room for tea and homemade marrocan biscuits. We were then given a selection of oils to smell to choose which one we would like used for our massage.the massage was out of this world, again in a room with two massage beds allowing my partner and i complete privacy. i am sure these ladies do a lot of massages in a day but it felt like it was the only one they had done that day, taking their time...If we had had the time we would have returned a second time to heritage spa... it was so special and delightful."

Coming directly after a return from riding camels in the desert this was very well received.I cannot profess to be an expert in Spa treatments but what stood out to me was that it was a seamless experience. The different aspects were joined up with things like Moroccan tea and biscuits whilst sitting on floor cushions as you dried off from your Hammam. It was also excellent value. The only tiny negative I would say is that the changing area is only able to be used by one person or couple at a time. If there are a lot of bookings then it is pretty rushed to get out - this is ok for men but I would advise women to not expect time to dry hair and put on a full face of make up.All in all though I immediately wanted to book myself in for another one but sadly did not have enough time left!"

We went with the Romantic Couples experience and were treated like Royalty. They managed to fit us in on the same day after being told at another spa that we were too late as it was fully booked. They will come out to the main street if you struggle to find them but it is actually extremely well signposted. Upon entering its like entering another world. The tranquil and calm escape was surreal. We had a Hamman which consists of being scrubbed (whilst wearing paper disposable pants!) like my mother used to do to me when I was a wee small boy! We then relaxed amongst cushions with mint tea and biscuits and soothing music. From here we then had a relaxing massage (you can opt for a stimulating one if you prefer) which was very very good.We cant rate this company highly enough and thoroughly recommend them.Many thanksRob & Karen"

On arrival in Marrakech, we emailed the Spa to check availability. We decided to go for the Heritage Romance package. The replies were prompt and courteous and even helped us with directions to the spa. On arrival, the riad took our breath away. Absolutely beautifully maintained and typically Moroccan . The owner met us with a warm welcome and discussed what would happen. Having a sensitive hip area due to surgery, I was a bit apprehensive with regards to being scrubbed and massaged there, however I needn't have worried. Before I could mention it, the owner asked if we had any sensitive areas and indeed if there were any particular areas that needed extra work during the massage. We were then able to choose our own massage oils and I could decide on a prescription facial to suit my skins needs.We then changed into the disposable underwear and the fun began. It started with the hammam which was simply incredible. As a frequent wearer of fake tan, it was hilarious to see the colour that was scrubbed off me. Every inch, top to toe was cleaned and I also had my hair washed. Afterwards, we were dressed in fluffy robes and hair wrapped in towels and left in a relaxing sitting area with mint tea and some Moroccan biscuits.After a short while, we were taken down for our massage. This was quite simply the best massage I've ever experienced, not at all rushed as if usually the case. The girl, I think her name was Fatima, checked the pressure was ok and thereafter worked her magic. It was total bliss. I could have lay there forever. After my massage, I had a facial which was incredible too. The whole experience was just so relaxing and I left feeling refreshed and squeaky clean. The staff were so attentive and polite from start to finish. It is an expense but its well worth every penny. I would go to Heritage Spa every day if I could!"

We paid 1600 dirhams (total) for a 2.5hr experience which included a full body scrub followed by a full body relaxing massage and finished off with a foot massage for me and facial for my partner. The spa is a short taxi ride away from Jemma El Fna (5 mins 20 dirhams). We were welcomed by the manageress and shown into a relaxation room where the treatments were explained and were able to select our chosen oil for the massage. We were then taken into another room where we changed into a pair of paper pants (boxer style for the guys, thong for the girls) and given dressing gowns and slippers. Next it was into the stone slabs where we were washed, scrubbed and polished. It's amazing the dead skin which actually comes off you!! On completion of that we were shown into a side room where we were given mint tea and 10 mins to relax. We were then walked into our seperate massage rooms where we given the best massage we have both had in a long time. Soothing music, dimmed lights and professional staff made the massage so much more enjoyable. 1600 dirhams for both may seem a bit expensive but for a treat it was more than worth it. If your in Marrakech and thinking about a spa treatment don't miss this place....you won't be disappointed!!"

As an American, I've had quite a bit of massage experience and was curious enough about the hammam to forget my modesty for an hour and give it a try. The spa itself is charming and the service attentive. The manager checked in often to see if everything was meeting expectations. It was, as one reviewer commented, fun to chose my own massage oil fragrance. The bath experience exceeded my expectations in that I have very sensitive, psoriatic skin. I was afraid of so much abrasion but it seems to have actually improved my skin. The 45-minutes sweating on the marble slab was too long for me so I hollered and someone came immediately to finish the procedure.Apparently they are not trained in deep- tissue massage but the manager asked the masseusse to increase the pressure and she did a very good job.Given spas are ranked high on the list of things to do in Marrakech, Heritage Spa was an excellent place to go. Being located in the medina made it even more special."

The gommage was professionally and comprehensively executed by a polite, smiling lady (I hesitate to call her a professional scrubber). After this I got very hot drinking the mint tea which is provided in-between treatments and was carelessly flashing my bits when the charming owner walked in and started chatting away to me in excellent English. My next treatment was a lovely facial (although I'm not sure you can get much shine on an old boot) followed by a foot treatment. This was simply divine, with a lovely massage of my tired pins. I didn't meet any other clients during the 2 hours or so I was there and got the impression that this discretion was deliberate Heritage Spa policy...although I was also left wondering if it was because of my old fashioned methods of cooling off........."

I can't remember being washed so thoroughly by anyone other than my mother when I was a small child. Even being scrubbed behind the ears!After some tea and yummy biscuits we had massages and facials. It was so relaxing that I fell asleep only to be woken by the sound of my own snoring. Opps!Definitely, worth doing a fantastic experience and way to spend our last afternoon in Marrakech."

The total experience was relaxing from choosing the essential oils we preferred to lying in the hammam and being scrubbed, cleaned and buffed - I never realised I was so dirty!! We both had full body massages that were sensational, we both agreed the head and face massage was almost hypnotic as we fell asleep. I highly recommend that you try Heritage Spa it is more than worth the cost and the hospitality is exceptional. You even get an aromatherapy homemade soap to take away. Enjoy!"

Once you do find it you are welcomed and taken through to discuss your treatments and you even get to pick out your oils! The manager spoke great English (my french is terrible so this helped), she explained the procedure. My boyfriend and i went for a couples packages at around 650 dirhams each. Firstly we were lead to the changing rooms where we had to put on the smallest and least attractive pair of paper pants ive seen.. his were funnier.. and a lovely warm fluffy robe and slippers. Then we were taken to the hammam (like sauna but marble instead of wood) where we laid down and were scrubbed head to toe with black soap (all of the dirt that comes off you is amazing - apparently a good idea to do when you first arrive for a improved tan! we waited til we got back from our Sahara camping trip so were even filthier than normal!). Then we were left for 10 mins or so then wash down and hair washed.. i did feel like a child at this point.. mum scrubbing my hair and getting all the grit out from behind my ears.. After the big clean we were taken to a relaxation room and given mint tea to sip on for a bout 15 mins before we were taken for our hour long all over body massage. I really enjoyed this and certainly helped the bad back i had from camping but i will say i don't feel the massaging of the breasts was necessary.. im a brit, we dont like things like that! But it happened and i survived and the rest was amazing.You even get a little bag of smelly dried flowers for your underwear draw at home.. Would definitely go back there again.. You can get the same treatment elsewhere for maybe half but this was well worth the extra \u00a320."

We were soaped, left to relax, scrubbed with a glove, washed, polished with black soap, shampooed and rinsed. Shiny clean bliss! The soaping and scrub were as good as any massage. Afterwards, we were served mint tea and water in a sitting area while we relaxed.This was actually my second time at Heritage Spa, after an excellent pedicure a couple of days ago.Definitely somewhere I'd recommend to any one wanting a bit of pampering."

From the moment you duck through the door you enter a what can only be described as heaven. My wife and I chose the 'Marrakesh experience' which cost 1200 Dirhams (\u00a388) in total and took three hours! It starts with Moroccan tea and deciding which oils to have with the massage, this isn't rushed and sets the scene for the rest of the visit. It's then off for a Hammam (together), for those that arn't sure what this is, it's laying on a heated slab in a hot room. You then get 'soaped up' with black (olive) soap, then exfoliated, then smeared in volcanic mud and finally washed off. The entire experience if fantastic. It's then off to relax and then down through the building for an hour long massage. It is truly awesome and every minute draws you into the ambiance of the Heritage. I have to say, I was only going to have the massage, but so glad my wife talked me into the full monty, to miss it would have been to miss what was one, if not THE, highlight of my trip to Marrakesh. A couple of tips if you do go - Ask the Taxi driver to take you to the Dar Moha restaurant (which you should also try) and get a boy to walk you to the Hertiage (just give him 10 Dirhams, he'll roll his eyes and ask for more, but just smile and pat him on the back, it's just their way). Really don't miss this place . . . you won't forget it, it's a 6 star experience."

I had heard that this spa was also good so i booked the Heritage Romance treatment for 2 people (it cost about \u00a390-this was after speaking to a lady called Antoinne there and getting a discount).We walked through back streets and arrived at a big grand door.Antoinne greeted us , the place was beautiful.We received water with an orange slice in it and then some mint tea - it was so refreshing.Antoinne was so professional and extremely polite.She explained the whole experience to us and we chose the oils we wanted for our massage( this included a hammam each a full body massage for an hour each and then a facial for me and a foot massage for my husband)which compared to london prices was a bargin.In between the hammam and massage we received rose tea - there was a choice of different flavours - and some morrocan sweets. At the end of the treatments we had a rest on the lovely comfortable beds and had more refreshments. The whole experience was amazing i loved it and felt very pampered.Antoinne couldn't do enough for us .

We started with the hammam which was fantastic and then some chill out time with a mint tea (he had Jasmine), it was soooo relaxing. We then went off for the massage, I'm not much good at relaxing and switching off but my massage was so good I was drifting away. Unlike an earlier reviewer who felt the masseurs were not well trained I would totally disagree (and yes, I have had quite a few massages over the years), it was quite perfect.

Our riad recommended Heritage Spa and we booked the spa package for 2, I also opted for a back waxThe spa is off a busy alley near many shops but once you step inside it is peaceful and dimly lit. It was also air conditioned (well it felt cool) which was great after walking in 40 degree heat.We were greeted by the friendly receptionist who explained what would happen and then guided us to our changing room. We were given dressing gowns and slippers and some paper underwear. For women you are just given knickers and for men its pretty much the same. They do not leave much to the imagination and I was very cautious about staying modest.I was guided upstairs for a wax while my friend was taken to a relaxation room. The wax was fine, if a little painful (I am a bit of a wimp) Once the wax was over I was reunited with my friend where we received mint tea and foot and leg massage and a mini face rub. We relaxed for about 10 minutes and then went to have our scrub. We entered into a steam room and were told to lay down. We were both scrubbed head to toe and then showered off.After this we went our separate ways and both received massages. I cant speak for my friend but mine was amazing. I have a problematic shoulder and the masseuse sorted it right out.All in all it was a lovely afternoon and well worth the money. It was 450DH for the massage and 200DH for the wax"

We were quite disappointed by the 1 st massage, one of them was relaxing with pressure it was ok but my husband wanted a deep tissue and it was nothing like a deep tissue.On day 2 our hopes were up because we said we were not fully satisfied but unfortunately the massages were not better, the facial was ok, nothing special and the pedicure was very basic.Overall i wish we had only booked the hammam . We passed our comments on to the owners who totally understood us and gave us a small gift;, i think the therapists are missing some training and if you are used to have good massages dont do it here you will be disappointed.I will repeat that the spa is beautiful, the staff is lovely and the hammam was great."

We had seen this spa reviewed on trip advisor so when te hotel recommended it too we decided to go for it.Owned by a husband and wife team who were so friendly and helpful explaining everything before we started. we booked the Romance couples package which included hammam, scrub, 1 hr massage and then facial for me and foot massage for my husband.Whole appt took 3 and a half hrs and was sheer bliss,excellent value at under \u00a3100 for both for everything.The Spa was much more sophisticated than we expected and we were given fluffy bathrobes,slippers and paper underwear which was more than adequate (see other reviews of spas) we chose our own blend of essential oils for the massage which was heavenly.I would definitely recommend this spa and would come back again. Don't be nervous about trying it as they look after you and it's not rough & ready like some of the cheaper ones. They even gave us a lift back to the main square when we finished as we would have got lost otherwise so they are lovely. Go!!"

It could not have come at a better time and we felt 110% relaxed. Fantastic, friendly staff who explained everything. Skin felt brand new and got a 20% surprise discount at the end! Massage was amazing and it is well worth the price we paid alone. As other reviewers said, spent a good 3 hours there so an excellent way to spend an afternoon before heading out to dinner in one of the many beautiful restaurants."

Even though we were running late for our appointment heritage spa were still very accommodating and we managed to get all the treatments we had booked in for. We decided to go all out and have the Heritage experience which consisted of the hammam with body mask, massage, facial and pedicure. They provided us with robes and disposable underwear as the hammam is very much a full body experience! We were brought to relaxation areas in between treatments and served mint tea and water, the manager stopped by in between our treatments to see how we were doing and explaining about the various treatments. We Just felt thoroughly cleansed from top to toe and extremely relaxed! It does help to have a bit of basic French with the girls who provide the treatments. I couldn't say anything negative about the service or treatments. The only thing that I didn't appreciate was being caught off guard as soon as I came out of the hammam by the girl who treated us asking me for a tip when I had only just come out of the hammam even though i had every intention of leaving a tip once we had completed everything. I don't like it when a tip is asked for, it should be the clients choice. Other than that we did all have a great experience and I would return whenever I go back to Marrakech."

She let us sit down and gave us some drinks before even going into which spa treatment we would like.we chose one of the house specials 'oasis' treatments and we weren't disappointed. From start to finish we were pampered and treated extremely well. All the staff seemed very professional and friendly although being English there was a bit of a language barrier with some of the French speaking staff but this didn't cause any problems. Between the hammam, scrub and hour long relaxIng massage, we were treated to some excellent tasting Morrocon tea (nicer than we have got in the cafes by far) and biscuits. All in all it was an excellent, relaxing experience. I did this with my girlfriend and we had the whole spa to ourselves (I think this is standard in that when you book a treatment you get the whole spa to yourselves for the duration of the treatment but It's worth checking as I dont know if we were just lucky)All in all this spa is a relaxing gem in one of the craziest citys I have been too. Highly recommended"

Everything from the location to the attention was truly an experience in Marrakech. It was fairly easy to find thanks to all the signs leading up to the spa. When we went in, we received immediate attention and were handed a pamphlet with all the different packages offered. We chose to do the hamman and the relax massage treatment. It was perfect because we were not separated at any time. After being in the sun all day it was a huge relief to get all our dead skin scrubbed off. Days later and my skin still feels smooth. Sitting in a tented room drinking Moroccan tea and cold water was very refreshing. Amongst all the relaxation, one of the highlights was the demonstration on how to make the tea we were drinking. We even got to take home some sage and mint for free. I highly recommend this spa to couples and those who wish to get a culture experience and relax for a bit."

After contemplating much on which spa to go, I finally decided to follow my feelings and went to the Heritage Spa I was picked up at my hotel by the owner as I learned that he had to open at 930am for my request. I was so embarrassed but the very charming owner Ali is so hospitable and so kind. Forget about the old surroundings on your way to the spa. The most important thing is the excellent service and the clean treatment, massage and hammam spaces they have. It was so relaxing and my masseuse was so professional and caring. I had a small chat with the owner afterwards over some excellent mint tea and moroccan biscuits. The place reflects the good heart of the owner and his passion for excellent client satisfaction. I will definitely go back. I highly recommend this place as a must visit when you are in Marrakech. I paid about 290MAD for my authentic hammam experience and bought a moisturising cream for 250MAD. Dont forget to tip your masseuse as they really do a good job. Till my next visit..."

After a day visit to the atlas mountains my wife and I decided to give ourselves a treat and spend the afternoon relaxing in the spa.When the taxi dropped us off in the neighbourhood we thought it would be hard to find but thanks to the clear signs on the streets we made it there without a hitch. Once there we were pointed to a waiting room and offered tea. We chose the hammam + massage combo and were given a choice of scented oils for the massage. It was nice to get a treatment room for the both of us and sice It was our first hammam treatment (mud rub) we had a few laughs. The experience of getting washed down takes you back to your baby years!! After chilling for a few minutes in what looked like a \"jaima\" bedouin tent sipping tea and chatting with the manager were taken to the massage room, also acommodating both of us.They turned the lights down and played some relaxing music (a bit loud for my wifes taste) then we both had our hour long massages. Heaven.On our departure we each got a nice scented sachet for our drawers.The staff was very friendly and the manager made sure we were well taken care of throughout our visit. The price was very good, we both got our treatments for the price of a 30 minute massage at our hotel, we were there for almost two hours."

We were then shown to another lounge for tea and water before our massage. The massage was a deception. Two young girls who had no idea what they did massages us, they were chatting away in arabic, they were on their cell phonesand my daughter told me it was really annoying to feel how the masseuse had placed her cellhone between my daughters feet to be able to look at it and respond to incoming messages. My daughter obviously felt the frquency of these text messages as the phone vibrated between her feet! I thought this was extremeley unproffessional. Very disappointing."

We were then taken for our massage, I chose the massage musculaire toubkal, \"expressly for very sporty people\" which was not as expected. Instead of getting into any muscles, it consisted of a strange rubbing process which was almost painful in the excessive friction and the little use of oil. It was a shame, as we had both really been looking forward to our massages, yet following mine, i was in pain for the next few days. On leaving we were asked to give a tripadvisor review, something which i felt really lowered the tone of the place, suggesting that all is important is the ubiquitous rating. "

The quality of the massage was incredible - I felt like i was floating.Soft lighting, lovely traditional low music, air conditioned rooms all add to the experience.This type of treatment, and this quality, would be twice the price in the UK. If you are lucky enough to be going to Marrakesh, you just have to go here. It is truely out of this world.Each and every member of staff is to be congratulated for their professionalism and friendliness, but particular mention must go to Fatima who performed my actual massage - unforgetable."

They supplied - disposable underwear, robes, slippers and your belongings could go in a locker.I was absolutely gutted having injured my foot the day before, thinking i could not do the hammam. However after indicating my foot could not touch water they improvised with a shower cap and tape and water proofed my injury. The hammam lady was an absolute sweetheart making sure im comfortable and being aware of my injury.The masseuse was sooooo kind and accommodating aiding me down the stairs.I could not fault the hospitality of this establishment and the hammam was a breath of fresh air for my skin after sweating in the midst of the dusty vibrant city. The massage was extremely relaxing and tranquil with calming music in the background - the masseuse asked if the pressure was ok too. Whole experience took a little more than 3 hours, so don't go there if you're in a rush! I learnt during my visit that they opened in Dec 2011 and transformed it from a normal house so their facilities and furnishings were all pretty new and really clean.One word of warning though - the masseuse used alot of oil in my hair for head massage so I left with a clean but super greasy hair.I would suggest a dressing table with hair dryers for ladies who wish to put their face back on and fix themselves before embracing marrakech again."

In a shadowy, narrow and isolated alleway (don't be afraid, the owner herself will guide you to your destination), in the heart of the kasbah, this tiny, cute spa will grant you a warm welcome and an intense bit of traditional hamman. You'll rest in a silence nest just a shot from the traffic. We'll come back. We sipped mariage freres tea, eating yummy traditional biscuits!"

Treatments were wonderful, Hammam and massage as i have never done before. The welcome of the owner and the place were also unique. I have visited some spa in Marrakech but this one is really. They have managed the treatments for both of us in a professional manner even we were 11 persons.They have also offered tea and nice cakes. We came back the day after to do face care (only ladies). I recommend to visit."

            "review": "Faultless. I really can't fault our experience at the Heritage Spa. We spent the most wonderful 3 hours here, having the 'Destination Marrakech' treatment, which was a traditional hammam / gommage scrub followed by a 1hr massage. It worked out at \u00a338 each. The spa is probably quite hard to find but we were fortunate enough to be staying in the same locality and had walked past. The building is absolutely beautiful, spotlessly clean and lovely attention to detail with taps, lighting etc. We were directed to a changing room to undress and put on disposable knickers and a fluffy white robe. Once undressed, we went upstairs to the steam room and lay down for a short while. The next hour was spent being showered in warm water, washed in the traditional black soap, scrubbed to within an inch of our lives and then we had a hair wash and scalp massage. I can't really describe how amazing this was. We the sat in a small tented area drinking mint tea and just feeling blissed out! We then went down to have a 1 hour massage (both myself and my friend were treated at the same time), and the spa manager took the time to enquire what type of massage we preferred. This is a one-of-a-kind experience and I'm sad that we couldn't go back the next day and do it all again. I highly recommend this spa-- you get a feel for the traditional hammam experience but in a luxurious environment."

A warm welcome, complimentary tea in a \"tent\" on the roof and a high-quality massage proved us right. This is indeed a beautiful place to visit, and the products used are of very high quality. Definitely to be recommended!"

The spa was down some narrow streets but as well signed as anything in the Medina. The solid door opened into a classic Moroccan interior and they provided towel robes and disposable underwear. The hammam steam room was very hot , with a very vigorous scrum that removed large quantities of grime accumulated in London and Marrakech. After a relaxing mint tea we then had a totally relaxing massage. It was the perfect way to totally unwind after the buzz of the Souks and sightseeing."

It may be easier to find it coming off avenue Mohammed V than through the tiny souk roads. And once you find it you will discover a very pleasant and relaxing treat in the middle of this busy city.Antonina the owner-manager is very accomodating and helps to find the right service out of the extensive spa-hammam-massage menu. We chose a combi-package with hammam/gommage followed by a full body massage.The hammam is nicely outfitted, comfortable and very clean. After this first session we were served tea in the berber-tent style relaxing area before being guided to the massage. The latter is performed in an attractive and well equipped and nicely smelling room.The massage ladies are very friendly locals who know their profession very well.The pricing may be high for local salaries, but is definitely correct for international standards - we paid 490 Dh per person for almost two hours of very enjoyable spa experience.We would go back definitely."

My husband and I had the traditional hammam and massage offering. I thought that we'd be separated but actually were able to share the experience. The facilities were new, clean and luxurious with a traditional Moroccan flair. The ladies who provided our services were pleasant and professional. We also thought they provided a good value. We would (and did) recommend Heritage Spa to other travelers."

It is not rxpe,sive in compariosn to other spa with the same or even lower quality and i am again satified by the hammam and massage.the fact to be in medina is a good experience even i am staying in hotel because it is really a break in the day.don't hesitate."

I have visited some other places in the city but this one is a very good value for the money. Try the hammam with argan soap and drink the famous KUSMI TEA or MARIAGES FRERES for free where as you have to pay (if you foud them) for at least 10 USD. They are proposing several packs. We came back with friends the day after and were also friendly welcomed. Best SPA. John"

The Hammam was excellent, really professional and we both came out feeling amazing. The massage was also good, but we had to cut it slightly short to make it out on time. Great place to experience this."

My all body massage was truly worth the money and certainly hit the spot. We all came feeling truly relaxed and ready for more action.The spa is set in a beautiful Riad which has been recently renovated and is a wonderful, calm setting for an afternoon of pampering."
