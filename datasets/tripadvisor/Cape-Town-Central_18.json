The injustices of the past are high lighted with documentation, artifacts and even a display of old street name plates which reminds one of what was once.a vibrant colourful area. Walk over the old street map on the floor and see what the original layout of District 6 was like. Spend at least a full moring there. Guides are available"

It moved us, inspired us, made us laugh, made us cry but most importantly made us think. Thank you Ruth and district 6 for keeping the memories, good and bad, alive.

Make sure to get a guided tour given by one of the people that were moved out of the District Six by the unjust white supremacist government of South Africa. Our guide walked us through his anecdotes what life was like at the District which was one of the few fully integrated neighborhoods where people lived in harmony. That all ended and people had to move far away from the city just because of their skin color. This museum along with visiting Robben Island are two must visits of anyone wanting to better understand history. This history must never repeat again. Love Trumps Hate"

The SA Police were tasked with tearing down the District 6 'ghetto' in order to split up the Jewish, Coloured, Black and White communities who were happily living together. The land itself has been left empty and derelict for decades while court case after court case has progressed through the South African Courts for recompense to the previous dwellers. The general view is that the Government have stretched out the legal arguments for decades so that the previous inhabitants will gradually die of old age, which is precisely what has happened. A fitting and lasting reminder of the bad old days of Apartheid."

We started a tour in District 6 in which the government of 1966 decided should be a \"white\" neighborhood, so demolished the whole district and moved the people to the \"townships\" where they had to apply to get passes to be allowed to come to town; they were not allowed to own property, and had to pay for the trains that brought them in to work in the city. The museum was one of the buildings that was not destroyed and was full of pictures and artefacts of the area and is staffed by residents who lived there before it the area was demolished.

My family and I entered the museum and we could not figure out how to get such a guide. The person at the front desk didn't look up from her phone and just told us to look around on our own. My kids couldn't figure out what the museum was about. OK, I concede that you can figure out what the museum is about if you are willing to read -- A LOT, but my teenagers don't fall into that category. I knew some things about District Six because I read about it online before coming, the museum didn't teach me anything I didn't already know from reading Wikipedia."

Our guide was Ruth. She's very lovely and has good sense of humor. She shared us what her family did experience during the apartheid. It was so sad that these people did experience all of these. When she started telling us the story of what her family has experience. I can help but feel remorse to the people who did these and to all the family that were removed from their homes.I can't even comprehend why people can be so cruel because of someone's color. As they say, their history is still being written and they have a long way to go but they make sure that the history will not repeat itself. Ruth even said that \"She need to forget the past to have a brighter future\" What I love about this place, the people remain so positive despite of what had happen to them. I highly recommend everyone to visit this place. you'll have more appreciation of the place. It can even change yourself for the better."

I was fortunate to have a friend who lives in Noordhoek inform me of the museum earlier, as it's not that well-known to tourists.

This wonderful museum is a tribute to the 60,000 men, women & children of District 6 who were forcibly removed from their homes, their social networks, their livelihoods, their culture. For the many visitors, like myself, unaware of this dark episode in relatively recent SA history it is a real eye-opener. Still, it is a story being repeated around the world today, not the least in my own backyard when this visit made me think about the forced relocation of the aged and long time residents in Millers Point in the historic Rocks area of Sydney. Different in scale on all levels to D6, but the same in our loss of such an important part of our historic fabric but never even to be remembered in a museum. But back to the D6 museum: to read the history of the area, to read the personal stories, to view the wonderful photographs of the residents at work, at school, at play, in their family groups and to meet some of the former residents is to start to realise what has been lost. The bulldozing of the homes and businesses and the dispersion of it's families has effectively been a cultural and social genocide. I only hope that the move to have D6 developed into a Memorial Park is successful. And no, I'm not your typical bleeding heart, but I found my visit to the Museum extremely moving."

But little has been done 20 years later, and the story does not complete this circle."

It's the story of everyone, really, but they limit the story to what happened in this small neighborhood. The displays and presentation were extremely good. Relevant today, and the content would appeal to cross generational / cross-cultural audiences. I even bought the small book and READ it (I'm astounded, even). Finally ... it wasn't a total bummer. I couldn't live through hearing about Steven Biko's final hours over and over. It's just too much and too hard. This is sad, but not devastating. I got a lot out of how diverse District Six was and ... was lifted up by that."

This well designed and deeply personal museum is a detailed overview of how one lively and close knit multicultural neighbourhood was destroyed and dispersed due to apartheid and Cape Town municipality's plan to build a physical 'buffer' between the white urban areas and the coloured areas. The tragedy is that the great plans the city had for this 'vacated' land never came to be. All was for not. Now former neighbours of District 6 are seeking compensation. This museum tells the fascinating stories of these neighbours who created this unique community. One story I remembered reading about was those people who created local hair salons. Some of the items like homemade curlers and brushes were so inventively created. The overall design of the museum feels like a cross between a regular museum and a personal homemade community potpourri of household items and memories. Loved the recreation of a real family's district 6 home."

They say only the winners get to write history. This museum shows you what it looks like from the other side. Be prepared to listed to personal stories, cry, hold hands with strangers, hug and kiss them as they tell their stories of violent removal, displacement, fear, loss, and pain.

The focus is on the many individuals who made District Six such a rich multicultural community and the heart-ache caused when people had to leave there homes and be transported miles away from the areas and people they had always known.

One of the things history endows us with is humanity - the power to look at ourselves and learn from our mistakes and correct them for a better tomorrow. The District 6 Museum is one of those museums that not only educate and give us a lesson in the past but most importantly it helps us learn to better ourselves as a human race by teaching us about the infractions of the past and we can transcend these."

This museum explains the forced removal of people from District Six in Cape Town during the 1960s, there are sections which highlight different aspects of the lives of the community (their work, music, hairdressers...!) which really helps you to relate to the community that lived there and their way of life, and the devastation of the removals.They also offer tours guided by an ex-resident of District Six who lived through the removals. I'd highly recommend this. You get to see the local area and get a feel for how it was and how it is now as well as getting a personal insight into what happened.Overall I felt this museum and tour gave an excellent insight into the era of apartheid (even more than a visit to Robben Island) as well as a feeling of positivity to the future as the community came together to share their memories of the District not only with each other but with us too.The cafe there is also amazing, my friend and I got given nicknames by the lovely lady here within a minute of arrival! Bobotie wraps definitely worth a try (delicious Cape Malay food!) as well as the traditional koeksisters wrapped in coconut. Such a friendly place and we left as friends (if not family!)."

The museum itself is not large - but its contents are and its story is powerful. It is something that every visitor to South Africa would benefit from seeing.I once went to a concentration camp. That was a mind-numbing experience, and of course not comparable to here. But, at the gates of that camp, there is a statue with a two-word message at the bottom which I believe does apply.

It describes the destruction of a vibrant community, known as \"District Six\" during the Apartheid era. It describes the strong sense of community among the many thousands of people who lived in District Six prior to the bulldozers. It also describes the dreams of some how bringing that community back. What struck me the most, however, were the similarities to \"urban renewal\" projects in the United States at about the same time (1960's 70's). Destruction of vibrant communities in the name of removing so-called \"slums\", replaced with highways, or massive, inhumane housing projects, often permanently displacing people who had no means of fighting for their rights. While the US didnt have the official policies of apartheid, the usually well-intentioned urban projects had similar effects of displacement and disenfranchisement. This museum opened my eyes to what was happening in South Africa during this period, but also caused me to be more introspective about my own country. A Tiny museum, but, think of the impact."

So best to do a little internet searching first to familiarize yourself with what District Six was.The museum covers the area called District Six in Cape Town which was where most black and colored people lived before the government declared the area white only in the late 60's and forced everybody to move out of their homes. The museum itself mostly is about the life of the people who were living in this area before they were forced out and worth the visit to get an understanding of life in Cape Town. Most of the exhibits are pictures and written accounts but there are some pieces that have been donated as well.

Its not really a interesting museum if you compare it with the \u201cnormal kind\u201d they have no museology and everything looks more like a sketchbook of memories. You can look around while talking to an ex resident from district 6 and then things get a lot more interesting. If you are lucky you will get some really nice personal stories."

Not because it has interactive media displays. But because it provides a detailed snapshot of life under apartheid and the very high cost paid as a result. The vibrant, lively and mixed community of the area known as District Six was bulldozed to the ground by the worst of the old, oppressive regime that controlled all life in South Africa. Despite this horrendous and brutal act the lives and personalities of the community that made up the District are vividly conveyed in the words and photographs on display in this small museum. Take the time to visit and you will be richly rewarded and, hopefully, deeply moved."

The Museum is a time-machine back to that era. It is filled with old news clippings on the walls, pictures of the inhabitants, and the history of District Six. There are several guides to answer questions and presentations for children and adults. I believe, not sure, that the admission price is 10-20 rand. It is well worth the visit. Parking is adequate, but a word of caution about the Museum. It does not allow flash photography, although pictures are allowed. I had just purchased a new camera and couldn't figure out how to turn off the flash. :)"

It is very well done through recorded interview, testimonials, photos, newspaper articles etc. a mock up of the living conditions really sets the scene of how black people were forced to moved from their homes, then the area was raised to the ground for the benefit of white South African people. We were advised by a friend to get one of the volunteers who had first hand experience to do the tour with us but there was no one available, even so we spent well over an hour reading the information and looking at all the photographs that tell the story. The coffee shop was in the process of being revamped but still a welcome sit down and a nice cup of coffee. Very easy to find if you are facing the City Hall where Nelson Mandela made his first speech as a free man. Turn left and walk to the first 'robot' (traffic lights) then turn right up this street. The Muesum is 3 blocks up on your right."

It's a small space and most of the exhibits are text with a few accompanying pictures, mainly family photos. The first floor gives a semi-detailed account of what happened, but it's crowded and difficult to take in when even a small group of people enter at the same time. The upstairs area gives more personal accounts of it was like before the families were driven out but it becomes slightly repetitive. In my opinion, this seems like it would be an incredibly moving experience for people with direct ties to District Six while it's merely a quick stop for visitors. I think it's a good stop for anyone, as long as you have a good expectation of what you'll be seeing. The entrance fee is extremely reasonable and I'm glad to contribute to their growth."

You can pay slightly more for a local guide to show you around - which was definitely the way to get the most out of the experience.It is a really moving place to go and see, and when you hear the personal accounts of what happened it really brings home to you what happened not that long ago.A must see in Cape Town."

The city hop on-hop off yellow route stops nearby so it's easy to get to and the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. District Six is the biggest scar left from apartied and the museum has photos, exhibits and real stories that clearly describe what happened and how as a designated 'white' area everyone else had to leave the area to townships further out of the city. It was very sad, but it also is a real reminder of just how far South Africa has come in terms of forgiveness, celebrating diversity and building hope."

Others have talked about the history of District 6 (racially mixed community that was razed by the South African government in the 1960s) and you will certainly learn a lot about that history here. But the most important thing about this museum is the personal aspects that are highlighted: testimony from people whose houses were taken from them and destroyed, remembrances by former residents of the life and spirit of the District 6 community. There is a lot to read, that's true. But even a cursory visit, reading different testimonials as you make your way around the building, would be enlightening. Combine this with a drive around the current area of the old District 6 to see what the government did -- and is trying to do now to rebuild the area. It is too easy to read about the evils of apartheid at a 50,000 foot level and then move on. These stories are so individual and personal that it makes that horrible period come to life. A very rewarding visit!"

For those of us who have only a general understanding of South Africa's apartheid period, here's a succinct way to come to an understanding on a more personal level. Prioir to the era of apartheid, District Six was an area close to downtown Cape Town that was inhabited by a diverse and generally harmonious community of people -- black, colored (SA's term for those of mixed race), Asians, whites, Indians, for the most part. When apartheid was instituted, District six was slated for demolition; it's 66,000 inhabitants were forcibly removed in the 1960's, with no compensation for their homes, businesses or other real estate assets. Only today is compensation being worked out as part of SA's attempt to deal with its past. Having earlier had a tour guide who had lived in District Six as a child, our interest was piqued and we made it a point to visit The District Six Museum on our own. WE ARE SO GLAD WE DID! Through photo's, quotes, film, and graphic presentations, the tragedy of apartheid and the death of District Six comes to life before you here. It's a meaningful visit, a valuable lesson, and helps provide a better understanding of what South Africa was and is becoming. Highly recommended!"

They were a mixture of every colour and creed who lived together in a cohesive and largely harmonious community, Their homes were bulldozed. At this time only a handful have returned.

Got a little lost, but that's always fun in a city, and the sign outside on the pavement wasn't too obvious, but I'm glad I persevered.As previous reviewers have described, it's in an old church with a wide gallery upstairs. It's an amateurish exhibition and I mean that in a very positive way. It's not slick and flashy with interactive electronic screens and the like, but full of basic information presented in a reasonably clear and unfussy manner.I was familiar with the District Six story, so I was more interested in the photos and artifacts upstairs that showed residents before the forced removals. Putting faces to the numbers makes a big difference, and looking at the school children, factory workers, hairdressers, laundresses, musicians etc. helped me realise the true impact of this awful event. I was particularly impressed by an account from one woman who described having to leave a thriving neighbourhood where work, education, entertainment, church and family were all close by. They were all dumped out in the Flats with absolutely no community life or structure, so having to travel by bus or car to get anywhere. Does this sound familiar in UK sink estates and the US Projects?There was a register book of all the District Six addresses that was reserved for comments from ex-residents, and it was fascinating to see the updates and names that had been added comparatively recently. So this is not just a museum for tourists, but for people who have a strong link to one of the most shameful events in South Africa's history. I was very glad to have experienced it and would recommend this to anyone who wants to understand the human impact of racially charged politics and perhaps the reason that Cape Town is still a fascinating and vibrant city."

Apartheid is a huge topic to cover in one museum: the Apartheid Museum in Jo'burg, for instance, is great but skims over certain topics and could easily be twice as big. District Six Museum just examines one particular episode of apartheid, namely the forced eviction of residents in District Six in Cape Town from the 1960s to the 1980s. It details the history of the area and tells many stories about various residents and their struggle against apartheid. Some of the former residents are on hand to talk about their lives and attempts to recover their property.My only reason for not giving an additional star is that the museum could be more interactive - there is a lot of literature on the walls but no film clips, and it would have been nice to have made it more wheelchair/pram accessible (you have to walk up stairs to enter the museum and there is a second floor but no lift/elevator)."

However, for those of you who have visited the Jo\u2019burg museum, you may be somewhat disappointed by the comparatively small scope of the story that the District 6 Museum has to tell. In spite of the relative smallness of the story, I did, in fact, find my time at the museum to be well spent. The personal stories and reminiscences of how individuals and families were uprooted by the government under apartheid were very moving and poignant."

I lot of people have commented that unless you already know a bit about it, you won't learn much from the museum. This is half true - you will learn something new, but without context some of it will be lost. There are books on sale in the museum shop which make for some good retrospective reading after your visit.I arrived at District Six by going on one of those City Sightseeing tour busses with the audio commentary. Leading up to the museum the commentary provided some information about the area and its history, and when you get back on the bus the commentary continues as you travel out of the area. I know some people have a problem with 'being a tourist' and would rather experience other cultures by doing as locals do, but you really do learn a lot from the tour busses, and you cover a large area by doing so. In short - yes the museum is worth a visit, but do some research beforehand."

The church itself is very beautiful and is a stark reminder of the vibrant community that would have worshiped in its walls before they were forcibly removed. Because the museum is small, it's very easy to navigate on your own, although I was visiting with friends from Cape Town and they knew one of the tour guides from playing in bands together. Joe led us around the first floor of the museum, explained some of the exhibits and shared his own memories from growing up in the neighborhood (and playing music there). I was nervous about visiting Cape Town because of the ever-present history of apartheid (I wasn't sure how it would feel to be a tourist there). Visiting the museum helps contextualize not only the apartheid regime but also the way the physical lay-out of the city was purposefully designed to enforce apartheid. As you view District 6 now (there is still very little built on the razed land) and then travel the highways around the City Bowl and out into the Cape Flats, again, you can see the ways in which neighborhoods were manipulated and separated during that time. On a visit to Robben Island the next day, I was lucky enough to chat with a grandmother, mother and daughter. As we were chatting and I mentioned that I had visited the District 6 museum the day before, the grandmother noted that she was married in the church where the museum is now housed. Her family were residents of District 6 before they were forcibly removed. It was really special to have been able to meet her and her family, and I'm thankful for her willingness to share with me."

I don't want to down play the importance of this museum but I think there needs to be something more to the museum for people to completely understand why District Six is so important.Downstairs seems to explain the boundaries of District Six, along with the timeline.Upstairs has artefacts from the era and explains a little how they are slowly reclaiming their original land."

There seems to be little effort at organising themes and the prevailing mood is no more than a wish to return to the old days of street gangs, shebeens, drug-lords and despondency.The exhibits themselves are not very inspiring: mainly old street signs, maps, newsprint and faded snapshots to prove how terrible it all was when the shanty-town was eventually torn down. Not much seems to point to a better future and what the community is doing apart from trying to collect grants and hand-outs..Nowhere is the visitor reminded that District 6 was far from unique. Towns are torn down all over the world on a daily basis, many of them for so-called political reasons. The truly remarkable stories are about how communities rebuild themselves successfully. Now that would be a museum worth seeing. Until then may I suggest making more fruitful use of your time?"

I found the lay-out very interesting, if a bit 'busy' in some places. Lots to read and lots to see. It is not a big museum, but allow enough time. On arrival, the lady at reception told us about the video being shown at the back and sat down to watch it for a while. One of the old residents (who is also a guide and used to be a prominent community member) started talking to us there and we went happily along with him as he told us a few stories. He was not pushy, just sweet and very talkative. After a little while he left us to go to mosque and we continued on our own. I appreciate it that the community is part of the museum; it makes it a very personal experience. The map on the floor showing the previous location of houses of the various families is extremely poignant. The portrayals of community life is very informative as is the date line on the first floor. The shop is great, especially with many books being on sale as well as various memorabilia; not overly expensive either which is refreshing. You can book a tour with a guide, otherwise, just wander around on your own. Well worth a visit."

At the end of the tour (we didn't get a chance to read any of the material on the walls), he shook a container at us and insisted that we put money into it.I think that having been left to my own devices to explore and read at my own pace would have been more beneficial, and would have had me feeling more positive.

But I think visitors who did not personally experience the destruction of the vibrant District 6 community, with its harmonious mixture of races and the close ties among the residents, would find the offshoot museum satisfying and informative. This offshoot is more of a community space in which former residents can meet and stage productions for each other. The large room is festooned with banners giving the history of the old district, with a video area where you can sit and watch the same former resident who met with us give his spiel for the camera. I was taken by this dignified older gentleman, who gave his time tom our group and answered questions. There is also a little gift and book shop."

The District Six museum is tightly focused on the forced removal of 60,000 people and the bulldozing of their homes in this diverse Cape Town neighborhood between 1966 and 1982. The area was never rebuilt and is still largely undeveloped. Because of its focus on purely local history--there's a large street map covering the ground floor on which former residents have written their names where their houses were located, for instance, and exhibits include old street name plates, photographs and newspaper stories from the area/period--the museum's smallness and focus becomes a strength. The District Six Museum's tight focus on the local and specific provides a powerful glimpse into the arbitrariness and evil of the Apartheid system as a whole."

Houses were bulldozed and families were displaced. It was a very sad time in the history of Cape Town, but something that needs to be remembered. Displays at the District Six Museum include original street signs, many handmade quilts created in the words of families who were forced to leave the area, and a re-created room in memory of residents of District Six.It was emotional for me, but something I am so glad I had an opportunity to do."

We could not help thinking of the slum clearance schemes in post war England, the communities hated these schemes, hated being uprooted from their past but it was being done with the hope of giving families a better life. How much worse it must have been in District Six when communities were destroyed for such an awful reason."

Slavery came with the earliest presence of Western influence to this part of Africa and will take many years to move beyond, despite the political changes. This small building is a good touch point to help calibrate ones view of this history. In some ways this was better or maybe a good compliment to the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg?"

My husband and I decided to visit the District Six Museum while on the City Sightseeing Bus Tour, as the museum was a stop along the way. The entire history of District Six is very interesting, but I thought the museum left a bit to be desired. In my opinion it was not very well curated and it was not clear to me which exhibit to visit first or essentially where to start and then how to navigate through the rest of the content. The material also seemed to be more focused on sharing the stories of individuals who lived during that time period which is great, but it would have helped to have more background before reading those histories. Much of the print in museum was very small and difficult to read if there was a crowd around that particular exhibit. The physical signs, objects, maps, etc. that are housed in the museum were a highlight for me. The cost of entrance was only about USD 3 so this museum is worth visiting if you have some extra time."

Only when we visited the museum did we get a sense for what was lost. The museum is in an old building that survived the destruction of the time. The exhibits can be seen in under an hour if pressed for time, but much more time is needed to fully comprehend the enormity of what happened in this once bustling, multiracial neighborhood. There are touching written histories from the people who survived the demolitions, newspaper accounts of the time, and, heartbreakingly, a wooden bench with the sign \"For Europeans Only\". There was a photographic display of several families who lived in the area, Italians, Blacks, Indians and Malays, with written descriptions of life before and after. Life was never the same, neighbors and friends lost, an entire web of life destroyed. There are copies of identity cards that were required of all South Africans that prominently show one's race, and that was emotionally difficult to see.The museum challenges the way we think about maps and who gets to make them, about race, about community and shared history. I think it could be improved by having survivors there to tell their stories to visitors in person, or by video or invite the recording of oral histories. Shockingly, the land of District 6 was never developed after the destruction. Why? I understand that there was a dispute, but what kind of dispute? Is it being resolved? These are questions that the museum could provide answers to, at least more clearly than I could gather from my visit. Some of the exhibits were difficult to make out, with writing in bas relief on white walls in a small room upstairs so I felt I was missing something.It is an important part of history to know something about, and reflect on what happened there so it never happens again. An important place to visit."

It does not have a carefully selected object that makes each point; it has every object that someone wanted to donate.

I understand that in a country like South Africa with its poverty, unemployment and crime; spending on cultural institutions like this one is way down on the list of priorities. Still, it\u2019s a pity to see this interesting place stagnate. Yes it still looks almost exactly like it did 11 years ago but that\u2019s just the problem. It\u2019s frozen in time. Nothing has changed, nothing has been updated. There are no current exhibitions and from the look of it there hasn\u2019t been one for a while. All the quotes you\u2019ll see on the walls, from former politicians, activists and residents seem to have stopped around 1999.If you look at the museum\u2019s website for example, you\u2019ll see that the last \u201cpast event\u201d was a public lecture in Feb 2011 and the latest Annual Report is from 2008. There is nothing under \u201cNews and events\u201d.But still, if you\u2019re interested in the history of this country and this city, it\u2019s worth a visit. These guys want people to hear their stories and they need money to fill their coffers. And it costs only R30 to enter (at June 2013) which is the equivalent of $US3. The museum tells the story of a once mixed race part of Cape Town, which was known as District 6. Now don\u2019t ask me about Districts 1-5 and so on: I asked the curator and even he didn\u2019t seem to know, so let\u2019s assume that the districts of the city were numbered and this one was number 6. But it was a particularly vibrant and colourful part of the city, albeit a tad seedy and run-down in later years. It became famous (or notorious) because the apartheid-era authorities decided in the 1970s, in the interests of keeping the inner city white, to dismantle the whole place i.e. bulldoze it into the ground and move the coloured and black inhabitants to outlying areas of the city. Despite protests the scheme went ahead: District 6 was demolished and the residents forcibly moved out. Yet another indignity suffered by black people during the Apartheid years. The exclusive white suburb that was supposed to rise from the ashes of the old District 6 never got off the ground mainly due to the stigma attached to the area because of the way in which it was destroyed.Today, I\u2019m told, that former residents are attempting to reclaim the area and move back to where they once lived. But however that pans out, sadly, the once lively and bustling District 6 is gone forever. Only its memory lives on in this place.The story of D6 is told in old photos, newspaper cuttings, quotes and wall charts with timelines. Generally it\u2019s a bit higgledy-piggledy and there\u2019s a lot of information to read and digest, some of it in very small print which makes it even harder. The best way to deal with it is simply to wander around just reading and looking. There are only two levels which you can cover in less than two hours. Don\u2019t try to follow it in a logical sequence because it doesn\u2019t work like that. The building housing the museum was originally constructed as a wine store, but was for many years used as a church until it was transformed into this museum in 1994. That was when optimism and hope were at their peak in the newly democratic South Africa. There is a little caf\u00e9 and a tiny shop selling a few books and postcards but not much else. On the day I visited, the caf\u00e9 looked deserted and slightly forlorn.If you\u2019re a tourist in the city, the best way to get here is by taxi but just be aware that it isn\u2019t the most savoury part of town so caution (as always when travelling in South Africa) is recommended. It\u2019s best to leave your valuables, credit cards, travel docs etc at your hotel and just have with you a small amount of cash. After visiting here, you can walk into the city centre in about 15 minutes and have a look around places like the St Georges Mall and Greenmarket Square, but generally the city centre doesn\u2019t have a huge amount to recommend it and always be alert and aware."

We had seen the empty fields and hills in Cape Town, and asked our guide to take us to District Six Museum to find out more of the story. The Museum is housed in one of the churches of the area, and tells the story of more than 60 000 black, colored, and white inhabitants of the area who were forcibly moved out from 1960 to 1982 to try and enforce the Apartheid Policy. The stories are told by the former inhabitants along with photos and objects from the time. This is a simple display but tells a very moving story."

Stopped here from the hop-on/hop-off bus, and felt that i didn't get the most out of the time there since i rushed through to try and see everything. When you enter and pay, the man does tell you the general flow that people take to view the museum, but i found that the entire layout was very random, making it difficult to fully absorb everything. Going in with minimal knowledge, I hoped there would be more about apartheid in general, in a broader sense (maybe the Apartheid Museum in Joburg would be better for that?) Still, it was really moving to see the direct impact on the specific community. I really appreciated the newspaper headlines and article clippings, the numerous interview excerpts as well as the \"Homing Pigeon's View of Forced Removals\" which is found on the wall along the stairwell at the right when you enter (if i remember correctly). The upstairs side exhibits seemed to be slightly disjointed from the downstairs, although i really enjoyed the room that was \"filled with the cement\". Due to time restriction, I ended up taking photos of most of the text so I could read it later. Definitely give yourself more than an hour's time to visit, minimum. The more you know about the history of apartheid before you go, the more you can concentrate and appreciate the amazing resource of information and history they have there at District Six."

District 6 in Cape Town was once a bustling inner city area of about 60,000 near the city docks, that housed blacks, some mixed race people, Asians and early on, a large Jewish population. However, because of the national law of apartheid, the area was designated for whiles only in 1966, so removal of everyone living there began in 1968. Eventually, almost every house in the district was bulldozed and cleared out. Many of the churches were spared as well as a few homes. After apartheid there has been some construction, but basically, right now, it is a ghost town--a large empty area that is a reminder of apartheid. There are roads through it and some people live there. We went as part of a cultural tour of Cape Town, that included Langha and some shantytowns. It is a significant part of South African history. There is also a District 6 museum in Cape Town and the SA Jewish Museum has a current exhibit on the Jews in Dictrict 6--those who lived there in the first half of the 20th centrury."

We spent about 1 to 1 1/2 hr and thought it a good presentation of what District 6 was like as a bustling alive neighborhood before the bulldozers came in and everyone was removed to the \"flats\". We had been to Robben Island and read some books about the struggles, so this was a nice visual presentation to bring it to life. Quotations from the many people who had been removed, and their descendants, was impressive."

As others have said there was not a lot of direction, rather a jumble of images and artifacts on a community uprooted during apartheid. There are tours however we chose to go through on our own. Without condoning the old system in South Africa were were hoping to at least find one 'positive' story regarding the thousands who were forcibly evicted.If you only have a few days in Cape Town there are many more interesting things to do but for those with extra time it is an easy addition."

If you want a real feel for the injustices that the people of the Cape endured simply by virtue of the colour of their skin, you need to read the testimony and look at the photos that are on the walls for you to see. It's a little school-like in the way it's done, but you get a feeling that real people recorded their experience for others to learn from. My teenage boys quietly spent an hour with me there- not a word until we left and then dozens of questions, just as a museum visit should be. And if it's a wet day, as it was for me, no better way of passing some time in the middle of the town. Another reviewer said a book would have done the same job; I disagree. I will be surprised though, if this museum does not make you want to read more about the subject."

Then the apartheid city counsel declared it a \"white-only\" neighborhood and dispossesed the Africans, Coloreds and mixed races to the Cape Town Flats slum.District 6 was razed and replaced by apartment blocks in what would be charitably described as neo-soviet architecture. I walked in and the museum is mostly a collection of photographs and newspaper articles. After all, the area was destroyed and there are not many artifacts left.

The destruction of a multicultural community by apartheid is a tragic story, and the area has yet to fully recover. The District 6 Museum is an effort at reconciliation and renewal for the city, and its narrative is well done here."

While the message the District Six Museum represents is an important issue and topic, this is a poorly-curated museum with almost no context for what it presents. The museum starts off promisingly enough on the ground floor, but as soon as I went upstairs to the main exhibition, I lost the message. For instance, there are old pictures lining the entire museum....but with no dates. That was more than a little annoying when a bunch of pictures from the 50s or 60s are presented without captions and without dates. What am I, as so me one there to learn, supposed to take away? You end up just blowing through what they have there. Another example is a mock sign-up book for people who used to live in Disrict Six...at least, that's what I *think* it was. It was presented with no caption or context.\u00a0I also felt this museum was a bit biased, which perhaps is understandable. The narrative given was that District Six -- before it was labeled white-only -- was a paradigm of black culture and living. But then newspaper clippings at the end of the museum tour described District Six as a crime-infested slum that had no hope. Where was that side of the story in the museum? When I read that, I naturally second-guessed all the stuff I had just walked through as revisionist history. This museum is trying to make out District Six like it's Harlem, ...and it's not Harlem.\u00a0Also, the museum (which is basically one large two-story room) has very poor air circulation and was very hot. This distracts from the overall experience and reading when you just walk to the museum and then are hot throughout. A few fans strategically placed would have made it more enjoyable on a physical level.\u00a0Judging this as a museum and taking out the backstory, I would say this museum needs a lot of work -- and that's sad. I would recommend it mostly because there isn't a similar museum on this topic, but that's the only reason. This is not a museum with Western standards.\u00a0"

Firstly, it's not easy to find because there's another 'district 6' building just down the street which shows exhibitions, I believe. Anyway, took us 20 minutes to find the right place after we accidentally bumped into one of the workers. She did reassure us that they were aware of the confusion of location and were going to address it in due time. Now, to the museum. There is a lot going on visually, which I found to be distracting despite being a visual person. The walls (and floors) had lots of text surrounded by pictures/items and everything seemed crammed into the small, two floors of the building. it lacked a flow, and without a guide, just became overwhelming. It did seem like a wonderful place for those who have close ties to the area, as there were many memorials for them, which was a nice touch. We probably spent a total of 15 minutes before we left in a daze. If you go, try to find a guide or at least take a tour of the area for a more personal touch. I found the website to be more informational and interactive than the museum!"

I thought I had posted a review of my visit previously, but now realise that I didn't - I actually visited prior to March 2011 but I cannot record the actual date.I'm not aware if this is a 'must' on the Cape town historical route. I had read about District Six previously and when someone told me about the museum, I felt I had to visit. There is something poignant about 'family' museums, ones that eloquently tell a simply store without too much razzmatazz. The 'ethnic clearing' of this part of Cape Town in the 1970s was nothing short of heinous. It was on a par with forced resettlement in parts of Germany/Poland during WWII.From the street signs preserved on the walls, to the extensive family histories and material belongings on display, it's a very, very sad place to see another (recent, I hasten to add) example of how man can be so cruel to their fellow humans.But there is hope. There are plans to rejuvenate the original area, although I think that has run into some political issues. Indeed, you can still walk the streets on the hillside that overlooks Table Mountain and wonder about a vibrant community that once lived there. (According to Wikipedia, the official area is 'bounded by Sir Lowry Road on the north, Tennant Road to the west, De Waal Drive on the south and Cambridge Street to the east.')As a museum, it's more important to visit and absorb its history than taking the cable car up the mountain ...."

This focus on placing individuals within the historical context both helps the visitors to realize how recently the events depicted took place and prevents the visitors from being able to distance themselves from those involved.

Very simple museum but it really captured the human experience when District Six was razed. The country's history of apartheid is easily ignored when enjoying the stunning views of the mountains and ocean- this museum was a necesary stop."

Amongst all the many attractions of Cape Town, do visit this small and modest museum which reflects gently but so powerfully on South Africa's divided past. It brings home the the day to day dreadfulness of the apartheid system even more than the trip to Robben Island."

            "review": "Great topic, above average museum. The topic for the District Six Museum is another \"must\" for understanding the history of South Africa. The Group Areas Act is part of a bygone era. This is definitely a good thing, and I applaud the museum for going to great lengths to keep the memory of District Six alive.However, as a museum I think it has its faults. The District Six museum reminds me of the Checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin. I would imagine that private donations and entrance fees cover most of the assistance for the place, and they don't have a group of professional historians to smooth things over and make the museum organized and cohesive. You will find information here that you need, it just may take a while longer than at a \"professional\" museum. The layout is a bit disorganized, but the trade-off is a bit of authenticity and warmth that you may be missing at a more proficient museum such as the Gold museum.I won't give it a 3/5 on principle, but the disorganization brings it down a notch."

How would it be today? The museum it self is small enough to visit in max couple of hours. A lot to see, and even experience."

I would really have liked to stay there longer, as I did not have enough time to read and see all I wanted to. The township tour was an excellent way to see how many people live. It gave me a greater insight into South Africa today and how bad things were in apartheid days. District Six was demolished because black people were too close to the posh white parts of Cape Town. It commemorates the feelings of the people whose homes were flattened, and community destroyed."

But it's really well worth visiting, giving you a real feeling for what the place was like before Apartheid, the damage done by relocations, and the feelings of people in coming to terms with it. It will give you a real insight into modern South Africa - I'd say don't miss it!"
