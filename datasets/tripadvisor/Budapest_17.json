It wasn't a planned thing, we were wandering from the bridge to the Buda castle and just decided to give it a whirl. It was beautiful and fun!There are tons of little park spots to break that seem like old battlements or are very picturesque. Some have slides and playgrounds type things for kids. Particularly pretty in September. The trails that face the river are the busiest and you can avoid most of that by taking the paths up that are most to the middle or other side. There are tons of paths. On the north side you can make your way down to the roads and cross to get to Buda as well. Statues at the top were cool as well. Bring water, although there are some stands on the north side of the top that sell ice cream and drinks. There's a toilet behind them as well but you'll need to pay. This is a place that I'd love to hike all the time if I lived in the area. We didn't enter the cave church since you can get the idea from the front entrance and you have to pay."

We started down at the Erzseb\u00e9t Bridge and got some lunch at the Hummus Bar. Then walked slowly up the hill taking in all of the beautiful autumn trees and stopping at each lookout. If you have good ankles and knees then you must do this!!! The views of Pest are insanely gorgeous at some points you almost get a 280 degree view. Once at the citadel we read some of the history had then had a mulled wine and sat and soaked in the cool sun."

The real draw is the journey of walking up here, not necessarily getting to the top, although the statue of the woman holding the leaf and the inexpensive souvenirs are lovely too. The citadel itself is nothing spectacular, but we had a good time walking up the many steps to get here and climbing down, and the whole time seeing a lot of Buda from different angles."

You can stop without embarrassment because you're not part of a group and you just want to admire the changing view.

Then you will reach the bottom of the hill and standing on Gellert Square. Hotel Gellert and the Gellert Baths are located at the square. Go up the sloping route to reach the citadel and liberty monument at the peak. Along the way there are chairs to sit and rest, photo takng corners. Beautiful view of Budapest along the way. The Liberty Monument is that of a lovely lady with a palm frond ,signifying freedom throughout the city. It was erected in 1947 as a tribute to the Soviet soldiers who died freeing Budapest in 1945. Many people go up and down the hill, especially n the evening. If you stay until the dark grows darker, the place will be lighted up and the view Budapest at night. Is awesome."

Spent an afternoon strolling, reading the plaques, admiring the view and learning. Beautiful views. Grounds need work due to funding difficulties but doesn't detract from the experience.It is also tourist trap. Expected to pay more but the mark-up on prices is ridiculous and seems designed to obtain as many tourist dollars as possible. For example, water at a supermarket was 0.65 florin. On site, it was just shy of 5 florin. Similar with everything else regardless of where it was purchased. Bring your own food if no prepared to pay the prices.Be aware of a con artist working on the grounds. The con is the shell game also known as three shells and a pea. He has two accomplishes who pretend they are tourists. The \"tourists\" play the game, sometimes losing, sometimes winning. Once he/they realize a person is he interested he deliberately shows the 'pea'; not at first but after several more wins/loses by his accomplices. The hook. While the mark is distracted with getting out money (100 Euros) he moves the pea."

But be aware that it is a major tourist attraction and will probably be packed with tourists. We also saw plenty of hustlers trying to get folks to bet money on shell games. AVOID these guys unless you want to go broke or get pick pocketed!But the statue is pretty hard to see from the base. The best photos of this one have been taken from drones that you can see some tourists flying around. You will get a wonderful view of the city from this area. You also have what looks like an old fort or bastion up there. It used to be open for tours, offering almost 360 degree view of the city, but it is now close to the public."

The monument itself is nice, but not that special. It's cool because it is such a landmark in Budapest and now you can see it up close. Despite the climb a must visit. Just take it step by step and maybe take some water with you."

We reached here from central Budapest by 46 or 47 bus then the 27 bus up the hill (walking up isn't recommended unless you are either a masochist or extremely fit). Other than the monument there really isn't much up there other than a smattering of tourist stalls. Given our time again we would probably use it in a different way and stick to Castle Hill for the views."

It's been mentioned before and it's worth noting that the climb to this hill consists of steep climbs and steps (albeit can be avoided if needed but they do save time). There are many benches along the route with some great views however some are broke or taken up by other hikers. We took this route on a humid day and didn't prepare for the climb as we didn't bring any water. There are a couple of stalls once you reach the top that offer souvenirs, water, beer or a good bite to eat. Prices for a bottle of water and a can of beer came to about 1400huf.Once you're at the top it's a great view of both Buda and Pest with plenty of photograph opportunities. It's definitely worth the tough climb so do preserver!"

There's also food stalls, one of which sells flavoured slushies (which I lapped up immediately to cool down).Overall a worthy experience, but I don't recommend to older people who have trouble with moderate to hard physical activity.

Also, there are no boards with explenations of what is there and which show directions.

Be warned however, the ascent is long, steep and tough so be sure to be prepared for a hard slog. Upon reaching the summit however, you quickly forget the walk as you marvel at the views. Some great opportunities for photographs of both Pest and Buda. There is a large monument to heroes of Hungarian freedom at the top of the hill as well as a large citadel fort, both of which have much history attached to them. You can also descend from the hill on the Southern side which brings you down to Gellert Spa for much-needed rest and relaxation after the walk.

There was a little craft market and stalls selling snacks and drinks which we did not use. There were also public lavatories up there.Under the actual statue there were quite a lot of people but a short easy walk down steps led to other viewpoints that were empty.It was very hot when we went there and we drank almost all our water, but we could have bought some more from the snack stalls. Some people were walking up which seemed madness to me since it was mid-day, the hill is very steep and it was 36C. They mostly looked shattered. It seems you can catch an ordinary bus up and end up where the coaches drop people off; I would certainly say that seems better."

For someone unaware of America\u2019s history\u2014and France\u2019s gift\u2014it means little, just a tall statue. I acknowledge my ignorance of Hungary\u2019s history and culture, though Budapest has now become my favorite European city.Atop Gell\u00e9rt Hill, indeed, the prominent 14-meter (46 feet) tall statue on a 26-meter (85 feet) pedestal erected in 1947 is called Liberty Statue, named for the (translation) \u201cMemory of the liberating Soviet heroes in 1945 by the grateful Hungarian people.\u201d Hungarians could not have known that though Soviet occupation did end the Nazi reign of terror, but a decade later led to a failed revolution. Gell\u00e9rt Hill stands hundreds of feet above Danube River making this statue appear as tall as her New York sister. The sculptor had intended the statue to hold a child, but the controlling Soviets insisted that be changed to a palm frond (which I originally thought was a feather).Gell\u00e9rt Hill and Liberty Statue are identified as one attraction\u2014adjacent to Citadel\u2014from which views of Budapest and the river are phenomenal. I recommend visiting here shortly before sunset, to experience growing shadows and exquisite colors of the landscape and many statues surrounding the area. There are places to enjoy a late picnic lunch, and I suggest a good Hungarian wine with exquisite local cheeses. There is no cost for visiting the half dozen attractions lining this hill, all of which are accessible for about a 75-cent bus ride."

In a city filled with male statues she was for us a strong and endearing statue reflecting hope and new beginnings. The Citadel and the view over the lawns and across the city are breathtaking...even on a cloudy day. The Danube is clearly visible flowing in both directions as it divides the city....Buda and Pest!

It is slightly confusing locating the entrance to the walk, as the slope begins down at the foot of the Liberty Bridge; whereas the Gellert Hill is the next hill over. The entrance is not signposted, though hopefully most should be able to figure it out for themselves when they see the crowds gathering at the waterfall migrating up and down the hill towards the smaller statue on your walk up.The walk up the hill is exhausting; particularly on a hot sunny day as it was when I attempted it. Once one reaches so far as the halfway point, however, they will be rewarded with magnificent views of Budapest - which is nothing to say for the views one witnesses at the summit. Unfortunately, once at the top after the pleasant walk, one will find... Not much. Huge crowds of tourists, an ice cream van selling drinks for more expensive than they are even in the UK, and the statue complex. The statues are nice to behold, even with the hilarious symbolism of a Russian worker punching a German eagle in the face. However, there is absolutely no indication of the statue's purpose, what it's there for, and its history. There is the odd sign in Hungarian, but given the huge crowds of American and West European tourists, I imagine they are typically unhelpful. As a result, I would like to rate the walk higher; but the negligence of the statue as a historical site means I can only rate three stars despite the lovely views and pleasant forest atmosphere of the rural hill. Disappointing."

One of the primary attractions in Budapest, Gellert Hill In Buda is one of the highest points of the city which is an excruciating yet rewarding climb to the top mounted monuments crowning the city hill. Personally, walking up the snow covered hill was a hilarious experience, as we slowly (but not quite steadily) made our way up battling the slippery terrain and back breaking climb. While cruising along the river one gets to see several night spots, the most brilliant of all being Dream island- a junction of 6 to 7 dynamic clubs. There are several types of clubs catering to different types of people and from different age groups, but the best club in the area was Studio which is also the largest club in Europe. While at glamourous spots like these one gets to witness a generation which has successfully moved on from the horrors of war, along yet other party streets of Budapest one comes across several multi-cultural joints, pubs and ghettos which show the melting hot pot of cultures that Hungary actually is! As compared to Buda, Pest is livelier and more dynamic, but the real treasure is what lies in the middle of the two cities. The river cruise is a must do and one of the best things that Budapest has to offer. The river cruise gave us an opportunity to enjoy the city views by night, and the most spectacular highlight was the chain bridge, one of the 6 bridges built over the Danube but most definitely the most beautiful of them all. The amazing thing about Budapest is that it genuinely has a lot to offer in terms of places to see and experience. The Gellert hill Cave is one such example, deep seated under the geller hill, this cave church holds way too many secrets and stories than can be touched on the surface. The hidden church tells the tales over time of peace and prayers in a time of war, historical milestones of Budapest and and the dark history of Gellert Hill itself, which was named thus after Saint Gellert who was thrown down from the top of the hill hundreds of years ago."

One read \"To the memory of all those who sacrificed their lives for the independence, freedom and prosperity of Hungary.

It was sprinkling on and off so not everyone on our tour chose to make the walk from the parking lot to the top of the hill. It was a good hike on an often uneven road/sidewalk. Not extremely difficult but good exercise. Beautiful views of the Danube River and Budapest. The statue itself has been rededicated more than once as political control of Hungary has switched. None of the shopping stalls were open when we were there. Either the rain or the fact it was a Sunday morning kept them closed."

The Liberty monument, from 1947, originally paid homage to the Soviet soldiers who liberated the city from the Nazis. She/Liberty rises majestically over the Danube, holding a palm leaf, I believe. Two other figures are below her but don't remember who they are."

Originally created in the memory of governor Horthy's son, killed by the Nazis, it was expropriated by the communists to serve as a statue of freedom. A Soviet soldier's statue stood at the foot of the lady. Removed during the popular uprising in 1956, it was put in place for another three decades until the late 1980s. The hill wasd called after a Roman catholic bishop of Italian origin who tried to persuade the pagan Hungarians about the advantages of Christendom. Unconvinced, the barbarians rolled down the bishop in a barrel (packed with nails) from the hill. The Austrians, who stayed in Hungary for a couple of centuries, built a rather ugly fortress called Citadella on the hill. Here you may find a restaurant, and on Aug 20, every year you may enjoy fireworks from the Gellert Hill, but stay on the Pest side in this case."

The view is well worth the climb (140mtrs high) which is perfectly fine for those who are used to a regular jaunt, but even if only used to 2-3klm walks, still go and ensure you take your time and plenty advantage of the many opportunities to sit on the way up. We had a 9 yr old and as usal, no problem for him. Went in April, however, would be much hotter in Summer so take account of that and ensure you take liquids (and something sweet for youngsters) as nothing until you reach the top (there is no cafe up there either).Stunning on way up and beautiful at the top - suggest leaving until towards the end of your stay so you can get a perspective of all the places you visited .... excellent hike for clearing the conscience for the hearty evening meal and drink(s) !"

This is a good sight saved for an evening after dinner, when you can enjoy the amazing view without feeling you're \"taking time away\" from other sights/activities you might be seeing or doing otherwise. (There are also lots of beautiful views of the city from the castle hill, with much more to do besides, whereas at the Citadel, it's mostly the view.)The monument was originally built to commemorate the liberation of the city by the Soviets, and there used to be statues of Red Army soldiers at the base. After 1989, the Hungarians were happy to get rid of Soviet remnants, but no one was ready to give up the statue here. The soldiers were removed and the inscription was changed, so now the statue stands more generally as a monument to liberty. Fun fact: It's said that children, when asked what the \"lady on the hill\" is holding in her arms (it's a palm leaf), often respond that she is holding a \"kifli\" -- a traditional Hungarian crescent-shaped roll that the little ones are very familiar with. :)It's possible to walk up to the citadel from the Buda side of the Szabadsag hid (Liberty Bridge) -- in fact, there are many paths to it -- but those who are older or out of shape (guilty on both counts!) may find it a serious challenge. If you're young and/or fit, go for it! Others may find it easier to get there by public transport (doable, but not so obvious to figure out) or by taxi (easiest, and probably most appealing if you decide to do this for a nighttime view after a good Hungarian dinner!"

The main reason of it is that it captures most of the iconic sights of Budapest like Buda Castle, Chain Bridge, Liberty Bridge and even partially Parliament and Basilica. You will see only half of these sights if you are standing on the Buda Hill. Also, this place is usually quite peaceful in contrast to Buda Hill.When you are on the Gellert Hill, there are also other things to do besides having a good time observing the city. For instance, you might visit Citadel and its military museum.The only negative part of this place is that it is quite challenging to reach its top. If you will try to walk to it from the bank of Danube, you might get exhausted. However, the walking way is much prettier than the one that tourist buses and taxis use, so little tiredness will be compensated by benches with the most romantic view to the city. We (a couple) recommend you to put Gellert Hill in the priority list of things to do when you are in Budapest."

It's easy to find and is easily accessible by public transportation or on foot.The Buda side of Budapest is filled with hills to see great panoramic views of Budapest, and Gellert Hill is a prime example of this. You can take a tour bus up to the top, or you can walk up the hill several different ways. I strongly recommend walking if you can because the nature aspect of the hill is quite beautiful, and there are many little places to stop and get views of the city you aren't going to get otherwise.When you get to the top, you can check out the incredible statue and see the huge Citadel building. You can also take in incredible views of Budapest, the Danube and Hungary that you aren't going to get many other places in the city.Take special care to pay attention to the way you go back down the hill. We went down a different way than we came up and ended up wondering through a neighborhood where the Saudi embassy was, but then got kind of lost and walked through a park with some questionable people in it. We were glad it wasn't dark, but just pay close attention to this as you make your way back down from the incredible top."

From the statue you can walk around the side of it past the outer edges of the Citadel, and down the opposite side of the hill to the Saint Gellert monument, all the way to the bottom to catch a tram or bus to the Buda Castle area."

I started by walking across the green Liberty Bridge in Pest and then walked up to this lovely hill. It has many lookup points that offer the visitors a panoramic view of the flat plains of Pest. Up there, the River Danube look so blue and gentle connected by many bridges linking Buda and Pest. When i was there, there are frosts leftover by the previous day 30 minutes light snow shower. It was very windy and cold up there but view made me forget about the chill. After reaching the summit, i can see some statutes and men betting on games. Then i walked downhill towards the White Elizabeth Bridge that brought me to Pest. I went to Gellert Hill twice because i stayed 8 nights in Budapest. So much idle time to kill!"

Only damper of the day was that there were a group of men doing the 'hide an object under one of three cups routine' and then strongly urging people to bet. They seemed to be targeting Asian people and showing them d denominations of notes they should bet with. A nice British lad called out that these were nice people they were fleecing who worked hard for their money. This was met with aggression and stone throwing. Kind of spoilt the mood.However, although there was nothing open here being cold January, the Citadella was impressive from the outside with a brilliant history of the building.

There was nothing open at the top btw, we hoped to stop for a snack or lunch but the cafe/restaurant is being refurbed so pop down to Gellert for a great and bargain priced lunch in the bistro instead."

Soviet troops put down the Hungarian revolution by occupying the citadel and firing from that height on the Hungarian rebels.Today its a tourist attraction in Hungary and a broadcasting point for many radio stations..The descent was smooth as there was a bus service from another end of the Citadel's Gellert hill and hence returned by motorized transport back to sea level in Buda."

There are many different paths and stair ways leading up from the river side to the monument. A long the way there are many resting places and small outcrops in the hill for watching the view. Be sure to walk around to the back side of the monument for additional views in the opposite direction from the river."

Budapest is blessed with a number of great places to see the city, including Fisherman's Bastion, the panorama of St. Stephen's Basilica or from the Danube on a night river cruise. But my favourite came at the top of Gellert Hill.Started the climb from the South side, after visiting the Cave Church. Basically would just pick whichever fork struck me as the most interesting, as a result I got different types of terrain from stairs to crumbling stairs to paths of various types. In general, it is a good climb, though nothing along the route I took was overly steep. You just know you are climbing. And it is worth it when you reach the top.Maybe wish it was more interesting up top, particularly with the Citadella, but looking outwards its great. If you forgot or run out of water, you can buy some of the most expensive non-restaurant water you'll find in Budapest. So be more organized than me.Going down, I seemed to find steeper paths, but again manageable. Enough that at the bottom, near Elisabeth Bridge, I enjoyed the cool down offered by standing next to the waterfall."

It has a tragic history, as the Citadel was built by the Russians after WWII, and they then used that hill (being the highest in Budapest) to bombard the city with tanks and field guns to suppress the Hungarian uprising in 1956. A significant part of the Pest side was destroyed during this time. The Freedom Statue was erected after Hungary was no longer a Russian satellite. It offers excellent views as well as several others on the Buda side of the Danube."

From there, take the short walk to the Citadella. Huge, impressive, strong fort. The views are stunning from there, a short walk further is the Freedom statue, the large statue of the lady holding the palm leaf.. Watch out for conmen there, using cards, dice or other bits and pieces to con tourists out of Euros or any other currency. From there, take a walk down the Gellert Hill. Near the hotel, you will find the Metro nr 4."

Also the view from the top, i.e. from below the statue is beautiful. And once you're up there, please, take a minute or two to admire it, don't just look through the lens of your camera."

You might enjoy the monument a bit more if you read a little about it ahead of time. Whether you do or don't read about it, this is a stunning moment, especially at night."

Me and my partner climbed up here one evening last week, it was an extremely tough climb (clearly my fitness levels aren't as good as I thought!) but worth it when we reached the top, fantastic views - photos don't do it justice. It was dark when we climbed up and there was barely any lights so it was quite spooky and difficult to see, I wouldn't have wanted to be on my own. We walked back down via the main road which took a little longer."

While some might like to hike up the hill or take public transport, we took electric bikes up (booked through \"I like EBike\" in Budapest) and it was almost effortless to cycle up all the way. Buses have to stop a distance away and visitors have to walk the rest, they allowed bicycles to travel all the way to the top. That's a real advantage because it can be tiring otherwise. The breeze was equally enjoyable."

A lovely lady with a palm over her head. Originaly erected in 1947 in tribute to the Soviet troops liberating Hungary from facism. Today the dedication is a bit changed. You can see that the text has been changed. In fact the statue was originally made for the hungarian facist ruler Horty to comemorate his pilot son, who was shot down over Soviet during the war, but it was not erected before 1947."

Walked around the edge of the citadel to the statues at the top. The views of the city are great up there and the price is right (free!). There is interesting information posted on the outside of the Citadel explaining some of it's history.On you way up, you constantly have to decide whether to go left or right, we just kept picking a way and eventually got there, I don't think any of the ways really get you off track. Definitely worth the walk up though (or take a bus if needed). Doesn't burn up much time if you are in a hurry, or you can take more time if you desire."

You got lovely views from here during dusk & stunning ones later at night.There is also a rather non descript & ugly statue of a child but the statue of Liberty with a woman figure holding an olive branch,the symbol of peace; has a more symbolic value with the victory of the child over the dragon symbolising the victory over facsism.It commemorates those who laid down their lives for independence,freedom & prosperity of Hungary."

You can see most of the best bridges, the Castle and the river. My problem with the Statue is that it is a Soviet \"Liberation\" monument and I believe in truth. Variations of these statues were located in every major city in the Soviet Union and captured lands, loosely based on the Mother Russia model. It was not a Liberation, it was an occupation with a brutal Communist regime. The monument should be removed and put in the Statue Graveyard which is another tourist attraction (Statue Park). The Soviet War Memorial at Freedom Square can remain because it honors the lives of brave men who fought for what they believed, but this should go. The Soviets erected this after the defeat of Hungary in World War II. Sorry, the truth."

Then during the Turk period it was called G\u00fcrz Elyas bayiri because of a holy man whose shrine was at the top of the hill. A bishop, called St. Gerard, played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in Hungary. Legend goes that in 1046 this saintly person was killed by the pagans in the great pagan rebellion. The pagans locked St. Gerard into a barrel and rolled it down the hill down towards the Danube. The hill was named Gellert Hill in the 15th century. This hill has the Liberty Monument on top. This monument was designed by Zsigmond Kisfaludyi Str\u00f3bl. It is a symbol of liberation from the Nazi rule. It was built in 1947 and placed on the Gellert Hill. It shows a woman holding a palm branch in her upraised arms. The statue is 14 meters high and is affixed on a 26 m high base. There is an inscription on the base which says, \" To those who gave up their lives for Hungary\u2019s independence, freedom and prosperity.\""

Since it was originally designed to honor the brave soldiers of the Great Soviet Army, there were soldiers by the footstool of the statue, but after the fall of the socialist area, it was decided to remain a statue of liberty, because liberty is good - if we can separate it from the Soviets.Nevertheless it really is a great spectacle, which deserves to honor liberty - the universal liberty, which all of us need. But that is not why it is an obligatory visit if you are in Budapest.There is no other place in the city where you get such a splendid view! If you would like to take panorama pictures of Budapest, come here. If you are planning to take night photos, come here. Thinking about a time-lapse video? The best spot is here.

If doing the same be sure to refill your water bottle at the fountain outside the hotel as nowhere to do so en route. The walk up is very shaded by trees. The area walking up did smell a bit of wee and there was quite lot of litter around, which did spoil some of the views. However all of this was forgotten when we reached the top.

Many people take a bus up the hill, walk around the citadella and take a bus back to Pest, but that would be a shame. You'll miss out on two beatifull walks downhill.There are two ways to walk down Gell\u00e9rt hill and both are lovely. One is to take a path down from the citadella on the side of Elizabeth bridge and walk down that way. You'll come down beautiful steps at the end but more importantly, you'll walk trough a park that is the stuff of Hungarian legend.The other path I recommend is the one leading to the famous Gell\u00e9rt hotel. You'll pass by two playgrounds (great with kids although the big slides seem a little dangerous, if you have very small kids, walk further down to find the kiddie's playground almost at the end of the hill). This is where you'll find the Hungarian themselves out for a stroll and not many tourists. Go for a fancy tea in the Gell\u00e9rt (with Dobosz cake, of course) and you'll have spent a wonderful morning or afternoon. You can walk back to Pest and the Vaci ut by the 'freedom bridge'. Both paths can be done with a stroller (I did it all the time) but it is an obstacle course...so beware."

AS gruesome as that was the hill is today so lovely and fashionable that it houses the most expensive real estate in Budapest. The area is very nice and splendid for a walk and viewing the statues."

This way you can get your pics during the day light and also after the city lights have come on. Originally I was going to walk up but due to the 37 degree heat, I decided to get the bus instead. After coming out of the M\u00f3ricz Zsigmond k\u00f6rt\u00e9r metro station into a big square, it was quite difficult to find the number 27 bus which more or less takes you to the top of the hill. After finding the bus (which is at the side of a big Spar shop), the ride took roughly 10 minutes to get to the top, and then it's a further 10 minute walk up to the viewpoint and statue. There are also a couple of places to get food and drink at the top."

Although this mightn't be a must-see for a lot of people, and there mightn't be loads to do, the views over the city from up high are so amazing that I just had to give this a five star review. Not to mention that the place is so easy to get to- you can go by tour bus, regular bus or tram, and of course if you're in the city centre anyway, it's only a short walk over, if you use the likes of Chain Bridge! But the funicular is a huge attraction as well- it's just such a quick, fun way to get to the top of the hill, not to mention that it saves you a long walk on a hot day! And the views from the top of the hill are definitely worth getting five stars!!"

Otherwise the Liberty Monument is massive, but typical Soviet era overblown and the Citadel was closed.

One way is to climb up the hill: you can, for instance, take the subway (M4) to Szt. Gell\u00e9rt t\u00e9r station, come out right next to the Gell\u00e9rt Hotel and Baths Complex at the foot of Gell\u00e9rt Hill and start walking up the paths and steps right up to the Monument. The second way - which we chose and were really glad about it afterwards when we were walking down the hill and saw all the tired and sweaty people going up, it was a really hot day, about +34 degrees Celsius - is, firstly, to take the subway (M4) to M\u00f3ricz Zs. K\u00f6rt\u00e9r station and, secondly, take the bus number 27 up the hill. The bus stop is easy to find from the subway station as it is very well market (exit C from the station if memory serves right) and the Citadella bus stop is the 7th stop from M\u00f3ricz Zs. K\u00f6rt\u00e9r. Gell\u00e9rt Hill and the Liberation Monument themselves were a journey worth to make. The view from the hill is spectacular, so you should take your time and sit there for a while. The central figure of the Monument is even bigger than expected, but since it can be seen from all over the city, it's really no surprise."

Not a real big hill with its 235m above see level, but it gives magnificent view to all direction. Its also a Unesco world heritage site - worth a visit. The location was a famous vinary of Buda before the XX.century - the interesting and unique thing about Citadella , it was built against the population in 1851-1854 by Julius Jacob von Haynau to controll the locals - therefore the cannons headed to the city of Pest, not to outside. Fortunatelly they never shot for real , only used for salutes. In 1867 it lost its military purpose, and the austrian soldiers left the fortress by 1899 . Funny thing about the fort - Locals wanted and began to demolish it - as it was a bad memento, but finally they couldnt finance it, so the fortification remained.The liberation monument was built in 1947 by russian order, and modified in 1992."

We had booked our train to Budapest not realizing it would stop at Ferencvaros train station. I asked on the Budapest forum what should we do. The experts there said to get off at the Kelenf\u00f6ld station and take the metro from there into town. When we did this, we looked at the metro map and saw a station stop at Gellert. We had heard of the Gellert baths and decided to check them out.The baths were nice - though the building looks like it could use a renovation or two. Since we did not have bathing suits we walked around and saw a statue at the top of the hill next to the baths. We decided to climb and check it out. The path is well paved, but beware, it is a steep climb in several sections. Take your time and you will be rewarded with one of the best views of the city. There are several stops along the way that will give good views, but plow on to the top and you will get a 360 degree view that includes all of Budapest and photo opportunities that would make you the talk of Facebook!"

Everything was in full bloom and birds were singing all around us. We peeked at the homes of people in the hills and it was really interesting to see. We approached the monument from the back, the walk turned out to be a lot easier than the last time. After reaching the top and duly admiring the momument, we began the walk down. Really beautiful views from the hill. There are two cafes just two minutes down, and we sat and had refreshments and then resumed our wonderful walk.Highly recommended. Don't forget to visit the church in the caves (just as you go up opposite the Baths). It's beautiful. We did not pay an entrance fee either times we visited, but there was an a ticket office which was closed."

I thought I had a good sense of direction and that this would be an easy landmark to find (after all it's just a question of getting to the top of a hill, isn't it?!) but curiously, my orientation deserted me. Perhaps because it was dusk approaching night. Anyway, getting up the hill is a bit of a challenge. I approached it from the side with the big hotel and made my way down past the statue of St Gellert. Even though I thought it was a bit late and maybe I shouldn't be on my own out there, it felt quite safe. There were lots of people at the summit. The path is actually marked with little painted numbers if I remember correctly but at the start, just above the hotel, I wasn't sure which way was \"up\" because it felt like the path was zig-zagging all over the place. The views are amazing at night with all the lights across the city. I'm glad I chose that time of day to visit because I imagine in the day it would have been much busier with people. I quite like night-time panoramas even though my camera is hopeless at taking night-time photos without a tripod. Naturally, the walk down was much easier."

We took the train and disembarked at Gellert Baths walking up the many stairs and winding pathways to reach the top. A great photo op for panoramic views of Budapest and the Danube, but nothing was opened at the top so we simply continued our long walk back down the hill. MANY stairs and some rough inclines so plan to take your time to avoid twisted ankles, stress on joints and general fatigue. There are a number of benches located throughout the pathways. We are in our 60's so would probably have spent our time better elsewhere."

The statues at the top are beautiful and really something to see u close- the freedom statue can be seen from all over Budapest, only when you stand next to it do you realise its enormity! we walked back down the other side of the hill, past the Gellert hotel, over the bridge and finished up in the market hall which is just over the other side of the Danube, a good walk with views to remember."

The Gellert Hotel is a piece of history and worth going into the foyer to see - and then around the side to the Spa and bath area (again pop inside to take in the architecture). I wish we had brought swimming costumes with us to bathe in the mineral baths. The day was sunny when we visited - but cold - but there were many visitors in the outside pools - and you could see they were warm and comfortable. We didn't have time to climb Gellert Hill (we will on our return) but the views will be magnificent. If you cross the bridge to the Pest side, as you walk down the main road there is a large impressive \"Gothic\" building on the right with a brightly tiled roof housing little market stalls inside. Again, well worth popping in and feeling as if you have gone back in time! It was bustling and busy......"

If you are in fair shape it will take about 15-20 to make the climb without stopping. However, there are lots of spots along the way to stop and take in some of the most spectacular and panoramic views of Pest the city offers. Start your climb next to the Gellert Hotel and stop at the Cave Church on the way up. It is worth the fee to get in the church and explore. Continue your climb, stopping along the way at several vistas to take in the view. Once atop take in the view, snap some photos of the Liberty Monument and get some water for your treck down the other side. I like to climb up early in the morning when few others are out. I always feel safe even though there seem to be a few folks hanging out that seem to waking from a long night of partying. There are a number of paths going up, it doesn't matter which trail you take just keep going up. Same story going down. I've climbed Gellert at least 10 times and never seem to take the same route."

The next day when we had reflected on the view we concluded that the sense of achievement outweighed the leaden legs. We were all very thirsty by the time we had reached the top and were glad to find we could buy water and there are also toilet facilities.The statues are very interesting and the view is spectacular but if you are short of time or maybe not that mobile then take a taxi, it's definitely worth it."

Well after crossing the bridge we started on a path upwards. And we climbed and we climbed. It took forever, but fortunately there are several places to stop and soak in the views. When we made it to the top and saw the Gellert Hill Statue I made sure to get my picture near it to prove I had made it to the top. Then we walked around a little and found that also on top of this hill is a Citadel. It was closed that day, but on the other side of that we noticed a road and some buses. So my suggestion, unless you're in great shape, is to find out how to catch a bus up there."

Although it appears daunting, if you don't stop but take it steady, it is only 15 minutes from the base to the top. The views of the Danube, the bridges, the Parliament House and all the other magnificent buildings are wonderful. It is probably best to approach it from the Green bridge. The number 2 tram on the Pest side takes you there, from the Chain bridge. If you walk instead of taking the tram, it is about 20 minutes apart."

Once we arrived at the top, there were people there, but it wasn't overly crowded or noisy, which is another perk of visiting at night.

The Liberty Monument is pretty spectacular, but to be honest I preferred it viewed from across the river. The Citadella was not open when we were there, being under repair or something. This attraction is nice, but there are lots of other attractions that are a better use of your time in Budapest. if you have time walk up the hill visiting the other statues and look-offs along the way."

The gellert hill statue also called the liberty statue was erected to commemorate the liberation of Hungary from the German/Nazi occupation by the Soviets during the 2nd world war. The statue was erected in 1947 and has a main statue on the central plinth flanked by 2 on either sides. Its located on the far side of the Citadella - which itself can be reached via bus 27 from the M\u00f3ricz Zsigmond k\u00f6rt\u00e9r metro station.The statue's inscriptions were since then modified from commemorating the Soviets to just being dedicated to all the people who sacrificed their lives for the betterment of Hungarian people.Some of the most amazing views of the city can be seen from atop the citadella just next to the status itself.The statue because of its position and erection atop the plinth can be seen from a distance from the city as well - especially when you take a cruise trip on the Danube.I would definitely recommend visiting the statue and the Citadella when you are in the city - for its position in the Hungarian history as well as for the views of the city."

We also found it interesting to walk around the Citadel, where there are lots of information boards about the city , hill, status, and all sorts of tidbits that we read with interest.

While the views certainly are great (it's a hill in the heart of a vibrant capital, after all), what you're going to find on the very summit isn't anything to write home about. Sure, it's one of the symbols of Budapest and, despite the negativity you may sense from the review, you should see it just to have your own opinion but for me, it wasn't quite the cathartic experience many seem to attach to it.If you don't enjoy hill climbing in general, don't fool yourself into thinking this would be any different just because it's in the city and is one of the main attractions so \"it should be easy to reach\". It's not and it's a painful walk with poor signage - so glad I took the bus uphill and only walked down. The bus going there (number 27) starts its route two tram stops after the stop beside Hotel Gellert so it may seem a bit of a trip on its own but it'll take you almost to the very top (the same altitude that the tour buses stop at, anyway)."

(Walk via the cave church, that's en route). The views are, in my opinion, at least as good as those from castle hill (the one with the furnicular), probably better...This is an essential trip, and worth a whole day to stroll up, be impressed with the views, and that amazing statue at the top (she's HUGE!). And then of course the stroll back down. There are icecreams, drinks and of course souvenirs at the top - a tip: everything up there is something like 50% cheaper if you pay in the local currency- you'll pay way, way more if all you have is Euros. This is a hugely worthwhile trip."

None of the guide books really helped explain how you get to the top of the hill so we took the tram to the bottom of the hill and walked up. Well, it's a loooooong walk. When you get to the top there are great views over the city, there's quite an impressive looking statue and unfortunately we couldn't work out how to get into the citadella, if you even can, I still don't know.And then you have to walk all the way back down again. Apparently there's a bus that goes to the top of the hill from somewhere and probably comes back down again from somewhere but of course, no guidance anywhere of how this might happen.If I have one complaint about Budapest, it's that they're just not well geared for tourists who might not know which bus/tram you need to get to go somewhere. Compare with somewhere like Prague which has it nailed.I probably sound grumpy, but I did see a lot of other things in Budapest that were so much better than this, and I really don't think it's worth the effort unless you fancy a bit of hill-walking or you work out how to get there some other way."

So, we hiked up the more direct path on the north-eastern end... it didn't take too before we were enjoying the lovely views and found motivation to hike the rest of the way up. At the top, there was much more than incredible views over the Danube and city. The Liberty statue, and two other statues were lovely, but there was also a collection of market stalls, a restaurant, a museum, and specialty shops, so we wandered around (and secretly thought those who took the sightseeing buses up were cheating a bit!). We returned down leisurely, enjoying the lovely gardens (and even playground areas) built along the southern end. It helped that it was a beautiful sunny day. Especially as a free attraction, it is well worth the effort - the views are unsurpassed, and the gardens are relaxing. There are also plenty of benches around to sit on if you don't fancy sitting on grass."

This is a nice place to spend a bit of time outside, in the fresh air, and taking in the sights of this beautiful city. On the southern side of Gellert Hill, you can visit the Cave Church before making a comfortable ascent up paved walkways towards the top of Gellert Hill. There are numerous stopping points with park benches and lovely views of the Danube River and the Buda side of the city. At the top of the hill, you can visit the Citadel and see the large statue know as Liberty Statue, which commemorates all Hungarians who have lost their lives in the pursuit of national independence and prosperity for the nation. On the northern side of the hill, not far from Elisabeth Bridge, you can see the Gellert Monument, a large bronze statue dedicated to former Bishop Gellert, for whom the hill is named. It is believed that Bishop Gellert was killed at this spot in the 11th century. Overall, we very much enjoyed the light hike conditions and comfortability of climbing Gellert Hill. We also found the views of the river and city to be very nice from this throughout our climb. In the end, we\u2019d suggest targeting Castle Hill first because of the higher number of important attractions found there. However, if you are wanting a more rural hill top and climb, a climb up Gellert Hill is a nice activity and way to spend a few hours in Budapest."

Going down, I followed one of many paths through the park on the SW side of Gellert Hill and took a different bridge back to the Pest side.

You really don`t have to be an athlete to get to the top, it`s not that high. The views of Budapest are thoroughly enjoyable, and yo get the added benefit of a bit of exercise. If you are really lazy there are also some buses going to the top. At the top there are some cool communist-inspired statues, and of course \"the citadel\". If you have time,money and a desire for knowledge you should visit the citadel and learn about the past of Budapest.Tip; A good time to be on the top of the hill is around sunset. The colors can be spectacular."

So you've walked over the Danube and had a look inside the Gellert Hotel at the stained glass panel on the staircase; then wandered through the great hall of the baths, and perhaps taken a dip. Now just over the road and on the side of Gellert Hill is something...but what is it. Go up and take a look. This is no ordinary church, but one built into the back of a cave by the Pauline order of monks. Pay your 500huf (400 if your a student or over 62), pick up your guided talk and let the atmosphere and history flow over you. This place is quite emotive. It is a gem but not publicised by the tourism board. Much more moving than the posh gilt and gold churches around Buda and Pest. Don't miss it - we may have been church and castled out by our travels but this place will stick in our memories.There is wheelchair access to the main cave and church but one small area that cannot be accessed - however the commentary covers that bit very well."

This is the place to go if you want the best views of both the Buda and Pest side. You don't need to walk up to the statue to see it. I'm sure it's a better view from the tippy top, but we only had a day in Budapest. It would have taken too much time out of our day trip to do it. The view at the citadel level was all that we needed to get an idea of where everything is situated along the Danube. You can see Buda Castle, Fisherman's Bastion, Matthias Church, Parliament, and the bridges from this level. Amazing views!This is also a great place to get souvenirs. They have many kiosks as well as novelty shops near the entrance to the citadel. We found some unique gifts at one of these shops. There are many places to sit and relax while feeling the cool breeze. I kind of wish we would have ended our tour here as well. It would have been nice to view the river as the sun is setting.

It was a slightly challenging hike, however, this may have been the result of just having lunch and having hiked extensively in the morning as well. The statute at the top was good, so was the citadel but not overly amazing. There was also a bit of a garden on one side of the hill. All in all it was good to go up but I would not put it on a list of must sees for Budapest."

This takes you up the hill most of the way - get off when you get to a big restaurant on your right (after 7 stops). Then follow the signs up to the Citadella - about 5-10 mins' walk.There a several viewpoints and you can get into the Citadella for free after 7pm. Watch out for marauding tour grous who seem to come up at all hours of the day! There's a decent pizza/pasta/Hungarian restauruant (The Lounge) as well as the main 'posh' restaurant, where you can eat looking out over the city."

The Buda side of the river is dominated by the palace and the Gellert Hill- both are must do\u2019s in Budapest but more for the walk and view than to see the statues (which are better seen from a distance). Stairs and paved paths go up from the river to the top of Gellert Hill. While most tourists take a bus to the top, the best way to experience Gellert Hill is to walk it. It\u2019s a brisk, very pleasant 20-30 minute walk to the top of the hill through thick forest and singing birds- a welcome break from the city. The views from the top are spectacular- a panorama of the Buda hills, the full length of the river and bridges, and across to Pest and the Parliament building. We ended up doing once during the day and then once after dinner. The evening walk was particularly special- the path is dimly lit in parts but safe, with many walkers in the evening going up and down the hill. At the top, the views of the city at sunset and then with everything lit up was memorable. The scene at the top had both tourists and locals- the locals had brought up drinks and pizza in many cases and enjoyed the view and peace from the city with friends- seemed like a perfect way to spend a warm spring evening."

It was good fun climbing Gellert Hill to the top, though the hike was more difficult than our guidebook made out to be (it was said that the walk's \"bark was worse than its bite\", though as a group in our twenties we still found the climb quite tiring). About halfway up you find the Gellert Statue, which is one of the reasons the attraction doesn't get an excellent rating - the monument has seen better days, with lots of graffiti on it and not very well-kept in general. The view from this point is pretty good, but it is worth continuing on to the top where you reach the Liberty monument (the woman holding the olive branch). The views from this point are truly excellent, and you can have some great shots standing on the mounds around the monument, with the entire of Pest as your backdrop. There's also a nice route back down so you can visit the Gellert cave church and hotel+baths, though be prepared to get a bit lost - there are many possible paths to get up/down the hill but no signposts at all. Overall, I think Gellert Hill is a fantastic place to visit but needs to be better looked after by the authorities (cleaning up the graffiti on the main landmarks, putting up some simple signposts)."

That being said, there are not as many tourists in this place as there are in other places of Budapest. In fact, as far as attractions go, it's the attraction with least amount of tourists that I have been to, and I have lived in Budapest for several months. I did not take a bus up there; rather, I walked it, and if you're in fairly good physical condition, I suggest you do this as well. There are other people on the trails up the hill, but by far, it's the emptiest \"green space\" I've ever seen in Budapest--I imagine because, well, it's quite a climb. Nevertheless, for me it was a welcome reprieve from the normal rushing crowds of the city. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list of things to see in Budapest, but if you're here for a while or hate crowds, it's worth a visit."

We visited on a cloudy windy day and a brisk sunny morning and the difference was clear. We visited as part of a Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (there are many of these in Budapest) on our first day in Budapest which was cold, windy and cloudy. We could tell that the view was great and planned to come back on a nicer day. The next morning was beautiful and we hiked up the hill from our hotel in Pest. It was a nice vigorous hike (250 m of elevation gain) with good views on the way up and the exceptional one from the top. Could see the surrounding hills to the west and the plains to the east. It is true that there was quite a bit of graffiti on walls and rocks on the trails up and at the top. There was a bit of trash left by uncaring people as well. If one can look beyond that, I think that the view is definitely worth the trip provided you have adequate weather.The main statue is large and visible from far but not too visible from up close. However, we did have fun taking photos with other statues at the top."

On the way up we stopped at the St. Gell\u00e9rt Monument,Tab\u00e1n Parish Church and Deer House as well as the Garden of Philosophy. A very neat sculpture composed of eight figures. The five central figures Abraham, Echnaton, Jesus, Buddha and Lao Tse encircled around a central pond with 3 outlying figures being Mahatma Gandhi, Daruma Taishi and Saint Francis all representing people from different times and cultures who influenced spiritual enlightenment. Definitely worth a look if you are up there. For those who read this with small children we also stumbled across a popular play area equipped with children's slides of different length and difficulty. It's not easily visible from the main path, we found it by the sound of laughter but I think it is marked by wooden signs pointing to the 'csuszd\u00e1k'. (I hope I got that right if not please forgive)We finally reached the top and really enjoyed the views very picturesque but as we found the best was yet to come. We stayed as the sun began to set and I must say as twilight fell and city lights began to spring to life it provided a one of a kind view which in my opinion is one not to be missed especially if you get the chance to enjoy it with that special someone. Additionally it was not just a wonderful experience but I believe gives a first time visitor a great introduction and first impression of the city, it will also make future orientation much easier, because it's like laying out a map of Budapest in front of you. You can see the structure of the city and the difference between the hilly Buda side and the flat Pest side, with the picturesque Danube dividing the two.Add this to your must do list while in Budapest"

We were also surprised to see lots of stalls selling souveniers and hundreds of people who had come up by bus from the other side. We much prefered the route we took up and down. We'd suggest this if you can hack the walking!"

Besides this, there is nothing else to do here, there is a museum (we didn't go in) but apart from that small souvenir shops. BEWARE of a group of men that are total scammers! We witness them in action and it is sad that they would take advantage of tourist. They work in groups and this is how they do it. One man is the one doing the action- hiding one object and moving three boxes very quickly so you can guess where the item is hidden. As you are diligently observing his quick moves there are two or three men around pretending to be tourist and saying where they think the item is hidden. The men stand close to the onlooking tourist and that's when they pick pocket. There are also two men up the hill who serve as the \"look-out\" in case the police comes. We witness an Asian man asking the men if they took something from his wife. The scammers pretended they didn't know what he was talking about and they pointed at a different direction of where the \"scammer\" was, after the Asian man left distressed they all ran away. They came back about 7minutes later to do the scam all over again since a new crowd of tourists comes every 10 minutes or so. Keep your belongings always at your side and don't fall for these scammers. Just take your pictures and move on."

The view from the top is great, though it was rather crowded when we were there. Still, there is a great feeling of accomplishment being right next to the statue high up on the hill that you can see from many vantage points throughout Buda and Pest.When we got to the top we found a stall selling cold water which we immediately partook of. Good thing we did, as it closed right afterwards (at mid-day) though all the other vendors around the Citadel were still open. We walked around and saw various statues and old cannons.If we had gone by bus (public or Hop On/Hop Off), I probably would have given this attraction a higher rating.

We chose the former but I'm sure either route would be good.You get some great views on the way up & from the top out over Pest and the park on the Gellert hotel side has some sculpture to take a look at as well as a couple of kids play areas.Once at the bottom on the Gellert side you are just opposite the baths & 2 minutes from the church (back up the hill) If the walk has made you hungry then wander over the bridge & grab some food from one of the upstairs stalls at the Market.

There were some souvenir shops on Gellert Hill selling secret boxes, hand puppets. There were also some activities that can be purchased for a fee like riding a small tank, holding artillery, using archery.We also went here for our night tour. It was a beautiful sight at night!"

Do take the hop on hop off tour if your not up for the thirty min climb. when your up there and your not carted off to the nearest oxygen tank supply area !!!! you ll marvel at the beautiful paneramis views of the whole of Budapest. Wait till sunset for the best snaps of Budapest with all its lights on. Hve a meal at the castle resturant its fab and the oven baked pizza was only 7.50 for a huge homemade 12\". Please allow yourself a good few hours up here its so beautiful. Be careful on your way down at night time as if you ve waited for sunset snaps it will dark quickly on your decent. Enjoy"

We got off the No 27 at B\u00fasul\u00f3 Juh\u00e1sz (Citadella) which I think is 7 stops from when you get on (the bus stop at the terminus gives English instructions) and then follow up the hill. I found this website after we came back to the UK (sadly!) http://www.bkv.hu/en/day_services_map/day_services_mapThe views are spectacular and there is no charge to see them either! We particularly wanted to see Liberty and have popped some photos of what we saw the views were Amazing.We chose to walk down back to the city which took us 25 mins stroll and brings you to the back of the Gell\u00e9rt Hotel.There are toilets there too either as one of the automated 'pods' or inside the entrance to the Citadella both charge 100 HUF (about 30p).You have run the gauntlet of stalls on the way up but that is the only con I can think of."

You can climb up to the hill from the Elizabeth Bridge or from the Liberty Bridge (behind Hotel Gellert) but also travel by bus from Moricz Zsigmond K\u00f6rt\u00e9r almost to the top. I like the view from the hill to the city especially by night - I live in this city and I was 17 years old when I first climb up at night. Since then I like to go when it's dark. The city is more beautiful that time :)"

The statues at the top were interesting to check out. There are several stands to buy souvenirs like jewelry, paintings, etc. It is definitely worth the walk up."

Nice to relax at the top and rest and even read for a wee while. Worth the climb and I felt justified having my dinner that evening!"

You are climbing a couple hundred meters plus, so it's a brisk walk but completely doable; how easy you find the walk, and how tired you feel at the end will likley depend completely on your level of fitness. Once at the top, you can wander the Citadel for a bit, grab a drink from one of the vendors at the top, and pat yourself on the back for a job well done."

We walked up from the Elizabeth Bridge and found it fairly easy to follow the path all the way up to the top of Gellert Hill and the citadel. Plenty of good views from the top, and surprisingly, given the location and the numbers of tourists, the prices offered by the path-side souvenir sellers by the citadel were the cheapest we found in Budapest."

There are some good view point stop off's along the way.I visited Gellert Hill with my female friend (we're both mid twenties) around lunch time on a saturday. We felt perfectly safe as other people were wandering up the hill also and we were in broad daylight, however we were flashed at by 2 men on 2 seperate occasions! Bad luck! That did leave us feeling vulnerable as we didn't know the area well enough to get out of there. It was definitely planned as one of the men spoke to us in Hungarian minutes before, and had obviously watched to see where we were going.This is most probably an isolated event, and im certain it wouldn't happen if you are travelling with a male! But its just a warning to females travelling alone or in small groups!"

It's a great way to see the city. Take one of the public transport buses up closer to the top so you don't have to climb up the whole thing (#27 I believe). The monument and hill were named after Bishop Gellert who was apparently rolled down the hill in a barrel nailed with spikes on the inside. There is a restaurant at the top near the Citadell and also little booths for buying trinkets or drinks and ice cream bars. You must try a Magnum bar if you are from the US. At the top you'll enjoy the lovely views and get an overview of the city. Then when you are done you can walk down the backside and end up near the Gellart Hotel. If you have kids traveling with you, note there is a big park area with lots of fun slides along this decent, but going up the hill with kids would be a huge feat. We passed one guy pushing a stroller up the hill and he was just about to give up. When you get to the bottom, in front of the Gellert hotel there is a neat spring fed fountain where you can fill your water bottle or just stop for a quick drink(see picture). Enjoy!"
