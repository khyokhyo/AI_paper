I thoroughly enjoyed this neighbourhood - felt more authentic - there aren't hustles of souvenir shops and crowds or people trying to sell you something. We had a stroll through it coming from Campo de Fiori and making our way to the piazza. There were many lunch options here too. Make sure you make one of your meals here so you can enjoy wandering around here."

I mean so busy and great food and shopping as well. All small shops. Such a bloody charming area. And just one more thing. People who love area like trastevere would love positano over sorrento and amalfi. I mentioning this out of context. Stay in positano. It's beautiful. Have a happy journey."

It is popular with locals, and when we visited on a Saturday lunchtime it was busy but with good atmosphere. We found it hard in Rome to find a restaurant that served light snacks at lunchtime as most are geared towards full meals or pizzas, but there were several nice options in Trastevere. We ate in Samovar, just off the square with the Cathedral, and they had lovely toasted bread buns made with pizza dough and various fillings. I had the roast vegatables with hoummus fillings and they were really nice. I also found a lovely bakery in the narrow streets, and bought some treats to take back to the hotel for afternoon tea breaks."

The taxi driver stopped across the bridge and we had to cross that which leads to an island and then to the bridge which takes you to the tram lines. As you enter it doesn't look like anything is there however if you keep going you will find dozens of cozy, local and friendly bars/restaurants. The friendliest place we went in Rome. Unfortunately it was our last night that we discovered this place on recommendation from the receptionist. I would advise asking where the best restaurants are or you won't get to enjoy the food to its full potential. We ate at Gino 51, the food and service was great and exactly what you want as a guest in someone's country. We then went for a few glasses of wine in nearby bars until we ran out of cash then got a taxi home. I highly recommend this place to couples looking for a nice intimate meal and drinks in an authentic area. I'm told this is the best place to get really Italian food and that there are only a few good restaurants dotted around the city elsewhere. Take a taxi or bus there and stroll around and enjoy the atmosphere, food and drink. You won't be disappointed."

Even though we went at the end of September it was very humid. The tours we took were amazing. The guides always made sure that when we stopped that the group was in the shade. We did a tour of the coliseum, Forum, Paltine Hill, that also included Caesar Augustus home. Was truly amazing and worth doing. We also tour the Borgessie and Vatican City. Both of those are worth buying the tickets ahead of time so you can skip the line. The tour promoters send people out to get you to buy there tickets and they are literally in your face constantly. I recommend that you go online to the museums website directly and buy your tickets. This can be time consuming, but worth the effort and is much cheaper than going through one of the tour company."

This was a unique experience; we were included as instant \"friends\", introduced to other guests, offered glasses of prosecco, to try dishes we'd never heard of, and we enjoyed every minute.Lunch lasted around three hours, with coffee and grappa provided gratis by the restaurant, and the bill was unbelievably small; around \u20ac60 for the two of us.Northern Europeans don't expect this type of spontaneous generosity and friendliness, but we'll remember our visit to Trastevere for many years to come."

We first went into one of the wine bars and had a drink this wine bar had a buffet that came with certain wine and you could also purchase it for $5 with any other drink, I really wish we discovered this place sooner because the buffet looked great but we were saving up for our last night's dinner so we didn't get it. This area also had a lot of historic sites and wish we had more time to explore more of it."

I would first head for the road Vicolo del Cinque in Trastevere by crossing the Ponte Sisto bridge but you could also get here by crossing the Ponte Garibaldi. The area is full of restaurants, shops, bars, cafes and gelaterias - just wander round and explore. You'll be glad you did!"

That gradually changed and Trastevere became packed with tourists, looking for a true, italian neighbourhood - full of small alleys and colorful houses covered with ivy and flowers. From my understanding, many people these days try their luck in the neighbourhood of Monti, or even some other neighbourhoods, because of the numerous tourists in Trastevere, who're ruining the fundamental atmosphere. Nevertheless, I believe everyone should visit Trastevere."

The area doesn't have the monuments you can find everywhere in Rome, but you can visit the church Santa Maria di Transtevere and have a rest in one of the restaurants there. In my opinion you should go there in the evening when there are a lot of people and the place is full of life. We were there on a Saturday morning , around 11, and the place seemed empty and lifeless. But be aware that it isn't as impressive as the other part of the city."

The great benefit is the ease of finding great places to eat without paying the tourist surcharge and sometimes finding the mediocre dressed up to impress. Trastevere is full of tourists to be sure, but also has neighborhoods where grabbing panini and cappuccino elbow up to the bar at 1000 with a dozen locals catching up on morning news and talk is far more fun than being overcharged for the same being surrounded by tourists."

In Rome during the summer until October I think, they have sort of a city-rule about no drinking outside. But it seems this doesn't count for Trastevere, or restaurants in general. The drinks further into Trastevere are prices around 5-9 \u20ac. Well worth visiting for a night out in Rome"

Lots of cafes, free spirited people, drinks, delicious food, live music in the streets, beautiful lightings, amazing buildings.. Ideal. My favorite part of Rome for spending evenings. Here u can feel how eclectic the city can be, with (almost) all the major sightseeings on the other side of the river (excluding Vatican City of course), Trastevere still manages to surprise and please you with its uniqueness and sincerity."

Quaint, beautiful cobbled streets, lots of locals enjoying outdoors life, plenty of lovely restaurants and bars all lit up at night. Look out for street entertainment, open air cinema in the many Piazza. I believe there was a festival on the last two weeks of July so there was lots going on. Stalls and bars all along the River which was great to walk along in the evening.Take the number 115 bus up the hill for amazing views of Rome where you can also find a couple of bars and snack food. We went just before sunset so where able to enjoy the sunset and Rome lighting up. Continue on this bus down the other side of the hill, get off at the river to walk through to the Vatican Museums. The 115 is circular so you can jump back on it and you will soon be back where you started.The H bus will take you to and fro Roma Termini and Trastevere.Jump on the tram no. 8 just 6 stops to take you into the centre right beside Roman Forum and Colosseum. Although if you don't mind walking it's not far.We flew into Ciampino airport. Bought a bus ticket from the Terravison or SIT bus for around \u20ac5 to Roma Termini, then we bought a 72 hour travel pass from Roma Termini which was valid for tram, bus and metro. The H bus took us to Trastevere. There is no metro where we were in Trastevere but buses and trams where very easy and frequent. It was very hot so found hopping on transport saved our strength a little.Fill up your water bottle for free at the \"big noses\" on the streets which are water fountains which look like fire hydrants. All though there aren't really public toilets there was a toilet in every little bar and restaurant we went to although not always very clean.We loved Rome and Trastevere and would definitely come back."

My daughter and I felt very safe walking around Trastevere, even late at night. It's location is central, and we walked to Trevino fountain, Pantheon, Vatican, Campo market, Piazza Navona, Gianicolo Hill for the amazing view of the entire city. Dar Poeta has excellent pizza. Mama Frites has the best French fries... Located on Viccolo del Cinque and opened late.

There is such a rich character to this neighborhood and personality. You see cats hanging around in their territories, and you really feel like you are almost in some small town in the country side. It is not chaotic amongst all the cars like the other parts of Rome. A lot of the ares is pedestrian only so you can really enjoy a peaceful walk. I recommend walking around early mornings or evenings. Some areas do get a bit more congested with some bars overflowing out into the streets, but its a great area to sit in a cafe and have a drink and people watch."

Meander down the hill and take your time heading toward the Vatican. There is an abundance of coffee shops to peek into, and if you enjoy art - the mosaics at Basilica di Santa Maria are a must.

Both my parents were born and brought up here close to San Francesco a Ripa. Until the '90s I would have loved to settle in Trastevere and enjoy its lively atmosphere. Nowadays its popularity and night life have increased too much and turned it into an over-crowded place. Strolling along its vicoli has lost its former genuine charm as I feel more like painfully cueing than walking for pleasure.

Pretty buildings with ivy and flowers all around We wandered around for hours and loved it so much went back the next day! I would highly recommend going there! We started from Ponte Palatino and walked. I think the best area is between Ponte Girabaldi and Ponte Sisco. So nice!!! Enjoy a beautiful day there!"

It was a nice way to get away from the tourist and the loudness of the main attractions in Rome. We had dinner at La Prosciutto restaurant. The prosciutto with cantaloupe was the bomb(awesomeness); the other meats were just as tasty. We ordered a simple board for 3 people and it was so good we ordered more prosciutto with melon for 3.

For a taste of a Piazza used by the locals, make your way to Piazza San Cosimato. Fresh food market there daily till 1 pm.

Try the local foods, but be critical of the prices. Waiters will be quite persistant inviting you in. It's all your choice really. Since the area is quite crowded, be wary of pickpockets.

Trastevere is full of quaint stores and trattorias- something different around every corner. We also visited ornate Santa Cecelia, a beautiful couch nestled in the neighborhood. After exploring Trastevere for a few hours, we ended up eating at Cave Canem and I recommend it as well- very delicious and extremely affordable! After dinner we walked to the Piazza Santa Maria de Trastevere and sat at the fountain in the center of the piazza, the \"neighborhood couch\" as it was called by someone who suggested we go. We just sat and people watched and after a while, some performers began entertaining the crowd. I definitely recommend visiting this quaint neighborhood when visiting Rome~"

Lots of little hidden streets and cafes and the MOST beautiful church which we stumbled across, The church of Santa Ignezia. It had such a calm peaceful feel that it reduced me to tears. So pretty, its a must see even if you feel you've seen enough churches please visit this one.

The beauty and history surrounds you and the vibe from the people hanging around is young and chill and worth a visit."

During the day, this place is a little maze of cobbled streets that house tiny restaurants and shops. At night, the street performers roll out and sellers of various wares - whatever the weather. My favourite restaurant in Italy is in Trastevere, which I have reviewed separately (Sabatinis) but an outdoor seat here, opposite the church is a definite recommendation if you have some cash available. If Sabitinis is out of your price range, there is a huge selection of restaurants and bars here and a couple of sports bars too!When you think of italy, this is the place that matches your expectation."

I have been living in Trastevere for several months, and going to the other side (city center) of the river just isn't as much fun, despite there being so much to do over there as well. There is a different vibe in Trastevere. Sure, there are a lot of tourists, but there are plenty of locals as well. It's not at all like the areas of Piazza Navona or Piazza Spagna (Spanish Steps), which feel distinctly tourist-y these days. In Trastevere there are so many little restaurants where you can get a good meal, great wine, and just enjoy your afternoon or evening. There are also lots of little shops where you can buy cute things (if that's what you're looking for). The Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere comes alive at night with all kinds of various entertainment in the form of street performers/musicians. If you're staying in another part of the city, you need to at least devote a day to Trastevere, as it is a nice way to feel like you're in a semi-different place without having travelled far! I will ONLY stay in Trastevere when I return to Rome, as it truly feels like home!"

Wandering around were lucky to catch a procession along Via Di Santa Dorotea to Chiese Parr Santa Dorotea. An unexpected bonus to our walk around the area.

Simple, new, dbl room with windows overlooking the small plaza provided lots of entertainment - viewing of the crazy local traffic, daily smell of La Renella bakery, place to dry our laundry and watching the people come and go. Cabot University and Beige bar were active late at night but the noise was manageable even with our windows open (except Sat). We are in our 60's and had no issues with walking everywhere in Rome. Admittedly a daily siesta during the heat at midday helped. Local eateries are abundant, food fantastic and people friendly. A must stop is Casa Mia for the food, staff svc, hotel accomodations, Aperol spritz and LAa Renella for take out bread, sheets of different flavored pizza (more like flat bread) and pastries.This is the place to be in Roma."

I finally had the opportunity to spend several days there. It is true, that as far as Rome goes, this is a little bit of village atmosphere a stone's throw from the center of Rome. However, if you have the chance, go and discover other parts of Italy that are many times more charming. The hill towns of Umbria and Tuscany offer much more charm. For me, Rome is all about the big sights, the cultural aspects of Rome as a ruling power. Whether is it the Forum, the Coloseum, the Trevi fountain etc. etc. etc. These, and all the other great historic landmarks are why you go to Rome. I wouldn't waste a day on Trastevere when you can have an expresso in Piazza Navona or a granita de cafe in Piazza del Poppolo or hang out on the Spanish steps and people watch. There are so many great things in Rome to see and do. If you want Italian charm - head to Positano or Montepulciano, go to the Cinque Terra or the many wonderful places on the Adriatic Coast. Rome is Rome - drink it in. Find your charm elsewhere."

Still just a little off the beaten path this neighbourhood in Rome is a great place to spend an afternoon wandering around relaxing, eating and recharging with locals. Lots of restaurants serving classic Italian food, give yourself at least 3 - 4 hours to stroll around. Access this area by Tram 3 or 3B (tram ->bus combo) or tram 8 (easier)."

Got a few slices of pizza at La Bocacchia and enjoyed people watching at the piazza by St.Maria's church. Always some entertainers around, like street musicians and artists, or bubble makers for the kids. The St.Maria church is also well worth a visit. Beautiful golden tiles and a serene atmosphere. Sure, it is a tourist magnet (and we're usually more in to \"off the beaten track\" kind of places) bumped in to a lot of people of my own nationality. But is still a charming area that has a genuine feeling to it."

No real plan, and we found ourselves charmed by the quiet, tourist-free streets and interesting nooks and crannies we found as we walked around for a couple of hours... There were lots of restaurants and bars, but all we tried was a quick organic (bio) espresso and bottled water when we stopped in a little shop for a few minutes. The owner was very friendly and told us that what we were seeing was because it was early and that the tourists and busy-ness comes later in the day... and that the nightlife was very very busy. Not our scene, so we wandered a little further, ran into a band practicing (beautifully) a few blocks 'in' to the neighbourhood and then to Santa Maria Capella, and ancient church consecrated in 1090. Only \u20ac5 each to enter and we had the both the ancient church and it's in-progress excavation and relics to ourselves. Most everything there is in Italian, so bring a friend or a guidebook if you want to translate as you're viewing the relics.Finally, completely unexpected and very moving and sad, were the three cobblestones that had been replaced by bronze markers remembering three people in one home who had been taken to Auschwitz. As sad as that was, it was a beautiful and everlasting tribute to two elderly people and one young man who were victims of the holocaust atrocities. It was a memorable two hours, wandering alleys and back streets in a most ancient part of the ancient city of Roma"

Just a down-to-earth shady Italian area, a surprise around every corner! We had a four year old with us and stumbled upon a neighborhood park with play equipment. We got to mingle with Italian families, though we can barely speak the language, they were all very friendly and many wanted to practice their English. We found a great gelato cafe with good bathrooms, and for dinner we found a gem called Poppi's. Excellent food, reasonably priced, great ambiance with the checkered tablecloths, etc - but not a tourist trap! We came too early (5:30 pm - Italians rarely eat before 7pm) but they accommodated us anyway. We loved just wandering around - we only wished we had more time to explore."

It was crammed with tourists and locals Saturday night but not too crowded other times. There are lots of little streets with bars and restaurants to wander round. Transport is not great but the no8 tram is a good start. It's also got a totally dysfunctional rubbish collection system - leave this out on Wednesday, that out on Friday etc. Utterly impractical for tourists so there is a fair bit of random dumping of rubbish. Other areas of Rome do it better, with rubbish and recycling bins in the streets. But we did enjoy the area. To the North is the charming Botanical Gardens and at the South end are some particularly good restaurants, some of them very reasonably priced too."

It's a maze of narrow streets lined with medieval houses (some of which look like they were renovated very thoroughly in the 19th Century). The Romanesque church in the main square (okay, piazza) is very quaint. The locals are friendly and helpful, as are some of the tourists. If you really wish to be impressed from the start, cross over by way of the Ponte Sisto. Cross the quay, enter the little plaza, and turn left. It'll take your breath away."

We planned to take the tour as per Rick Steve's guide, but we didn't make it up to Basilica Santa Maria in Trastevere, as we decided there are definitely better places still to be seen. I expected a neighborhood with small streets, as ViaDelCorso backstreets, but found a pathetic suburb. Nevertheless we drank the most expensive beer in Rome, far more expensive than in proximity of Trevi or Vatican, in a SnackBar, not a restaurant. In my opinion, having only 4 days at disposal in Rome, Trastevere is not worth to see."

It is a very safe area to wander round no matter the time of day. Would definitely stay here again. Very central location."

Time changes everything, especially in terms of the influence of mass media. Where laundry actually hangs in Naples or Catania, one gets th feeling it's put out as window dressing for the tourists to admire, though that sounds a bit smug even to myself.Less frivolously, Trastevere offers nice eating, more interesting shops and visual walking bonuses in every direction. It's best quality is its psychological juxtaposition or counterpoint to the rest of Rome that demands attention and concentrated energy, yet the layback Trestevere/Isola experience lies conveniently within a quick bus ride of the Vatican area.All roads may well have once lead to Rome, but thankfully this corner involves a road gratefully --- a bit less traveled and that --- makes all the difference."

In fact the Trastevere is much quieter place at night except you can heared sometimes people walking while talking in English loud probably because some people have been intoxicated from enjoying out but all are part of the life of people in Trastevere. The place has so many things to offer like to meet local people by eating at the local restaurants and coffee shops in the area which serves real authentic Italian food and latte machiatto.

The cobbled streets, narrow alleys, and steep hills are what comes to when one thinks of a historic European town, which Trastevere still preserves. It's located west of the city center and Palatine Hill across the Tiber, and south of the Vatican City. The best way to get here is by walking across Rome's many adorned bridges, but if you want to take the metro, buy a BIT Standard Ticket at any station for 1.50 euros, which allows you a 1-way trip of any distance (100-minute time limit is enforced if you're using the bus). Take Line B to Piramide, which then requires a 10-minute walk uphill to reach this district; Rome has the simplest public transit system in Europe because there are only 2 metro lines that run like an \"X\" through the city."

It's definitely our favorite place there. So hidden that is still not listed here in TripAdvisor, that makes even more special. They are in the heart of Trastevere (Via San Michele, 12) and they have yoga, Aikido classes for all ages, in different styles. I tried Iyengar and was super nice. My husband tried one open class of Aikido as he likes martial arts. We loved the teacher and the owners, super friendly from Milano, they have a lot of experience with Asian arts - inclusive Culinary. They invited us for a dinner and oh my god, the best food I ever had in Italy, I mean, really, in my life. They are vegetarian and vegan chefs back in Milan and they ministry cooking classes once a month in that place. We did one class one saturday and was soooo nice, funny and delicious. At the and we realized we became addicted to there... Such a nice environment, nice people from all over the world. To culminate our experience, I comented that I had a backache (from the backpack traveling) and they suggested us to do a massage in the little spa area they just inaugurated. I had a calm healing one and my husband had a shiatsu. We left the place floating... we are 'heavy users' of massage places specially in Asia and they are in the same level. You should consider visit them and discover the best place in Rome. We visit many places in Italy following their suggestion and was amazing. We were super amazed and in love with Krishna Kanta and Munindra and their amazing staff..."

It's adjacent to he Tiber River with numerous picturesque bridges, one, the Ponte Fabrico, is the oldest in Rome, built in 62 BC and still in service. The streets for the most part are narrow, cobblestone, with barely room for vehicles and simultaneous pedestrians. Small shops, highly rated restaurants, cafes line the majority of streets. There are historic churches, with amazing art and architecture seemingly around every corner. We rented an apartment that was in a building built in the 14th Century (the interior had, of course, been updated/renovated numerous times). The area reminds me of some older areas of New York's Greenwich Village but is much, much more genuine, charming and inviting.When we return to Rome, it will be to Trastevere as our \"headquarters\"."

Have been coming to Rome every 2 years since 2000 ( for the six nations rugby) and didn't know this area existed.Our hotel receptionist recommended we eat there. She said it used to be a very poor area of Rome but is now known for its numerous restaurants. She also stressed that it is a vey safe area to wander around, even very late at night.We ate at the restaurant La Miraggio a Trastevere on the Via Della Lungara which is on the edge of the area.When we return to Rome we will definitely eat here again. The atmosphere was fabulous, typical noisy Italian restaurant with lovely helpful staff. The food was great, we had deep fried stuffed zucchini flowers and fried baby squid for starters followed by seafood tagliatelle and suckling pig with saut\u00e9ed potatoes for mains washed down with a carafe of nice red house wine - absolutely delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed it but don't come here if you want a quiet romantic meal in an expensive setting."

Late night eating is always possible here, so after a heavy day doing the tourist part stop find a Trattoria to rest up & have a good meal to finish the day off.

But where to stay?Our preference is Trastevere , an authentic quarter with its cobbled streets, individualistic boutiques and a fabulous choice of dining.It is an easy walk to the city highlights ,like St Peters, the Vatican, the Forum, the Colosseum Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain but a world away from the touristic hustle and bustle .We have found a delightful boutique hotel - Le Clarisse - with just 18 rooms and that typifies this locale. It is more personal , accessible and rewarding than being amongst the bright lights of the city - and as a popular area with Romans is much better value than the central tourist zones.If you want the real Rome then discover Trastevere."

We followed our phone's map to the botanical garden but didn't bother paying the very steep price to go in (when we saw how run down that looked too, and checked the reviews here!).In all, stick to the other parts of Rome. This just feels horrible."

It's a short tour but interesting to learn about the Jewish neighborhood. Stop by to get the best fried artichokes (you can get it cheaper to go if you don't want to sit at the fancy restaurant) - look for Anthony Bourdain's picture. Then further down the street is a bakery selling an italian fruit bread fresh out of the oven (a denser pannetone), and few steps away is a shop selling groceries and really fresh foccacia by the ounce... yum. Nice little detour from the usual Piazzas and with Rick's commentary - you learn a bit about the area."

If you like to walk down the narrow streets and discover little miracles behind the corner - a church, piazza, green market, street vendors, tiny restaurants with excellent food and peculiar basements, or a memorial plaque dedicated to director Sergio Leone, who used to live in the neighborhood, then you are on the right place. You can easily and deliberately get lost in Trastevere... All it takes is to cross some of the beautiful bridges across the Tiber, Ponte Garibaldi for example...(after visiting Largo di Torre Argentina or Piazza Venezia)"

We discovered a great general market on Sunday morning in Trastevere and that kept us occupied haggling and people watching for a morning. We would stay in this area again.

We saw that he also had a walking tour of the Trastevere area, so we decided to check it out.I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the area so much if I hadn't listed to the audio and had just walked around. Yes, there is infinite charm and so many gorgeous, colorful buildings, but the tour gave some pretty cool information. It took us down back roads that we wouldn't have normally walked through and showed neat historical markers like a restaurant building (one that we would have walked past without a second glance) that had unnoticeable Hebrew markings above the columns and was actually a synagogue 1000 years ago.The podcast refers to Trastevere as a seedier part of Rome, but I didn't notice that it seemed ghetto or scary. Yes, it was a little more run down than other areas, but still full of charm and beautiful in it's own way. It's so full of history that you would miss just walking through, so make sure you google some info, grab a guidebook or tour guide, or download a podcast!"

            "review": "I heart Trastevere!. If you have ever been to Montmartre in Paris and loved it... then you will LOVE Trastevere in Rome! If you have never been to Montmartre then I will explain. Trastevere is a quaint area on the \"other\" side of the Tiber with narrow, cobbled streets and a trendy, but local, nightlife. Trastevere is not a touristy area and, as such, you will find great local restaurants (hidden gems) as opposed to tourist trap restaurants that display pictures of their food on a sign by the door. Trastevere can definitely get busy in the evenings, but you won't find street performers and kiosks selling snow globes. Piazza Navona will have all that - as well as pictures of the food :-). Personally, we found Piazza Navona crazy and left pretty immediately to get back to Trastevere.I stayed in Trastevere just last week with my husband and children (ages 8 and 11). We stayed on a quiet street and enjoyed getting lost in the streets and discovering small cafes, restaurants and shops. We are the kind of family who gets up and out early, gets our touring done, and then comes back to our local area around 5pm to chill for a few hours before a late meal. If you enjoy having that kind of downtime at the end of a long day, without all the tourist hubbub, then stay in Trastevere. And, with all the restaurants in the area, we found great places to eat right near our apartment each night. We were able to stay out late with the kids because, whenever they got tired, we only had to stumble a couple of minutes to get home.One thing people asked me when I said we would be staying in Trastevere is, \"Don't you want to be closer to everything?\" My answer is no. I don't think it's worth it. The closer to \"everything\" you stay the more touristy it is. Not to mention that nothing is really that far from anything else. I believe the Colosseum was less than 2 miles away from our apartment. It took us 35 minutes to walk there with 2 children.... which is nothing. Isn't part of the fun, walking around and taking it all in? If you don't like to walk then take a 5 minute taxi ride. Whatever suits you, but I'd rather go \"out there\" during the day to see all the sites but then come back to spend all my other free time in a place like Trastevere.I could go on and on about Trastevere. Highly recommend if you want a taste of real Roman culture. Feel free to ask about restaurant recommendations too - we found some awesome places!"

Take line H from Termini station which will drop u off at a junction in Trastevere, then walk along the narrow streets. Look for local cheese shops (Antica cIciara), local supermarket selling porchetta (la noralnelia - picture attached), and wine shops (Ristorante Spirita di vino- picture attached, a heritage winery).

It was August and the streets were full of people. I thought it would be deserted because Italians vacation and go to the beach in August. I guess these are tourists like us! And as we kept walking, we were in Trastevere. It looked familiar because we stayed here in one of our trips and enjoyed the area. I remember a local recommended Sor' Eva restaurant and after that, it was our favorite place to eat even if we no longer stayed there the years after we visited. While walking, we heard some live music from a band. We moved in the direction of the sound and we came across the bridge and the music became louder. When we looked down, we saw that there was a nightlife down there and there were lots of people going down and going up. We both screamed in glee 'Yey! We gotta see this.\" And down we went under the bridge. Wanna feel like a local and do what locals do. Come here! It will be the best Saturday night out you can have during your stay. Enjoy the river, the music, the drinks, the people you meet, the nice server. Take it all in and when you're no longer there and back in your own city, remember the memories that you have filed in your heart. And then you will want to come back again...and again...and again."

Found a fantastic Prosciutto and wine bar! Visited the area the last 3 times I was in Rome. Brought my children and husband this time and they also loved the afternoon we spent there. Less hectic than old historic Rome area because it is foot traffic only."

I would advise to plan the Trastevere visit on Sunday, so you can start with a visit to the giant Sunday Market behind the Porta Portese city gate, overflowing in the parallel streets with the flee market. Furthermore, returning from the market and entering the historic part of Trastevere through the city wall, the charming atmosphere of Trastevere with the narrow cobble-stoned streets will strike you immediately. One drawback: You are not alone, for Trastevere is a tourist magnet, individual tourists and tour groups alike. Trastevere is awash with bars, restaurants, artists shops etc. Be careful when sitting down in a bar or restaurant for a drink or a snack. Like other tourist hot spots in Italy, there is a large difference in price having your consumption standing at the bar or sitting at a table (\"Bar\" or \"Tavolo\" prices). Fortunately, in Italy it is compulsory to display the prices. Don't forget to visit the main square, Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, and the beautiful church, Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere. A day well spent."

San Cosimoto where there is a market Monday through Saturday. We were charmed and delighted at the friendliness and the good produce, cheese, pasta, meat, fish and bread. The next day we were out going to a museum and walked back early evening through the main square which is Santa Maria Di Trastevere and were shocked to see scads of visitors, hawkers ((who had identical items). The charming little workshops, artist studios and stores of our memory were gone.Well we discovered not exactly gone but relocated to the other side of Lungaterra Trastevere which is the big street that cuts across Trastevere. On the \"non touristy\" side, there are small trattorias, workshops, bookstores, bakeries and quiet streets. We found our old Trastevere at last."

My friend and I ate at an Osteria there that had real wooden tables. I cannot remember the last time that I have been in a restaurant that had anything made of real wood! Our small table for two had hundreds--perhaps thousands--of names and initials carved into it. I learned upon arriving home that in Trastavere, there are people who still speak Latin! This surprised me as I had learned as a teen that Latin was a \"dead language\"; meaning that it was no longer spoken (excluding Latin Masses, of course). I wish I had known this fact prior to my trip as I attended a strict Catholic school that required us to learn to both pray and sing hymns in English, French, and Latin. It would have been fun to try out some of that Latin. I highly suggest going to Trastavere not only to see a different side of Rome, but because there is a great little information center there with lots of brochures. You will encounter it on your right-hand side almost immediately upon entering Trastavere. I wouldn't call it an actual building as it is more of a glass enclosure. You can't miss it!"

This is definitely a bohemian area with some interesting sights. We started by crossing the Sixto Bridge over the Tiber and went to Villa Farnese, one of the homes of the famous family. We did not go inside. Behind the Villa are the Orte Botanico which, given more time, I would like to have visited. We then walked towards Piazza Sta Maria di Trastevere, stopping at one of the street cafes for coffee and people watching. The Church was closed and the piazza underwhelming. Crossed through the market place and east of Via di Trastevere to see 2 churches, St. Francis of Assisi (closed until 2pm) and Sta. Cecilia. This latter was the highlight of my visit to Trastevere. It is a small modest church. You pass into a courtyard of flowers and a fountain which is very peaceful and into the small chapel. Befitting her reputation as the patron saint of music, there were a group of nuns on the altar chanting their prayers. We sat for awhile to take it in and then headed back along the Tiber to the Vatican. Maybe Trastevere is an evening venue for young people and restaurants but it failed to \"wow\" us. It was very much a middle class residential neighbour much as we could find at home."

The second time we focused on the area around Santa Maria in Trastevere. The church itself is marvelous with a coffered ceiling and beautiful marble mosaic floor. While not without its tourists, this area is a far cry from the hustle and bustle of much of Rome and was my favorite area to stroll.

We had spent a lot of time walking around Central Rome, going to restaurants on tourist squares and kept getting caught out with nice views but below average service at above average prices. We went to Trastevere hoping for a Camden type, neighbourhood district feel and we got exactly that! It's a great part of town to kill time people watching, browsing quirky market stalls (1 guy was selling postcards from a collection over the last 50-70 years that had actually been sent to him and others!) and for finding a much truer feel to what it might be like to live in Rome these days. It's still touristy but way less stressful. I bought some local Limoncello and had a fantastic lunch with the best service we had in Italy across 5 cities. Cannot recommend enough! Go here, wander and explore. Great photo opportunities too ;) Ps. we walked from the Pantheon over a nearby bridge and it took us about 30 minutes. We walk everywhere and so should you (if you can!)"

We then walked to 3 different family shops to taste melt in your mouth porchetti & other pork products; a cheese shop and later a biscotti shop and bakery. All have been in existence for more than 25 years and well patronized. The biscotti were such a lovely assortment it was hard not to buy a little of a number of them. We also went to lunch at a restaurant which was tucked away down a small street. It had the four walls of a 2000 year old synagogue but was built out by surrounding buildings. We had a very good pasta lunch with a an accompanying wine - red or white. Very enjoyable. Afterwards we were taken to the basement to see the many layers of civilization to be seen in the walls - truly astounding and such a find! Romans through the ages kept building on top of the previous civilisations. Loved it all. The walking tour lead was excellent & shared her knowledge freely."

The Trastevere quarter is charming, narrow streets, mostly 2-4 story buildings and pirroresque squares.Trastevere used to be a hidden gem, with lots of small restaurants and little shops.During the past years however, the number of tourists in Trastevere increased dramatically.Prices (of most bars and restaurants) went up and are now comparable with for instance the Campo dei Fiori at the other side of the Tiber river.If you've got plenty of time in Rome, you can visit Trastevere. If you are in a hurry, forget it and concentrate on Rome's major attractions."

I bought a lovely unique necklace at one of the vendors (they are willing to negotiate price). For dinner we had an authentic pizza dinner accompanied with a salad and a bottle of prosecco for a very reasonable price (the bottle of prosecco was only 12 Euros). Definitely worth a visit...best to go in the evening as it is vibrant and lively."

Its fun for a few hours, but having been to Rome over 25 times, I can't say that I loved the area.

We rented a quite nice little apartment on the 3. floor of Vicolo del Bologna 15 in Trastevere, Rome. But, over severel days, there were problems with the shower - the water ran down to the neighbor below, so we could not shower for a period of severel days. Thats not funny in Rome in the middle of the summer. After plummers finally have fixed the shower, the toilet stopped. The owner Signorita Anna was nice, but did not offer us another place to stay. Maybe she did not have any other free apartment ( she has 3 on rent basis ), but what should we do ? We were called home because of an emergency 3 days before the ordinary travel home, and the call came in fact very convenince, regarding the bad pipes in the apartment, pipes which the last day delivered a very bad smell of toilet all over the apartment. It was not suitable to eat, sleep or stay in at all. The owner offered a refund of 100 euro, which we found was to little for 3-4 days of distress. Not been able to shower or use the toilet is not a relaxed vacation. The plummers couldnt take care of before 2 days after, at one time. The owner didnt even answer my calls the first many hours after the toilet stopped, and the shower was appartly connected to the same pipes as the shower, so there was something i cant mention here also in the shower...Thats not good enough."

Neighborhoods like Trastevere are much more interesting to me (especially during high-tourist mob season) than the iconic monument sites in any major tourist-destination city. Neighborhoods like this are much quieter, the restaurants are more typical (and cheaper) and food quality is better, too. This is a great neighborhood for wandering any time of day and late into the evening. It is very much a residential neighborhood, but there are lots of shops and restaurants as well. I never figured-out the bus system in Rome, so I walked everywhere. Rome is not big on benches to rest your weary feet, so wear comfortable shoes! Be sure to use the restroom when you stop in a caf\u00e9 for water or coffee or food. Public restrooms are non-existent."

San Francesco a Ripa Grande houses a Bernini masterpiece sculpture, while Santa Maria Cecilia and Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere make for beautiful church visits. Many enjoy staying in Trastevere based hotels but you can also conveniently visit this area of Rome, via the bridges that link to Campo de Fiori and Aventine areas of the city centre.

It was simply a great area from which to explore the city. Great little restaurants were nearby, as were coffee shops, grocery stores, museums, churches, the night market by the Tiber, and many more attractions. I would return in the blink of an eye. The fact that on weekends the area was popular until thee wee hours of the morning with young folks on scooters did not bother us a bit. Comes with being trendy. :-)"

By day you'll find good coffee shops and some great shopping boutiques down Via di S. Francesco a Ripa. At night the area comes alive with masses of people descending on the major thoroughfare Viale Trastevere. Yes, there are lots of bars and restaurants around here but beware, along Viale Trastevere and also Via della Lungaretta, there is also a lot of places that cater to tourists who are visiting the area briefly (except Pizzaria Ai Marmi which does amazing Roman pizzas with slightly offhand service). Generally, you'll do much better on the quieter side of Trastevere i.e. go the opposite direction to the Viale Trastevere crowd. A number of the really highly rated Trastevere restaurants are in this quieter section of Trastevere up near Santa Cecilia. During the day you can wonder the narrow cobblestone streets and feel like you are a local away from the tourist mayhem of Rome. You can also take in a number of very historical churches - Santa Maria of Trastevere is one of the oldest churches in Rome and has beautiful mosaics. The area has a number of touching local things that you don't see everywhere in Rome - like the little gold stars on the footpath outside a house where a Jewish family was removed during the Second World War - outside the house there is one star for each family member that died during the Holocaust, just something the community did to remember them. That's Trastevere for me, rather than the raucous nightlife of Viale Trastevere."

Perfectly picturesque...imagine the cool River Tiber running past on a stuffy hot night, and finding a white canopied world under the arches of the bridges on the waters edge. Yes, the market stalls aren't bargains, reflected in the touristy tat mixed in with locals playing arcade games, and the left side of the stalls were definitely better than those to the right of the bridge, BUT, it is still worthwhile going down for a break from \"Above ground Rome.\" The food tends to be more eclectic with Mexican, kebab and American food, catering to both tourists and locals every evening. The food isn't excellent, this isn't the Gourmet pop ups we had expected. We ate at a Mexican/American restaurant which looked amazing. Imagine the white canopied tents, couches, white painted furniture to match the picket fences with planters hanging over the waters edge filled with pink flowers, who could resist?! To be honest, we should of! Between the four of us, we had 2 Margareitas, 2 soft drinks, and 4 main courses. One was a portion of Nachos, unfortunately full of mince to a rather miffed Vegetarian, 2 had the Vegetarian Quesdillas, which weren't the flat dry fried versions we are acustomed to at home, but more like microwaved rolled up wraps bursting with stringy Mozerella, and poorly chopped and unevenly distributed jalape\u00f1os! I had chicken fajitas. Chicken was moist, but it was drenched in sauce, and you only had one wrap. So the rest was like eating a tomatoey curry with the remaining rice and salad. We went on to later visit Trastevere during the day time (See other reviews!) and I still reccomend you go to the summer night markets, but be prepared to not be overwhelmed. Just enjoy the atmosphere."

There are some notable sights : Santa Maria in Trastevere,being one of them. We spent the entire evening eating, drinking and people watching. Before going back to our apartment, we descended steps to the bank of the river where there were literally more than a kilometer of markets housed under white tentlike structures,selling everything from jewellery to foodstuffs. Here, too, hundreds and hundreds of people were sitting at various eateries strung along the river. What a buzz!"

We had lunch at a fantastic cafe just before the main church (Maria?) in the square - there are several little churches but this one is spectacular inside. The pizzeria where we ate was one of the best meals we had, and the cheapest! Proper authentic freshly cooked Italian fare and very pleasant, comical young men waiting on. There is the occasional little workshop and the whole feel is bohemian. We got a taxi to the Vatican from there and it was only 10\u20ac for the four of us which saved our poor feet.

Some said \"don't go there, kinda dirty and can be dangerous.\" Oh please! I can't imagine staying anywhere else! We had a magnificent 3 bedroom apartment just down the street from the Cabot University and the prison that houses some of the Mafia. There is nightlife and more nightlife; restaurants and bars and gelato shops and mini-marts and cafes - did I mention nightlife? We walked everywhere while in Rome, day and night and never once felt threatened or unsafe. The town can get a little littered with bottles and general trash but it gets cleaned up (for the most part). Fantastic little restaurants, walk-up pizza places, fine dining, great cafes and wonderful food. The city of Rome (proper) is a walk over the Tiber River. When we would be out traveling the city via foot, we couldn't wait to come back to Trastevere to relax, people watch eat and drink. Highly recommend and don't let the reviews of pick-pockets or whatever else people are saying scare you off. Pick pockets are everywhere in the world. Just be an \"aware tourist\" and you will be fine. This is where you will experience the real \"Roman\" way of life. Also, if your apartment does not have laundry service, there is a coin operated laundry mat about 20-25 minute walk from Cabot University. Locals will be able to direct you."

Compared to Piazza Navona, it's less upscale, less expensive, and less touristy, but it has even greater charm and a very vibrant nightlife. Old buildings, many covered with bougainvillea, narrow winding streets, many really nice cafes/bars, restaurants and shops. The Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere (where the Basilica is located) is a fantastic place to sit and watch the world (priests, nuns, locals, tourists) go by. One morning, we watched as the local restaurants retrieved large trays of porcini mushrooms from the produce trucks, and chatted with an old man who sat in a doorway and cleaned them carefully. Trastevere is also within an easy walk of the Piazza Navona, the Pantheon and other attractions. Few hotels, but many apartment rentals are possible. We strongly recommend this area for those who want to stay in a real neighborhood."

Trastevere is very interesting, there are some cultural sites, churches, tiny winding streets; it is, as a rule, somewhat less touristy (but not by much) than say Colosseum or central Rome's forums. Trastevere is filled with everyday activities, but we honestly failed to experience the much-touted authenticity or unique character of this Roman neighborhood. It is not exactly that the Centro Storico of the right bank of Rome doesn't have its real-city population, and real people living their real lives. The rest of historical Rome unequivocally has much more exciting sites, much more interesting architecture, a vast complex of museums and ancient Roman ruins. So Trastevere's appeal remains by and large a mystery for us.That is not to say that a walk of Trastevere is not going to be worth your time. It is positively different and without it, one's perception of Rome won't be complete. We would recommend to start your tour from Tiber Island (that is if you don't stay in Trastevere), cross Ponte Cestio and, walking under the arch of the picturesque Via dell\u2019Arco de\u2019 Tolomei, get to St Cecilia church. From there, head to Via della Lungaretta, lined with restaurants and little shops, and reach Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere. Go inside the church Santa Maria in Trastevere. Upon exiting the square's north side, follow Via della Scala to admire the ancient Porta Settimiana (a part of the Aurelian walls in Rome), and finish by magnificent Villa Farnesina. Do not combine a walk in Trastevere with climbing Gianicolo, for the latter requires a separate visit and touring both in one stretch would result in sensory overburden. Recommended."

I wont deny that the place has a vibe but I strongly belive the city does not know how to protect and enhance it.The while district is a numbernor narrow streets where a huge crowd of people is running away from the cars that barely fit the narrow passage anyways. And if it is not enough by itself the streets are packed with obstackles like chairs and tables of the million plus one ristorante and rugs immigrants display their fake junk on.Add to this equation that the walls of the buildings aren't aged nicely. They dont look like cool and ancient but rather run down and simply old.Other than this you can find a bit of a magic walking around. Once in a while you can stumble on a sweet little piazza to get a cold gelato and then it is kinda worth it."

This area is close (walking distance) to all of the sights (Colosseum, Vatican, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Roman Forum etc) but is the best place to eat (it's where all the locals go to eat) and it is not completely overridden by tourists, so you can still move/walk about easily and its a quiet place to sleep (if you choose you accommodation well) We ate some GREAT meals in this area. The first time I was in Rome, I left feeling a little disappointed with the food, (found out later I ate in all the wrong areas at all the wrong places) but not this time around. If you don't like to walk, the tram line runs along the main street here and you can jump on and it will take you where you need to go....or close to it! If you don't stay here, make sure you come here to eat!! Trip advisor has some good recommendations for this area."

Be sure to try a salad of pear and Parmesan drizzled with honey. So simple but amazing! I was happy to see all restaurants we went to catered for coeliacs or 'sanza glutene'.

At night, natives and tourists alike flock to its many pubs and restaurants, but much of the original character of Trastevere remains. Trastevere is the 13th rione of Rome, on the west bank of the Tiber, south of Vatican City. Its name comes from the Latin trans Tiberim, meaning literally \"beyond the Tiber\"."

Someone once said: \"When you are in Rome, behave as Romans!\" Following the citizens of Rome example, I set out for Trastevere, curious to explore how locals spend their leisure hours.This place is unusual for Rome, arouses bohemian sensitivity, gives you an impression of bygone centuries and invites you to experience charm of Trastevere's timelessness cafes. Here you will not find attractiveness of Piazza Navona, often used for commercial purposes, proud past of the ancient Rome, baroque richness of Roman fountains or trendy cafes. But, you will find comfort and shelter for tired tourist getting away from hustle and bustle of Rome during afternoon hours. You could connect visits to Vatican and Trastevere, because both are located in neighborhood. The good idea is combination of tourist bus on&off and walking. When you get at Vatican by tourist bus, visit it and make a break there, then you could continue to Trastevere on foot. The walk along river Tiber decorated with its charming bridges provides you a romantic pleasure, particularly in the spring. The chic cafes, remarkable by their character, offer drinks at reasonable prices and decorate narrow streets. The pricey shops will learn you very soon that bohemianism could be paid at high price. If you are woman/girl, you will see Trastevere offers numerous shopping opportunities and you will set your eyes on beautiful fashionable bags and shoes that you will make a wish to have!In any case, reward yourself with a visit to this part of the City, pick on some chic cafe as I did and enjoy bohemian mood! Because, when you are in Rome, behave as Romans!"

This was near the bus driver and the people stopped him moving forward while going through his shoulder bag and taking 100 euros. They jumped off at the next stop.

We'd been on a night walking tour in Rome previously and really enjoyed our guide's background information. He pointed out little things we probably would not have noticed on our own. Local knowledge is a wonderful thing. Being with a small group also provided us with a sense of security as night time can be intimidating for those of us not as young as we once were. Having said that Trastevere lends itself to walking and exploring at one's own rate. Although off the main tourist track Trastevere offers much for the visitor to Rome and, though nowhere near as crowded as the hot spots across the Tiber or at the Vatican, there were quite a few people wandering the night we were there. It is a very picturesque old area with narrow laneways that open onto cobbled squares, gorgeous Renaissance buildings some almost completely covered in ivy. In one tiny laneway the ivy was draped across the walkway forming a green canopy overhead. There are many lovely shops, eateries and piazzas to explore. Many restaurants are frequented by the locals and there is a lovely \"family\" feel to the area. The beauty of walking at night is that it is much cooler and the lights bathe everything in a romantic glow. Crossing the Tiber just as the lights were coming on was magical. On our walk we visited Santa Cecilia, the 9th century monastic church and were there in time to listen to the nuns' singing evening Mass. Something very special. In Piazza Santa Maria a small band was playing and there was a carnival atmosphere.The mosaics inside the basilica Santa Maria were amazing. It is quite easy to get to Trastevere by public transport. It is about a 10 minute return trip to Palazza Venetia or by walking across Ponte Sublicio along Via Marmorata to metro Pyramide. From metro Circo Massimo walk along Via Del Circo Massimo towards the Tiber and cross into Trastevere over Ponte Palatino. You get a really good view of the ruined Ponte Rotto from this bridge. Or walk a little further beside the river on Lungotevere Aventino until you reach Ponte Cestio and explore Isola Tiberina before crossing into Trastevere."

A lot is made of it being the \"real\" Rome - while it is undoubtedly more representative of how the city used to be a good while ago, I think claiming this makes it the real rome is misleading. The sudden appearance of flashing neon signs (pharmacies, etc.) does somewhat spoil the old feeling when exploring. That said, it is an interesting place to wander around - lots of old housing, interspersed with pleasant churches, small Piazzas and a rather large school (avoid the end of the school day!). There are restaurants that appear out of nowhere, some of them quite good, others more touristy. Try ones a little away from the main attractions (Santa Maria, for example) and you should do better. There are lots of little streets here that can be a little disorientating at first, but nowhere is too far from the main streets either side and the river, so it is easy to locate yourself with a few minutes walk."

In deciding where to stay, we struggled with staying in the middle of the city center where everything is at, or just outside, but still walking distance. We are so happy with went with the Trastavere neighborhood - quieter, hardly any traffic, GREAT restaurants, a little nightlife in the Piazza Santa Maria Trastavere. It is a bit of a walk though...probably 30 minutes up to Villa Borghese & Spanish Steps area (about 2 miles), moving at a decent pace. And it was probably 30 minutes to the Colosseum. Vatican was much closer since it is also on the west side of the river. If you stay out here, get a map and go to the church at the top of the hill, then keep going up another 10 minutes to the lookout. Great exercise, and great views.If I return, I would stay in this neighborhood again because the I just don't care for the crazy traffic in the main area. And did I mention GREAT restaurants???"

While rest of main Rome is hustle and bustle, Trastevere is more of people friendly section with some of the most iconic beautiful alleys that Rome has to offer. Pro-tip: See the big sites of Rome then get a taxi to Trastevere for a relaxing stroll through the alleys then pick a restaurant with a menu only in Italian if possible, we all know what spaghetti, or what a margherita pizza is. So a menu in only Italian suggest a good restaurant FOR local Italians! Avoid tourist traps with menus in 4 different languages! Try the delicious \"Suppli\" if possible, it's a fried ball of rice, with mozzarella cheese inside. You'll thank me later!"

The church of Santa Maria was also fascinating with its mismatched columns stolen from Roman sites.

That was a huge mistake as we walked up and down streets in this neighborhood attempting to find a suitable restaurant. (We always look for the TripAdvisor sign.) A noticeable difference in Rome is the street hawkers to get you into their restaurant. This was also true in Trastevere. It is a charming area and doesn't have the large mobs of tourists in the heart of Rome but we did not make the most of our time there not knowing exactly where to go. (We ended up at a restaurant on a small street, facing walls of graffiti during dinner.)

The neighborhood is ever changing. Mornings start slowly with clean up from the previous night's revelry, and gradually by 10 things open up with coffee and cornetti. The market in the main piazza is open from 7 until 1:30 or so. By 1:30 the restaurants are in full swing, tables on the streets and in the piazza. But by 3, the neighborhood is quiet again and many places are closed. At 6 or 7 is when things really get going: tables lining all the streets, bars open, music, performers, hawkers, and the streets packed with people, the occasional car or motorbike squeezing through. We stayed in Trastevere in September and the party in the streets happened 7 nights a week, always until about 2 AM. It's a fun and colorful place to visit. La Boticella and Pianostrada Laboratoriodicucina were our favorite restaurants. One word of caution: The streets are very noisy until 2 every night. If you are staying in this area, you most likely will listen to the racket until the wee hours. And it can get loud with strolling accordion players, drummers. crowds singing in bars, music thumping. Not for light sleepers!"

We were lucky to stay at the Hotel Santa Maria and there is not a thing we would have changed. Other than the ballet at Caracalla, we walked everywhere including the Forum, Pantheon, Castel Sant'Angelo and other sites. But, coming back to Trastevere was like crossing the bridge from Boston to Cambridge...less intense and more relaxed and real.

We enjoyed the Italian version of \"happy hour\" in the evening hours where you pay one price for a drink (in our case it was 8 Euro) and were able to have a one-plate pass through the appetizer buffet. It made for a great light dinner. The later it gets the more the locals come out to enjoy the evening. Also, along that section of the Tevere river, a summertime festival runs along the riverbank for several kilometers with tents. There are temporary bars, clubs, shops and entertainment.

We then had some delicious Casalare wine in the ancient cellar of Santo Spirito. The cookies (especially the \"ugly\" ones) were amazing at Innocenti. We saw pizza and bread being made but it wasn't very good. We had three amazing pasta dishes at Osteria del Belli. The fried rice ball from a local street shop was eh. The final stop for gelato was a sweet way to end the night. My favorite stop wasn't food related. We went to a \"secret\" farmacia in an old church - very cool.

But there are still plenty of locals-- many of whom own and run the excellent local restaurants found in this little community. When I'm in Rome, I try to visit both during the day and at night. The photographic possibilities are endless."

The square was a complete surprise with lovely caf\u00e9s, bistros and pizzerias. The fountain was great for photos and the church of santa Maria is one of the best in the whole of Rome. We also chose to eat every night in Trastevere (along the main road) and were not disappointed. One night, at the nearest end to the bridge, we entered a very inconspicuous church and had the most amazing intimate experience. We were asked to write down our prayers and wishes and were then guided by an Italian lady to the front of the church to place them on the alter. We then said a prayer and walked back through the singing and clapping, small congregation, noticing an embalmed bishop/priest on display in a small chapel off to the side. Very strange but amazing and one if the most incredible memories! Having seen Rome, read reviews and hoping to return soon there is no doubt I would only stay in Trastevere. (We stayed at the Ripa Hotel, review is on here, would definitely recommend)"

But an area with no tourists is probably not worth visiting. There are tourists of course, and many of them, there is just not tourist bus tourists. There also lots of American students due to the universities in the area.The area has much graffiti, a bit noise at night and Of course it also has Bangladeshi hawkers, but so does every where else. But it has an edge and vibe that is not evident in the other areas of town.The graffitied rollers come up at night to reveal great places to drink and eat."

I was expecting lower to middle class Italians out and about and like I mentioned loads of clothes hanging from balconies the way I have seen in videos and photos. I did not see this. It looks sort of like what Old Town Alexandria in Virginia looks like, a mix of touristy cafes and well to do residents living there. I know it was the middle of the day, but I was expecting a more middle class village. NOT. A lot of tourists like me walking along with the gelato shops and Bangladesh street vendors hawking their wares. I was sort of teed off because we spent 2 hours walking from the Vatican area looking for this place and getting lost! But they do have cheap tourist cafes to rest and eat from!"

Not a far walk from the main part of the city but much nicer to have lunch in. We ate in a pizzeria down a side street and it was my best meal in Rome. We then sat in the main square which is also beautiful and listened to the people playing music after visiting the best ice-cream shop or gelateria Ive ever been to - 'Blue Ice' (snickers is a must try). There are lots of trash vendors as in ALL parts of the city and some real tourist trap restaurants where they try to coax you in. If you go down the narrow streets off the main piazza or square you will find much better places to eat filled with locals. This area was recommended to us as the best place for food and drinks in rome by the girl working in our hostel."

The Tiber was in view out our window and the bridge was a blast every night. Lots of people, lots of culture and the Trevi was a 10 min walk. To get to the Trevi, it took 1 turn. Cross the bridge, and turn at the pantheon. The best at night time, still active, but a lot less tourist in the way. Just watch out for all the Indians trying to sell you elastic neon flying helicopters and dancing cats, they mean well and provided a lot of memories. Awesome atmosphere and happy people.

We had booked a room in Trastevere for the entire (save one night) stay, and we did not regret that decision for one minute. Trastevere is a real neighbourhood full of character and characters that still manages to feel homey and safe, yet is only a twenty minute walk to the major sites of Rome, including the Jewish Ghetto! We felt we had the best of both worlds, and, after trekking all over the eternal city (including one visit via underground to Cinecitta), we could leave the hubbub of the rest of Rome and go to our (comparatively) quiet, yet lively, neighbourhood. There is much to see just in Trastevere, as we discovered every day. The lovely piazzas alone are fun just to hang out in. On our last day, we bought porchetta panino, and took a bus up to the top of Gianicolo (Janiculum) to eat our picnic lunch and have a look over Rome, before walking back down hill. What a lovely experience! We did quite a bit of shopping in Trastevere, including some food shopping at a beautiful shop on via Natale, Innocenzi, a throwback to a more gentle and genteel time. Would we go back? You bet we will! My sister wants to buy an apartment there, should she win the lottery!"

We used the neighborhood as a home base. It was a GREAT neighborhood for local nightlife and great local restaurants (not touristy and decent prices. I didn't see too many hotel's in this neighborhood, but it's easy to find an apt to let online. I'd suggest this neighborhood to visit or stay if you like areas similar to the Village in NYC. Artsy, fun shops, great local food and restaurants - all kinds from cafe's to nice sit down. If you head to the main square in Trastevere on a Fri or Sat night, there will be tons of people in the street late night, and usually bands playing, street music, etc. We LOVed staying here, but I'd say that it's not super convenient to all of the major tourist attractions (thus the 4 instead of 5 stars). You can catch a tram (#2 I believe) from the main st. in Trastevere that will take you right down to the main area near the Forum and Colleseum (About 5 tram stops and a few blocks walk). If you don't mind public transportation, and a little walking, and want to stay in a fun, happening town (probably one of the more authentic with locals in rome)... visit or stay in Trastevere!"

The locals flock to its restaurants and bars at night. It hosts the oldest church in Rome which is not to be missed (and I'm not much of a sightseer). I prefered it over St Peter's as a experience. Of course you have to go to the Vatican but its a factory and it is hard to be intimate with the history. The streets of Trastevere are narrow and often blocked to traffic so only pedestrians can enter (walking around? watch for those stone traffic blocks you can easily trip over them) If you are staying here get an upper floor room so you have some insulation from the noise at night. Its mostly the noise of people talking at bars and restaurants, not auto noise, but it is a big crowd so it is loud. If you need to close the windows to silence the din you'd better have A/C in all but the coolest months. If you can find your way to a rooftop veranda (our AirBNB apt had one) you will love the view overlooking Trastevere and Rome beyond."

This area represents authentic Rome. The adventure lies in exploring the cobblestone alleys and boutiques. I bought some lovely purses here at a small shop on Via Della Scala (Acquisto?) with competitive prices and a very helpful shop owner. Like the rest of Rome, the streets are a spiderweb so it was not easy to navigate. While we had a map, it was more functional to just wander. We had the best lunch at The MIrror Pizza. This would be a fantastic area to come for dinner - great food at bargain prices. Our $15 euro lunch included a salad with Gorgonzola cheese, pears, and walnuts, pastry with vegetables inside, drinks, and the most amazing bruschetta. I don't know what made this so good but it was a standout! This is not an area to go if you are looking for major tourist attractions, but if you are done with those and looking for a relaxing afternoon with some authentic Italian food and shopping, this is a great spot. Don't expect to find designer row here. It's more like a hidden boutique shopping adventure."

Its so refreshingly different from the streets full of DSLR totting tourists around the usual spots and even the not so muted Campo de Fiori eateries. The cobbled streets, overgrowing vines, small cafes and absence of souvenir shops make it a pleasant experience. Enjoyed a good meal at Da Otello, on Vicolo del Bologna, and would totally recommend that. Piazza Di Santa Maria was buzzing with street performers and lots more eating options.

We stayed in an inexpensive apartment in the Via Dei Riari, three minutes walk through the Porta Settimiana.

Live Italian music is played in the streets and by the restaurants by street musicians. There are also many stalls selling items such as jewellery and people in the area are friendly as in the rest of Rome. We happened to be walking past a church and a few boys aged around 16 from Mexico came to stop us so that we go and pray with them.

If you go, be sure to get outside the tourist hub part of Trastevere...wander AWAY from the Piazza Santa Maria di Trastevere (once you can tear yourself away from the beautiful stone mosaics on the floor of this spectacular and intimate church)...Stroll south to Piazza San Cosimato in the AM and get fresh fruits and panini from the AM outdoor market. Sit in the playground on the piazza and eat your panini lunch, while watching local grandparents supervise their grand-children as they frolic on the play equipment. Take a strool farther up the hill to Villa Sciarra, a lovely park overlooking Trastevere. Meander over to the other side of Viale Trastevere and see the Bernini sculptures and catacombs in that less visited part of TRastevere...This is one neighborhood where tourists, local Trasteverinos, Italian actors, artists and workers and John Cabot international students all brush elbows...for better or for worse. We would not live or base ourselves anywhere else in Rome but here!"

Well recommended for travelling to Rome, rather than merely ticking the Big Items off the bucket list."

The area smelled. it was dirty and there was nothing authentic Italy aside from the old buildings, chruches and roadways. Total Tourist Trap. Walk just 3 minutes outside the area for a real coffee at half the price and 20 minutes outside of this area prices drop to half, with much better shopping options and real Italian food. I tried a few of the high rated restaurants but couldn't find a good meal; prepackaged, rehydrated and prebottled. Hounded by beggars and musicians for change and more English speaking people than Italian. It was okay to walk through for a few hours but I will definitely not be staying in this area again."

Great night life and fun to just walk around an people watch. We ate dinner here every night. Was great to end the day close by to our apartment. The only downside I would say is that there is no Metro stop so if you don't want to walk, you have to learn which buses to take. That being said, I love to walk. We walked everywhere, even to the Piazza de Spagna. It took us about 20-30 minutes to walk to the Coliseum. Bring really comfortable shoes (like tennis shoes). I was trying to be more fashionable and did not bring tennis shoes for the daytime and that was a mistake."

So much fun to walk around and get lost in the small street and see museums and coffee bars to sit and people watch. I didn't want to leave but I know I will be back."

I would frequently spend my evenings in Trastevere, where the food is terrific and the streets are lively at night and romantic in a very Roman way. You can find restaurants all across the price scale. Don't bother looking for Chinese or Thai, it's Rome after all and Italian cuisine rules - and rocks too. It's easy to walk to Trastevere from Piazza Navona, Piazza di Spagna, or many other centers of touristic interest. The walk is particularly lovely in the early evening when the light is magical. Walking helps tune up the appetite as well. Eating out in Rome tends to be on the later side, which gives you plenty of time to wander first. Have a drink at a cafe if your tummy rumbles. That's a great experience too."

It makes my heart smile. I loved meandering the streets here in the evenings. Some of the best food I had in Rome was in Trastevere. Go to Roma Sparita and enjoy their signature Cacio e Pepe with a bottle of Frascati. Ristorante Spirito DiVino is an absolute must! Family run (the father runs the place and he will give you the history of the building and describes the menu to you in detail and in your native language, the mother cooks, and son handles the wine) and some seriously delicious food - I had the pork which was, supposedly, from a recipe that was passed down from the favorite chef of Julius Ceasar - delicious. After dinner, the host will insist you visit his wine cellar - which is older than the Colosseum - and insists you take your wine and take your time there. :) If you want a true Roma experience and aren't afraid of some walking (we walked everywhere while in Rome from our base here) then I highly recommend staying here. It is a wonderful thing to be able to escape the crowds of tourists. Even if you choose not to stay here, at the very least go. Have dinner - have an adventure! Enjoy yourself!"

At night the vendors are out, the fruit stands are busy and restaurants alive!! Twisting narrow streets emptying into small piazzas holding churches, monuments or staircases to sit on. Try Da Poeta for Pizza somewhere between the style in Naples and Rome or Casetta De'Trastevere for inexpensive and flavorful Roman fare. The river in the summer is great-White tent covered Hooka bars, futball tables, all types of food- Indian, Asian and Mexican( not typical in Rome). Just strool along and take it all in. Lots of shops set up. This is the place to see and be seen. Everyone is friendly and happy here, and why not?"

After dinner, explore the narrow cobble streets and check out the little shops and boutiques or get yourself a nice gelato for desert."

It's very quite and feels so far from all the hassle of central Rome.Also, this is a place to eat! Massive choice of gorgeous restaurants offering authentic Italian food at VERY IMPRESSIVE prices!"

Very Italian, lots of elegant, ivy-covered walls and romantic, cobblestone alleys. It ticks all the boxes for your Roman dream. Everyone says to come here to experience \"real\" Rome, so you do - along with every other tourist in city. I admit, I felt a little ludicrous wandering the streets once I realised that every other single person I saw was also a tourist doing the same thing. I felt like I was walking some movie set - the place was empty except for us tourists. We were all trying to do something different and ended up being absolute clones of each other and with not a local in sight! However, I think this was mostly because they were all at work, so probably the place is a little more authentic and 'vibe-y' in the evenings and on weekends."

When in Rome, you MUST go to Trastevere, eat, shop, sip and people watch there.

Nothing remarkable but there are one or two buildings and restaurants that would not look out of place in a Sicilian Mafioso movie. We did find a good restaurant away for the tourist part of Trastevere. Word of caution, when we went the Tram service from Largo di Torre Argentina was not running and it did not look as if it had been for some time. It is however only a short walk across the bridge over the River Tiber to get to Trastavere. The banks of the Tiber did look a bit trashy and appear to be where a lot of the young people go to drink and socialise."

The little square around Ponte Sisto is full of Italians in the evening, sitting on the stairs of the fountain and enjoying the night with some wine and pizza. Ponte Garibaldi Bridge is another nice spot to walk around. Trestevere is quiet near to Campo De Fiori and Plazza Navona.

It is a real little haven of peace and calm and so welcomed after having been in the heavily touristic areas of Rome. The pretty narrow streets are full of lively restaurants, bars and small quality boutiques. It has a more authentic feel than many other areas of Rome. Do not forget to visit some of the churches in the area, particularly the magnificent Santa Maria in Trastevere in the Piazza of the same name, but be mindful of the opening hours. They\u2019ll be closed at night if you are just coming to the area for dinner. I had some of the best pizza in Rome in a tiny little hole in the wall in this neighborhood but there are also loads of casual and chic places to choose from so something for everyone. Warning to women, it is better if you are not wearing heels, the space between the cobblestones in some area is frighteningly large. You risk ruining your shoes or getting stuck and twisting an ankle or worse. Woody Allen showcased Trastevere is his latest film, \u201cTo Rome with Love\u201d.

But having lived through the desecration of New York and Chicago when graffiti artists were considered inspired, I fail to see the charm in Trastevere in 2012."

We then visited the church Sta Maria in Trastevere. Afterwards we proceeded on to Orto Botanico which was a very nice botanic garden split up in sections such as the rose garden, the cane garden, the Japanese garden etc. There was a small entrance fee of \u20ac4 but it was worth it. After that we took a walk on the Gianicolo where at the top of the hill you see a lovely view of Rome.

It did not disappoint! We felt we were living amongst real Romans, in a real working neighborhood, and the experience was completely authentic. Easy to get around on foot, and navigate into Vatican City & the heart of Rome by local bus. The architecture of the homes and apartment houses was very unique. We especially enjoyed taking photos of all the beautiful front doors, each and every one a work of art. Our teens enjoyed the Trastevere nightlife and they felt entirely safe going out on warm evenings to mingle with the young locals. We discovered several charming bistros and gelaterias within a block or two of our apartment, and the locals were extremely welcoming. Would highly recommend finding a vacation rental/apartment in Trastevere over a hotel in the inner city. Live like the Romans do!"

There are exceptional churches from antiquity here, as well as the best dining in Rome. And it's the only place where you will escape the hucksters and gypsies and see Rome as the present-day Romans do. If you're a bit ambitious, take the hike up the Janiculum Hill (where enemy armies would look down on Rome before going to battle, all through the early Republic era), and you will get the best views of the city, with the Vatican, Pantheon, and even Forum in clear view. It's also the freshest air and quietest location you'll find in your entire Roman experience."

We walk through Tiber river to Trastevere and it was so peaceful and quiet, I recommend a little day trip to Vatikan and around."

It's not touristy, even though there are restaurants that cater to tourists. We visited Palazzo Corsini here, where we enjoyed the wonderful art it contains. There are little pizza by the slice and gelato places around it so that you can keep your strength up for all the walking that's involved.Don't miss Santa Maria di Trastevere, the first church to be dedicated solely to the Madonna. Like all churches in Rome, it's incredibly beautiful.Don't miss"

Trastavere is separated from the rest of Rome by the Tiber and as is the case in many other such separations, one gets the feeling that the separation is cultural as well as physical. The restaurants appear to have a very high standard of food but some of them appear to be just traps for the turisti.Both Chiese S. Crisogono and S Maria are worthy of visits but the high point of my last visit was Museo di Roma in Trastavere with two exceptionally good exhibitions, one of photographs and one of acquarelle but unfortunately these are not permanent exhibitions. However, if you are visiting soon, do go and if you are visiting later, look out for the listings; the standard was exceptionally high"

I'd visited Trastevere before but living here now it's even better! While some of the cities most beautiful sites are here (including Gianicolo Hill where you'll get a breathtaking view of the city, Santa Maria in Trastevere basilica) what you really need to do if you're travelling to the area is just throw away the map & get lost in the amazing little & winding cobblestone streets.. One of the oldest quarters of Rome, Trastevere is picturesque with its terracotta wash buildings & washing hanging out of apartment windows - It's like a little village in a big city! I've been documenting my life & times in the area at: www.trasteverecalling2011.wordpress.com Take my advice - a visit to Rome is incomplete without a stop in Trastevere!!"

We went at night and there was a lot going on, it reminded me of a combination of the meat-packing district in New York city with a taste of old San Juan Puerto Rico. I loved the energy in this town and had a great time. I also went to the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to in my life called Rivadestra, which was amazing.

As both Rome\u2019s most ancient and hippest neighbourhood, Trastevere strikes a charming balance between the old and the new. Translating directly to \u201cacross the Tiber,\u201d Travestere is located south of the Vatican on the West side of the river tucked away in its own little oasis, yet walkable from the city center. Long-time locals consider themselves the last remaining true Romans, and as a result, the quarter remains what could be considered Rome\u2019s most aesthetically authentic area. Without a sleek refurbished facade in sight, the architecturally traditional neighbourhood with original narrow cobblestone streets and slender terracotta buildings is an unexpected yet pleasant contrast to the cool, vibrant culture, lively nightlife and trendy one-of-a-kind shops. Piazza Santa Maria has always been, and still remains to be the heart of Trastevere. Speculated to have been the first Christian place of worship in Rome, founded by Callixtus I in the 3rd century, Santa Maria brought people together through religion. Today, the Piazza is bustling with street performers, tourists, and local eateries during the day, and at night Santa Maria transforms into a student hotspot with stylish bar-goers, inexpensive drinks, and wonderful music. A must-see for all tourists! Turn onto any street in the area and you will see a number of traditional Roman restaurants with beautiful patios packed with both locals and tourists alike. Both trend-setters and bargain-hunters might enjoy Rome\u2019s biggest flea market at Porta Portese on Sundays, while Piazza San Cosimato is home to a small daily market where many locals enjoy shopping fresh farmed goods."

First of all, great churches to see like St.Maria in Trastevere, St.Maria di Scala etc. Great Botanical garden, like big park, it was so good to be there 'cos temperatures were high for this time of year. Near by is Villa Farnesina with amazing fresco paintings by Raffaello.Many small streets with little restaurants and art galleries in which you can by some original pieces of jewelry, clothes and Murano glass items. Whole area is little bit quieter than rest of the Rome. Prices are same like in the rest of town, don't expect anything to be cheaper than in centre.Only minus are people, actually some of them.When you cross the Garibaldi bridge with street car no.8, there is square with Casa di Dante and big brown like tower. Behind is small street and on the corner is sort of bakery and pastry shop, Italians call it \"farina\", I believe. Well, on my first visit to this bakery, stuff was a little unpleasant and other time I went there, some other customers Italians, also. \"The big thing\" for their rude behavior was : I saw 3 ladies working there and 3 scales and 3 different types of food. I stand in front of one with pastry and Italian guy with dark glasses was talking all the time since my entry, but after a while, I noticed that he was probably talking to me but wasn't sure because I could not see his eyes and where he was looking. Of course , he was talking on Italian and because of my hair and eyes color , it was so obvious that I'm stranger and one simple gesture with hand will show me that no matter what kind of food I want and no matter 3 \"ladies\" working in 4 m long counter, we all have to be in one line and wait for one of them to come to us and serve! Sorry, where I come from it's just different and when we see tourist in situation like this, we are not expecting to behave like us, domestic folks, in every and each situation in town where he/she will spend just few days.So, great part of Rome to see and some not so great Italians to avoid in Trastevere!"

As we got closer to the university, the area became prettier and prettier until finally my mom and I realized that it would be great to live here! After we met up at the university, we went to lunch at Ristorante Mareusa. Best - meal - ever! If you're not too stuffed or drunk, you must check out Chiesa di San Pietro in Montorio for a great panorama of the city. Then head to Fontana del Gianicolo just a minute walk away. There is bargain shopping galore on Viale di Trastevere as well. Basically, this area is littered, there's graffti everywhere and some parts are just shady. But, take a turn down a narrow street off the busy main roads and treat yourself to a much quieter part of Rome."

Trastevere is the place where you can still observe the daily life of the inhabitants of Rome. In the past it was mainly inhospitable place inhabited by foreigners who threw garbage and poured dirt straight into the narrow cobbled streets. Also there were slaughterhouses and tanneries. However, nowadays it is well preserved and the oldest district of Rome, with its lovely, overgrown with ivy and jasmine, houses and restaurants. We could see few tourists there and locals who went for a walk and spend a nice lazy Saturday afternoon. It is this time of a day when, in our opinion, is the best time to visit the area (although the guidebooks recommend the evening). We were very pleased with the play of lights at this time on a beautiful sunny day. We paid our attention to two particular churches. Church of the twelfth century with a beautiful golden mosaic. This is the oldest church dedicated to St. Maria and it is located in the heart of Trastevere at Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere. And the second one was the Latin American church, where we could see the black dolls of Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary in various forms which represent many countries in Latin America."

If you are looking for a quiet zone in a city as large as Rome you are probably being unrealistic, and Trastevere's charm is based, in large measure, on the fact that it still is home to many Roman citizens, who live there amongst the tourists. Our visit in October/early November came at a time when the tourist hordes were already diminishing but it could still be quite loud well into the early hours of the morning, especially on weekends. Be careful to pick an apartment or hotel room that is not located on one of the busier streets (and is preferably several stories off the ground level) if you prefer a quieter venue. That said we lived in the area for nearly 4 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed it...you can find some very good and not particularly expensive osterias, there is a buzz of street life to the neighbourhood that is ever-invigorating, and, if you pay careful attention you begin to recognize the locals, their habits and their peculiarities, which gives you a nice feel for the geographic personality of this area. Easy walking distance to the Vatican State and to the historic core of ancient Rome. We'd stay there again."

During our visit to Rome we were taken by our local friends to dinner at the Dar Sor Olimpio located in a small piazza in the Trastevere area near the Tiber. I so enjoyed the food there that I am inspired to write a brief revew so that other visitors to Rome who appreciate the pleasures of a delicous cuisine wlll also discover this place of gastronomical delights. I for one, hope for a repeat experience in the not too distant future.We arrived through small cobble-stone paved streets at the restaurant, which seats around 40. Situated among charming ancient buildings the unpretentious decor had a warm and authentic feel. The staff were busy but gracious and at our request recommended for us a series of dishes, which they served singly in the fashion of Chinese banquets. I can say without hesitation that the chef has excellent taste buds and an exceptional talent with food. I would like to do a rave about all the dishes, but suffice to say that the first course of baby squids fried in the lightest and crispiest of batter was the best and most fragrant I have ever had, and I am not even ashamed to admit I took the largest portion of this in our table of four. But I should also mention the other equally mouth-watering dishes: tender octopus salad with small cubes of potatoes and cherry tomatoes coated in a rucola (in Australia we call it rocket) sauce; fresh prawns served on a bed of rucola with three sauces; scampi cooked just right and served with a cream risotto sprinkled with tartufi (truffles). We had to call a halt after our fourth cleaned-out dish when we had all gone passed elegant sufficiency.But we could not leave such a satisfying meal without indulging in some dessert. The Creme Brulet was the best - with a genuine eggy taste under a thin crust of caramel, while the Tiramisu was so good that my husband, who normally does not like creamy sweets after a meal, asked for his own portion after sampling a teaspoonful from his neighbour.After such alimentary delights we sent our compliments heartily to the chef, Mr Robert Giulietti, who honored us by coming out to our table. His appearance did not disappoint either, for he looked quite the authentic Italian chef. What an end to a delightful evening of absolutely delicious dining to discover that Mr Giulietti was actually born in Australia of Italian heritage! Italy's gain is our loss, but we will be back!"

I stumbled upon Dar Sor Olimpio al Drago whilst wandering around the trastevere district over the river and was immediately impressed by the menus on offer; a meat, a fish and a vegetarian menu with 5 starters, 5 mains and 1 dessert on each, at \u20ac18 for a 3 course sit down meal with a glass of wine, some sparkling water and fresh crusty bread it had the value for money box ticked. The location and ambiance were perfect and soon i was sat down, wine in hand, ready to eat.i had some home made pasta with pecorino and cracked black pepper to start with, a dish kept simple so as not to overpower the taste of the fresh pasta and knew immediately i was in safe hands. the braised oxtail came next, braised to minute perfection ( \"eat it with your hands!\" the chef shouted out to me from the kitchen, to my delight) finishing with the very best tiramisu i have ever tasted. a few glasses of red wine later i knew i had to get out walking around rome so as to work up an appetite for the fish menu i was going to have in the evening.That evening i made my way back to the beautiful little Piazza del Drago, all light up and bustling with locals ( a good sign when looking for a decent meal) and got a table at Dar Sor Olimpio again, Angela greeting me with a big smile making me feel very much like a regular on my second visit.\"Pesce?\" she asked\" si signora, grazie.\"From the fish menu i started with grilled scampi risotto, the scampi so fresh they were sweet, followed by swordfish steak sicilian style with olives capers and cherry tomatoes and then instead of the lemon sorbet on the menu the chef gave me another go at his delicious tiramisu, reading my mind, even though his restaurant was packed to capacity and he was by himself in the kitchen. Later Angela came out with a glass of limoncello on the house, suggesting i would need the digestive to help my poor stomach otherwise i might explode.If you are in Rome walk away from the touristy areas where the food is sub par and cross the river and eat with the locals at the Dar Sor Olimpio al Drago, I did.

You can buy a bus pass for a reasonable price from the money you have saved on accomodation.Trastevere is probably best in the evening, along the banks of the river there are stalls selling snacks, drinks and other goods. In the side streets there are many small restauants and often street entertainment in some of the piazzas.
