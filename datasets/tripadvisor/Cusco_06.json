            "review": "Difficult but worth the effort. I went at the start of the rainy season so two out of the four days on the Inca Trail were wet/very wet with thunderstorms and hailstones on occasion. I would recommend taking a good raincoat, waterproof trousers, rucksack rain cover as well as a breathable poncho to cover the lot as a result! I would also recommend going with a good travel company. I went Exodus and had both an excellent tour leader, Julio, and tour guide, Ketty. The porters, waiters and chefs were also great and made the weather and terrain much easier to handle.Day 2 is definitely the hardest day, with lots of climbing until the top of Dead Woman's Pass. However, it is still manageable at a slow and steady pace and walking poles (with rubber tips) helped a lot of people on my group. Altitude is an issue, as the pass is at 4200m, so members of our group were taking either coca tea or Diamox. They seemed to do the trick as we all made it!It is completely worth the effort, however, as there are beautiful Incan sites along the way, the views of the Highlands and Cloud Forest are stunning, and the flora and fauna so unusual to a Brit (llamas, condors, orchids, etc).Climbing the 'Oh My God' steps up to the Sun Gate and seeing Machu Picchu for the first time left us (literally) breathless with awe.This is undoubtedly the best way to approach Machu Picchu and if you're an experienced walker, you should definitely take the Inca Trail!"

SAS was the top company here, so I booked and did the 5 day 4 night (extra night in aqua calentes so I could hike huayna picchu mountain after the last day on the inca trail). The hike guide, porters, and cooks etc were phenomenal. I feel bad writing this critique because they were so very very good. However, the company office administrative staff and the website and communications not good at all Asking a simple question online gets a 5 page standard email back which takes hours to decipher to find the answer to a simple question. The payment system online is confusing and complex. The overall experience of hiking the trail is excellent. The hostel and food in aqua calentes (SAS arranged) is terrible and about half our our group got food poisoning following our final meal there. I had requested the upgraded hotel in 2 emails but the office claimed I did not and because I did not pay for the upgrade they felt quite justified to not upgrade me. That resulted in my partner becoming sick for the remainder 7 days of our vacation (I could not eat the food as it was luke warm and smelt off to me). The other part of this tour that was not fun was the buss back from ollantaytambo - the tour ends the train ride there and you have to take a 2 hour mini bus ride back to Cusco...this is white knuckle and scary. The bus to the trail was an SAS driver and was quite safe but taking the regular minibus back was really bad. The hike and food/drink an staff hiking with you are amazing and thankfully that is the majority of the experience. So yes ...go with SAS but let them know about how to improve the communications and office responses. Don't stay the aqua clients hostel and try to get a decent ride back from olllantaytambo."

My five friends and I embarked on a journey with our jolly tour guide Albert, our eleven amazing porters and one incredibly creative chef named Sebastian.It was 4 days and 3 nights of amazing vistas and breathtaking nature. It was challenging at times with day 2 full of hail and rain and difficult terrain but with Albert cracking jokes, Sebastian whipping up delightful cuisine and the neverending tap of encouragement from our muy fuerte (super strong) porters, we made it through with big grins on our faces.It was also delightful to see that llamapath really cared about their porters and made sure that they had excellent equipment, working conditions and even organised accomodation, holidays and education for them.Our whole group would highly recommend llamapath and in particular Albert and Sebastian's group for the Inca trail! Muchos gracias llamapath."

Downhill is also tricky, down steep, uneven steps! Camping is basic, with squalid toilet facilities. It is time the Peruvian government did something about these conditions, as much for the porters and guides as the tourists. But, despite the drawbacks, it is an incredible experience, one of the best of my life. You don't have to be young I am 65, but you do have to be determined and have a good guide and a supportive group!"

Our tour guide was very kind and very knowledgeable of Inca history. We could not believe how hard the porters worked. Wow! I would tell you to look st your physical self. Do you have good stamina and strength? If so go for it. You need to book 6 months in advance. I am NOT going back as my feet would divorce me :("

Issac was our head guide and he was very informative and passionate about his country and culture. Then we had the ever present and hilarious Nilton as our second in command guide he was the workhorse of the two. Thanks Nilton for all your help in carrying Joe and Doug's back pack all day long as they were ill on the trail. Then there was the food...incredible and delicious. It amazed me the food that the chef Mario put out for us every day. Feeding 15 people 3 meals a day. Also his Sous chef Valantino was our server and he always had a smile on his face and jumped overtime Issac would ask for something. Last but not least were the sherpas that carried all of our extras, including sleeping mats and bags. We were a group of 15 trekkers and we had 2 guides and 23 sherpas in total. They are the real workhorses of the Catchewan people. Just want to thank Alpaca for a very memorable experience and I would recommend you GREEN MACHINES to anyone interested in hiking the Inca trail!"

            "review": "Need to be fit and experienced at hiking. Walking stick is useful here..... We did not walk the whole trail, but did see much of it, and talked with many who walked the whole way. Takes 3-4 days depending on how fast you want to go. There are Peruvian's that have done it in 3-5 hours, but they were young and very very fit and experienced in those high altitudes.It does make a difference, the altitude. They say it's totally random as to who will get sick and who will not. But someone will for sure. The Coca Tea does help as does the Muna Tea. Especially in September and October, there are these Miggies, or the Asians call them Ticks, but they bit and are blood sucking, you need deet or Off or Out absolutely! The walking sticks were everywhere all ages took the climb. You come out, in the end at the Sun Gate, the most amazing sight ever which looks directly down onto Machu Picchu and the wonders of all of that. So once you have seen that, you have arrived.After the experiencing of Machu Picchu, you \"can\" walk down to Aguas Calientes village, takes about 45 minutes. Then you walk along the river until you arrive at the village. There are accommodations there but you really should book ahead. This is a very busy place! You can take the buses down the hill for about 12 solas, but depending on the time of day, that que can be from 15 minutes to 2 hours long just to get a ride down. So walking is an option and only 45-1 hour into the village."

            "review": "Worth the Effort!. My family and I planned this trip four months in advance so we were very well prepared. My mom and dad (53 and 54) trained really hard for this and had no problem at all. The first day was really tough for me because I didn\u2019t sleep well the night before and the weather was awfully hot. The second day is hard because you go up for two hours and then down other two. After lunch is down again and my feet and knees kind of resent it, but in the end we all felt very proud. The views are breathtaking, and that feeling of been surrounded by the mountains and nature is awesome. I would definitely do it all over again, and if you\u2019re thinking in taking the train instead please think it again. It\u2019s a one in a lifetime experience and I promise you won\u2019t regret it. Some tips:Take some Advil with you and take it every six hours during all your stay in Cusco and the Inca Trail. It helps a lot with the altitude issues.Make sure you use good hiking boots and buy a lot of moleskin. You will need it!"

Then slowly it begins to ascend, the views are incredible, featuring glacier and snow covered peaks. Over endless stone steps and switchbacks, the trail snakes upward, above the treeline. Echos haunt the night. Then over the pass, and down to lush trees, one can see the trail winding to the next pass in the distance. Lakes, caves, endless steps, and over the next pass to relentless jungle. The last bit is downhill, past the hydro plant on the river arriving at one last small climb. The reward is the sungate to Machu Pichu. Don't forget to stamp your passport."

There are a variety of trail lengths and checkpoints but I took the popular 4D/3N trek with Alpaca Expeditions and I was blown away. The Machu Picchu experience can be hindered by the overwhelming amount of tourists on cellphones. However, the Inca Trail takes you to many stunning Inca ruins that you get to explore with little to no other tourists, depending on your group size. With Alpaca Expeditions, we had a wonderful guide named Miguel who answered any question we had about the flora, fauna, and history of the trail. The food and amenities they provided for camping were also excellent. I do not enjoy camping but I loved this trek. The mountains, the views of rainbows, sunsets, stars, and wildlife were unlike anything I've ever seen. It is very physical but worth feeling a little sore at the end of the day. This isn't just a hike, it is a lot of climbing stairs laid by the Inca. There is plenty of information online to research before booking this trip but I highly recommend it!"

It's like walking inside a postcard the entire time. However, the Incas were obviously super human because they loved steep ups and downs. Thus, the hike is hard on the knees and you need to be in great shape. We struggled a little with the altitude and physical exertion but we made it and it was an amazing experience.

My wife and I are in our early 50's and while I wouldn't say we are avid hikers, I guess I would say we enjoy short hikes maybe 2-3 times a month at home. So we did lots of research about this hike and of course with the altitude and our backpacks to add some extra weight we were a little apprehensive about doing this hike. But in the end it was a very enjoyable day! Was it tough? I would say yes. Was it ridiculously tough? No. It starts off with getting off the train and a short walk to the entry point where everyone uses the washroom, gets prepared etc. Then its off you go. The first 3 hours basically alternated between a steady incline (nothing to crazy, just a good slope) and then some rocks which made a natural staircase. Maybe 20-25 steps up.....then back to the steady incline. Back and forth it went. Tiring? yes....but doable. And of course your guide should judge how quickly you can go, and you can always rest when you need to. After doing this for about 3 hours you get to Winawayna, which was beautiful. But lots of stairs to climb as you approach it from the base, and work your way to the top where the trail eventually continues. This was almost the most tiring part, climbing those steps! From there we made a short walk to the rest area where we had lunch. Again for us this was hard, we made the 3 hour (or so) hike, but then stopped for an hour to eat and after eating we are not used to doing more hiking but onwards we went! After leaving the lunch spot, this last part is actually very nice and the easiest part of the hike, and I would say the most enjoyable. You hike for about an hour going either flat or slightly downhill. I knew we had to go back uphill at some point and after the hour of nice and easy, we started to climb again. Im not sure exactly how long we climbed for, not long maybe 15 minutes and I heard another guide tell his group we were only 10 minutes away from the sungate. I thought 10 minutes?? thats it? Easy.....and so knowing that, it was pretty easy to press on for another 10-15 minutes and sure enough some final stairs and we arrived at the sungate. Magnificent. So glad we did the hike. One word of caution, we were VERY lucky that it was an overcast day. When the sun did peak through the clouds for a few minutes the sun was scorching. Both my wife and commented how thankful we were we didn't have to hike in that sun for the 3 hours."

The guides Jimmy and Max speak English very well, know a lot about the Inca's and have a great sense of humor!

The guides were friendly, knowledgable, enthusiastic and very good at accessing the capabilities of the group. You could see the company really cared about their porters and they were well looked after. The food was fantastic and we were fed 3 course meals daily. The chef somehow even managed to bake a cake.

They encouraged, they mended and they supported all of the way. They were loose with the truth when it came to time, distance and degree of difficulty. Their knowledge of the history and the area was first-class.The food, lodging and porters were unbelievable. What the porters can do puts us all to shame - very energetic, friendly and hard-working.The scenery changes quite a bit considering that you are only progressing at walking pace. The path varies from as narrow as approx. 75cms and with sheer drops at times. The path can be difficult with round stones and large steps that test out the best of knees. Come prepared to trek - proper boots are a must.We did this as a group of 13 and as a result ended up very close as we shared the joy, the pain and the achievement. This is a bucket list moment and nothing can prepare you for the beauty of seeing Machu Picchu with the first rays of light passing across. Spiritual."

You also need to be prepared to forego a number of basic creature comforts. But if you choose a good company the guides, chef and porters will amaze you with their ability to make life enjoyable throughout the trek. You'll also make some great friends along the way. And arriving at the Sun gate above Machu Picchu at dawn on a clear day gives you a magical experience."

The trek is tough going, relentless uphill to Dead Woman's Pass, and hours of downhill on Day 3 is hard work on your knees, but every second is worth it! The chefs cooked us 3 course meals every day and even baked us a cake. The porters go above and beyond, carrying everything, setting up food tents with tables & stools, putting up our sleeping tents, blowing up our air mattresses for us - they were fantastic. The guides were helpful with the trek and full of knowledge answering our endless questions about the Inca ruins and Machu Picchu. Would 100% recommended the trek to anyone, and would definitely recommend doing it through G Adventures."

            "review": "Bucket List Must. My husband and I did the 4 day/3 night trek from km 82 to Machu Picchu. Our licensed tour operator was Peru Treks (based in Cusco). We cannot express enough how incredible the entire experience was! Definitely book 6-9 months in advance and triple check what items to bring (or NOT bring). It was brutal at times, especially on the 2nd day, and especially for those, myself included, who experienced altitude sickness, as the ascent to Dead Woman's Pass reaches 4200m. Along the way you are able to go at your own pace, taking in the splendor or the Andes. Simply breathtaking. There are ruins along the trail, of course, of former cities and our guides were extremely knowledgeable about the cultural and archaeological history of the area. Our tour operator cooked our meals and carried tents and other supplies; each person carries their own pack of water, clothes, jacket, sleeping bag, etc. You get a true appreciation for the land and culture doing the trek, something that would not have been attainable if you simply take the bus to Machu Picchu. The memories and photos and feeling of accomplishment are irreplaceable. If you are physically able, you MUST do the trail to get a full understanding of Machu Picchu and the Cusco region. Incredible experience, and I wouldn't change anything about it. Except maybe better public restrooms..they had squat toilets that left you wondering, \"Is that mud or...?\" As disconcerting as it is, just a fair warning to all the future travelers...but we all survived. Also, we weren't in the best of shape beforehand (I'd say moderately fit), so I'd advise cardio to strengthen quads and calves. You will be doing literally thousands of steps, up and down. Trekking poles are also a good idea, too. If you are on the fence about the trail, don't be. You can do it!!!"

Do not under-estimate this trek, it is difficult with steep ups and downs and very little level ground. You do need a decent level of fitness but you don't need to be superhuman! The views are stunning and photos do not do it justice. We did the trail with Inca Trail Reservations who I highly recommend. The porters are amazing and do a brilliant job. The camping and facilities are basic so be prepared for that. I recommend taking TravelJohns for the night-time! I wouldn't do it again, but am so glad I have taken the opportunity to do it once. We had a great group as well which made a difference as we were all very supportive of each other. One of our group turned their ankle on the second day and had to be carried (yes, carried!) by porters to Aguas Calientes. Now they ARE superhuman!"

So my son and I did the 5day/4night hike of the Inca trail and had a wonderful time.Barely any bugs(which was surprising to me)outside of some very small mosquitoes and the views were awesome. We enjoyed the extra time(no rushing) and were blessed with great weather(rained a couple nights but was just foggy in the morning). There was a valley we climbed up after the highest point on the trail, where frogs were singing a wonderful melody just for us! Great time with my son in a faraway land!"

Try and avoid rushing things, dont do what we did. We were very lucky to get our spaces only 30 left and almost sold out, Chris who booked our trek for us made sure we purchased the spaces first thing on Monday morning. Some essential items to bring, a camera, sunscreen, a hat, mosquito repellent, and at least 100 soles to tip the guide and porters."

Baldy, or in random hiking trails. This is the real deal! My best friend and i both have military and academy experience and training. The terain is rugged, rough, and the levels of difficulty of the climbing in some of the more rural mountain passes were very narrow and the altitude, weather, and your own physical conditioning is crucial. We both ran, hiked, gave up drinking, and maintained a strict diet 3 months prior to be prepared. This experience was the most difficult in terms of challenging your mind and body. The best feeling in the world was once we finally reached machu picchu!Its a badge of honor and a deep respect for the Inca's and for all of the achievements they as a civilization were able to obtain and mai tain for over 500 years. The scenery was amazing..we zip linned, water rafted, cycled, hiked, and ate everything in site. I strongly recommend you do your home work before venturing out into the jungles."

The history, the walk, the ruins, and the spectacular scenery will be hard to beat anywhere. Everyone talks about Machu Picchu, but it is the 'getting there' that is the real experience. The ecosystems are so varied and the mountains awe-inspiring. We went on this trail with Quecua Treks Peru, a highly professional group reviewed elsewhere (an outstanding tour company). We were lucky enough to have Marcelo Batata as our guide. Marcelo is a talented teacher, and brought the Incas to life. Funnily enough we usually don't like having guides telling us about what we are seeing, but Marcelo is an exception. Unlike many guides, he knows about his topic, and has a skill in communicating it in a highly engaging fashion. There was never a moment when he explained too much. Walking this trail was an amazing experience, and Marcelo made it even better. Apart from his knowledge and experience in story-telling, Marcelo is also very charming and engaging. If you have an opportunity to choose your guide, choose Marcelo."

Hire porters to carry your gear, some professional trekking poles, and make sure you have warm sleeping bags and a sleeping mat (if you want to get some sleep during the cold nights). The second day is the most difficult by far. It took us about 4 hours to climb up Dead Woman's Pass, and 2 more hours to go down to the next campsite. We didn't train at all before the trek- so some walking/hiking will make it even easier. Overall- it's a great experience that all trekkers should aim to do once in their lives."

Now if you go to Peru then you can't leave without going to Machu Picchu and the best way to do this is via the Inka Trail. You can either do a 5-day trek or one that sees you departing the train at 104km and then undertaking a 10.5km trek up, up and up again! If this isn't for you then you can simply jump on the bus from the town. You will need to pre-organise permits as the site only allows 2,500 visitors per day.As a family of 4 (inc. 2 boys aged 14 and 16) we decided to do the trek from 104km.Now we're relatively fit but this is very hard work with altitude having an impact on your capabilities so take your time, go at your own pace and listen to your guide. Also ensure you have plenty of water with you.The first 4.5km took us 4hrs and it seemed at times all we were doing was climbing, stopping to regain our breath and then climb again. We then had a break for lunch and the last 6km took 2hrs as the ground largely flattened out with only minor climbs.The scenery en-route is simply amazing as are the Winay Wayna ruins and when you reach Intipunku (Gate of the Sun) you'll be knocked off your feet as you oversee Machu Picchu.it was an incredible experience and one that will eternally stay with us. When we eventually reached our hotel and took our shoes off that was equally satisfying!!A must do!"

You really need to allow yourself three days in Cusco before taking off on the trail. For us, we found that you had to book your permits about three - four months out. We tried to do this hike in June 2014 and when we went to look at the tickets about two months out, they were all gone for the season. We went in September and the temperatures were perfect for the hike. A few tips, and if you go with a hiking group (we used Llama Path) most of this can be rented: definitely get the walking sticks, you'll use them to stabilize on the treks going downhill way more than you realize, do NOT bring more weight then you need to, it adds up and you'll be too tired at night to read on your ipad, and the key to surviving... layers. Wear things that you can remove easily or add on easily because the hikes up and down will get you way warmer than you realize, but stopping and for photos, breaks, or food will get cold again pretty quickly. I'd highly recommend using Llama Path as a tour group. Excellent guides, great support structure in terms of porters and cooks."

            "review": "It's as much about the journey (hiking the Inca trail) as it was the destination (Machu Pichu). My wife, ten year old son and me (66 years) finished hiking the Inca Trail (4 days and 3 nights) with Peru Trek on August 12, 2016. While visiting one of the wonders of the world, Machu Pichu, was the overall purpose of our trip, it was the journey as much as the destination that will stick with us for a lifetime. There are a number of adventure companies in Peru that do the Inca Trail, but for our money Peru Trek was the BEST. With their awesome guides (ours: Freddie and Pepe) and 18 Cheskies (more than mere porters), we were supported on one of the toughest treks imaginable, with summits of 14,000 feet and average elevations of 10,000 - 12,000 feet; it was either up or down, and very little in between. We had 3 excellent meals a day, camp (tents) was set up a waiting for us at the end of the day and broken in the morning. We were a group of 12, a family of 5, and two couples, who will remain our friends for the life. Maximum group size is 16. Peru Treks, from the initial contact to the final tour of Machu Pichu and return to Cuzco, was professional, informative, supportive and well-organized. This was an experience (vacation doesn't exactly represent what this trip was all about) of a lifetime; my son will certainly never forget it.We also did day trips around Cuzco, the jumping off point for the Inca Trail (at least two days required acclimatization (12,000 feet) and the capital of the Inca Empire. More on these trips and our trip to the Peruvian Amazon in future posts.Glad to answer any questions out there(The same review was posted for Peru Trek)"

It was mind-boggling that such impressive sites are only accessed from the trail. It was long and hard but the rewards were great. We did the 5 day trail which I would recommend over the more common 4 day as you have a little more time to enjoy the scenery and you get to visit Machu Picchu refreshed the next day."

Our family of 4 were fortunate to traverse the most magnificent countryside with breathtaking views for 4 days of trekking, together with family friends as part of a private 4d/3n trek. Although we are a relatively fit family and had done some stair training prior to departure, we did find the route a little tougher than expected. The relentless uphills and uneven walking terrain coupled with high altitude took their toll on our breathing patterns but thanks to our superb guide Jose, who kept our pace slow and steady to acclimatize as we headed along the way, we all coped. We had not been aware that there were different timings and camps depending on the tour company you select and it is well worth studying the itinerary of various companies prior to making a decision . We were so grateful to have gone with Llama Path as it meant we did not overdo it on any day and always made it to camp before nightfall. Some of the other groups entered the camp after dark with headlights on as they tend to shorten the first days trek but then have a grueling third day, which is particularly tough given the 3 am start on day 4 for all to make it to Sun Gate by sunrise. The second day crossing two mountain passes with steep descents and cold rainy weather was the toughest day for us all but the incredible scenery made it worth it. We were surprised by the number of Inca Sites we visited along the way and particularly enjoyed Winay Wanay, perched high on the hilltop it is breathtaking beautiful and so quiet and quite different from the incredibly busy Machu Picchu ruins. We enjoyed it more than MP and loved spending time with the many Llama's that graced the various terraces. We highly recommend our tour operators Llama Path, who not only looked like the most professional outfit, who ensured all their amazing chaskis had suitable hiking boots and warm clothing but always managed a smile or a friendly wave as they toiled their way up the hills with our heavy load. The food was delicious and there was so much of it at each meal time. The thoughtful chef Melchor, managed to provide me with a gluten free menu each day including specially made gluten free snack options for my daypack! We also booked to climb the Wayna Picchu mountain, overlooking the magnificent MP Inca ruins and although this was pretty tough going with weary legs after 4 days of walking it was so worth it! We are so pleased to have completed this bucket list item and the memories will remain forever. We cannot recommend a visit to Peru and doing the Inca Trail highly enough!"

We went with Llama Path, who was the best tour company we could have asked for. Two things: 1) altitude sickness is a real thing and 2) Ibuprofen is a LIFE SAVER. The altitude sickness medications can cause very weird and uncomfortable side effects and Ibuprofen is a fantastic alternative that saved me on the ascent to Dead Woman's Pass. Outside of that, there aren't enough good things to say about this trail. You will feel simultaneously accomplished and dwarfed when standing on top of the massive mountain you just conquered, struggling to comprehend how you're still surrounded by even higher peaks. Definitely a trip for anyone who needs an \"I can do anything!\" pick me up."

A few things to keep in mind:- hike is not easy - would not recommend to someone not in halfway decent shape. Difficult on knees due to long periods of climbing down inca stairs, sometimes for hours at a time. - pack light - less you have to carry the better- wear right clothes - lightweight hiking clothes, with removable pants, easy to roll-up, are really worthwhile- wide range of temperatures - so clothes should match both high 60s and low 30s- be prepared for some pretty bad outhouses"

After trying to sift through reviews on the Inca Trail we were concerned about our ability to do the trek, but we thought \"let's go for it!\" Both in our later 50's, little trekking experience, and with a teenage son we booked with KB Adventures. We did some solid hill training and lost a bit of excess weight to get ready. This paid off big time. KB Adventures were on the cheaper side with costs, and you carried your own gear, but certainly did not disappoint us. They were great, the guide, the cook and the friendly porters, and the food was plentiful and first class!! We were anxious at the start, but that subsided quickly as we got going. Day 1 started with the normal pickups and stops and starts before arriving at the start point. After waiting around for our turn to start we traveled 9kms on the first day. We had spent some time in Bolivia before Cusco so we had got a bit used to the altitude and only suffered from a lack of oxygen in the air. You just breathed a bit harder and had to take regular short stops to get your breath, no real problem. Day 2 and we were off by 6am after a great breakfast. 13kms and up to 4215m in altitude sounded tough, but with regular breaks and sensible speeds we had no real problems. A bit breathless at times, but reaching Dead womens pass was just magic. Day 3 was the most scenic and interesting. 16kms and some amazing ruins, but not too difficult. Day 4 was a very early start at 3am and after a wait until 5.30am at the control gate we were let loose to make the sungate by dawn. Even though we were 2 of the oldest trekkers on the day we reached the sungate well before anybody else and waited to enjoy Machu Picchu be unveiled at first light. We were not exhausted, or tired or sore, but exhilarated by the sight in front of us. So, my whole point of this post is that if you are debating about doing the trek as an over 50 then go for it. Do some training and lose a bit of weight if you need too, but it's still possible. We have no regrets, and are now looking at other trekking adventures. NB The walk down from Machu Picchu is pretty awful, dry and dusty. The bus is now $12US which is ridiculous for 4kms."

We just got back from our wonderful trip in Peru with the help of South Adventure Peru Tours!! Many thanks to Ruben & Tatiana (Managers itself) who organized this wonderful trip and made absolutely certain we were happy and had everything we needed to make this trip a lifetime! This company is not the cheapest but it provides top quality service, we were a family of 8 members with 3 teenagers, everybody in our group was very pleased with this company. We just spent 12 Days of trip around Peru, Ruben & Tatiana worked with us extensively to plan a fantastic family adventure to Tambopata in Puerto Maldonado ( Wasay Lodge ) we did the City tour in Cusco by horseback riding which was really fun but have an experience because if you never done , tell to Ruben to take care about it however, we made it ! we took the tour to the Sacred valley, 2 Day trip to Machu Picchu & Huayna Picchu, we had free time to visit the Inca bridge and sun gate in Machu Picchu so it was really interesting at all, we did the mountain biking in Maras Moray & Salt Mines and then we took a tour to Puno \u2013 TITICACA, Colca Canyon in Chivay and then Arequipa \u2013 Lima. Ruben & Tatiana put whole trip together for us, it was best trip we`ve ever taken. Before our trip to Peru, Ruben was very responsive to all of our pre-trip questions, we felt him warmth and love for his country, and it was a joy to meet him and his family in Cusco upon our arrival. Regarding our trip , we asked for this ambitious schedule because we wanted to experience ALL the areas listed above , and some in our group could only away for this period of time, in retrospect , we wished we could have spent a few extra days in Peru so our group pace would have been a bit more leisurely . However, the top notch guides we had were flexible and responded to our needs for food and rest when needed. Speaking of guides, they couldn`t have been better\u2014they were personable, sensitive and caring. All the plans made with and through Ruben were delivered as promised. We especially appreciate the readily available water provided before every tour, ground transportation in Peru, top notch hotels were clean and comfortable, first rates guides, and entrances to everywhere. Every single guides was passionate and knowledgeable about Peru`s exceptionally rich cultural and history n and dedicated to ensuring that we had a first-rate experience. The food was amazing and very tasty, we couldn't have better food we loved the food specially the guinea pig. Our tour guide Coco were very professional and informative and knowledgeable, was exceptional guide, who was very historical and cultural guide, he went off this way to take care of all our needs. Arnold was a safe driver, we felt very comfortable with him. All the tours was wonderful from start to finish, everyone was SUPER accommodating and informative.  Again , we couldn't have asked for a better guides and quality of service , I would HIGHLY recommend South Adventure Peru Tours and specially Ruben & Tatiana ( Owners ) they made an outstanding job!!!"

Layers are critical too as temps in July went between 22 and -5 C. It actually snowed the day prior to our trek commencing. Level of fitness also really needs to be solid as the altitude and long days would undermine or interrupt the experience. We did see one person early on Day 2 backtracking due to fitness. Day 3 was amazing to see a series of inka ruins without the madhouse that awaits at machu pichu. Again, if you can do Wayna Pichu but do so after a nights rest at aquas calientes. It will cost more but you will be better able to appreciate both it and machu pichu after the hordes leave around 2pm"

It is a 45 kms stretch peaking at 13,776 feet to be hiked in four days. The second day is supposed to be the hardest passing the \u201cDead Woman Pass\u201d mountain. On the fourth day, hikers are to get up at 4 am, hike for two hours to IntiPunku, the Sungate, to watch the sun rise at Machu Picchu. The timing is really up to your guide. We were able to hike this in three days and at the end of the third day, we were on the bottom of Machu Picchu and camped there. On our first day, we hiked three hours longer advancing us to 3.5 kms above where we were to begin on the second day. Our guide arranged for our permit to camp at a different campsite. Second day is supposed to be the hardest but in our case, I believe it was the first day as we barely arrived to our site before sundown. This is a lottery system and permits are sold on the first of February with only 500 hikers, guides and porters are allowed. Get your permit fast. The steps were high, all stones. I can\u2019t help but wonder how the Inkas built high steps when they are short people with short legs. But the greatest entertainment for me is to watch the porters climb up or slide down practically running, with their sandals and 20 kilos of weight on their back. They are super human. On our last night, we had a ceremony to hand the tips to the porters, cooks and guides. If you do this, please be generous with your tips. It was very touching to hear the speech of the head porter (spoken in Quechua and translated in English by our guides) when he said, behind these people who helped you are not just faces but they are raising families. In addition, he said, \u201cOur government is supposed to be helping us. Instead, it\u2019s you, the tourists who help us.\u201d Oh how true. After they finished, they had blisters in their hands. They really spoiled us and made our climb bearable and achievable. It\u2019s another feat, another great memory and another item off my bucket list. Now it\u2019s your turn. Train well and know your limits."

The Inca Trail is beautiful and I can't describe how special it is to stand in places that most travelers don't see because there are no roads. We saw new constellations, made some friends, met physical challenges and shared some beautiful sunrises. We used Enigma Travel and I recommend them highly. I am 56 and my husband is 61 and this hike was very doable for us; there were also 64 year olds in our group. 10% of hikers don't finish the trip, but if you are in decent shape and want a very special trip, this is it. My recommendation: stay overnight in Aguas Calientes and go back up to Machu Picchu the second day because, to tell you the truth, by the time you get there on the first day you are so tired and dirty all you can think about is a shower."

But the energy of the place, the camaraderie of all the visitors throughout the days, the amazing breathtaking views , the story behind the original hikers, the archeological spots, everything was amazing individually and when put together in a trip, it is just magical!. The trail you can do it on your own or with friends, either way, the trip is individual. You ultimately go at your own pace and it is an un-skippable opportunity to be alone with your thoughts and practice being on the moment. The third day was just the best scenery, experience with all the domestic Llamas and the time off we had to just rest and share all the experience we had for the past days. The one thing that you will only \"get\" when you do it is that , Macchu Picchu is the goal. You are walking the Inca trail to get there, right? But the truth is that , even though the place is one of the world wonders and it is in fact an amazing must go to place. The best part of Macchu Picchu is the Inca Trail. After spending 4 days walking, learning how the natives traveled and got there, their story, the scenery, when you get to your destination, it is magical and amazing, but not better than the Inca trail itself. Now the technical stuff : You Have to have your appropriate hiking gear, your day pack its important, water, good snacks, and most of all, if you are not a usual hiker, prepare yourself. You will enjoy it better if you are in good physical conditions. I am not a hiker but Im a runner and a yogi and I didn't feel the hit in my body, but many in the group did. It is not an impossible thing to do if you are not in good physical conditions, but you will definitely enjoy it better if you are prepared. Im gonna leave you with this story:My friend was not in good physical conditions (she didnt prepare) and the first night she was just frustrated and very ready to quit. After we got back to Lima, about 2 nights after we finished the Trail, we were having dinner with drinks and I asked her - Now that the difficult days passed and you are now relaxed , what would you recommend if someone asks you how to visit Macchu Picchu? , Would you recommend walking the trail or taking the train? , she said \"No. You have to do the trail\""

Our team of porters were fantastic, as they all are. The quality of food presented was incredible and the way they packed up and ran ahead to be waiting at the next campsite was incredible. An amazing experience, physically challenging and all the more rewarding for being so. The only disappointment was the Machu Picchu tourist experience - immense crowds and long queuing times.Worth noting that tipping is customary and relied upon - no matter if you come from a non tipping nation it is the right thing to do here."

            "review": "\"Classic\" Inca Trail, 4 days / 3 nights. What an amazing experience! Absolutely wonderful.It's a really beautiful high altitude walk with 3 overnight camps. You visit many Inca sites and you pass through cloud forest, high puna, mountains and jungle.If you are considering walking the Inca Trail I'd strongly recommend finding out about it before you go. Make sure you are fit and acclimatised.I am 56, reasonably fit but not an athlete, and I enjoy gentle hiking in Yorkshire. I'd never previously been at such high altitude and I was anxious about whether I'd manage this trek, but in fact I had no problems, and enjoyed every moment from start to finish. Even my creaky old knees survived, with the help of my walking poles. I was very glad to have spent 6 days in and around Cusco before we started the trek. There are loads of interesting things to do, (museums, restaurants, Inca sites, markets, alpaca knitwear to buy ...), and we were able to acclimatise to the high altitude - I'd felt dizzy and very breathless on my first couple of days in Cusco - no way would I have managed the trek at that stage. Many trekkers we met suffered altitude problems, from mild headache and nausea, to severe sickness. In another group, one boy was so sick on the first night that he had to give up (and his dad had to leave with him). What a disappointment. These problems are largely avoidable if you can acclimatise beforehand. It's not possible to walk this trail independently, so you're obliged to depend on porters to carry your tent, food and cooking gear, even if you carry all your personal gear yourself. Typically, porters carry a staggering 25kg each. They pack up camp after the trekkers leave, overtake you en route, and arrive at the next destination in time to set up camp and make dinner before the trekkers arrive. I felt humbled! Try to ensure you use a tour company which takes responsibility for porter welfare. We saw porters carrying more than 25kg, some wearing inadequate clothing, even broken sandals. Toilets on the trail are rather unpleasant. If you can't cope with this, maybe the trail is not for you. A few companies take their own private chemical toilet ... but this means that a porter has to carry the tourists' sewage for 4 days. This seems utterly degrading to me (especially as he wouldn't even be permitted to use the toilet himself!)."

Let me say this out front and centre: this was one of the most memorable and incredible experiences in my lifetime.I did the classic 4-day, 3-night Inca Trail with a friend through Travel Fast Cusco tour operator. I consider myself to be in fairly good shape but this trek really pushed me to my physical and mental limits. The altitude plays a huge factor in reduced stamina and even though we gave ourselves 2-days to acclimatize in Cusco prior to starting the trek, you could still feel it's effects (especially on day 2 if doing the classic trail).You'll most likely be in a fairly large group (I believe max group size can be 16) and you'll all encourage and support one another - we were a group of 8. It's a great bonding experience to say the least and I know in my case at least, you meet some great people! The views during this trek are what really blow you away. Mountains; rivers; the vastness of the sky - it's all incredibly humbling and you really have to stop and appreciate it all time-to-time during the 4 days to fully take advantage of the trek. Definitely should be on everyone's bucket list if you're able to do it!Common Sense/Pro tip: Watch your mochila/backpack at all times. You're sharing the trail with hundreds of others at any time which include guides, porters and other tourists. I left my bag outside one of the washroom doors the final morning while I... attended to some business. During the few minutes I was in there, someone managed to sneak through the top pocket of my bag and take my camera and phone - a $1500 mistake."

Whilst the experience was amazing, I have to say that unless you are in perfect health and reasonably fit you are infinitely better off taking the bus directly to Machu Picchu. The altitude is very difficult so do make sure to get the proper medication to manage this and if hiking, every gram counts - re-wear the same clothes if you can as you don't appreciate how heavy things can get after hours of climbing narrow staircases with everything on your shoulders. Good shoes, thermal compression leggings and a tiny sleeping bag are essential. Our guide says there is one or two in every group that finds the trail very difficult, if not dangerous, so be prepared to unexpectedly be that person even if you feel confident in your ability now. This trail is the only way to view some of the other lost Inca cities that are smaller than Machu Picchu, and the mountains really are spectacular. Invest in a good quality company to take you - do your research beforehand!"

The trail varies in difficulty but is always scenic. Day 2 is difficult, but I found going down much tougher than going up. Hire a local porter (your guides can help with this once on the trail) if you are at all in doubt about your ability/enjoyment after the second half of day 1. Day 3 has another killer downhill--at least for my 61 year old bad knee and artificial hip.

The \"green machine\" carried our tents, sleeping bags, dining tent and chairs, food, propane fuel for cooking, etc. They were always waiting for us with prepared lunch at mid day and again in evening with tents already up and ready for our arrival. The food was perfect: good variety and selected to support our trekking experience. The guides, Russel and Amerigo, were the best ever! Very informative. Patient, but kept us on pace to see sunrise over Machu Picchu on the 4th morning! A great lifetime experience for the 3 generations of family members (ages 13 to 71 years). A real memory making adventure."

We started the 4 day trek after a few days in Cusco to acclimatise to the high altitudeWe walk every weekend but made a point since January to walk higher and further, ie doing Ben Nevis a few weeks ago.Day 1- the day was really hot. We walked 10-11 km... up and down until we reached the campsite at 3100mDay 2- the dreaded walk to Dead Womans Pass.... be prepared for steep walks... you walk high and long, its a 7 km walk but feels longer. You climb to 4200m and once you reach the peak- the emotions will hit you. You then walk a steep drop to the campsite at 3600m. Trust me... it was bloody coldDay 3- is a 12km walk up and down... the knees may hurt but the views of the cloud forest and camping above the clouds was spectacular. The stars were clear and amazing ! The camp site remains at e600m and its coldDay 4- lots of walking of which 4 hours is all down hill to about 900m until you get to the monkey stairs.... by now you wonder if you can make it up the steep almost straight stepsThen the moment you've been waiting for. Walking through the sun gate to the sight if machu pichu in the distance. Yes many if us cried it was so emotionalThe walk to machu pichu from the sun gate is about 40 minutes but the view is worth itIf you do the trek- we went with Exodus.... use porters. They are amazingYou must have a season 4 sleeping bag- our comfort zone was -5 and it was needed2-3 pairs of walking trousers and quick drying tee shirts for each day2 litre bottles for waterHatWaterproof coatGlovesSun creamMosquito spray Its easy to take far too much but its simply not worth itOur guide Cesar was simply the best and got us through the daysThe cooks prepared the most amazing breakfast, lunches and dinners. Goodness knows how but they didThe porters beat us each day and we arrived to our bags and tents already up. The cheered us every day when we 2arrived at camp. Seriously they deserve the clapsIts not easy... you must acclimatise properly before hand... our tour took 5 days by coach to reach cusco and 2 days there to get use to the altitude. Our walking and gym for months before helped us... Didn't ache in the slightest while walking. I have asthma and didn't need my inhalers although you pant while walking esp day 2-3 due to the high altitude but nothing to worry aboutDON'T TAKE TABLETS FOR HIGH ALTITUDE.... the side effects are almost identical as altitude sickness. One of our group was carried of on a stretchered by 2 porters due to the effects of the medication on the morning of day 3...If you can push yourself to do this trek then do it. Don't be a wuss and go by bus from Machu Pichu town... challenge yourself. You won't regret it"

Even if you are unsure if you can handle it, I would still recommend it!! You will surprise yourself, because my own nerves were shot away pretty quickly when I realised that our tour guide was taking it very slow and you could very much walk at your own pace. We had some people in our group with bad knees, backs, and generally low fitness, but no one had to turn back and everyone made it to Machu Picchu. I was traveling with 4 other people and we were in a trekking group of 16 with Peru Treks who I would definitely recommend. Our tour guide and porters definitely made the experience what it was. We hired half porters, which I thought was a good decision because having less weight on my back was great during the harder uphill times. If you go in winter (summer in the Northern hemisphere), beware that it really gets quite cold at night. I had quite miserable sleeps for being too cold! Day time is decently warm though so layers are really the key here.The trail itself is clean and well maintained. There are pretty decent bathrooms (squatting toilets) all along the way as well as people selling bottled water (on day 1 & 3 and half of 2). I would not recommend bringing a filter bottle such as LifeStraw, because there aren't really many places where you would get good use of them. The feeling when you reach Machu Picchu is rewarding, but so are the views you see all throughout the hike and the feelings of accomplishment at the end of every day."

Mountains, vegetation, birdlife and enormous glittering night skies were stunning and I wished the trek had lasted longer. Machu Picchu is crowded, yes, but still fantastic, as are the other smaller ruins on the way. Highly recommended. I went in early May. It rained once, at night. How fit do you have to be? At 58 I was at the older end of the spectrum in my group, and I live at sea level. I prepared carefully, testing my shoes and other equipment in conditions as like as possible to those on the trek. I normally do some kind of exercise for about 45 mins to an hour most days. In the two months previous I upped my normal exercise to include twice weekly four hour hikes with a steep height gain similar to that on day 2 (4,000 feet), wearing the loaded daypack. In Peru, I acclimatized for four days previous to the hike, and I took Diamox, too. No way of knowing if this worked, but although I still felt short of breath at the beginning, I never felt sick, or exhausted, as others in the group did. Its just a matter of going at a workable pace. The long second day was hard, but doable. I think training really pays off, and leaves you free to enjoy this astounding hike."

Roxner and his team exceeded our expectations in every way and we had the most amazing adventure exploring the Inca Trail and all the ruins along the way. We started out at KM82 and trekked up to Ayapata on Day 1, then Dead Woman's Pass with stops at Llulluchapampa, Rancuraccay, Sayamarca, and Chaquicocha on Day 2, then on to Winay Winay on Day 3, followed by a 3am wake up to be at the park gates to hike to the Sun Gate and Machu Picchu on the morning of the 4th day. Lots of beautiful ruins and lots of steps. Roxner was excellent at explaining the history of the Quechua/Inca and made it very interesting. We were very spoiled in that we were able to see many of the ruins along the way with just our private group of 6. When we finally arrived at Machu Picchu, it was spectacular, and the icing on the cake so to speak, but there were so many people that it took away from getting the maximum benefit of being in such a special place. So glad we had the chance to see lots of other ruins as well as learn about the culture, along the way. When traveling to a high altitude place and hiking over 12,000' I highly recommend Diamox, as that helped us with minimizing symptoms. Also recommend staying in Cusco 3 days prior to starting your trek as there is so much to see while getting acclimated."

We spent 5 days around Cusco and the Sacred Valley before the trek to acclimatize to the altitude and fortunately had no issues, can also recommend doing some type of hill and steps training before leaving cause there are plenty on the trek. Having the right gear, eg. boots (goretex), suitable clothes for layering, etc will also ensure you're prepared for the various conditions you can experience on the way, our mornings were cool and afternoons very warm during the walk with some rain in between......you can experience them all in a day.

I didn't do too much training but walk about 7KM per day anyway, I found it doable but bring a light back pack and recommend poles, I wasn't going to get any but they were the best thing to have. Booked via G adventures and booked 6 months in advance, you need to otherwise you won't get on and most people on the trip decided to do it last minute and could not so they were very disappointed, that's my advice, book, you can always cancel closer to the time but can't decide last minute to do it. Best to keep your options open."

The views of the Andes were spectacular, the cobblestone trail, with narrow steep steps a good workout. easily one of the top 5 treks I have taken."

            "review": "The inca trail walk of shame. . I read loads of information on the inca trail before going and one thing that no one mentioned was that not everyone makes it! It had been a dream of mine to do the inca trail for as long as I could remember and I finally managed to get to do it. I think we're were about an hour into the walk when I first saw a couple of people walking towards us, heads down doing the walk of shame back to base. I remember thinking, how can they just give up! The next person was a woman sitting on a horse with an oxygen mask on. There were a few more after that. Maybe 10-15 tourists followed by their porters. It was getting to the end of the first day and we were tiered, the steps were getting steeper. Our guide had decided to camp 1hr into the climb up dead Womans pass because we had made such good progress on the first half of the day. I noticed that after lunch my husband was starting to sweat alot more as we were getting higher. He is an instructor at a gym and alot fitter than I am. He was struggling to breathe. He had a bad headache by now and was feeling light headed. His breathing was fast and shallow and he was started to stumble. He kept blacking out. We tried to carry on and get to camp, but the higher we went the worse he got. Our guide went on ahead to fetch the porters with our tents. I was dark by now. We turned around and slowly stumbled back down the hill where we set up camp to see what he was like the next morning. The next morning he wasn't much better. He still had a really bad headache, felt dizzy and sick. The decision was taken to turn back. There was a small hospital in the village at the base of the hill. Our guide said we should go there. The doctor examined my husband and put him on a drip. He also gave him a couple of injections. Were were there for about 2 hours until he started to feel better. It was now our turn to do the walk of shame back to base. It isn't all bad though. We stayed that night in Ollantaytambo and caught the train the next day to Machu Picchu town where we stayed the night. The next day we were up bright and early to catch the 5.30 bus to Machu Picchu! Our tickets were still valid. It was well worth the vist and we looked alot fresher than those who had walked!"

The third day is the most rewarding because of the many and varied microclimates, the extraordinary variability of the trail, the dips into the mountains and the range of the inca ruins. The last day with the mad 3:30 start and the rush to the sun gate can't spoil it and the hours wandering Machu Picchu a thrilling end. Day 2 and dead woman's pass seems but a trifle of inconvenience hiking to 4215m and then descending again. Just found it. They feed you and fuss over you if you are on a trek, it just can't be imagined! Just do it."

The first day is relatively easy and beautiful but a little off putting due to the animal crap everywhere. And I mean everywhere on the trail. Day 2 is where the real beauty (and difficulty begins) as you climb climb climb up and over Dead Woman's pass. No matter how hard you train or how good of shape you are in the altitude may get you. Take altitude meds, chew coca, drink tons of water, and have oxygen in case you get HAPE symptoms, which is rare but I did... Otherwise, the views will blow your mind. Sublime. Seriously the stuff dreams are made of. Day 3 for us was 11 hours and super long (the nightmare portion for me). A mystical decent in the cloud forrest. This day is down down down so if you have knee problems, poles and knees braces will help save you. Plus copious amounts of ibuprofen. Day 4 is an early one but you should arrive at the Sungate in time to see the shadow of night roll over Machu Picchu, bathing it in light. Overall, the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life."

The sense of accomplishment finishing that pass and heading on is incredible. We had people in our group who'd never hiked a day in their lives to people who'd climbed Kilimanjaro. I do recommend doing some kind of training before the trek. There's no way to train for altitude so being in physical shape helps."

Brilliant trip, via red Spokes Peru trip (mountain biking and Inka trail) but actually handled by Unitours. Picked up at hotel then met guide outside Cusco, Wilfredo was brilliant throughout. There is a lot of admin for the guide and you need to book really early. We were a group of eight and were all very well acclimatised from 2 weeks mountain biking but even for us altitude was noticeable. Day 1 is a half day, not too much height gain, couple of great ruins and good chance to get into how the trip works. Day 2 is one huge climb, lots of steps, and big descent, more steps. Great campsite. We just went for it and enjoyed the physicality and views. Day 3 : We set off real early and had the trail to ourselves, thanks Wilfredo! What an awesome experience, 4 sets of ruins, great views, great history. Day 4 : Beware, we couldn't get access to final climb to sun gate until 5:30 , no chance of sunrise.However 1st view of Machu Pichu was everything we had hoped for. As sun spread over ruins we were spellbound. Food on trek was very good, better than most hotels outside major towns, Porters were ace, and with our limited Spanish and some mime we were able to have some sort dialogue."

We went with Valencia Travel and i 100% recommend them to everyone. Day three, you can go to a waterfall. GO!!!!!! The ruin that;s right before it was my favorite. After the hard day 2, you come to a castle on a cliff about 20 minutes before camp. CLIMB IT! It's worth it. We got there around sunset and it was breathtaking. We had a fantastic experience. If you want to see Macchu PIcchu, you must trek the Inca Trail."

I'm not in shape. I'm not even in \"I can run from zombies for more than two minutes so I don't die\" shape. I'm in \"I like to sit on the couch and eat Doritos a lot\" shape.I did SOME preparation for the trip. I exercised on an elliptical irregularly for 4 months before the trip and two weeks before I climbed 15 flights of stairs every day.Our trek was in June so I wasn't expecting blistering hot heat the first day. But it was very warm. The sun is intense and there's no escaping it. The mornings are cold. You'll need a good fleece, gloves and a hat. Then you'll strip it all off and (if you're pale like me) apply SPF 100 as soon as the sun makes its appearance in the sky. Then you'll pile it all on again at night.The Porters are incredibly hard workers. BRING MONEY TO TIP THEM. They deserve it. Those guys run the trail ahead of you, then do everything but the walking for you.You should write home about the toilets. Not because they're good, but because they're disgusting mounds of human excrement.The trail itself is a veritable smorgasbord of danger. The fun kind. The \"I can't stop my momentum on this descent and I have to tread carefully to not roll an ankle but I have to pounce like a puma\" kind of danger.It was hard, but I did it and I had a blast. If you even remotely want to do this, but are worried about your fitness level, do it. You WILL finish. It will be hard, and you might think you won't finish, but you will and you'll love it and you'll appreciate Machu Picchu so much more for having completed the trail."

We travelled with G Adventures and I can't recommend them enough. Our guides were amazing - Alex and Roger were so knowledgable and had an answer for every single one of my questions. They were likeable and loved a laugh. The porters were amazing! Carried all of our stuff and still smiled and clapped when we reached camp long after they did. They set up all of our gear, even blew up our mattresses and organised warm water for us to wash with. The food was INCREDIBLE! I can't even begin to describe how good it was! That craving for a good meal you get after a multi day hike was non-existent. I could have done with a few more days of that food. We had cake on our third day! The actual trail is a challenge, but I doubt anyone considering it would think it will be easy. They say the second day is the worst but the third day is a killer - we started at about 6am and didn't get to the next camp until around 5:30pm. It was all worth it, because at the top of every peak there are spectacular views in every direction. The ruins are beyond anything you will expect.We had the best time and can't thank G Adventures enough for this once in a lifetime experience."

You can do it, but be prepared both mentally and physically. 2. Day 2 is excruciatingly challenging - take your time. One step at a time. Going down is much harder than going up. 3.

We stayed a couple of nights in the Sacred Valley and then caught the train from Ollantaytambo to KM 104. We packed an overnight bag and porters brought that bag to our hotel in Aquas Calientes at the base of Machu Picchu. We hiked with just our backpacks and water. Hiking for just the one day allowed us to see what the Inca Trail was like without having to spend 4 days on the trail without a hotel or facilities. The trail was beautiful and strenuous at times, but very much worth it to enter Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate. I loved seeing Machu Picchu from this vantage point at first. It was so majestic seeing it from the distance and then walking down to get a better look. You will still need a guide with you to hike the Inca trail and it is so nice to then walk around Machu Picchu with your guide as he or she explains the history and architecture to you. After we spent the day hiking the Inca Trail, we spent a little time at Machu Picchu. It was then nice to go into town in Aguas Calientes for the night and spend the next day at Machu Picchu refreshed."

From the first to last day, our tour guide Efrain Quispe, chef Kin Ting, lead porter Abel and his crew were incredibly nice and supportive. When you see them running up and down the mountains carrying over 50+lbs, your pack doesn't seem as heavy any longer and you have hope you're going to make it through even the toughest day, which was Day 2 for me over Dead Woman's Pass.

The pickup was early in the morning at 6:00 and the driver dropped everybody (guide, cook, porters, us) at km 82 where the trek began. Our guide Edson was very cheerful and supportive, we had the best cook, Luis who even baked us a cake on the last evening! We had 3 porters, we were amazed about these quiet giants, so kind and so strong. Reaching the Sun Gate to have this incredible view of the Macchu Picchu on the 4th day gives you a real feeling of achievement!

We don't hike in 90% humidity and there aren't a trillion steps. We hiked the last day of the trail ending at Machu Picchu. But if you're in good shape you can do it and you will see things the other tourists will never see from the train. The views, the vistas, just beyond description and the ruins you see that others don't make it worth it. Bring lots of water and Gatorade, you will perspire as if in an 8 hour steam bath. I'm 69 and I made it, you can do and it's worth it. And the last steps are called the \"gringo killer\", so you can say you conquered that and you're through the Sun Gate and there's Machu Picchu. And the hordes of tourist who rode the train and the bus but you hiked the Inca Trail."

I've never worked so hard, or laughed so much, in my life. Dead Woman's Pass is the most challenging thing I have ever done, and I'm a fairly fit person. It pushed everyone to their limits, but everyone achieved success! There is a comradeship you develop with complete strangers along the train, and the hike offers beautiful views, lots of ruins, and Machu Picchu is a pretty cool pay off at the end of all your hard work. It was a totally rewarding experience!!!!"

We had selected Wayki Trek and chose the 5 day version - 2 of our best vacation decisions ever (and we travel a lot). The 5 day version isn't really easier but puts you out of sink with the 4 day folks in terms of campsites and trail time. Day 4 we hiked to the Sun Gate and down to Machu Picchu but had time to really enjoy the orchids and Inca sites along the way. We arrived with gorgeous lighting, then returned the next day with more energy to explore the site, visit the Inca bridge, etc. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

            "review": "Everything you need to know about the Inca Trail. There are many ways to get to Machu Picchu, but, there is only one official Inca Trail - no matter what anyone tells you about alternative routes or the jungle trek (did Incas zip line on their way to Machu Picchu....I don't think so). The Inca Trail is a spiritual experience, even for non-spiritual people like myself. It is a hard slog filled with teamwork and new friends and mouth opening, eye watering experiences,not to mention wet, freezing sleeping bags and tents, no proper toilets and steps. You arrive at Machu Picchu smelling like a swamp, looking like a cave man and feeling incredible - despite all the well heeled day trippers from Cusco who arrived on the train 5 mins earlier looking fabulously clean. Here's my 2 cents on the trail...What's different about the Inca Trail?Firstly, you need a permit for the 4 day trek/to be on any part of the trek at any given time. This needs to be booked weeks in advance of stepping on to the trail as the trail itself is a Unesco World Heritage site and only 500 people per day are permitted to enter (including between 200-250 porters and guides). The trail starts from Ollantaytambo and winds its way through interlocking valleys and archaeological sites to the sun gate - the only trail that leads directly in to Machu Picchu. We booked 6 months in advance with G Adventures and our tour included the Sacred Valley and Ollantaytambo itself. G had a great supply of tents, walking poles, foam mattresses etc for hire which made everything very easy (ish).The Trail itselfThe trek is not easy, especially with the altitude and many, many steps. However, it is made a lot easier by the incredible porters who carry your night packs, tents, food etc. The chefs who cook amazing three course lunches and dinners every day. And of course, the guides who are so passionate about the Inca Trail and Peru, it really takes you to a place where you can feel the history in the air. I would definitely recommend some training in the form of cross training, endurance hikes or short, very steep hikes prior to setting out - it'll make the trek more fun. I wouldn't say you need to be super fit to do the trail but a good level of fitness would definitely be beneficial. If you suffer from bad knees, I'd probably think twice about the trek.The first day is very moderate, small hills to the first base camp.Day 2 brings the massive climb to a rest area before one even tackles dead woman's pass. Then it's downhill to base camp number two set beside a waterfall. Day 3 is more a test of endurance, there are steps up, and down. There are valleys and cloud forests and miles and miles to the next camp. But, you get to a point where you see Machu Picchu mountain, the goal is in sight and the historic sites along the way are breathtaking. Day 4 is an early start, 3am for us. You queue at the entrance to the hike to the sun gate until it opens at 5am. The last 45 minute hike around a mountain with sheer drops is adrenaline filled, then you reach the prize of Machu Picchu.What to take.You need a camel pack for water, a good one that doesn't leak. A light day pack with just the essentials. Thermals. Walking poles (I don't use these generally but rented them from G Adventures and they were invaluable). Good hiking boots. Anti bac gel. Baby wipes. Toilet paper. A micofibre travel towel. A pack of cards. Diamox tablets for altitude. Take anti bacterial tablets in advance to prep your stomach for the treated water on the trail. The obvious medication: immodium, motilium etcWhat Company?We went with G Adventures and they were superb! Percy was an exceptional guide having hiked the Inca Trail over 750 times!!! His experience and passion was palpable (no more so than when he pulled out a wooden Andean flute and started playing it in the valleys). He made the experience spiritual and fun. Arriving to the sun gate first, before any other group was insane. Fantastic photo ops with the sun beaming down on Machu Picchu with no other tourist in sight.All in all, this was the highlight of our four months in South America. It was incredible. I couldn't recommend this trail enough for everyone who is able and willing. It's hard, but not impossible and definitely worth every step!"

I enjoyed doing some walking in the Andes - the scenery was fantastic.The trail does, of course, culminate in your first view of MP being from high up at the Sun Gate. I'm so glad this was my first view, rather than entering from below with the daytrippers. The trail is worth doing for the walk and also for this.The piles of litter and poop others talk about wasn't in evidence anywhere near like implied. Sure, if you pick a good spot on the trail to go, you can bet others will have found it first - so watch your step or spray from a distance - or go more than 2 steps off the trail.It also didn't feel that busy - people spread out and I/we were often out of sight and sound of other groups.This is a must do trek for any hill walker."

            "review": "Pro Photographer: advice on how to get great trail photos. I just returned from a terrific experience on the trail. If your an amateur photographer and want to bring back some great images...read on:1. You can't take great shots if your on the Bataan Death March. Get in cardio shape before you travel. Remember to: stay hydrated on the hike, gobble down 150 cals per hour of fuel (power bars, real food) and use Nuuns tablets. Nuuns replaces all the potassium and magnesium you'll be sweating out at high alt. Want to avoid leg cramps descending ... use Nuuns!!! If you feel good...you'll be more creative behind the lens.2. Don't overdo the equipment. One SLR body and two lenses will do the trick. I suggest one wide angle zoom (16-35mm range) and a medium zoom (70-200mm). The first is perfect for the landscape shots, the latter for locals you encounter on the way, wildlife and isolating mountain features. I brought F4 glass...tack sharp..don't bring heavy F2.8 lens...no point...too heavy!!!3. Tripod: Send with the porters. You won't need on the trail...you will need at camp for early am shots, dusk and evening shots of the stars! Don't forget your remote shutter release.4, Get a camera back-pack that's mean't for hiking. Super IMP. I have a Clik Elite Venture 35 ($100 now at BH Photo). It's a camera bag that's mean't for long treks. Distributes the weight between my shoulders and hip belt. Offers easy access to water pockets or Camelbak pouch and keeps the weight close to my back. Lots of good choices...just make sure you find one that's comfortable.5. When to shoot Machu Picchu: The time of day and lighting is critical to getting memorial pictures of this iconic place. I was fortunate to hike down into MP from the Sun Gate late in the day. Because the sun was low in the sky, I got some great photos. Likewise, after you arrive, the following day getting to MP right when it opens at 6am is critical if you want to grab cool shots just as the sun is shining over the surrounding mountains. Get there early and hike up as high as possible to have the best vantage point for sunrise. The sun will typically hit the ruins about 40 minutes after normal sunrise...since it take a little while for the sun to clear the mountain tops that surround the site."

Also experienced some altitude sickness in the middle of the night while on the Inca Trail. I was able to beat it by drinking water. But that after waking up with headache and nausea.I would recommend guides who are knowledgeable of the terrain and history. This is an amazing trail. It wasn't crowded when we were there.

They are fantastic!I'm all about the hiking trails when I travel. And to get to Machu Picchu there are many different hikes. Although the Inca Trail is definitely the most crowded, it also has the most history. There are many ruins to explore along the trail and if you have a decent guide he/she can fill you in with all the rich Incan history. The views, particularly on the last full day of the hike, are stunning and I found myself stopping every once and a while just to take it all in. I have hiked many trails through many mountains in the past few years but nothing will compare to the majesty of those views on our last day. Breathtaking. Our guide made sure that we finished up at Sun Gate around sunrise to take in Machu Picchu at it's best and it's a sight I will never forget.Something to note is that the trail is mostly made of stone staircases. So it's a lot of steep up and downs. I did Kilimanjaro 3 years ago and I found the Incan Trail to be more challenging, simply because of all the up and downs. It can be hard on the knees. Also at the highest point, I believe you climb to just about 14000ft. So bring some coco leaves or candy to help out with altitude sickness as well as drinking lots of water.Again, a once in a lifetime experience that you should try to enjoy. Highly recommended."

As people in our 50s, we certainly prepared but weren't able to train for the effects of the high altitude. We took two different approaches on Day 2: keep up with the pack and pay for it with sore muscles or take your time and suffer longer due to the altitude. Both worked!The scenery and ruins along the way were both amazing and to be honest we were more impressed by them than by Machu Picchu itself. Machu Picchu was full of day trippers and the crowds were overwhelming!We did the tour with LlamaPath. We had a great experience with them. Our guide, Roger, was a lot of fun, very experienced, with a great attitude. Oscar, our second guide, was very caring and interested in all of us.

The most common way I believe it is enjoyed by tourists is a four day, three night hike starting outside Ollantaytambo and finishing over the Sun Gate in Machu Picchu. With some pretty severe elevation climbs you had better be in good shape to tackle this seemingly \"easy\" hike.

I cannot recommend this experience enough. Though be warned; we are experienced hikers, and agreed that this trek was tougher than the route to Everest Basecamp(!)Amazingly, our three favourite Inca sites were actually along the trail en route to Machu Picchu, and not Machu Picchu itself. This consensus was shared by much of our trekking group. Just taking the train and bus to Machu Picchu means we would have missed half a dozen utterly unique and stunning ruins, and the vistas between them.Make sure that you are fit before attempting this challenge: not just so that you are able to enjoy it, but also so that you are able to actually complete it.Spend decent money on your gear: walking boots with ankle support, trekking trousers, lightweight sweat-wicking tops, a day pack, a poncho, sunglasses, a sun-hat, a water reservoir or drinking bottles...

It should go without saying, but if you're going to hike for 4 days and camp outside for 3 days, you should be prepared. Get good boots. Get a good pack. Get functional clothes - breathable, sweat wicking, etc. Get in shape as it will pay off. The first day is relatively easy, the second is the hardest because of a ~3 hour climb to the highest point (~14,000 feet) at Dead Woman's Pass then most of the trail is downhill to Machu Picchu. Of course there are uphills to tackle on Days 3 and 4 but on balance, it's downhill. The sights are unparalleled, with high peaks all around. The valleys are a sight to behold as are the ancient forts and villages along the way that have been restored. When you arrive to MP, you're definitely tired but take time to appreciate your surroundings (though there are crowds). We decided to stay at a hotel in the valley overnight and return the next day - another opportunity to absorb the beauty and wonder of MP but easier to appreciate because you have a good night's rest and a good meal under your belt. Not to be missed if you can do it."

The Inca trail is iconic and one of those things that no matter how hard it was during the trip, you will feel great once it's done with memories to last a life time. It is difficult, the altitude affects everyone differently but almost everyone is affected somehow. There are about 500 people on each part of the track each day and everyone makes the distance in their own way. The things I didn't like about my trip was seeing the effort the porters had to go to to make our trip possible. I realise this is important work for the people of this region but having three people drop what they were doing and scramble to hold water, soap and towel every time I wanted to wash my hands made me uncomfortable. The reality is that I have camped much more comfortably with less equipment and no staff. The tents we had were the old triangle style with virtually no room inside and everything that touched the edge through the night got soaking wet despite ground sheets inside and out. I'm pretty sure you can't buy these tents anymore because dome tents are so much more practical. Also who ever thought that a seat over a bucket with a small plastic bag to share amongst all of us was a suitable solution for a toilet was wrong. The public Banos were primitive but at least it wasn't personal."

I will never forget the smell of the later part of the hike. fresh and serene. I felt as though I was in a movie set after the second day-the Inca trail is lined with Jungle flora and fauna- breathtaking to the point of tears. The stairs are not joke and not for the weak mind. I cannot say I would do this again but I will never forget this experience and accomplishment in my life."

You get off the train at Km104 - the train conductor speaks clearly and you have a full 3 minutes to disembark. You still need a permit but they were easy to get. The 13km hike gives you a really nice flavor of the trail. The first half of the trail is a lot of uphill followed by generally flatter trail before an uphill ending. It's a moderately challenging hike and will take several hours. The trail goes thru the Wi\u00f1aywayna ruins which are awesome and deserve a 5 star review in and of themselves. A guide on the trail is nice but not necessary. Make sure to carry plenty of water. Once you meet up with the regular 4 day Inca trail (after Wi\u00f1aywayna) there are a lot more hikers on the path."

But nothing is better than hiking the Inca Trail over a 4 day 3 night expedition. You need to be fit. You need to understand the challenges of altitude climbing and lack of oxygen. With your 'I Am Going to Do This' attitude, and your best level of fitness that you have possibly mastered in your preparation, you will have a sense of achievement like no other (to a non-climber!). The weather is very unpredictable and do not expect any comforts at all, you will sleep on the hard ground in your Arctic sleeping bag and have early morning starts. In saying all this, all that's left to say is you need to do it yourself to know a new meaning of the word 'incredible', I haven't even started on the spiritual aspects, the lost ruins en route, the tiny narrow tracks, the Sun Gate and Machu Picchu.

Every aspect of the tour was fantastic starting with the email communication regarding my booking to the actual trip. Both our tour guides (Henry and Joyce) and our team of Porters and chefs were outstanding and made the experience so memorable. It really is amazing what is achieved, the food is absolutely delicious (hotel standard) and you never go hungry or thirsty. They even cooked a birthday cake for one member of our team and decorated the tent with balloons and streamers. The tour guides explain everything really clearly and help you every step of the way. It's a tough hike and you need to be physically fit and prepared to climb up and down a fair distance/height in all weather conditions as well as cope with early mornings for the whole trip. Day 2 is very tough like everyone says but I personally found Day 3 harder as there was a lot of downhill which was hard on my knees. The guides are constantly with you encouraging you the whole way. I've enjoyed every minute and the view of Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate is unbelievable. Definitely do this trip, tick it off your bucket list and go with this company. 'The Green Machine' will make it an experience you'll never forget. Thank you so much Alpaca Expeditions!"

I chose the 4 day version which passed a number of archaeological sites, some amazing views in the cloud forest and probably the best campsite in the world!! The trek itself is tough - steep steps up and down. We were walking for 6-7 hours a day. Walking poles are a must - I had never used them before and think people who use them on the flat in the UK are bonkers but when you have to climb down steps for 2 hours that are 35-50cms.... take poles!! Amazing experience to get to Machu Picchu and I would highly recommend this trek... the only thing that stops me saying it was a \"must do\" is that it is physically demanding - it is at altitude (4,200 ish at Dead Woman's Pass) and it is tough going at times. I would recommend a good level of physical fitness either experienced at long walks or regular aerobic exercise. Depending on fitness level you will need a good level of mental resilience. The less fit members of our group endured rather than enjoyed the trek!! Our tour group was Exodus / Peak South America."

Alert you that is harder than described and not something I will recommend to people with knee problems. But the history and natural history surrounding this hike is unique. The second day that includes reaching the Dead Women Pass is as difficult as its reputation. But even in a rainy day with poor visibility it was special to visit. The last phase of our hike, four hours of steep downhill hiking to reach the Sun Gate was as difficult but not something I read about in any of the reviews before the trip. The redeeming quality was the fact that we entered the Sun Gate in a blue sky sunny morning. We definitely felt love by the Mountain Gods (Apus). The one rainy day allowed me to experience the beauty of the mist and forced me to focus on the flowers and natural beauty closer to me. If March, consider the rainy season, is the only choice you have for doing the Inca Trail, do not hesitate to embark in this amazing experience."

Each day we saw and experienced amazing things - Inca ruins, mountain views, glaciers, birds, plants, animals, etc. Something new and interesting around every corner/over every hill. It's not for the feint of heart. It was a physical challenge at times. You need to be in fairly good shape - trekking 30 miles in 4 days with two climbs to to 14,000 feet on the trail. But, we were as prepared as we could be. We booked through Valencia Travel in Cusco and they were excellent. Ask to have Eder (Ed) as your guide - 5 Stars - and you won't be disappointed. He's a wealth of knowledge about the Inca people and the trail. Always friendly. He kept the whole 4-day adventure lighthearted and fun. And, if you can, get Jaun de Dios - 5 Stars - as your chef on the trek. Every meal was better than the next. This was not hot dogs and beans. 4-course dinners were the norm. A 5-Star tenting experience with a dozen of the toughest, most hardworking porters going out of their way to look after our group every step of the way. Machu Picchu itself was awe-inspiring. Would love to have been able to spend more time there exploring. Read blogs. Be aware of the season you travel. It will influence packing/clothing/accessories - example: we went in March and rain gear was essential. Facilities aren't as primitive as I was lead to believe. But, they weren't overly used either as we trekked the first week after the annual February closure of the trail. And, the trail wasn't busy yet. But it can get busy. If you have a thought about going book it. And, book it with Valencia."

The ruins that you see on the way to Machu Picchu are quite impressive and almost more enjoyable than Machu Picchu because there are so few people around and you can really enjoy the history, the solitude and the views. Really experiencing the miles of very uneven and steep steps and feeling the effects of the altitude helped me appreciate what the Incas accomplished. My family did this trek for my 50th birthday and it was definitely one of the best experiences I have ever had. (Exhausting, but sooo worth it!) We booked the 4D/3N trek with Llama Path and they were wonderful! I will review them separately but I would highly recommend them if you are going to take the trek."

Third day is long (16 km) and mostly down (harder on joints than up) but the most scenic day. Weather in mid March was fantastic! Food was unbelievably good. The last day is a very early wake up for a short, easy 2 hour hike to the sun gate. Required items: sunscreen, broad brim hat, hand sanitizer (the squat toilets are kind of grouse), tech towel (more opportunities to wash up than expected) and soap, good hiking boots. I would not recommend trail runners (my daughter wore them and need more support and sturdier sole). Have a great trip!"

I had an amazing experience and so much was made by the group hiked with and our guides .. love you guys!! SAS insisted on us using walking poles - they were a life saver. So many steps going up and down - make sure you use the stair master for a month before the trek! I have no idea of how other people did this trek without poles. Freddy & Emerson told us how to handle the trek to have the best experience for us. The food was amazing, tents great, view out of this world, and the first campsite in particular was spectacular! It's very confronting to have porters carry your stuff all the way - that's morally a bit of a challenge. I understand they have a job but still its very very tough to watch them carry those huge loads. It was amazing finally getting to the Sun Gate and seeing Machu Picchu - a HUGE sense of achievement but Machu Picchu is a bit of a circus with hundreds of tourists and while incredible and so happy I have seen this amazing place, for me the trek itself was more momentous. Such an achievement and thank you to my fellow trekkers, Freddy, Emerson and our porters for making this the life changing experience that it was!"

We saw more with this guide and enjoyed the hikes to the different areas. It was a warm day and we all used insect repellant on exposed arms, face, neck , legs. I ended up taking off my top layer of long sleeve shirt exposing my arms and rolled up my pant legs. What a mistake, I must have had over 200 bites all over from the no-see-um tiny mosquito like creatures. I itched for weeks. The guide was worried because after going back to town, my ankles were so swollen, I could hardly walk. The guide brought medicine from the pharmacy to apply for itching and antahistamine (same as the one I had, zyrtec, cetrizine) . I had scars from the bites, but I have since recovered after seeing my MD upon arrival USA. I had caused bites to get infected and required antibiotics to control the itching and swelling!"

We coupled the Machu Picchu visit with a one-day hike of the Inca Trail (what most tour guides call the 2 day / 1 night Inca Trail hike). This consists of a full day of hiking the Inca Trail on the 1st day, staying at the town of Aguas Calientes (many trying to change the name of the town to Machu Picchu City for marketing/tourist reasons) and then visiting Machu Picchu the 2nd day before departing back for Cuzco that afternoon. We booked this 2D/1N tour through the tour company, United Mice, who are based in Cuzco and therefore have native knowledge of tour rules, local laws, up-to-the-second regional news, etc. We were VERY pleased with United Mice.We had already visited Cuzco / Machu Picchu a couple of times before, so we didn't want to do the most common Cuzco to M.P. trip by train route which we'd previously already done.Also, the longer, more traditional Inca Trail hike of 4 days / 3 nights, where one actually sleeps in tents along the trail for a few nights, was a bit too long for us. a 4D/3N hike would require about 6 days in Cuzco/Machu Picchu region and the 2D/1N we did needed about 4 days in the Cuzco/MP area. Because of time constraints, we chose the shorter version of the hike, because we didn't have the time for the longer version, but wanted at least a taste of the Inca Trail.Following is our rough itinerary / tips:DAY 1 - Arrive into Cuzco in an afternoon flight from Lima. Not too much problem for me, my wife and two sons, with the altitude although a few do encounter altitude sickness. We had already toured Cuzco on a couple of previous occasions, so we simply relaxed and had a nice dinner at world-famous, Peruvian chef, Gaston Acurio's restaurant called \"Chicha\" just a couple of blocks from the main square (Plaza de Armas). Chicha was very good.The 2D/1N hike was organized by a Cuzco-based tour group called, United Mice. They did an excellent job of getting us everything we wanted, including the Huayna Picchu hike on January 1st, 2016, which wasn't made available to the public by the Peruvian government until just a day before the hike. We were VERY satisfied with United Mice and the U.M. tour guide they provided, Walter.DAY 2 - United Mice sent a taxi to pick us up at around 3 a.m. at our Wyndham hotel in Cuzco, and it took us to a van in downtown Cuzco which collected several tourists from a few of the Cuzco hotels before taking off for a halfway point between Cuzco and MP: The town of Ollantaytambo. For those that are interested, I understand that there are some Inca ruins in that town, and one can spend a day, or so, and stay at an Ollantaytambo hotel if they'd like to further explore that \"Sacred Valley\" area.The drive to Ollantaytambo took about 1 1/2 hours by van. It stopped at a gas station once when a few of the passengers wanted to use a bathroom.We boarded the train at Ollantaytambo (very comfortable cars each with a bathroom in each car), which served a small snack/drink for breakfast, and it dropped us off at mile market 104 to begin the hike. There is no train station at mile marker 104, so make sure you have everything you need for the hike (water, snacks, bug spray, sun screen, etc.) before you get dropped off. Use the train bathroom before you get dropped because, afterward, during the hike, you will need to use the great outdoors as your bathroom. :-) United Mice did provide us with a lunch box at the start of the hike for us to take on our hike (sandwich, a couple of fruits, granola bar, juice, etc.). If you want more to eat, make sure you bring some snacks (ie, trail mix, water, etc.) for an 8 to 8 1/2 hour hike - It can be done faster, or slower, depending on your pace. The tour guides will walk as slow, or as fast, as the pace you set, so don't worry if you think you'll be a slower hiker. They don't mind.From there, at about 7:30 a.m., we began our hike of the Inca Trail and soon after the hike started, visited the Chachabamba ruins. The hike took us through some beautiful mountain vistas, very green, sub tropical flora and fauna We also saw a couple of pretty water falls along the way.. Some of the hiking was a little tough (relatively Inca stone steps) and some was fairly easy (relatively flat walk along the middle of these very \"green\" mountains. If one doesn't have trouble with the altitude, like we didn't, then the hike should not be too much of a problem. We each took a small/medium-sized back pack with all of the clothes / toiletries we'd need for the 4 days in Cuzco/MP. Don't forget to leave a little room in the pack for the lunch box / juice that you'll get from the United Mice, or whichever tour company you use.By lunch time, we arrived at the Winay Wayna ruins - A very pretty series of terraces that were built for farming during the Inca years. We had lunch at the ruins while our excellent United Mice tour guide, Walter, explained the history of this ruin. In fact, along the entire hike, Walter added great commentary about the ruins, Inca history and pointed out many of the flowers (lots of different type of orchids, etc.) and fauna. He did a great job (in English, although we all understood Spanish as well and Walter also spoke the local Quechua language and I overheard him speaking in Japanese with a couple of tourist the following day in MP).After Winay Wayna, we hiked for a couple more hours until we arrived at the very popular Inca Sun Gate where we got our first glimpse of the MP ruins from afar. It was still about a 1 to 1 1/2 hour hike from that vantage point, but the gorgeous sight of MP gave us that \"boost\" we needed to complete the 8 to 8 1/2 hour hike. That it was New Years eve, made that sight even more special. Some tourists that only visit MP, make the hike from MP to the Sun Gate to take pictures, etc. So, this is where the hikers that have either been on the 4D/3N or, like us, the 2D/1N hike first run into the MP-only tourists.We arrived at MP around 4:30 p.m. which gave us about an hour to take some pics at the ruins before the last bus departed MP for the town of Aguas Calientes (about a 20-30 minute bus ride down a switch-back road. We toured Machu Picchu/Huayna Picchu on DAY 3 and did the 4th tallest bungee in the world (Action Valley, Cuzco) on DAY 4. Those summaries can be found on separate reviews.DAY 3 - This day consisted of a visit to Machu Picchu, climb up Huayna Picchu (at the MP archeological site) and trip back to Cuzco. I discuss the MP portion on Day 3 and a bungee jump from the 4th tallest bungee in the world (Action Valley, Cuzco) on Day 4, in a separate review.All in all, a wonderful trip that was highlighted by both the Inca Trail hike and MP visit. I highly recommend this to everyone who is considering a trip to see the spectacular MP ruins."

You stop to think of all the work to build the incredible Inca Trail here and all the other trails throughout the Andes connecting all the Inca villages at that time, the Inca terraces for farming and retention and then of course all the Inca cities, temples and houses. While Machu Picchu deserves to be call one of the 7 Wonders of the World - the Inca Trail really is huge part of its magic and Inca history."

This had always been a bucket list item for both of us, but I do not believe that either of us were prepared for the breathtaking views of the Peruvian landscape, the Andes, and the Incan ruins along the trek. It was visually intoxicating, and both he and I are still reeling from everything. About us: Neither my brother nor I are seasoned hikers. We are both in our mid- to late-twenties, former athletes (I use the term loosely in my case) and are in descent enough shape. Neither of us had any particularly rigorous prior experience nor training, which led to some trepidation and unease which in the end was completely unfounded. Though the second day and portions of the third day were difficult (four-day hike), the hike itself was rather doable and incredibly gratifying. We did prophylactically take Diamox, which I felt helped immensely in acclimating to the altitude. I could not recommend the Inca Trail, Machu Picchu, and Cusco/Aguascalientes more!! We booked with: ADIOS ADVENTURE TRAVEL and could not say greater things about their complete service!DO IT!"

It was a demanding but extremely rewarding hike, with a spiritual value attached to it that made us feel very proud and enriched.Although best suited for experienced hikers, the Inca Trail hike is feasible by anybody in decent shape. For instance, if you are in good health and are used to run 40-50 miles per month it will not be too hard.You should book well in advance: at least 6 months if you plan to go during high season, which is in June. It is very important to select a tour operator with a good reputation, which guarantees your safety despite the risks associated with the altitude (the highest point of the Trail is 4215m) and the poor infrastructure along the Trail. I highly recommend to choose a 100% local tour operator that treats porters well. There are a few available in Cusco, see my older reviews for a specific recommendation."

I trained a bit before hand, but the altitude WILL play a role, no matter what, so be prepared for that side of things. The other key thing was to mentally not psych yourself out, because it IS possible to do it. The best advice that I was given when I found myself having a really hard time after the first hill on the first day, seriously doubting that I'd be able to complete the full trek: Don't stop. Just keep going... but if you are moving so fast that you can't have a conversation, you need to slow down. It's not a race, it's all about keeping a pace that you can endure for a long time. I felt like I tricked my mind into thinking all the ground was the same by never really changing from that pace, even on flat parts. I had my ACL and meniscus repaired on my left knee about a year ago, so wore my custom brace for the entirety of the trek. I was happy I did. My knee lasted, and I felt that much safer knowing I had the extra support. I HIGHLY recommend the use of two trekking poles.Unreal views, absolutely a must do bucket list item for anybody who hast the mental fortitude and is in reasonable shape. Our trekking partners were 57 and 77 respectively, I was so inspired by their attitude and ability to get through! Carry lots of bandaids, a good water bottle, proper hiking boots...I'd also say it is worth it to pay to have somebody carry your tent/sleeping bag and about 6Kg of your stuff, this is what most tours will offer as a part of the package. The rest you can manage on your back - but do NOT pack heavy, there's no need!Good luck, I'll never, ever forget the amazing experiences I had on that trail. Whether when with other trekkers, or just those serene moments in absolute silence above the clouds by myself...."

Agreed with all the comments from the other posts - fantastic trek, amazing sights and history, blah, blah, blah, - so I won't bore you with all the details. Just some dot point tips; 1. get reasonably fit before the trek (The fitter you are, the more you will enjoy it) 2. travel light, light, light3. take a walking pole or two (buy them in Cusco $8 AUD)4. use Gore Tex walking boots and jacket - if it rains, these are great5. a warm jacket is essential - it gets cold6. Stay an extra night (or two) at Aguas Calienties after the trek and do Huayna Picchu (that's the mountain behind Machu Picchu) the next day. This needs to be booked well in advance.Overall the trek was fantastic - but the tour company (Peru Treks and Adventure) was average - very average, to say the least. Did the research, checked the reviews, and settled on this company. Problems started at the check in. Peru woman in the office at 7.30pm was downright rude. We had a few questions and the response was \"haven't you read the information provided?\". The information provided is 8 pages long, consists of about 10,000 words and is very confusing. Next time I will commit this PhD length thesis to memory - not!!! The group we had was 16. In my humble opinion was too big. Most of the group had never trekked before - which was obvious from the back pack set ups they were carrying. The guides did nothing to fix these problems - so it was left to me to check, adjust and secure these packs on the inexperienced trekkers. There were 3 people on the trek in serious doubt of finishing due to unfitness. Again, it was left to me to keep an eye on them.For example, on one occasion we arrived in camp to find both the guides in the main tent warm and dry whilst two of the weakest trekkers were struggling 3-4 hours behind (in the rain at 4200m) to make it to the camp site. When I voiced my concern over this poor man to the guides I was met with stone cold silence. Again, in my humble opinion a serious lack of concern for the welfare of the group. This was on the 2nd day when we crossed the highest mountain at 4200m - Breakfast at 6.00am but lunch was at 2.30pm - Over 8 hours later!!!! Why - so the porters only had to set up once.On the last day we arrived in Machu Picchu at approx. 9.00am , the plan was to meet as a group for lunch at 2.00pm. Why? - Only then could we collect our return train tickets to Cusco. Reason for this - so the guides could get their tip!!!!! This leaves a scant 3 hours to see all the sights of Machu Picchu.In Summary I feel that the tour was tailored to the comfort of the guides and porters rather than the comfort and welfare of the paying trekkers. Also a focus on getting tips at the end of the trek by holding us to ransom so we meet for lunch is a little underhanded. If they want a tip - here's one - \" look after the group in a professional manner\" , then perhaps I would feel comfortable parting with my hard earned cash!!!. Needless to say no tip was forthcoming. Would I recommend doing the trek? - YES - an absolutely a once in a life time experience. Would I recommend Peru Treks and Adventure? - NO. Spend your money on a company that provides better service."

We started out early (but were delayed considerably by bus transport, stops, etc.) and day one of the trail could almost have fit into the second version. I am in reasonable shape - hike, rock climb, do yoga an run - but am not in GREAT shape, admittedly. Even so, I found the Inca Trail to be challenging. Day one is \"Inca flats\" which means up and downs. My husband and I were carrying our own pack and gear so were more laden than many of our cohorts but even so we enjoyed it and settled down to camp at the end of day not too tired or sore. Day 2 is meant to be the most difficult so we jettisoned a lot of stuff (that we shouldn't even have brought in the first place) and set out. Something about it being straight up and the hardest day made it manageable - there was no site-seeing, there was no point in crying and moaning - it was just one foot in front of the other until we were done. And so we stumbled into camp on day 2 exhausted but proud. However, day 3 was another thing altogether. It was touted as 'the sight-seeing day' but actually was the longest day of hiking by far (16 ish kms I believe?) and it was amazing! So many ruins that the trail just 'passed by' and the gorgeous scenery of the high jungle. But it was hard. I used up most of my 'oomph' on Day 2 and presented with a steep uphill climb on Day 3 I started to despair. Up up up, then down down down down...my toenails turned black and my weak ankle rolled all over the place. The stops at Inca ruins were amazing and restorative - imagine sitting down to rest at the self same spot that was used in pre-Colombian times! - but eventually my will gave out over my body and I had to sit down and have a cry that we weren't at the camp yet. Ultimately, it was an amazing experience that I'm glad I have had but it's important to remember that it's at least as much emotional as it is physical and to keep a little of both in store for what's to come."

Of course it a pretty strenuous hike....its not the distance but the elevation, 3 passes and steep downhill that can hurt you and for some the inconvenience of not having a proper toilet/ shower. I backpacked the whole way without a porter, carrying about 38 lbs. Day 1 is generally a pretty easy day, with couple of Inca site on the way, Day 2 - Hike to Dead woman's pass and beyond was challenging. As you climb the steep step to reach 4210 m above MSL, you can feel the air gets progressively thinner. Day 3 is generally the longest day, depending on your allotted camp site and you will go through what is called the Gringo killer. Really steep downhill hike, takes a toll on your knees. Day 4 starts really very early, actually as early as 2 am for some groups. It is gradual up and down trail, but beware of people with poor hiking etiquette. These are guys racing to reach the sun gate before everyone, I really don't understand why they do this and put other people in danger. One of the fellow hikers in my group was injured because of one such idiot. Anyway, eventually you reach Sun gate for a beautiful and rewarding view of Machu Picchu. This is a good place to take pictures. From this point, Machu Picchu is just than an hour away.Talking about fellow hikers, I was blessed with a great group of people... similar pace and energy level, but that depends totally on your luck.Overall, the terrain you go through and the views that you have are stunning. Snow capped mountains, wet cloud forest, the deep valley with the untamed Orabamba river flowing and just the towering mountains around you is unmatched.If you are phycially in good shape and do not have any issues with altitude, this trail is predominantly a mental challenge.Few tips:1. Altitude sickness can kill your experince - so please make sure to get to Cusco or Puno a few days ahead so that you can get aclamitized to the condition. I did a couple of 4000+m hike in and around Puno and that helped me a lot.2. Backpacking by yourself is a good challenge to take up, but Know your physical capability and pack smartly. I rented my sleeping bag from the travel company and they quite heavy (4.5 lbs) and at high altitude every pound matters. I would suggest you to get your own sleeping bag and pads (probably the lightest possible ones) 3. If you are just a casual travel, looking to enjoy the scenery then hire a porter (Just robs you off the bragging rights... but you still did the Inca trail) 4. Please remember this for everyone's safety -Hiking rule #1 - if you want to pass someone, them know that you are behind that and you intend to pass. Rule #2 - Pass on the valley side and not on the mountain side."

The Inca Trail only host 500 people per day and half of those are the workers that support all of the hikers/tourist. The 4 day trek is doable for most any 20-40 year old in good physical condition. Some of the climbs can be difficult, but the pace is very manageable and the guide will help you along the way to maintain a pace so you can finish the entire trek. Along the trek you will visit half a dozen Inca sites enroute to Machu Picchu. An amazing trip that should be at the top of your list when you visit Latin America. Plan far in advance as the available spots go fast."

Pack a light backpack the lighter the better it will feel on day 2 and try to have longsleved shirts and pants to avoid insect bites and the sun. Also bring some cash in small bills to buy water and pay for some of the cleaner toilets. The toilets at camp are not the cleanest ones and can gett pretty nasty. Also they are the squating kind and not the typical western toilet. You have to bring your own toilett paper.

At the last avalible water stop, a bottle of water coulf be 10 soles or more. Porters can be hired to carry the personal belongings, which was what I did since my backpack wasn't adequately equipped and the sleeping bag I rented from the company weighted a quite a bit.

Be warned that there are many many steps both up and down (3000 down on the third day) and if you have any trouble with your knees take plenty of Ibuprofen! Most of our party suffered at some point or other, even the younger ones so don't let anybody tell you it's a breeze.On the plus side you will definitely feel a sense of achievement and experience some great scenery and sense of camaraderie.Would thoroughly recommend but try to get as fit as you can before you attempt it.

For those who do not want to commit to the grueling 4 days trek but still want to experience one of the most world sought after trail leading to Machu Picchu, I would definitely do the short Inca Trail during the wet season. We went in early November the beginning of the rain season, with light rain, clouds and little bit of mud, that made the hike refreshing, cool and doable when climbing uphill and carrying a heavy back pack (trekking poles a must). I can't imagine doing the trek during the hot dry season, the sun at that high elevation hitting you directly is hot and excruciating leading to heat exhaustion (well for me that is). As everyone mentioned the trek is difficult and not for the faint of heart. With a positive attitude, will power and physical endurance (do not recommend for those who have bad knees) most people can get through this. We went with Sam's Travel Peru and highly recommend using them, they are by far the most economically priced, professional, and from A-Z organized and handled everything for us. The reward you get from accomplishing the hike is the view of Machu Picchu in all it's glory. Definitely a bucket list trip of a lifetime."

Having a tent toilet is nice - even more so for our female travelers.While Machu Picchu is the ultimate goal, the other ruins along the way provide a fabulous \"appetizer\" and give you a greater appreciation for the extent of the Incan culture/empire. It also left me with a less than favorable impression of the Spanish conquistadores but, as they say, history is written by the victors. Please remember that the oxygen content drops by 2% per 1000 feet of altitude. When you top Dead Woman's Pass, the oxygen content is about 26% less than at sea level. The pace isn't hard, but the altitude will challenge you. That being said, if you stay hydrated, pace yourself and wear the appropriate gear/clothing you will be fine! Go for it!"

I wasn't looking forward to 4 days of hiking but somehow it was fun and an experience and achievement I will never forget.I highly recommend the classic Inca trail to anyone visiting South America. I know the bus and the train sound like a better option at the time, but the satisfaction you get from achieving the real trek is totally worth it!"

The Classic Inka Trail was a bucket list item and we DID IT!The trek itself was difficult due to altitude and stairs....I have NEVER seen so many stairs in so many different sizes and shapes....(if you are planning the Classic Inka Trail, practice STAIRS and lunges). The better condition you are in the more you will enjoy the trip.It was the hardest thing we have ever done, but the most rewarding. The views are absolutely incredible and breathtaking. We were so very fortunate to have excellent weather. We got a bit of rain one evening and then rain after we arrived at Machu Picchu, but otherwise it was clear. The stairs would have been so much more difficult had they been wet.DO:*Research the trek company and choose wisely (we picked Llama Path and they were awesome) *Use insect repellent or you will be feasted upon (you don`t necessarily see them but they will get you)*Ensure you break in your boots before the trek*Take or rent poles *Use a hydration pack to keep your hands free*Use sunscreen*Take a variety of medication (Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, anti-diarrhea, antibiotic, antihistamine)*Pack only essentials (do your homework on this)Take time to enjoy the views along the way as they are magnificent. Also take time to reflect on the talents and efforts of the Inka people to cut and lay each stone on the trail in addition to building all of the sites along the way."

The second day is the most challenging as the climb is 1200 metres up to 4200 metres at Dead Woman's Pass followed by lots of steps downhill to the camp. However the 4th morning when you reach the Sun Gate and walk down in to Macchu Picchiu is the most spectacular. The scene is simply beautiful with MP unfolding below you through the mist - really magical !!! Everyone should experience this !! Only downside were the sandflies in MP - they ate us alive and we were still scratching 2 weeks later - awful bites !!! Be aware of this !!!"

However, we did hear and lot of people complaining and suffering on the walk, I suspect they don't usually do much hiking. So be warned, if you don't like walking, you may have a bad time! You might be better catching the train to Machu Picchu. It is a hard walk due to the altitude and steepness, especially if you're used to sea level. Still, it is doable if you take it slow and steady.The walk itself is great, and not as crowded as I expected. You can often end up walking alone with noone else in sight (well, assuming you don't book through one of the big conga-line companies, aim for a small operation!)The porters carry the tents/food/etc and you can pay extra to have to carry personal gear (again, system depends on who you book through). The trail, camping areas and toilets are well maintained and on the first 2 days there are places to buy drink/food.We were very tired once we reached Machu Picchu though, and my legs hurt for days!"

Visiting Machu Pichu was something that I had been dreaming as a college student, and 10 years later I could make this come true when I finally took the journey to South America and visited Peru. My husband and I did the Classic Inca Trail 4 day trek and after a lot of back and forth emails, reading TA reviews, and talking (Skype conversations) we finalized on Pachamama explorers. They were very good in the planning of the trek including the vegetarian food (the best we had in all of our South America trip), the Inca knowledge which our guide (Gerson) had and imparted during the trek, and porters who did a marvellous job of carrying the paraphernalia to set up camp and dining areas. The only thing that definitely needs an uplift are the toilets on the way and near the camps, and which is something the authorities must immediately work on.The trek is called \"moderately\" difficult, and I had prepared for it (being a generally unfit person with hardly any outdoor activity) by three months of regular gyming. I found it difficult in places, and struggled in the second half of Day 2 (And of course in familiarising on Day 1). Day 3 was also a much more pleasant and beautiful trek and Day 4 was half a day. The view of MP is such an exhilerating feeling, that one needs to be there to experience."

With willpower this can be done! It's not a walk in the park - it is a tough walk with lots and lots of uneven steep steps and altitude to deal with but well worth it for the breath taking views. I was concerned about the altitude before we left. I didn't take Diamox. Drink plenty (lots & lots & lots) of water & pack some ibuprofen. Remember 2 walking poles, waterproofs, bug spray, toilet roll & snacks. The porters do an \"amazing\" job - running past you on the trail with massive backpacks on, then when you arrive at camp your tent is up and a fabulous meal is awaiting. We had 3 guides in our group all of whom were very friendly, helpful and keen to share their knowledge with us. Take your camera and remember to stop for rests and take some photos of the fabulous views!

If you decide to do it - just go with it and prepare - it is incredible to walk in the steps of the Inca's and learn about their culture, create friendships with fellow hikers and enjoy the amazing views and food. The landscape changes dramatically from where you start to the end. The sites you see along the way are only accessible by foot and the respect the people have for their ancestors shows in what they do. Despite the many hikers every day there is little to no trash and all guides are helping keeping it clean. As another reviewer said - bring water (you can buy some till half way on the second day) and toilet paper (LOTS) and bug spray (min 20% deet)."

Our guide made us feel very welcome and was very knowledgeable and passionate about Macchu Picchu and the different Inca sites along the way.The hike was very enjoyable. It was challenging but the guide will go at your pace. They deal with different abilities on every tour and are prepared for anything so you're in good hands.The porters were just incredible. They would leave camp after us, we would see them running the trek and would reach the next campsite way before us where they had already set up our tents, air mattresses and were preparing lunch/dinner.There was a weight limit of 6kg for our belongings which the porters carried. This was plenty for everything you needed. We carried a small daypack with snacks, water and extra layers if needed.We hiked in September and were lucky to have really good weather. It felt much hotter than what it actually was. The guide told us it was around 16 degree Celsius but it felt more like 25, due to the strength of the sun.It only rained for us at night and on the last day when we had to get up at 3am to get to Sungate.On the 2nd night, we camped at around 3400 metres which is the highest you'll be camping at. We suggest a few extra layers for this night as it did get quite cold.We read many reviews about people getting altitude sickness. We took Diamox which most people seemed to be taking. You can get these from your GP. We didn't have any sickness.The campsites were great. Amazing views and very comfortable. The only downside of the whole trek were the toilets. We've camped in many places around the world and have never experienced toilets as horrific as these. They are of course in the middle of nowhere so don't get much attention. Plus, all the different groups use the same toilets so it's bound to get quite unpleasant...just wear a neck scarf around your mouth and nose and try to hold your breath!This is by far the best tour we have done. Gadventures and our guide went out of their way to make our experience as special as possible.The meals were amazing. I can only eat gluten free food and that's exactly what I got. I really don't know how the cooks managed to prepare all of these tasty meals.The airline had lost my partners bag and we were worrying as he had everything he needed for the hike. Gadventures went to the airport for us, picked up the bag and arranged for a taxi to drop it off at our first stop in town. What a relief and an incredible service!We actually enjoyed the hike more than Macchu Picchu itself as only 500 people are allowed on the trail per day. Most of the time, it felt as if we were the only ones there.We would recommend this tour to anyone, with a reasonable level of fitness and if you want a great service, go with Gadventures!"

            "review": "Loved all of it!. What can I share that others have not shared already...... the hike is not trivial! It's tough, it's very interesting and beautiful with varied and memorable scenery and it has stone steps! 6,000+ of them. Stone steps are so much more demanding on the body than dirt or even natural rock. You have to lift your legs higher on the way up and be more focused on your balance on the way down. In other words - not trivial. For those looking forward to the physical exercise you will not be disappointed! It's a great hike up and down! I think down was harder:)For those more keen to experience nature and be closer to history, do prepare for the physical aspect of the trail. Do not assume that general physical fitness is enough.I really enjoyed this hike. There was an added uniqueness to our experience of the trail for which I credit our tour company Andes Adventures and specifically our local guide on the trail - Abelardo Duenas. Abelardo/Andes Adventures use a private camp site for the first camp on the trail as opposed to the public camp site. This private camp site across from an Inca site called Llactapata. It was very special to have dinner and breakfast sitting right across from an actual beautiful Inca ruin. Further, on out first day, Abelardo took us to a spectacular Inca ruin slightly further away from the trail. We were there by ourselves. Barely anyone visits. Perhaps because the trip to this site is at least 6 miles (roundtrip from and back to the Inca trail) with quite a bit of upward climb to get there. But the visit is so incredibly worth it. The name of the Inca site is Kente (humming bird). It is high up on the mountain hill with incredible view towards the sacred valley."

We did the Inca Discovery trip through G Adventures, which started in Lima, flew to Cusco, spent a day in the Sacred Valley and incorporated the 4 day Inca trail and it was worth every penny!!!Our guide, Washington cannot be praised highly enough. Outstanding. We loved his stories and positive attitude.The trip was very well organised and given \"South American time\", we were surprised how everything ran on time (except the flight). The equipment provided, such as tents, etc was a high standard and was carried for us and set up each day by the porters, who did an amazing job. The food made by the chefs (Carlos) who accompanied us was unbelievable, epsecially the cake they somehow managed to make for us! I don't think I can make food that good in my own kitchen, let alone half way up a mountain.I would 100% recommend this tour provider and will be using them again!"

            "review": "A few tips I wish I knew. Many people have written about their experience, and I agree with most of them that it's a truly amazing experience. You need to be reasonably fit, and have a 'can do' mentality. I heard stories of people giving up, but even though there were certain challenging points during the hike, at no point did I even contemplate turning back, or the possibility that I may not be able to finish the trail, or enjoy it.1. Bring a walking stick - at least one. You'll get to keep your knees for a few more years. It's particularly useful for the 2nd and 3rd day. I managed to do without my stick for the last day.2. Sticks are not allowed in Machu Picchu. So tie it to your day pack or put it in your duffel bag on the last day.3. Bring insect repellent - yes bugs and mosquitoes fly that high!4. Toilets, oh toilets. They are truly the worst things on the trail. I was actually surprised to see squat toilets on the trail and I was expecting to have to dig my own hole. However, with the squat toilets, things actually turn extremely smelly and unhygienic. I don't actually know any solution to this but please just be mentally prepared. Don't drink too much at night if you don't want to go to the toilet (with head torch) in the middle of the night. But of course make sure you stay hydrated.5. Bring a headtorch. It gets dark early and you'll be grateful to have one when you need the toilet or need to find something in your tent in the middle of the night.6. You can take a shower on the 3rd night. You'll find a shower between two smelly squat toilets. If you get to base camp early, it won't be as smelly. It's very cold (glacier water, 2-3C), but you'll feel clean afterwards.6. Don't bother washing your clothes - it could rain any minute. Just hang your clothes to air.7. Take your own time. It's not a race. You'll find it difficult at least on the second day - you'll be going up 300m, then 500m, then 400m vertically, in one morning. But most people can do it.8. Once you get the second day out of the way, the rest is a breeze.9. You'll need to get up early on the last day - to queue up at the checkpoint. We got to the checkpoint at around 3.40am and there were already about 45 people ahead of us. It wasn't much of a problem though and they let people pass the checkpoint from 5.30am pretty quickly. However, it meant we didn't have a bench to sit on (I think there was around 50 bench spaces)10. How much to carry? It really depends. I was carrying less than 10% of my bodyweight and didn't feel the weight of my daypack at all - so I could have carried more. But everybody is different. Weigh your clothes (individually) before you go and bring the lightest and warmest of all.11. Although we were able to give our porter 6kg of our stuff, the sleeping bag and air mattress that we hired weighed 2.5kg and 1kg respectively, and the duffel bag itself weighed 0.5kg. So you can actually just give 2kg of your stuff to porters - use it wisely!12. Water is provided and available to fill your water bottle at each meal point so I was carrying 2L max at any one point.13. Oh and the last thing - book well in advance. We went in August and places were gone in February. There are only 500 permits each day and about 300 are taken by guides and porters."

You have a deeper understanding of the Inca because you have walked their trail and seen the ruins leading up to the Grand Finale. We used G adventures, amazing company, I would definitely recommend them. (Tip: if you have a good backpacking sleeping bag and air mattress, bring your own. It is probably lighter and better than the stuff you rent. Not to say their stuff was bad, it just was heavier - meaning you get to pack less of your own stuff to meet the weight requirement. The poles are fine and cheap to rent though.)

I would suggest for novice hikers to prepare at least two months beforehand with cardio and actual terrain hiking (especially steady ascents) if you can. Otherwise, this will not be an enjoyable trek. I had trained in advance and even then I found the element of high altitude to be a considerable hurdle. The hard work that you put in everyday is paid off over and over again.

The compensation is the fantastic aerial views and the sense of achievement one gets at the end of the trail. It is a great experience but not something you would do year after year unless you were a real hiking enthusiast. It is is a hard trek and by no means should it be tried by anyone with knee, chest or lung problems. My husband is type 1 diabetic and nobody knew what to do when his blood sugar dropped. I think this is probably Llama Travel not passing on any details to our tour guide and not having the right food for a diabetic. Be prepared for the guides lack of medical training. They only carry oxygen. The food is good but small portion size meant we were hungry nearly all of the time.

The altitude is a challenge and the hiking is also challenging on parts of the trail requiring hours of intense focus at the time. The days are long. Hiking poles should be listed as mandatory. Everyone in our group used them, including the 40 somethings. We did not find the crowds a problem on the trail and hardly saw other hikers. We did the 4 day, 3 night trek and arrived at the Sun Gate about 4 in the afternoon giving us a view of MP without tourists. A spiritual and emotional journey. The added sites along the way are very special, and the changes in environments on day 2 is an extraordinary experience. For anyone trekking this trail, the pace is everything. At times, I felt like we were going at \"Everest\" speed, very slowly, but in order to hit the waypoints as needed over the 4 days, pace experience on the guide's part makes the journey much more pleasurable."

You must have a government permit to hike it that you can get online or can get through your tour guide. A friend recommended a tour company to us that is in Cusco, Peru. We contacted them online and made all our reservations. It is called Lorenzo's Adventures. Part of our 3 night, 4 day tour included hiking on a section of the Inca Trail. The Urabamba River snakes through the valley below the Trail. The views along the trail are amazing and endless and when you don't have the views of the river below, you are going through lush jungle with avocado trees, banana trees, unusual flowers, etc. There are also monkeys! The trail itself can be rocky at times with some stone steps and then be smooth and dusty at other times. We each brought a walking stick that was very helpful in maneuvering in some parts. The elevation begins at about 9,186 ft. and we reached a high of 13,780 ft. None of us got altitude sickness but we do live at 7,000 ft. at home. We all carried our own backpacks on our guided tour but you can find tours that use porters. In Ancient days, the Inca trail was used by the Chasqui, name meaning, exchange, give and take. They would run on the trail to exchange, receive and give messages. I am in awe and felt much reverence while hiking this historical trail."

I really enjoyed seeing the local people and what life in the Andes is like. We had a fantastic guide and an amazing cook and porter team, which contributed immensely to the experience. I would say I enjoyed the hiking even more than Machu Picchu itself, because we had the trail mostly to ourselves due to the wise planning of our guide. Our guide said the oldest person he's ever taken on the trail was 74 and the youngest was 9, so if you're within that age bracket, and you like hiking, then you should do the Inca Trail!"

Not as daunting as some reviews suggest, take it steadily, and enjoy a once in a lifetime experience.I am almost 70 and had some reservations about the effort that would be required. I did quite a lot of gym work to build up strength and stamina which helped. I was reminded on several occasions of a quote at my gym \"The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in one's own self determination\" - the reward of success and all those magnificent views was well worthwhile - I will only do this once in my lifetime but I am so glad that I did it. Find your own steady pace and when you breath in just hold your breath for a very short time to absorb the oxygen rather than fast breathing - this tip was from a guide and I found it very helpful.The track is narrow in places and, if wet, can be slippery so taking time to stop and appreciate the scenery is better than doing so while walking.Key elements;- Use a good travel company - I was with 6 others using Condor Travel - excellent.- A pair of walking poles is essential, obviously good boots and spare laces. Equipment such as poles are readily available and cheap so consider buying them in Peru, as I did, and maybe just leave them there.- Sort your packing out before hand - our porters were only allowed to carry 7kg for each person, 3kg was the sleeping bag so only 4kg of your bits and pieces - you carry the rest!- you climb up 12,200 feet and down 13,200 feet, even one kg will make a big difference.- pack items in plastic bags - large reseal food bags and a couple of bin liners as the supplied bags may not be waterproof. - head torch (and ideally a hand torch) essential - camps are dark at night and the last day's trekking starts well before dawn.- ensure 2 or 3 days acclimatisation at altitude such as Cusco or the Sacred Valley.- buy a cheap light weight pillow at the market - it will give you a much better night's sleep than an old ruck sack.Reaching the Sun Gate at the end of the hike was so satisfying, there was the classic view down on to Machu Picchu as the morning cloud cleared - you do not arrive there for sunrise, that is just the name of the Gate. Then a final gentle walk down to Machu Picchu itself to begin the next stage of a great trip....."

We left Ollytantambo at 5.30 am on the train and arrived at our starting point at 6.45am. We were a group of mostly over 55 year olds hoping to walk into Machu Picchu before sunset. The track was narrow and for the first 3 hours climbed reasonably steeply. We stopped to refuel and catch breath every 30-40 mins. The walking was extremely rewarding with excellent views across the steep valleys. The vegetation was prolific and so interesting. The track although quite narrow in parts was clearly defined and never a problem. The last few hours were over a much gentler incline except for one set of steps so steep we ended up on all fours scrambling along using our fingers to gain better leverage. We were utterly delighted to all reach the Sungate and gain the classic view of the Inca ruins called Machu Picchu. This day was one of the highlights of our trip."

It is not surprising that hiking Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is on the bucket list of many people. As many have reviewed here, the view along the trail is so beautiful and rewarding. No need for me to repeat here.I just want to clarify the difficulty level of Inca trail, especially for family with kids who might be interested taking the trek but a little concerned over kids' capability. The 4-day-3-night trekking is not easy, but definitely is not as difficult as I had expected after reading so many reviews or warnings before the trip. We didn't see many kids on the trail. As a matter of fact, my two boys (10 yr and 8 yr old) were the only kids we had seen over the entire trip until we arrived at Machu Picchu on the last day. They might feel a little bit tired as we adults all do, but definitely had no particular problem to finish the trek at all. My boys are not really special - they are just normally active kids engaging travel sports at home all year around. Before taking the Inca trail, we stayed in sacred valley for 3 days to acclimate the elevation and I think this was important to make hiking Inca trail A LOT manageable than otherwise. The guide, porters, and cook from the tour company had make things so much easier. We were fed pretty well with delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner. In our backpack, we don't need to carry much heavy stuff other than water of one day's consumption.Hiking Inca trail was a great experience for everyone in our family. It was not easy, but definitely so much more rewarding."

There are plenty of ruins to see en route to Machu Picchu. Enjoy them with the help of your knowledgeable guide. Recommend South Adventure Peru Tours for a customized itinerary for a small group (read my review for more details).

From the moment we met our guide Ellio at the evening briefing we felt at ease and comfortable with what laid ahead.Picked up early the following morning we headed off to KM82 the starting point and after a good breakfast our trek began. Alpaca looked after us like royalty, our tent was fine and our hired sleeping bags and air mattresses kept us comfy and warm. Believe me you will not go hungry on this trek, the food was unbelievable with a big breakfast, lunch and dinner plus snacks, our chef Marquito continually came up with an amazing variety of meals. The friendly porters were excellent and always helpful and made us feel part of the 'Green Machine'.The trek itself was challenging and rewarding all at the same time, even when we suffered with altitude sickness the Alpaca guys nursed us back to good health quickly.The scenery, Inca sites, climbing up and down all those steps, camping above the clouds and of course Machu Picchu itself made for great memories which we will never forget. Alpaca expeditions helped make this happen. 100% recommended."

            "review": "Amazing!. The best way of visiting Machu Picchu. First: book a good company - see my review about SunGate tours.The classic trial is a 4 days 3 nights hike through the the mountains. This is a high altitude hiking so I recommend getting acclimatized to the altitude before starting- some people stayed in the Sacred Valley, however we stayed 3 days in Cusco that is higher elevation. We got a bit of altitude sickness the first couple of days but were perfect for the hike! I'm not a super fit person but I go to the gym twice a week (Cardio class and zumba), I have to say that the hike is challenging but doable. At the end of the hike every leg muscle hurts!The first day is the easy one, short (hike for about 5 hrs and not too steep) however you are still adjusting to altitude so you will feel that you get tired much faster than normal.The second day is the shortest but the steeper! you hike for about 6 hr- the first 4 hours are non stop uphill - the change in elevation is 1200m and you pass the Dead Woman Pass (4200m) then you go downhill to the camp... although downhill seems to be easier the rocky surface and steps may hurt your knees ... but the following day is worse!The third day of the hike is the longest. Although you don't go as high as the day before you have to cross two other passes the fist one is a change in elevation of 600m and the second one shorter... but after that is all downhill! these are the Inka stairs to hell : ) bring a knee brace if you have knee issues!! and if you don't bring one too! Also bring a flashlight- we got to the camp at night that day. The last day is a short easy climb to the Sun Gate and a downhill hike then to Machu Picchu.Things to consider: 1- hire a porter for the things you don't need during the day (sleeping bag, mat, change of cloths) you will still need to carry warm clothes (temperature changes from day to night a lot), a poncho and rain pants, snacks and water... 2- be sure that the company you book the trip with gives you water. Water along the trail is scarce and you have to keep hydrated. A 1.5 lt camelback was OK for me (I'm 5'4' 121 lb).3- bring great hiking boots and padded hiking socks. you will be on them all day long- try them both uphill and downhill.4- hiking poles are a must! use them all the time to give some rest to the legs. 5- there are no showers so bring baby towels.6 - bathrooms are disgusting- if you saw pictures online add the smell... I covered my nose with a bandana and tried to hold my breath - don't go to the bathroom in flipflops! I brought a freshette as recommended by several people but didn't used it- Many people preferred to go to the bushes however I think that destroys the beauty of the place ... I prefer to hold my breath...7- after your awesome hike have a massage in Aguas Calientes- you can have a 30 min massage for 10 dollars"

My (brief) thoughts on the Salkantay Trail vs. the classic 4 day Inca Trail:Salkantay Trail:This was the first of our two hikes and my favorite of the two. It's a 5 day hike through mountain passes at high altitude. This trail brought me back to the Swiss Alps, as I hiked the Haute route in July 2014. The Salkantay Mountains are awe inspiring...massive, snow capped peaks reminiscent of Mont Blanc. The trail was very sparse, even in the peak tourist season. Due to the high altitude, it got below freezing two of the nights. The air is also very thin, so expect a persistent mild headache if you only spent 1 day acclimatizing in Cusco (like we did)...Advil helps. You sea a wide variety of mountain scenery. My favorite was Humanty* Lake, be sure to hike up to it on day two (many tour companies bypass it for some odd reason). Overall, an awesome, less crowded/touristy hike. Inca TrailThis was the second hike we did. The scenery was more \"tropical meets mountain,\" very cool/different to transition to after spending time in the Salkantay. The hike itself was less strenuous than Salkantay and not as cold / oxygen deprived. Lots of cool ruins along the way. My major complaint is that the trails are pretty crowded with tourists and porters. The campsites feel almost too crowded, and the hikes almost too easy some days. Still had a blast though.If I had to pick just one, I'd probably do the Salkantay to get away from the hoards of tourists, but you can't go wrong with the Inca trail either."

Our guides were warm, informative and ever helpful. As I spent a lot of time at the back of the group, I got extra info from our guide as well as regular updates on progress. The views along the way were amazing and the Incan sites along the way beckoned you to explore them. The view of the sun creeping over the city from the Sun Gate brought tears to my eyes, made all the more significant by the effort taken to get there. I couldn't stop smiling as I walked down and explored the site.This is a once-in-a-lifetime bucket list experience which is not to be missed. Don't believe anyone who says only average fitness is required. The trek is gruelling as it's at altitude, very steep and mostly on uneven ground, stairs and Incan roads.

The one-day hike from KM 104 was challenge enough for a couple of our teens not used to the altitude, but it was worth all the climbing and the heat to see what you can't see from the train or in Machu Picchu. It also felt more like we earned our first site of Machu Picchu to come over the mountain at the sun gate. We loved this hike and would do it again, but it is not for those whose knees are weak or lungs aren't strong. To walk where Incans walked and discuss the organization of their empire and see how they managed agriculture along steep cliffsides was a great experience. Take 2 litres of water per person. We had 1.5 l per person and ran out (it was especially warm) by lunch; our lunch had more water, thankfully, to get us through the rest of the hike. You have to make it to Machu Picchu before 5:00pm to avoid missing the last bus to Aguas Calientes."

Signed up to do the 4 day Inca Trail but ended up completing it in 3 days (one of the camps were not safe to stay in) and then proceeded to continue hiking to Aguas Calientes, we ended up doing over 50km in the three days. Which for me in my early 30s and have never been to the gym or properly played any sports in the last decade was an amazing accomplishment, that said refer my Colca Canyon Trail review(felt like I was going to die). The only preparation I did was hike 16km once a week for three months with 4kg on my back, I should have done more though!I did the trail using perutreks.com and I highly recommend them. The guides were extremely friendly and helpful the food was amazing, the only problem I had was the mattress was not thick enough. I signed up for the trek alone but hiked in a group of 15 other awesome people that made me feel like one of them every step of the way.I drink ALOT of water and it was my main concern so I carried 3 liters of water but it was over-kill 2 liters is more than enough. The weather is not your friend in the Andes, in April at night its freezing! And during the day you'll start with a few layers but you'll take them off after a few minutes of trekking then out of the blue a cloud will come rushing at you and it will start pouring rain.But all in all I'd do it again! A dream come true!"

There are over 25k km of trail, but the most common is the pilgrimage trail to MP. The (speculative) history and archaeological sites along the trail are incredible and offer excellent scale to the gravity of MP. The incline ranges from flat to very steep (60*) and, while it never seemed impossible, I would not recommend hiking the trail if you're not fit. The incline is surmountable with time under normal conditions, but the altitude can make some slopes extremely challenging.Three things:1. Keep in mind that the best view might not always be in front of you.2. Take time to soak in the moment.3. Hiking poles, though not required, are very helpful and highly recommended."

If you are in reasonable shape, enjoy hiking and camping, can do a low-to-moderate difficulty climb, and have a positive attitude, you can do this. Go at your own pace and don\u2019t push yourself. Use double walking sticks. Arrive in Cusco at least 2 days before hiking the trail in order to acclimatize to the altitude, and consider taking Diamox for prophylaxis. Choose a group that will allow you to find your own pace and not pressure you to keep up with everyone else. My wife and I went as a \u201cprivate group\u201d of two. Obviously this is more expensive, but it is ideal if you can afford it. It was just the two of us, our guide, our cook, and four porters. I also recommend the 5-day rather than the more common 4-day option. That way, you arrive at Machu Picchu in the afternoon, instead of hiking for hours in the dark in order to get there at sunrise. The trail is dangerous only if you are drunk or not paying attention. Always be aware of the cliff edge when walking or taking photographs. At one campground, our toilet tent was set up close to a sheer cliff. If you had to use the facilities during the night, you needed to watch your step.The toilets were not as bad as indicated in some reviews. The flush toilets available at some campgrounds were generally clean enough, and they were much better than anything we have at state campgrounds here at home. Bring your own toilet paper.The Inca Trail experience exceeded our expectations. The Incas built this road to extend their power and to awe their subject peoples. It was a sacred pilgrimage route through the mountains, which they worshipped. They intended it to induce a mystical experience, and they succeeded. We explored several impressive archeological sites and were usually the only people there. On a clear night, we were awed by the Milky Way galaxy directly overhead, spanning the sky from one horizon to the other in the same direction as the trail. The high point of our visit to Machu Picchu was getting there on the Inca Trail."

Shame people can't pick up their waste. We picked up every lolly paper we found, and finished with two small bags full. But what took may by surprise was the number of tissues on the second and third day of walking. We saw a good 200 in three days.The third day remains my favourite, with a huge diversity of landscapes and cultural sites to immerse yourself in. Watch out for the culture shock on arrival in Machu Picchu - people everywhere, and compressed into one way routes.

Books up 6 months in advance so be prepared but if you are planning ahead it is the only way to go to Machu Picchu. Trek the actual road built by the Incans through 6/7 other Inca sites that only people on the Inca trail get to visit. Booked with G adventure so can only speak for the excellence of there guides, porters and chef who made the trip all the better. Tough hike, especially day two so give a few days to get acclimatised to the altitude. Cold at night and sometimes hot during the day. Extra charge packs for your phone come in handy. Worth the extra money and planning."

            "review": "Definitely a bucket list trip. There is a vast amount of information on the Inca Trail online, so there is no need to recite all you want and need to know. It is indeed memorable and it is as challenging as advertised. We made the trek during the last week of December, which is the rainy season. We did experience rain storms, but our temperatures were moderate and pleasant. Because it was so cloudy for so much of the trek, we missed some of the more impressive views, including looking down on Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate. I'd be inclined to avoid the rainy season were I to go again.Our outfitter was Peru Treks, and I rate them highly. Our two guides, Saul and Raul, were top notch. The same is true of our chaskis (porters) and chef. The tents were good quality, but inexplicably were too short -- I'm only 5'10\" and I couldn't stretch out full length inside our tent, which significantly hampered my ability to get a good night's sleep. Do not ignore the warnings to bring clean, crisp currency with you. Outfitters will not accept torn or creased bills.They definitely take weight limitations for the chaskis very seriously, which was good to see. Because you will have to carry everything that exceeds the 20-kilogram limit your chaski is allowed to carry for you, pack carefully and be sure to have extra space in your personal backpack. Fact is, you just don't need very much clothing -- good rain gear, good hiking shoes/boots, comfortable socks, layers for the trek, a good hat, and sandals or Crocs for camp. A full set of clothes for each day is overkill.The unheralded essentials for the trip are lots of water, walking sticks and Cipro. The water is heavy, but you can't purchase it after the halfway point of the first day; and the boiled water that you can get from your guides during the trek, which you then have to treat with iodine, tastes pretty horrible. Walking sticks (trekking poles) are an invaluable asset on the trail. I consider them a necessity. The Cipro can salvage what might otherwise be a miserable adventure. You just don't want to have severe diarrhea on a 3-day trek that is completely lacking in flush commodes and which offers precious few sit-down toilets at all. The Cipro is an inexpensive insurance policy that takes up virtually no space and can be a godsend if, heaven forbid, it is needed.As virtually everyone who has trekked the Inca Trail has told you, it is an awesome experience. The beauty of the mountains, the wildlife and flora and, of course, the Incan ruins, all make it a wonderful adventure. And the sense of accomplishment when you've completed the entire trek is more than a little gratifying. It is an experience not to be missed in one's life."

Although we acclimazed to the altitude without too much difficulty after 3 days in Cuzco, I would not recommend this trek if you are under five feet, six inches tall or out-of-shape. The irregular and high stone steps up to and down the passes are very hard on the knees so bring hiking poles. Admittedly, this was the hardest hike I have ever done as at five feet tall I had to climb one step at a time. I also hiked the Salkantay pass up to almost 16,000 feet and found it much easier than the Inca trail because there were no stone steps up. I also prefer mountain scenery and the Inca trail had more ruins to visit then mountain scenery. As a active adult and for the reasons I already mentioned. I would recommend the Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu over the Inca trail."

The first day's hike was a little more challenging than we expected and he was great about letting us dictate the pace and keeping us motivated. The first couple hours of what seems like non-stop stairs are worth the effort, first to Winay Wayna and then the awesome moment of walking through the Sun Gate and seeing Machu Picchu for the first time. Although we would have preferred to do the 4-day trek, we chose the 2-day trek because of time availability.... but I have to admit that it was pretty special to see the ruins at 5pm when they were mostly empty and a clear blue sky. If we had done the 4-day trek over the same time period, every morning was fogged in. LlamaPath was great about scheduling us, communicating with us, and flexible with our schedule upon arrival into the valley. Juan Carlos was on top of everything and a great companion for the 2 days. His guidance along the first day's walk was just as great as his guidance through the ruins on the second day. A once in a lifetime experience!"

The four-day trek creates an anticipation to the stunning beauty and accomplishments of Machu Picchu. We used Andean Treks, who provided an excellent guide who taught us so much along the way that we were educated by the time we reached the city. You pass through multiple Incan sites along the way that get more and more important as you get closer. The beauty of the surrounding mountains may be the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen (I used to backpack the Calif. Sierras).The hike here is tough. To give you an example, my wife and I (mid 50s) live active lives, but began training in October for our June hike. We could run 7 miles, bike 25 or so at pace, and I used a stair stepper 2 times during the week. My wife took Pure Barre classes to strengthen her core. We were ready, but the big climbs were still tough, with lots of stops (along with everyone else). The big climb is equivalent to spending five to six hours in one day on a stair stepper. It is worth it, but be prepared in order to enjoy it. A beautiful challenge.By the time you reach MP, you feel like you've earned it, and you have.Research and uses a reputable guide service. You can get what you pay for here, cheap can get you bad service."

            "review": "well worth the effort. Llama path did a great job on everything. The food was delicious, Juan Carlos was considerate and knowledgeable and tailored his information to our specific interests. The scenery along the entire way was spectacular. I struggled with getting enough oxygen when climbing steep inclines and he was patient and encouraging. There was warm water each evening and morning to wash your hands and face or soak your feet. They supplied boiled water each morning and at lunch. The dining tent was comfortable and the meals started with an appetizer, a soup or salad, and 3 or 4 dishes for the main meal and a dessert that were delicious. The porters set up and took down our tents daily and were amazing. It rained the third morning but was mostly dry the rest of the time. Take your ponchos. Both of us had one hiking pole and that worked well for us, I would recommend at least one, Juan Carlos had two. We brought snacks but never got around to eating them. It is challenging but worth the effort. Juan Carlos recommended hiking into Machu Pichu the third day after lunch to avoid the crowd rushing to the sun gate the next morning. We did this and arrived in Machu Picchu about 4:30 that afternoon and got great pictures without the crowds. We camped at Aguas Calientes and took the bus back up the next morning for our tour of the site. A wonderful trek!"

Sorry but taking a train to Manchester Picchu is no where the same experience as hell king through the mountains, ancient ruins, and looking down from the Sun gate . Altitude was the challenge and I am in pretty good shape. Trekking poles were a must at age 57. Peru Treks was our tour group and they were wonderful and well worth the price. Food was good but altitude took away a lot of my appetite. Bathrooms are pretty bad but you are camping just remember to bring baby wipes. Porters were great and friendly and plenty of water available. Once in a lifetime experience"

            "review": "Inca Trail with Alpaca Expeditions. I spent the winter living in the Sacred Valley. After a number of months, a friend came to visit and we did a trek on the Inca Trail. Before planning the trip I had plenty of time to chat with other travelers and meet locals, guides, and porters. In the end, I chose Alpaca and was not disappointed. Those that I met before choosing all said that Alpaca was very good to their guides and porters. That should be important to the decision of who to travel with. They were helpful and organized, knowledgeable, and friendly. The food was incredible, the guides, cooks, and porters were wonderful, and the gear was great. Unlike others groups on the trail, our porters were well equipped with quality clothes and gear, we were provided with day pack covers and ponchos which were helpful, and in our case, our group size was much smaller. To top it all off, only those with Alpaca got a hot shower the last night of our trip. Extravagant, yes, but felt great. I am used to traveling on my own, carrying my own gear, and leading my own trips. This is not how I would usually travel, but still enjoyed this for what it was. A great guided trip, with excellent company, and over the top service. The trial itself is beautiful and the ruins you see on the way incredible. Machu Picchu itself was great but very crowded. Wouldn't have been the same without having seen the trail. Our guide was Lizandro. He was from a village along the trail. We even met his parents when they came out to say hello as he passed through. His mother and a few other ladies blew by us on the trail at one point. Tough ladies."

            "review": "2D/1N Inca Trail. This was the most fantastic, beautiful hiking experience I have been on. Every minute was exciting and the memories from time spent on the trail will last a lifetime. The 2D/1N option that many companies offer is perfect if you don't have time in your itinerary for 4 days, or simply don't want to camp for 3 nights. We trekked with Llamapath and everything went flawless. Would provide the itinerary but it went exactly as promised on their website! The Incas truly were a great civilization and to gain a respect for what they accomplished, I think it is necessary to walk to paths they did and see the remote structures and magnificent construction methods they used. The scenery around every corner was amazing....the winding Urubamba river, the steep and imposing ruins of Winay Wayna, the mystic cloud forests and exposed trails cutting across the mountainsides. And to see Machu Picchu from the sun gate tops of this hike. I would not call it overly challenging, but a decent amount of physical ability is required. I would say anyone can do it with a bit of training beforehand. We personally did not train at all, but we are athletic 20-somethings.If you have any doubts, shove them aside and just DO IT! You won't regret it. It is worth the cost and the effort!"

            "review": "Spectacular!. This trail is stunningly beautiful, full of history, and a magical experience. I know that many people have written about its beauty so I thought I would provide some info that might help you if you have decided to undertake this adventure. If you are still deciding whether or not to give it a try I hope this review encourages you to do so. 1. Anyone in reasonably good shape can hike this trail. I can not stress this enough.  1. There were 15 people of varying ages, backgrounds, and physical condition in our group. Everyone finished. 2. The keys are: 1. To be in reasonably good shape. Practice hiking at home with the pack weight you will be carrying on the trail. Being in good condition will not only increase the probability that you will finish, but also that you will enjoy the experience a lot more.  2. Try to be in Cusco or at altitude for at least 3 days before starting the hike to adjust a bit to the altitude. Consider using Diamox if you think the altitude may give you problems. Talk with your doctor. If you do decide to use it test it at home for 3 days to see if you have any of the side effects.  3. Pick the pace that is right for you. Don\u2019t try to keep up with someone else. If you think the pace may be too fast for you slow down. Good companies always have a guide who walks in the back with the slowest hikers. 4. Persistence. Three people in our group had trouble on day 2. One with just the physical effort, the other two with altitude issues. All three just slowed down and kept going. All three made it to the end. 2. Distance and Vertical Elevation - Over the course of 4 days you will hike 31 miles. The trail starts at an elevation of 8450 ft. and reaches its highest point at Dead Woman\u2019s Pass (13800 ft.), but due to numerous ups and downs along the way you will actually climb a total of 8900 vertical feet. 3. How to choose a guide/agency 1. Choosing the right company can be the difference between an incredible experience that you will remember forever and a painful regret. Choose the company that is best for you. Many companies sign you up and then just contract you out to someone else. Others tend to specialize in youth groups, etc. And unfortunately many of those that are less expensive skimp on the quality of guides, equipment, food, and the treatment of their porters. I used SAS. They had a lot of experience, good reviews from clients, provided me promptly with good information and were reasonably priced. On the trail the guides, equipment, food, etc. were all excellent. Their porters were adequately equipped and treated with respect. SAS has been doing this a long time and it shows. My experience with them exceeded my expectations. Their fee (before upgrades) was $640.4. Upgrades 1. Hiring a porter \u2013 Most agencies offer the option of hiring a porter to carry a portion of your load \u2013 usually 6 or 9 kg or 13-20 lbs for a reasonable fee. 13 of the 15 people in our group chose this option and I do not think anyone regretted it. Although this hike is doable for most reasonably fit people it is still strenuous hiking at altitudes between 8000 and 14000 ft. and climbing the steep Inca stairs can get you breathing hard quickly. Also, descending the stairs can be hard on the knees. Less weight will help going both up and down. I paid $70 for a porter to carry 9kg of my gear.  2. Sleeping bags, leki poles, backpacks and other equipment can be rented from SAS if you do not have your own. Other good companies provide similar rentals and services. 5. Clothing \u2013 Mountain weather is unpredictable. Rain, wind, rapidly changing temperatures, and the strong Andean sun all can make you uncomfortable and wear you down. The key is bring clothing that you can layer. When you are climbing you are going to be hot but as soon as you stop or reach the top of a pass you can cool off rapidly. Make sure you carry the things in your pack necessary to adjust. In addition, night time temperatures can be quite cold. Consider bringing: 1. Good raincoat 2. Puff ball or thermal jacket \u2013 light to medium weight 3. Long pants that can be converted to shorts are a great option for those who heat up on climbs. (Columbia makes good ones). 4. Wool hat 5. Light gloves 6. Wide brim hat \u2013 waterproof is better (Outdoor Research makes a great one called the Seattle Sombrero). 7. Sunglasses 8. Sunscreen 6. Food \u2013 With SAS there was no need to bring any food. The food served was tasty, plentiful and varied. Chicken, pasta, steak, vegetables, soup, etc. They also provided snacks after breakfast for periods in between the meals. That being said it\u2019s a good idea to bring a few of your favorite energy bars, candy, etc. 7. Hygiene etc. 1. The toilets on the trail - Well, just have low expectations. 2. Hand wipes are an effective and simple way for keeping reasonably clean. 8. A few other things to consider bringing 1. Leki Poles \u2013 They make climbing and descending much easier. 2. Headlamp \u2013 Will keep your hands free organizing your gear in the evening or early morning. 3. Earplugs \u2013 The tents are spaced closely together.  4. Book \u2013 A great way to relax after a long day (or if you wake up at 2am). 5. Heavy duty plastic bag \u2013 To line the inside of your pack \u2013 just in case. 9. As you can tell, I highly recommend this adventure but there was one other aspect that I wanted to mention because it was something that I did not expect. For me, hiking the Inca Trail was a wonderful glimpse into Peruvian rural mountain life and culture. For the first day and a half or so you will walk by the small farms and homes of many local families. I loved watching their kids playing, seeing their animals in the field, hearing their dogs barking, smelling the aromas from their kitchens and fires, and watching the men and women go about their daily lives. The entire trip was an incredible experience that I will never forget. I hope that yours is also."

They were very personable and considerate of everyone's needs. Don't let your walking speed be an issue! Everyone meets at the same checkpoints anyway so there's absolutely no rush.The 3 nights / 4 days flew by - by the end I didn't want to say goodbye.The food is not what you'd expect on a camping expedition - it's delicious (a mix of local and western dishes like quinoa soup, chicken and rice) and you'll never go hungry. There are vegetarian options too, just let them know in advance.Don't worry about carrying litres of water - there are plenty of stalls selling bottles along the way on days 1 and 2. On day 3 and 4 where there are no shops, they boiled water for us to fill up our bottles with.There is the option to hire the services of a chasqui (porter) to carry up to 6kg of your belongings. Very few people in my group took up this option - but if you think it will help definitely add it on at the time of booking.Not only did I find Peru Treks to be cheaper than other companies - but they practice and promote the fair treatment of local workers, but also support numerous community projects. So not only did I receive superb service, it was reassuring to know that my money was going to a good place. Highly recommended!!!!!"

We came with sky-high expectations of The Inca Trail, and they were surpassed.The four day trek is rough at times: very steep, cold, wet and windy. Or boiling hot, wet and windy.But all the way through it is utterly spectacular - the views of the Andes and glaciers; the wonderfully restored Inca ruins; the microclimates and wildlife you climb up and down through as you shift altitude. It's like nowhere else on earth.It's expensive, and you can do similar treks for less. But only this one is the true Inca experience, so if you can afford the treat, it's more than worth it.For more flowery description of the Inca Trail, and info on our supplier SAS Travel, check out our blog:https://ednaventures.wordpress.com/2014/12/09/the-inca-trail-km-1-38-the-speedy-incas/"

We did a private tour because we didn't want to worry about having to go at a groups speed since we are not experienced hikers, which we ended up appreciating. Day 2 is the hardest because it is a step uphill then a steep downhill, I suggest taking some altitude sickness medication this day because it is over 13,000 feet up. Bring clothes suited for 75 degree weather, rain, and very cold weather as well. This is really the hike of a lifetime and if you have the opportunity to do it you really should, but plan ahead because they don't allow that many people on the trail every day and it books up quickly."

            "review": "Physically grueling but ultimately rewarding 4-day hike. I hiked the 4-day trek from Cusco to Machu Picchu back in 2001. If you don't hike on a regular basis, I'd highly recommend that you build up your endurance by hiking with at least a 5-lb backpack up rocky hills to prepare yourself for the demands of this trek. Thankfully the superhuman porters carry most of your load, but there's a weight limit to what they carry, so pack carefully. I brought extra layers, a hat, snacks, and water in my day pack. Pack plenty of warm clothes to layer, as sleeping overnight in a tent outdoors at high altitude is mighty chilly, even in a sleeping bag.Day 2 was especially grueling, as you approach the high point of the trek, about 4200 meters (13,860 feet). At that altitude climbing any incline is a huge challenge! I was in decent shape but still struggled to propel myself forward. Bring Diamox for altitude sickness--one person in our group didn't and had horrible altitude sickness (awful headaches, vomiting, tingly fingers and toes). Thankfully I had extra and gave her some of mine.This was the most physically demanding trek I've undertaken, but at the end I had a sense of accomplishment. Seeing Machu Picchu was also a fantastic reward. It's definitely difficult and tiring (I've heard it referred to as the Inca Trial), but if you like to challenge yourself physically, it's a gratifying experience that you'll never forget."

            "review": "It's no holiday, it's an adventure!. So, thought you'd just take a walk up a hill? Think again! This was an awesome adventure. Went with \"Xtreme Tourbulencia\" and they were Excellent!!! Guide's name was Joe and he knew his stuff! The porters were unbelievable. Camp was always ready for us and kept neat & tidy. Food was v good and the cook did all he could to cater for vegetarian & non-veg. Even made a cake for the last night to celebrate our achievement.The inca trail is HARD. It\u2019s not the physical demands necessarily, it\u2019s the fact that you will have to spend\u00a010-12hrs each day for\u00a03-4days in a row with minimal sleep and recovery time.I strongly believe that the difference between an \u201cenjoyable\u201d trek and a bad experience will be the preparation. The inca trail for us was just 4 days out of a 6 week trip, but it dominated my preparation like no other trip previously (incl Africa & India). I think the best thing we did was to get the altitude acclimatisation sorted. After this it was just down to physically challenging ourselves.\u00a0For altitude acclimatisation, a couple of days in Cuzco may not be enough. We spent about 7 days. Starting at sea level (Ica/Nazca), bus to Arequipa (2700m), then Colca, then Puno (4000m) for 2 days and train to Cuzco (3400m, 3 days). Visited Sacred Valley etc. Then did the trek. If you are reasonably fit, should be OK. Be careful of the coca tea, it is a stimulant & laxative! So keeps you awake and gives you the runs! Regarding what to take, there's plenty of info on the net, but just try and keep it simple. Essentials include a pair of worn in, water proof, hiking boots, high or low cut is a personal pref just make sure your foot doesn't slip forward in the boot, otherwise you'll end up with a bruised big toe! :) Walking sticks, especially handy for the down hill sections. Clothes for hot, cold and wet weather. Fast drying and light is what you need.During the trek, carry water (accessible while walking), snacks (comfort food like chocolate and muesli bars keep you happy!) and clothes for change in weather. Keep it as light as possible, eg: 10kgs of camera gear is not a good idea! Part of our prep work was 2-5hrs bush walking, each weekend for 6 weeks, including one session in the rain! This allowed us to test our gear and decide what really mattered the most (eg: tested the wet weather gear and decided to ditch the gortex jacket for a lighter option). Note that the porters will only carry 5-7.5 kgs and this is not available to you during the day. You therefore must carry the rest!One last tip, after the trek, we were so tired and the weather was so bad that we didn\u2019t really get to enjoy MP very much. If you want to really enjoy the sight of Macchu Picchu (tours and all) I recommend not doing your tour immediately after you finish the trek. Instead, go down to Aguas Calientes, get cleaned up, fed and rested, then go back to MP and be a tourist, not a trekker.If you like camping and hiking, you gotta do this trek! Trek is a true challenge and test of endurance. Do your research and prep work and you will be well rewarded. "

We, a group of 7(including 2 young adults and a 14 year-old), hiked the Inca Trail (Jan 1-4, 2015) with Sun Gate Tours and had a wonderful trip. We selected them based on reviews found on Trip Advisor. We are a fairly easy going family group from the USA and UK who eat most things, don\u2019t mind getting a little soggy and are not looking for 5 star accommodations.The tour company office staff did a very efficient job organizing the trip. All our questions were answered promptly and professionally. Once we arrived in Cusco the trip arrangements worked perfectly from beginning to end. Our accommodations in Cusco and Aguas Calientes were clean and comfortable, the staff friendly and there was lots of hot water.For the Inca Trail portion, Sun Gate Tours paired us with an excellent guide (Navidad) and first-rate cook (Jorge) and team of 10 porters. We ate good, fresh homemade meals three times a day and on the final morning at 4:00am the team produced a decorated birthday cake! Our guide read our group perfectly. We all walked at our own pace except on the last day when Navidad made sure we were in exactly the right spot at the right time to see MP. We hiked in the wet season so we were prepared for rain each day and it did rain but not all day. Since our return, we have recommended Sun Gate Tours to many of our friends and we will use them again."

It was the hardest thing we ever have done, we are moderately active/ In shape 30 year olds. This was our honeymoon and it was amazing.Each tour company does things differently, so keep that in mind while reading. G encourages you to pack as light as possible, porters carried all our camping gear and 6kg of our personal items in sacks provided. I would highly recommend you do not exceed this and try to carry a backpack of more stuff, we had a small camelback with water, light snacks, sunglasses and hats and this was enough (maybe 2 pounds at most we personally carried). Tents were great, we did not do the upgraded mat and slept fine. We brought our own sleeping bags that were warm as the nights got cool, other participants that used the rented sleepings bags said they were good. Food was amazing, like mind blowing, we are up on a mountain, how the heck did you do that! So ole breakfast, lunch was soup and them a protein veggies and rice. Tea time when done hiking, with light snacks, dinner was soup, then protein veggies, carbs sometimes treat. They made a birthday cake one night, and surprised us with wine one night for our honeymoon. Guides were wonderful. Evenings after dinner we could not stay up, very tired. Very early start, no need for alarm clock the guides wake us up early (5-530). No need to bring snacks, they provided snacks and meals fill you up.The hike.... Day one was started off flat and easy getting harder as the day went on. Near end you start to do stairs and uphill. Desert like fauna, some ruins and breathtaking mountain views. Ok washrooms, use them now!!!!! Day two, more of a Rainforest/ jungle feel, mostly all uphill, stairs! Great views, my favorite of all views! After our morning break we head up to Dead Woman's Pass.....GET READY!!!! This was the hardest part of the whole trip! I had to take many pauses. My husband threw up (altitude? Maybe drank too much water? Just freaks hard). The climb seemed to take forever, but we made it! My husband had tears in his eyes and was soooo very proud of himself and having down this together. Then you head down for the rest of the day! Great campsite, waterfall in background. Washrooms kinda gross so use them as soon as you get there. Showers but they are freezing. Day three: up down up down all day. Stairs and ruins... Cloud forest, very pretty, above the clouds. Mix of fauna jungle feel, small caves. At lunch we paused on top of the world, favorite spot on whole trail. Felt like we were in heaven. Campsite washrooms gross, could not use. Day four woke up at 3 so porters could back up and head home on train, so we sat in dark sitting near gate till 5. As sun rose we were allowed in and climbed for a final 45 minutes to the sun gate. Nice views, soak in you are close to the end. Sun gate was nice, for us personally not as amazing as dead woman's pass. A little climb from sun gate to Machupicchu. National geographic cover photo and then a tour of the ruins then headed back by train. Lessons: wear sunscreen even if rainy. I got a burn so bad on my neck it blistered, 2nd degree burn. DRINK water, some days I was very dehydrated. Prepare for altitude sickness, we were sick most of the hike, day one felt hungover , day 2 husband threw up. Prepare for stairs, SO MANY STAIRS!!!! When we reached Machupicchu I could hardly move, I felt like the tin man!Most amazing thing I have ever done, perfect honeymoon. Felt blessed to have been there, stop and look around often, breath it in!!!"

I have seen other tour guides explain about Machu Pichu citadel more clearly with maps and diagrams.We also booked a 4D/3N amazon forest trip with them and it could not have been worse. They totally screwed up and gave us the WORST possible trip. First, there was no plan and had totally poor execution. Then, they tagged us along with some drug addicts who claim to be volunteers.

            "review": "a Magical Experience\u2013 but definitively NOT a cake walk. I have done multi-day hikes all over the world, and the Inca Trail was on my bucket list. Although there are a million things I could talk about, I'll try and focus my comments on the big questions I had prior to the hike, and my reflections after. #1 \u2013 Condition. This hike is NOT a cake walk, and although I have been on more technical, higher altitude hikes in the past, this hike was challenging due to the stair climbing. Nothing about this hike was easy, so if you have heard that this is some kind of a non-strenuous walk in the park, that is not true, for me personally or for my observations. I witnessed several isolated incidents of people crying on the trail because it was so difficult. I've never seen this before on all the hikes I have been on. You can never anticipate the altitude, no matter what your conditioning is. So altitude can be a problem, although everyone (*everyone*) does tough it out. There is literally no going back once you start. For me the challenge was the stairs. These ancient stairs that are best described as two ordinary stair heights. Some people were able to easily breeze through thousands and thousands of stair steps, but for me they were a challenge unlike any hike I've been on. Yes doable. Easy? No. #2 \u2013 Time of Year. I don't have the freedom to plan a trip like this a year in advance. I vacation when I am able. I looked on the inca trail permit availability and the first time available was what I booked. It happened to be on verge of the dry season to the wet season. I was expecting to put up with some rain. When we arrived, everyone in our hiking group basically did the same thing: look at the weather report. The weather report basically said to expect rain the whole hike. However, we did not experience any precipitation at all during the entire hike (end of November to early December). However, the last day at Machu Picchu did rain. As I think most people would agree, the hike is a wonderful experience, and not having rain for four days made for an awesome hike. Although disappointing at the end, I was thankful that my entire hike was not in the rain. It was a fair trade off ;-). Our hiking guide told us that the prior hike was rain every single day. I could NOT imagine how the hike would have been deluged in rain. This leads me to my point: If you are like me and cannot plan travel much in advance, take what you can get, even if it is in the rainy season. But if you have a choice, take the dry season. Interestingly, Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, so December is actually summer and the start of the rainy season. However, I was told that the Winter (July, say) is actually hotter because there is no cloud coverage and you get baked. I can believe this. When you are hiking, if you go under a cloud, it gets slightly chilly, but when the sun comes out it warms you up. At the high elevation, the sun can cook you. After the Inca Trail, we went on to Lake Titicaca, and since we were out early in the morning, and inside a boat most of the time, I did not think I needed sun block. I got fried like I never have before. The best protection is just to stay covered in a hat and long sleeves (even though it can get hot). #2A \u2013 When is it greenest? Have you seen pictures where everything is beautifully lush and green, and others when it's not? I was told it the scenery actually looks about the same year round. There is a moss that grows and holds in tons of water. So, even when it is dryer, it is this moss that maintains the color whether dry or rainy season. #3 \u2013 How to plan days for travel, etc. Please consider scheduling an extra day for Machu Picchu after the hike. The reason is that regardless of what time of year you travel, there is a strong chance of cloud coverage and rain on Machu Picchu. Aquas Calientes is a cute town that resembles an alpine town, but in a tropical location. When you come off Inca Trail, you will have a chance to get a tour. Let's face it, when you are off a 4 day hike, the LAST thing you want to do is hang around for a tour. It rained and poured and you couldn't take pictures because the lens would fog up. For this reason, why not schedule another trip up the following day and make a real experience of it. In my closing note, I would say that this was an extraordinary trip. As with any travel, you look back and say \"what would I do different\"? In this case, I would just have to say that I do not need to re-do my Inca Trail hike, perhaps a different hike around Machu Picchu would be lovely. But I would definitely like a return visit, which I cannot say about a lot of places I have travelled to."

My best friend and I booked the trip 4 months in advance ( which is a really good idea) and we trained for it not knowing what to expect and NOT wanting to fail ( a bit competitive) but also because this trip was about the journey for us. Planning and training is the only way to do this! You want to enjoy it not endure it. Make it part of your life for months before you go. If you find it easy because you trained then you will be able to spend your energy on enjoying the experience. The 4 day hike in is the only way ( In my opinion) to really take in the magnitude of the Machu Picchu. When you get there on day 4 you feel like you own that mountain. The people who took the bus can't get a real understanding of what it is about. We climbed Machu mountain once we got to Machu Picchu beacuase it was full of people who tok the bus up. Way too crowded considering we just spend 4 days in the mountains with the llamma's and very few people. Space issues. The climb was tough but oh so worth it. One of my favorite memories. We learned to pace ourselves which was the only way to make it. You need to be the turtle. Air is thin and lungs don't work the way they do at home. Coming down is harder on joints than going up and going up is harder on lungs. When your done you feel like you could move that mountain. The internal power it gives you (for the rest of your life) is amazing. Now it doesn't matter what faces me in my life I think 'I climbed a mountain.... This can't be that hard'. That is only one of a dozen ways it will change you. You can make some lifetime friends in 4 days.... Who knew? This is tough but I wouldn't even give a though to 'was it worth it?' It wasn't just worth it.... It was essential to my soul. I'm a more confident and better mom, wife, person and business owner with more well rounded life. DO IT!! You won't regret it!"

It's that kind of trip. \"Trip of a lifetime\" kind of trip, although that phrase can mean many things. I was a changed person when I got back.You'll see from my other reviews where to stay in Cusco to acclimate beforehand and to celebrate afterwards, where to eat and what hiking service to use (and you HAVE to use one to hike this protected area).The trail is no joke, but is doable for any fitness level, given enough time. I recommend requesting a smaller hiking group, you will get to know all of your people better. I saw some groups with as many as 40 people. In some areas it was scary, no railings or safety bits that you might expect; this is not a hike to be taken lightly, thus the requirement to be with a service. I am a hiker anyway - it is in the top five of my favorite activities in life - so to do this crown jewel of a hike was really awesome - you know how some people are \"star struck?\" (Super excited to be around celebrities?) Or \"wealth struck\", super-impressed with wealthy people? Well, I was \"hiking struck\" with this hike, and neither illness (which was severe for 36 hours before), nor weather (it was the rainy season and yeah, it rained the whole time to some degree) could dampen my enthusiasm and how geeked I was to be doing this beautiful, sacred hike. And, everyone I knew and have met ever since has been struck by it to. They even gave me a new nickname at work - Pikachu - because of doing this hike. So, all of this to say this is one COOL journey to take.This was my first true back-packing, although that's a bit of a cheat because my friend and I did take them up on the offer to pay to have a porter carry some of our things. I over-packed horribly and admired the younger, experienced back-packers who packed light, that said I do remember loaning out certain things to people who needed some things I brought. I did this hike Jan 2011 - no option for that below so I chose the latest date possible.I can't comprehend just taking the train up instead of doing the hike - I would think unless you are a serious history buff just going to Machu Picchu by train would be lame.Do it! :)"

However, I don't think I would want to see Macchu Picchu any different way unless I was physically unable. The scenery is incredible and waking up with the Andes encircling you every day is surreal. We did a four day trek at the end of December. It rained about a 1/3 of the first day, 1/2 the second day and all night and a bit the third day. We had no rain on the last day arriving to Macchu Picchu. We never felt like we were able to be warm and dry. Not the Inca Trails fault but if you are a little bit soft, like me, beware. You might not be thrilled with that, I am glad I did this at the ripe old age of 37 because the stairs are killers. Especially on the way down. Gortex jacket, pants and hiking boots are a must for this adventure! Also, having a set of fleece pants and sweater top at the end of the day to change in to was invaluable."

Small group of 7: three Brazilians (us), one American, one Paraguayan, one Spanish and one Irish, all from 25 to 35 years old. We saw some groups with teenagers and seniors in the same group, and being a physical activity may not be a very good idea. A trick is also to check if the second day is too long. It is the hardest day when you get to the highest point of the trail, so our agency planned a shorter day, so we could get some rest. That also saved us from getting soaked, since that afternoon was the single moment it rained. While we were comfortably in our tends, taking a well deserved nap, some groups faced a rough afternoon (it was raining cats and dogs!).The travel agency and its organization is also responsible for you to get get the best camping spots... Third day is the best day, with breathtaking views!! Just enjoy the ride!"

I felt so sorry for the porters that had to carry so much heavy stuff so that we could eat in a tent...so in general for our comfort. I am aware about the fact that they don't have so many possibilities to find work, but still, to see a 60 year old man with a 20kg backpack whilste I was carrying maybe 7kg doesn't feel good. Machu Picchu is a very beautiful and amazing site and I would go there again without any hesitation but on another trek, without porters. We went to some other ruins around Cusco as well for 4 days, 64km (40miles) and carried our own stuff (tent, sleeping bag, food...) and it was possible to do the trek. So maybe you wan to thing about another trek than the Inca Trail."

If you are physically fit enough to do this, then I highly suggest you do so.The views all along the trail are simply stunning, there are several inca ruins to see before Machu Picchu, and it really gives you a feeling of accomplishment to complete it. Assuming your group is good then that just adds to the fun, and it seemed like I didn't just get lucky with this as all the people who were hiking alongside us seemed like genuinely nice people.If you are on the fence of whether you can make it, you probably can. It's by no means easy, but I did see a few people who were in below average shape (of course most were in pretty good shape) who completed it. It's totally fine to go at your own pace, and you can hire a porter for a relative cheap price to carry as much as you need, which most people take advantage of.In terms of timing, I went in December which is the start of rainy season. I do think this made it not as fantastic - not because of the rain, which was about half the time, but because it was always cloudy so we missed many of the views including from the sun gate (though I'm not convinced as to why that part is so gray anyway as Machu Picchu is really far away at that point). So if you have flexibility, I suggest going during the dry season though ideally not during peak season as I'm sure it'd be really crowded and may get quite hot.As for the tour company, I used Andean Life which I recommend. The owner, William, couldn't have been nicer. Not only did he pick my wife and I up from the airport and show us around town while making sure I had the necessary equipment, but he even brought my wife to dinner with his family on Christmas Eve while I was on the trail (she didn't join me). I've never heard of someone being so nice to a complete stranger. And the trek had everything as planned with William having great communication via email prior to the trek."

The extra night and days allowed me to really enjoy the hike.We started out at KM 77 and hiked up to KM 82 (the \"official\" start) to check in at Control, and then began hiking on the slowly rising ground, along an Andean 'highway' of trekkers, donkeys, Andean ladies walking to weddings in the next town, and Incan ruins. We loved looking over the cliff to Llactapata below us, and got to explore the Huillca Racy ruin on the hill overlooking Llactapata. We continued on to a lovely lunch spot where our porters and cook had set up a dining tent by a little rushing stream, surrounded by green grass and butterflies. We hiked on through the afternoon and finished the day in a private campsite with each tent tucked inside a cozy lean-to to protect against the ever-present evening rain. The next morning we started into the national park, hiking up towards Dead Woman's Pass, which as a woman, I wish were named something else. We hiked up for a while in open country, but then entered a shady area with another little brook cheerfully running downhill while we continued upward. As we got closer to the top, the clouds crowded in so we put on our pack covers and our ponchos. The rain started hard when we were about 20 minutes below the summit, but our guide Miguel, pulled out his Andean flute and started serenading us as we trudged up the mountain in the rain. The sound of the flute over the wind seemed to transform everyone's experience from cold, wet and tired, into something magical.Once atop, we put on cozier clothes and started walking down the other side of the mountain, going down rocky and steep steps as the light stayed dim with the afternoon rain. Our warm clothes kept us from freezing as we continued to descend to our evening campsite. (Our evening campsite is where the 3-night trekkers eat lunch!) The rain let up before we arrived at our tents, and our porters brought us small buckets of warm water that we used to soak our feet. That evening, we saw the moon rise over the mountains and shine into our campsite. Beautiful!The next morning we started up again to go through the second pass, but not before going through an oval-shaped Incan ruin called Runku Racay. I started to understand that the Incans didn't have one building plan - they seemed to build according the landscape -- I wish there were more building like that today. This ruin is small, but has some lovely views. As we turned to continue upward, I noticed tiny white flowers tucked among the stones on the staircase, and Miguel started playing his flute again as the mist swirled around. Once we got to the top of the second pass, we started downward again, on the same rocky stone steps, but steps in name only, since the few of the stones are laid flush to each other. I spent a lot of time looking at stone steps while hiking up and down, and my theory is that the Incans laid the stones like that on purpose to aid drainage and give more traction. But they aren't easy, that's for sure.We kept hiking and the mist kept coming in. Before lunch we stopped at the ruin of Sayacmarca, which is a remarkable hilltop fortress. We spent about 30 minutes exploring the ruin all by ourselves. There is a stone level that shows how the Incans worked out the tilt of the walls. We could see our lunch spot from there, so finally hunger drove us off to eat lunch at Chaquicocha (Dry Lake) which is, actually, a dry lake. It was probably my least favorite spot for lunch (after some dazzling places the days before), but Sayacmarca was one of our favorite ruins.After lunch, we continue hiking to Phuyupatamarca, \"City Above the Clouds\", at about 12,100 feet. (I think this is another spot where the 3 nighters are having lunch, while we 4-nighters spent the night.) It was cold and misty when we arrived, so we didn't hike 5 minutes up the hill for the view as there was no view. It looked like everything just fell off the end of the earth into the mist. The porters found a soccer ball and played soccer (running around at 12,100!) while we organized our tents. Once evening fell, it got really cold, and the rain came in making things colder. We all bundled up, ate soup, brought everything inside the tents and went to bed right after dinner....which was perfect because we got up about 4:45 to see whether it was going to be clear for sunrise -- and it was! We bundled up again and walked up to the top of the hill in the pre-dawn gloom, and watched as the sun peeked up and lit the top of Salcantay, one of the sacred apu of the Incas. Gorgeous! The air was sparkling clean, the views went on for miles, and as we watched Salcantay get ever brighter, we saw for the first time, another Incan ruin atop the hill next to us, and saw its grey stones turned gold by the rays of the sun. And then, our porters served us tea and hot chocolate while we all watched the sun rise and glow against the mountain ranges. I was starting to think I might be Incan myself.After that glorious start to the morning, we packed up and started down the mountain, but not before visiting the actual ruins of Phuyupatamarca, the City Above the Clouds, which still has six (6) working fountains. I hadn't realized what great engineers the Incan people were until this trip -- they figured out how to grow and store lots of surplus food, figured out how to move water great distances and get water to city inhabitants, and how to connect all their cities by road. They were truly the Romans of South America. After exploring all the fountains and ruins at Phuyupatamarca, we continued onward, and downward as we needed to get from 12,100 to 7,900 --- lots of downhill. We could see the terraces of Inti Pata as we hiked and sat on one of the terraces to eat our snack and then fed the apple cores to the grazing llamas. After that, we visited the ruins of Winya Waynu, which was 10 working fountains before packing on to walk up the Incan Steps (more steps!) and then on to the Sun Gate to rendezvous with the non-hiking part of our group.We really recommend the 4 night, 5 day trip by Wilderness Travel! The trek was so fun, enjoyable, no 3:30am risings, lots of great hiking but the days weren't too long. Yes, 4 nights-5 days is more expensive, but it was so worth it for our family. I hadn't been aware there were different options of how many nights spent on the trail, and we just happened to luck out with the longer trek. Learn from my experience so you'll know before you go....!A few logistical comments - Wilderness Travel buys the permits for the trail. There are only 500 people/day allowed on the trail including support staff, so booking ahead is important. Wilderness Travel included our entry ticket for Machu Picchu for two days -- both the first day that we arrived hiking in through Inti Punku the Sun Gate, and for the second day as well, when we went in and hiked Huayna Picchu. We stayed two nights so we could return on a third morning, which involved buying tickets ourselves. Tickets CANNOT be purchased at the front entrance but only online or down in Aguas Calientes."

I wish I wore my dayhikers not my sturdy backcountry boots, it made it trickier going on the huge and narrow inca steps. I was definitely sore on the last day at machu picchu but it was amazing hike. Tips:- wear light dayhikers- Bring some coco leaves for altitude sickness and you can share these with the porters too- trekking poles, they will save your knees- pay the extra money to habe a porter carry your belongings and hike with only a daypack. I hiked carrying most of our gear and I regretted it within 3 hours into the trail cuz it's hard to keep up with those wearing a little daypack and carrying with less weight. - Tip your porters, cooks, guide and horseman well! They worked incredibly hard- For ladies, going to the bathroom was difficult on the trail since there are hardly any places to hide behind a bush so you had to go right in the middle of the trail...get a she-wee as ridiculous as it sounds and you would use it for the bathrooms in the campsite because they are the scariest/dirtiest bathrooms in the world, no exaggeration!  - spend a few days in Cusco to help acclimatize prior to the hike."

I'm Swiss and used to trekking in the mountains.Inka trail has been a very good experience but I wouldn't say it's the best hike ever.If you decide to do the Inca Trail, definitely make sure to have a few days in altitude before you get started. You want to be sure you can cope with it. If you're a reasonably fit person and used to hiking, it should be no problem for you. If you're not, you might not enjoy this hike that much. If you're not used to camping, cold or no showers for 4 days, basic toilet situation - you might find it very rough. The trail has quite a lot of steep up and downhill parts with a lot of stairs and uneven terrain. Walking poles come in handy, especially when it gets wet.The first day is quite easy, mostly flat terrain. The second day is the hardest, you have to walk up to 4200m (starting from 3000m) across the Dead Woman's Pass and back down 600m to the campsite. If you're fast, you might get there around 12pm, the slowest people from our group got there around 4pm. The third day starts with a fairly steep uphill part but it's not that long (1.5 - 2 hrs) and after it's mostly flat and downhill. The last day is an early start (around 3.30am) but there is not that much walking involved (about 2 hours including stops). Once you reach the sungate, the view of Machu Picchu makes up for the pain along the way.Even though I did it in December (start of rainy season), the weather was very good with only some rain during the first night and sporadically during the 3rd day (trail goes through the cloud forest and is often wet).I liked- great views along the way, changing scenery- good hike; not a walk in the park but definitely doable- interesting Inca sites - good and plenty of foodI disliked- toilet situation (very unclean squat toilets)- sometimes the trails were very crowded - that the porters, who had very basic equipment, had to carry so many things- price I'm glad I did it and I definitely enjoyed it but I think it's very expensive for what you get (toilets, basic campsites) and personally I prefer less crowded hikes."

Perhaps the ultimate bucket list item and an experience that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Here's a few tips and observations that will hopefully assist you in your planning:-You don't need to be in great shape to complete the hike but it helps. I trained by doing weekly hikes throughout the summer and I'm glad I did. There was one lady in our group that would fall hours behind each day, usually making it to camp after dark. She completed the trail but missed out on a lot. -My wife and I shared a pair of hiking poles. We both liked having one pole and one free hand to take pictures or drink water, etc. The poles are definitely helpful when climbing up steep inclines or maneuvering through difficult parts of the trail.-I didn't see a lot of wildlife but there are bears, foxes, bobcats and numerous other animals that live near the trail. Keep your eyes peeled!-I hired a half porter to carry some of my personal belongings and I'm glad that I did. The people in our group that didn't hire a porter really struggled at some points, especially day 2.-We lucked out and had great weather the entire time. I wore track pants and a tee shirt for most of the hike. I recommend bringing comfortable clothes, a couple guys in our group wore jeans and they did not look very comfortable. I slept in thermals and a sleeping bag which kept me very warm at night.GoToPeru did an excellent job. Our guide Paul was very knowledgeable, funny and passionate. The porters are amazing, it's incredible to watch them run up the trail with 30 kilos on their backs. On day 3 I did the \"porter challenge\" where I switched bags with a porter for 30 minutes. it was the most difficult 30 minutes of the entire hike! After lunch on day 1 we played a football (soccer) match against the guides and porters. They played the whole match without having to sub off once, their conditioning is on another level. Fun activities like this helped make the experience that much more special.Overall an amazing experience that I highly recommend to everyone."

You get a sense of the majesty of the country and the extraordinary people on this climb in a way that you never will by taking the train.

Instead of giving you play by play of the hike though (which I'm sure you will read about on many posts and blogs), I'd rather fill you in on a few things you should know before the hike.- The hike was much easier than I had expected. I did a lot of research and read how much conditioning was recommended which scared myself into thinking I might not even finish the hike. I am in my 30s, healthy and fairly active (run a couple times a week). I did not train for the trip in any way and finished each day much faster than the guide had planned.- The trail itself is like a million stone steps. It's not a dirt path. Many of the steps are very steep and being kind of short, I had to step down on most of them with both feet. The 4th morning I woke up with the worst pain in my knees for all of the hard, downhill steps. - The bathrooms at the camp sites are the absolute worst thing in the entire world!! Literally gagging just thinking about them. The smell is indescribable and there is wet toilet paper (and other unmentionable things) scattered on the ground where you stand. Because of the camp locations, you don't have any places to hide and go on the land, so it's really your only options (at least for a female). Just be warned and bring closed-toed bathroom shoes you are ok with throwing away after! - Dead woman's pass was difficult but not as scary as I had expected. I thought I would feel dizzy or sick to my stomach at the top because of the altitude but I didn't at all. NOTE: we did take a half a pill of diamox each day starting 2 days before the trip all the way until the day of dead woman's pass, so I'm sure this helped a lot. We also did not drink any alcohol until after the trip. We played it safe.- Definitely buy a large cheap poncho that covers your day pack. We booked during the 'dry season' and it poured on us the last 2 days. So be prepared for any weather.- Hiking shoes are completely OK for the hike..even in wet weather. I did wear 2 pairs of socks on the 3rd day when most of it was downhill and that helped a lot.- Don't over pack or think you can get away with more weight than allowed in the porter's bag. It's strictly regulated and they actually weigh the bags right before you start the hike. - Finally, the sites along the trail far exceeded my expectations. There were native orchid plants along the entire trail and every view was breath taking!"

You have to have a certain level of fitness and mobility to hike up and down mountains at altitudes over 14,000ft. You need to be OK with camping for 3 nights straight. You should have an appreciation for natural beauty and at least a passing interest in pre-historic ruins. It's not for everyone, but everyone on our 14-person guided trip raved about it. I'll treasure the photos and the memories. If I were to do it again, I'd save some time to visit Salinas de Maras as well.

He was very positive and encouraged us all the way. He seemed to stop at all the right places for everyone to catch their breath, which meant that we hiked as a group instead of being separated the whole hike. Many other larger groups on the trail were told by their tour guide to head off and to stop at the next meeting point. They missed all the local knowledge we gained from having a tour guide close by to ask questions and to learn about things we came across.

Did the 4 days 3 night classic Inca trail earlier this month (October), it's not a bad hike and there are lots of changes in scenery due to the microclimate in the Andes. But it is touristy, too many trekkers, you don't feel remote at all. In fact, you will constantly passing, being passed by the same people through out the hike, and you don't have much time on the trail to feel the isolation or wilderness. That been say, it is an interesting experience.Big thanks to SAS, their staffs were great when I experience breathing problem due to altitude sickness. Altitude sickness affects people differently, and coming from a coastal city it seems to affect me much more so than other people in the group, I developed High Altitude Pulmonary Edema and have symptoms resonance to an asthma attack, but SAS Travel's guides make sure my condition is stable and continually offer their support and encouragement until I finish the trail (as well as the climb to top of Huayna Picchu on the day at Machu Picchu). So sudo to the SAS Travel's guides, cooks, porters team.The biggest complaints I have with the trail beside that it has too many people, are the fact that majority of trail on day one is covered with donkey droppings, I want o nickname it the 'Donkey dropping trail'. And the available restrooms at each campsite quite horrifying from the sanitation point of view. If you google 'inca trail toilet' for some of the images people posted on their blog, you'll understand... Weather in October was not cold at all, not even at the camp site on day 2 (2 hours passed Dead Woman's Pass), except a few windy spots, T-shirts were more than suffice during the whole trek. We did got rain on day 2 after I got to camp, through out day 3 (not heavy rain), and the early morning of day 4 just before we lined up at check point. The rest of trail has been dry and sunny most of time. Overall I would give the trail 3.5 stars, the donkey droppings on the trail, the restroom condition, the amount of people on the trail took off lots of enjoyment from the hike for me :("

The porters are amazing people, the ecosystems are baffling and beautiful, the scenery is breathtaking.If you were thinking of doing the trail, you should not hesitate.The pertinents:Used AndeanAdventures. Patricia was very good about coordinating everything. They have a great reputation and Ernesto our guide was excellent. He made us feel comfortable and safe and he always waited for the slowest person if there was doubt. Our porters and cooks were great with excellent meals. It was very cold, so sometimes the hot meals turned cold quickly. My only concern was the price of pole rental. I'd say they are mandatory to have. They rent them for $25/pair. You can by them before you hit Km 82, though they are cheap, they'll def get you through. We had a group of 6 and this was, in my opinion, a perfect group. they will take 8 before requiring another guide. Another point of contention...tipping the porters, cooks and guide. we heard everything from 20 soles per porter up to 100. We ended up giving 70. We are still not sure of a proper amount. Cook and guide get more of course.We stayed at San Agustin Plaza before and after and were very pleased with our stay (see separate review).For preparation, most of use were in pretty good shape, but some needed to take more time. All in all, getting in some aerobic exercise and stairclimber should be good. We all took the diamox, but one person still really suffered from altitude sickness with nausea and vomiting, headache, though they made it through. Others had perhaps a mild headache, occas nausea. Others, no issues. The trail can get crowded, but we were happy overall. June and Oct seem best to me. We experienced rain, sun, sleet, fog. Just be prepared and bring what the tour company recommends and you'll be fine.Good luck and enjoySH"

It's camping in a simple tent, going to the bathroom in holes in the ground and unforgiving granite steps. Once you conquer day 2, Dead Woman's Pass, you will feel a sense of accomplishment that you will carry with you for the rest of your life.

They really took care of us and made sure we attacked the terrain at our own pace. Th porters made sure we were as comfortable as possible, well-fed and had warm water to help us freshen up after each grueling hike."

I can't imagine an experience being more rewarding and fulfilling than this. Extremely grateful to be able to see such astounding beauty and enjoy such a magnificent site. The hike is every bit as tough as they tell you it is, and it's hard to find even a little flat land in the 4 days. Our Intrepid guides, Bruno & Bernabe made the trip entertaining and enjoyable. The food is amazing, the accomodations (tents and sleeping mats) are excellent and the porters and chefs are truly humble and wonderful people. I heard \"Vamos, amigo!\" exlaimed several times by the porters encouraging you to carry on when you legs (or lungs) sometimes think otherwise! I've traveled many places around the world, and while I've loved almost every place I have been, there is no where in the world I would encourage others to visit, more than the Inca Trail."

The altitudes in the Andes can give even folks from Colorado a hard time. Denver is the mile high city, and Cusco is another mile higher than that.We did this trek with a company called Alpaca Expeditions, and they were fantastic in every regard. To be fair, the other companies near us (particularly Llama Path) also seemed to be doing a great job.Alpaca expeditions seemed to have the best equipped and happiest porters on the entire trail. This is important because some of the porters are so poorly equipped and miserable that if you were using their companies services for this hike, you might feel so bad for them it would ruin your whole trip. That is not the case with Alpaca Expeditions or Llama Path who get their guys real hiking gear from the US.The trail itself has views that are better than any I have seen hiking in the Rockies or the Alps. The food prepared by the cook on our expedition was absolutely wonderful. Don't take extra snacks if you go with Alpaca Expeditions. They will stuff you full of more delicious food than you can handle. Overall, this will be one of your best hiking experiences for sure. Just make sure to bring rain gear and waterproof boots."

The ups are very tough, but the rewards on getting there are awesome and all aches and pains subside in an instant. Very basic camping but slept pretty well as we were so tired! Porters and cooks do a great job - very well fed and watered throughout. Learnt much about the Inca Culture too from all the ruins and sights we saw. Feel very proud of our achievements"

            "review": "Excellent Adventure. We hiked the Inca Trail in August 2014 with the enigma travel team. I choose enigma after reading positive reviews here on TA. After talking to the I trusted them and used them to organize most of my ground arrangements for our 3 week Peru trip and on only the Inca trail, but this on another review.I planned the trip so when we arrived in Cusco we were already after Colca canyon and Titikaka Lake so the altitude was no issue. We did a few hikes on Amantani Island on Titikaka so we were ready to tackle the trail.We are a family of 5, 2 adults and 3 children from 10 to 16. We ae relatively fit and hike on an ongoing basis. While the Trail is no walk in the park, taking the altitude issue out of the equation, the Trail is not too difficult. Enigma, plan the days differently than most other agencies, making the first day long and difficult with a serious climb (over 1,300 meters ascent) and the following day also challenging although less, which leaving a comfortable 3rd and 4th day. The advantages are you meet less people on the route, and you have more time to explore the interesting sites on the 3rd day, near the sacred valley. I felt this plan was the correct way to go.The facilities were very good, we had our own sleeping bags and used enigma tents and mats, and they were spacious and well-constructed. The campsites chosen were excellent and the team always put up a small toilet tent for comfort if required.We were extremely lucky to have Fredy as our guide. We the family of 5 and the whole group the \u201cfamily\u201d of 10 felt he really upgraded this hike into a pilgrimage. His knowledge was impressive and he shared it with us in every opportunity. Fredy was teaching us about the Inka culture and life, from then till today, he was very conscious about the environment and the preservation of the trail and sites on the way. With concern to every group member, with taking care of the small details, and cleverly uniting us as a group he was really a group leader and not only a guide showing the way. Generally the whole crew, from Antony the assistant guide through the 14 porters and the cook and his assistant made a great job.To sum my recommendations: use Enigna, try for Fredy, get acclimatized for the altitude, bring a cold weather sleeping bag and trekking poles listen to your guide embrace nature and history."

Since you have already read how unique the trip is from other reviewers, I will just give a few tips/hints to help with the adventure.No matter your age or level of physical ability, you can do this hike. Seasoned hikers and people in good shape, this will be a breeze. If you go in phases of exercising like most people, you will have moments of panting, exhaustion, and soreness but you will have no problems completing the hike. Individuals who may be older or out of shape, YOU CAN DO THIS!!!, just do not hesitate to do a little training before hand (nothing serious, just start walking and doing the stair climber). You will not regret it. There have been people ages ranging from 6-87(that I am aware of) that have completed the hike. Each day has a set start and end point. Some people finish by 1, some roll in around 7:30. It is very flexible to accommodate for different types of people. And don't be shy to hire a porter so that you can focus on the hike and enjoy the views. You will be warm while hiking, and will need some longer clothing for the night, your company will tell you all about what you need to bring.Final side note, be careful with your gear(particularly fleeces). While many porters are some of the most amazing individuals you will meet in your life, there has been a history of jackets being stolen..and I think I also heard about cameras, but that happens everywhere."

This year I decided to do Inca trail with a group of friends.I contacted a several agencies trough your site.After a some emails I choose Q'ente. Huge mistake.After paying for the Inca trail they said there was no more space available. We decide to go via Salcantay with Huayna Picchu. When we arrive the agency we didn't have the Haynna Picchu tickets.The guide didn't know the program of the expedition and was no leader at all. He asked me every nigth about the program for the next day. They had good tents, but don't know how to fixed them.The food was good. The guide try to make us pay the transportation to Santa Teresa. Once again I had to show him the program so he could see that the transport was included. He just didn't new the program.When we arrived Aguas Calientes we were supposed to stay in a 3*** hotel and they put us on a hostel. The hostel was good but we payed for a Hotel.On the last day we were supposed to go by train to Poroy, very closed to Cuzco, but instead we were sent to Ollantaytambo, 3 hours by road from Cuzco, and of course, much cheaper to the agency. Finally in back in Cuzco, Mr. Joaqin, the owner of the company blaimed the guide for almost everything. That was also not nice as well because the guide tryed to excuse the company all the time.I have emails that can prove all this facts.Let me tell you that I'm a very experienced trekker and mountaineer. I'v been all over the world.Before Cuzco we have been in Arequipa with Colca Trek and everything was outstanding. The company, the guide, everything exceeded our expectations.When I return to Peru I will work with Colca Trek, but never more with Sales Qente. Never. It gives a bad name and reputation to Peru tourism."

Having done it, I would recommend anyone to prep for it and you can do it ! My group used Ancari, a really good operator and we were 24 people (quite a few in their 50's and 60's) plus 4 guides and 36 porters for 3 nights and 4 days, and we all finished it and even on day 2 we all got to camp ground before dark, I think around 6pm. Here are some tips that. I followed and was most helpful - lower body strength and balance training before trekking and also stairmaster. Get good hiking boots, poles (you can buy in Peru), liner socks (this is important to prevent blisters) and high quality, breathable, light rain gear (on day 4, it was downpour when we started), of course, light warm fleece and sleeping bag (it gets cold at night). Acclimate for 3 days after getting to Cusco, drinking lots of water, Diamax helped me (also drink mix to replenish electrolyte really helps during trekking). If you have knee problems, you need to be extra careful ... The experience itself was amazing - Ancari did an amazing job with 3 hot meals a day (delicious quinoa soup, grilled chicken, fish, beef for dinner), setting up tents, including dining tent and toilet tent. The vegetation and flora changed over the 4 day period, by day 3, we saw many Orchids and really big humming birds, it was like a rain forest !! 3-4 major Inca ruins along the way, so you learn plenty about terraces, irrigation before getting to Macchupichu This is the best and most challenging trip i ever had, but well-worth it. Be prepared and exercise, you will get an once-in-a-life-time experience and wonderful memory and friendship with fellow Trekkers!"

If any of these apply then I hope you have the ability to mentally overcome the physical challenge. If you don't then the only way off the mountain after day 2 is stretcher with the chaquis' carrying you down. I am an advid hiker and there is nothing I could have done to physically prepare for this kind of hike. Combined with the altitude, it was very hard. That being said....I MADE IT! 4 days and 3 nights! I'm 44 and in pretty good shape physically for my age. This hike was stairs, stairs, and more stairs for 4 days. Stairs up, stairs down, tall stairs, deep stairs, narrow stairs and one set of stairs so steep that I crawled up them like a ladder. But when you finally reach the sun gate and you are looking down upon Machu Picchu there is an amazing sense of accomplishment. Well worth all the pain!The views are amazing, so when you stop to catch you breath...l(which I did about every 10-15 stairs) Look around, the Andean mountains are nothing like anything I have ever experienced. Mesmerizing.I went with SAS travel Peru which was a fantastic company to travel with. I also would suggest you hire the chasqui (porter) to carry your belongings. Well well well worth the money!Acclimate by coming in 2-3 days prior to your hike. Take diamox, Carb load and you can by these can of \"Oxyshot\". I would suggest buying one an carrying it with you on the hike. Even if you don't use it someone might and better to be safe then sorry. Glad I did it. Checked off another item on the bucket list. I would definitely visit machu picchu again but hiking the Inka trail for me was not a repeatable experience."

We have NEVER been hiking, although my bf has gone camping a few times as a child. You do NOT need to be as active as us to participate in the hike. HOWEVER, if you know that you are incapable of walking briskly for more than a couple hours nonstop OR prefer more luxurious conditions- PLEASE RECONSIDER! The hike is not for the afflicted. We were struggling on Day 2 (the most difficult day) because the elevation gave us trouble breathing ON TOP OF having to climb the steepest mountain. Otherwise, there's only one way you should go to Machu Picchu. And, that is- taking the Inca Trail! Between the ruins, mountains and intricate pathways- the trail in itself is a wonder! And you appreciate Machu Picchu tenfold. We booked our 4Day Inca Trail package with SAS Travel 5 months in advance. (Check out my full length review of SAS on their Tripadvisor site). *Advice: buy EVERYTHING on the list suggested by SAS travel! We pretty much did, except for the hiking poles. We rented them through SAS for $20 each. Others rented their sleeping bags with no complaints. Bring a poncho NO MATTER WHAT! We were skeptical, as July is winter there. But, Fred told us to bring them, as we would be in the rainforest, and you never really know what kind of weather you'll get. Guess what? IT RAINED! lol Only on the 3rd day though. We had rain jackets- not good. Our bags got wet, along with our passports inside. Other travelers had ponchos that covered their bags. People wore Northface jackets in the morning, but once you start moving the jackets came off. We opted for insulated fleeces, hoodies, thermals and LAYERS! Prob the best way to keep warm. Our guides: Fred & Dimas with SAS TravelFred- laid back, SUPER intelligent, fluent English, comical, passionate, and caring. We've told EVERYONE back home how Fred has changed our lives forever, and how LUCKY we were to be blessed with such a well-rounded person. Dimas- younger, English was very elementary, but he was so eager to aid those who needed him on the trail. During our briefing the night before, Fred answered all our questions, double checked his list, made sure all questions were asked. We were late going to our start point day one. Besides human error, we, unfortunately, got a flat tire. Fred and Dimas made sure we were all taken care of. Every afternoon, at camp, they made sure everyone had a bowl of hot water and tea. They served us at lunch/dinner and made sure we all were happy and eating before they served themselves. Every night, we had a briefing for the day to come. Every morning, we were, again, given hot water and tea, breakfast served first, and that everyone was taken care of before we start the day's trekking. A few people became sick (1- cold, 1- fever). Unfortunately, we didn't get to speak to them about their experience, but it seemed as though they were taken care of well. Camp conditions: well, what can I say? You're camping lol You can't really expect luxury, but given the circumstances, our experience was ABOVE satisfactory. Tents were good, mats were good, dining was good. TOILETS- well, squat pots lol That was probably the worst of it. At every site, the stench was HORRID and the conditions were FOWL, but that is beyond the guide's and company's control, as they were public. *Advice: bring LOTS AND LOTS of baby wipes and toilet paper. And, if mother nature allows- choose a bush before the squat pots. They're probably cleaner lolFood: My bf and I are foodies. We will try anything once. We use Yelp to go to 4/5 star restaurants. And we've had all types of Hispanic/Latino food. Can I just say, the food ON OUR HIKE was THEE BEST Hispanic food I've EVER eaten in my LIFE! The chef was INCREDIBLE! Someone tell me who can bake a cake at a campsite?! WHO?! OUR CHEF! Fantastic! Mouth watering! Creative! There were 2 people allergic to dairy products AND a vegetarian. He tended to all 3 EVERY lunch and EVERY dinner. I can't say enough about him, except that I should be shamed for not remembering his name! lol Ask Irwin at the office for the cook that traveled on the July 17th 4D Inca Trail- AMAZING!Porters: The most humble, accommodating, and POWERFUL people you'll ever meet! They didn't know English, and hardly Spanish (their native language is Quechua). So, Fred had to translate a lot, but they NEVER disagreed to anything, not even to carrying a person on their back up and down a trail for hours! *Advice: Offer them coca leaves. They will forever be grateful to you.*Thank you SAS for giving us a comfortable, smooth and memorable experience in Peru! And many thanks to Fred for enlightening, educating and opening our hearts and minds to the wonders of Peru! You have given us such a blessing that we will forever be grateful for! LLAMA LOVERS!"

I did do some training (Stepmaster and long dog walks) but it was tough, but so worth it.I was incredibly nervous before and I nearly pulled out but I\u2019m so pleased I didn\u2019t. It is the best holiday and the most amazing experience. The thrill of completing was immense.We were lucky with the group, all lovely people, and the weather. Our guides, head guide Erick, ably assisted by Saul were fantastic. Erick was extremely knowledgeable about the region, giving mini tours at the sites along the trek and was a confident, supportive helpful guide, keeping everybody in good spirits. Saul held my hand, literally, down the tough bits. I couldn\u2019t have done it without these guys.The first day of the Trek is long (16KM), and we camped half way up the 1st pass. The benefits of this are you have the trail much more to yourselves and the campsites are small, almost private, meaning the facilities are not overused, and they are quiet at night.Three course meals, hot drinks delivered to the tent every morning along with hot washing water and soap and a towel. Boiled drinking water at each meal break, and daily snacks to take out on the trail. It really was luxury camping. A great chef and a great crew of portersSpend as much time as you can in the area before to acclimatise, I think this is key. We had 4 days before the trek and it made all the difference. We couldn\u2019t breathe the 1st day in Cusco but it was much better by the time we went on the trail.Also, remember to stop, look up, enjoy the view, and take a photo. Sometimes I was so focused on getting through it I had to be reminded to enjoy the trek."

The climb was tough, but the scenery was amazing and it was a once in a lifetime experience! We had porters to carry the majority of our gear and set up camp, so it was more like glamping. Thats the way to go - with the altitude carrying a daypack can get challenging. Plus the food we were served on the trail was first rate!"

            "review": "The best tour company for the Inca Trail. I actually think there are a number of good companies, and the guide is at least as important as the company. In our case, we hit the jackpot with Eco Inka and our guide Harry. The company keeps the groups small - 6 people in our case, including 3 couples from 3 different countries and spanning more than 30 years in age. Having a small group is a real plus - easier to get going in the morning, gives you a chance to get to know and bond with other people. I should note that all arrangements went fine - reservations, trail passes, pick up and drop off, paying via PayPal. One of the biggest pluses is the fact that this trek includes an extra day - you get picked up at a decent hour in Cusco and spend the day at Sacred Valley sites and end up at the company's campsite near the beginning of the Inca Trail. This campsite has hot showers and a sauna - and I advise taking advantage of this while you can! Then the next day, you begin your trek at a reasonable time of the morning instead of getting up in Cusco and having a multi-hour bus trip. The company treats its employees well, and it shows - the porters' and cooks' pride in their work was palpable. The food - wow! We had breakfast delivered to our tents on trays in the morning (when has that last happened to you?), trail snacks, lunch, tea, and dinner - always with homemade soup and entrees with lots of veggies. We had some vegetarians on the tour, and the chef made special food for them, even down to the soup broth. This is why you will not lose weight on the Trail, despite all of your exertion! The porters are amazing - pack up the tents, sleeping bags, the kitchen, the toilet tent, the food, leave after we do, get there and set up the site well before we arrive, scampering up and down the trail in flip flops. I know this is their world, but still. This company allows trekkers to go at their own pace, rather than herding people in a group, as we saw many other companies doing. This was so much better for us, as we were slower than the other 4 people and would have slowed them down considerably if they'd had to wait for us all the time. On to our guide, Harry. He is a real treasure, a native of this area, knows it like the back of his hand, including the flora, fauna, and history. He also took very good care of us, his older slow couple, even lending me his poles when it turned out the (expensive) ones I brought didn't extend to a long enough length - they were basically waist high. (They are great for local hiking but are not appropriate for steep downhill climbs such as you encounter on the IT. Make sure you check that out before plopping down $125 for foldable poles as I did.) Harry had a secret for us - rather than waking up at the crack of dawn to get to the Sun Gate before the other hordes of trekkers, he got us up at the crack of dawn to watch the sun rise at Wi\u00f1ay Wayna (\"forever young,\" named after a perennially blooming orchid that is found there). It was truly magical, just us and the ruins - oh, and a few sleepy llamas just waking up. I think all of us will hold this memory is our hearts forever. Yes, we did get to the Sun Gate after the hordes had been there, and it was socked in by fog, as it had been all morning. Harry is a special person, as I can perhaps illustrate by the fact that he said that if we were so inclined to give him a tip, he would prefer a book for his kindle. What a guy. A few tips: bring a stargazer chart if you are not familiar with the sky in the Southern Hemisphere. None of us were, and none of us knew what we were looking at, although I've got to say looking at all those stars was quite enough. Bring a paperback if you like to read, or maybe a pack of cards. There are down times in the afternoon, and the last thing I felt like doing was going for a hike before dinner. As many others have remarked, baby wipes, insect repellant, hydrocortisone (b/c you will get bitten anyway), J&J blisterpads (OMG, they are great), Gold Bond powder (no, I am not getting paid for product placement), double socks, a lantern if you have space. It is DARK in that tent. Have fun and hope you go with Harry!"

No question you should train and work on fitness before going and acclimatizing to the altitude in Cusco for several days before starting the trek is necessary. Have small change (1 sole coins) to pay for the \"Bano\" (toilet) facilities, water and snacks the first couple of days and be prepared for loads of stairs. Trekking poles are a must in our books, saved our knees! The trail is well maintained and scenery is out of this world. Pack light. If you are at all inclined for hiking this is the way to get to Macchu Picchu for sure. Very rewarding and satisfying arriving on foot bedraggled and dirty after a 3 day trek. Those arriving by bus, showered and clean miss a great adventure!"

We greatly underestimated it and although we did it, it was really hard work. The altitude does affect the breathing when you're working that hard! Early starts every morning, beautiful sites, gorgeous views, 3 course lunch and dinner, beautiful campsites and lunch spots, cold mornings, really warm afternoons, v cold nights, condors (rarely seen!), steep steps up, steep steps down, spectacular sights. We experienced highs and lows of emotions along the way but when we got to Machu Pichu, we both agreed that it was all completely worth it and we would definitely do it again. Such a sense of achievement when you get there! If you want any advice, feel free to message me. I won't put it all on here though as I'm sure there's plenty of other websites for that.

Then they suggested some ruins that were off the beaten path, literally. Camping by the river on our own one night was like a meeting with the ancient gods. The last day we reached the building before starting to head towards the Intihuatana, There we met many tourists, so our expedition was coming to an end. The last day of trekking was amazing admiring the vegetation and orchids growing out of the stones. You have to be in good physical condition to do this trail. The tours they offer are 2,3 and 4 days. It took us 6 days to complete the trail on our own, but it was wonderful having the opportunity todo it at our own pace,and being able to enjoy the trail without being rushed and being able to get off the track to find these other magical places that only locals get to see.

Use them. Tip them well. Watch them and be continuously amazed. Also bring plenty of soles. Our guide recommended 500 per person, just in case. There are items for purchase, like drinks and even cigarettes up to 12,000 feet. It'll cost you a sole to use the bathroom, and you'll be glad to pay because these are a tiny bit cleaner than elsewhere. Personally, bathroom facilities were more challenging than stairs or altitude. As for clothing in June, I wore everything from shorts and sleeveless tank to layers and a down jacket. Expect 70 degrees to freezing in June."

It's definetly a fun and beautiful hike, and once you get to Machu Picchu, you may feel tired and hungry, but you will most definetly feel satisfied. I had 3 minor operations 5 weeks before I hiked it, so I was not in the best shape, but I still made it, you can too! We (3 of my friends and I) booked the hike w/ \"Peru Treks.\" The guides, the cook, and the porters were all very friendly and worked hard. The meals were really big the first 2 days, it was almost overwhelming. Heads up, we had to buy water the first 2 days w/ this group, and the prices for water at the stops are outrageous, so just make sure you come adequetly prepared with cash, because at the end of the trek, you are going to want to tip everyone who helped you make it decently. I suggest you book at least 6 months in advance, and you MUST book in the dry season. We did (June), and the weather was pretty great. It only drizzled a little one day. I couldn't imagine hikig it in rain for four days. They say the 2nd day is the most difficult, but I actually felt best that day, and I give credit to the \"black s*it\" I chewed wraped in coca leaves, which one of our guides gave me. It gave me a lot of energy and helped me breathe. I suggest you buy some of that and chew it w/ coca leaves, when hiking. It really helps!!! Take wipes, tp, kleenex, head lmap, antibacterial hand soap, and veggie bags to throw yr tp which you should throw in a trash bin. Don't be like some nasty people and throw your poopy paper on the side of the \"toilet.\" When possible, it's better to use nature for going #1. FYI. Also, it may be helpful to higher a 1/2 porter (someone to carry bout 6 kilos of your stuff) up the mountain. With our group it was $60 for 4 days and you have to request this when you make your deposit. It may be offered later on during the trail when you are feeling exhausted, but it will be way more expensive! Shovel out the $60 if you can, unless you are an avid hiker, from a high altitude region. I could say much more, but everyone's experience is different, I just say do it! It will all be worth it in the end."

He shared so much history with us, took amazing care of me when I got altitude sickness, and always motivated the group with his positive attitude. The porters were well treated and seemed happy, and the food vastly exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, quantity AND variety! They even catered to some vegetarian and gluten free people. Don't eat too much at the highest altitude (afternoon/evening of Day 2)!!! This can make you more prone to altitude sickness, which, trust me, you do not want to get. It's like the worst case of food poisoning you can imagine, which isn't made any more pleasant by the toilets all being squatters. Bring altitude sickness pills (and take some in advance), as well as Advil and Imodium, just in case. You'll be glad you did!

You will also encounter lots of donkey dung, so watch out where you step, sometimes it's either step on dung or fall off the side. As you go up, you'll walk along with the river with the trees and flora. The first day was challenging and was a warm up for the second day. Second day was the hardest, bend after bend, the steps were endless, until we finally got up to Dead Woman's pass. After the second day, it gets easier but still challenging. As you go up in altitude, the flora changes and there will be less trees, but you'll be in the clouds and the view doesn't disappoint. You will encounter many ruins that will be missed if you took the train up to see Machu Picchu. Once you reach the Sun Gate, you will feel amazed on the view of Machu Picchu. Don't take pictures of Machu Picchu there, wait until you trek down closer and the pictures will look so amazing and surreal. And for another challenge, trek up Huayna Picchu the next morning (another 1500 steps)! Aracari was who we used to arranged the trek and they gave us an amazing guide Ruben who taught us about the Inca culture and the land. We had 12 porters and 2 chefs, bless these people because they had to carry everything and do the same trek. All 3 meals were amazing throughout the trek, they made it look gourmet, even served Peruvian wine! The camping gear was top notch. They gave us warm water for us to sponge ourselves. Drinking water wasn't a problem, the porters boiled it for us and no one got sick. I'm not going to mention the bathroom issue, it's camping...do use the porcelain toilets in the ground, which you will find on day 3 at the campsite. We went 2nd week in May and had amazing weather, it hardly rained, maybe for 5 minutes and mostly during the night. It will get cold at night, bring lots of \"hot hands\" to warm yourself up. Overall, you will hate it during the trek because it will be hard (at least for me, lots of moaning and groaning), but will feel great afterwards once you have reach your destination, you will be glad you did it!"

Being from Colorado, I am used to altitude and lots of hiking, so the trip was fairly easy for me in my early 40s. We had one gentleman in our group from LA who got Altitude Sickness when he arrived in Cusco and ended up having to just meet us at MP via train. The tour we took was your basic 4-day trek. It is so nice to be able to travel with just a daypack with essentials you need as you hike. You will definitely have weather/temperature changes, so you will need to pack a waterproof jacket, rain poncho, hiking poles, hat/gloves, etc. Because we were there in their Fall, we did experience torrential rain our last night. Getting up and hiking in the pouring rain in the dark to the Sun Gate wasn't great, but it was amazing when we got to MP and the sun finally came out. The tours are well organized and the food they serve is great considering the primitive conditions the cooks have to work in. If you do this, make sure you have enough $$ at the end to provide a healthy tip the support staff who lug everything else you have on their backs. They work very hard for their money and deserve every penny in my opinion. Bathroom accommodations are tough to get used to, but you do what you have to do for this experience. Bring your own small role of toilet paper because these \"bathrooms\" (if you can call a hole in the ground surrounded by walls a bathroom) are PRIMITIVE at best. You won't see a real toilet until you get to Machu Picchu!We met so many wonderful trekkers like us from all over the world. You have such a sense of pride when you get to Machu Picchu and realize that 90% of the other folks you see there that day came up by train to view it and then leave. To be there at dawn's first light is an amazing thing to behold and all the sweat and effort to hike up there was well worth it."

There were only the 3 of us in our group which made it a nicer more personal experience, our Guide Santiago our guide was a great guy and was very knowledgeable and nursed as through some tough days we were supported by an excellent team of porters and a cook who were spot on and really looked after us well, they were also a friendly group of people, many thanks to all the team for making this special guys. Its hard walking, the camp sites are spectacular and walking over the high passes leaves you struggling for breath so do plenty of fitness work before hand. At the end of the fourth day after a final gruelling assent we were at the Sun Gate looking down over Mach Pichu and it was all worth while. There were a number of day trippers coming up to the Sun Gate to take in the view but we had the satisfaction of knowing that we had walked the Inca trail to get to this point, very satisfying and very proud. Shared this with my 2 sons which made it extra special. That's another one ticked of the bucket list. What next I ask myself?"

Toilet are basic on the trek, make sure you go before it gets dark. Food is excellent, we even had a birthday cake one night - somehow. Trekkers fall into two types, those who want to get there first, and others who don't mind being at the back enjoying views. The afternoon walk is more fun than the morning. Everyone sets off at the same time and it can get quite crowded, if you are slow you are constantly having to let people pass. By the afternoon the distance between people has spaced out a lot. You only need to carry the barest minimum, porters will carry upto 5kg for you. You can also hire boots and walking poles in Cusco. Dead Woman's pass is one of the hardest parts, don't get complacent because the walk downhill to the final camp is really hard on the legs too, just when you think it is all over. Best part is when all the porters clap you on arrival at each overnight stop. Finally look out for some amazing plants and birds. There are some rare orchids and being surrounded by humming birds at one of the camps was a nice surprise."

This was one of the most unforgettable and amazing experiences of my life! The scenery is gorgeous during the entire trek, and it's amazing to see and visit various Inca archaeological sites along the way. This was the best part of the trip for me - although Machu Picchu is incredible and impressive, it is rather crowded and touristy, so having these other sites all to ourselves was very cool. A HUGE shout out to Peru Treks: our guides Freddy and Pedro were fun and informative, our chef Benedicto cooked up incredible 4 course meals (the variety and quality of the food is absolutely phenomenal), and all the porters (aka chaskis) are amazing - the amount of gear they carry is insane, and they always had everything set up for us by the time we arrived at camp. Everything went smoothly with Peru Treks, from the booking process through to the return to Cusco after our trek Their website is thorough and informative, and we felt very well prepared going into our trip. Thanks to all at Peru Treks for an AMAZING experience!Finally, a bit of advice for future trekkers: the trek is tough in parts (day 2 and the beginning of day 3 have lots of uphill), so the more fit you are the more you'll enjoy it. We had never used trekking poles before but used them on this trip and thought they were helpful - there are a lot of stairs going down and it was nice to have the poles for extra stability and balance. Additionally, make sure you bring warm clothes - it can get really cold at night, especially on the 2nd night when you're sleeping at 3,600m above sea level!"

This trek has it all: Fascinating biodiversity, intriguing history and archeology, spectacular views, and a varied and challenging topography. Preparation is a must however as it can be very physically challenging especially for those who live near sea level and/or are not used to steep ascent and descents. Despite what some reviews and sites say, this should be considered a strenuous trek unless one is acclimated to high elevation's (low oxygen) and climbs up and down stairs all day. Being 60 something Florida flatlanders, we trained hard for five months. Yoga once again proved to be invaluable for balance on uneven rock steps that can be quite slippery in the rain. We are avid trekkers but if we had one training thing to do over we would have walked up and down the parking garage much, much more! The Inca loved stone stairs.Preparation also means selecting a good company, communicating regularly with them and doing additional research regarding the kind of gear you wish to bring. Weight is limited but you want to be as comfortable as possible. Temperatures can vary dramatically. We used the whole range of clothing from only our base layer to all layers including our Gortex rain suit and fleece - all in one day! We chose Llama Path. We also chose a 5d/4n private tour so we could set our own pace.We recommend Llama Path as they were fully attentive to every need. But again, invest time in preparation and research. The support your company and guide give you is, in addition to your physical condition, most important in ensuring a great experience.Finally, once you have your training plan implemented and your trekking company selected, extend your research to the history. The history of Inca, the Spanish and the contemporary Quechua culture completes the context for the adventure! And, if at all possible, save time for Cusco and especially the Sacred Valley."

I want to say \"great\" but feel compromised. Without rival, it was the hardest thing I have ever physically endured. On the way up, you think the stairs will NEVER end. Same with the way down. We went in luxurious style (Aracari Travel) - 6 of us, 10 porters, two chefs, one guide. Our packs had 5-6# - the porters carried up to 90#, wore sandals and outpaced us 4:1. Amazing people. We chewed coco leaves like there was no tomorrow AND took Diamox AND still struggled with the thin air. We pooped in makeshift pails or occasional porcelain holes in toilet areas (1 sole cost). It was primitive and nasty AND IN THE END, one heck of an awesome time. The sheer beauty of the vegetation, the cloud forest, ice capped mountains, wild flowers and the realization that people actually placed the tens of thousands of stones upon which we walked centuries ago places you in special frame of mind. Successfully completing the trek is an accomplishment that borders on the surreal. You really find out what you are made of. When done, you just cannot believe that you actually did it! AWESOME. It is very nice to be able to take the Hiram Brigham luxury train back to Cusco, too."

At least three hot meals were provided daily, along with snacks - even jello and an iced birthday cake at one point - impressive again. The equipment was spot-on sufficient for camping each evening (tents for the kitchen, dining, and sleeping; and sleeping bags and mats for those who chose not to bring their own).

Big Willy, who owns the company, and guided our trek, is fantastic. His porters are from the mountain areas, and many of them are putting their children through secondary school, which isn't the norm in the small villages in that area, as they have to send they're children to larger towns in order for them to get that education. We were very happy with our experience with Auqui Peru and would recommend this company to anyone thinking about doing treks around Cusco and the surrounding area. Be careful which company you plan your trek with - some companies don't give back to the community and don't treat their porters well. We saw some porters with no pack and just bags, blankets, etc strapped to their backs with ropes. We heard that some porters didn't have sufficient mats or blankets to sleep at night, and that sometimes they weren't fed well on the trail. They were also made to carry heavier loads than is allowable by the newer laws made to help protect the porters. However, the porters need to work to make money, so they have little choice to sign on with these companies that don't pay them well or treat them well. The \"classic\" Inca Trail is a great hike. The first day is pretty flat, and pretty easy. The second day, you climb to above 13,000 feet to Dead Woman's Pass. That is probably the hardest day with lots of stairs, but the view from the top is worth it. The third day, you hike through the cloud forest, which has a lot of trees, moss, lichens, orchids, etc. The fourth day, you wake up early, go throught the final check point, and hike a couple of hours to the Sun Gate overlooking Machu Picchu. After about 30 more minutes of hiking, you get to Machu Picchu itself, which is amazing! Each day was different scenery, which made it a great trek. There were also a lot of different ruins along the way to learn about and explore, which you won't see if you just take a train to Machu Picchu or do any of the alternative routes to Machu Piccu. I haven't been on any of the alternative routes, so I don't know what there is to see on those treks."

You don't have to go fast, just at your own pace and enjoy, enjoy!!The 4 day hike includes camping. The 2 day hike starts at KM 104 ( a jump down from the train when it stops in the middle of nowhere)! We went with Alpaca Expeditions and our guide Erlin was fantastic. We hiked for the full day at our own speed, I recommend poles for stability. We stopped many times to admire the view and eat our snacks provided. the Inca site of Winay Wayna was our lunch stop. I have never eaten lunch with such a magnificent view. The hard part was now behind us and anticipation rose for the final trek to the Sun Gate. Even the near vertical steps approaching the end of the trail were undaunting, we were nearly there! The best part of this 2 day hike is that you reach Sun Gate late afternoon when the day tourists have gone back. You can get photos without any one else in the background, and at leisure. You have the place to yourself and that is just amazing. After lots of photos we caught the bus down to the beautiful town of Aguas Calientes for a lovely meal with our guide Erlin and fellow trekkers then our overnight stay. Next morning we were there again at 6am for our guided tour of the ruins. Again we had the place to ourselves with the campers from the 4 day trek, the day trippers come later. Because we decided to stay an extra night in the town, we had all day to again marvel at this extraordinary place (normally the 2 day hike finishes at lunch time with the bus then train back). I recommend this. The weather is constantly changing high in these mountains, the clouds are always rising and moving, but overall we had beautiful weather with mostly blue sky for some memorable photos. I thoroughly recommend a visit to this beautiful, enchanting place on earth Machu Picchu, and to reach it by hiking the Inca Trail (however long it takes,) is just the best feeling. Alpaca Expeditions made this all possible with the constant advice from Bonnie and wonderful guide Erlin. Thank You"

The track is in great condition, but you walk on uneven steps of stones or stone laid paths most of the way. The first day you walk past farms and lots of animal dung on the path, but by mid morning day 2 that is behind you with many archeological sites and stunning scenery ahead. I totally recommend this walk and if you are thinking of doing it make sure you do as you won't regret it. The time went too fast on the trail and I wanted to soak it in as much as possible, even between gasping for air getting to Dead Woman's Pass, but totally worth it. You need reasonable fitness, and several days in Cusco prior to acclimatise to the altitude is a must and helps more than you think. Do heaps of step training up and down or similar but train well in advance. Walk it at your own pace and take a poncho as we found it better than just a rain jacket. We took waterproof pants and did not use them, and we didn't take gaiters or even need to. Wear good hiking boots, and take a sleeping bag liner even if your tour company provides one for the sleeping bag you hire. They say to take a tshirt for each day, but we found 2-3 is enough. Some warm thermals for sleeping are a must. We were extremely well fed, but we did take some sweets for extra energy along the way. Take a good water bottle or Camel pack as you need to keep hydrated at all times and a small supply is not enough. We did not collect water from the streams etc, our porters boiled it up each morning so we never got sick or felt ill at any time. We also took medication for altitude sickness, which we started 2 days in advance of going to altitude in Cusco. Others in our group were doing the same and none of us got altitude sickness. Catching my breath only became a big issue going uphill, otherwise going downhill or on the flat I did not notice a problem at all.This was a very special journey and I only wished we had more time in the Cusco region and Peru to take in more of its amazing Inca history. Enjoy."

I participated in this trek many years ago, but after talking to trekkers this past March (2014) in Cusco who had just returned, it seems not to have lost any of its luster. The highest pass at 14,000' is perfectly doable, just don't be in a hurry. As our guide of years ago said, \"In the Andes we do not gage treks by kilometers (distance), but by hours.\" The destination, Machu Picchu, is so worth the effort. In many areas one treks along the ancient Inca roads used formerly by their \"chasquis\" or messengers. The view from the Inti Punku, the Sun Gate, of the ruins is breathtaking and awe inspiring. As you ascend the trail towards the ruins, be sure to be looking to the left, or you may walk right past them. There is no feeling better than the one you get by having arrived at the ruins by the same route as the Incas. As you descend towards the ruins the view is constantly changing, but you never lose sight of your goal. Happy trekking!"

It goes through different ruins and sites such as the Sun-gate. Besides the historical sites, the natures are also awesome; there are many different kinds of mini orchids and other flowers/herbs/berries/etc. The trail passes different altitude so the variety of the plants is very rich.Regarding to the facility, the camp site for the first night is OK; no shower but I could borrow (hot water even!!) from the next camp place with a small price of 5 sols. There is also morden toilet in this site.The camp site of the second night, where is high up in a altitude of 3600m above sea level, there is toilets and shower but no hot water, only the cold glacier water. I took it anyway since feeling sweaty and dirty was worse than cold shower for me... It's damn freezing cold shower.The camp site of the third night, Winay Wayna (meaning \"forever young\"), has bathrooms and showers; but it was so dirty and smelly so that I couldn't take a shower....Beside all these, the hike itself is unforgetable and difficult to describe. It's defintely a MUST of a life time."

            "review": "Surpassed even my wildest dreams. Here is my thought on the Inca Trail: If you want to do it, do it. Because you totally can. Maybe you will be slow and take lots of breaks. Maybe it will be hard and your legs and lungs will hurt. Maybe you will get altitude sickness (I did), but if you want to do it, that will keep you moving forward.I hiked with Peru Treks and even though I got altitude sickness it was still the best trip of my life. Peru Treks was amazing! Everyone took good care of me while I was sick, offering to carry my backpack and making me special teas for my stomach. The porters and cooks seem well taken care of with Peru Treks. But what they do is hard, so please be kind and tip these men appropriately, they have most certainly earned it. If you can do it with Peru Treks, book with them, you won't regret it!!My tips for the Inca Trail hike: waterproof shoes are a must. We went in the dry season but you are so close to the rain forest that your odds of showers are great. You can buy bottle water along the trail on day one and two. Plan to do this so you don't have to carry so much, but know that the water will be crazy expensive - anywhere from 5-10 Soles (elsewhere in Peru I never paid more than 2). Buy or rent hiking poles. Some of those steps were as high as my waist but only 3 inches wide. Without the hiking poles, I would have been going down them on my butt. Everyone is on the hike at the same time, so you see other companies. SAS tours seemed like a good company. They had a hiker fall and injure her ankle (something my guide says only happens about two times a year, so just be careful and you can minimize this risk), but the operation to get her off the mountain seemed very safe and professional. While no one wants that to happen to them, I found it comforting to know that they were clearly prepared. Condor Travels was another company I met several times and I found them extraordinarily rude and unpleasant. While sick on day two, one of their guides snapped at me for going too slow. Not only was it dangerous to suggest that I go faster than my comfort level, I had stopped on the side to let him pass so it was also entirely unnecessary. I met him two other times and both times he was rude to our group. I can only imagine how unpleasant it would be to spend 4 days with him, especially if you are sick or slow.I will close by again saying, if you are thinking you want to hike the Inca Trail but are afraid you won't be able to. Stop worrying and sign up. Never let fear be a reason you don't do something. You can do it at your own pace and you will amaze yourself with how strong you are! I promise!"

The hike was amazing, and we were taken care of very well by our tour guides and porters. As someone who hasn't camped since I was a kid, this was a good expereince. My boyfriend is a regular camper/hiker so he considered this \"luxury camping\". The porters carry your tents and food and set them all up for you. Really all you need to bring is a sleeping bag and your clothes, everything else is provided (and you can rent the sleeping bag from them if you need to). I am fairly fit, and found the hike somewhat challenging, but definitely worht the effort. The views are just incredible. The tour guides do a great job explaining the sites a long the way, and helping you pace yourself to handle the hike. And the porters... wow, those guys are nuts, they carry so much equipment and then cook all of your meals for you. The food was fantastic for camping food, lots of good variety and they will make alternative dishes for people with dietary restrictions or sensitivities. The last morning, we got up at 3 am, lined up til 5, and then started the hike in the dark with head lamps. Such a cool experience to see Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate and then hike down. Definitely worth every penny (and more)!"

I would say my fitness is average (for a late 30s) but having been travelling for 6 weeks I felt I had lost fitness quickly. We were met by a G guide (not the one that would lead us on the trip) in our hotel in Cusco to give us a briefing. To be honest I probably got more useful information from fellow travellers I'd met in the week beforehand who had just gotten off the trail. My suggestion (if anyone from G reads this) is to give a suggested packing list for the trail. Having said that though we had a full day in Cusco after the briefing in case we needed to buy anything which was handy. Inca trail was just amazing. Day 2 (Dead Woman's Pass) was challenging but not as hard as I dreaded (though I was well acclimatised with regards to altitude having come through Bolivia). We had to camp quite some distance from the Sun Gate on Day 3 (where most groups have lunch) this meant for a long walk in the dark down precarious steps on the start of Day 4 but hey it's the Inca trail who's complaint (certainly not the porters as they RUN past you to make their train). The inca trail was the most amazing thing I've done, I loved every minute of it (even breathlessness on Dead woman's pass). I would recommend doing it with G adventures as well. They may be more expensive but you get a sense they look after their staff. All of the porters had sleeping mats/bags, decent bags (to carry our stuff in) and proper shoes (same can't be said for many companies). The food was incredible... Seriously who makes and decorates a cake on a camp oven on Day 3. We were certainly not left to starve. Keep in mind that lunch on Day 2 is quite late (after 2) because of Dead Woman's Pass - I had taken some snacks so was okay but some people really faded. The guides were amazing. Knowledgable and caring, they added to our experience and really made us feel like we weren't just another number, though the had both done it more times than they could count it did not detract from their enthusiasm and they certainly passed this onto us. Do it!!!!"

It rained a handful of times on the hike, and never enough to be a burden when walking. The views were spectacular, and fog was never too bad. We completed our tour with United Mice. Our tour guide, Milthon, was great and kept everyone engaged. The food was really good, and porters had the tents set up and food ready before we were even close to each campsite. I would not recommend going into this hike and expecting comfort. You will be in the middle of mountains with limited access to clean toilet and shower facilities. There are no heaters, and you will be camping. It gets chilly in the mountains. If you are not comfortable with using dirty squat toilets, and takinf te occasional frewzing shower (or none at all) do not do this hike. Contrary to some reviews, we did not have to carry our used toilet paper with us, as trash bags were provided at each campsite. My husband and I have run a marathon before, work out regularly, are in good shape for our early 30s, but this hike was HARD for us. Be prepared to walk straight up and straight down stone steps and your legs will be aching the entire time. BUT the experience is well worth it. Some of the things we saw on this hike on the way to Macchu Picchu were more interesting than the famous remains itself.... 360 degree views of the mountains, Inca remains of all types, and herds of llamas relaxing right by where we were camping! We have been traveling for three months now, and this hike remains a highlight of our trip."

Our guide Victor and his right hand man Ever were amazing and very patient with slower members of the group. I particularly appreciated Victor's knowledge and enthusiasm for all the sites visited, his 'history time' sessions and willingness to accommodate requests such as those of us on day 3 who wished to climb up to the Inka Walls on the peak of the 3rd pass. Campsites were good and we had a small individual one on night one and camped on top of the third pass for night three where the views were stunning. This meant an early 3am start on day four and night walking down 3000 Inka steps which added to the overall experience. The porters were always happy and did an outstanding job. Great to see they were fully equipped with uniforms, equipment and proper backpacks. This is not the case with other companies on the trail.

The uphills, particularly to the peak on day 2 and the first part of day 3, are a serious aerobic challenge. Not recommended for anyone with heart or lung issues. Everyone else, go at your pace and don't be pushed. Slow is fine. The downhill sections which are many(you will learn to hate stairs) are a muscle (quads and calves) challenge. The rock steps are uneven and, when wet, very slippery (hence the bruises). Walking sticks may help. Caution to anyone with knee issues.Medical help on the hike is generally limited to your fellow hikers. Medical evacuation unlikely (so make sure you don't/won't need it)Don't be an idiot and carry a heavy packDon't expect to get cleanExpect the dirty squat toilets (and bring toilet paper and a headlight)Admire the porters as they carry everything you don't and go really fast.Tip well (ask the tour leader for advice - under 100 soles/person in a full group)Take lots of pictures. Take the time to soak in the views. It is beautiful and certainly looks nothing like home."

We initially baulked at the price of doing the 4D3N Inca Trail and were a little intimidated by the physical challenge but it is absolutely one of the best things we have ever done. Machu Picchu is stunning but the sense of pride/achievement you feel following the Inca Trail when you arrive at the wonder of the world really makes this a once in a lifetime experience. We went with Llamapath, who we would absolutely recommend (gave them a 5star review)The toilet facilities are appalling but thats part of the experience, don't let that put you off. The setting, the sights are breath-taking. It is one of the most challenging but rewarding things I have ever done. I would recommend some form of cardiovascular training beforehand but the times given are fairly generous and include breaks. Definitely give yourself time to acclimatise to the altitude beforehand."

To be honest, seeing Macchu Picchu isn't even the highlight of this trip but it is the journey that you share with your guide, porters and companions who become your family. Whatever you do, please make sure you do your research and bring all the necessary gear. Also, it wouldn't hurt to train for it as it was super difficult for me going uphill (Dead woman's pass is no joke) and downhill (oh my calves!!)"

Our youngest was 10 and oldest 17. From start to finish Aventours took care of us completely. When we arrived in Cuzco our guide Jhon and driver were waiting for us and they got us to the hotel and gave us tips on how to acclimate to the high altitude. They had a great itinerary taking into account that we had children with us and took care to not only cater to the adults interests but also the kids. One day we were scheduled to tour MORE...Ruins- as the kids put it and the guides changed the schedule a bit to add a zoo and a llama farm! Both were incredibly interesting to the adults and delightful to the kids!On our 4th day in Cuzco we made our way to the Aventours property which is situated at the trailhead for the trail and and met our porters and had a great traditional dinner of Pachacamac-I think? It is a dinner fully cooked in the ground with hot stones, very delicious! We woke up early the next morning packed up and our porters took our duffle bags and off they went. I was worried about the altitude and my kids but aside from an initial headache and tiredness they were fine but our contacts at Aventours were clear that kids can get really sick because they move around so much so to keep them very mellow for the first few days. After that the kids were running circles around us!At every step on the trail we felt very well taken care of, we had Jhon guiding us and Marco walking behind our group so we were never alone. We made many stops for breaks and the guides really anticipated all our needs. The porters are strong, kind, funny and humble- They smiled and laughed the whole time! They touched our hearts so much that my 17 year old daughter gave them all her Christmas money as a tip!The food was another perfect touch- our chef should be cooking at a 5 star restaurant- I am a foodie and I was bowled over. Every meal is specifically made to satisfy but to also give you the energy to finish the trek.The beauty that surrounds you on this trek is incomparable and the time we spent with our kids and friends was priceless. What my husband and I saw in our kids over those days filled me with pride and happiness as they laughed, struggled and overcame a great challenge in climbing those mountains. It was a trip of a lifetime, we are so glad we chose Aventours!"

The classic Inka trail is by far the most popular hike around Cusco, and it is definitely a great and very enjoyable walk, but it is incredibly pricy and very crowded when compared to the other amazing options available.The great things about the Inka trail are the fact that you come across many Inka ruins on the first three days (none if which are nearly as impressive as Machu Picchu itself, if still quite cool) and the fact that the hike is very doable for almost anyone (excluding the overly fed and nearly dead).Yet if you are looking for impressive nature (at a third of the price for 5 days rather than 4) I would recommend the Salkantay trek (also to Machu Picchu) or the Ausangate circuit (different altogether, and requires good physical condition).That being said, the Inka trail is still an amazing hike and I enjoyed it very much (especially entering Machu Picchu from the sun gate!).If you have limited time and/or money be sure to think twice about the hike (s) you plan to do. However, I can promise you that whatever the other options are or were, you would never regret doing the Inka trail!"

We did the full Inca Trail - one day of travelling (and visiting ruins and markets etc), four days of walking and camping, with the last day of that including the return to Cusco.

It was certainly hard in places (very very high, can be slippery/rocky/steep, and rainy) but the surroundings (tropical jungle, who knew?, and Inca ruins) were just superb. Our fellow travellers were a mix of couples and singles, aged from 30-65. All good walkers (you would have to be).

I also suggest you do at least one 4-5 day moderate-difficult hike before going as this will give you an idea of what to expect and how much more fitness and strength you need. Several people turn back because of either the difficulty or inadequate preparation for the high altitude. Now, with all this preparation on our part the hike was still not easy but mostly this was due to altitude. Everyone reacts differently. We gave ourselves 5 days to acclimate (travelling by bus to la paz and the salt flats in uyuni in Bolivia, which are often at higher elevations than Cusco) and neither of us had severe issues during acclimation (only bits of lightheadedness). Some members of our group had headaches and nausea though so giving yourself 4-5 days to get used to the altitude before going is a good idea because you should get over the symptoms by then. Even when acclimated you will not be able to go as fast and you will feel it - I really struggled on day two with my breathing but if you take it slow you will be fine (part of the struggle is the mental fortitude needed to just keeping going slow despite the endless stairs). Other than day 2 though the other days are a fair bit easier if you are in good hiking shape. The trail itself is simply beautiful and even though we went in the rainy season there was a beauty in all the mist etc. If I could do it over I would have done it in the dry season though - we were lucky to see macchu picchu on the only sunny day of our trip and we missed a few gorgeous mountain views so definitely do dry season if you can!Also, we went with SAS travel - they were quite good and reliable and the food was AMAZING!! Never though I would eat that well camping. The view of macchu picchu from the heights of the sun gate on that last day is one I will never forget!!!"

I booked this trek from home, some 6 months prior to arrival and I'd recommend that you do the same as there are limited places available to visit Macchu Pichu per day. It is more expensive than with other companies but in my opinion, the price difference is worth it. Our guide (Roger) won awards for being the best tour guide in south America. He is a passionate advocate for the beliefs and traditions of the Incan people and will viciferously defend any attempt to impugn them. His family lives in a community just of the Inca Trail. Our tour lasted 4 days and 3 nights in addition to a day and night in Cuzco to acclimatise to the climate. This is essential as the risk of altitude sickness is ever-present and you will not be allowed to complete the trek if you suffer from it too severely (it can be fatal). We bought bottles of this stuff call aqua de florida (literally flower essence and alcohol) which works similarly to smelling salts and was incredible in its effectiveness in combatting the effects. The tour takes you through the most incredible scenery I've ever seen in more than a year of travelling, but this is true of all companies as the trek follows roughly the same route no matter who you go with. What was different was the pace at which we went and the places we camped. One site is reserved specifically for this company and is picturesque. The sherpas even bought us beers!Ultimately though I'd recommend this company for its guides, they and their support staff are incredible and cannot come more highly recommended."

If you are deciding between the classic Inca Trail and one of the alternative treks, choose the classic trail, and do it with Llama Path! I'm guessing if you are looking into any trail to Machu Picchu, you are interested in both natural Andean scenery and Inca ruins. All the trails have great scenery, but with the classic Inca trail you see a lot more ruins, which get more spectacular the closer you get to Machu Picchu. I have seen several guide books that recommend an alternative trek because of 'overcrowding' on the Inca Trail. My advice is to go with Llama Path on the classic Inca Trail. You will get the full experience of the beauty of the Inca Trail without seeing much of a crowd until you get to Machu Picchu itself. The reason is that Llama Path has campsites further ahead than other tour groups' sites, so you are always the first group out on the trail every day. The first two days we were half a day ahead of other groups - our lunch site was their overnight site, so even if you are a slow hiker you won't get caught up by the crowds. The 3rd night other groups catch up to Llama Path at Winay Wayna, but even there our site was closer to the day 4 checkpoint compared to most other groups. Our group was the 2nd group to get through the checkpoint and the first group to reach the Sun Gate. Seeing the fog lift at the sun gate and Machu Picchu slowly appear from the midst of the fog was a magical experience.Besides the prime campsite locations, Llama Path had great guides, amazing chefs and porters, and are well known for treating their porters well.Altogether we had an amazing Inca Trail experience. It definitely lived up to all the hype and is absolutely worth doing."

Travel a few days before doing the Inka Trail.. you have to get use to the high altitude! You'll be usually walking between 3000 and 4000 meters.. ask your dochtor what you can do in order to prevent High Altitude Sickness. I took Acetazolamide pills, which is what I usually give to my patients. BUT you have to ask YOUR docthor what's good for you.2. Sticks are REALLY useful (at least for me they were). I rented a proffesional pair for 20 us$ for the 4 days. Don't buy the aluminum sticks they all sell in the street. The guides called them \"disposable sticks\".. I bet you can guess why..3. Do it at your own rhythm.. and when you think you should \"probably stop\", you have to stop.

            "review": "Wonderful (!) if you are well prepared. There are two places for Inca Trail reviews on Trip Advisor (the other is in the location Machu Picchu, Peru). Both have lots of useful information. So you may want to check out the other one too if you are planning on doing the Inca Trail.Here is the review I posted on the other part of TA.Two important aspects can make or break your Inca trail experience: your personal preparation and the company you choose to go with.Personal prepPrepare yourself the best you can physically. Go on hikes, use your gym's summit climber or whatever possible. Give yourself time to acclimatize. We were really happy we gave ourselves a few easy days in Cusco before we headed off because it would have been even more gruelling. Bring layers, the trail passes through different climatic zones. Some parts are scorching hot, others are cold (especially at night). And then some parts are very humid. Of course, good hiking boots should be a priority. I didn't like walking poles, but most people found them essential. Have good bug spray. Hopefully, you won't need it. But when we were on the trail we got covered with the nastiest bites that took many days to stop itching and weeks to go away (we did apply bug spray). Also, the toilets along the way can look like warzones, bring hand disinfectant and moist toilet wipes to prevent getting ill. On the last day you may be able to recharge your battery at the last campsite, but it's better to bring an extra battery for all of the photos you'll be taking.Choosing a companyYou cannot individually trek the Inca trail, so you do have to go with a registered company. Booking in advance is important, but if you don't decide in time that you want to do the Inca trail, then you can still walk to Machu Picchu using other routes (Lares, Salkantay, 2D1N Inca, Jungle)Take time choosing your company. A number of companies subcontract their clients to other companies. Double check with the company you are booking with if they will actually be the ones guiding you on the trail. This helps to ensure that you get what you pay for.As porters are an essential part of the Inca trail experience, porter welfare is important. Minimum requirements have gotten stricter in recent years (e.g. max load of 25kg) but it remains a gruelling job and further improvements should be encouraged. If you are getting cut-rate prices, then the company is likely cutting corners (but it is hard to be sure if more expensive companies pay their porters more or treat them better). One thing visibly noticeable about porter welfare is their gear. This is what I saw on the trail, hopefully others can update with what they see on the trail.Xtreme Turbulencia- many porters wore sandals and the porters feet were in poor condition, some had simple trainers (running shoes), equipment looked worn out.G adventures had average equipment, track pants, some had thinly soled trainers.Llama Path and Alpaca Expeditions both had good quality gear. Alpaca porters had hats with visor and a part protecting their neck, pants that could be turned into shorts, layers for the top and good hiking boots.As my travelling companion is less of a hiker than I am, I chose a company that provided extras (porter for personal items, extra mattresses, good food, etc.) as part of their standard service to make the experience more enjoyable for him. Some companies may seem cheaper than others but they can charge more for the \"extras\" than other companies charge for having the extras in their standard package. So, price check across companies for the things that you find essential part of your experience.Tipping is a standard practice on the trail and should be mentally factored into your budget (but you don't have to do it if you get poor service). You tend to give the tip as a group on the last evening to the porters and the cook. Our company recommends that a group contributes a total amount of $20 or 60 soles for each porter and $40-50 150 soles (double) for the cook. The tip for the guide is done personally on the fourth day. They know where they can exchange money so it doesn't matter if you pay in dollars or possibly euros. A word of caution: there can be too much of a good thing. We were warned against giving too much above the standard as it can lead to recklessness and spending the whole thing before the porters return home.If you are going to combine doing the Inca trail with climbing Huayna Picchu our company claimed that they basically had to buy another whole day ticket with the Huayna Picchu supplement (152 soles ticket price but paid $65pp to the company) - so you may want to break your visit to Macchu Picchu up over two days since you're probably paying for two days anyway. Also, if your travelling companion is not a hiker, it may be wise not to push Huayna Picchu if you only have one day because there is a lot to see in Machu Picchu, Huayna Picchu is a strenuous hike and your companion might not appreciate the extra exertion after 3 days of hiking.The trail is absolutely amazing and worth doing and by taking care of your personal prep and getting a good company, then you will be able to enjoy all of splendors that unfold over the 4 day trek."

Incredible crew, super knowledgable guides, great food, great equipment. I can't say enough about these guys. The trek itself is not easy. The younger ones in our team seemed to huff and puff a bit less but anyone over 30 definitely felt the higher mountains and the altitude. Get acclimatised before you do this and any training you can do will also help a gat deal. Having said that, you'll make it either way. What you'll see on the way is breath taking and mind blowing. Just do it."

            "review": "2Day/1Night guided Inca Trail trek to Machu Picch. My girlfriend and I decided we wanted to do the 2Day/1Night guided Inca Trail trek to Machu Picchu. Our first task was to find a tour company. We contacted several companies and after careful consideration, we choose Alpaca Expeditions. They were the most helpful company answering our plethora of questions. From the beginning to end it was very well organized. They took care of everything in advance of our arrival including our special requests. Never having been to South America I was worried that things would get screwed-up with our tours. I was also very leery about sending money via Pay Pal, but had nothing to worry about with Alpaca Expeditions. They gave us a detailed explanation of our plans before we even left the US. The tour company picked us up where we were staying versus having to meet up in a different location, which was very nice.On the day of our hike to MP we were met in the lobby of our bed and breakfast by our smiling guide Herlin. He introduced himself and was patient as my girlfriend was running a few minutes behind. Herlin brought us to the van where we were greeted by our driver and the other couple on our tour. I had heard horror stories about the drivers, but ours was a very good driver. Our guide, Herlin was very knowledgeable and had great explanations of the archaeological sites and flora along the tour. There wasn\u2019t a question we could ask him that he couldn\u2019t answer. His English was very good and it was seldom I had to ask him to repeat something. Herlin made sure everyone in our group was engaged and getting what we wanted out of the trek. When Herlin sensed that our group needed a rest, he stopped and found something interesting to show and tell us. Herlin is very knowledgeable and knows how to convey his knowledge in an interesting way. Herlin provided us with snacks, a very filling lunch, and water along the way. The hike had mostly good weather until we encountered a little bit of rain, which Herlin the Magician quickly eliminated. Our team (Puma) decided to have dinner together before going back to our hotels. We enjoyed telling stories and laughing over a nice dinner until it was time to retire to our rooms. We stayed overnight in a nice hotel in Aguas Calientes and were provided with a decent breakfast in the morning before heading up to Machu Picchu for a tour. We found the room was comfortable with everything needed for a good night's sleep before a big day at Machu Picchu. The next morning we were greeted at our hotel by a smiling Herlin. He gave us an exceptional tour of Machu Picchu that started about 6am. We saw many of the most important sites and once again had great descriptions and explanations from our tour guide. He even brought us to the Inca Bridge, which is not often seen and well worth the trip. After our tour, we had quite a bit of free time before catching the train back to Cusco. We had already arranged to hike Wayna Picchu with Alpaca Expeditions after our guided tour of Machu Picchu. Herlin brought us over to the line for Wayna Picchu gave us our tickets and some very helpful tips for the climb. Before he left us, he made sure we knew where we were to meet back in Aguas Calientes before going back to the train. Even though we were tired from our hike to Machu Picchu we felt hiking Wayna Picchu is definitely worth it! The climb is a challenge even for those that didn\u2019t hike the day before. There is something about the feeling you get when you stand at the top and see how high you just climbed, let alone the beautiful views you get to see on the way up. Our trip to Machu Picchu was one of the best experiences I had while in Peru and I highly recommend to anyone considering a visit to go through Alpaca Expeditions. My girlfriend has been to Machu Picchu before, but said the 2day/1night trek was a much better experience and she has never been hiking before. It really made you appreciate the Inca\u2019s and the hike to Machu Picchu. At the end of our trip we said goodbye to Herlin, Ronaldo, Raul, and the rest of the team at Alpaca Expeditions with a big hugs..The trip was amazing and I plan to do it again in the future. I highly recommend Alpaca Expeditions and if you can request a guide ask for Herlin. He has such a passion for his work, it is infectious."

In my opinion, you don't need to do the Inca Trail to enjoy Machu Picchu; but the trail itself and the ruins and sights along it are exceptional and it is worth doing for its own sake. Also, do make a reservation to climb Huayna Picchu (also spelt Waynapicchu), the hill behind Machu Picchu, while you are there - numbers are limited to 400 a day, so you get some peace from the crowds (instructions for booking are on Peru Treks website).As for Peru Treks, even though the pre trip email correspondence wasn't encouraging (a tiny request relating to dietary requirements, which we were very abruptly, almost rudely, told couldn't be accommodated because we hadn't mentioned it when we originally booked six months beforehand! - but which was, in fact, completely accommodated by the chef while we were on the trek, to our gratitude), we had a FANTASTIC time on the trek. Thanks to the guides, cooks and porters of Peru Treks for being worth every, pristine, untorn, US dollar bill."

For the most part, the entire trail is original Inca layed stone and is hard on the feet. Be prepared to hike a total of ~24,934 vertical feet. The first and last days are the easiest, while the 3rd and 4th day are more difficult. However, the difficulty of this trek makes the experience more gratifying. Along the Inca trail you will visit numberous of ruins that most people do not get a chance to see nor learn about. Our guide was great at providing a history lesson along the way and making sure we were all healthy. Food and tent were provided. Food was good and fresh and they were very accommodating on peoples dietary preferences/allergies. I highly recommend the company we went through, \"Peruvian Sacred & Adventure. Ask for William as a tour guide. He spoke good english and was sociable. When the 4th day comes around you will love the view of Machu Pichu, knowing you had accomplished and experienced something great."

We completely loved the experience. Despite being crowded, the trail still retains a certain aura of appeal, and nothing beats the sense of accomplishment on the 4th day when one finally arrives at the Sun gate to get that first view of Machu Picchu, preferably ahead of other groups! In addition the the usual checklist, I would recommend bringing an extra change of socks, and pair of slippers during the wet seasons. Walking sticks are essential especially during the descent if it rains (day 2). A tiny bottle of air freshener would do wonders for the damp and potentially musty tents. Lastly, if time is not a problem, I would recommend staying overnight in Aguas Caliente and climbing Huayna Picchu the next day, this way one would not be rushed and have all the time \"soak\" in the whole wondrous experience of finally being in Machu Picchu. For the trek company, we chose to go with Llama Path, and we were incredibly lucky that our chief guide Casiano and cook Marcelo were totally awesome. Final note : the Llama path office staff were relatively picky about the 7kg weight allowance rule however, Casiano and crew were relatively ok as long as one does not overfill the given duffel bag."

The Premium tour promised a maximum group size of 8, a toilet tent and self inflating mattresses. Not being young backpackers, it seemed like the way to go. Instead of a Premium tour we were thrown in with a standard tour group of 15, which wasn't even a Qente tour - not that anyone informed us that we were going with another company. We spent the first day wondering what was going on! Our pre- trek 'briefing' was totally appalling. The 'guide' who didn't turn out to be our guide, did not even seem to know what a Premium tour was and could not answer our questions about cancelling if our altitude sickness did not ease up. Yet Qente were very happy to take our money and have not had the curtesy to respond to our requests for an explanation, or refund of the difference between a Premium and Standard tour.Everyone else in our group had paid for a Standard tour. We did have a personal porter, but could have paid a little extra for that on top of the Standard tour rate, as others did.The large group we ended up with could not even fit in the dining tent, it was very difficult to hear the guide with so many people, and of course the above mentioned Premium inclusions were not provided. In regards to the actual trek, yes, the scenery is spectacular, but the trek was very challenging in the altitude. There are thousands of steps both up and down and you need to be prepared and fit. There were a couple of people in the group that were extremely unfit and one had to turn back on the first day, taking with her a guide. I strongly recommend that you take the train instead of hiking if you are not fit. Also be prepared to sleep in leaky tents and not shower for 4 days.We were lucky that we had a good group of people in our tour, but unfortunately this once in a lifetime experience was tainted by the appalling and unprofessional treatment by Qente. Find another company. We saw other small groups with good facilities and a toilet tent so there are definitely other professional companies to choose from."

What was unfathomable was that the parks department did not leave proper waste baskets for toilet paper disposal and used toilet paper was piled on window sills and on the last morning I encountered a toilet with a pile of paper knee high!!!! The smell was overwhelming. As this is a Unesco World Heritage site the Peruvian government should better handle waste management and cleaning the toilets. I not only encountered toilets covered with fecal matter but also saw fecal matter on the trails indicative of intestinal distress among other hikers as well. I have hiked many of the National Parks in the U.S. and have used outhouses, and primitive toilets, but never in my life have I encountered what I saw along the Inca trail."

Mulitple reasons why it is on bucket lists: the hike is the most physically challenging thing I've done - but the scenery in the middle and the end is unique to the world. Went with a group of 10 of extended family, inside a hiking group of 16. Spend quality time w people I normally see once every 2-3 years - makes the hike very rewarding. 2 in our group were 71 and 70 years old - You can do it! But not for the squemish - there are multiple areas where you need to be deliberate w your steps. But that is fine as no one on the trail is in a hurry - except the porters- and everyone goes at their own pace."

We had an awesome group and our guide was amazing!In terms of the trek, it was beautiful. Although alittle busy (your never really alone on the trek), you walk through the mountainous areas of the Sacred Valley and, up and over into the start of the Jungle where the scenery instantly changes and its amazing!My two biggest suggestions; Get yourself a walking stick!! Some in our group had two, most only had one. I think this completely depends on your preference. I had never really used one before and I was surprised at how quick my body fell into a rhythm with it. On the last day at Machu Pichu- it felt strange not to be walking with it!The second one would be the acclimatization. Most companies, including ours, only recommend coming to Cusco 2 days before the trek- I honestly don\u00b4t think this is enough! Atleast a week!!(there is so much to do anyways, you\u00b4ll never be bored!) The trek itself (being reasonably fit) isn\u00b4t \"extremely\" hard. But you are walking for up to 6-7 hours each day at 3500m+. If your body hasnt already adjusted to the attitude, your adding another strain to your body. Being hydrated is the best thing for you. Some people on our trek were taking the pills (to help with the altitude) and both of them ending up stopping because they were sick. Our bodies are built to adjust- let them! Everything that happens is worth it for the final arrival at the Sun Gate. We were lucky enough to even see a rainbow over it!(rainbows are very special in the Inca belief). It was fantastic! Absolutely beautiful."

There are an incredible number of steps (uphill and downhill) and parts of the trek are very steep (mainly on the dreaded day 2 of the 4 day trek). If you're not used to it its also tough carrying several kilos of stuff (which is necessary to keep warm on during the cold nights on the mountainsides). The altitude makes things even tougher - even very physically fit people were surprised to find themselves struggling. Personally, i don't think I could have done it in the height of summer, we were lucky it was a bit drizzly and cloudy for the first couple of days. Saying this, it is a privilege to see the accomplishments of the Incas and Machu Piccu at sunrise is particularly spectacular. The scenery was stunning over all four days and ranged from subtropical 'cloud' forest to snow-capped mountains. Be prepared to feel inadequate by the porters carrying most of their own body weight practically running the trek to get camp and dinner ready. The bathroom and showering facilities (where they exist) are basic at best and are very dirty. As for grupo forever young... we were slotted onto the Inca Trail at last minute with this group. Then they sub-let us to another group. We had issues with porters and had to wait over 2 hours at the start gate. Once though the gate we barely saw our guide and when we did, he explained nothing and barely spoke to us. On the second day after the check point he disappeared without a word. The group he left us with were lovely and the guide, porters etc pretty good but it wasn't quite what we expected.In summary, its a hard few days and not for the faint-hearted; there are much easier ways to see Machu Piccu (the other treks aren't necessarily easier but taking the train definitely is). But if you like a challenge and enjoy the outdoors, its an amazing way to see more incredible feats of engineering, ingenuity and architecture than just the main site."

While Machu Picchu is truly impressive, it is not possible to understand how incredible the Incas were without seeing a broader context. The Inca Trail with all its engineering marvels along the way, with different architectural achievements, and the impresssiveness of the trail itself, provides at least in part that context. To do the trail, one had better like camping, because it is a four or five day adventure that includes camping every night. But if you can tolerate the camping and can handle the hiking past ruin after incredible ruin, you'll be justly rewarded with Machu Picchu and a much better understanding of how it all fits together into the Inca design and schema."

Toilet facilities are basic squat toilets, but Llama Path staff cleaned them before we arrived so they weren't bad at all. The guides (Elvis and Marco) were generally really good, and gave you enough information about sights along the trail.

It was a great experience, especially experiencing the Inca culture and seeing all the different sites along the way was great and prepared you well for arriving in Machu Picchu on day 4. However, the trail is VERY crowded (500 people start the hike every day) so if you are used to hiking in wilderness, you won't get any of that experience here. Still, arriving to Machu Picchu from above through the Sun Gate early in the morning is worth the entire 4 days of hiking and camping.We went there in between of the dry and wet seasons and were relatively lucky. Out of the 4 days 2 days (including the one at Machu Picchu) were nice and sunny, but there was also a 24 hour period of heavy clouds and quite some rain in the high mountains part of the trail. That experience already gave a hint that the trail is to be hiked during dry season (or the shoulder months of Oct or April) only! We didn't really mind one day of rain, but if it would have been like that all the time (as it apparently is as of late Nov onwards) you would have not seen much more than clouds from a close distance and your wet hiking boots. But if you can do the hike during the dry season, go for it!Some parts of the trail covers high altitudes (most of the day 2 and 3 is around 4000 meters above sea level) so in case you have low hemoglobin or you have experienced altitude sickness before, consider taking necessary precautions (iron supplements a few weeks before the trip or altitude sickness prevention medication during your hike - consult your doctor) as quite a few people in our group suffered from some of these symptoms."

We were only 4, but since we are aged 50-62, we did not want to slow down the youngsters. The increased cost was so insignificant, it is not even worth mentioning - make sure to bring a good tip to the Quechua crew that carry tents and food - they are strong, helpful and need the income for their work.We acclimatised for 8 days in Boliva, around Lake Titicaca and Cusco, with no vitamin or medicines used - my experience from working at high altitudes is that natural is faster - rest, water and good food is the formula.We started the trek wih a visit to a rural area, which was a fantastic insight into rural life in Peru, but may not necessarily be for everyone, but if you grew up in the country, it is great.The first day of walking was casual, looking at sights, we had plenty of time to arrive at our first camp, good meal, rest - perfect.The second day we started early, around 7, and climbed up to the peak at 4215 m and continued down to the camp before lunch. One of our group has problems walking down, plus we had rain on this stretch, so lunch was late at 15:00, but this was still a good idea. We rested after a relatively light lunch, then had dinner at 19:00. Food was excellent - beyond belief.The third day gave us sunshine and a relaxed walk to peak 2 before decending and walking a little up/down (Inca flat), including sights and a stop for lunch, before we started om a brutal 1000 m descend to our night camp at Winay Wayna. A tough walk, we were tired, but we also saw people cry when they walked into camp. If you are not used to walking, you need to train. We all walk (outside) at least 40 mins / day, and we have done the full 775 km Camino to Santiago de Compostella; but all you need is a 25 km test with 10% of your body weight in your backpack. If you get problems - walk several trips until you feel ok.We decided to get up at 3:00 to be first in line at the gate which opens at 5:30. Perhaps a bit early, but we made it the Sun Gate in good time before sunrise. Be careful early in the morning, a tourist from another group fell off the trail, but was lucky to fall against some trees, and was saved from certain death by a tour guide.Macchu Picchu is what it is, and has plenty of reviews everywhere. Great, yes, but a lot of people - use the morning, trekkers arrive early. I visited 30 years ago, and it was a pearl, but very careful restoration work has also made it more authentic. Our guide from Cusi travel had an excellent knowledge of the history and context.Aguas Calientes, now Macchu Picchu village is an overestablished place, due to the limits on visitors to M.P., but the food and drink is excellent and very good value. The water in the thermal baths may look muddy, but it is all natural minerals, none of our group had any signs of illness of any kind during our time in Peru.This gem is going to be more expensive over time. The cost currently runs at around 1-2 days salary in the western world (Europe/North America). For this you get 1.5-2 crew per tourist, transport, excellent meals, guide and expensive park access. Excellent value and a fantastic experience.PS. Did somebody complain about the bathrooms - well what did you expect? This is an outdoor wilderness trek, people - it is not a walk from hotel to hotel. Preparation is everything"

My experience had been great with Quechuas Expeditions from the initial correspondence and planning stages until the end of the 4-day Inca Trek. All emails were promptly responded which helps when you're planning a trek that you're not sure you can do. I am female, almost 63 years old, relatively in shape, an avid skier, and worked out regularly at the gym for a year in preparation for this trip. I still had reservations about how altitude will be a big factor, a prohibiting one. My 67 year old brother accompanied me on this trip and we decided to get into Cusco a few days earlier before the trek date just to get acclimatized. Wayra helped us plan our day trips which were: Cusco city tour, Sacred Valley tour, a trip to Puno and Taquile Island (which is at 4000m altitude) and a morning trip to Maras & Moray. I think this really prepared us for the 4-day trek since I no longer had headaches after day 3. The classic 4-day Inca Trek that we chose went smoothly, many thanks to our guide, Juan. He gauged our strength and ability and made the trek enjoyable, not a task. Juan knew enough how to break up our day and never made us feel rushed to get to base camp at a certain time. Therefore as we were trekking we had the trail to ourselves to enjoy nature, and take pictures. By the way, we had signed up for a group trek but since there were only us two on that day it was like a private tour. We are also thankful to Armando, our cook, who prepared delicious meals everyday, and to all 4 of our porters who were very attentive to our well being. The trek itself is not easy, grueling on days II and III. Juan, being Quechua and a great guide, gave us insights into history, traditions and nature that we so appreciate. Machu Picchu was a bonus after the 4 days leading up to it. A sense of accomplishment is tremendous and I'm glad I did it.We reached Machu Picchu about 9am, Juan gave us a private tour of the citadel, reached Aguas Caliente before 1pm to have a leisure lunch and collect our duffel bags, walked the town and boarded the 6:45pm train to Ollantaytumbo. A private car picked us up there for a ride to Cusco, to our hotel. Smooth planning, Wayra! Thank you.....sul-bikee."

The Chasquis were the elite runners of the Empire!!Each Chasqui was assigned a certain number of miles. There were Tambos along the Q'apac Nan (Great Road) - \"Houses of rest' where they could rest while another Chasqui will take over the run and hand it over to the next and the next until they'll accomplished their purpose.The Apachetas are mound of stones that can be seen along the roads, hills sides etc. These stones were casted by the Chasquis as they went, on the way they will carry a stone for a little while before placing it believing that by doing that they will be leaving their tiredness behind. A number of small and large Apachetas can still be seen to this day. On Macusani INKA road exists a massive Apacheta.

What a guythe trail goes steadily up for the 7/8 km and has sheer drops on your right in some places, but at no point do you feel unsafe to be fair - Evan even walked on my wife's right hand side to make her feel more comfortable on occasion even though he was walking on the edge of a precipice!The walk is tiring, particularly with the heat and altitude, but it is a fantastic experience.Half way through you reach the Rainbow Temple which left more of a long lasting impression I'm me than Machu Picchu due to its serene location and fantastic views and no tourists - what an experience!The remainder of our journey was equally awe inspiring with jaw dropping views and tomb raider paths - but you'll love it - we even had a frog chorus when the rain started :0)The culmination of your trek takes you up the stairway to heaven (my term) and onto the sun gate where you have a fantastic view of Machu Picchu.this is quite challenging but hugely rewarding"

It was tough and grueling at times (especially with the altitude and steep flights of steps we had to climb up and down) but was the most memorable part of our Peru trip, even more memorable than the visit to Machu Picchu site itself!!Day-1 - depending on your camp site for that night could be anywhere from 5-7 hours hike. The trail is very well maintained and is fairly an easy climb. Day-2: Again depending on your camp site for Night-2, could be anywhere from 7-11 hour hike.. Our ended up being a 11 hour hike. We hiked up to Dead Women's pass, hiked down the valley and hiked up Runkurakay pass and then camped for the night.Day-3: This was a very short hiking day for us. We only hiked for ~5.5 hours and camped at Winay WynaDay-4: All the hiking groups typically hike only for 2 hours and get to machu picchu."

The trek is considered moderate, with the second day through Dead Woman's Pass being the hardest day. However, the ancient ruins that you visit en-route make it all worth while. Plan well in advance as the trail works on a limited government permit system limited to 500 per day, including porters, guides and trekkers."

You will feel a sense of accomplishment once complete, as if you 'earned' the right to walk the grounds of Machu Picchu. If you have a good group, and fantastic porters, that makes the hike even more enjoyable. It is an amazing adventure that I'd recommend to anyone who likes tent camping and has a daring sense of wonder about the world.Know that you should be in good shape for this. You will spend 4 hour stretches walking up stairs, so prepare yourself. You will require stamina and balance to hike the uneven trail. The bathrooms along the trail are no more than a dirty hole in the ground, and there are mosquitoes so bring a small bottle of bug spray."

The train stops and you cross a small bridge and pass control before checking out a small Incan rest house and then ascending following the valley to some farming terraces (crossing a large beautiful waterfall slightly before). The trail then joins to the Inca trail and arrives at Machu Pichu through the sun-gate.This trail was in great condition and not as dirty as the main trail we joined purely due to the lower numbers. We asked the guide what we had missed in the 3 days before joining up with the main trail. His answer was simple: \"The pain\".Some of the sights (such as the waterfall and the farming terraces) are slightly behind the main trail (you'd have to double back to see them) and as a result often missed by groups after 3 days of walking - so you get something unique when doing the 1 dayer.16 Kms and took the group 8 hours with a companion with serious knee problems."

I'm in my mid-20's, I work 40 hours a week mostly in an office environment, I study for an additional 20 hours a week and I do not, I repeat, DO NOT exercise at all. Nor did I have any training before this trail either. The trail is an unforgettable experience. I booked with peru treks for the 4 days 3 nights trail. I can't really explain to you the experience I got from this journey; however, I can tell you that you just gotta go and experience it yourself. Words itself cannot do this trail justice.Here are a few suggestions for those that are interested: 1. vibrams - aren't as difficult as everyone makes it to be2. most restrooms are 1 sol 3. drink plenty of water4. buddy system5. for the non-active - it's all about mental attitude. wake up each morning and think you're a bad a** and nobody can mess with you. rest when needed. don't push yourself too hard. listen to your body and know when it is time to rest. nobody never said it was easy. they did say however that it is worth it.6. get walking sticks. 5-10 sols a stick before you begin the trail. the less designed sticks are the cheaper ones.7. generally are no showers until the third day. some restrooms have sinks though and you can possibly wash your hair if it's short 8. get a whole lot of deet. I got 98% and barely got bitten...9. get hot cold patches as well as an instant cold compression. on the third day, there's a whole lot of downstairs walking so it's possible to roll or sprain your ankle 10. if you can, purchase hydration powder and also caffeine supplements. you'll need it to get through each day.11. bring lots of baby wipes, sunblock, of course, your camera12. most of all, bring a positive mental attitude."

Two major points contributed the successful trip:First, I prepared myself mentally and physically. During the three months prior to the trek I hit the gym 5 times a week and hiked every weekend in local mountains ranging from 7000 ft. to 12000 ft. The trek was still challenging, but not terribly difficult. In addition we arrived in Cusco 4 days early to acclimatize to the high altitude and we took altitude medicine. During the trek we had no altitude problems. Secondly, we chose a most wonderful trekking company, \u2018incatrekkers\u2019. We did lot of the internet research and found incatrekkers (incatrekkers.com), a company founded by an ex-porter named Juve. He is a truly remarkable young man who has a deep love of his land and people. He grew up in the area and is passionate about his job and people. He is not a just a guide, he is a part of the landscape, he naturally belongs there. In addition to he has a vast knowledge of Inca history, he is familiar with the local flora and fauna. He could identify all the plants along the trail. I am a bird watcher\u2019s wife and he pointed out many species to me. The porters are all locals who grew up with Juve. Juan Jose, Better, Raul, Sergio, and Jesus were all very friendly, always smiling and laughing. They are strong and work hard. Our cook, Cesar, not only cooked delicious meals, but made artful presentations. The meals looked like they were prepared in a top restaurant. Meals were served with beautifully carved vegetables, and at breakfast there were chocolate syrup flower drawings on the pancakes. He even baked a cake on our last night. During rest stops his freshly popped popcorn and hot, fried cheese poppers snacks were heavenly.Trekking with the most wonderful guide, Juve, and his people made all the difference in the world. We could have not asked for any better. It was a most delightful and beautiful experience. An experience I will never forget."

I traveled the Inca Trail with my brother in August and found the greatest fulfillment in the journey itself. Through trekking countless kilometers through the historically significant Inca Trail, one finds both a magic and wonder about the people who once walked/ran this path and built the various structures along its majestic 45 kilometers. Counterpoint to this deep wonderment of the past is the beauty of the present. Peru and her highlands are just beautiful! From her lowland plains to the cloud forests and unending mountain and valley views, one can imagine a time when Inca priests viewed their surroundings and found the majesty that we enjoy today. The greatest joy I found was the joy of being able to share this experience with my brother who trekked with me on the Inca Trail! We will never forget our experience together and no doubt will carry this experience with us for a lifetime! One last comment! Pick your travel partner well! We traveled with an exceptional outfit, LlamaPath! Ruben, our guide, and the Porters were nothing short of fantastic. We noted other teams on the trail whose porters where not as well outfitted. Do you research, focus on socially responsible outfits that take care of both the environment and their porters. I highly recommend LlamaPath and Ruben as a guide~!"

Of our entire trip to Peru, which included celebrating the Inti Raymi festival in Cusco, eating a traditional meal with the tribes of Lake Titicaca, watching Condors in the Colca Canyon and exploring the Santa Catalina Convent in Arequipa at 8am by myself, by far the most impactful and amazing was hiking the Macchu Picchu Trail. I had originally thought that the reason it would be so amazing is due to the destination. But the journey and trail was so beautiful and the wide variety of Inca ruins on the way, it was more powerful than walking into Macchu Picchu on the fourth day. I can't explain it, you just have to do it to know why. I liked the 5 day option because we camped alone most nights and rarely saw any other hikers, even during peak season. I also liked that our long day was only 8.5 hours. It was still hard, but not as hard as the 4 day option. We were also able to explore other ruins that the other trips have to pass by. Amazing.

Yes it is challenging Day 2 but absolutely beautiful and you are in the Andes as a lone group. We only saw 2 other small groups the whole time. Traveling up into the hills and seeing the villages of the Quechua and how the mountain people actually live is unforgettable. Our guide, Odon, cook Carletos, asst. cook, Mario and 2 horsemen who brought our tents and bags were quietly efficient and helpful. Odon clearly has a great sense of humor and is a story teller. I would highly recommend this trek for those that prefer a hike with less tourists. Day 1 is easy with a stop at the hot springs which eased us in nicely. Though the hot springs might be nicer on the last day it may not be as good in reverse as the climb down is fairly treacherous due to shale. Seeing really young children looking after their herds or climbing up or down the mountain to go to school was amazing. Coloring pencils and paper can be taken as small gift....also candy. Pachamama arranged everything and is highly recommended tour co. This trek is a combination of 2 nights camping and 1 night in a hotel prior to Machu Pichu. However, you come into MP from below not thru the Sun Gate. we climbed to it and to Wayna Pichu the 4 th day. A not to be forgotten trip......very rewarding."

You do have to be physiclly fit and used to walking, but if you are in good shape you should manage it without too much trouble.What is needed is a lot of stamina. I was expecting it to be so hard that it was in fact easier than I had feared.We went on a teen trek with the Adventure Company. They are OK but they overbooked the trip so you may be better looking for a similiar holiday with Explore or another company. We were a family of 4 aged 11, 14 , 50 and 64. The guides and porters were excellent, and the food they produced was amazing.....we were never short of good quality food..If you enjoy hikking this is really worth doing. Do acclimatise in Cusco for several days before you do the trail. Enjoy!!"

It also makes arriving at Machu Picchu that much sweeter!

The scenery along the way is breathtaking, the hike is challenging and there are various archaeological sites to view along the way. I LOVED IT and it was worth every step to get to Machu Picchu. If you like to hike and camp, this is THE way to get to Machu Picchu!A few things to know if you go: Our only regret is the tour company. SAS must stand for \"Shady. And. Shoddy\". They are disorganized, unprofessional, and their gear was in awful shape (e.g., holes in tents and trekking poles that had metal tips worn through the rubber--specifically not allowed on the Inca Trail). And worst of all, they lied to us several times about having purchased tickets to climb Huayna Picchu which they didn't do. We didn't let them ruin our trek, but I would definitely not wish their services on even my worst enemy! The good reviews you see are older when they were contracted out by another company. I'd recommend G Adventures for this trek as their porters all had professional, warm clothes, nice hiking shoes, and their gear was in excellent shape. Other people we met said they loved this company and their price seems comparable as well. We did not hire a porter, which made our trek more challenging but more rewarding. (I keep saying challenging because you basically hike up and down stairs for 5-7 hours per day, days 2 & 3). We think this is the whole point of trekking and had no regrets about carrying our belongings. However, I wish I had known that the vast majority of people only carry a small day bag so if you carry your own stuff you will likely be slower than everyone in your group. Our guide seemed to doubt us and tried to sell us a porter's service several times on the first day. We also hike and camp regularly so we enjoyed camping. Yeah, the toilets are gross, your tent may get wet, you can't shower. Get over it, you're camping in the Andes!My only complaint about the trail experience was something other reviewers have mentioned: the last day you wake up at 3:30am, wait over an hour in line at the checkpoint until 5:30, then walk 6km to Machu Picchu where you will be greeted at the sun gate by a crowd of tourists who arrived on the bus (gates to MP open at 6:00am). I didn't expect this, and by no means did it ruin my experience but I wish I had known because I thought we'd be the first ones there. We got the impression that we got up that early so the companies don't have to pay the porters anymore than they have to so they send them off on the earliest train possible. Also, Machu Picchu is in a cloud forest so no matter the season there is a good chance you will have rain and clouds (meaning you can't see the ruins when you arrive at the sun gate) that early in the morning. Message me if you have questions or want help with a packing list!"

You also have to go through an authorised company who provides your guide and porters. But once you are through all of that, its a hell of a hike. We did the 4 day, 3 night Inca Trail, but you can go for completing it in a shorter time. However, you would then miss the views, exploring ruins, and just taking it all in. Doing the hike is not a race, but its a hell of an achievement when you make it to the Sun gate and see Machu Picchu beneath you.Day 2 is probably the worse. That climb to 4300m at Dead Womans Pass will test your resolve, lungs and muscles. Then when you make it to the top of the pass, you then have a 2-3 hour descent down very uneven steps!!! Tips are to travel very light. Don't bother with multiple changes of clothes, you only need to change socks and underwear during the 4 day journey. Be warned that the camp site toilets are disgusting and don't forget to bring your own role of toilet paper. A small bottle of hand sanitiser is also a good idea.It's a shame the peruvian government doesn't keep the toilets 'fresher' nor enforce the no-litter rule. The hikers are really to blame for dropping litter and empty drink bottles along the route, but the litter collectors are a waste of time as they miss so much.You also don't need loads of fancy gear. We saw many people with the best and latest gear setting off on the first day, but most of the gear was in their rucksack by the end of the 1st day. You don't really need walking poles. Be sure you have a good pair of broken-in hiking trainers (or boots), good socks, and several clothing layers. Buy a S/-5 plastic poncho from Cusco in case it rains.We did our trek with Apus Peru who were fantastic. See Trip Advisors separate listing for them - just type Apus Peru into the search bar."

My boyfriend and I just recently finished our 4D/3N Comfort trek on the Inca trail with Llama Path. I spent a month pouring over reviews and guides to choose our trekking company, and remained nervous that everything would work out for months after, especially since neither of us had ever done a trek this intensive before. From the very first emails we got from Llama Path my fears were constantly put at ease, and I can say now our decision was most certainly the correct one. I would recommend Llama Path (and our wonderful guide Ruben) for the Inca trail without hesitation. The trek, though, is certainly difficult. After booking our tour 4 months in advance, we started training immediately. Neither of us had ever done a hike this intensive before, and I personally had not hiked or camped seriously since high school. Even with doing a training hike once a week for several months before hand, we struggled many times during the trail.There are no parts that are easy. There are some parts that are easier than others, but even the less strenuous sections are difficult for different reasons (vertigo, altitude, sun exposure, soreness, etc). And at the end of Dead Woman's Pass we were taking it 3 steps at a time and huffing for 30 seconds. But a snail's pace is still a pace and even despite our exhaustion, we made it. And we'll be proud of that fact and remember our trek for the rest of our lives.Also, if you're a history buff (I, for one, was an archaeology major in college) you should know that you'll see more than just Machu Picchu on the trail. We stopped by so many Inca ruins and got to hear about the history of all of them, and I truly believe that some were as beautiful in their own ways as Machu Picchu itself. One of my group members said on the bus ride from Machu Picchu to Aguas Calientes that he was surprised to find that he enjoyed the trek even more than walking through MP. I couldn't agree with him more. For someone who was all but dreading this hike a month ago, that's really saying a lot. If you're up to the challenge and want a truly memorable experience unlike any you'll get elsewhere, I would encourage you to go for it. But trust me on this, hire an extra porter for your stuff. It'll all be hard enough with just a daypack."

Walking level and downhill was no problem and I was well acclimatised to the altitude by the time we started the trek but I was totally unprepared for the sheer physical difficulty of climbing steep slopes and steps while breathing reduced oxygen levels.

My wife & I have just returned from a four week tour of Sth America (Chile, Peru, Brazil & Argentina) and the highlight of our trip by far was the 4 day Inca Trail trek, culminating in witnessing the magnificent Machu Picchu. We are pretty fit, so we had no concerns about our stamina during the journey, for us our biggest dilemma was how to pack and what to take for four days of potentially any weather condition\u2013 without taking a ton of stuff!!! Our trek was in May \u201913 and at that time the official weight a Porter could carry of your personal belongings was 5kg (including your sleeping bag!!) Most sleeping bags we discovered weigh around 1.5kg, which leaves you about 3.5kg of things you\u2019re able to give to your porter to carry (without paying for a private porter). We aimed to keep our own backpacks at 5kg, as every kilo you have extra really takes its toll on you when you\u2019re trekking \u2013 especially on the leg up and over Dead Woman\u2019s pass (named because of the shape of the pass and surrounding peaks, not because a woman died there!!). The most obvious things to carry in your personal pack are clothes for layering \u2013 it\u2019s cold when you start off first thing in the morning at 0 degrees C, but gets hot when you\u2019re climbing steep sections during the afternoon when the temperature has climbed into the teens. We found zip off hiking pants / shorts, breathable t-shirt, light weight fleece top & light jacket (not a ski jacket!) worked well for our layering. Water is another consideration, with every 1 litre weighing 1 kilo \u2013 but you MUST HAVE IT!So after many, many packs & repacks over several weeks this is what we came up with which worked really well for us;5 kg personal pack that we carried ourselves;Sun Hat, Toilet Paper (a must), Head Lamp, Peru Beanie, Woolen Gloves, Camera, Plastic Rain Poncho, Fleece Top, light weight Jacket, Sunglasses, Passports & documents, snacks (chocolate, nuts), 1 litre stainless steel water bottle, singlet top, basic personal medications (we were using Diamox), water purification tablets just in case (our porters boiled enough water each morning before breakfast). This weighed 4.8 kg (3.8kg without the water). 5 kg porter pack (this was gear we didn't need to access during the day)Sleeping bag, socks (3 pair, plus the 4th pair to wear), thermal pants, long sleeve t-shirt, track suit pants, underwear (3 pair, plus 4th to wear), small travel towel, inflatable pillow, minimal toiletries, spare t-shirt, spare shorts/pants. This weighed 5kg (3.5kg not including sleeping bags).The porters carry your self inflating mattress as well as their portion of all the camping requirements for the group (tents, food, etc). It was also recommended that anything we gave the porters to carry be wrapped in plastic bags, as their sweat could potentially make your gear wet \u2013 not ideal for your bedding & night wear to be wet in 0 degrees overnight!!We ended up using 95% of the things we packed during the trek, thankfully it didn\u2019t rain heavily, so we didn\u2019t need to use our spare dry clothing. With some thoughtful pre organisation you should have a fantastic trouble free trekking experience. ENJOY!!!"

We added the challenging Salkantay trek to our adventure at the beginning of the trek, which gave us several days of solitude except for the Quechua speaking villagers we passed along the way. I would suggest doing this if you can. And go with a company like ours: Apus Peru, that really knows the country, gives back to the people, and employs amazing guides, like one we had."

The hike is steep and after you ascend about 2,000 feet above the valley floor, you have amazing, jaw dropping 360 degree vistas of the surrounding mountains with snow capped ones as a perfect back drop. Along the way you pass Incan rest stops, waterfalls, Apos, terraces and marvel at what the Incan's accomplished. We stopped at Huawayna Wawayna (sp?) for lunch. This site provided the agricultural needs for Machu Picchu and is in excellent condition. A great place to have lunch and there are restrooms though primitive, there as well. From our lunch spot, it was a mere 6KM to MP. At this point the trail becomes more rolling and you actually descend into the Sun Gate. After hiking for about 6 hours including stops, you arrive at the Sun Gate and what a fantastic view. Unfortunately, when we got there around 3:30 PM we were looking directly into the sun. It did not matter as MP is beyond description and having walked the Inca Trail made it all the worthwhile."

            "review": "Mixed feelings. We are a couple in our mid 60s who have completed a number of distance treks in various parts of the world in recent years. We completed the Inca Trail in mid-May with Peru Treks in predominantly fine weather with a group size of 16. Peru Treks logistics and support was excellent \u2013 detailed pre-trek info, good equipment, excellent food, transport as promised, good English speaking guide, happy friendly and well-clothed porters.But we do have mixed feelings about this trek. We are pleased to have done it as we had wanted to do it for some time, but there were aspects that disappointed. As other reviews note, it is quite a tough trek - relatively short at 43km but with quite a lot of steep climbing at altitude, especially on Day 2. The scenery is dramatic but we didn\u2019t find it as stunning as on other treks we have done (the frequent cloud/mist can add to the drama or just be a nuisance obscuring the best peaks). You do encounter a very nice series of Inca sites along the way to help build understanding of the complex of settlements and roads they built, and Machu Picchu (MP) is every bit as breathtaking as you would expect, especially its magnificent setting beyond the classic \u2018postcard\u2019 view. But here was the problem that undermined the value of the Trail for me \u2013 Day 4 at MP.Like all groups we woke around 3.45am, had a skimpy breakfast and got in line in the dark to wait for the park gate near the campground at Winay Winay to open at 5.30am. Then it was a mad trek at pace for about an hour and a half to the Sun Gate, on a ridge high above the site. I still don\u2019t know why the rush (very difficult to get there for sunrise when you can\u2019t start til 5.30) \u2013 once there we hung about for ages as groups took turns for photos with distant MP backdrop. Then down the hill to waste more time waiting for individual and group photos directly above the main site. By this time the precious early morning advantage of getting to the site before the main onslaught of daytrippers was fast disappearing. More time spent going down to the main entrance to sort out tickets and deposit large packs (not allowed around the site), so that by the time we actually started see the site (after 9.30am), our group was competing with many other groups \u2013 and 16 is too many for this \u2013 cumbersome as you wind through narrow spaces around other groups and wait for everyone to catch up. So we got around the temple zone by 11am and were then given an hour and a half \u2018free time\u2019 to see all the rest ourselves. MP is a big complex site and this was simply not enough time to see what we had come for and spent three days trekking towards. Others in the group did not seem to mind \u2013 tired after a series of early starts, hard trekking and disturbed sleep, I suspect they were just keen to get done. I was frustrated by the lack of information and guidance to the important features of what I knew to be a fascinating and diverse site, and the lack of time to explore it.So bottom line is, if mountain scenery is your only motivation for doing this trek, it may disappoint, especially if it is cloudy as it often seems to be. If you are genuinely on the trail of the Incas, then the remains along the Trail are interesting and satisfying with a good guide, but look carefully at how you get to see and explore MP itself. While an alternative is to stay over at Aguas Calientes below MP and return the next day, if you are tight for time one day should actually be enough - but it really depends how that day is organised by your trek agency/guide. Re gear to take, other posts have covered this, but our question was - how cold would it be camping in May and would we need down jackets? We decided against these on the basis of weight and we did not need them \u2013 a base T-shirt, long sleeved shirt and fleece were enough for the evenings."

It's not a bad hike at all, but it's just soooo crowded. Hundreds of other trekkers, and of course the guides, cooks and porters, all vying for space on a sometimes 5 meter wide path. I just feel that a trek is so much more unique when there are just a few people hiking. There were at times human traffic jams along some narrow areas and that was really a bit too much for me. A human traffic jam on a trek? That's crazy.Then it was also a little articial. The path was at times built complete with cobble stones. So the whole adventure of hiking on a dirt track is almost gone. Then on the 2nd day, there is also a section of 3 hour downhill steps. Step after step after step. Again, not really an amazing hiking experience when there so many steps. Overall, I felt it was a nice hike but I have had done some much better hikes. The best thing was entering through Inti Punku (Sun Gate) and walking straight into Machu Picchu."

Day 1 is an easy 10K without any serious climbs of descents, day 2 is a serious climb and is very tiring, day 3 is a long descent but is manageable na dday 4 you arrive at Machu Pichu exhausted but having seen some amazing scenery. The tents and food we were given were great, my only complaint would be that the toilets where we camped each night were disgusting. A great trek.

We were provided with a lot of information via email and at the office and were talked through the whole trek at the office (in english). We were collected from our hotel at the time we were told (5.20-6am). Our guide Juan was brilliant, really informative and looked after us really well. You can hire a porter for $50 to carry up 6 kilos for you. Porters carry the tents and food etc. but you need to carry up your gear plus your sleeping bag and mat (which you can rent from Peru Treks for $20 - very competitive). If you haven\u00b4t trekked much before I would definitely recommend getting a porter. Several people in our group didn\u00b4t and then hired local porters for 90 soles a day which ended up costing more. On the other hand, if you trek a lot, 6 kilos isn\u00b4t that much and my partner carried up our sleeping bags and mats for us. You can buy water on the first two days and there are also streams where you can get water (MicroPur tablets are available from pharmacies in Cusco). On the third day and fourth day some boiled water is provided and there are also streams. The food is AMAZING and there is a lot of it, but probably worth bringing a few snacks (although these can alos be purchased on day one and two). It is very cold on the first two nights so bring some thermals. In the day time its hot and the third night is also pleasant. There are a lot of midges and mosquitos on day 1 and 4 so worth bringing bug spray. The first day is relatively easy. Day 2 is tough with a 3 hour ascent and some downhill. Day 3 was my favourite day, it\u00b4s undulating with steps up and down. Day 4 you get up really early (we got up at 3.30am) and aim to get to the checkpoint asap where you have to queue until 5.30am. It\u00b4s then about an hour to the SunGate if you\u00b4re fast. We had a fantastic view of Machu Michu as the mist rose, but it fell again soon after (other times there\u00b4s no mist). Then about another 45 minutes to Machu Pichu which is well worth the hike!The toilets in the campsites are not that bad if you\u00b4ve hiked before (probably at the upper end from our experience) but seem to be a bit shocking to some...Breakfast on Day 1 is not included and is 20 soles for a buffet, 3 soles for black coffee, 5-8 soles for a sandwich. The prices are a bit inflated but the restaurant let\u00b4s you eat your own stuff there if you bring it from Cusco. They also sell walknig poles in a shop downstairs for 6 soles which are well worth it if you don\u00b4t have your own and are sawn to size when you buy them. The lunch on Day 4 in Agua Calientes is also not included. It\u00b4s about 30 soles for a meal, 8 soles for a soft drink. We went to the market down the road and had a set menu (soup and main) for 7 soles... the restaurant stores your bag regardless whether you eat. We got the train at 6.45pm. There\u00b4s not much to do in Agua Calientes but time went by fairly quickly. You can get an earlier train but then you have to organise your own transport from Ollyabamba rather than getting the Peru Treks bus back to Cusco. Peru Treks will give you advice on tips - we spent about 100 soles each in total for the porters (20), the cook, the assistant guide and the guide. I would definitely recommend going with Per Treks!"

It does work. Cocoa leaves weren't great.We signed up with SAS travel, who were fantastic. The guide was very friendly and the porters were machines. The food is surprisingly good for camping food. My wife had her birthday on the last night and they made a birthday cake. Very impressive considering the equipment they had.Each morning we'd wake up to breakfast waiting for us. We'd start walking and the porters would overtake us and set lunch up and the same happened at the end of the day when you stop for the day and have dinner. Nice when your tents are all setup and ready for you.The second day was the hardest. We elected to make the third camp at the end of the second day, so we covered 13 kms in total that day. It made the last 2 days a breeze.We did the trail in December so it was extremely wet. Luckily the last day when we got to the sungate the weather cleared up and it was sunny while we walked around machu picchu. An amazing place, especially after you've hiked for 4 days to get there.There are a number of ruins that you can travel to off the track which your guide will tell you about. Make sure you do all of these as some of these are fantastic. Make sure you take some cash, as you can get drinks on the trail and you need to tip the guide, cook and porters.Tips: Don't take too much gear, especially jumpers. When walking you are very warm. Also don't bother taking raincoats. Buy the cheap plastic ones from Cuzco or at the camp on the way to the start of the trail. They are light, plastic and breath which helps when walking.Take a headlamp. They are cheap in Cuzco. Handy for those nightly missions to the toilet or bush."

The second day was quite challenging with a good 3-5 hour walk (depending on fitness level) up steep stairs to get to dead woman's pass but once at the top it was well worth it. From there it was a steep downhill to the next camp site. The downhill is just as hard as the uphill and goes on for ages. But nothing beats camping high up in the mountains. I highly recommend doing the hike over just a day trip to MachuPicchu as the satisfaction you get from it is so worth it. I believe that the Machupicchu site should be closed to day tourists until 10am so the people that have done the hike get the ruins to themselves for a few hours before letting the general tourists in :)"

I'm definitely in that category and am in my late 40s. This trail was the hardest physical challenge I've faced. Out of the four days we had rain on 3 and that made the stone path even more challenging. The trail is not packed dirt, but stones and stairs (many of which are vertical ascents or descents). This combined with the altitude make for long hikes. My longest mile ever was straight up on this trail. Make sure you understand the physical challenge you are undertaking.That said, with the exception of the second day (the toughest), I finished the trail within the guides' recommended time frame and even with the rain the scenery was spectacular. This was definitely a once in a lifetime hiking trip for my family (husband and 18 year old son). In addition to being aware of the difficulty of the hike note that the campsites are rustic along the way. One place we stayed did not have flush toilets/hole in the ground. There were no showers, and we stayed in tents. As an aside, I'd highly recommend our outfitters, Pachamama. Also parts of the trail are cliffside with no guard rails/barriers so if you are wary of heights take note that you will be pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Again, I'm not trying to dissuade you from the hike because I thought it was incredible, but sharing information that I wish I had known to better prepare myself."

We stayed 2 days in cusco prior to the tour. I had altitude sickness for the two days in cusco and also 3 days on the hike.When you get to the start of the trail, you have to pay 1 sole to use the restroom or you can wait to go along the trail. My tip is to bring a lot of toilet paper and personal wipes with you as there is absolutely no toilet paper on the trail or even in town/airports! The first day hiking was hard for our group who came from sea level. We were unable to make it to our camp side so we stayed at an emergency campsite which has really disgusting facilities (make sure to put your pant legs in your boots so you don't get any poop on your pants by accident). Most people didn't bother going into the one shed which had a toilet (no toilet seat or lights) and an aluminum door which didn't lock. Instead everyone went on the side of the building with views of the Andes. The most magical part of the trail is that you hike for 8-10 hours a day, sweat a lot and you don't smell . . . . at all. Even for the smelliest person, your sweat is clean. It's really freaky, but now I understand why people don't really complain about not showering. I also have really long hair and my hair was not oily until the 4th day - normally I wash my hair every 2 days.On the 2nd day, we lost two people who had to head back down to town due to lack of oxygen. Our tour guide arranged for the couple to get on a horse because one of them was unable to hike back down. It took them 6 hours by horse to get into town. Turns out our friend caught pneumonia and had to get into cusco city in order to go to the clinic. 4 of us continued on the trail. This was the most difficult day on the trail. I was unable to breathe by the time we got close to dead woman's pass. It was all uphill on rocky terrain and then completely downhill for the rest of the trail into the campsite. We didn't make it to our normal campsite since we were behind 2 hours of hiking. The porters all \"hop\" down the stone steps, but that's an easy way for you to twist your ankle or worse, fall off the trail! It was very cold this night but again, we did not stink after all the hiking. At this campsite, we didn't bother walking to the bathroom since it was so far and did our business behind the tents.On our 3rd day, this was the longest hike yet since we had to make up 2 additional hours of hiking. This was an extremely long day and we ended up hiking in the dark to make it to the campsite (closest one to the check in point). I cursed a lot. Altitude sickness does a number on you by making you extremely irrational, irritated, difficult of breathing which makes hiking even more difficult, unable to sleep at night, unable to eat which then makes you constipated. Everyone else in my group didn't get altitude sickness as bad and enjoyed the hike very much.On the 4th day, we woke up at 4am to wait in line to start the hike to the sungate. The hike was about 1-1.5 hours long and up some ridiculously steep stairs to the sungate. It was amazing to finally see machu picchu and be able to walk around the city.If I had known how sick I would get on the trail, I would take the train up. The other 3 people in my group loved the hike, but i had many issues during and after the hike including getting really sick. There was only 1 day out of 10 days on our trip that I didn't get sick. I would say if you are adventurous and enjoy hiking to do the trail, but highly recommended to take altitude medicine so it doesn't ruin your hike. Machu Picchu is amazing and if your legs don't give out by the 4th day, try to climb huayna picchu. We booked the tickets but after all the hiking, our legs couldn't do it. I will say that I didn't lose weight (not sure why considering I barely ate on the entire trail), but my calves look great. Also we were extremely lucky with the weather, absolutely no rain.Make sure to pack layers as the trail gets really hot, then extremely cold by the 2nd day. Also, wear long pants because I wore shorts the first day and got bitten like crazy even with bug spray. The bugs are not mosquitoes and once you get bitten, you bleed first then it will welt up. Even after 3 weeks, I still have 20 or so bite marks on both my legs. We also felt like we over packed. We brought towels which we didn't need and too much coconut drink powder (like gatorade). Also we packed a lot of toilet paper and wipes (which we did not regret) and medicine (mostly immodium). We packed a lot more clothes than we normally due since we wanted to make sure we had clean underwear and shirts for all the days of the hike. I wouldn't pack mouth wash since we were able to brush our teeth on the trail or dry shampoo (didn't use it) and not bring the poncho since we had really good rain jackets. Since I was sick at the end of the trip, dragging my pack through our 14 hour flight with 2 transfer was very painful.All in all, it was indeed an adventure. I was really happy when we got back to Miami and there were flushable toilets with plenty of toilet paper !!"

Some training is in order for sure. Our provider Inca Trails Reservations was not all that great and was fairly disorganized. For the first two days we hiked longer days than the other groups, only to have a very short day on the third. The guide was average. All and all I would recommend this to anyone in reasonable shape but with a different provider."

Possibly the crowds, but the further you get away from Machupicchu the less people there are. The guides are all wonderful, there are bathrooms although they're not free and they're smelly. Who cares? The site is beautiful and the visit is informative. Go see the sun gate because you get to see the opposite side of Machupicchu and the views are breathtaking. Walk as far and long as you think you can, it's worth it! The bus ride to get to the entrance is not for the faint of heart. Lots of switchbacks & steep dropoffs. Had to list this as July, but we went in January. It was a little rainy, mostly sunny, T-shirt & shorts to long sleeves at night in Peru."

            "review": "Amazing 4 day hike with out-adventures. The Inca Trail is well known so I won't go into great detail, but need to say that it's worth all the effort. The adventure may seem daunting, but you have many choices on how to tackle the trail from carrying all of your own equipment with a guide; carrying your own equipment with guide and cooks; or as in my case a guide, cook, and porters carrying provided camping gear. Along the trail I saw all walks of life from teenagers to 65+ year old trekkers. No matter how you travel be prepared to rough it (Incan toilets == bush or tree) as you will ascend 6000+ feet over 24 miles, but the pay off in sights and sense of accomplishment is worth it!The trail is highly regulated so the number of people on the trail is capped so you'll have many moments where you feel like you're the only one on the trail which makes the experience even more magical. You'll cross through many climates from woods, to cloud forest, to barren peaks which means you'll go from sun, rain and sometimes snow. So be well prepared and bring many layers.Along the way you will experience many amazing vistas, visit less travelled Inca ruins, and see all sorts of local plants and animals including orchids, tucans, giant humming birds, condors, and if you are lucky a spectacled bear.My tour operator, out-adventures (LGBT themed) made the journey as comfortable as possible and focuses on providing a socially conscious experience. Our guides Maritza and Tomas provided excellent history as well as knowledge of local flora and fauna."

For anyone like myself who takes pleasure in physically trying tasks and history this is a a go to vacation. I did the 4 day trail and felt amazing to be able to have hot breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the Andes mountains especially after hiking for several hours. The second day of the Inca trail is literally walking up steep steps for hours, but the view afterwards is amazing. The 3rd day is almost a reverse of the 2nd day so get ready for using your walking poles and protecting your knees downhill. The final day going to Machu Picchu was by far the easiest and had the greatest photo opportunity. The entire trail was great for meeting new people, feeling accomplished, and getting great photos all for a very reasonable price. Any people interested in adventures on a budget should seriously consider."

The Inca Trail and Macchu Picchu have been on my wish list for a few years and I was so glad I did it and would recommend GAdventures as travelling with them made it all the more better.The Trail itself involves 3 days of walking ranging from long periods of steep climbing and descending to more gentle terrain. All of it is across stones laid by the incas centuries ago. There are over 6000 steps across the 3 days. So sturdy shoes are essential and walking sticks/poles make a positive difference so I would recommend getting/hiring them. The train is more enjoyable the fitter you are. I managed it comfortably, but at times it was tough going. After the 3 days of walking and then sleeping in tents I was pretty knackered. - but it was worth it. I dealt with altitude sickness by taking Diamox from the day before I got to Cusco and then spent two days in Cusco then travelling to the Sacred Valley before starting the trail. I was lucky and did not suffer during the Trail. I think I was the only one in my group who took Diamox as a preventative measure but everyone else was fine - I think mainly due to being at altitude for a couple of days before starting the trail.GAdventures made the experience better with an amazing chef, assistant chef and team of porters. I completely agree with the requirement that we could only pack a bag with 6kg for each of us that the Porters carried. The Porters were so amazing carrying our tents and food. At every stop we had plenty of well cooked food. Too much at times and I felt guilty when I could not eat all that was given.Our Tour Guide and Assistant Guide were amazing, encouraging and knowledgeable. Thank you so much Max and Daniel. The early start (3 am wake up) on the last day was worth it as our group were the first to make it to the Sun Gate and the view of Macchu Picchu is breathtaking. GAdventures are good at this and the other key factors that made it such a good experience were:-an amazing group who I miss loads since getting back home-the weather for most of the time was good for hiking, it only really rained on one night. I think May is a good time to do this tripI do not miss the squat toilets at the campsites or having to share a tent with my mate, but the sacrifice was worth it for 3 and a half days of walking the trail and feeling like you have earned that view of Macchu Picchu"

We are in excellent health and very fit, but we are over 60 and decided this is a trek for the under 50 group. We have done a lot of mountain-climbing, including Kilimanjaro less than 3 years ago, but this is the hardest climb we've ever done. The terrain is very steep, and the extremely long downhill stretches batter your knees terribly. Be prepared also to deal with gross and disgusting restrooms along the entire trail and toilet paper strewn along the path, because you are not aloud to put it in the toilets."

The check in gate, which is 4 km from the gate, opens at 5:30. Sunrise is at 6:00 pretty much every day. The reason you get up at 3:30 am is because the guides need to make their train back at 4:25 or something so you have to break camp early!!! Even so, this is a spectacular trip. Even though we had a lot of rain, we loved every minute. If you really want to see Machu Pichu at sunrise, the park gates don't open until 6 AM so whether you stay at the Sanctuary hotel, or bus in from Aqua Caliente or hike up from Agua Caliente -- everyone pretty much gets to the park at the same time. Make sure you book hiking up Whyna Pichu -- in advance. You cannot book onsite."

The trail is 50 kms long and includes reaching an altitude of 4300 meters. It's important to spend about three days in Cusco or somewhere nearby to acclimatize before beginning the strenuous hike. We travelled with SAS, had two guides, several porters, and two cooks along with us for 9 hikers. Our group was from four different countries and was a great mix of young and not-so-young folks. We supported and cheered each other on as we conquered Dead Woman's Pass, the highest point of the hike. The food we had each day was plentiful and delicious, providing lots of energy for our trek. We encountered a lot of rain, even though it was the \"dry season\", so this impeded our views somewhat. But the morning we reached the Sun Gate at 7 AM and looked down on Machu Picchu was one I will never forget. This is a very special and memorable experience. Hiking is the best way to get to the site, since it is overrun by tourists who come in on the train shortly after early morning."

The Trail itself is magical...a true world class hiking experience. Incaland also made it special. Their equipment is top notch, but their real strength is customer service. I booked at least six months prior to our hike, and during that time, I wrote Flavio (the owner) with endless questions. I always got an immediate and helpful response from him. Upon arrival in Cusco, he came to our hotel with our guide for trip orientation. He made everything clear and easy, and we truly appreciated his professionalism. (He even provided a taxi to the airport when we departed even though this was not a part of our package.)Perhaps most impressive was our guide,Hugo. Hugo was a seasoned guide who had even led a National Geographic team when they visited the region. He is Quechua...descended from the people who actually built Machu Picchu. His knowledge of the history of the Quechua and the flora along the trail was encyclopedic. His patience and kindness were most impressive, however. My wife unexpectedly developed exercise-induced asthma on trail, and progress became quite slow. To steady her, Hugo loaned her his hiking stick so that she would have two. This was in spite of the fact that he had sore knees from extensive hiking (i.e., he sacrificed himself so that my wife would be safer and more secure). His patience was boundless. As other hikers turned back, Hugo did all he could to make sure that my wife finished the hike. This is a quality that we had not expected but fully appreciate. (Turning back means that the money invested in the hike is lost.)By the way, the food was outstanding. As a longtime backpacker, I expected the food to be simple fare, dehydrated food, etc. Quite the contrary, soups, salads, fresh fruit, vegetables, meats, and deserts awaited us at camp. Given the rigors of the trail, this proved to be a great psychological boost. This is a quality outfitter and one that both my wife and I highly recommend without equivocation. There must be hundreds of outfitters in Cusco. Incaland Adventures has got to be at the top of the list. I would not even consider another outfitter when (I hope) we get to go again. They are absolutely outstanding!"

The trail is demanding so you do have to be of a reasonable level of fitness and properly prepared.The rewards are the fantastic scenery, historical interest along the way and the great sense of accomplishment you feel when you finally reach Machu Picchu."

Actually tourists who go into the Machu Picchu sanctuary for a few hours alone really do miss out on this marvelous and mysterious place. A short visit only gives you a stolen glimpse of this impressive empire and does absolutely no justice to this marvelous and mysterious place. The 2 day/ 1 night option allows you to experience some of the secrets of the incas whithout camping in close proximity to aboultion facilities. There is no way to explain the surpise of that \"oooo wooow\" when after a four hour steep walk upwards, crossing the path of the second most important Inca ruin \"Wina Wayna\", (which by the way is beautiful and well worth the climb you scramble up a steep flight of stairs and then your breathe is truly taken away at the Sun gate. The view of the Machu Picchu sanctuary spreads out before you in full view down below. No words can explain the feeling that you get with that spectacular view. You arrive late in the afternoon when all the hoards of tourist buses have left and the sanctuary is almost free of people. You get to appreciate Machu Picchu in its entirety undisturbed, peaceful and out of this world!The next morning when you go up, once again you arrive in the sanctuary before the hoards of tourist arrive again.Tourists who opt for the 4 day inca trail should be prepared that the sleeping conditions are not that great. There are rows and rows of tents on banks of sand paths, on different levels that are literally flanked onto the very smelly abolution facilities that are not very clean. Although we did not do the four day hike, I was thankful that we didn't as the camping situation really is not like being out in the wilderness. With hoards of different trekking groups I believe that there is no stillness of the night that one would want to experience amidst the mountains.2 day / 1 night is a definite must!! Highly recommended.We entered Machu Picchu sanctuary on the third day and we were so glad we did. We climbed the steep Huayna Picchu (of which you must pre book in advance because there are a limited 200 tickets for the 7am climb and 200 for the 10 am climb). Do the first session. You get to see the sun rise of Machu Picchu and it gives you more time to explore the area before the heat of the day.If you're lucky you'll get to see Machu Picchu when the sky is clear blue and the sun is out, as well as early in the morning when the sanctuary is covered in clouds. Watching the cloads lift up over the mountains offer a completely different atmosphere - mystical.Many tour companies offer this 2 day/1 day inca trail. Make sure you get one that offers a guaranteed hike, even if there are only two people. In this way they will always link you up with another group. We were two people and we linked up with another group of two people. We used View Peru and were very ahppy with the organisation that was all done through Xtreme Adventouras.We pre booked our own trains and hotel accommodation instead of taking a pre-organised all-inclusive package. It suited what we wanted and we landed up saving. You don's have to spend a fortune with highly priced tour operators. After much research we spend half the amount of what other tours charge and probably got the same tour and 5* accommodation that we wanted.ENjoy Machu Picchu. It is an experience of a lifetime"

We did this back in October with Llama Path and LOVED IT!!We went with Llama Path because we had friends who told us they were fantastic and because they actually take care of their employees properly. They give them health benefits, housing between treks, proper footware and clothing etc. etc. Some other companies just hire porters for one trek at a time so that they don't have to give them any benefits and they can abuse them...so be careful who you book with.The trail itself is VERY VERY HARD. Please know this before you go. My friends and I are not in bad shape, I know that I work out a few times a week, I enjoy going for walks, hot yoga classes, I figure skated competitively for 15 years and cheerlead competitively for 9 years, and I found this trek VERY VERY HARD. So please don't underestimate it!!Make sure you acclimatize for DAYS before you try this. We only spent 1 day in Cuzco before the trek, which apparently was not enough! Also make sure you break in your hiking shoes before you go and bring lots of band-aids and antiseptic/antibiotic creams for scrapes/blisters. Bring a very good poncho and make sure your boots are at least water-resistant (if not water proof) or you will be miserable if you get rained on. Bring an umbrella too!!Bring bio-degradable toilet paper and flashlights that clip to you or that you can wear around your neck or head....otherwise you will find them very difficult to use. Bring lots of hand sanitizer. The bathrooms along the way are few and far between and they are literally holes in the ground. At the last camp site there are showers but they are freezing cold water with very little privacy and they are not cleaned, so bring shoes you can wear in the shower and a towel that will dry quickly.Bring lots of sunscreen - LOTS. I put mine on multiple times a day and somehow burned myself so badly that it blistered and scabbed!!!!!!Bring a camel pack for water if you can. If you can't, make sure you have a convenient way to carry your water bottle (bring a big water bottle...you can only get water in the morning before you hike and at lunch...if you run out in between you're out of luck!)We loved, loved, loved this experience.Definitely do it!!"

So in generally the porters are treated really bad even if your company claims to be sustainable. They are usually given little clothes (maybe a uniform - thin trousers and top). They may only work 3 times a month and only get paid about 200 soles a trip. If any kit breaks they have to pay for it (even if you break it). They sleep in the mess tent together with no sleeping bags. Only get limited food I.e. soup. If they injur themselves then its not the companies problem. They have no long term help if they stop work. This is why the tip is important to them. I don't agree with this but until the companies can be held responsible its a little help which goes direct to the porters. Start asking companies what they do for the porters. I wanted to confront my company but our guide was scarred he would lose his job. Hence the post here."

The air was a bit thin going over Dead Woman's Pass but I did not suffer from the altitude as I thought I might have done at 59 years old! You need a good level of fitness and if you are going to do the trek I would suggest getting some serious walking done before you go - and take a good pair of boots! The scenery is stunning and that first sight of Macchu Pichu takes your breath away as you enter through the Sun Gate. The tour guide and porters were exceptional and I never once felt that we were being treated as tourists - they wanted to share their land with us. I cannot recommend this trak enough."

Spectacular scenery, knowledgeable, competent, friendly guides(Inca Natura), herculean porters, exhilarating conditions and a strenuous but achievable hike. What more could you want. Don't kid yourself, this is a hike that requires training and planning and you need to be sure you have great equipment. Invest in good, ankle height, waterproof boots, hiking poles and waterproof rain gear. If you are on a guided hike with porters, they will carry most of your gear. Your backpack just needs to be big enough for what you need each day (rain gear, water bottles, snacks, warmth layers, gloves, hat etc.) so you don't need an overly large pack. Bring electrolyte tablets for your water bottle and some extra snacks to share with the porters who are amazing! I have always had an overwhelming fear of heights and must say I was nervous about going. Other that a few places on the trail (where my wonderful hiking companions walked on the outside edge) I was fine. Don't miss this incredible hike for fear of heights. The scenery is spectacular.

The section up to Winay Wayna is not the same true part of the Inca trail hiked by the 4 day hikers. So the only section that is common with the 4 day trail and out of limits from Machu Picchu with just a Machu Picchu entrance ticket is the very short section from Intipata to the checkpoint. Of course, you can not see the Winay Wayna ruins up close if you don't do this trail. Likewise, although I don't think it is standard, our guide allowed us to go to Intipata ruins also which we really enjoyed. In fact, we liked the Intipata ruins more than Winay Wayna."

It is physically demanding but there is no time limit so you go at your own pace. And don't be scared of dead woman's pass ( like I was)! It's a tough climb up but after that you can do anything! And going down is harder :POur tour guide was a local, knowledgable and fantastic! The porters were all locals and were well looked after - they did an amazing job!The food prepared was 3 course meals and very delicious. Tents and equipment clean and in good condition.Tips for the trip-Make sure you have enough time in cusco to acclimatise- at least 2 days!Coca lollies helped me through!We went in the wet season which is obviously wet but a little warmer at night and less people on the trail.If you travel in the wet season make sure you get a good waterproof jacket and water proof pants. We used ponchos and they were hot, annoying to put on and made it hard to see when you were going down steps. And get good waterproof shoes- my boots were a godsend especially when I took my feet out and they were dry!Make sure you layer up. I took a fresh singlet for each day but wore the same t- shirt, long sleeved shirt, jumper and jacket. The climate changes and sometimes your sweating it out, others its freezing cold and your wearing gloves.Don't forget to take your own toilet paper, electrolyte pills, chocolate (a snickers bar or 5 gives you a good boost of energy!) change of clothes for the evening so your not wearing your hiking gear all the time! A good sleeping bag is a must! You can hire walking sticks (a good idea if you have sore knees or ankles) and an extra air mattress with G Adventures-I'd recommend both!Be responsible on the trek. There are times when it's possible to badly injure or kill yourself if your not careful! A bit morbid I know but it's the truth. If you choose to trek the Inca Trail it will be a once in a life time, amazing experience! And when you arrive at Machu Picchu smelly and tired- you'll be so proud of yourself, make fun of everyone who took the train and you wouldn't have had it any other way! Enjoy!"

I trained for about 6 weeks before the trip doing a lot of hiking, but if I had to do it again, would probably spend more time on a stairmaster - for hour increments. There is a lot of consistent upward hiking, especially on day 2. Hiring hiking poles and a porter were a good choice for me.

There are several archeological sides on the way and it is very interesting to find out about their advanced culture from the guides. On te 4th day you get to Machu Picchu, fantastic and 2nd most important city of Inka Empire. Don't forget to book Wayanapicchu, it is a cherry on the top of the cake, spectacular views on the mountains and Machu Picchu from the top. Go for it!"

The max was going from 3000 meters to 4215 meters in a matter of about 3+ hours. With a back pack (even 15-20 lbs will feel heavy at that altitude). Longest day was about 10 hours including a couple stops. And you're sleeping in tents - there is no bed like home, and the ground isn't made buy Beautyrest. That being said, many people do it, and I'd do it again. Even early March wasn't too too bad for rain, but we got some, and real hard on the 4th day into Machu Picchu which caused for fog to obscure the climactic view coming in. I would recommend April (less rain, and before the cold weather comes). Used SAS Peru as a tour group, and they did an outstanding job +++"

            "review": "Bamba Experience is the way to do it!. The Inca Trail is a really great way to go to Machu Picchu. It's a 4 day trek starting from the Sacred Valley! The first day you trek around 6 hours, but it's not that hard you go up and down and up and down, but it's simple (specially compared to the next two days). On day two you trek going up, up, up, up, up for around 6 hours... The views are amazing, and you do get tired specially after you go up to 4200 meters! Then you walk around 2 more hours and you arrive to the campsite. We traveled with Bamba Experience and it was really great, as they organize the tents for you, they cook really amazing meals, and their guide was really knowledgable and very nice person! Every day they woke us up with a cup of coca tea (so, a great way to wake up) On day three for us it was the hardest, as you have to walk down most of the time, and if your knees are not great then it will hurt a lot! You walk for around 7 - 8 hours. On day 4 it's an easy hike but very early in the morning and you reach Machu Picchu through the sun gate. We where not lucky and could not see Machu Picchu from there as it was very foggy (as we went on January 2013 and it's rainy season). But we then walked down to Machu Picchu and the fog disappeared and we had some great views of Machu Picchu.We highly recommend doing the Inca Trail if you feel up for it and we recommend Bamba Experience as your local operator."

            "review": "Not for Everyone. We did not have a great Inca Trail experience. I will try to be objective and as fair as possible in my review. Bottom line up front: this hike is not for everyone. Machu Picchu can be for everyone and there is no shame in taking the train into Aguas Calientes to catch the tour bus up the mountain for the day. I wish very much that we had.A little background on us: my fiance and I are both 32 years old and in reasonably good shape. Between us we have run two marathons and about a dozen half-marathons, hiked a portion of the Camino in Spain, and are otherwise fairly active. We are travelers but not mountain climbers or campers. I was in the Army and spent two years in the Middle East in fairly austere environments.Our trip began with two days in Cusco allowing our bodies to adjust to the altitude. We both took Diamox and had no issues with sickness. Get a prescription before you go, it will help. We booked our hike through SAS. They picked us up at our hotel very early on the first day. We stopped briefly to pick up other members of the group, then stopped on the edge of town where all of the porters got on the bus. There were no more seats left so they all crammed in and sat on the floor for two hours as we made our way toward the trail head. Not a fantastic or comfortable ride for anyone or a good start to the trip.The terrain between Cusco and the trail is mountainous with many hills and switchbacks. Our small minibus stopped on the side of the road so a girl could get off and vomit. By the time we arrived at the trail two members of the group were sick, one from altitude and one from motion sickness.To say the hike is challenging may be misleading. Some people will think it's a walk in the park, while others will say it's nearly impossible. Here's the deal for the average person: it's hard. Very hard. The terrain is uneven and you are walking up and down mountains for several days carrying a load. Our guide, while kind and helpful, talked a lot. We seemed to always be running behind his schedule (but he continued to stop and lecture) and we arrived at camp late with little time to get situated before dark. Campers will have no problem with spending the night on the trail. Non-campers will find it difficult. The ground is hard, even with a small mattress, and it's cold. Getting up in the night to go to the bathroom is extra fun. It's not like regular camping where you can wander twenty yards away from your tent. You have to get dressed, locate a bathroom (more on those later) and find your way back in the sea of tents that all look alike. It is a twenty minute process and it sucks.The views on the hike are really amazing. We passed through several different ecosystems along the way and enjoyed the panoramic scenes after climbing the steepest parts of the trail. Unfortunately during the course of the next three days about half of our group was sick. We all ate the same food and drank the same water so it is very unlikely there was food poisoning. The sanitary conditions on the trail were abysmal. I just read a review and someone mentioned the 'clean' bathrooms. Nope. Not on the Inca Trail. They were beyond disgusting and would have benefited from a couple gallons of bleach being sprayed everywhere. I stayed out of them as much as possible and firmly believe they had something to do with everyone becoming sick. I used hand sanitizer as liberally as possible all the time. My fiance was not so lucky. Around dinner time on the last night on the trail she became sick. It seemed everyone was sick on the last night. As she was vomiting outside our tent in the middle of the night another member of the group emerged from her tented and got sick. I was up trying to help and noticed the sounds of people getting sick all around us. It was terrible.The porters needed to catch a train back to Cusco very early (we were told), so we had to get up at 4am on the last day of the hike. We were also told everyone wants to reach the sungate by sunrise to see Machu Picchu at dawn. Sunrises are overrated. I've slept at the top of Mount Sinai in Egypt to see the sunrise. While beautiful there is too much emphasis placed upon them and most experiences would be the same whether taking place at sunrise or mid-morning. It didn't matter in this instance because it started to rain at 3am. The walk on the last day was tough. My fiance was very sick and weakened. It was raining and we had very little visibility. There were several parts of the trail with steep cliffs and only a narrow path. We moved slowly and I'm glad we didn't die. Our group moved on and we trudged through the rain for several hours before arriving at the sun gate. Our guide met us there and told us to head below to Machu Picchu for a morning of lectures. I was contemplating taking my fiance straight to a hospital and the only thing on my agenda was getting off of the mountain. It took us another hour and a half to reach the buses and we bypassed Machu Picchu altogether. It didn't really matter though because it was rainy and foggy and there were no \"sights\" to be seen. We spent the night at the Inkaterra and were never happier to see a real bathroom. I can't say enough great things about this hotel and their staff. We tried to head up the mountain the next day to see Machu Picchu. As soon as the bus reached the top the floodgates opened up again. We entered the gates as rain poured down and a man was being carried out with his leg bent in an unnatural manner and a look of agony on his face. We only stayed for about fifteen minutes and then waited in the rain for about 45 minutes trying to get off the mountain once again.We caught an afternoon train back to Cusco. They played the same 3 techno songs on a continuous loop at a very loud volume the whole trip. Half-way through a man dressed like a clown with a devil mask appeared in our car and started dancing. I'm serious. You can't make this stuff up. All we wanted to do was sleep but that was not on their agenda. After the clown departed the train attendants put on a \"fashion show\" for another 20 minutes and we were given the opportunity to buy alpaca sweaters and scarves. No thanks.As you can see we had some bad luck on this trip and hopefully others have had much more positive experiences on the Inca Trail. We certainly enjoyed the professionalism of our two guides. The porters were some of the hardest working folks I've ever encountered. They carried loads far exceeding anything we carried, some only wore sandals as shoes, and they all maintained a killer pace in front of us in order to reach camp and have it set up as we arrived each evening. This speaks very well about SAS as a company and I'm sure they do the Inca Trail tour as good if not better than anyone else. The negative comments about our trip have more to do with the sanitary conditions on the trail and the nature of hiking and camping rather than our tour company. If hiking the Inca Trail is something you've always wanted to do, you should certainly do it. Manage your expectations and understand it is an austere environment and things may not go your way in the mountains."

So to bring her on board, I arranged a high end experience thru Perivian Soul travel. Diego arranged an amazing itinerary which started with a few days in the Sacred Valley before the 4 day, 3 night hike. Good way to acclimate. The trip was amazing. Our guide Walther was very good, the cuisine was superb and the scenery was sublime. It is a challenging hike but if you are someone who exercises regularly, it is not too hard. Machu Pichu is all the more amazing when you see it after hiking the Inca trail- it all makes more sense. If it is on your bucket list, go do it!"

            "review": "awesome experience. Our group of four went on a private trek to Machu Picchu with peru path in september 2012. We chose to do a longer version of the trek, the first three days on the Salkantay trek and joining the Inca Trail on the fourth. This took us to some beautiful valleys and over a nearly 5000 metre pass with close-up views of the Salkantay mountain, and we were almost the only people there walking. We then joined the Inca Trail proper for days four to seven, and were a half day ahead of the 500 people who set out from Cusco, so we had really peaceful walking, quiet campsites and clean bathrooms for almost the entire hike. If you have the time, this is a great way to do it, and if you are in Peru, and you are fit, you really should do it, it is unforgettable. The scenery is spectacular and Machu Picchu itself is incomparable. Don't go into it without preparation though- there are long, steep climbs, high steps and the air is thin. We got the best service from peru path, they were always on time to meet us in Cusco with a modern vehicle and a good driver and their representative fredy was very friendly. On our trek we had a very knowledgeable guide, pavel, and a great cook, Marcelino, the gear was all modern and the atmosphere in the group was always happy and cheerful. We highly recommend these guys.thanks for a wonderfull hike into the andes of peru"

            "review": "It's not easy but it is epic!. I did the Inca trail as part of a GAdaventures tour, there were about 13 of us walking with an amazing guide Rosa, 2 assistant guides and a large support group of cooks and porters I'm reasonably fit and have done some hiking before though nothing at that these kinds of altitudes. I knew it was going to be tough but I couldn't have imagined just how hard some parts would be, especially recovering from a severe stomach bug I'd had just two days before. But even so I'd do it again and definitely recommend doing it anyone! Overview:Day 1 starts off relatively easily with gentle climbs, some mild Inca steps and beautiful scenery including your first set of Inca ruins. Day 2 is known as the hardest day for a reason....you're essentially walking uphill at increasing altitude for about 5 hours until you reach the highest part of the trek - Dead Woman's Pass - at 4,200m. But of course, what goes up must come down and you get to tackle lots of lovely uneven Inca steps on your wobbly legs to get to your camp. I'm not going to lie there were tears, lots and lots of stops to 'admire the scenery' (or just catch your breath) but we all managed it! Day 3 - from where we camped you could see the uphill path for the start of our third day, however once we'd completed this climb the views were amazing and the walk through the cloud forest was brilliant - easily my favourite part of the trail. We stopped for lunch and watched the clouds roll in and then prepared ourselves for the afternoon downhill - 2,500 Inca steps known as the 'Gringo Killers' for their uneven, slippy and steep nature - I've never been so happy to have walking poles in my life! (Watch out for the giant stone guinea pig). The final set of ruins you get to before camp are amazing and I think our whole group was slightly giddy at being so close to our end goal. Day 4 starts super early as you wait with all the other trekkers until the check point opens, you then walk faster than you've walked throughout the trek, through the cloud forest and up the monkey steps (prepare to scramble) to reach the sun gate. Seeing Machu Picchu for the first time is amazing and you do feel incredibly elated and proud that you've completed it. You'll sit and take in the view for a while and then head down hill to explore Machu Picchu itself - made even more magical if you have a knowledgeable guide who can bring it all to life.  The tour experience: The trek was made so much easier by the amazing support we had from our guides and porters. You're woken by the porters with a bowl of hot water to wash and a cup of cocoa leaf tea. They set up and take down camp every day, leaving after you, speeding past you up the path and getting the lunch tent and camp ready for you by the time you arrive. They carry 6kg of your kit including your thermarest and sleeping bag which you'll find ready for you in your tent by the time you get to camp on a night. At lunch and dinner you're always greeted with a round of applause (no matter how long it takes you), a cup of squash and a bowl of water to wash in. There was always enough water ready for us all to refill our bottles each morning. They were all just brilliant. The food was always good, normally porridge or pancakes for breakfast with 3 courses for lunch and dinner, normally including soup, chicken or fish, rice or potato, with a cake or jelly for dessert. You'll also get a snack for while your trekking - fruit, sweets, granola type bar and chocolate - and then afternoon tea back in camp with popcorn, crackers and hot chocolate. We even had a birthday cake on the last night for one of our girls. I think we all agreed it was some of the best food we had on our whole trip! Things to take: - Cocoa leaves and sucky sweets to help with any altitude sickness- Gateraid and re-hydration sachets - especially useful if the altitude effects your appetite- Hydration pack - I used water bottles but had serious envy of those who'd taken their hydration packs as it was just so much easier! - Sun cream - put it on, reapply and don't forget your hands and your heads! - Ipod - music really helped me get through the hardest parts - a travel pillow - might seem like a bit of a luxury item but if it helps you sleep each night all the better - thermals to sleep in and change into on a night in camp- Chocolate or sweet treats as a pick you up- Easily removable layers for when you're walking- Sunglasses and a sunhat- Camera - I wish I taken a photo every time I'd stopped as on reflection I hardly took anyPrepare yourself for....- camping - get ready to rough it although you do feel quite spoiled by the porters, - the bathrooms - not great, prepare for the worst when you go in and you'll be fine!- Inca flat - we soon learnt when our guides referred sections as Inca flat they basically meant just not as steep incline decline as before! - Machu Picchu non trekkers - you might feel slightly cheated that even though its only 8am there's already loads of tourists wandering around clean and fresh having caught the bus up first thing that morning. I think most of our group scowled at a few as they looked at our dishevelled, sweaty selves passing them on the path :) I really hope if you walk the Inca trail you enjoy as much as I did. It's an amazing experience so enjoy the views and if at any point you don't know if you can do it just stop, have a drink, catch your breath and then keep going - trust me it's worth it! :)"

But our tour company G Adventure had organised everything perfectly and our guides were amazing - Johan and Heber. It was really tough walking (for me), I was pleased I'd done some gym training prior and had those magic blister plasters, also that we'd hired poles. But it was the most magical thing I've ever done and it wll stay with me always. The sights, views, people, whole experience cannot be beated in my opinion. Do it!"

            "review": "A very rewarding challenge....amazing sceneries.... We did the 4 day trek, and we used GAdventures as provider - which we will never regret. My wife and I (41 & 44 years old) prepared ourselves physically a bit before we left Argentina, which I can recommend to everybody. The Inca Trail is for all who carry the will to suffer a bit, before the BIG REWARD is paid out = everybody with no problems with legs, hips or knees can do it. We only saw 4 people turning back during our trek, but we also saw a cool couple in their late 60\u00b4ies finishing with style.The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is the best choice, as you will be in the middle of wonderful mountains offering you stunning views, spectacular ruins, etc. - which will lead to a lot of great pictures. The actual trek is impressive, as in how the Incas were able to construct this path to cross the mountains. You will over and over again think to yourself, that it is almost surreal how they could make the trail and the buildings in the mountains back in those time. In other words it is: Fantastic.Day 1: Not challenging, and about 6 hours.Day 2: VERY challenging, the toughest day. About 9-10 hours. First 6 hours UP UP UP UP UP!!!!Day 3: The longest day, about 11 hours. The final 4-5 hours DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN!!!Day 4: Very short. Up very early, 4. am, to be in the line for the \"entrence\". About 3 hoursOBS: If you have problems with your knees, etc. then take into account that it is stairs the whole 2. day and a lot of the 3. day!!! Use walking sticks.If you are the type of traveler, who want to give something before you recieve, then the Inca Trail is a good choice. I will list some items which could be considered before booking the trek.- Willpower is the most important to bring, as it is not a walk in the park.- Book the tour months before you actually are doing the trip. We met people who wanted to do it, but couldn\u00b4t because the limit of people were reached. Only 500 people are allowed to be in the Inca Trail per day, including porters, etc. = about 250 tourists.- Prepare yourself a bit physically before you leave home, it will pay off.- Bring clothes for all situations, even the \"dry season\" can be with rain and snow.- Besides all the recommended, bring: Flip-flops, extra batteries for the cameras, head-light.- You can buy drinks, snacks, etc. several places during the trek = don\u00b4t need to bring before trek- IF the company offers you walking sticks = YES, even if you have to pay a small fee.- To keep the amount of kilos as less as possible, evaluate what you bring. - MAX.: 6 kilos pr. porter- Boots or shoes, what is the best for you no big difference. Make sure they are well used before.- As it is cold during the night, the lifetime of batteries are less than usual. Remove from cams. and put them close to the body while you sleep. You can\u00b4t recharge batteries during the trek.- DO your own pace - even if you are the last in the group.It is one of the best treks I have made in my time, and I can recommend it to everybody who wants to do it. Besides that I recommend to do the trek in the months of: June, July or August."

We (two adults, aged 40 and 49) both found this to be one of the most awesome things we've ever done. Physically demanding, but it felt great, the scenery and landscape must be experienced. Llama Path was really awesome, I think that had a lot to do with our great experience. There were 6 other adults on our trip (in their 20s and 30s) and one 12 year old; everyone did very well on the trip. Recommendations:1. take Diamox, why risk it2. use trekking poles, really3. hire the porter to carry your sleeping bag and other stuff you don't need for your hike, it's worth it4. we were super glad of having done lots of cardio before coming to Peru, and then in thew days before the trek going to the Inca sites and climbing the stairs and up the higher points. A couple days of that really made a difference.5. waterproof sandals, not just for changing into at the end of the day but you don't want to go into the \"bathrooms\" without them6. bring lots of baby wipes to make up for the showers you aren't taking7. don't look at the \"bathrooms\"; bring lots of toilet paper and a bucket of hand sanitizer8. no need to carry binoculars, very little use for them and they are heavy9. the sun is very bright and creeps right over your sunglasses; a wide-brimmed hat is a must."

            "review": "Inca Trail to Machu Picchu - 4D3N. If you love the outdoors and exercise, I highly recommend this trek! It is not easy which makes the rewards even more amazing! It is the trip of a lifetime!My husband and I are 41. We trained for this hike. I work out 3-4 times per week regardless but I ramped it up to much harder workouts, and he basically started from scratch - for 4 months. The only altitude practice we got was hiking Half Dome. I recommend this trek for almost any age! No matter what your heart will pound and you will be out of breath at that altitude. The key is to go slow. The altitude has unpredictable effects; you feel it! For 20 somethings, it is easiest. For 30 somethings, you might have to work at it. Past that, you really should train! Over 50 - it depends on the person. We had a 60 year old lady on our hike. I do not think she trained at all. She said she runs all day on her nursing job. She was crushed when the 1st day - the \"easy\" day - was so hard for her. The guide and porters carried all of her equipment and daypack (for a fee) -- but she made it! Rent as much equipment as you can, and hire a porter to carry 9kg (the sleeping bag and sleeping pad alone are 4kg). When the equipment is rented, you do not need to worry about it on the last day - nor do you need to drag it all over Peru. Our company had nice equipment; the sleeping bag was very warm and had a liner. Take your time on the hike. If you hurry, you will miss details. There is no reason to get there fast because you always have to wait for your group to catch up, and there is nothing to do at camp - the trail is better. I ended up carrying both daypacks = 22 pounds. The weight didn't bother me because I went slowly. However, the weight did cause me to plan each step more carefully.I was worried about freezing when the sun went down. I am always freezing (below 70 degrees Fahrenheit). But I was not cold at night, or ever. I never even wore my jacket. Layers are the key! My layers throughout the day: a sports bra, t-shirt, long sleeve light weight shirt, fleece, hat, and gloves. I did not use the thick rain jacket (it rained only at night for us). It was warm in the dining tent and the sleeping bag. No matter what bring hiking boots. The trail is completely uneven at all times and slippery even when it is dry. There can be a heavy rain on any given day, even in the dry season; I cannot imagine navigating that trail when it is wet!! We had no idea we should bring a garbage bag so we bought one along the way. You need it to keep your stuff dry in case of rain. You put all of your belongings (including the rented sleeping bag) in the bag, and then put the bag in the duffle bag. You are provided a duffle bag if you hired a porter. You can buy drinks (beer, water and gatorade 9-12 soles each) at several places on the first day, and one place on the 2nd morning. That is all. The bar and store located at Winay Wayna (the last night) were shut down by the government this year. The company provides plenty of water for the trail (days 2-4) and drinks during meals. Make sure you drink plenty of liquids or the effects of the high altitude will be exaggerated. The bugs were not bad at all - for us. We brought 95% deet and only used it at camp on the second night. (Careful of aerosol cans because airlines like Star Peru do not allow it - not even in your checked luggage.) We met some guys who did the Salcantay trail and they were covered with bites!!The Quechua way is to share. Plan to share with the porters - coca leaves, bug spray, etc. Buy coca leaves! They seem to be the wonder \"drug\". I'm not sure how exactly I was affected by them because you don't \"feel\" something - like you do with caffeine. Don't bother with coca candy unless you like to suck on something; it has no effect. Our company supplied snacks on 3 of the 4 days but also recommended to bring them. I had granola bars and fruit bars but wish I had a loose bag of nuts or trail mix or dried fruit - so I could eat a few pieces at a time. With all the food the company provides, you will not go hungry (or lose weight).Wear 2 pairs of socks - to prevent blisters, especially on downhills. Don't forget to cut your toenails before the trek; clip fingernails short too or they will break anyway. Bring a dry shirt to change into after finishing day 1 and 2. You finish high up; it is windy and it gets cold when the sun goes down; don't stay in your wet clothes. You can hang your wet shirt on your daypack to dry when you hike - like the porters do. The porters are always running by. Stop on the mountain side to let them pass. Do not get close to the local's donkeys on the 1st day; they can kick very hard!For our trip the showers on the last day were cold water only - and free. Bring one-use, travel-size shower supplies - stores in Cusco sell them. There was also one shower stall on nights 1 and 2 but all the camps and bathrooms are different. Every morning and evening the porters provide a dog bowl size of warm water to freshen up with. A wash bowl and trash bag were also provided at the dining tent. Bring wipes and a small towel. Do not forget a decent head lamp (not flashlight) and spare batteries. This is your only light source in your tent, the bathroom, and early the last morning. 99% of the toilets are a hole in the ground. Do not forget your toilet paper and hand sanitizer. There are some toilets along the trail and at the camp - or your company will bring a toilet tent. When there is not a wastebasket in the stall, you have to throw your used TP in the corner (sounds gross but don't flush it).Always keep your tent zipped so you don't get any unwanted creatures. There were llamas along the way: the morning of day 2, the Intipata ruins before Winay Wayna, and around Machu Picchu. In advance I was very confused about how much to tip the porters. Our company told us $40 total, and reassured me such in an email. However my guide confided different (higher) amounts. We had 10 porters, 1 cook and 1 coordinator. The 9 of us each tipped a total of 100 soles ($40) for the porters. The total breakout was 600 soles for 10 porters (so 60 each - which they divide out), 180 for the cook, and 120 for the coordinator. We pooled our tips together and gave them at the goodbye/ thank you ceremony on the last night. As for the guides... 1 guide is required for every 8 trekkers. Since we had 9 trekkers we had 2 guides (which was great because one always led the group and one always stayed behind the last person). We tipped the guides on the last day - after Machu Picchu. (Our guides did not return on the train with us; they took the much cheaper local's train.) We chose to tip the guides equally 25 soles per person each guide. Then we had an additional tip: one of our porters met us at Machu Picchu. Note - porters are not allowed past the Winay Wayna check point into Machu Picchu, so our porter had to walk down to Aguas Calientes and then up to Machu Picchu. He delivered our personal supplies (duffle bags) to Aguas Calientes. (Our rented sleeping bags and provided sleeping mats were taken from us at the last camp.) He brought us breakfast #2 to Machu Picchu, and took our rented poles (no poles allowed in Machu Picchu). Our provided duffle bag was taken from us in Aguas Calientes but we could use it til Cusco, if needed. Lastly, he met us at the bus and took us to the meeting point in Aguas Calientes. For all this we only tipped him 3 soles each. So my total tip was 153 ($61). I wouldn't plan on tipping less than this!I cannot say whether or not to bring hiking poles. I have never used them, did not use them, and did not miss them. However most others swore by how useful they are!Our guide always carried oxygen and a first aid kit. If you get ill before the top of Dead Woman's Peak, a guide or porter will return back down with you, and you can take the train to Machu Picchu (at your expense). If you get ill after Dead Woman's Peak, you will be brought to the finish. One lady we met developed tremendous knee pain so hired a guide along the way \u2013 to carry her daypack, and potentially her as well.The last morning you get up at 3:30am (or earlier) because the porters have to run down to their 5am local train; they have to pack up your tent before they can leave. We had breakfast and then walked to the checkpoint that was in the camp (Winay Wayna). At 4:00am we sat and waited for it to open at 5:30am. (This check point stops people from entering Machu Picchu when it is closed.) Technically at least 250 hikers will be in this line. The first ~50 will get to sit on a covered bench; the rest get the ground (we got the ground).From the check point it is about 1 hour to the Sun Gate where you get your first view of Machu Picchu. The trail is narrow and does not allow for easy passing. Then you hike down 30 minutes to Machu Picchu and the classic view. At that point you walk to the nearby entrance/exit to officially enter with your ticket. The entrance is where there is a normal bathroom (1 sol), food, storage (fee) and hotel - none of these are inside the sanctuary. You will not be the first person into Machu Picchu; it opens at 6am and you cannot reach it from the checkpoint much before 7am. On your way out of Machu Picchu, don't forget to stamp your passport (on the right, before the exit).  WHAT YOU NEED ON THE INCA TRAIL:Original passport, Sleeping bag and poles (not included), Hiking waterproof boots, Thick plastic rain poncho (Remember: Even during the dry season there can be the occasional heavy downpour), Warm jacket, hat, gloves and wool socks, Extra set of <dry> clothes for the night/PJs, Sun hat and sunglasses, 2 T-shirts / 2 long-sleeve shirts, Comfortable hiking <zip off> trousers, Socks, underwear, Water bottle/bladder, Toilet paper and lots of wet wipes, Hand sanitizer, Personal medication, bandaids, Headache, antacid medicines, Diarrhea and constipation medicines, Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, hair gel, Flashlight/headlamp with spare batteries, Money for tipping and for any emergency (local currency) = 300 sols pp, Sport Bra, Sunscreen, Insect Repellent, Large garbage bag, Daypack.

The hike itself was so memorable, and the landscape was extremely gorgeous. But, I won't lie, hiking ~28 miles over 4 days at altitudes that ranged from ~8000 ft to ~13800 ft was one of the toughest things I've ever had to do. But it was so worthwhile! Don't let age deter you, My wife and I are in our early 30s, but there were others in our trek group in their 40's 50s, and one that was 71! Physically, it's very doable especially if you enjoy hiking and roughing i in the outdoors. Part of having a good experience is being prepared - bring bug repellant as you'll definitely need it at lower altitudes. Also, bring a poncho as it actually hailed and rained on day 2-3 of our hike when we were at the highest altitudes. On the morning of the 4th day when you walk into Machupicchu...seeing MP for the first time and the feeling of accomplishment you get for completing the hike is just phenomenal!"

Myself & my partner had been planning our trip to Peru since the end of 2011 and simply couldn't wait until the Inca TrekWe did the 4 days/3 night tour and loved every moment of it!! We picked SAS to go with - mainly from recommendations from friends and we were not disappointed!! The hard work the porters do can not be described in words - they are simply amazing men. The food on the trip was top class - each meal topping the last one! And plenty for everyone. But I would also recommend to bring along some snacks as there can be a few hours between meals and with all the trekking - you'll need to keep energy levels up. The trekking itself - if you are reasonably fit but don't trek much - hire a porter to carry your sleeping bag, and some clothes etc. We aren't very experienced hikers (few day climbs but that's it) so hiring a porter to carry a few items was one of our better decisions. The climbing was tough going but at no point did we ever feel exhausted or feel like we couldn't go on - climb at your own pace and you'll be fine. Make sure to pack plenty of toilet paper and insect repellent. SAS tour group were amazing and the knowledge the tour guides provided on the scenery and ruins was an education in itself. Also if you are up for it on the last day or even have time the next day - I would highly recommend taking the trip up Huayna Picchu (Wayna Picchu) - while it is a lot steeper than anything on the Inca Trek, a bit of rock climbing in parts - the view from the top is totally worth it."

Our guide Romero was fantastic as were all the porters and the cook made us delicious hot meals 3x a day. I had quite a bit of components to my trip, ie, transferring of luggage, drivers needed pre & post trek and everything went beautifully. The trail itself is amazing and anyone considering it should do it!!!! Although it is not an easy hike, anyone in reasonably good shape can do it. And I would highly recommend Inca Reservation to set this up. I can't say enough words in the space to express how helpful and organized they were."

To me, sounds like none has ever hiked. All complain that it is cold(14000 ft) and the toilets stink(ever been to a toilet ten miles from the trailhead that doesnt?). So this is my offer; you tell me youre questions on this hike, and if I make it the whole way, I'll answer all I can."

            "review": "An amazing hike!. We used SAS Travel for our Inca Trail hike, and I cannot emphasize how much we loved this company. The initial reason we chose them was because they are a local company and they keep the money local. We did not realize at the time how much better an experience we would have because of the guides and the porters (chaskies) from this company. They were amazingly knowledgeable, very interested and passionate about sharing Inca culture and history, extremely helpful all along the trail, and very good at helping 14 strangers bond and get to know each other. They also showed their chaskies (and all the chaskies on the trail, really) great respect and encouraged us to as well. The chaskies were truly awe-inspiring to me. Everyday, they would wake us up, serve us breakfast, wait for us to head onto the trail, then break down camp, pass us on the trail, and set up for lunch long before we got there. The same process occurred after lunch, where they would clean up and reach our campsite for the night and have tents set up before we arrived. The other thing I loved about SAS Travel was that the meals we were served were so much better than I ever expected. A wide variety of foods at every meal, and much of it very healthy. I was always surprised by how much I ate at almost every meal, but hiking the trail like that, you work harder than you might think. It's nice to have a nice meal to sit down to in the mornings and for lunch and dinner. As for the trail itself, it wound for the first day or so through a number of small villages, so it gave me a glimpse of what daily life is like for the people that live there. We also pass near a number of ruins, and it's nice to be able to explore them a little bit without a big crowd of people. Most of the time on the trail, you see the same folks from other groups that started the same day as you, but it never feels crowded until the last morning when you arrive at the Sun Gate and enter Machu Picchu. The views throughout are amazing, and the trail passes through a variety of different ecotypes. I never did see any wildlife on the trail, though (although we were warned of bushmaster snakes and large spiders as we entered the high jungle or cloud forest). Lots of llamas, some donkeys and horses was about it. There are some very difficult sections of the trail, for me it was the long and steep uphill climb to Dead Woman's Pass, the highest point on the trail. Lots of steps both descending and ascending along the trail caused some issues for hikers with knee or hip problems. I mostly had issues with the much-reduced oxygen level at such high elevations (4100+ m).The part I didn't like was the toilet situation. The pit toilets along the trail (at some lunch sites and all campsites) mostly had flushing mechanisms and a porcelain hole in the floor. Especially at campsites, they could get pretty disgusting, and some people in our group chose to go outside in the woods instead. There were also a lot of areas along the trail where people were stopping in the brush and often left toilet paper just sitting there on the ground. In the rainy season, maybe this washes away quickly, but it got kind of disgusting when we were there because no one was burying their waste. The only other negative might be that the Peruvian government does not limit the number of visitors per day to Machu Picchu, just the number of hikers on the Inca Trail. This means that a very large number of people take the bus up from Agues Calientes everyday, and Machu Picchu becomes a zoo by mid-day. The first couple of hours after we arrived from the trail were nice, but as the day went on, it got very crowded, and it was hard to really enjoy being there in all that chaos. Overall, I highly recommend the hike to get to Machu Picchu over taking a train to Agues Calientes and then a bus up the hill to Machu Picchu. Well worth what you get out of it. I learned so much on the trail about the Incas and about myself, and I met so many great people I never would have talked to otherwise, that I wouldn't trade it for anything!"

The landscapes are incredibly beautiful and stunning. Even though the second day was the most difficult if the trekking, we got until the higgest point of the excursion : The Dead Woman past. In short, we enjoyed and had a lot a fun doing one of the most wonderful trekking in the world. The camps were excellent, hight tech, and warm as well as the food. "

It is the first tour guide, I have ever had that I genuinely thought was very well read and knowledgeable about the tour. The hike itself is somewhat tough. I did it with my wife and we carried our own pack (in other words, we did not use a porter). Somewhat suprisingly, we were the only people on our trip that did not use a porter. In the grand scheme, a porter is not very expensive and it would make the hiking a bit easier. We decided not to use one because we wanted a more \"genuine\" hiking experience. One word of advice on gear, even if you don't usually hike with poles, this is a good place to use them. Not only does the hiking involve 1 and 2 hour stretches of somewhat steep uphill hiking at altitude, but the decents (because of the nature of the rock steps on the Inca Trail) can be somewhat treacherous. As for the hike, what can I say. Not only is it unbelievable cool to hike past ancient Incan ruins, but both my wife and I were surprised by how beautiful the landscape was along the hike. You go through various types of ecosystems and the scenery changes a lot. Finally, it ends at Macchu Picchu, which is not too shabby. If you can do this (finacially and/or physically) I would highly reccommend it. One last word on llama path, this may be the case for all the tours, but I can only speak about ours--the food was very good. I don't mean good for hiking food, I mean good for food anywhere. I don't know how they are able to do it, but I am somewhat spoiled for my next hiking trip."

There are many ways to prepare, get fit, go on a practice hike, wear in your boots, however, I recommend trying to spend more than two days in a high altitude environment. Although everyone is different, I spent a month in altitude before the hike and didn't experience the side effects. However, my friends use coca leaves (available in Cusco) and prescription travel medicine to manage their altitude sickness (available from doctor). Hiking poles for even the experienced hiker are advantageous. They can be hired through your tour agency or purchased before you start hiking. If you are a female travelling on your own and don't want to share a tent with an unknown male, be sure to advise your tour agency in advance. I also recommend using the services of a porter, 15kgs feels much heavier at altitude. Once you make it to Macchu Picchu, you can hike Huayna Picchu. Like the Inca Trail, you need to purchase a ticket in advance and it is extremely strenuous, I would not recommend this hike to young children, people who are afraid of heights or those who are unfit. This was a trip of a lifetime."

We did the 4 day 4 night option, which is 4 days/ 3 nights on the trail, with an optional additional night in Aguas Calientes. Our guides were Fred and Edwin. Fred has a masters in archaeology, and he did an excellent job of explaining each ruin and related Inca culture. My son started having problems the first day, and Edwin carried my son's pack for most of the trip (and got a nice tip!). Fred and Edwin did whatever it took to keep everyone happy. The food was quite good, and the equipment was generally satisfactory. The sleeping pads were not adequate, and the zipper on my son's sleeping bad didn't work, but otherwise we were ok with the equipment. The only real complaint I have is that we had 14 people in our group -- we all got along well, and enjoyed each other's company, but a smaller group would have been better. The porters and cooks were treated with respect, and they had uniforms and decent footwear. SAS also did a nice job arranging hotels, and arranged a very nice tour of the Sacred Valley for us. Another nice thing about SAS is that they are a fairly big outfit, and own their own hotels, buses and equipment. They handled everything themselves and did not sucontract their services to anyone. We were very satisfied with SAS, and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone."

Trek organised by \u2018Intrepid\u2019 Melbourne:The trekking:Day 1 was mostly ups then downhills in short spurts - manageable for most people.Day 2 was very hard going. We have 2 'passes' to clear consisting of 2 never-ending uphill climbs that tighten the calves and 2 long downhills that test the knee joints. Reached the highest point of trek at 4200m - no sickness - relief! Some how we make it \u2013 exhausted! Day 3 - although the body is aching in many places by this point it seemed like a breeze as was much more flat or moderate hills and only increased by 200m from day before.Day 4 - pressure from behind from the many other trekkers making the final 2 hrs or so to the Sun Gate and beyond to Machu Picchu. Due to the early rise and chaotic disorganisation, this was testing. Walking much quicker with fools trying to overtake as if Machu Picchu will disappear after sunrise. Wettest day of the trek also \u2013 poncho in effect \u2013 very muddy under foot. A tiring but ultimately rewarding day.Our guideOur guide was a nice guy for the most part, liked to joke a lot in the Australian vernacular, and is very knowledgeable in the ways of Inca. For us, things soured a little with him as time went on as he sometimes gave confusing explanations or instructions and the many rules and schedules to follow became a bit tiring. The most disappointing thing was when one of us \u2013 a female \u2013 was feeling ill but was told basically there was no time for me to attend to her as we had to get moving. This was on the final morning which was a particularly early rise at around 4am which we were told was due to the need for making the final leg to Machu Picchu in time for sunrise but in reality was due to the need for the porters to pack up in time for their early train back home at around 6am \u2013 apparently there is only this one and another in the evening.We understood these restraints but someone\u2019s well-being should always take precedence \u2013 thankfully the sickness was not serious and it passed and we were able to enjoy the day at Machu Picchu. The porters: Two words: hard + work! These guys worked tirelessly the whole trek to run ahead with the gear (reportedly with up to 60kgs each), cook, clean, and prepare/packup tents amongst other things. Mostly farmers by trade, we had 11 guys in total for just the 5 groupmembers. Their ages ranged from 20 to 48 with some porters apparently working into their 60's. The calf muscles on these guys could kill! Such difficult and sweaty work. Very quiet and unassuming fellows, we had a shared afternoon tea with them on day 3 much to the surprise of the neighbouring groups as this is apparently unheard of as the porters usually stay behind the scenes. They loosened up as time went on and were in good spirits listening to a football match involving Lima.The food:Was surprisingly good all in all. We half expected tinned rations and were surprised by the quality and variety (although this also tapered off a bit towards the end). Highlights included pancakes, popcorn, soups (great at lunch) avocado, various beef and chicken dishes and local vegies like sweet potato, a selection of teas (served at your tent door upon wakeup call), and the grain substance \u2018quinoa\u2019 (pronounced keen-wah) once called \u201cthe gold of the Incas\u201d for increasing the stamina of Incan warriors.The camping: Decent though smallish double tents with tarp underlay and 2 inch camping mats - constructing a makeshift pillow was not always a great success - stiff neck but not too bad. Fixed camping spots with other groups surrounding our tents and the dining tent always ready upon arrival although our situation at camp was not always the best - donkeys chewing near the tent at dawn day 2, a mile away from the toilets night 2, then nearly swimming in it night 3 (fun smells). It was not easy to get ready in the short time allowed before breakfast particularly. The 'facilities' were the expected hole in the ground affairs which ranged from offensive to nightmarish. Still, somehow this was preferable to having to go 'bush' in out of the way parts of the trek as there was fewer rest areas the further we progressed. All part of the experience ofcourse!Machu Picchu:After the chaotic morning we set off for the sun gate \u2013 dealing with the annoying over-takers was a pain at times. The Sun Gate was very crowded and it was raining so thus hard to protect the camera whilst taking photos. People are just plain rude! The fog was heavily set in but cleared at points \u2013 we all felt a little disappointed having trekked so far. The further we got down to the site though the better pics we got. We took our time as we made our way down the mountain. The site is even more spectacular than the postcards. Guide did a 90 min talking tour which was actually pretty informative. Many much cleaner 'tourists' in groups and walking into our photos as expected \u2013 still we suffered these less worthy souls and all came away with great snaps and a great sense of accomplishment (agreed one of the toughest things we\u2019ve ever done). A short bus ride and farewell lunch at an intrepid designated restaurant in Machu Picchu town (the guides get their free meal you see) \u2013 we all reminisce and had a big plate of burgers and chips plus oddly our first ever Pisco Sour (yum but strong!)."

            "review": "Must Do!!!. A trek of this nature was a first time for me. My partner and I were not even really fit and yet we both do agree that it was a must-do experience. We had loads of questions before we went, so I hope this helps:Packing:Try to keep as little as possible with you and we really recommend getting a porter as it allows you a little freedom to enjoy the trek. Generally you repeat your outerwear and just change your innerwear daily. If you are susceptible to altitude sickness [generally the younger and more fit people are susceptible to this as their body is used to getting more oxygen into their blood] then definitely buy dried coca leaves in Cusco before you start the trek as you can chew on this while hiking. We also purchased altitude sickness tablets in Lima - Sarojchi. Wet wipes and toilet paper is a must. Lots of people on the trek really struggled with insect repellant, I personally was fine, but definitely carry some kind bug spray and hand sanitiser. Clothing - we went in July when it was dry season and only had a very slight drizzle one evening but it was cold in the mornings [especially the second morning and second night]. Dressing in layers works the best, taking out the jacket, scarves and gloves as the day progresses.Gear:We hired everything from the tour operator and found their equipment to be in good condition. We just took a sleeping liner with us for the sleeping bags. Other people on the trek did hire the inflatable mattresses which was nice but not necessary. If you are very tall, perhaps consider taking your own sleeping bag as we just fitted in ours and know that the taller people in the group did struggle. Perhaps bring it to your tour operators attention when booking to make sure you are catered for. I would definitely recommend walking sticks as parts of the trail are very uneven.Fitness:We didn't train and did make it through the entire journey even though we were always at the back of the group. The second day is the hardest as its a continuous uphill with a very steep descent. Its also the day you reach the highest point of the trail and thus most are prone to altitude sickness on this day.Trail:Overall the trail is fairly well maintained and campsites are as expected, neat but the toilets are a huge issue and thus prepare for that.First day - is a generally even ascent and fairly good.Second day - this is the most difficult day going up dead womens pass, so just mentally prepare yourself as the immediate descent from there was tough on the legs [in fact I think it was harder to go down that up as you have to be very careful]. Once you pass this its another uphill to another inca site - if you are wary of heights, do note this stage as parts of the trail going forward from this point on are fairly close to drops. I found this a little disconcerting myself. However the views are unparralled as I felt as if I was on top of the world.Third day - was an easy day of just about 5 hours of trekking and we reached our campsite at lunch time. Check with your operator as to the plan for the trek. Our guide really pushed us for the first two days and then we took it easy on the third day which was nice.Fourth day - a very early start and its a mad rush from start to end as everyone wants to be the first to get to the sun gate. Also once there, and you get to MP, the crowds are quite crazy as there are loads of daytrippers.Food:Do not even stress - our group and the others I saw all had amazing food.Water:no one in my group had an issue. For the first morning you do need your own water, but from lunch onwards [until the end of the trek] you are provided with water. We had boiled water daily at meals and on the trek, and no one had any health issues. Take water purification tablets with you if you are nervous about this."

They do different packages but ours included a night in Lima, flight to Cusco, day tour of Cusco with our guide, night in Cusco, Sacred Valley tour and night in hotel before starting the Inca Trail with 3 nights camping, 4 days trekking and finishing with a night in Cusco. The company really looked after you well. There were fourteen in our group and with us we had 20 porters, 2 cooks and 2 guides. While we were trekking all day, the porters and cooks would walk faster and have the tents set up, food tent set up and a 3 course meal cooked by the time we arrived. It's an expensive tour but well worth it, food is great and you spend very little extra. The Inca Trail was an incredible experience, beautiful fews and walks, good craic. The trek is tiring at times and you need too be fit enough but its so worth it. Its 45km in total, at high altitude with up to 7hours steep walking each day but when ypu reach Macchu Picchu watching the sunrise on your last day, the ffeling is incredible! A highlight of our SA trip."

There are many easier ways to reach Machu Picchu but the four day trek is definitely the correct way to do it - if you are physically capable! I cannot say enough great things about SAS. Our guides, Fred and Reynaldo, were absolutely fantastic. We learned so much about the Incas, archeology and astronomy. They were also very attentive and helpful in making sure that everyone in our group was able to make it to Machu Picchu! The only thing I disliked was the condition of the facilities. This is the fault of the Peruvian government. Based on the limits of people allowed to be on the trail each day, they could certainly charge a little more and pay people to make sure that the toilet facilities are clean."

There are probably more than enough reviews for you to know that this is the only way to truly take in the magnificence of Machu Picchu and its environs. If you are physically able, you owe it to yourself to do this. My son and I did the short Inca trail which entails about 21 km (13 miles) of hiking in a day followed by a next day tour of Machu Picchu itself. Please believe me there is no better way to see Machu Picchu for the first time, then to gaze down on it from the Sun Gate, and since you only get one first time for anything in life make each one the best you can.It\u2019s important to be aware of - and I never found this in any previous review - that although the listed elevation gain is about 1,800 ft, there is a lot of up and down so you will actually climb up and down about twice that (maybe more?), but if you train you can do it. We used Apus Peru (Please see my review of them under tour operators), and I HIGHLY recommend them because they will do everything possible to help you succeed and make it a truly memorable adventure. Their philosophy is that it\u2019s an experience to be savored and NOT a race to be rushed through."

Because I was well acclimatized, as I came from an even higher elevation, I found the trek/terrain to be easy and enjoyable. The absolute key here being that I was properly acclimated for three weeks before I arrived in Cusco. The trail meanders through varying vegetation zones and there are a number of very cool ruins along the way, making for an enjoyable journey. I have been lucky enough to trek, hike, and climb all over this beautiful planet of ours, and I can confidently say that the Inca Trail was one of the most beautiful trails I have been on. I highly recommend it, and I would do it again in a heartbeat!"

There seem to be a few questions that most people are wondering about. Here are a few short answers to some of them:How tough is it?It is basically up to you. It is quite tough if you try to keep up with the porters. There are still some parts that are tough even if you take it slowly, but you have a lot of time so it's not a huge problem. I would say that you can do it and enjoy it as long as you are not completely unfit or injured. I saw small kids and people older than 70 years old on the trail. What about altitude sickness?It is strongly recommended that you spend some time at a high altitude to get accustomed to it, before you start the Inca Trail. We spent two nights in Cusco, which was enough. Less than that is a big gamble. You might be lucky and not have any problems, but why gamble?What clothes should I bring?Obviously this changes depending on when you are going. But it can get quite warm during the day when you are walking, but it does get cold during the night. So bring a lot of layers and adjust all through the day. I had a thermal shirt closest to the body and then just adjusted what I had on top. This worked really well for me.How important is it to find the right company?I actually think it's important to not find the wrong company. Most companies seem very good, but there are a few that are pretty bad. We went with Camping Tours and we were extremely happy with them.How is the food?Excellent! However, this is one of the things that varies between the different companies. The food is generally very good. You get two or three courses with every meal with most companies! And it is all really tasty! It is really impressive considering that the porters have to carry everything.I have a blog where I have written more about what you actually experience during the different days of the Inca Trail. You can also find quite a few pictures of what to expect:Day 1:http://enjoyingbrazil.blogspot.com/2012/06/inka-trail-day-1.htmlDay 2:http://enjoyingbrazil.blogspot.com/2012/06/inka-trail-day-2.htmlDay 3:http://enjoyingbrazil.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-inka-trail-day-3.htmlDay 4:http://enjoyingbrazil.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-inka-trail-day-4-machu-picchu.htmlWayna Picchu (optional):http://enjoyingbrazil.blogspot.com/2012/08/wayna-picchu-or-huayna-picchu.html"

It was much more difficult than I thought it would be, but it is something I will never forget. The stone path and steps are very steep and you are often on the edge of a sharp drop. Anyone in decent shape would be able to complete the climb, but make sure you are a working out and used to exercise before the trip. My friends and I run marathons and we often stopped to catch our breath due to altitude and steep climbs.It was also colder than I expected (this was end of July/August 2012). It was quite cold at evenings and in the AM, so the llama gloves, hat and sweater I bought in the Plaza de Armas were well used. During the day some people wore shorts, but long pants and long sleeves that I could roll us were enough.. you get warm when hiking!!For our trek we used Llama Path travel agency and did the 4 day/3 night comfort tour. I would recommend them 100%. Our tour guides, Irving and Miguel, were incredibly knowledgeable. The food provided was very good (but I would recommend claiming you are vegetarian as 2 people may have gotten food poisoning) and the tents were always prepped and ready for the night when we arrived at campsite. I carried my own pack, but if you are not in good shape, I would just save the trouble and hire an extra porter. Doing it again, I would choose this option just out of sheer want to be able to look around more and not worry about carrying my pack or where to put it when going to the bathroom. Llama Path also did our city tour of Cuzco, picked us up from the airport and arranged our travel back from Machu Piccu by train/bus and then dropped us back off at our Cuzco hotel."

We chose to do a longer version of the trek, the first three days on the Salkantay trek and joining the Inca Trail on the fourth. This took us to some beautiful valleys and over a nearly 5000 metre pass with close-up views of the peak Salkantay, and we were almost the only people there. We then joined the Inca Trail proper for days four to seven, and were a half day ahead of the 500 people who set out from Cusco, so we had peaceful walking, quiet campsites and clean bathrooms for almost the entire seven days. If you have the time, this is a great way to do it, and if you are in Peru, and you are fit, you really should do it, it is unforgettable. The scenery is spectacular and Machu Picchu itself is incomparable. Don't go into it without preparation though- there are long, steep climbs, high steps and the air is thin. We got great service from Sungate Tours, they were always on time to meet us in Cusco with a modern vehicle and a good driver and their representative Doris was very sweet and friendly. On our trek we had a very knowledgeable guide, Navidad, and a great cook, Marcelino, the gear was all modern and the atmosphere in the group was always happy and cheerful. We highly recommend these guys."

Even if the time commitment prevents you from doing other things in Peru, you should absolutely chose this over those other things. I have visited many places in Peru but none gave me the life-long memories and insight into Incan and Peruvian history that the Inca Trail did. You will have the chance to see and explore multiple, isolated Inca ruins without the crowds, and with gorgeous unbroken views of the surrounding Andes. Our guides - Valentin and Eric of SAS travel - were incredible in offering information, answering questions about multiple topics, and providing a truly spiritual experience for us. Our group had a variety of abilities, but everyone had had some outdoor and hiking experience. Everyone did great, and although it was a challenge for all. Our guides did a fantastic job of adjusting to the group and providing a mix of hiking together and splitting up into the \"YoungKnees\" and the \"OldKnees.\" My dad and I carried our own packs, and were generally happy to have accepted the extra challenge. Because the porters carry so much of the camp gear, and we are used to travelling light, our packs both weighed less than 30lbs. Others who hired a porter to carry half their gear ended up carrying just as much weight as I did. We also did not regret bringing hiking poles; they are a must for the down hill sections, and helpful on the uphill ones.A note on company: SAS Travel was everything we wanted in a travel company. The helped us book our hotel stay in Cusco, the City and Sacred Valley tour, paid for our transportation to and from the airport, AND gave us the PERFECT Inca Trail experience. The porters were as well-equipped as any that we saw, and the food was consistently delicious. The guides were beyond great, and seemed to really love what they were doing."

The story goes like this, we book our trip for 6 people give our deposit and get and email back a week later saying we are short $ 250.00 a person. We email there policy about the deposit they sent an apology email stating we are right. We start to review everything and notice they do not have a confirmation for they train ride down or the hotel the night before. We email again wait a week and half this time. The reply is we need another $60.00 a person to process tickets and booking of the hotel. We emailed and tell them to put in on a credit card they confirm same day!!!! We find out when the credit card statement come they did not charge us. We email again no response, 2 weeks pass email and check the credit card again nothing for either send another email and get the sorry your trip can not happen because we forgot to get you permits for the Inca trail. They way of fixing this is an $80.00 credit towards any trip we would like to take in the last week of OCTOBER of the first week in November!!! The 80.00 does not even cover the change fee from the airline! The communication from this company is the worst. I would pay a little extra for the safety of confirmed trip!

Just wanted to give a different perspective from all of the glowing reviews.I just came off the trail today after only completing one day and night. The trip from our camp to Ollay was pretty tough - I had to walk for 2+ hours (should have taken about 1 hour) and then was on a horse with no stirrups going up and down mountains. With one 10 minute break - total time from camp to mile marker 82 was 6.25 hours then there was a 45 minute bus ride to Ollay....Just want everyone to be aware -ALTITUDE - not talking altitude sickness (hoping everyone has investigated altitude sickness drugs or at least acclimating in SV/Cusco prior to trek). I am talking about huffing and puffing uphill. The porter (albeit carrying huge loads) are huffing. It is intense trying to catch your breath.Day 1 hike - it isn't flat - it is Peru flat - you will be walking up and down hills. 10 - 20 large steps up - 30 steps flat - then 10 - 20 large steps down - repeat for hours....Peru winter - it is cold! We met at 4:30 am outside with our gear for the bus - he was 15 mihutes late - then for the 2 hours to Ollay the bus had NO HEAT - and then the breakfast place had NO HEAT AND WAS OPEN AIR. We could see our breaths. The table we all sat at was visibly shaking from our group. Obviously it was cold night 1 and it gets worse night 2 and 3.Toilets - squat toilets only at campsites and not to be gentle about it - crap all over the floors.Yes - the food does rock. The views were AMAZING. The other people in our group were diverse and interesting and really great! If you are between the age of 10 - X and in good shape (and not a smoker - altitude!) and don't mind the cold and like to sleep in tents - this is the trip for you! If you smoke or are carry way too many excess pounds and don't know what the inside of a gym looks like or hate the cold and/or camping - in MY OPINION (please don't blast me) - this might be really difficult. I had trained for months on stairs - built up to 750 up and 750 down 3+ times a week plus normal gym classes 3+ plus walking. Then I tried to get cute and tried every other step - blew out my IT band 6 weeks ago - rested / PT / coritsone shots / etc - thought I was good to go. Made it the first day - slowly - but made it - awoke at 11:30 pm in terrible pain - up all night and had to call it. Going to take the train up to meet me group - better than nothing...I hope everyone who reads this is 30 years old and in prime shape and loves the cold and camping and has a balll and gets to MP for me!!"

            "review": "Chaska Tours good for the Inca Trail. The Inca Trail is one of the most breathtaking hikes that I have ever been on. With each turn, the scenery becomes more amazing. It is a strenous hike made more so because the Incans didn't seem to believe in switchbacks. The trails go straight up and straight down via steep stairs on many of the stretches. We had eleven in our group including people of various fitness levels. The guides never showed impatience and were well-equipped to handle any emergency that may have come upon us. Luckily, we all made it, and it will be an experience we will always remember.In searching for a tour company, it was important for us to go with a local company. We had read several reviews of Chaska, and the local guides did not disappoint in their knowledge of Cusco, Sacred Valley and the Incan history. English language skills were outstanding, and we had many enjoyable times laughing together. The office administration and responsiveness to questions was good but not excellent, and I often felt like I had to follow up and find out when we would get our information. Once we arrived in Lima, however, everything worked like clockwork, and the Chaska reps were always there to pick us up and take us to all our destinations. Very well coordinated.I was very pleased with the follow up AFTER our trip to get our feedback. I indicated that the up-front organization of the trip could have been better and Chaska informed me that they had just hired a new person for their office to improve this. They were also interested in what our definition of excellent response time was, so I commend them for that.All in all, I would definitely recommend Chaska and feel that we have gained a few new Peruvian Facebook friends as a result of the great time we had hiking with them. Oh, and the food on the trail was absolutely amazing! I wish I could cook that well in my own kitchen."

(we were not the first but not the last in any mean). he explained a lot of ruins and flora on the way. the food was increible delicious and it is the best peruvian food I ate. don t know how the cook manage to cook so well with so little means."

But one thing I didnt hear a lot about in the other reviews. SunGate Tours was our tour group. Not great. very unorganized and not well coordinated. Some of the key people didnt speak english very well at all, breaking down communications. The tents we had on the train, leaked water and it rained all 3 nights. Fun! The food was good, but if you're a germaphobe like myself, its tough to swallow how they transport, store and clean everything. It's a bit nasty. I will say though, I didnt get sick from it. The porters are amazing. These guys work so hard its unreal. Bring Solos with you to tip them at the end. Try and give each Porter 100 solos each. They recommend 60, but thats not fair for what they do. The larger camp sites have \"public\" bathrooms, but beware! it reaks of sewage and if your tent is near one of the toilet area's you're screwed. I had that privelage. The final morning, you set out at 3am. Bring your headlamps! You're hiking in the dark for 2 hours. I dont know how people havent been severly hurt doing that yet. Anyway all told the pros and cons balanced out and I'm glad I went, but too much roughing it for my liking."

I am in pretty good shape but I live at sea level so for me 14 thousand feet was a bit of a headache - literally. That plus the stairs - which are amazing - makes it slow going. All in all this was the most amazing way to see Machu Picchu and the rest of the Incan temples and cities along the way. I cringe to think of all the beautiful and amazing things we would have missed out on if we had just taken the train. We traveled with SAS Travel Peru out of Cuso and they were awesome. Great guides, food, porters, camp sites, etc. You need to be prepared for actual camping - there is no running water to shower in, no electricity on the mountain, and if you go in the winter its cold in the morning and the night. Wear layers. The Andes are beautiful and this was a trip of a life time!"

Even if you train and try to prepare do know it is a hard hike due to the trail itself (the trail is full of uneven giant granite rocks) and the altitude. I would recommend lots of layers since the days begin so early and cold, but you do heat up pretty quickly. Also, bring things that will help keep you moisturized since the air so dry! (chap stick, saline drops, halls, hand lotion, ect)"

We wanted a small group with a more intimate feeling and experience. I got very quick answers to my questions from Jacquie in Virginal, USA. She is the USA contact for the company and due to this, we were able to pay via PayPal, which made the process simpler and less risky, after reading some accounts of unscrupulous and unlicensed tour operators. Jacquie answered all questions I had throughout those six months and provided very helpful insight and advice regarding the packing list. We booked this trip about six months in advance and we were able to get the starting date we wanted. Our trail guide, Juan Jose, met us at the hotel in Cusco a couple of days before we were to depart. We immediately felt at ease with his knowledge, humor and confidence. We knew we would be in good hands and he did not disappoint. Later we found out he is one of their more requested guides. We also met Vidal, the co-founder of the company in Cusco. He arranged a horseback riding trip for us as well as a side trip before our Inca Trail Adventure. He made sure we were prepared and had the right equipment. Our Inca Trail experience was incredible. We were matched with a family of four, a couple and their two young adult children. The match proved to be a great fit, as we became a family for those four days. Our most sincere gratitude to our porters and our cook. They worked so hard and were always looking out for us. We ate like royalty on the trail. We had tents with table linens, three and four course meals that were absolutely delicious. It was hard to believe that out cook, Hernan, made all that with a little portable gas grill.Back to our guide, Juan Jose\u2026he made this experience even more special. He motivated us, cheered us, instructed us and made us feel safe and confident. We joked he was like a shepherd, making sure not one of his sheep (or alpaca!) got lost, tired or demoralized. He was just one really cool and genuine guy and we loved spending time with him. The trail itself was just an incredible experience. The views are amazing and they motivate you to keep going. It was physically challenging due to the altitude and it can get really tough. The payoff was just worth it though. It is something I will treasure for the rest of my life. Adios Adventure Travel provided us with an amazing adventure tailored to our wants and needs. We saw other groups on the trail that were quite big. I doubt they received the enrichment and personal attention that we received from this Inca Trail Tour Company. Thank you Adios!"

Did the trail in 4d/3n. Guides and porters were very professional - food was good, served on time and cooking/eating areas were clean. Tents were always set up by the time we got to the campsite. Both guides were very helpful - helped carry a sleeping pad for us because we thought it was too heavy for the second day. The hike itself is very beautiful but strenuous. Hire an extra porter if you haven't done any such hike earlier. Only downside is that bathrooms are dirty. Cold showers are available on day 2 and 3."

I strongly reccommend them, they include everything with their trek so you really don\u00b4t need to add anything else on. The inflatable air mattress and the private porter who carried our belongings really are great luxuries when you are up there sweating it out on the mountain. Our guide Fabricio was great, very enthusiatic!! haha. We also did the hike up to Huayna Picchu, which offered unspoiled views of the ruins up from above. Buy some water purification tablets, these are light to carry and come in very handy. Means you wont have to carry so much water and you can fill up from the streams, which there are plenty of. We were lucky we had great weather. Highlight of the trek was the Sun Gate. Clouds came out at the right time. Magic! Food, was great. I had the Vegetarian menu. Only negative thing is the bathrooms were not great, these are communal."

I'm pretty fit but it was one of the most challenging, but also rewarding, things I've ever done. I'd recommend it to everyone. Day one is quite easy, up and down a bit but fine. Day two is a KILLER! 5 hours of uphill to cross Dead Woman's pass at 4200m. I cried, hyperventilated and struggled to breathe but eventually made it. then it's downhill to camp.Day three is lovely - nice views, stunning ruins and Machu Picchu mountain in the distance. Bit of an uphill to start, then LOADS of steps down which are very steep. But easier than going uphill!Day four is queuing for the sun gate at 4am then a speedy hike to the monkey steps - steep steps up to the sun gate. See Machu Picchu in the distance and feel elated. Walk down to it and find its full of annoying cheats who took the train :)Food is very very good - porters wake you with cocoa tea, then bread and jam and hot drinks for breakfast, lunch and dinner is 3 courses - soup, fish or chicken with rice or potato, cake or jelly for dessert. Afternoon tea is popcorn or crackers with hot choc. You also get a daily snack of banana / energy bar etc. Things to take with you:iPod to get you through the hard bits Travel pillowRehydration energy drink sachets and glucose tablets - you'll need it! Thermals for the nightBig backpack - the porters can only carry 3kg of your belongings if you need them to carry your sleeping bag and air mattress too. 20L + is goodSun cream and hatDrink pack for your bag - easier than plastic bottles. Chocolate, sweets, biscuits for snacks. People sell stuff along the way up to Dead woman's pass though.

YOu eventually get used to the altitude, and with a positive attitude people with zimmer frames can even do it! Gap adventures was amazing, our guide was fantastic... You can get some guides who talk crap about the history. Go through a reputable tour company as they also treat the porters far better.

Granted it is a great hike - but not so good if you spend the 4 days throwing up all the time! To this day I am unsure if it was altitude or a dodgy meal the day before but I have never been so ill! I have amazing photographs that someone else took for me whilst I was throwing up down the side of the hill - I remember handing my camera to one of the porters and encouraged them to have some fun with it. The porters not only took some amazing, (and at times very funny photos of each other) but they went above and beyond to drag my sorry self along the trail; keeping me fed, watered and laughing. I think what I felt was close to \"love\" by the end of the 4 days.Once I made it to the sunrise over the city, I was completely wasted but in awe. I shed a tear or two. In all honesty, I have every intention of going back to attempt the trail again. It was certainly an amazing experience that I will never forget, I can't wait to do it again with a bucket load of Gastro-stop pills :-)"

I had been living in Cusco for 5 months when I booked the Inca trail for myself, my boyfriend (we're in our 20's) and my parents (early 60's and active). We researched companies thoroughly. Colibri (also called Q'ente) had the nicest and most helpful people in their office- particularly Susana. Our guides on the trail were amazing and really knowledgeable and spoke very good English (Greco). But the most impressive part of the company were the porters and the cooks. We started each day with being brought coca leaf tea and a basin of hot water to our tent. We then had a hot breakfast. We always had hot lunches- including soup and multiple plates. Whenever we got into a camp or lunch site they had the same hot water basins waiting for us to wash up. Every evening we had \"tea time\" with snacks and tea/coffee/hot chocolate. This was followed by a three course dinner- soup, entrees (yes, plural), and dessert. The last night the chef even managed to make a cafe in a pot on a burner. Colibri isn't even significantly more expensive than many other companies. They have student and South American Explorer Club discounts so ask about that before booking. I would recommend them to anyone at anytime. Exception service."

They were very receptive to our phone calls and Emails and our barrage of questions. We stayed at the Hostel Corihuasi in Cusco which was only a block away from Quechuas Expeditions' office but they came to our hotel the night before the trek to give us an overview of our hike, what to expect and what to take. Our guide was Percy and he was absolutely amazing - very knowledgeable about the area, the history of the Incas, the architecture, flora and fauna. He spoke excellent English and was so interested in making sure that we had a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Quechuas Expeditions provided quality tents, high-end sleeping bags (for a small additional cost) and great therma-rests. The food was outstanding and we had gourmet breakfasts, lunches and dinners - the Chef even made us 2 birthday cakes as there was two people in the group who celebrated birthdays on route. The porters were very supportive, attentive and even brought us hot water and tea first thing in the morning. We would call it 'Glamping' as it was the most glamorous camping that we have experienced while still feeling like the original pilgrims who travelled this route to get to Machu Picchu. We had lots of time to explore Machu Picchu and the option of climbing Huayna Picchu. We ended up spending a night at the Sanctuary Lodge but you could stay all day at Machu Picchu and then return to Cusco. Let Queshuas know what you want to do and they will take care of you."

            "review": "Great Experience. We spent a lot a of time researching Inca Trail trekking companies before deciding on Quechuas Expeditions. We ultimately chose them because they were highly flexible and adaptable to our plans and proved to be very experienced and competent for the job. We had a preference for using a local company, but only if we could be convinced in advance that they would do the job as well or better than the larger outfitters. At the outset, we were, perhaps, not the easiest customers. We wanted to start our trek on a specific date, extend our time at Machu Picchu by an extra day, and because one of our group of three was over 60 years old with double knee replacements we were concerned that we would be slower on the trail than the average hikers. Quechuas was able to accomodate all of these interests. Ultimately, we chose to book a private tour with them, so we could take everything at our own pace. We were particularly pleased that the proprietor, Wayna, took a personal interest in our customer service, even when we acting outside the scope of Inca Trail trek. When we encountered problems with the government website for entrance tickets on our extra day at Machu Picchu, he took care of getting the tickets for us. He let us decide when we wanted to come back, and because we traveled during the time the train did not return all the way to Cuzco, he made sure that his driver was there to pick us up from Ollantaytambo, calling on a cell phone to speak with us once we were picked up and then waiting at the offices to personally meet us upon our return after 8:00 p.m. As for the trek itself, it was a wonderful experience. Wayna is a former guide on the trail and treats his people well. The porters were outstanding, setting up and breaking camp and toting our bags at incredible speed through the mountains. The food was far beyond any expectation, with the Chef preparing three and four course meals. I was frankly speechless when our first dinner on the trail concluded with a dessert of bananas flambe. Also, Quechuas appears to provide better camping equipment than some other companies we observed, including inflatable mattress pads that are far more comfortable than an ordinary pad.We also found that our guide, Ruben (Pancho), was the right fit for our small group. Our understanding is that many Inca Trail guides freelance for several trekking companies. Due to the demands of the hike and the variety of knowledge which each hiker brings to it, the role of a guide is varied, from cheerleader/motivator to local botanist to cultural historian. We considered ourselves well prepared and read about the Incas and Machu Picchu before our trip. We were more concerned about having a guide who would help us overcome the physical challenges of the hike and engage us on a personal level so we could learn about both the Incas of yesteryear and the Peru, though a native resident, of today. Pancho was the right person for that job."

We decided to go with Quechuas expeditions after researching and contacting many different companies offering the classic 4 day inca trail trip. I dont think that we could have made a better choice.On the day of departure, I was teribly ill with food posioning and was supposed to be starting the trek at 6am. After I told the tour Quechuas, they were amazing and organised for my brother and I to start at lunch time, in order for me to get some medicine and rest up. The only extra cost we incurred was the transport there. We had our own guide that day and he was awesome, carried my bag and allowed me to stop whenever I needed.We arrived at camp that night and I was shocked at how luxury it was. All our tents were made for us, we had hot bowls of water ouside our tents to wash our face, it was perfect. There was a constant flow of really great food, some table comments included \"this is the best meal Ive had in South America.\"The guides were great and very adaptable to all our diferent levels of fitness. We were able to stop for a break when needed and never felt pushed to go faster than we could. (this was my biggest concern, but it was not a problem at all). The trek is not easy, but with moderate fitness, you can do it and I will strongly recommend the Inca trail and Quechuas expeditions.It was truly a spectacular trip with an amazing group and memories that will last forever!"

The shurpa's were the best, the company I went with was very organized and accomodating and the food we ate was excellent considering they only had one little bunson burner to cook with. Some of the best food I've had. We ate a 4 course meal every day which you definitely need to keep up your strength. The scenery was beautiful and the people were the best. A definite must is the altitude sickness medication and I would highly recommend getting an antibiotic and bringing it with you because they all went to good use. And I survived the 4 days!"

We took the two day Inca tour (get off the trail around km 106 and then hike the last kms on the trail by Winaywayna, approach Machu Picchu via the sun gate, decend to Machu Picchu, spend the night in Aguas Calientes, then back to tour Machu Picchu the next day, and finally return on the afternoon train to Cusco. Such an amazing journal for those who want to do some hiking and see more things than those just taking the train to Aguas Calientes and busing up to Machu Picchu. The entire journey is almost spiritual. Words alone do not describe the panorama and the beauty of the entire area. The train ride is so cool itself. We arranged our hike through CAT (www.classadventure.travel). I highly recommend their service. Through them I arranged Flights from Lima to Cusco, accomdations in Cusco (Maytaq hotel was very good), excursions in Cusco, the train ride and then the hike. All connections came off very well (except one minor glitch that was rectified quickly.) Tips while in Cusco: It is over 11,000 ft so pay attention to all the recommendations. We are in good shape and still felt it. Take the extra day after arrival in Cusco to shop, tour Cusco or just sit in the squares and enjoy the beauty before traveling on to Machu Picchu. One other tip, crack your window in the hotel as this will allow airflow and the less amount of Oxygen at that height doesn't get stagnant in the room. The three of us had lousy sleep the first night with the windows closed until my son when outside around 3 AM and came back refreshed --room was so sealed the air quality diminished enough that we were all trying to breathe better in our sleep and were not able to. This trip was awesome. Also, don't just bypass LIMA, there are a lot of neat things to see and do there as well."

I have been visiting Peru in January of the current year and the plan was to spend just 10 days there, but after this incredible trip to Machu Picchu...my plans changed and I spent one month in this beautiful Country. We departed on a Thursday morning around 6am from Cusco directed to the Holy Inca's Mountain and we drove on steep and narrow mountains road, discovering uncontaminated areas of the World, where still nature is showing its incredible beauty and biodiversity. To make it shorter: we had some Peruvian food prepared from our guides and chef, we went discovering healing plants, insects and birds extinguished in many other areas of the World and we camped with tents provided from Inca Trail organization on the way to the top of the mountain. It'd be too long to describe all the feelings and energies received during this wonderful trip, but as a result after such a great trip I decided to book other tours (Manu National Park, Puno and Arequipa and many other places) with the same company to discover other areas nearby Cusco and the month passed so fast that I would have loved to have more time and money to stay there and enjoy all tours offered from such an organized company with great smiling and helpful people, like Rider our guide.I would suggest everybody to check them out and choose one of their tour as they have real indigenous people able to explain everything on what Peru has got to offer to its visitor :)Hopefully guys see you in the near future for some few more trips."

At the end of May, my fianc\u00e9 and I did the \"2-day\" Inca Trail hike which consisted of one day of hiking and one day at Machu Picchu. We arrived at kilometer marker 104 from the train at 9-something in the morning with our guide and started our hike from there. My fianc\u00e9 and I each had a camelback, a jacket, some snacks and a camera. We're in great shape muscularly and ok shape cardiovascularly. What a workout! The first half of the hike is mostly up, up, up (stone steps). The second half is mostly flat with a few gradual ups and downs. We made good time, but the stairs nearly kicked my butt. It was all worth it though because the views were spectacular and the sense of accomplishment we felt when we crested the Sungate was unreal. I would definitely want to be in better shape if we tried the 4-day hike (heard day two is really difficult). I'm really glad we spent a couple of days in Cusco prior to our trek so that we could get better acclimated to the altitude too. My best advice for the trek is water, water water! Oh, also, I wore sneakers with good tread and didn't use poles as I felt my ankles and knees were strong enough on their own. I was sore at the end, but appropriately so. My fianc\u00e9 wore Five Finger \"toe shoes\" and also used no poles and was fine as well."

Following the footsteps of Professor Hiram Bingham (a Yale University historian from the United States who discovered many Inca establishments starting 1911), six travelers from various corners of the world, including me, participated in the four-day hiking venture along the ancient Inca Trail in Peru, starting April 28, 2011. We all knew it was going to be a challenging journey, both physically and mentally. However, none of us fully realized the degree of difficulty before the trip and the fun and laughter we would share along the way. In short, everyone agreed afterward that it had been an adventure of a lifetime. The memory of the sweating, the ache of every muscle and bone, and the struggles on the steep climb to the Warmiwanusqa peak with an altitude of 4,215 meters were quickly erased by the laughter each night at the campsites and the strong friendship among the team members. As our guide Freddy promised in the beginning that this was not only going to be a trip, but a pilgrimage. During these four days, we learned more about ourselves and our new limitations. Pushing every physical strength and mental power, each of us was able to fulfill his/her pilgrimage and arrived at Machu Picchu with shaking legs. As we reached the Sun Gate at Machu Picchu, a white Andean condor gracefully glided beyond the gate, a rare showing for the largest and most famous bird in the world. Whatever it might symbolize, we took it as a welcoming sign from the Andean Sun God.To read my entire travel blog about this trip, please visit http://charlieshu.travellerspoint.com/Charlie [--]"

We did the trail in March which we did get a little wet as it is still the rainy season in Cusco, the dry season really starts in late April. However due to work this was the only time we had a window to do the trek. We did get some clear sunny weather on the last day as we were coming into the Sun Gate, the view was spectacular. The Inca Trail is one of those things that I will remember for a lifetime. We organized our trek through an agency called Uncover Latin America. And they were so professional. The advice we got over the phone and through emails was spot on. We found their prices to be the most competitive so we were a little hesitant about what the service was going to be like. The service we got on the Inca Trail was A1. Picked up from our hotels, the food was plentiful and lots of it on the trek. Lots of chicken, beef, pancakes, juices, and plenty of snacks. The porters and the chefs did an awesome job. Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Peru. We have never traveled to South America before and we were not sure what to expect. So different to any place we have ever traveled to before. The people were wonderful, the culture, amazing and so cheap for what you get. Next year we want to come back again to South America but next time visit Argentina and Patagonia. For all those wishing to travel to Peru I recommend at least 2 weeks, and if you are young and fit enough to do some trekking.On the 3rd evening of the Inca Trial you are required to tip the porters, so make sure you bring some Soles along with you (thats the local currency). And remember if you do want to do the Inca Trail to book months in advance to make sure you secure your spaces."

The trail itself is not particularly tough \u2013 it is the altitude which most people struggle with. As this trip last four days you have to be fully interested in trekking/hiking to enjoy it. For many people four days is a long portion of the vacation and I would recommend for them that they do a one day hike and/or take the train/bus to Machu Picchu and make better use of the four days in other locations in Peru.The trail takes you up and down long valleys so you do not get to see much in terms of scenery as you are concentrating on the hike and you mainly see the same valley from different perspectives. In my opinion the trail is only really suited to hikers and those who want the bragging rights of saying they down the trail. Otherwise, you can have 4 days to spend in more enjoyable surroundings in Peru.Machu Picchu is a breathtaking place. My first sight of it from the Sun Gate as the sun lifted the morning mist was like from a dream. It was an amazing place and a definite destination. It does get crowded in the morning though.Trips to Machu Picchu are based in Cuzco \u2013 which is a fantastic base as there are so many sights which can be reached by day trips from the town.The town of Agua Calientes is below Machu Picchu and is nothing to look forward too. Very commercial and nothing really to do other than relax or get a massage before heading to your next destination.Just make sure you bring a decent backpack capable of carrying your sleeping bag etc or ensure you can get a guide to carry them for you. Carrying them in your hand because your backpack is insufficent will make the trek unbearable!PeruTourism was great organising this trip for me. Their support was fantastic and indeed they organised my trip to Peru just as I planned and expected. I recommend this company 100%."

Here are my observations after walking the Short Inca Trail in May.Training.The trail is not to be under estimated, but if you have prepared well it will present a challenge that you will overcome. I'm 49, take regular exercise, but stepped up my training about 3 months before my trip. I included interval training and walking up as many stairs as I could. Strengthen quads, hamstrings and ankles if you feel you are weak in these areas. At sea level there's little you can do to prepare for the altitude before you go. 3 days in Cusco, walking slowly, not too much alcohol, eating healthily and drinking plenty of water should see you in good shape. Also drink the Mate tea which is available everywhere.Things to bring.PassportDay packHiking boots with ankle supportHiking trousers - Those which zip off into shorts seem best.Light fleeceHatPoncho (Not used)SunglassesSun blockInsect repellentCameraWater, high energy drink, snacks.I walked the short Inca Trail in May. The trail is 9 miles long and took around 5.30 hours with breaks for water and snacks. The temperature was around 24*C. The trail starts at KM104 Chachabamba. There is a short walk across a suspension bridge which takes you over the Urubamba River to the checkpoint. Documents are checked and there are toilet facilities if you need them. The trail starts gradually with a combination of paths, small steps and minor inclines. Make the most of this as the trail becomes steep,with a lot more steps shortly after. The trail is a continuous climb with very few flat walking parts. The path is narrow in parts and very close to the edge of the valley below. The scenery is stunning though.Part of the trail and steps to a waterfall leading up to Winya Wayna are slippery and very wet. The steps to Winya Wayna are steep and will certainly test you. There is a restaurant at the top with toilets. It's about 3 hours to this point.Another couple of hours or so of less strenuous walking takes you to the Sun Gate and the first magnificent view of Machu Picchu.Time for a few pictures, and then the bus down to Aguas Calientes for an overnight stay. Went back to the ruins the next day, for a more comprehensive visit. Our guide walked at a pace to suit us and made sure that we had plenty of opportunities to rest and take in fluids.The steep climb and altitude certainly did affect my breathing. Rest when you are advised, and stop if you need to. Having now walked the trail, I think it's relevant to be mentally prepared for the physical exertion. I didn't have a watch and the time is irrelevant. Don't look up to much if you are climbing steps and take enjoyment from completing that section of the walk. See your rest breaks as a reward.Views, Orchids, a waterfall, Winya Wanya and obviously the ultimate highlight of seeing the majesty of Machu Picchu will have made your journey so worth while.Have fun. I did."

Staying up with our guide playing pigs & a**hole and sharing stories after a day of hiking built a sense of comradery between all of us (we're all friends on facebook!). We hiked with Llama Path and they were amazing...no complaints with them whatsoever. Machu Picchu was rained out and I was really sick by the time we reached the sun gate so my romantic fantasy of the ancient Incan city wasn't as great as I had hoped but hiking the trail vs. just taking the train up gave me much more of an appreciation of what the ancient Incans went through and I don't think I could've appreciated M.P. as much unless I did it this way!!! We did the 4d/3n hike and just an FYI the showers at the campsite on the 3rd night are hilarious ( a live wire sticking out going down to the shower head to make the water warm... what a trip! I thought I was going to be electrocuted!!)."

            "review": "Incredible Experience. We did the 4 day Inca Trail hike in October of 2009 through Southern Explorations (strongly recommended), and the hike/mountains is one of the best things I've ever experienced. The hiking is strenuos but manageable if you're in moderate physical condition and the reward of completing the hike is unimagineable. The hike is what made the experience of seeing Machu Picchu, and we enjoyed the Inca Trail much more than the overcrowded (although very majestic) ruins of Machu Picchu itself. The highlight is hands down walking through the Sun Gate... tired as anything from the 4 day hike and catching your first glimpse of Machu Picchu sprawling below you on the mountainside. Words can't describe it, and it made for an unforgettable view and experience.The nuts and bolts of planning a trip.... simple. Use a group. You need permits from the Peruvian goverment to enter the trail and need to book it 6-10 months ahead of time, so save yourself some major hassle and book it up through a reputable group. The porters are an absolute lifesaver, and with them carrying the gear and making camp/cooking your'e really free to just enjoy the hike at your own pace and take everything in. As recent history would suggest, it definitely behooves you to do the trail in the dry season... both due to the risk of flooding and simply because it's more fun to hike in 70 degree sunshine than in the rain. We were lucky and had 5 straight sunny days to hike through, and the different terrains (cloud forest being my personal favorite) were stunning. It gets COLD up in the mountains at night though, especially camping near the high passes so pack accordingly.. whether that's a fleece, long sleeve underwear, or a full jacket/gloves/tuque, it's well worth having along with you.On the trail... absolute MUST have's are... extra toilet paper, broken in boots, two decent sized water bottles, a camera, and extra socks. One thing I wish I'd had is an inflateable pillow, since sleeping on balled up laundary in a sack got really old by the end of the hike. As for meds, make sure you pack some cipro, diamox, and advil. There will be aches and pains galore (if you don't have knee problems before the trip... you sure as heck will afterwards) and nothing can ruin a day like some good old fashion diarrhea. Spending a few days at altitude (Cusco, etc.) to prep is also strongly recommended, as it seems that one person from every group (as in ours) gets laid up in bed for 24 hours due to the altitude. I only experienced a rocking headache but it lasted a full day and a half, so be prepared.There's always debate about which hike to embark on, but unless you're crunched for time I'd definitely go for the full 4-day. It lets you really take in the mountains and there are smaller ruins along the trek that I wouldn't want to have missed. It's true that the best sites are on the last two days, but having 4 days allows more exploration and absolutely make sure that the mountain passes are included in your trip. It hurts like crazy, but there's nothing more satisfying than the feeling of reaching the top of the high passes at 4200 meters elevation and seeing the whole world spread out below you. As a side note... one thing that our travel group did that really helped was start us at an off-time during the day. Most groups start out on the trail at the AM, but for our trip we started about 5-6 kilometers before the Inca Trail... hitting the entrance/bridge around noon. This made a huge difference for us, in that we had the trail and campsites almost entirely to ourselves for the next 3.5 days. We didn't see any other hikers till the end of Day 3, and it made for the 3rd day being slightly more difficult/longer but the overall experience was all the richer for it. Hopefully this helps, and if you have any questions/concerns feel free to drop me an email. The Andes were gorgeous, the people were friendly, and hiking the trail was the adventure of a lifetime."

            "review": "OMG, Skip the 4 day, do the 2 day....and relax!. The 4 day Inca trail is VERY hard and it feels like you\u2019re always going uphill! 25 miles over 2 13,000.00 + mountain peaks. After doing the 4 day hike and camping I would HIGHLY recommend the 2 day hike instead since everything really worth seeing and experiencing is in the last 2 days; the 1st 2 days are simply HELL! I'm not a frilly, out of shape person either (female, 35yrs old, 129lbs and 5'9\", cardio 2-3 times a week and so on) A must is walking sticks...2 of them; you'll need 2 to really get the benefit of having them because you become a 4 legged creature on the trail. You can buy the good ones in town the 1st day of your hike for about 50 soles each (100 soles for a pair) , the locals also sell wooden ones with wool straps for I think around 10-20 soles but after 2 days the straps rip and it\u2019s just a stick, if you do get the cheaper wooden sticks find someone on the street who sells the rubber bottoms you can put on it; it really helps grip the rocks!. The trail; the Incas are amazing; 4 days and I only stepped on 2 loose rocks; however Nothing is flat and every step is a rock (no dirt trails) it\u2019s like walking on a very uneven cobblestone road that climbs a couple thousand feet in a day. And since it\u2019s always misty and wet in the mountains the rocks are wet and slippery too. Bring gold bond powder; it was a life saver after days of being moist and never being able to dry out; a little powder on your tush made all the difference in the world!! For the 4 day trekkers, you can buy water and snacks all along the way in the little villages the 1st 2 days so don't worry about carrying the recommended 2 liters (plus you\u2019re helping the local people) They really pushed bringing water and snacks at the start of the trip and after carrying all that stuff and constantly walking by little villages that sold what I was carrying I was annoyed\u2026plus, your there to help the local people so buy your water and snacks from them! Ask your guide when the VERY last place is to buy water and snacks and then buy what they recommend. The last place (last chance is day 2 around 11am but you start the trail at 5;30am), which was before you summated Dead Woman\u2019s Pass, had ladies with tables selling drinks, snacks and animal crackers. The animal crackers are the way to go! Save 2 bottles at that point (at the end of day 2) because your guide/porters will boil water the next morning so you can fill up your empty water bottles. At the end of day 3 you camp in a place that has a restaurant with food, beer, bathrooms, and showers. You can buy a ticket so you can take really hot shower (cost 5 soles) and rent a towel (5 soles per towel) , towels are nice size. I recommend taking a shower as soon as you arrive in camp\u2026.others waited and had to wait a long time in line. There are only 3 showers and there are 500 people in camp(about 200 tourists and the other 300 are guides or porters) \u2026do the math! I arrived at camp at 5:45pm and was in line by 6pmand had 1 girl in front of me; I waited about 20 minutes but the line built up behind me about 7-8 deep. Not everyone showers on day 3\u2026.you\u2019d think there would be more but luckily for us that want to shower they don\u2019t! The water is hot but low pressure\u2026so everyone takes a long time. The floors are dirty so bring flip flops and a bag to hang your stuff from the nails in the wall (there are 3 nails in the wall and a very small wooden circle bench in the shower stall). You can buy a t-shirt with the Inca trail on it for 25 soles so that\u2019s one less thing to pack if you plan on buying a shirt there; I did; it was fresh and clean\u2026.and dry! Toilet paper, you better have your own supply; there is none the entire way until you get to the camp on day 3! Also, no mirrors or showers until day 3 at the camp site.What amazed me: When we got to the Sun Gate on the 4th day at 6:30am it was solid Fog. You couldn\u2019t even see if there was a valley or mountain let alone Mach Picchu. What amazed me is EVERYONE waited 10-20 minutes and then gave up and started hiking the final 60 minutes down to the ruins (in the fog) That\u2019s around 200 tourist who hiked for 4 days/25 miles/came from across the ocean in a lot of scenarios and they only gave it 10-20 minutes and then simple gave up! My husband and I told our guide to go ahead without us because we were going to sit there until we saw it. The big reward of hiking the trail is the view from the sun gate (this is the view you see all the pictures showing the entire ruin from above). We told her we would meet her at 10am no matter what\u2026.so we sat there and at 8:40am it cleared and it was magnificent! We had the Sun gate all to ourselves, alone at the top of the world looking down on the most stunning view. Then at 9am we headed down the trail towards the ruins, with many different views of it on our way down that we would have not seen in the fog. We were alone on the last hr of the trail; it was like we had a private tour just for us. What is wrong with people\u2026please people\u2026.stop and relax, take it in, smell the flowers, notice the birds, breath the air\u2026.that\u2019s why your there right?.Don\u2019t book the 2pm train back to Cusco, book the later trains and plan on spending some time doing nothing\u2026and just taking it all in! You can eat in Aqua\u2019s Calientes (the city at the base of Machu Picchu where the train departs from) really cheap and they have great cheap shopping for souvenirs so don\u2019t rush out on the 2pm train. If I could do it over again I would do the 2 day hike, everything worth seeing is in the last 2 days. Plus you wouldn\u2019t be so exhausted. Inca trail timeline:Day one: get picked up in Cusco around 7am. Drive 2 hrs to valley (Ollaytambo). Start trail around 11am. Arrive at camp 5:30pmDay 2: wake up at 5am, start trail at 6:30am, arrive at camp at 1:30pm. Hardest day!Day 3: Wake up 5:30am. Start trail 7am. Lunch about 11:30am. Arrive camp at 5;45pm.Day 4: Wake up at 3:50am. At gate to Inca trail entrance into Machu Picchu at 4;45am. Gates don\u2019t open until 5:30am (people line up early to be the 1st in) Arrive at Sungate at 6;30am. Another hour down to Machu Picchu."

It is one thing to take the train down and see it for the day, but it is something completely different ho hike for four days, seeing the ruins and walking the actual trail that the Inca's built. By the third day i was getting a little tired of ruins, but when you see Machu Picchu, its mindblowing! I highly recommend doing some variation of the trail, if you are able - it makes you appreciate the ending more."

            "review": "Inca Trail is a Must for Hiking Enthusiasts in Peru. 4 days, 3 nights overland hike through the Andes Mountains along the traditional (cultural) Inca trail. The hike can be very strenuous in parts - mostly the steep ascents (followed by steep descents) on the 2nd & 3rd day. There are ancient city ruins all along the trail and it culminates with a breathtaking entrance into Machu Picchu, but the best parts were the scenery along the trial and the physical challenge of the hike.The less you bring, the better. You are required to go with a guide and team of porters, who will carry your tents, food & kitchen supplies, as well as cook and set up camp for you. So pack light. Bring layers for sure - you will change from hot to cold all day long as you travel through changing microclimates. A minimum change of clothes, good shoes, water bottle, sleeping bag, camera & flash light are just about all you'll need to enjoy this incredible adventure."

            "review": "The Hike of a Lifetime. For me, the highlight of my trip to Peru was definitely hiking the Inca Trail for four days to reach Machu Picchu. We walked through a variety of landscapes, from desert-like river valleys to elevated cloud forests; camped each night; reached a height of 14,000 feet at Huarmiwa\u00f1usqa (Dead Woman's Pass); and passed by several different Incan ruins (some of which I enjoyed more than Machu Picchu itself). It all culminated with waking up at 4:00am on the final morning to walk as the sun rose to Intipunku, the Sun Gate, where we got our first glimpse of Machu Picchu. My first thought was, \"It looks just like the postcards!\" I booked through Intrepid Travel, who contracted out to Colibri Tours. I would highly recommend this company. Our porters were great and so hardworking, our cook was amazing and the food very impressive, and our guide was very knowledgeable. The sights on this trek are amazing, but the hike itself is challenging. I consider myself in decent shape, and made it through without any problems, but I wish I had trained more prior to the trip to prepare myself. In particular, do lots of aerobic training (you'll notice less oxygen at higher altitudes), and climb lots of stairs. There are so many Incan stone steps! It's a serious hike, but worth every minute of it. Our group was small (only 3 hikers) and I thought that was much better than some of the other groups we passed along the way that had up to 25 hikers per group. The campsites can be a bit crowded and noisy, especially on the 2nd and 3rd night. And be prepared for some smelly, gross, squat toilets (500 people per day use the facilities). Bring your own toilet paper (individual pocket packs of kleenex work well) and hand sanitizer."

A year in advance I planned for my sixtieth birthday to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, arriving on June 21, 2009 for the winter solstice. This four day, three night hike was number #1 on my \"bucket list\". It was tough, but one of my greatest physical accomplishments. The entire week Cusco celebrated with parades and street parties. On June 24, thousands descend on Cusco for the Inti Raymi. The Inti Raymi, the festival when the ancient Incas honored their Sun God. This festival was very colorful and the Peruvian music is magical. I would recommend this trip to everyone. It was spectacular and magical being in Cusco for the greater part of this special week in June."

            "review": "best view of Incan ruins and a test even for experienced hikers. My husband and I did the 4 day Inca Trail hike to Machu Pichu. We used Chaska Tours. We truly believe the hike was an even better experience than seeing the majestic Machu Pichu. The whole experience (hike and Machu Pichu) was a great marriage of appreciating the sacred valley, being a traveler rather than a tourist, and seeing the whole community that is more vast than just Machu Pichu.The trails were nothing like horror stories we were told of from years passed. The new restrictions and codes put on the trail have helped to keep it cleaner and less crowded. Rarely did we run into a crowd and we went during a peak time.The trail is quite hard. You are going either straight up or down most of the time with a few interspersed flat areas. The hike takes you through dry, higher altitudes and lower cloud forests. You see beautiful glaciers off in the distance and valleys that are incomparable. Many ruins are placed near the trail for discovering. You learn a lot about the placement of ruins and purposes of them by traveling up to Machu Pichu in a similar fashion to the way Incas traveled there.Chaska tours we highly recommend. They coordinated our entire trip. Our guide, Hubert, was INCREDIBLY knowledgeable. He has studied the culture, masonry, horticulture, all of it and amazed us with his thoroughness. (Even knew all of the latin names of the orchids, ferns, and mosses).Taking a train to Machu Pichu seems like the worse way to experience it now that we have done the hike.Also, don't waste any time in Aguas Calientes. The city is a dump and lacks authenticity."

We did it with GAP Adventures and I recommend them to anyone doing the trek. The porters are fantastic and you get a great three course meal for lunch and dinner. You never go hungry on the trek. As for fitness levels...I am not very fit. We prepared by walking up and down hills and stairs for three months beforehand. This kind of prep is the bare minimum you would want to do. Well over half the trek is climbing up or down paths, about half, if not more of this are steps. The views are amazing and there is never a dull moment. You will be surprised at what scenery there is along the Inca Trail. For those of you with bad knees, I have had operations on my knees and they were fine day to day, but I found going down the steps extremely hard. There is one part of the trek where you go down and down steps for about two hours. I recommend two walking sticks, plenty of deep heat cream and determination. Make sure you wear your shoes in well before you go. My boots were pretty well worn in and I still got blisters on the bottom of my feet. I took my SLR camera along with me. I do wish I had dumped it for the trek and taken my pocket camera instead. I got sick of having to remove the camera from the bag and just let my partner capture most of the pics with his pocket camera. You also don't want the bulkiness and weight of the camera in your day pack."

I am usually not one that is outdoors or a camper, but I must say the landscape and the views were amazing and well worth it. We had 16 trekkers in our group, which is the max, average age of 30. A couple of us had some issues with the altitude and breathing, but the hike is definitely doable as long as you take everything at your own pace without pushing yourself too hard. Just make sure to drink lots of Coca Tea before you hit the trail. It was definitely chilly during parts of the trail, perhaps 40s or low 50s (F) during the days were the lowest temps, but well preferred over the blazing sun that the summer days can bring. Some parts of the trail do not have much shade. When you reach Machu Picchu, make sure to save enough energy to climb Huayna Picchu, which is about 2 hrs round trip.We were also very happy with Peru Treks and their services as well. Everything from the food made by our chef, to both our guides being so knowledgeable, to even the porters watching out for everyone and our belongings, they made our experience very enjoyable."

The description on the website of the tour company we used said the trail \"winds\" through the Andes mountains and enchanting woodlands. Just so you know ahead of time - it does wind...........as it goes up, and up and up. Go to the gym, get on the stairmaster and stay on for 5 hours. Then triple the difficulty. I'm in good shape, I run miles every week and participate in timed races and I am faithful to the gym. This was hard, people. If you are in great shape, I highly suggest you hire a porter to carry your pack the first 3 days, unless you pack VERY lightly. The hike will be much more enjoyable if you aren't constantly adjusting 30 pounds on your back. Seriously, don't try to \"save money\" while saving your ego. You will be very pleased you chose to only carry water and a few snacks! The cost for the porter was $30 per day. Don't let me scare you....it was very rewarding. There is no scenery like what you will be in the middle of there. Just know,,,,,,,take your time, go slow. BREATHE. It's not a race. We would literally take 20 steps and have to stop for a minute or two to rest. The altitude makes it more difficult, but the coca leaves really do help. Also, DO NOT wear shorts! I was bitten about 20 times on my legs the last day by bugs and it's been 2 weeks since and the bites are still not gone..........and they itch like crazy! Well, the first day was difficult, the second day was the most difficult, the first 2 hours of the third day were more like the second, but then it got way easier and more beautiful. The fourth day was a peice of cake and was really what I was expecting for the whole trip! I'm glad i did it. Not sure if i would do it again. tip: break your shoes in months before you go, if possible!"

The experience of the Inca trail was great, even if it was challenging sometimes, we enjoyed every minute of it and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to experience the amazing nature and history of Peru's Andes. Before we booked the trip I was wondering how fit one needs to be for comleting the trail, but a moderate fitness level and taking time walking these sometimes endless steps is good enough. Good stable trekking boots are very important as the steps are very steep sometimes and it can be slippy too if it rains. At night it was sometimes freezing cold, so enough warm clothes are necessary even if it can be very warm during the day. A head torch instead of a normal one is better as it gets dark early in the evening (around 5:30/6pm) and it helps find the way back to the tent. I would also recommend to take walking sticks as they help decrease the impact of stepping down. Its also advisable to take a spare battery for the camera as there a plenty of opportunities for taking many pics of this breathtaking nature. Although the trail is allowed for 500 people a day it never seemed to be too crowed as all the tour groups have different paces and so people spread out quite a bit. We booked the trip with Pachamama Explorers (in Cusco) and they did a very good job in organising it!"

Every morning they packed up camp after we left, practically ran past us on the trail and had everything set up for us at a lunch stop, and then went on to set up camp for the night. Simply amazing. Machu Picchu was the highlight of course, and arriving there early on the 4th day gave us the majority of the day to explore. There were so many beautiful views along the trail though, and ruins to see on the way, that the trail was a tremendous journey itself. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the ruins, local history, flora and fauna, etc., and never tired of questions. At his encouragement, we hiked to Winay Wayna after arriving at camp the 3rd night and were very glad that we did. It is a stunning site, and we had it all to ourselves!

If you're planning to do it, give yourself at least a few days to adjust to the altitude - going to Arequippa first (higher altitude) or Lake Titikaka first (very high up) to acclimate. 2 days is not quite sufficient. Avoid alcohol and caffeine the first couple days, drink lots of cocoa tea.  the trail and the views are absolutely breathtaking - take time to take pictures, watch the ecosytems change, and enjoy what you're doing. It's so easy to get lost in the drudgery of trudging up a mountain, especially the first pass."
