We found the zoo in the park which was very good value for money. The pandas were great to see. Some of the animals seemed a bit sad / stressed though - personally I would have been happy to pay a bit more money and see them in bigger enclosures"

As well as the usual attractions of large greened areas within this city, there is also a massive statue of a killer whale and a beautiful large water feature surrounded by flowering plants - the fountains function on the hour for 30 minutes and are well worth waiting for."

I was told that park has about 15 attraction to see and I only can manage to see few of it but it makes me to see it again on my next trip to Japan . I was told by the guide that Ueno Park is about 300 acres and in it you have museums , temples, shrines , institutions and schools . The guide told me also the about 10 million people visit this park every year . That's incredible but by my experience it's so true . You have to spend a day here , come early morning , make sure you have comfortable clothes & shoes to walk around . Most importantly bottles of water ya . My recommendation to see, is the Tokyo National museum , Hanami which is viewing of the Sakura that bloom in spring .National museum of nature and science , here you get to see many animals , plants and thee surprise of dinosaurs . Ueno Zoo which I was told that is oldest zoo in Japan but it's not so big but during my time there they had the pandas but sadly I missed it . Also do visit the Ueno Toshogu Shrine , I was there and it was great. During my visit also they had this amazing flower at the park and I truly loved it . Definitely my choice of place to visit , I managed only to see 4 of the attractions but on my next visit I will definitely complete it . Cheers"

But, it was one hell of an experience! Others may say that I am exaggerating things, but for a nature lover like me and knows how to appreciate the beauty of nature, this is one for the books.You just take the train in the JR Yamanote line and get off at Ueno sta. follow the barrage of people walking towards one direction. You will see a walkway that has sakura trees lined up on both sides. You walk through under the roof of sakura blossoms and marvel the beauty of branches of the sakura trees bearing the sakura blossoms. Take photos all you want, nobody will even bother you. It's kind of a long walk, with people seated under the trees for their Hanami, enjoying their food, and the cool breeze of spring. You can even join the locals during their Hanami, just ask if they are ok with it (I haven't encountered any locals that would shoo you away). You can enjoy your food with them, make new friends and get tips!When tired and hungry, there is a starbucks in the premises of the park, and a burger place where they have a drink all you can soda, juice and ice tea.When you're done with your sakura viewing, you can go to the zoo which is also in the park's premises. Although, I would suggest you go there during weekdays as the lines can get really long.If you are not into zoos, you can go out of the park, walk toward your right if you are facing Ueno sta., and do some shopping!"

Get off at Ueno Station and wander the market street where hawkers are flogging street food and bargain clothes and shoes. Not far from here is Ueno Park, which features a giant pond with lotus as far as you can see, excellent paths for walking and is home to a zoo and museums on Japan's history. The museum is top notch with explanations in English on exhibits. We went to the park on a Sunday and there were all sorts of activities, including a fair and music festival. A few attractions within walking distance of the park too, including a historic shrine where we were lucky enough to see a traditional wedding."

I went in from the east entrance after walking 30 to 45 minutes from the Asakusa area (from Sensoji Temple to be exact) and first got to the Museum of Nature & Science on the left side (near the east entrance) where there are a number of \"interesting\" outdoor sculptures like that of a group of priests and that of an archer drawing his bowstring and such. I then went on to the nearby Tokyo National Museum where there's a big pond with water fountains in it at the big open area across the street from the Museum, and the inside was quite a \"worthwhile\" experience with great displays not only from Japan but from other countries of the world (including those from as far as Iran & Egypt). About 5 to 10 minutes south from the National Museum is a temple (likely a taisha shrine by the look of its orange-black torii gates) which is kind of a \"smaller version\" of Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, but yes this one has a much shorter 'tunnel' of torii gates than Fushimi Inari's sembon torii, but it was still a fun experience to go through this one (which I actually did before the sembon torii in Kyoto eight days later). Further down south from that temple and at a little uphill location is the big statue of a warrior with his dog (called Saigo Takamori, I guess that's the name of the warrior) with the nearby tomb of warriors as well. My last stop in the park was Bentendo Shrine in the middle of the lake pretty much all covered with lotus leaves (after coming down the stairs from Saigo Takamori and crossing the street); was a little disappointed since I'd expected to see a \"clear lake\", but the shrine despite its small size has a big orange paper lantern which is even comparable (!) to the big paper lantern at the main hall of Tokyo's most famous temple Sensoji.By subway, the best way is to take the Metro Ginza Line to Ueno Station which is just beside the southeast area of the Park; you'll be pretty much at the south entrance of the Park after coming out of the station (just keep in mind the sites in the Park that I mentioned above will be in the reverse sequence since I made my way down from the National Museum on the north side). Also near the south entrance and just across the street from the Park are plenty of eating places in narrow lanes."

We expected fast trains, skyscrapers, busy city streets so it was important to us to have green grass and to escape the big city when needed! It's not as cool or as eclectic as Central Park in New York, but it's still a huge park and garden oasis in the middle of a bustling city. We took our pram and went to the park 3 days in a row to do various activities. The zoo is amazing. Now, the enclosures are small. That's definitely not enough space for those animals. But they are nice looking and all the animals we saw, pandas included, were all on the move and doing something. They feed them in front of the windows and there's just really great viewing. The zoo was a bit spread out for a toddler - so we went on 2 days. It's cheap, totally affordable to do it a couple times. The weekdays are much better than weekends. The park also has lots of area for sitting, relaxing and people watching. We enjoyed 1 of the museums. We loved the novelty of paddling around the pond in a swan boat. My husband is 6'3, barely fit in the boat, it was just a fun hilarious thing to do for 30 minutes. Our toddler loved feeding the big Koi (i think that's the word for the huge goldfish in the river). We also enjoyed getting drinks at the starbucks in the park. Yea, so we found there was a lot to do and it was nice to have a break from the city and the trains."

The many carnivals, various stands and crowds really enhance the entire festive seasonHave a walk through the crowds, grab some Yakitori from the various stands or just lay a mat down, have a sip of tea and admire the Sakura Blossoms. Visit some of the nearby Temple, Shrines or Museum, even the Zoo.Tips/Advice:-1) Preferred Time of Visiting? While I generally encourage people to visit an attraction early, this is probably one of the exceptions; you should preferably visit here when it is buzzing with people instead - The atmosphere and ambience just felt much better.2) Admission Fee? Park is free to enter and roam about mostly, except for some of the museums/zoo3) Location : It is just behind JR Ueno station, barely a few steps away.

There\u2019s not a lot of room to maneuver around since there is so much people! But it is a great place to see and admire the cherry blossoms. There are also an abundance of food stands in the park selling your typical street fare \u2013 takoyaki, grilled squid, yakisoba, saki, beer, oden, etc. Make sure you grab something to eat from those stands because they\u2019re really delicious!

Having spent a couple of hours walking around the park we had a rest and then walked to the Yushima Tenmangu shrine. There was a little market place there and we found a stall selling Tokoyaki octopus balls. Must admit we didn't really like them because it tasted as though the batter was still raw. We bought a choc banana for dessert from one of the stalls then walked to Ameyoko market."

In a city which is almost void of green spaces Ueno park is a large green area just to the north of central Tokyo and easily accesible by the Yanomote JR line.Yes, its a public space which does mean its popular with the locals and as already mentioned its great for people watching, especially at the weekend. If you go on a Sunday the local camera clubs are all out with more equipment kit than you see in the average camera shop. they will usually hire a model in traditional dress to stand by the lakes and flower beds whilst they snap away. And they don't mind if you sneak in and take a couple of snaps along with them.There are two largeish lakes , which are good to walk round, a smattering of shrines hidden away and it is home to Tokyo Zoo and Museums. The zoo features the giant pandas!To confirm other reviewers , this is more of a municiple park, so does not have the feeling and serenity of other Japanese Garden areas, but if you want to escape the concrete density of the City for a short while, this is a good spotif you do visit during Cherry Blossom season Ueno park is a fantastic place to visit to see the Cherry trees in all their splendour.It is traditional for the Tokyo workers to have after-work Cherry Blossom parties by picnicking underneath the Cherry trees. Office managers will send the office juniors out very early in the morning with their plastic sheets to bag a spot and sit under the tree all day until the rest of the office come early evening.you should make it a pint to visit this park. Weekends are the best for the street performers and vendors. If you want a more quite experience, week days will be better.Have fun!"

Since it was in the month of May, Sakura was no where to be seen. It has a few museums, some kiddo rides, a zoo, Starbucks, caf\u00e9s and a few eateries. The whole park was filled with people. There was a book fair during my visit. It was so crowded and there were long queues for buying tickets to the attractions and to get food. Other than some roses in the water feature area, there wasn't a lot of flowers to be seen there.Besides the park, there's a huge lake on the west side, with paddle swan boats. It also had many small food stalls around that area. To me, the place is not that great if you are not into arts and museums. I personally much prefer Shinjuku Gyoen which has more class and a lot more beautiful flowers to admire!"

You can enjoy a nice Ueno park which contains nice walking area (good for green or cherry blossom viewing), a small zoo for kids, some small but historical shrines and a large pond nearby. Also there are several museums at the end of the park (there are some great Japanese and western exhibitions held every now and then). On the other side of the park is a shopping area. There used to be a lot of doggy market style shops with counterfeit goods etc... which was fun to look around. It has been cleaned out recently but it still has an interesting buzzy atmosphere to enjoy. Particularly it is popular for shoes with many shoe shops (knock off prices). The one I bought was slightly cheaper than online shop. If you stay in the Tokyo station / Ginza area, this Ueno area would be a great place to visit with 15-20min train ride."

The park is free and easily accessible, next to the Ueno subway station. There were large crowds, especially around the few trees that were blooming. The few blooming trees attracted constant attention, and we felt that one tree was particularly attractive. We enjoyed the view of the lake from the top of the hill and browsing the food stalls near the lake. We went only for the cherry blossoms, so we did not visit museums or other places of interest. But we felt content that we had seen one of the most written-about and talked-about places in Tokyo."

There were many people out to see the trees and small parties, but we found the crowds manageable. Many food stalls were set up where we could buy savoury and sweet food and drinks (but they were not cheap). We were too late to see the zoo which was nearby or any of the other attractions in the area (there are quite a few). The lake was beautiful, surrounded by cherry trees in full flower. From Ueno we were able to get the train back to Haneda for our flight, a trip of less than an hour."

No reservation, just show up at the Green Salon in Ueno Park on Sunday, Wednesday, Friday at 10:30am or 1:30 pm. This was their current offering; it may change. The tour emphasized history but was designed for the average tourist like myself who just wants to know a bit more. Our guide brought to life a place he called \"Japan in a nutshell.\" It would surely have been of interest to more than just the three of us who showed up. It is also a rare chance to talk to a friendly, fluent English speaking Japanese person about Japanese life in general."

In spring the cherry blossoms are amazing and the lotus pond has some of the largest lotus blossoms I've even seen. But even in winter when the trees are bare and the lotus is reduced to golden stalks the park is lovely. There are a couple small shrines on an island in the middle of Shinobazu Pond, and snack vendors set up on weekends. Great place for a stroll in the early evening before you head to nearby Taito for some after-work snacks and sake."

My first time seeing a park full of Sakuras and I was not disappointed. It was during full bloom before the flowers start falling and the leaves start to come out.Awfully crowded, but the park is big enough that you still can find some less crowded pathways and spaces if you need to take a break from the crowd. There are food stalls lined up at the lake and at the main park designated paths. I'm not sure if the stalls are there outside the Sakura season. I did not see many souvenir stalls but there were some antique goods sold flea market style.Be sure to go for the night walks during the sakura season, it's just wonderful. For a coffee lover like me, Starbucks is there to quench my need for caffeine."

We also visited the Ueno Zoo in side the park and the kids really enjoyed looking at the Pandas. We also visited one of the six museums in the park. And at the end we had the street food available inside the park. The food was too good. Also there are many ice cream shops which people of all age will like. This place is just outside the Ueno station. We had three huge luggage which we had stored in the storage locker provided at the Ueno station and we went inside the park hands free.

It looked so inviting to picnic, and then we came across the street food vendors, selling barbecued sweet corn, and chicken satay like food on sticks and other hot delicious food. Opposite were tables with chairs and benches so if you couldn't sit on the floor you could still sit and eat. The only downside I think for accessibility, I remember a few stone steps leading to the area, but I don't remember any upon leaving, so if you need to, it may be best to ask for directions to gain entry without going up the steeps. People are so helpful, the Japanese, will go out of their way to help, even if you don't speak their language."

Tourists and locals all come out to enjoy the blossoms. It's a beautiful walk down the sidewalk under all the trees. There are paddle boats available for rental (though the pond was also crowed with boats!). It's worth your time though if you don't mind the crowds."

All seem to be having a lovely time with a hearty food and drink picnic to weedle the day away. Quite a spectacle seeing the trees in blossom and how welcome they are to the locals. The park also has a shrine, a zoo and many other attractions to fill an easy couple or few hours depending on much time you have. Great views across the river and stalls selling various foods and drinks. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and buzzing atmosphere. Try it for yourself and take as little or long time as you feel fit."

On one side, you also have the option of renting an obnoxious looking swan-shaped pedal boat, if that's your thing, or chuckling at them from the shore if it's not.

I visited during cherry blossom time when many people were there and food stalls were in full swing but there would be lots to look at at other times of the year. It is next to all the Ueno stations.

Pro tip is to walk around the whole park and see its diversity - not just near the main entrance and museums."

We arrived at the park before most things opened so we took a little walk around the pond, which is choked full of lotuses. It looked like an actual pond on our map, so it was a little surprising to see it look more like a field in person, but it was interesting and we also got to see some turtles and koi in the water. There is plenty to see in the park; we visited the Bentendo temple and the Tosho-Gu shrine, and strolled along the tree lined walkways (we were a little early for the Autumn leaves, and I believe the trees are a sight to behold when the cherries are blossoming). We were going to be grown-up-adult type people and visit museums and galleries all day, but instead we went to the zoo in the morning and visited the Museum of Nature and Science in the afternoon to make up for our morningly lapse. We ended up going to the zoo because the entrance fee was ridiculously cheap compared to British zoos, and they had a panda (I'd never seen a panda before, it definitely seemed worth the price!).The museum had some interesting exhibits, and the roof garden was a lovely place to sit and relax. You could probably spend a whole day exploring just the Nature and Science Museum, let alone the rest of the museums in the park, so if you are staying in Tokyo for any length of time definitely set some time aside to explore Ueno Park, because there is something for everyone.While the zoo seemed very cheap compared to UK prices you do have to pay for entry to museums in Japan, so bear that in mind when budgeting for your time in the park (especially if you would like to visit a few museums; you won't be able just to nip in and out of them)."

Pick a nice day because this pace requires a lot of walking and does involve a few steps. The heavy concentration of tourist attractions makes this a little bit amusement park feeling however most attractions are good. The temples however contain very little in the way of descriptions of the significance of what is being seen so a little background research may go a long way in your enjoyment. the amount of activities in this area can also be overwhelming so come with an idea of what you want to see because it is impossible to see it all in one day. The park its self specially the lotus flowers make it nice to also just walk around in without visiting any attractions"

This park didnt have all those shopping and food stalls that pepper the surroundings towards a shrine or temple, which makes this park a lot more relaxing.

You can also choose to drop by the museums dotted around the park area if just walking in park doesn't sound like your kind of thing - I think there are 3. Best thing to do here?

Very suitable for walking in cool weather. did not go to the zoo or museums but they are right in the park. JR train exit leads right to the park. Many places to eat around the JR station. Can be done in 1 hour if not entering into surrounding temples, etc."

It also has attractions for all ages so one can easily spend the whole day in this area. This time around aside from visiting the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, we spent most of our time at the Ueno Zoo since our 4 year old kid was with us. The zoo, aside from the giant pandas, has a great & impressive selection of animals. They even had a polar bear & some other animal species we haven't even seen before. We love the elephants & their lions and my daughter really enjoyed watching the monkeys. Just outside the zoo is a small amusement park with different rides. Also in the middle of the park is a Starbucks store which was very much welcome in the cold autumn weather. This area has many museums and it will take more than one day to go thru all of them. Just spending time under the trees in the park in already a treat! We love Ueno and may spend a few days there in the future."

The park houses a variety of museums such as the Ueno Royal Museum, Western Art Museum and National Science Museum. Or course, there's the zoo as well!Even though it's the start of winter, I still managed to catch sights of kouyou (autumn colours), which was beautiful. My favourite spot of all, though, is the Toshogu shrine! In contrast to the crowds in the park, the shrine was very tranquil with only a couple of visitors when I went. The shrine itself is certainly a masterpiece! Definitely worth a visit.Ideal for a half day trip (if not visiting the museums) combined with a visit to Ueno town. The park is also super convenient and can be accessed through the 'Park Exit' of JR Ueno station."

I can't imagine visiting Tokyo without going here and trying to discover as many gems as you can! As a photographer, I was enchanted; as a student of history, I was thrilled! If we'd had children along, the zoo, I'm sure, would have been an important stop, instead we hit as many other areas as possible. One piece of warning: there is construction work going on. We found ourselves outside the part, and assumed we could go in another entrance...the next one was more than a mile away. Be careful on the outside edge of the lake! Otherwise, everything was wonderful! The park has easy access from Ueno station, which was on the JR Line so travel was free with our JR pass."

I went for a walk and it was a nice, cool, fall day. There were many folks in the park so it was good for people watching. There is also a lake full of lotus plants and then one for boating (rental boats). There is a Starbucks (sadly) in the middle of the part yet the line was too long for me to consider. The biggest attraction seemed to be the Zoo. There were also a number of temples that were open to the public. There are many trees so it must be incredible during the spring tree blossom season."

Overall, it's a very peaceful and pleasant park away from the crowds and madness of the city. Just remember not to go on a Monday.

The street performances were in 6 or so different areas. Something different each time and a schedule of everything that day to make it easy. There is a lovely carousel and lots of little shops with things like panda shaped waffles, cotton candy, popcorn and some delicious icecream. A large Starbucks too for those who need their caffeine fix.The zoo is lovely. Huge if you are from India and not so large compared to Taronga zoo etc. Enjoyable none the less. There were toddlers, teens and even my 32 year old husband enjoyed it immensely. We got lucky. It was feeding time so the animals were out in all their glory.The park is easy to get to on the JR line or even on the regular metro line. Entry to the park is free but zoo is 600 yen per adult. Totally worth it. The park is also a great place to potentially have a picnic and people watch."

Tokyo is very crowded and hectic, so a short visit to Ueno park is just what you need to find some peace of mind. With artists and a good calligrapher at the entrance, and a visit to the statue of Saigo Takemori (the real 'last Samurai') it is an interesting place to visit, with great history.

The 'Hanami' maps around the park indicate this is a popular place for cherry-blossom viewing in the Spring as well. During our short visit we witnessed a wide cross-section of Japanese society in the park, from suited salarymen to street entertainers to sake-swigging bum fights at the Shinobazu exit!

We watched for quite a while and laughed when someone from the crowd joined in the dancing. Everyone was wearing very nice Kimonos and he, well he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, but I'll give him credit, his dancing did not distract or hinder those who where dancing. Looking at the lines of cherry trees this place would be so beautiful in spring. We also enjoyed a \"Saturday market\" that was set up and selling just about any type of trinkets and pottery one could imagine.The Good: so much to do at this park and all with in short walking The Bad: Not enough time to do and see everything.The Ugly: Fair warning there are Mosquitoes biting unsuspecting tourists.On the scuba bubble scale of 1 to 10, I give this place 7 bubbles"

Go early in the morning (before 11AM), when lotus are full open and it's not so hot. Late in the day, the flowers close. Average temperature around mid-June are in upper 80's or low 90's and very humid. Carry enough water.

The Park Gate exit from JR is almost directly in front of the tourist information office. Make sure you get a map so you don\u2019t miss anything.We visited the kiyomizu kannon-do temple and Gojo-tenjin shrine before heading to the Lotus pond which was spectacular.It was a very rainy day, so we gave the zoo a miss and headed for the National Museum as cafes and coffee shops were packed. I am sure that on a sunny day, the tree-lined avenues would have been beautiful, particularly when the cherry blossom is in full bloom.We were very impressed by Ueno Park and yet only saw a small portion of it! In addition to temples and shrines it contains a number of museums along with libraries, music school and Festival hall.Make sure you visit the gigantic 30m blue whale which is tucked away next to the Museum of Science and Nature.We will certainly visit it again next time we are in Tokyo."

The park grounds were originally part of Kaneiji Temple, which used to be one of the city's largest and wealthiest temples and a family temple of the ruling Tokugawa clan during the Edo Period. Kaneiji stood in the northeast of the capital to protect the city from evil, much like Enryakuji Temple in Kyoto.During the Boshin Civil War, which followed the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Kaneiji suffered nearly complete destruction in a battle between the victorious forces of the new Meiji government and loyalists of the overthrown shogunate. After the battle, the temple grounds were converted into one of Japan's first Western style parks and opened to the public in 1873. A statue of Saigo Takamori, one of the generals in the Battle of Ueno, stands near the park's southern entrance.Ueno Park during the cherry blossom seasonAt the southwestern end of the park lies Shinobazu Pond, one of many reminders of Kaneiji Temple's former grandeur. The pond represents Lake Biwako (in a reference to Kaneiji's model, the Enryakuji Temple of Kyoto, which overlooks Lake Biwako). On an island in the middle of the pond stands Bentendo, a temple hall dedicated to the goddess of Benten.Today Ueno Park is famous for the many museums found on its grounds, especially the Tokyo National Museum, the National Museum for Western Art, the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum and the National Science Museum. It is also home to Ueno Zoo, Japan's first zoological garden.Additionally, Ueno Park is one of Tokyo's most popular and lively cherry blossom spots with more than 1000 cherry trees lining its central pathway. The cherry blossoms are usually in bloom during late March and early April and attract large numbers of hanami (cherry blossom viewing) parties."

Ueno Zoo is also located within the park, which offers a good variety of animals for the entry fee (600 yen if I remember correctly; much cheaper than London Zoo in the UK which is less exciting).

The lake has boats and swan paddle boats to try out (700Y) and if it's open (which it wasn't on this particular day, a Monday) then the zoo is also worth walking through. There is a lovely shrine in the park, and it's great for people watching."

Although there are a lot of trees, this park is more concrete pathways than natural forest. There are baseball fields, play grounds, and even what is left of a smaller amusement park rides just outside Ueno Zoo. This is definitely a good place to people watch, especially in the main courtyard, which is a huge, open concrete walkway. Students from Tokyo University walk in a line straight from their campus to the Ueno Station nearby. And there is even one of the largest Starbucks locations I saw in Japan. This park has so much in it, I found myself lost at times, trying to find the right path to the right places. For the life of me, I couldn't find Toshogu Shrine.There are several museums to keep you occupied: The National Museum, Museum of Nature and Science, Metropolitan Art Museum, and the Museum of Western Art.Toshogu Shrine and Gojoten Shrine are on the grounds, as well as Shinobazu Pond.As said, Ueno Zoo also sits within these grounds, which is one reason there are so many playgrounds here and there on the park grounds.Although on the outer-ring of Tokyo, this park is still a moderns structure. You'll be sitting on concrete more than grassy fields. This is a people watching paradise, not at the same level as Harajuku, but more organic and natural. Ameyoko Street is nearby, along with a plethora of restaurants and shops in case you find your way out of Ueno Park."

I came here on my own while in Tokyo for a short week trip -- I'm a huge art / history nerd, so when I saw the various museums listed, I decided Ueno would be my first start. It was a good day visit because the museums are pretty cheap by American / European standards ($5 entry usually). I went to the Western Art museum, which I enjoyed, and then the Metropolitan Museum to see a special British Museum exhibit (100 objects) -- that ticket was a bit more expensive but I wanted to see the show -- I was disappointed it was mostly in Japanese (including the audio guide) but there was some English and I still enjoyed it given my background and knowledge.I decided to skip the National Museum because I'd heard mixed reviews, so I walked around the park, visited the shrine and temple there, walked around the lake, had lunch across the street at a sushi restaurant, and came back for the Shitamachi Museum.Taken together, it was a good day that made me feel like I hit a few things I wanted to see. I went to the Senso-ji Temple at Asakusa a few days later, and since they're pretty close, I'd recommend doing both in one day. You can either take the subway a few stops from the Ueno park Yamanote line stop or just walk the 20-30 minutes over."

There are several museums to visit, none of which are anything special but each worth a quick look. There is also a small zoo (did not visit) and a couple of shrines, which did not impress.We found the park to be poorly maintained, and the gardening to be of poor quality. The large ponds have dirty, murky, stagnant water, so we were not attracted to them. You can rent a pedal boat and cruise around the main pond.......mainly a hit with the kids.Overall, a pleasant visit for a day or two, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Ueno Park."

Entrance fee was not cheap but it was worth it to admire huge blossoming peonies up close. It was also during the Golden Week and the park was filled with people. Word of advice : do not queue to buy museum tickets at the ticket booth just inside the park. After waiting for 20 minutes, we were told they only sell tickets for special exhibitions. Go to the main museum entrance and get your tickets there."

There were hundreds of cherry trees in bloom and 10s of thousands of people, more than I have ever seen in one place. Imagine the crowd exiting a major sporting event and it is exactly like this all day. On the paths, everyone was walking slowly looking at the people and the blossoms and taking lots of pictures. Off the path, every square inch is packed with tarps with people partying on them. Make shift tables out of boxes held their food and lots of Saki was flowing. There were also street vendors selling food and drinks, including alcohol. We went to dinner nearby and came back in the evening. The blossoms are spectacular at night lit up by strings of lanterns. The crowd was only slightly smaller, but there were less children. I took about 250 pictures while I was there and all of them could be a screen saver."

The park houses a zoo and Museum, although when I visited it was a sunny day so I did not want to waste the sunshine. You can hire a bike for 300 JPY a day or 200 JPY for 4 hours, however I was happy just walking and taking photos... One advantage about my visit in late April, (although this was not planed just luck), there were not so many visitors as during the festival.Ueno's busy suburban area also has a fantastic market, which is well worth a visit."

As much as I liked the view of autumn red nothing beats the view of Ueno park during hanami. Hundreds of cherry blossom trees in full bloom, especially by the lagoon. It was a breathtaking view! They also illuminate cherry blossoms at night when it's at it peak. Ueno park is conveniently located right outside of Ueno station. There's also a lot to do here from museums, shrines, Ueno zoo and even the dining options. A recommended place to visit when in Tokyo."

There is a lot to see and do in this area, although on a nicer day it would have been lovely. Bigger than what I expected, got lost and took 20-30 mins to get on track."

I prefer sitting facing the lake, looking at seagulls and ducks and enjoy a skewer of grilled octopus. There were also cherry blossom trees along the lake, but what I enjoyed most was the pink cherry blossom reflection on the surface of the lake and the smell of the flower. There are also a few temples around the park. Street performers too love to perform here because it's crowded with tourists and also locals during sakura viewing season."

Lots of people of all ages, yet they are very friendly and not noisy! The views are great- modern sculptures combined with traditional Japanese gardens and trees, shrubs, flowering plants, etec. We love the sakuras/cherry blossoms of course! We shall be back for sure when the boys finish their studies! We feel so at home and safe in this place- actually anywhere in Japan, we felt so secure! Even inside the trains, the people don't talk very loud, they don't use their mobile phone in a way to disturb others, It is a very civilised place!Ueno Zoo is here too, do visit it, it is charming!"

And for something \"different\", stop by the Starbucks. Starbucks, you say?!?! No, seriously. You'll be utterly blown away by the amazingly polite, pleasant, proactive Japanese service with a smile.

He took us around the park and got to see the small food markets which looked yum. Also saw a few temples which were great. It's the ultimate place for cherry blossoms.

Here you are 2 videos I made of the placeTokyo Ueno Park Part 1 : http://youtu.be/5hn74eROaHATokyo Ueno Park Part 2 : http://youtu.be/L8h_eaMjGisMassive...this is how we could best describe the sheer size (534,000m2) and the many attractions to be found in this park. Established in 1873, Ueno Park is among Japan\u2019s first public parks and home of some major museums like the Tokyo National Museum, National Science Museum, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, National Museum of Western Art, Shitamachi Museum, several temples and even a zoo!It would be impossible to cover all aspects of this park in a single day, so we decided to divide our attention on the cultural aspects of this park and its temples with the following:- Kiyomizu Kannon Temple (Part 1)- Hanazono inari Temple (Part 1)- Gojoten Temple (Part 1)- Toshogu Shrine (Part 2)- Ueno Park Pagoda (Part 2)- Bentendo Temple and the Shinobazu Pond (Part 2)While these temples and places are on the Ueno Park \u201cMust See\u201d list, we would also recommend visiting:- Kaneiji Temple- Ueno DaibutsuKiyomizu Kannon Temple:Originally built in 1631 and part of the Kaneji temple, the Kiyomizu Kannon Temple get it\u2019s design and architecture from the famous Kiyomizu-dera temple in Kyoto and is also home to an image of Kosodate Kannon (Goddess of child-rearing) and a figure of Senju Kannon (Thousand Armed Goddess of Mercy).Gojoten and Hanazono inari Temple:A few meters away from the Kiyomizu Kannon you will find both the Gojoten and Hanazono inari Temples, the Fox Temple. Both temples are actually close to each other and can be mistaken for the one and only place of worship.The Gotojen temple is dedicated to the Scholar and poet Sugawara no Michizane (August 1, 845 - March 26, 903) and located close to the Shinobazu Pond, while the Hanazono inari Temple is dedicated to the Inari Okami, or spirit of the foxes, and can be accessed by a gorgeous series of Japanese Torii.-Kiyomizu Kannon Temple (Part 1)-Hanazono inari Temple (Part 1)-Gojoten Temple (Part 1)Toshogu Shrine:Believe it or not, the Toshogu Shrine is one of only a few Edo-Era structures in Tokyo to have survived earthquakes, fires and even wars. Built in 1627, the Toshogu Shrine underwent a major renovation in 1651 on the orders of the Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu. What\u2019s unique about this shrine, besides being similar in style to the Shrine of Nikko (also called Toshogu) with its gold plated decorations, are its 50 large copper lanterns that guide you through the shrine itself. Usually made from stone, these lanterns were donated to the Shogun by a warlord named Daimyo. Ueno Park Pagoda: Perhaps one of the best parts of the Kaneiji Temple (not covered on these 2 videos), is its pagoda. Separated from its main temple, this 5 storied pagoda can unfortunately only be enjoyed from the Ueno Zoo, and only after spending a few hundred yen. However, the pagoda is not the only beautiful structure to see and enjoy. There are also architectural masterpieces that have for centuries defied the force of Japan\u2019s earthquakes (http://web-japan.org/nipponia/nipponi...)Bentendo Hall Temple and the Shinobazu Pond:Build in the early 17th century by Mizunoya Katsutakathe, the Bentendo Hall Temple is a Benzaiten-type temple located in the middle of the Shinobazu Pond. Unfortunately the actual Bentendo Hall Temple you can see today is not the original, and was in fact rebuilt from the ground up in 1958 after being destroyed in 1945. To be fair this temple is not the most interesting part of Uneo Park, however its pond and the giant lotuses are magnificent and can be fully enjoyed in the summer where they cover the entire surface of the pond."

The Ueno Park seems to be chiefly known--at least to foreign visitors--as the home of major attractions including the zoo and world-class museums (I've already reviewed one of these, the Tokyo National Museum). There are, however, dozens of other interesting things in the park, well worth taking the time to discover. Here are some:The Tokugawa Shrine is in the center of the park. There is a Chinese wall around it, with a Chinese gate proving access, and a torii gate before the Chinese one. There are avenues lined with stone lanterns. As you get close to the shrine you\"ll see 48 bronze lanterns (these were donated by feudal lords to show respect for Yokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, to whom the shrine was dedicated in 1627.) The torii gate, Chinese gate and wall, bronze lanterns and the shrine itself are all officially designated as important cultural assets. Inside the shrine is a flame which has been burning there for almost 25 years; the flame's sources actually go back to August 1945. A man returned to Hiroshima just after the atomic explosion, looking for his uncle. He never found him, but did find his uncle's house, still smoldering. On impulse he lit something from that flame and carried it back with him to his viilage To honor his uncle, he kept the flame alive. 23 years later, his village lit a torch from the flame, vowing to keep it alive as long as there were nuclear weapons. A second flame was added to the first, one which was generated by rubbing the rough edges of two Hiroshima roof tiles together (the A-bomb had fried the tiles creating the rough surfaces--four such tiles are displayed in the Hiroshima Peace Museum, where visitors are encouraged to stroke them: I did, and it's eerie touching the instant the age of nuclear warfare began). When the Hiroshima flame was brought to Ueno Toshogu, a third flame was added as well, created by the friction of two similar roof tiles from Nagasaki.Close by is an equestrian statue of Imperial Prince Komatsunomiya Akihito, first president of the Japanese Red Cross. If you go up to this statue and walk around to the back end, you'll find a stone walkway leading to a memorial honoring General U,S. Grant. Two years after his retirement from public office, President and Mrs. Grant visited Tokyo and planted trees near the Ueno Toshogu shrine--a cypress and magnolia respectively. In 1929 a memorial was erected on the spot by the Japanese government. Underneath the bronze bas relief of General Grant's face are the famous words he said to General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, \"Let us have peace.\" 12 years after placing the memorial, the Japanese government ordered the attack on America's Pearl Harbor. 4 years later, America bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, generating a flame that now burns a few score meters away from Grant's words.The park has Shinto shrines, a pagoda, a burial mound (look for construction barriers just north of it), a totem pole, a pagoda containing the hair of a famous early-Edo period Buddhist priest, a lake, and a statue of Saigo Takamori, \"the last true samurai\", to mention just a few of the many interesting things you can discover by exploring Ueno Park. (See photos)."

The trees are lovely, the sakura are a real treat. In autumn and winter the park is not crowded and takes on a completely different atmosphere. Joggers, mothers pushing baby carriages, families walking the dog, and yes, homeless people sleeping under those same blue tarps.Shrines, museums, the pond with its migratory birds and swan boats for rent, a zoo, outdoor food stalls - something for everyone.

Its expansive grounds contain museums, temples, shrines, a big pond, and a zoo. The place is quite green with lots of cherry trees. Unfortunately, when I visited, the museums were all closed! So, if you are interested in visiting one such as the National Tokyo Museum or Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art, make sure and check their schedules. The park is easily accessible and located next to JR Ueno Station. The park has a main plaza that serves as a public square and overlooks the main entrance of the National Tokyo Museum. In the middle sits a large fountain and on both sides of the plaza are places to eat such as Starbucks and Park Side Cafe. I had a very delicious lunch at Park Side Cafe which offers a variety of delicious salads, pasta and sandwiches. The restaurant's patio is a good place for people watching. My relaxing lunch was only interrupted by a \"minor earthquake\", which by L.A standards (where I come from) was quite frightening. Everyone stopped what they were doing and became very quiet when it occurred. When it stopped, everyone went on with their business as if nothing had happened! I overheard from the people eating next to me that the earthquake was an aftershock from a bigger one that occured in neighboring Ibaraki prefecture.The park's main plaza also connects to a promenade lined with Cherry trees. Here you'll find people relaxing lost in conversations, eating their bentos (box lunches) or enjoying the street performers. I had a chance to see a Kamishibai (paper drama) storyteller and a mime artist who involved their onlookers in their performances. Despite the museum closures and tremor, I had a nice day at the park."

You may hear about Ueno Park (\u4e0a\u91ce\u6069\u8cdc\u516c\u5712, Ueno K\u014den) every once in a while during the cherry blossoming season in Japan. It located in Ueno-Koen, Taito-ku, Tokyo and is the most favored spot for Japanese people to enjoy the cherry blossoms every year during springtime in the Tokyo area. Hamani (\u82b1\u898b, flower viewing) is a traditional Japanese custom of enjoying the transient beauty of flowers. Ueno Park was established in 1873, one year after Yellowstone was established in US. It is also one of the first Japanese public parks. Ueno Park has 538,507 m2 (133 acres) with 8,800 tall trees and Shinobazu Pond in the Tokyo city center. The Shinobazu Pond is populated in the winter by ducks and other migratory birds that fly from as far as Siberia and Alaska.We visited in the morning and found that it is a very large area with so many attractions to see. If you like museums, you may find yourself needing more than one day to see them all, not including the other great attractions in the park. We only visited 2 museums: the National Museum for Western Art, and the Toyokan (Asian Gallery) and Honkan (Japanese Gallery) of Tokyo National Museum. We also visited following temples:*Kiyomizu Kannon-do Temple (\u6e05\u6c34\u89c0\u97f3\u5802) \u2013 Buddhist temple in Ueno Park Tokyo which was completed in 1631 as part of Kaneiji Temple. One of the oldest temples in Tokyo.*Nikko Toshogu Shrine (\u6771\u7167\u5bae) - Established in 1617 and rebuilt in 1636. There are many large copper lanterns on the grounds that are rare seen. Normally the lanterns are made of stone.*Hanazonoinari Shrine (\u82b1\u5712\u7a32\u8377\u795e\u793e) & Gojoten Shrine (\u4e94\u689d\u5929\u795e\u793e)We stopped by Starbucks and enjoy our first Starbucks coffee in Japan. It was so crowded that we had to wait for our coffee for about 25 to 30 minutes. We passed by the Shinobazu Pond and did not have time to see the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum and the National Science Museum. The Ueno Zoo is the Japan's first zoological garden, and we skipped this attraction as well. We were too tired to see anymore due to the exhausting museums visits.Ueno Park is right next to JR Ueno Station. It opens from 5am to 11pm year round except during December 29 to January 3. If you want to experience the traditional Japanese Hamani in the cherry blossoms season, prepare yourself for the crowds of visitors. Be aware that this park also attracts homeless. Although the police try to arrest them, they come back as soon as they can."

There was a big lotus pond filled with lotus leaves/flowers. It was quite remarkable. We also went past a traditional temple and went to the pond where I wanted to take the swan boat. However it wasn't open yet. If I come back here I'd really like to ride the swan boat. Costs 700 yen for 30 minutes.How I got here: Came direct from Haneda Airport using the monorail to Hamamatsucho station and transferred to the JR Yamanote Line to Ueno station. It is just opposite the station at the Park Exit."

We went in May, all the cherry blossoms are gone. The park is very nice and gigantic. It's a good spot for locals to take a break. But for tourists who are on a time constraint during non-sakura viewing season, this park is not a must see. The zoo is nice but nothing to spectacular. I guess my appreciation of the park is very dependent on what I have back home. Compare to all the temples and nature you can see in Kyoto, you can allocate your time to other things in Tokyo."

Many of the museums and sites in the park close during this time. At that time of year, my recommendation is to call ahead or have your hotel call for opening hours as the websites aren't always up-to-date. At other times of the year, there are so many things to do in a small area: museums, gardens, a zoo, small shops."

Just follow the hoards of people exiting the station if you're a bit lost. Entrance to the park is free but entrance into the zoo has a fee. The park is filled with Street Performers, families picnicking, bikes, kids, and snack carts. There are a few museums, temples, and the zoo. I suggest packing a lunch because the nearby coffee shops are usually packed with people. There are a few restaurants (mostly Japanese food but there is an Italian cafe) located inside of Ueno Station if you're hungry, but it it's better to sit outside under the gorgeous cherry blossoms."

It was only three stops for us and we crossed the street, climbed the stairs and found ourselves in the park. It isn't marked well at all so ask if you aren't sure you are in the right place. Only one entrance had a guard station and maps so we started out a bit in the dark. There are numerous wonderful museums in the park: the National museum, the Science Museum, the Metropolitan Art museum and the Museum of Western Art. There is a small zoo, amusement rides for kids,and a lake. The lake was so overgrown with lilies that a boat could not even find water! The entire park, except around the museums , seemed to be in need of upkeep. There were not a lot of places for sitting except around the museum area. The Tosho-gu Shrine was wonderful and had a lovely setting not far from the five story 17th C pagoda which is situated in the zoo. There are several restaurants near the museum area, the largest being Starbucks, where there are also restrooms. There was some sort of a parade when we were there and a lot of families enjoying the day.It is a great place to bring children as it gives them the option to explore in a nice area."

It was very crowded yet the atmosphere was joyous. We walked to a small temple that had an overlook down a hill, across a street to a long row of vendors. At the end of that row was another temple and a lake that was edged in more cherry blossoms. Another part of the park had a beautiful reflecting pond that put on a spraying water show every 15 minutes or so. There were musicians here and there. Past the reflecting pond they had a zoo, an art museum and a historical museum. We didn't go into the zoo or museums so I don't know if they had a fees.

While it was quite crowded - with pedestrians viewing the trees and picnickers enjoying their lunches - it was nice to be able to walk right up to the trees and really see the blossoms. I also went to the Imperial Palace to see the cherry blossoms and the trees were roped off there - though admittedly the crowds were huge and I'm sure they wanted to protect the trees, as well as the Palace. In Ueno Park, there are over 1000 trees and they are of different varieties - so you will see different types and colors of blossoms. The park itself is a nice place to spend a day - after viewing the cherry blossoms, I went to the Tokyo National Museum which is located within the park. Friends from the US, who also travel to Tokyo on business have mentioned enjoying the zoo, as well. The park is right across the street from the Ueno Station so very easy to access."

The park is gorgeous with sakura blossom almost at its every corner. Take a stroll inside the park to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Those with children can enter Ueno zoo which located at the end of the park. Entrance fee is applicable for the zoo. Street vendors selling local food such as takoyaki, grilled fish, squids and noodle can be easily found near the zoo. Try the squid fried with soy sauce, it's pretty tasty.There're some small temples inside the park one of them has Buddha face or Daibutsu nestled on top of the hill. Shinobazu Pond, a natural lake is located at the southern part of the park. You may need to cross the street from the park. It was said the pond full with lotus but we didn't find one when we visited the pond. Sakura blossom by the pond is fabulous. This is in fact a better place to take pictures as the trees are low so you can just stand next to beautiful sakura. Just be patient to get your turn to strike a pose as so many people won't easily be satisfied to take two or three pictures in one spot. Those in romantic mood may canoeing the pond. Ueno park is at it's busiest time end of March or early April. Thousands of people may visit the park since early morning to evening. The amazing thing is that the park remains clean regardless the crowd. "

Although it was crowded it was very safe and offered great people watching .... watching the locals watching the blossom was amazing. Try to go during the day and then come back at night to get two very different perspectives of the blossom. Whilst there we also got to see the enormous bronze statue of Saigo Takamori, the red lacquered Kiyomizu-kannon-do temple, the wild life sanctuary which is the Shinobazu Pond and Tokugawas shrine. Near by are many famous museums and a short walk will get you to the Yanaka cemetery which is certainly worth a look."

I think maybe I went into it expecting a lot more. For me, Bentendo was a bit disappointing, and the park itself wasn't as nice as I was expecting, though I did go in winter so that might have something to do with it. While I probably wouldn't go back if I went to Tokyo again, I would recommend visiting both the Tokyo National Museum, and the National Science Museum, which are both located inside the park."

There are numerous attractions located in the park - numerous museums, a zoo, a few restaurants, shrines, water fountains, and more. Unfortunately, we went to the park on a Monday, so many attractions were closed. The Tokyo National Museum was closed as well as the zoo. So the first thing to know is make sure you don't go on a Monday. The most picturesque area, IMHO, is near the lake/ponds near the southwest/west area of the park. You can rent boats there and there is also a small pond there to feed some hungry fish. You can also see a nice view of Taito in this area.There is also some small shrines in the park area, though the one I visited - Ueno Toshogu Shrine - is a smaller, average run of the mill shrine that's really not worth a separate visit and can be skipped."

Locals spread blankets beneath the trees, where they enjoy food, drink and conversation. I have been to all the areas of Tokyo that feature cherry blossoms and Ueno Park remains my favorite place to see them.But the park also offers attractions year-round. It holds the zoo (home to two pandas) and the following museums: Tokyo National Museum, National Science Museum, National Museum of Western Art, Shitamachi Museum and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Art, where I have attended some excellent exhibitions. Just yesterday, I saw one there focused on Turner. It featured 110 watercolors and paintings by the artist. Other stops for wanderers include temples, shrines and a huge pond, where paddle boats and rowboats can be rented.Sometimes it is nice to go to the park just to amble, away from the city's frenetic pace. Though lots of people are always there, the huge park accommodates them easily. There are many places to stop for a bite to eat or a hot or cold drink, including a very popular Starbucks.

One can exit from Ueno JR station turn right and walk up a fleet of steps to reach Ueno Park. This is Tokyo oldest public park and also part of the historical Shitamachi neighborhood. It is normal that people throng it\u2019s fairly wide pavements with trees on either side, especially famed for its growth of cherry trees. The park is big for one to spend close to a full day exploring around if you go and visit the slew of attractions \u2013 from museums to shrines/temples to even a zoo.! . This is definitely a welcome respite from the maddening crowds of Tokyo\u2019s other attractions like Harajuku and Shibuya \u2013 a pleasant city escape! Here you'll find the National Museum of Western Art, National Museum of Nature and Science (Tokyo's version of the Smithsonian), Tokyo Metro Art Museum, Shitamachi Museum as well as the Tokyo National Museum. Other not-to-be-missed are the Ueno Zoo, \u201cflame of Nagasaki\u201d and statue of Komatsu Akihito. Not to mention the beautiful and scenic Shinobazu pond (\u4e0d\u5fcd\u6c60 ) and the \u2018mother-of-meeting place\u2019 \u2013 the steps below Saigo Takamori.. There are also food and souvenir stands around the park to replenish the tired-hunger soul...And another \u2018attractions\u2019 \u2013 the 2 (or more) little cats nesting comfortably at a tree branch.. It is always packed with visitors attracted by them and taking photographs of them..! I am not exactly a \u2018Park\u2019 person but Ueno Park make me feel relax and instantly in a holiday mood (a similar feel I had years back in Hyde Park).Definitely a sure visit for me when in Tokyo."

Nothing of particular note stands out here (although the incredibly large leaves and beautiful, pink flowers of the plants which grow in Shinobazu Pond certainly catch the eye).There is a small shrine, Bentando, on a strip of land which crosses the pond and there is Kiyomizu Kannondo, a smallish temple. Neither of them, were they on their own in the middle of the city, would qualify as something going out of your way to see though.The Tokyo National Museum, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Western Art Muesum and National Science Museum (with its seemingly life-sized whale rising some three or four stories into the air) are not reviewed here because they are sights unto themselves.What you would come to the park to see, however, is Tokyoites relaxing on a day out with their families. It is a people-watching place. Many visit the Zoo (which I did not visit and which is not reviewed here either). The park is lined with cherry trees (not in bloom when I was there) which I'd imagine would change the appeal of the park in spring.If your purpose for visiting other countries is to observe other cultures and ways of life and not simply to tick off sights gleaned from guide books or picked up from conversations with friends or family who have visited, this should be on your list of places to visit. There\u2019s no shortage of places to see Tokyoites at work throughout the city but this is one of a handful that will give you a window into how they spend their off time with their families."

BUT BEWARE OF THOSE FAKE MONKS !!!!The two times we were there we had been approached by old men in brown robes and white hats with little Buddha-pictures in their hands. The first time we listened - as naive as we were - but when he \"asked\" (or better pushed) for a donation of 20000 Yen (yep, the number is correct) at the entrance of a Shinto shrine (yep, that's not his religion) we smelled that something must be fishy. WE REPORTED IT ALREADY TO THE POLICE (their box is between the Zoo entrance and the main gate), who was pretty surprised by those unwanted pests in \"their\" park. So if you see one/talk to one (we even saw one in Akihabara), report it to the nearest Police station, since they seem to operate Tokyo wide. They had some problems with understanding simple English first, but drawing and an English speaking operator on the phone did the job quite well."

I primarily went to go to the Zoo (and see the panda), but this park is an attraction in its own right. Its absolute enormous with a good 10+ routes of walk to choose from. Go at the right time of year and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom and its absolutely breathtaking. There's a few small typically Japanese style pagodas dotted around the centre of the park to look at as well as a bit of peace and quiet which can be hard to find in Tokyo. The park is literally on the doorstep of the exit of Ueno station so it is very easy to find. There's not particularly anywhere you can eat in the park but there is in the surrounding areas. If you are going to the zoo add extra time to have a look around this park, you wont regret it!"

There were lots of people, mainly Japanese, the weather was superb, a warm breeze made the petals of blossoms fly over you....breathtaking!This park is also perfect if you want to have a picnic.

I have now been 3 times to Ueno and each visit has had a different focus. Ueno is very large in scale and within Ueno's grounds are numerous museums and shrines. The Park houses the Tokyo National Museum (which comprises several large buildings of stunning and varying architecture), The National Museum of Western Art, The National Science Museum (which cant be missed because it has a sculpture of a blue whale out the front) and the small and intimate Shimtamachi History Museum down by the lake. For those less interested in museums and art galleries, there is also a Zoo, the Toshogu Shrine and a lake where in the middle of the lake is Benten-do Temple. In winter this lake is full of water lillies. In spring and summer there are paddle boats shaped like giant swans that are available to paddle around the lake, as well as rowboats.The lake and Benten-do temple are set down from the rest of the park and you access it by going down stairs adjacent to the Shrine. Make sure you do a full circuit of the park and find the very small Shrine that that is circular which a dome on top and spire. Next to it is the large scale face of a buddha- it is all that remains of a giant buddha statue followed the great earthquake in 1923. On the weekends you can also encounter buskers entertaining the crowds as well as rockabillies dancing in the large square near Starbucks cafe. And whilst I have yet to experience cherry blossom viewing at Ueno, I understand it is one of THE most popular spots to view cherry blossoms and is crowded by picnickers during this time.The Park is easily accessible from Ueno station. There are some restaurants and cafes within the Park. Outside the park there are many cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. The park is also very close to Ameyoko Aracade so I would suggest a day trip to visit both attractions."

I went to Ueno Park in late November so I was there for the end of autumn so I wasn't going to see amazing cherry blossoms but there were still some very nice red and yellow ones. The main reason I went was to see the zoo and museums whilst walking around an amazing park. There's so much to see my camera's battery died and I had to use my phone to take photos, luckily it has a decent camera. It is also extremely easy to find as it's only a 2 minute walk from Ueno station (if you get out of the right exit).Like most Japanese parks, there's wonderful nature and temples to see so if you just want to walk around, this park has you covered. There were swan shaped boats you could hire to ride around the water but as I was alone, I didn't think it'd work out well. I wondered about on my planned route to the main museum I wanted to see. I was extremely lucky that there was a chocolate exhibition on so I paid for a bundle ticket which gave me more than I realised, not only access to the chocolate exhibition, but also to the 3 other natural history and science exhibitions that were all connected. They were all fun as I am a bit of a animal/science museum lover so my views may be skewed. I did feel a little weird being a lone 21 year old with school kids running around but the chocolate exhibition was full of fellow adult chocolate lovers. After the museum, I went to starbucks to get a hot chocolate and continued to the main reason I had come to Ueno Park, Ueno Zoo. It was like most zoos but had animals I had never seen in real life due to living in Australia. I looked like a nice zoo, the animals seemed to be taken care of and all the animals were there to be seen. The highlights were seeing an elephant pee like a fire hydrant and the hippo's famous helicopter pooing, I am a child at heart. The food in the zoo is like any normal attraction in Japan, mutli-cultural but can taste the bulk cooking but still very nice. When I bought my ticket to the zoo, I didn't realise that some areas gave you discounts if you show your passports, the lady was nice enough to give me a book for tourists where you get discounts for showing your passport (I got away with showing a photo copy of mine). I give it 5 stars because I loved the things I came to see and I know there are plenty of other places to go to that others would love. I can imagine it being beautiful in spring and probably 10x better."

I visited the Zoo where you can see Pandas, Tiger, Giraffes, Elephants, Hippos the list is long. The Temples are well worth a visit you start by wandering through the Temples Street market where you can pick up your Souvenirs, you can enter one of the temples and make a wish. The outside grounds are filled with shrines and lovely scenery, carp fish swimming under a picturesque bridge. We visited the Tokyo National Museum some of the buildings were closed we got to see the Gallery of Treasures, Japanese Art, Japanese Archaeology. Its well worth a visit."

Exit at the underground station of the Ginza line; look over your head and listen to the continuous clanking of the Japan Railways Yamanote Line; let yourself go following the flow of that sea of people, leave the road, just a few steps and you\u2019ll enter Ueno-Koen (Ueno hill) a park that is at its best during the Hanami, the cherry blossom period (1st decade of April). No cars nor trains noise, now you are in the kingdom of the nature and you walk without a specific destination, phagocytized by a joyous crowd. The main path of the park is a true tunnel created by the cherries and their branches full of flowers, seem to brave the force of gravity. Here meets every kind of people, or the entire staff of a firm or office as well, from the chief to the last employee, all dressed with the same, black pinstripe suit, for a picnic, or a dinner, certainly for one beer, seating on the typical large green plastic sheets, rented by enterprising youth. For Sakura, Ueno in Tokyo is the counterpart of the Maruyama-koen in Kyoto, the latter at its best one week later than in Tokyo, just because of the small differences of their climates."

I'd never done it and it was the most amazing event. If you come during cherry blossom season, I'd highly recommend coming here to experience it. It's extremely busy but orderly. I can't even think of an instance where anyone around us was a bother to anyone else. Everyone stayed in their marked area, and we even had some Japanese folks who spoke a bit of English drop by and say hi and hit on one of the people I was with, haha! He had a guitar with him and even played some songs for us. The people there are amazing and really in the spirit. Though I'm betting the alcohol helps, it's just an experience one must go through to understand.You're also bound to see some crazy things. On our hanami trip there, we saw someone dressed up as Pikachu appear once or twice. The park itself, with all the cherry blossoms, some even falling on you, is beautiful. I love hanami in Japan. It's my favorite part of spring. Pink snow in the spring.(Date of visit was April 2010.)"

Since they were early in Washington DC, we thought we might have missed them, but Japan had an unseasonably cold winter, so the cherry blossoms were actually late. We planned to spend the first two days and the last two days of our trip in Tokyo and boy are we glad we did that. On our very first day, we went to Ueno Park, but none of the trees were in bloom. Not only that, but the entire park was empty. It was like a ghost town, but a very clean one. We still enjoyed walking around and seeing the shrines and temples. 10 days later when we came back to Tokyo, it was completely different. The cherry trees were suddenly in full bloom and Ueno was packed. Unlike the DC Cherry Blossom festival, Ueno Park was very orderly. The crowds kept moving and if you wanted to stop for a picnic, there were roped off sections for that. If you are able to catch the blossoms, I also recommend going back to Ueno at night. In April, it gets dark in Japan around 7pm, so you can be out in the dark before it gets too late. The lit lanterns among the cherry trees was one of the most beautiful sites we saw on the whole trip!"

Cherry blossoms were in full bloom then.Crowds of tourists and locals thronged the park. Many locals were enjoying their cherry blossom parties as they sat on blue coloured ground sheets laid beneath the trees. They chatted. Played board games. Some ate from simple lunch boxes while others came prepared with pots and dishes of hot meals. Some laid down as cherry blossom petals floated down with each breeze. They were all involved in their own merrymaking. There was an air of festivity.We walked to Shinobazu Pond and the walkways around the pond were equally crowded. Only the migratory birds on the marshland in the middle of the pond had all the space to themselves.Hanami at Ueno Park was an opportunity to share in the lifestyle of locals. We learnt later that the tsunami and ensuing tragedies last year took away the joy of hanami for the country. For us to visit Japan and see the resilience of locals and their joy of hanami celebrations was a bitter-sweet experience."

An attraction of course is the zoo where you can see amazing creatures and animals.......from huge, monstrous big black bears to Harry Potter's white owl.........from slithereens to birds, from tigers to huggable pandas. Sad that the cherry blossoms have all fallen out and only the green leaves are visible or the brown empty branches of the tree.

It is a park with lovely walkways lined with Sakura trees but out of the many places we visited Ueno park was simply okay, viewing was better at Chidorigafuchi and the walkway into Hachimangu. We did not see the zoo. the park was very close to the train station so was convenient. Right outside of the station there is a big crossing with dozens of small Japanese stores and restaurants, great food! We visited a small ramen restaurant on a side street and was one of the best ramen's I've ever had!"

Food stalls cluster along the path to the Benten and behind the Benten is Shinobazu Pond where i enjoyed the hanafubuki... it's also near to Ameyoko for a quick shopping & sight seeing"

In a city which is almost void of green spaces Ueno park is a large green area just to the north of central Tokyo and easily accesible by the Yanomote JR line.Yes, its a public space which does mean its popular with the locals and as already mentioned its great for people watching, especially at the weekend. If you go on a Sunday the local camera clubs are all out with more kit than you see in the average camera shop in the UK, and they usually hire a model in traditional dress to stand by the lakes and flower beds whilst they snap away. And they don't mind if you sneak in and take a couple of snaps along with them.There are two largeish lakes , which are good to walk round, a smattering of shrines hidden away and it is home to Tokyo Zoo and Museums.To confirm other reviewers , this is more of a municiple park, so does not have the feeling and serenity of other Japanese Garden areas, but if you want to escape the concrete density of the City for a short while, this is a good spot.And if you do visit during Cherry Blossom season Ueno park is a fantastic place to visit to see the Cherry trees in all their splendour.It is traditional for the Tokyo workers to have after-work Cherry Blossom parties by picnicking underneath the Cherry trees. And to do this they send the office juniors out very early in the morning with their plastic sheets to bag a spot and sit under the tree all day until the rest of the office come early evening."

On the road sides, you can people making reservation on a spot for hanami (cherry blosom viewing and picnic) after work. We went there during evening time and the trees were lit up. The views were just amazing. Everyone was so busy with taking the photographs, finding the best angle to take the shot of the flowers and views, and chatting. I thought I have prepared myself to be amazed by the sakura, but when I reached there, I couldn't comprehend myself! Don't worry about going there with empty stomach, there are food stalls around. You can easily choose any foods you like on the stalls. We visited there again on our last day to view the scene again. This time we were day early morning and it was sunny.

If you like people watching, this might be your place because this large public park is bustling with activity. It did not feel serene like other parks we visited. It is interesting historically because of the temples and a historical statue near the park entrance. There were ALOT of homeless people hanging out in the park and one man dropped his drawers and urinated on the sidewalk right in front of us. We were pretty put off by this sort of behavior. The park felt seedy. The best part was a little shrine tucked away in the park near the zoo entrance. It felt like we were in another world. It was very interesting and quiet. We were the only ones there. Near the shrine is a peace flame. The flame is said to have been kept burning from the original flames of the atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan in the 1940s. The flame survives as a monument to peace and forgiveness. It was incredibly moving to see and was, to me, unexpectedly, the highlight of Ueno Park."

The main part of the park fronts the JR Ueno Station which is the focal point of the Ueno district area. Overall, each museum within Ueno has its own category so I wont get into that. The park grounds are not exactly spectacular to look at but wide open space in itself within Tokyo is a rare situation so just that factor alone brings about a degree of satisfaction to visit Ueno park. If you're a jogger and looking for a good place to work out some continuous miles, Ueno is good for that especially in the evenings when the park becomes much less crowded and eerily quiet. It's also very safe, I did runs at 2am and never felt uneasy about the surroundings at all -- can't say the same for a lot of inner city parks in the US at that time of day!"
