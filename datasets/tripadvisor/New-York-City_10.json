St. Patrick's Cathedral is so beautiful and quite ethereal with the many turrets and spires on the outside but the inside is something on a completely new level. It is a thought provoking yet peaceful building with the most stunning interior, amazing stain glass windows and a very warm welcome. I have visited this Cathedral 3 times, the first being while a close family member was dying and I felt such peace and although I am not of the Catholic faith I felt the need to light a candle for him and spent some time feeling the warmth wrap me in a cloak. This is such a special and beautiful place to visit."

In the midst of some of the most expensive real estate and materialistic appeal in the country, St Patrick's Cathedral stands out and reaches out. Its classic, gothic, architectural beauty contrasts with surrounding structures that are understandably designed to maximize retail sales per square foot. Spacious in its entry, its interior, its heavenly heights and stained glass lighting within, you find yourself breathing differently from the moment you step on the property. Leave the chaos and consumerism of 5th Ave shopping behind for a momentary retreat. You'll be refreshed greatly by even a brief, prayerful pause here. We were."

We were at once awed and oppressed by the opulence of the structure. The architecture is reminiscent of times past when the edifice was a reminder of the transcendence of God and a teaching vehicle for those who were unable to read the Bible. The stained glass windows tell stories, but in 21st century American culture they send a mixed message. At once they call attention to religious lessons and history. On the other hand they are examples of an opulence which belies the church's commitment to investing in the lives of the poor, the victims, the oppressed and all of those who need the church's resources which are now represented in a massive, ornate structure which speaks more to power than to poverty. I admit that this is a biased judgment, but it is at least worth thoughtful contemplation as visitors view the magnificence of St. Patrick's Cathedral."

It's well worth a visit and free!!!! You do have opportunities to make donations or light candles for $2.00. They have a small gift shop and definitely worth taking a peek.

However, in Europe it would not be so special if compared with other Cathedrals in the continent.There are not that many information available about the church, even at the information desk they have close to the entrance. On the other hand, is a bit chocking, the intensive way the 2 gift shops in existence in the church are divulged. There are small folders explaining in details how to get to the shops while we could not find similar with the history of the church. One huge framed picture of a saint actually was an announce saying: do you know that we have 2 gift shops at St. Patrick?

It's a beautiful Cathedral, however attending mass is difficult. It feels disrespectful that while mass is going on, during the consecration, people are walking up and down the aisles, and behind the alter looking at the priest like he is David Copperfield. It is hard to understand why the Cathedral cannot restrict those who walk around the cathedral during the mass. If you are attending mass, i would sit far front and center and close your eyes. "

We were pleasantly surprised to see the celebrant was the Cardinal Timothy Dolan, he was excellent with a spirited homily and nicely paced service.If you need to find a place to see and collect your life, this is it, you feel the splendor and magnificence all around you.

Although it is an intense tourist attraction you can still find a quiet, peaceful, and holy space in the Mary Chapel as you walk to the front right of the main altar. That is a more intimate space with the statue of Mary and a place where people can pray with relatively no distractions. There is a gift shop in the back of the cathedral for souvenirs or religious items. A traditional Mass is held in the cathedral in the early evening on Saturdays and on Sundays."

My wife wanted to see St. Patrick's Cathedral since the cleaning & restoration have been finished, we were able to visit on 8/30/2016. They did an excellent job of cleaning all of the marble, both inside and outside & it certainly looks beautiful. We have visited often over the past 30 years & it had started to look somewhat dirty. The stained glass windows & interior statues are very pretty and also interesting to look at.  I wonder if all the money for cleaning ($177 million +) could have been better used if spent on helping the poor & homeless of the City, instead of making the Cathedral into a bright shiny showplace. I am sure that one can pray in a huge marble building with dirty marble just as well as one can pray in a bldg which has clean shiny marble. Why not use part of the building for homeless to shower & sleep out of the cold. Should be a good mission for a church. I also noticed that they have prominent signs informing visitors that there are two gift shops where one can spend a lot of money. They also charge $2.00 to light a candle & they have staff constantly changing out the old ones. They appear to have a major focus on fund raising."

Saint Patrick Cathedral An Architectural masterwork barely visible among a concrete forest...Last July we were enjoying a Gastrotour week in NY. Of course those days included touristing several of those iconic sites and building in the great City that \"never sleeps\".  As architect, was mandatory a visit to one of the highest, impressive and most magnificent neo-Gothic style building in USA: The Cathedral of St. Patrick (commonly called St. Patrick's Cathedral) is a profusely neo-gothic decorated Roman Catholic Cathedral Church, designed by James Renwick, which is considered one of the most important landmarks in NY with its visible and strategic location east side of famous Fifth Ave, between 50-51 streets (Midtown Manhattan) and directly across Rockefeller Center The construction works, with its huge proportions, were completed in 1878. At that time, present-day midtown Manhattan was far north of the populous areas of New York CityLater, in 1888, its magnificent multiple spires were added. With its 329 feet (100 meters) it was the tallest structure in New York City at that time Our lasts times touristing New York I couldn't visit it, so... I was very disappointed as it was in the phase of an extensive restoration and renovations works which begun back in 2012 and lasted 3 years at a cost of aprox $200 million. Those restoration works were finished by the end of 2015, before Pope Francis visited the cathedral.The restoration included the needed cleaning of its exterior marble details-now beautifully looking- and the restoration of its fantastic stained glass windows and great painted ceilings, among other works That was then...now- as impenitent professional architect, urban planner and history lover, I could fully appreciated this Architectural work of art... ...today \"humble\" sited-barely visible- among a \"concrete and steel forest\" ! An artwork that- hopefully- will remain to be appreciated by generations to come in the future as testimony of those incredible past works of art that today....looks like impossible to create again, even with our architectural programs that, rather than facilitate, probable limit creative works and rather.......has guided us to non-creative patterns of replications and repetitions, composing arts and architecture just reorganizing old and already designed and created elements !"

The Cathedral of St. Patrick, commonly called St. Patrick's Cathedral is an active Roman Catholic church in the heart of one of the busiest parts of NYC. Extensively restored 2012-15, it is the seat of the archbishop of the NY archdiocese. It is also a wonderful example of Neo-Gothic architecture as well as a nice, cool place to get out of the summer heat. The stained glass windows are beautiful and there is a rose window as well. There are two pipe organs and it's a great place to come to hear music. The cathedral is certainly worth seeing on any visit to NYC but be sure to avoid visiting during mass unless you are Catholic."

As you leave the Church, notice the statue of Atlas holding the weight of the world on his shoulders, perfectly framed by the Church doors.

He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves. 13And He declared to them, \u201cIt is written: \u2018My house will be called a house of prayer.\u2019f But you are making it \u2018a den of robbers.\u2019g\u201dOne has to wonder how many poor people could have been helped by the millions needed to build this church.

It is a little strange to have tourists taking photos of you during mass, but the overall production and experience is like nothing I've ever experienced.

We were on our way to Top of the Rock when we walked past the cathedral. So glad we went in. It is huge and the architecture is out of this world. My grandfather recently passed away so we decided to light a candle in his memory. It was very busy inside but everyone was respectful. A wedding was taking place in one of the areas behind the altar. Will definitely visit again."

Outside at least, and the building looks beautifully clean -- still some interesting age stains in places, but glistening in the afternoon sunlight.There are many animals hiding all around St. Patrick's -- on the statues, in the ceiling architecture and stainws glass windows, and in the decorative accents on the altar -- that searching for them is reminiscent of a \"Look and Find\" or an \"I Spy\" book. Try to find the dolphin, the pelican, the dragon, the cats and a mouse; I've found the others, but not the mouse -- and it looks more like a rat to me in the one picture I've seen.The image of a mother pelican with blood trickling from her beak as she feeds her young is based on a legend that in a time of famine, a mother pelican would draw blood from her own chest to feed her babies. The church uses it as a symbol of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the nourishment of the Eucharist.There are many secrets in this wonderful place -- I particularly like the two stained glass windows that no one can see from inside or outside, hidden behind the organ pipes, except through a hidden passage way. Symbolically -- man may not see, but God sees all."

There are bathrooms.There is security and looking in bags, but it is fast, friendly and non invasive. It's particularly nice at Christmas when the nativity is set up. Bring a donation and light a candle for a special intention. Take the time to walk around and look at the details in the art and architecture. There has been an extensive renovation going on for a few years that may be finished, and the changes in color of the stone and marble is incredible. I think you might need to walk up steps to get in, but I can imagine they would have a handicapped entrance. I have never noticed one before so check the website for help with this ahead of time."

We wondered why the cathedral was packed at 5:00 p.m. A woman turned to me and said: \"Have you seen the news?\" and then she explained. There were thousands of people praying during that short visit. It was a powerful experience. Our second visit was in April 2016. I decided to take my mom with me as we stayed nearby at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Words cannot describe the beauty of this American Gothic Revival church that opened in 1879. Please visit and donate money for the restoration of this gorgeous cathedral."

The place is simply stunning in its grandeur. The hand done wood filigree work is stunning and the attention to detail the builder and architect put into this place are thought defying. The church seems to go on and on and is cavernous inside. The confessional booths were very cool and the homage they pay to the many saints is educational. This easily compares to any church in Euripe. My one complaint is that they have really commercialized it with machines to purchase a souveni coin. The guests to the Cathedral should also be required to not make so much noise, as this is a place of worship and not an opportunity for a photo op. I felt bad for the people who were actually there to worship."

Pass the altar, don't worry, it's perfectly ok to do so. When you're behind the main altar, in front of the entrance to the crypts, look straight up and you'll seen, hanging from the ceiling the ecclesiastical hats (that's the fanciest word I know for them) of all the former/deceased Cardinals who headed the Archdiocese of NY.

Beautiful pews. Plenty of places to light a candle and say a prayer. It is an active church - filled with parishioners, tourists, clergy, security guards and plenty of folks just looking for a quiet place to sit. The church steps remain one of the best places in all of NYC to eat a brown bag lunch. Finer people watching you will never find. This is the epi-center of NYC tourism, across the street from Rock Center, the Today Show, Saks, the Tree, 10 blocks south of Central Park and it is all free. Although any contribution you make goes to good use.No trip to NYC is complete without a visit to Saint Pats."

However, this is the first time I saw the makeover - and it is stunning. I know that the renovation cost was over the top - and I'm not totally sure the expense was justified - but the end result is an absolutely beautiful house of worship. From the new lighting to the polished floors - nothing was left undone. I can remember the inside being gray and dusty - and now everything is a creamy white.

Even if you don't attend a Mass (even if you're not Catholic), this is a tourist sight that should be checked out. Classic."

Wow, were my expectations off.First off, there was some kind of mass going on when we entered. (Is that what it's called? I'm not Catholic; pardon my ignorance.) There was a decent amount of people in attendance in the pews, as well as a handful of tourists who bypassed the rope lines in the back and were standing near the congregation snapping selfies with their \"narcissticks\". (Sidenote: is that even allowed? SHOULD it even be allowed? Like I said, I'm not well-versed with the culture of Catholicism, and I realize it varies wildly from traditional to more modern institutions, but still. That seemed rather disrespectful to me. I get the cathedral's gorgeous-- which I'll get to later-- but Snapchatting in the middle of a service crosses the line... right? I'd never do that in a mosque. Honestly made me sad to see.)Loud, billowy organ music played, and the people in the pews sang. Great acoustics, may I comment. And great architecture. The beautiful layered arches were so exquisite and so detailed, and the stained glass windows were fractured with color and light. I could only stand in wonder for many minutes, scanning my eyes across the ceiling and past the walls. There's so much to see, and there's something so sacred about it (deterred slightly by the few tourists who've decided to leave their manners at home). Paired with that haunting organ and the voices of the congregation, I couldn't help but shed a few tears at the utter beauty. (You heard me right. I cried.)So that's the story. Go and visit St. Patrick's Cathedral. Revel in it all."

Its years-long facelift/refurbishing was finally completed about a year ago and inside & out it's beautiful. The sculptures and stained-glass windows are remarkable & inspiring. Any day of the week is fine to visit... just keep in mind that on Saturdays there are often weddings taking place and Sunday morning Mass is always packed (Cardinal Dolan, the current Archbishop of New York, is the celebrant). Also remember that while tourists are always welcome and are free to snap photos, St. Patrick's IS a sacred place of worship so in certain areas photo/videos are not permitted and respectful silence is expected."

The stained glass windows are beautiful and as the sun filters through them one can see little pools of colour on the floor or the pews.

Pass through security and move out into the open area and you are compelled to just look up and take it all in.I happened to visit during mass and sat for a while, listening. It's so odd to have mass going on while people are touring the place, but nice that it's still an active church and not just some relic. Spent time going around, looking at some of the stained glass and statues. It will bend your mind to think of how difficult this place must have been to construct back in the day. Seems impossible.You can light a candle for someone for a $2 donation, which I did. Gift shop provides a postcard to let someone know you lit a candle for them if you want to spend the .50-odd cents and stamp to let them know.I was lucky to be able to hear the gigantic organ play - wow! It fills the space and is so incredible! For that alone I'd suggest you visit during a service if you can - it was the highlight!The reason I gave this only 4 stars is no fault of the attraction - they are currently doing work on it and there is ample noise during visiting hours. I had to try and soak everything in while listening to the saws, hammers, and at the end, a jackhammer - which was brutal in that space. Even so, it was a great visit. Would still go, just be ready for the additional noise."

The majesty of the architecture and the grace and beauty of the chancel, the windows - oh, too much to describe. It is worth the walk through. Have respect when Mass is being conducted.

Of course, the front area of the Cathedral was roped off for the Wedding attendees, but visitors were still allowed in the other areas. It is a beautiful place with stained glass windows and arched ceilings. There is a sense of reverence as one enters through the door, you feel that you are in the presence of God."

The middle section with the pews was roped off for people there to worship, and security staff dressed in black suits manage the foot traffic. Bags are checked at the front entrance (a usual practice and safety precaution at major institutions in NYC). The vaulted ceilings force you to walk around with your head thrown all the way back in a perpetual pose of awe, which is completely appropriate for this magnificent place. A mass was performed while we were there and my mother and I decided spontaneously to attend. Being a lapsed Christian, for me the experience deepened the spiritual feeling that the space evokes. There are several discreet areas along the interior perimeter for gazing at statues of saints, relief sculptures and candles. A particularly sacred section in the back does not allow picture-taking, however, you can still visit. As you enter the church at the front, there is a tiny gift shop for purchasing small mementos, like cards, crosses, rosaries and medallions. Holy water is also available on this side of the church--you're meant to dip your fingers in it and then make the sign of the cross."

We went to the 1015 Sunday Mass, which was a good call - it was the day before Memorial Day, and as well as the usual packed congregation, there was a large contingent of military people there, which added to the atmosphere. The readings were given by an admiral and a marine general, and Cardinal Dolan was the celebrant, with the assistance of an army of priests, deacons, altar servers and the rest. Wonderful music from the choir and magnificent organ, clouds of incense, and when the congregation sang \"America the Beautiful\" as the recessional hymn, there wasn't a dry eye in the house!"

It never fails to impress me, overload my senses and take my breath away with its beautiful and architect. First, I will state that I am not Catholic although my paternal side of my family is. With that said, I have a reverence, appreciation and understanding somewhat of the Catholic faith. I say this because even if you are not Catholic and have no understanding of the faith, the beauty of this cathedral will not fail to impress even the nonbeliever! EVERY detail from the floor to ceiling, walls, nooks/crannies, the world famous stained glass in the front, the pews, the statues, displays, Holy Water vestibules\u2026.nothing is left without esquisite detail and finery. The atmosphere, to me, is almost ethereal. Such energy! Even though hundreds of people are passing through its door daily either touring it or attending service or lighting a candle for a loved one or praying, the senses are overloaded with humbled reverence and beauty of its massiveness and art. I love looking at all the statue displays of the saints, Jesus, Mary and the stories they tell and the numerous statues throughout. I enjoy sitting in the pews up towards the front and just being silent. Listening. Talking to God. Taking it all in. I go to SPC EVERY trip to NYC to find grounding. NYC is very fast paced and can leave one exhausted. I find things slow and my heart regulates in the cathedral with the energy and beauty inside its wall. On a recent trip to NYC the same time the Pope was in town we were on our way to the cathedral just to ground and I met Father Dolan who was outside blessing parishioners. My daughter is moving to NYC for college 7 hours from home and this was a college prep trip. Needless to say I was very stressed and upset over her moving and anxiety from a small WV to NYC. Father spoke to us and said a blessing over my daughter. What a wonderful thing to happen for her!!!! Even the working active part of the church outside of the touristy side is as humble and beautiful as the structure itself. Religious, spiritual or not, I would highly recommend stopping. Its close to all the main shopping areas\u2026Saks, Macy's, Barneys, Nordstrom, Trump Tower, Urban Outfitters, TopShop. All within close walking distance of each other and convenient if in area. Free to go in and roam around and look. Closed to public touring during mass respectfully."

I've never been in such an amazing place of worship. Except, it didn't feel like a place of worship. It felt like a museum. The other tourists (like myself) were very reverent of the space. But I did have to remind myself that this is a church and not a museum. I think it was all the people. I hate to say it, but it is hard to feel the presence of God with hundreds of people standing around taking pictures. I'm terrible, I know. I'm sure mass is different.

The peaceful quiet you find inside is a gift you give yourself in the middle of our usual hectic days. I had not been to visit the Cathedral since the rennovation was complete. What an outstanding job was done! It's like windows were opened and light is now streaming through to let you see just how beautiful it is here. I love to walk completely around the perimeter of the church and take a moment to look and reflect on the beautiful side altars. The Marian chapel directly behind the main altar with its stunning stained glass windows is not to be missed. When I visit this Cathedral, I remember that it is important to take time to pray and reflect on priorities in life. I'm always glad I came and vow to return again soon."

It's light inside with great views and sightlines thanks to slender pillars. As a place of worship it is superb. As a living presence on the heart of a busy city - wow!"

From seeing the people who visit and just stand in awe, I have to agree with them. You can attend Mass, you can visit small chapels that surround the main church, and you can visit the gift shop. If you're looking for a little reflection time while you're in NYC, this is the place."

The stained glass windows are a spectacle in themselves, but it is fantastic to spend a little time at each of the little chapels around the sides of the building to read about each saint commemorated. Each person visiting was there for their own reasons - some to look at the architecture, the paintings, the chapels, to pray, to listen to the music or to attend a service, but all were united in their expressions of awe at this buitiful place of worship."

You'll notice that year's of grime has been removed from the exterior walls.There are many small shrines lining the walls of the main sanctuary. We were surprised to find one honoring the \"Black Madonna\". We visited the original in Czestochowa, Poland in September 2014. Attached is a photo of the Saint Patrick's shrine."

But the chuchr was having repairments inside, and it was so crowded, so it was difficult to enjoy the concert and to admire the architecture... also I did not like the musicians, we went outside and found another very small church and some boys singing outside and that was better."

It is quite beautiful and has a lot of visual details that I would love to have seen closer up. Wish we would have spent more time or maybe taken a tour of the cathedral instead of trying to see it while attending Mass. The Mass was very beautiful with the lovely organ music and cantor, and it was one of the quickest Masses I have ever attended (about 45 mins.). Be prepared to go through a security check upon entering the cathedral (even for Mass) and possibly to receive communion from a man who looks like Secret Service, complete with dark suit & wired ear piece LOL."

Even if you are not a Catholic, they are both real treats to hear. Frankincense was in the air, so that mass was the full Catholic experience. They now have TV monitors for those who are in the back so they can see what is going on up on the altar.If you go for Mass, be sure to come back and see it when nothing is going on as you can leisurely stroll around enjoying the arts within this wonderful cathedral.I thought I remembered a garden to the side of the church but there was nothing there when I went - the grounds were under construction."

And I have seen my fair share of churches. But what impressed me most was the amount of people that go to mass here. Our first visit was on a Tuesday and there were more people in the afternoon then we have on a Sunday in our own church. And the masses are every hour of the day. This church makes you a proud Catholic!"

It was my first visit to New York, and in talking to many locals, they do take their religion seriously, whilst also professing that church attendances are dwindling.

This building is an amazing work of art with such meticulous details in every aspect of the architecture that it will impress even the least cultured visitor. Once you enter the building, your soul will feel a sense of peace almost immediately. Perhaps the hustle and bustle of NYC outside contrasted with the peace and quite of the inside of the church enhances this effect, but I would suggest that there is a bit more to it than that. Don't forget to dip your hand into the holy water and make the sign of the cross (if you are Catholic, or if you like to be respectful of Catholic religion). For a small donation, you can light a candle and say a prayer and perhaps it will put your mind at ease about something. Make your way around the outskirts of the sanctuary and you will find small chapel-altars that are works of art themselves. Each one is just filled with such detail that it will take some time to take it all in if you appreciate this sort of thing.The main altar emanates a sense of holiness that translates into awe and wonder and the pipe organs are the only ones I have ever seen of that scale in my travels. Not only will all the beauty of the architecture amaze you, but walking through the cathedral offers several benefits...1. In the summer, or winter, this is a nice free place to take a rest by sitting in the pews. It is cool in the summer and warm in the winter!2. It is a nice break from the hectic world outside called NYC and you will feel more relaxed after a few minutes.3. This is a spiritual place where you will feel a calmness in your soul, regardless of your religion or lack thereof. You will feel peace.4. Of course there is the beauty and history of this place which will be evident as soon as you enter this place.This is a must see in NYC, especially if you are shopping on 5th Ave and need to rest your feet, cool down, or warm up. You will be impressed and feel rested..."

We came here on my parents 30th wedding anniversary to renew their wedding vows. This was pre-arranged months before our visit and we assumed it would be a quick 'in-n-out' sort of blessing. We went inside the cathedral (which as a building, is breath taking.) and waited to be seen. We were greeted by a priest and were taken to a private room, which was down some stairs at the back of the cathedral that had been set up just for us! The priest remembered all 7 of our names from the phone conversation he had with my dad months prior to our visit, and greeted us all with the most genuinely warm and sincere manner. Not many members of my family are religious, myself included, but after he blessed my parents, renewed their vows and read a few psalms and verses, we all felt very connected and lucky. It was actually a very moving, emotional experience, and it was nice to witness my parents 'get married' again. A few of us shed a tear. The blessing was done mainly for my mum as she is religious, so it meant a lot to her to have this experience. We couldn't have picked a better place, or been blessed by a better priest. We all left feeling very humbled and I often find myself looking back at that experience. All of this was no charge, but we donated towards the church as thanks of the wonderful reception and kindness towards us as a family. This is a remarkable church, but the people who work here are remarkable people."

Began in 1859 and finally completed twenty years later (the Civil War interfered), this pearl of a Roman Catholic Cathedral church was built at a cost of $1.9 million. Later improvements included the great rose window and bronze doors on the Fifth Avenue side. It has been visited by several popes, including Saint John Paul II. Unlike most European Cathedrals, this one does not have a waiting line to visit, which is a refreshing twist. Also unlike European places of worship, this one does not charge admission fees. In front of it marches the St. Patrick's Day Parade which goes as far back as 1766! When you are done here, go see Renwick's other pearl, Grace Church in downtown (separate review)"

When I was growing up St. Patrick's Cathedral, which is one of the largest churches in the US, always appeared an off brown/grey color, probably due to a century's worth of air pollution. Due to the extensive overhaul completed over the last few years, it has been restored to its original glory both inside and out. It has a number of side altars dedicated to different saints that appeal to many ethnic groups, including one dedicated to the American Saint Elizabeth Seaton. If one walks around the back of the nave, you will find the beautiful Lady Chapel where many New Yorkers have been married. Also there are the steps leading down to the crypt in which are buried the Archbishops of New York, along with Bishop Fulton Sheen who some older travelers may remember from his TV show in the '50s, and St. Pierre Touisant, a Haitian immigrant. At Christmas time, a large cr\u00e8che is positioned to the left of the main altar. The cathedral is usually very crowded, bags are checked by security staff at the entrance, and movement may be restricted during services."

I never pass up the opportunity to visit the large Catholic churches as they always have beautiful architecture and d\u00e9cor. We spent some time sitting in the pews enjoying time with God. I don't feel like one has to be a certain denomination to worship in another's sanctuary. If ever in NYC I will defiantly come back here. It's located very close to the Rockefeller Center."

We were part of a large group, and I think we may have crowded some of the regular worshipers there. One lady in front of me seemed perturbed at all these people. But she seemed to enjoy the music provided by the kids when it was all said and done. A few days later, I returned to worship there with my en-laws. It was then that I heard the massive pipe organ, which was just phenomenal. This facility is a beautiful, stunning work of art. It is worth a stop, even for just a few minutes, if you are passing by. A good chance to pause, clear your head, commune with God, rest your body and refresh your soul while in New York."

The Mass had just begun in the very full cathedral, and it was lovely to observe for a few moments from the back of the majestic space. To accommodate parishioners who might not be able to see the front of the cathedral clearly, there are video screens positioned throughout. A nice moment in time on a chilly Sunday in April."

Not only will you be uplifted spiritually, but on an earthly level, you will marvel at the effortless way the Cathedral changes from being a tourist's hot spot to an immense spiritual sanctum in the blink of an eye once the Mass begins...

I really love this church since those days left in my past when I had the chance to study in NYU. Have been to a mass more than once, and in this visit there was one begining when we enter, so we just sat and stay there for the mass, then did the tour, the church was in excellent shape because of Pope Francis visit, the most impressive sight to me was the mother holding his dead son in his arms, I don't know how many Pieta's exist, I think there are four I have seen at least two, maybe three, but they always make me cry. Don't miss St. Patrick's Cathedral when in New York, that would be like missing Saint Peter in The Vatican, or Notre Dame in Paris. I could mention many more but characters wouldn't be enough."

The inside was spectacular - as I particularly enjoy stained glass windows. The massive bronze doors open to Fifth Avenue were stunning. I have always felt it was overcrowded and touristy, with a lot of people not there for any particularly spiritual reason, but the last time I visited was different.

The crowd was poorly behaved during communion and pushed rudely as if they would be left out. This behavior was bordering on the ridiculous. Ushers could have done a better job explaining to the ignorant that no one would be left out and cleared a path for people trying to return from the center aisle. I was actually nervous about getting crushed after Mass and headed for the door when the recessional hymn started. Anyone lucky enough to get a seat was fine, but the standing crowd seemed to be a mix of faithful and curious tourists. Some people left with armloads of palms. It was pretty chaotic."

Walking around inside and looking up at the soaring marble transept, \"sky-high\" vaulting and gorgeous stained glass windows, one is reminded that, amidst the suffering and turmoil in the world today, humans must still harbor beauty and peace within if they are able to create such beautiful and transcendent spaces in the outside world."

The Old St Patrick's was too far downtown and too much like a normal church for the New York that kept on growing and moving uptown.It is grand and huge. There is plenty of marble and decor, and a shop right hand side of the main entrance, which I for one think should be moved to the basement.This church is extremely elitist. On all the great holidays, high mass by the cardinal is by invitation only. This selection by rank is the legacy of Cardinal O'Connor whom the present pope would have surely fired as he was the last openly bigoted bully to run the cathedral in grand style while neglecting his duties, which the scandals of recent years have more than clearly demonstrated. The general look is a mix of pompous and funereal, as if a Protestant architect had been selected but fired in the middle of construction, which was finished at some point by an Eastern European one, from either Slovakia or Southern Ukraine or the guy that designed Temple Emmanuel further up in the avenue. This is a great example of New York trying to delude itself into thinking this is a major basilica in Imperial Vienna or Rome, but it doesn't quiet work: There are a lot of tacky modern sculptures that look embarrassingly aggressive and ugly next to the earlier altars and chapels into which they have been shoved.On the upside there is a relatively new chapel to the Virgin of Guadalupe that has beautiful 18th century painting with the image of the Virgin. It is always packed with flowers and more candles than any other shrine, a clear testimony to the changing population of Catholics in NY which are now by far largely Mexican.The organ is great and if you are there by chance when it's been played by all means enjoy.Avoid being there during the Christmas holiday when it becomes a running corridor for the 5th Avenue crowds that go see the Christmas window displays at Sacks, unless you enjoy being crushed by a shoving and pushing constant flow of humanity."

It can be closed to visitors at times due to events taking place so best to check first before planning a visit. Do a tiny bit of research before visiting as there is a rich history behind its construction, the organs, stained glass rose window, etc."

If there is not a mass ongoing you can take pictures. It is a breathtaking architecture.

This past February, when in New York City, I made sure I stopped by St. Patrick's to check out the result of the restoration. Wow! The white stone walls, columns and vaulted ceiling gleamed! Now, add the beautiful stained glass windows and standing inside one of the most grand cathedrals in the world was like standing inside a gigantic jewel. I also took advantage of the opportunity to attend a Sunday mass (I'm Protestant) and experience that gorgeous architecture, religious pageantry, and huge pipe organ in a worship service. There were several times I got a little choked up by the beauty of the service in such an amazing setting. To top it off the service was presided over by the popular, and charismatic Cardinal Dolan who's originally from my neck of the woods, St. Louis."

We were lucky enough to visit St Patricks in March last year when refurbishment works were going on, these have now finished and the Cathedral is restored to its former glory and some glory it is! The huge stained glass ceilings/glass work is truly something along with the stunning gold altar at the front of the church. All of the priests who perform Mass in this Cathedral must truly experience something when they say Mass here. The marble floors to the lovely stands for lighting candles for those who are no longer with us, is something special. But even though this Cathedral has been restored to its former glory it has touches of every day life now with a machine that mints St Patrick Cathdral coins, yes coins! Whilst there towards the rear of the church a small service/wedding was taking place, which was lovely on Valentine's weekend. Definitely you must visit this Cathedral in the heart of New York but it is so serene and peaceful and gives a calming effect on one when you enter. All patrons adopt the quiet and although busy with patrons, it doesn't lose its charm as a lovely Cathedral."

I sang there as a boy soprano, and have been a constant visitor for more years than I want to think about. It is always a fascinating place, with much to see, and even with the crowds of tourists passing through, there is a sense of peace that slows you down and helps if you want to pray. Several years ago Cardinal Dolan was told that the Cathedral needed work. Not just cleaning and refurbishing, but there were structural concerns that needed to be addressed. So the plans were drawn, the fund-raising started and the scaffolding went up.When the Pope's visit to the US was announced, the work was accelerated, the scaffolding came down, and this focal church on 5th Avenue emerged resplendent. The stained glass windows have not only been cleaned but focused so they look as brilliant outside as they do inside. The stonework is brighter than I have ever seen it, and the whole church has a vibrancy that is exciting. The many side altars are with spending time with. The crypt contains the remains of all the Cardinals of New York. The Lady Chapel is a quiet place to pray. The whole Church is definitely worth a visit, and should be on the list of anyone coming to be a tourist in NY. And if you live here, you definitely should drop in."

As others have noted, it is right in the middle of many modern retail/business/commercial buildings so it certainly stands out - right across the street from Saks Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Centre. I was a bit surprised to see that it is open to the public as a tourist attraction and is also a working church (there was a small service going on in a separate area) although I'm glad it is open because the building, the stained glass windows and the ceilings are amazing to see. Although it was very crowded and busy throughout the church, I was impressed that for the most part, people do move around relatively quietly and behave respectfully. It doesn't matter if you're Catholic or not (we're not), this is a must see in NYC."

The Cardinal himself was celebrating the mas, and he gave the sermon. I was captivated and inspired by what he expressed, also it opened my eyes to what he mentioned. Apart from his excellent sermon, he did not distance himself from the congregation, and showered his love on the children. This was a few days before Christmas.The church itself is beautiful, especially after having had a good clean. Magnificent indeed.The negative side of my visit, was that the security was somewhat overdone. It spoilt things a little, after all it is a church, not a museum. The Cardinal expressed his sense of humour, unlike the stiff upper lip of Cardinals past and present in England.The choir is good, and how I wished I was there for the midnight mass.A highly recommended visit to this awesome church."

After a walk to Central Park, i accidentally stumbled on the name of the church on the tourist map so i decided to find it and wow - we spent more than an hour there and would have probably spent more time if i did not have anything else to do. It is a Catholic Cathedral. The church was opened in 1879 and revamped in Sep 2015 before the Pope's visit. It is all Neo-Gothic style and so intrinsic with its detail - you will not know what to concentrate on at first until you take in all of the beauty and then move on to all the little alcoves. Really full of splendor that i had to \"google\" it after my visit for more detail. Wish i could have afforded the $40 USD coffee table book :) Anyway - i got a coin from a vending machine commemorating the Popes visit with a lovely inscription \"Saint Patrick - Pray for us\". Will remain in my purse always. And oh - i am Hindu - and it was clear that many people visiting were of different faiths but everyone was in awe and oh so solemn. What a lovely Godly experience. There is an exhibition which unfortunately ends today - It is a nativity scene with a difference - called the Basilicata Treasures - The Secret Garden of Southern Italy - The traditional Italian \"Presepe\" - a gift from the Italians to New Yorkers - look it up. A must visit for all tourists and people living in the area."

Truly an architectural gem, it is well worth the few minutes to view, or more if the circumstances and crowds allow.

That was interesting to see! Plenty of seating in this church and it was great to see that Mass started on time. Priest was hard to hear even with the auditory system they had in place. I found it more difficult to listen to Mass here than smaller churches. Nothing flashy, just a simple mass with one priest and one singer/reader. Communion surprisingly went really fast even with ALL of the visiting parishioners. Overall, a nice church with great architecture, but to be honest Mass is more enjoyable in my small hometown church. It is worth a peek if you are going to be in the area."

As we live in Asia I am almost forced to see Buddhist Temples if I want to see any famous sites in cities and my wife enjoys visiting them as she is Buddhist. I love just to see the cities top sites and as we were walking around Rockefeller Center we stumbled upon a beautiful and stunning cathedral and I made my wife go inside. We took many pics from the outside at different times of the day. We did go inside but I felt a little awkward snapping photos because mass was being held it seemed like at night and at all times of the day. It makes sense since it was Christmas season. A beautiful place to behold even while mass is in session. Check it out when visiting Rockefeller Center."

A nice enough priest seem to wander-in from beside the altar. He preached the same homily each day and wasn't very deep. I guess there were staff doing 'jobs' like singing, reading, and extraordinary ministry of HC. If they were more reverential, it might make it more like a Cathedral and less of a tourist attraction. The cathedral itself is beautiful esp after the recent restoration.Go!"

We wandered by St. Patrick's the first night we were there (so beautiful lit up at night) and were surprised to find it open in the evening and actually very crowded. So wonderfully decorated for Christmas! Gorgeous both inside and out - the architecture and stained glass is awe inspiring. I have seen some amazing churches in Paris, Italy and London and St. Patrick's rivals them all! We returned for Sunday Mass which was also a wonderful experience. Was so nice to see so many people in Sunday Mass right in the center of NYC! The experience was truly special. Would definitely go again when back in the city. (My only one disappointment is that people not attending Mass are allowed to wander in and walk around during the Mass celebration. I found this a bit distracting with people taking photos during Mass.) Other than that, an exceptional experience! Was able to light a candle and thank the Lord for the beauty of NYC at Christmas and the resilience of the American people to bounce back after the terror shed upon us in the same city."

Besides, it's such an iconic building and you can go whenever you want and spend as much or as little time as you want. It's also close to other places a visitor would want to go such as Rockefeller Center, Saks 5th Ave store, (and American Girl store for those with young girls) and close to Central Park as well--so you do not have to go out of your way to make a special trip there. The only problem is that, like many famous cathedrals around the world, it feels a little touristy and they sell souvenirs. That does not seem quite right, but I guess it is a source of revenue for them.The church has gone though a restoration and is currently sparkling clean."

From the moment you walk in the door you will be inspired by the outstanding architecture but also the quiet dignity of the century plus structure. Visiting a church is not like visiting any other building and the devine presence can be felt in the respectful quiet of the visitors. Several masses are held daily and on the weekend the music ministry is truly exceptional if you are able to attend. I highly recommend it!"

St Patrick's Cathedral is just beautiful, the high ceiling, attention to detail, and ornaments all add to this great church. The cathedral gets crowded between tourists and worshippers, so when you go remember to enjoy the beauty and respect those whom are seeking a spiritual escape from the city. Look your going to be shopping or sightseeing on Madison Ave, so stop by St Patrick for a few minutes you'll be in awe."

We definitely needed more time to view all that is St. Patrick's Cathedral, but there was a mass in progress, and we didn't feel it was appropriate to \"tour\" the place.This beautiful gothic landmark is built of marble on brick with a gorgeous entrance below a stunning rose window. Construction was started in 1858 with a pause during the Civil War, and it was opened 20 years later. St. Patrick's is easy to find on 5th Avenue right across from Rockefeller Center. If you look down from the Top of the Rock, you will get a good view. The cathedral is designated a National Historic Landmark for good reason. The inside is massive, and will sit 3000 people. From the outside, it looks very much like some centuries old churches in Europe, but is pristine in its cleanliness, inside and out."

And it cleans up very nicely, following a renovation program, which I understand cost around $17 million. I make a stop there almost every time I visit the city. The facade is beautiful, and the interior architecture is exceptionally impressive. However, compared to many European cathedrals, it's a bit short on works of art. If you can think of the art in cathedrals in, for instance, Florence, Rome or Paris, they've got it all over the subject of this review, but then the Europeans have been at it for many centuries, while the Cathedral of St. Patrick was built as recently as the 1800's. And I really enjoy the sound of the organ."

All of the old Roman Catholic churches back East are marvels of architecture as they are made of real materials such as stone, marble, real wood, and have towering steeples. When one steps into an old Catholic Church in New England or the Northeast, one feels that one is in Europe in comparison to the \"barns\" that they call \"churches\" in CA (Yes, there are some exceptions, but overall, CA churches do not have the grandeur one would expect). That said, St. Patrick's Cathedral is larger than your typical, huge New England church, so the immensity is what is jaw-dropping about it. If you have never seen a New England or European church, cathedral, or basilica, by all means check out St. Patrick's Cathedral while in NYC."

Went to to see St Patrick's Cathedral, 5th Avenue, Manhattan, NYC once again, but this time was fortunate to see it in its fully restored glory, ready for Pope Francis' visit three days later. The cathedral was fully illuminated and the marble at its whitest and brightest! When I saw it earlier, it was not so bright and dazzling. The reliefs on the walls stood out so well. The choir was rehearsing for the Popes visit and the sound of its great gallery organ & the singing voices was ethereal! The glass windows were fresh & glowing with brilliance & the colours were almost startling. The stone on the exterior was cleaned to perfection and the great bronze door on the west at 5th Avenue shone like gold!The Cathedral was superb and in all its glory to welcome the Pope. A colossal amount however, was to be spent for its restoration 177 million USD!"

Built between 1858-1879, it is considered one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the United States. Until recently St. Patrick's has been under restorations preventing ideal viewing its interior. We were pleased to discover that these works were finished prior to our recent visit, allowing us full and unobscured sightseeing inside St. Patricks. Within you find lovely side aisle chapels with attractive altars which are very attractive to see. Particularly nice things to see inside include a Pieta sculpture by William O. Partidige (1906), the Stations of the Cross carving (1893), Other nice things to see include the Rose Window above the Great Bronze Door, which is better viewed from the outside of the cathedral, where you can see the Saints which are inset into the door. We also enjoy the two exterior spires and the classic Gothic aspects of both the inside and outside of St. Patrick's. In the end, St. Patrick's makes for a nice cathedral visit for anyone who enjoys Gothic or Neo-Gothic architecture and it can be conveniently added to your sightseeing due to its good location in Upper Midtown. Note: Mass is held quite a few times through the day for anyone interested in attending a service. You can find the schedule on the St. Patrick website. Note: If you enjoy church visits, you can also visit the nearby St. Thomas Church just two blocks away, up 5th Avenue. There is an incredible carved screen behind the main alter that is worth making time to see here."

As a bonus, the Pope recently visited so the whole place has been cleaned!It's a great place to clear your head and simply admire. A perfect sight to see if you're in the area. And if you're in a group and splitting up, make it a meeting point as you literally can't miss it. Our teacher on our school trip told us to meet there without even showing us where it was and we found it with no issues.As a tip- you have your bag searched and I don't think you can take food or any drink but water in."

It is a peaceful and spiritual retreat from the busy city outside. Its lovely to see the respect that people have for the cathedral as they are quiet when inside its door. We went to visit one morning and entered through the side door, we immediately saw a mass going on and after a second realised it was a funeral mass. Tourists were still going into the side and were being respectful, lighting candles etc. but we decided to turn around and revisit later in the day, as I believe that as funeral should have some dignity. When we returned later we lit our candles for our departed relatives who we remember when we are away from home $2 donation each candle. And we looked at the splendour of the cathedrals stained glass windows etc. The outside of the cathedral is also stunning and has just finished being cleaned from top to bottom, so the stonework is now and pale shade of grey, not the dark dirty shade we had seen a few years previously. Even if you are not catholic, St Patricks is a stunning place to visit."

St. Patrick's Cathedral has all of the elements of any classical cathedral in Europe, but is so much newer and brighter that you get a sense of what those European cathedrals must have looked like in their prime.If you are an architecture aficionado, you will love the elements of this structure; if you are a person of faith, you will be inspired by beauty of sanctuary; if you are a history buff, you will see the location of Robert F. Kennedy's funeral in 1968. There are many reasons to visit St. Patrick's Cathedral, so make sure you add this to your list for New York City."

The mass carried on just like any other one I've attended and we left feeling very relaxed and uplifted. Just what we needed after all the stress of the city. Very much recommended."

If you have a chance to stop in and are lucky enough to attend a mass there, you will be in awe of the church's beauty. The history behind the cathedral is interesting. Google it before you go and don't forget to bring your camera so that you can photograph it's beauty and remember it forever. During his recent visit, Pope Francis visited the cathedral."

We visited in the evening when they have congregational members welcoming guests and offering information. I was in a wheelchair and they went out of their way to make everything accessible. Most of all, we loved that this is a real Christian congregation which was obvious to us, although we are not Catholic. When we visited another cathedral-type church in New York, it obviously had abandoned its Christian roots and was more a monument to the achievements of man, which really left us cold. Their treatment of guests was pretty cold as well. Our visit to St. Patrick's, however, was warm and wonderful and memorable."

I lived in NYC in 1985-86 and St Pat's was one of my very favorite places. A beautiful peaceful gem of a place in the heart of the bustling city.It's still JUST as beautiful. From the soaring ceilings to the massive organ pipes, to the intricate woodwork and the incredibly beautiful stained glass.... take it all in. Spend some time, light a candle, visit the replica of The Pieta, and sit down and enjoy the peace. Really a lovely place, no matter your spiritual leaning."

Construction is still ongoing but that didn't stop the multitudes from going inside although it is so large (a whole city block!) that it was not crowded.

Once the scaffolding comes down maybe then I will be able to see the inside better.There are several unique things about the Cathedral, however neither the height or width are one of them.

Open to all this cathedral draws tourists, visitors and the devout and gives them welcome. A functioning place of worship (with an awe inspiring amount of renovation) this is a church that welcomes all and provides full Catholic services, music and devotion with much architectural beauty and history. What You Need To Know*The Cathedral is undergoing extensive work at present in preparation for the visit of the Pope. Consequently, several areas, alters, etc. are not available. However, the Cathedral has provided as much as possible to compensate. Altars, prayer cards, statues have been moved and hopefully you can find what you want.*There is no entrance fee - don't be timid. You can enter, pray, visit, photograph. They are happy to have you there.*Services are held at times throughout the day and you must be respectful of them. The staff will not throw you out but move you away to avoid distracting the faithful. If you wish to attend you are welcome to.*The staff of St Patrick's must be the most courteous and welcoming ever encountered. They truly are happy you are there."

There was a choir playing while we were looking around, which we sat and listened to for a while before continuing our walk around the cathedral.

This cathedral is actually NOT the first cathedral in NYC to bear the name St. Patrick's. The old, original St. Pat's still exists in lower Manhattan near the Bowery and is worth a visit, just for historical reasons. The other 5000+ reviews have said everything that needs to be said about the 'new' St. Pat's and how much it means to both New Yorkers and the nation. I would only add a very few minor points. First. This is a church, and a parish church at that. For this reason tourists are going to find a lot of locals actually using this place as a church. Please respect their peace, prayer and privacy when moving about, talking, taking photos, etc. Second. If you ever get 'overtaxed' by the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, come in here for a real break. Religious or not, it will 'recharge' your batteries and you will leave refreshed and reinvigorated. Third. You can go next door to The Rock (Rockefeller Center) for two things: a snack/meal, and a great birds-eye photo 'top-down' of St. Pat's from the observation decks. Fourth. If you want a fuller experience, check the cathedral website for times of services, music rehearsal sessions and tour dates/times. 60-90 minute tours are free, but donations are gratefully accepted. Finally, don't forget or ignore the gift shops, I say shops because not only is there one inside, but there is one outside as well. Enjoy!"

For approximately 3 years scaffolding has surrounded the church as it is being cleaned and restored. Expected completion is the end of 2015. The good news is the church's main entrance on 5th Avenue is mostly complete and you don't have to walk under the scaffolding to enter. The difference after the cleaning is quite noticeable. But, enter you must for a view of this magnificent church on 50th and 5th Avenue. Some of the best views and photos of St. Patrick's can be found from The Palace Hotel on the Madison Avenue and 50th. Tranquil, serene and a great place to visit.Just a very short walk from Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral is worth the visit. Tours are available and everyone is welcomed. Great stop as you explore NYC. After you visit, you can continue walking east on 50th Street to Park Avenue for stunning views of St. Bartholomew Church, the Met Life Building, both on Park Avenue (and the Met Life beautifully colorfully lit at night) and then eastward to Lexington and 50th for a great photo of the Chrysler Building. After I stopped to photograph these sites, others stopped to take selfies especially at 50th and Lexington for photos of the Chrysler Building. From St. Patrick's Cathedral on 5th Avenue take the walk on 50th through midtown for terrific architecture and photos."

There's no fee (though donations are appreciated) and you can just walk in and walk around.The cathedral is of a classic Gothic design, and attempt to replicate the amazing structures of Europe in New York. I'd say that it might not quite compete with some of the great ones I've seen in Europe, but still is impressive and beautiful enough to be worth a visit.Unfortunately, at the time of our visit in May, 2015, the central area of the cathedral was occupied by massive scaffolding and construction equipment, which made it hard to truly appreciate the cathedral. But even so, we didn't regret stopping in to see it.Note: If the front doors are open, which they often are in warm weather, on your way out look down the main aisle toward the big pipe organ at the back and the doors. The doors frame the statue of Atlas across the street, an interesting (but very difficult to photograph) effect."

When I visited 15 years ago there wasn't security and audio tours it was just a simple beautiful church that you could sit quietly in and have time with God!"

We did not get the chance to go to mass there, which I would have loved to do. The cathedral is currently undergoing a $170 Million restoration.

That is why the front, facing 5th Ave., is spectacularly white and clean. Was a bit disappointed when we arrived for Mass to see that the altar area and transept are also covered by scaffolding for the interior renovations. Upon inquiring, I was told the work should be done by December 2015. St. Patrick's is still stunning and worth a visit, despite not being able to see it in all its glory ~ just don't be surprised."

It is a beautiful church. The only problem we encountered was that they were renovating the church outside and inside so we were not able to really enjoyed the beauty of the church.

Just make sure you get to mass a bit early as the seats fill up. Although the cathedral is under construction, you can still see the fine attention to detail in the creation of this cathedral.

The inside is one big scaffold but despite the renovations it is still gorgeous inside and out. People working inside they had originally been scheduled for December, but with the Pope arriving in September, they might be stepping it up. Best view now is to walk up to the altar and look toward the back of the church to see the windows, organ, and vaulting. Visitors welcome but you may have to have your back pack searched. No bathroom facilities, but Saks 5th Avenue is on the next corner....Take a walk around the perimeter of the church and see all the little niches and altars. Then walk back behind the altar to find some small chapels, etc. Don't let the renovations hinder your visit. Check for mass schedules because it is a working church and sometimes they do not allow visitors."

This is simply a beautiful, iconic structure.The exterior is very Gothic and newly renovated. If you can see it on a nice day it is magnificent.ALERT: With the outside finished, renovation has now turned to the interior, much of which is now completely covered in scaffolding. What you can see is very nice, but, for example, the altar area is completely boxed in with metal supports. If you really want to see the interior in its full glory, you might want to check their website to see if the renovation is still ongoing.The Cathedral does a good job of catering to tourists who want to see the structure (including an audio tour and descriptive materials) and to churchgoers. I attended mass on a Thursday evening and felt no intrusion from onlookers (they cordoned off the area, but were very easy-going about it). Similarly, I had no trouble going around the building afterwards to look at the many lovely chapels. Admission is free, but they do ask for a donation for the upkeep, which is reasonable.St. Patrick's calls itself America's parish. Regardless of whether you agree, it is a holy and awe-inspiring place. Even if you are not Catholic, or even religious, it's worth a visit for its magnificent architecture."

Sadly, this means that visits to see the beautiful church are greatly hindered at this point in time.

This cathedral was not the exception at all. The place looks amazing, it's being cleaned up and the sculpting on the roof is beautiful, you can look all over the place and be amazed. Also, if you're lucky (like me) you can get some people from the congregation to explain you a little about it's history, which makes it even better."

There are many opportunities to light a votive candle, which is always a prayerful moment for me. Make sure you take time to do the walk behind the main altar, as there are several other altars there, and a couple of small chapels--there was adoration going on in one of them, which was an awesome opportunity for Roman Catholics to participate in this Catholic tradition. We were there during the Christmas season, so they also had a Nativity scene set up to the left of the main altar--beautiful with life-size statues and a real manger. Although anyone would appreciate the art and the beauty of the cathedral, it should definitely be on any Roman Catholic's list of things to do while in New York City!"

I have visited St Patrick's Cathedral for 3 years now and still I cannot get a descent picture from the outside since it is surrounded by scaffolding. The cathedral itself is awesome and definitely worth a visit. Keep in mind it is an active Catholic church so regular masses are being held daily.On this particular visit I was delighted to find that on 51st St right across the street from it they have their own gift shop so you do not have to go into the cathedral if you want to make a purchase for someone back home. Regrettably, that store is in a block also under scaffolding but it is not hard to find and it will save you the trouble of a security check if you just want to purchase a gift.It is one of the few attractions that is free and well worth the visit."

The high ceilings will leave you in awe, the sculptures and statues might bring you to tears and the alter will humble your soul. If you\u2019re nearby just take a quick walk in side.

Having said that its really worth the visit and if you get a chance go during the Sunday Mass because you see it in its real environment as an active catholic church. We went to the 10.15 am mass because that one has the church choir which were breathtakingly good especially with the autistics of the church . There is also a really good gift shop across the road on the side street run by the church. A great attraction for the religious and the architect buffs"

It is very spiritual and clam it bring me to peace and forgot about all the construction that was going on. I wasn't christian but still get a very spiritual feeling in there which is pretty awesome."

However, whilst it is a Gothic Cathedral which makes it dark inside anyway, it was made worse by scaffolding. From outside, you can only see the top of the towers, the rest covered by scaffolding and inside it is dark and gloomy with much covered up, ladders / poles etc. There were quite a few visitors wandering around but with banging from the workmen, it was not peaceful. We went to the small shop near the entrance but was told that they had sold out of guide books and we could only get a postcard. I suppose it might be better when finished but I have seen better cathedrals elsewhere."

Very disappointed with the state of the cathedral, obviously significant repairs and renovations are required, but why keep it open to the public during the week? At the moment there is virtually nothing to see other than the main altar, everything else either removed, covered up or hidden by scaffolding. I have been very lucky to visit a large number of cathedrals and churches around the world, many undergoing repair, but never have I seen so much scaffolding within a religious building. Seems to me it is being kept open so people may be tempted to donate to repairs.Close it during the week, get repairs completed more speedily.Basically don't bother visiting at this time, unless of course you are a scaffolding fan!"

Visit this remarkable and beautiful church that is located in the middle of bustling city right beside the festive Rockefeller Center!Built as the seat of the Archbishop of New York, St. Patrick's Cathedral was one of the earlier Catholic churches in America and played a significant role in Catholicism in the United States. In this church, you will find not only the marvelous architectural elements but also beautifully sculptures of Christian figures. Look for the Our Lady of Guadalupe painting given by the pope and the Pieta sculpture that was intended to imitate the one in Vatican but was revised to an unique take because of mechanical balance issues!Take an audio tour to make the most out of your visit! St. Patrick's Cathedral is an excellent stop for any NYC tourists. You can also look up the mass schedule online to participate in one that involves their world-renowned organ music!"

So between the Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue and East 50th street and East 51th street, the whole complex of this decorated Neo-Gothic-style Roman Catholic cathedral church occupies the space amid the high rise buildings as are the Rockefeller Center, Saks Fifth Avenue Building,and others. That was really unusual situation to see one wonderful cathedral with all these gothic decorations on the front and sideways facades, that splendid tower with the spire at its end, these stained windows made by artists from Boston and from European artists from Chartres, France and Birmingham, England, among the steel, concrete and glass of the skyscrapers of one awesome megalopolis. What we now gladly recall of, is one wedding, we've seen from across the street, I think that it was in Madison Avenue from what sidewalk we looked at the Cathedral little stairs beneath the arched stoned vault.Really nice memories."

The cathedral is just amazing and if you don't feel God's presence there you'll never feel him anywhere. My only concern is with the security there, at the front door no trouble with showing your bags or back packs, it's the security with seating an fat communion times. I understand it's hard to organise thousands of people at one time but there is no faith or compassion shown by those mean men, I felt bullied because I refused to jump in front of a man on a wheelchair where I come from you help those less fortunate. Today a family was belittled for climbing UNDER a barrier to find a seat in church, this is not mass!! We should be helping one another on faith.

It's nice to see some of the progress as you make your way through the cathedral. The narthex ceiling looks so much brighter and cleaner than before.

That chapel and organ are concealed in the back of the cathedral because of all the reconstruction work. We lit a couple of candles for loved ones. It's still worth a visit even with all the scaffolding. It was all very beautiful."

We were in New York City in December 2013 for 3 nights and the day before our final night one of my sister\u2019s friends visited us who lives not too far from the city. She was most excited about coming here to visit St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. No one else in our party is practicing Catholic. My daughter who was with me she has been exposed to it though as her Mom\u2019s side of the family are originally from Colombia and are devout Catholics, and my Mother that was with me too and her family has a very light Catholic background.Despite the construction the other members of my party enjoyed walking through this area, lighting some candles and saying a prayer. My sister really liked looking at the architecture. To me it was one of those, you probably need to be Catholic or a fan of buildings to like this. I decided to politely opt out, and sat on the chairs waiting for them to finish, in order to rest my feet. I had travelled 8,500 miles to get to NYC and was on the go all the time since so no one minded or felt I was being rude.Having seen how much others enjoyed this leads me to give it a very good rating. For Non-Catholics this is free to enter and still easy to pop your head in and take a glace if already walking by it. If in the area might as well give at least that a go."

Of course at this time the place is absolutely blanketed in scaffolding inside and out so you really can't catch a glimpse of much of anything other than a statue or two and some stained glass.I could imagine when its not being renovated that it would probably be quite a sight. My girlfriend lit some candles for $2 a piece. We peaked in the closet they call a gift shop where a line of people were jockeying for position to buy something so we just left. I'm sure the renovations will take years so it'll be one of those places where we'll just have to happen to walk by it if we ever see it again. That seems to be the thing in New York, especially the city. Everything is always under construction or being renovated in some way shape or form. There seemed to be potential, and it least it didnt cost anything to walk in. You would think the city would do more to warn you of wasting your time like this...Unless you're into seeing a giant erector set. If so, run on over and feast your eyes"

Then you start to walk around and try to find what you CAN see... and it is beautiful! My husband and I lit a candle for our daughter who has been going through some rough times health-wise - felt so at peace after doing so and got good news about her condition later on in our trip. I hope to return to the cathedral when it has been fully restored and see the final product. \"The idea is to bring the building back to what it was in the 1880s,\" said Jeffrey Murphy of Murphy Burnham & Buttrick Architects, which is leading the design team overseeing the restoration work. \"When it's all done, it will be cleaner and lighter. ...

The first thing that will strike you when you cross 5th Avenue between 50th and 51st Street and you look at the amazing St. Patrick's Cathedral is the contrast between all the modern office buildings and the 135 years old Cathedral. It looks if time stood still when you are in front of the church. This Roman Catholic Cathedral, built in Neo-Gothic style, is one of the biggest in the world. It measures 110 meters long and 58 meters wide. The two towers at the front are 100 meters high and the ship inside is 36 meters high and 16 meters wide. The original site was bought in 1810 for $.11.000 where a Jesuit school and a chapel were built, which served later as an orphanage by Trappists. After the Trappists left, the chapel was reopened in 1840 by Bishop Dubois and a small church was built. It was only in 1853 that Archbishop John Joseph Hughes announced that a new Cathedral was going to replace the small church and was to be named Saint Patricks Cathedral. The building stared in 1858. The Cathedral was completed in 1878 and dedicated in 1879. A few years later an adjacent school was opened. In 1888 the spires were added and in 1900 they started building an addition on the east, including the beautiful Lady Chapel. The Cathedral was renovated between 1927 and 1931. The cathedral and associated buildings were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. In 2012 an extensive restoration of the cathedral was begun and is planned to last 3 years at a cost of $.177 million.St. Patricks Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan. Every year more than 5 million people enter the Cathedral and more then 1 million prayer candles are lit. There are seats for more than 2.400 people and mass is celebrated more than 2.400 times a year. The great stained glass windows and the bronze doors are impressive. The Lady Chapel, behind the main sanctuary, is a place for prayer, where picture taking is not allowed. The painting of The Lady Guadalupe at the Altar of the Sacred Heart at the right of the main sanctuary is the most visited place of the Cathedral. A basement crypt behind the altar is the burial place of every New York Archbishop and the remains of Pierre Touissant, who was an Haitian Catholic slave.Masses were held here for New York Yankees Babe Ruth and Billy Martin, football legend Vince Lombardi, singer Celia Cruz, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and for many of 9/11's fallen police and firefighters. A visit to St. Patrick's Cathedral is highly recommended.TIPS-> There are several masses each day, some of them with music. Sometimes they are broadcasted on local channels;-> There are free public tours of the Cathedral on select days beginning at 10 a.m. and daily services are free and open to the public;-> On the right side after the entrance there is a small gift shop (The Annex), selling a small selection of medals, rosary beads and post cards. The main gift shop is located across the street from the Cathedral on 51st Street-> You can still visit the old St. Patricks Old Cathedral, located at 260\u2013264 Mulberry Street between Prince and Houston Streets in the Nolita neighborhood;"

This was one of the few things that my partner specifically cited as wanting to see while in NYC, so we ended up going to the Mass at 9AM to check it out. The Mass was surprisingly good for a cathedral that doubles as a tourist attraction: on the website it noted that the 9AM service had \"music\" (the one at 10AM has a choir), and we weren't really sure what that meant, but it turned out that they had a solo singer for the hymns/songs. She was quite good and made the service much more enjoyable. The Mass was great and I don't have any complaints about it.The cathedral in general, however, is currently under some pretty substantial renovations. My partner was really disappointed since it was something he had been looking forward to for a while, and while I knew that the cathedral was undergoing renovations I was still surprised at the extent of the construction. If you're in the area there is absolutely no reason to stop in and take a look around, but at this point it is still pretty much impossible to get a good view of the overall architecture of the building from the outside or the inside. Until renovations are complete or at least scaled back, I would put this under as a \"low-priority\" attraction."

If you plan to return to New York in the future, you may want to save this site for another time, but if you don't plan to return, definitely go see it while you're here. If there is no mass service in progress, you can walk all around, even behind the main altar.

It is a huge church embodying the beautiful meaning, architecture and religious connotations of Catholicism. It.s beauty does not only span from its external monumental architecture, but goes deep inside into the details of every tile, every stone and every religious icon.You need to enjoy what this cathedral symbolizes by checking all its sections. Start by the entrance on 5th avenue and walk your way towards the main hall and then behind the altars towards the chapel in the back. On your way out walk closer to the sides of the church and check all the scriptures, statues, icons....it is breathtaking. I can only imagine how beautiful mass is on Christmas at St. Patrick.sI know that most people associate New York wit the statue of liberty, central park and other tourist attractions, but trust me St. Patrick's deserves its own share and is definitely a site to visit while you are in NYC. You can't miss it as you will be passing in front of it anyway you would be going on 5th avenue.I have visited on many instances, it is currently being renovated on the outside and parts on the inside, so not all parts might be clearly visible but it is definitely highly recommended"

The tributes to a number of Saints are beautiful. The main altar is quite handsome while the small sanctuary behind it, which was being used for a baptism when I visited, is welcoming. The Church bring bring mixed emotions for me. On the one hand it brought to mind parts of Catholicism that brought me comfort as a child. On the flip side, it reminded me of so much of the wealth behind the Church. Nonetheless, it is a MUST visit for anyone visiting NY."

I was raised Catholic, but I think anyone who likes religious buildings, stained glass, statues, shrines, architecture, candles, etc. would find it worth visiting. They don't build churches like this anymore in the USA. Mass was in session Saturday evening when I wandered in, but the ushers didn't mind funneling the visitors around the edges of the church to look at the numerous shrines. Donate a couple dollars and light a small candle at your favorite shrine (I chose the Polish saints). There is a lot of scaffolding around the edges because of the refurbishing that is going on, but you can walk under it. When mass is not in progress, you can walk up to the altar and look at the detail of the art work. People around the edges were quietly chatting and taking pictures. Sit in on the mass. If you're Catholic, maybe you can even take the gifts up, if you talk to the right person. There is a small gift shop in the corner of the interior, but about a block away is their larger gift shop. They have the most affordable and meaningful souvenirs I was able to find in NYC. Many were less than $10, and most were labeled with the name of the cathedral. I got some Christmas shopping done (in July). There were bracelets, rosaries, items to use when praying for those with cancer, addictions, and other troubles; nativity sets from around the world, small stained glass reproductions of the windows in the cathedral, and many unique items that you won't see elsewhere in the city. My 20-year-old daughter, who is not very religious, made this one of the first places we visited when I arrived in NYC. It doesn't cost a thing, and there is a lot to look at. There are tours that you can go on if you arrive at the right time."

The statues of saints inside are wonderful, each one having a place to light candles.There is also a small souvenir shop inside with beautiful pieces to purchase as keepsakes or as gifts for your loved ones.The location is on 5th Avenue, nearer the Central Park end of the town. This is a must see for anyone visiting New York."

They are the same as far as religious devotion is concerned and that is of course the primary purpose.

And I have to say, St. Patrick strikes me as excessive, as in just full of stuff, but not nearly as impressive as, say, St. John the Divine, and lacking in a sense of quiet and peace that most great churches have. Maybe it's the setting, and the fact that it's so popular that it is always full of huge crowds of tourists. But I would much rather visit other churches in New York City at this point."

After we checked into the hotel and spent some time trying to figure out directions, we started our first sightseeing. We have never been to this church in our past visits to the city. It was a busy Sunday afternoon, and we were surprised to find the 135-year-old church under substantial three-year, $175 million dollar renovation. The exterior spires were covered by unsightly scaffold.The construction of a new St. Patrick's Cathedral between Madison Ave. and Fifth Ave., and 50th and 51st Streets started in 1958 and completed in 1878. The delay was due to the Civil War. The Neo-Gothic-style Roman Catholic cathedral church was designed by architect James Renwick. More structures were added in later years such as the spires were added in 1888, and the construction of Lady Chapel begun in 1900 with its famous stained-glass created between 1912 and 1930.We went in the church through two huge bronze doors while they were having a Sunday Mass. The cathedral can hold more than 2,000 people. The beautiful Lady Chapel is behind the Crypt. However, no photography is allowed. There are many altars along the sides of the walls. The Gallery Organ has 5,918 pipes, and the Chancel Organ has 3,920 pipes. Currently, the Gallery Organ was temporarily relocated since June 2012 due to the renovation, so we have to wait until the renovation is completed in late 2014 or 2015 to enjoy the Kilgen Organ Recital Series."

However, when we went after Christmas, it was open to the public, and we went inside. All I could say is \"Wow!\" If you're in the area, this is worth a visit. The Christmas decorations were still up, and that really added something to the already beautiful place. There were various alcoves where you could light a candle for someone, and I did just that. There was a beautiful manger, and one of the church volunteers gave a nice talk about St. Patrick's. One of the things he said that stuck with me was that when you enter the cathedral, and look up, it feels like you're looking up to heaven (with the vastness of the ceilings). Very true! When you enter, realize that you're in a church, and keep the noise level down. Also, follow the church rules. A great visit!"

They are then posted to you in late November. While I did apply for these tickets in September and I sent a self addressed envelope, the tickets did not arrive in Australia before I left for my holiday. I went to the Parish office and explained the situation. Fortunately, they were able to provide me with 2 tickets. A hint for travellers when applying for tickets in September, ask that the tickets be posted to the hotel where you will be staying and then ask the hotel to hold the tickets until you arrive. It will save a lot of bother. The mass was beautiful and will hold special memories for me for a long time. I can thoroughly recommend this experience."

There is no one there to remind people to keep their voices down, to be respectful of the statues, People were taking picutes and videos like it was Santa and not our savior. I am sure the church thrives on donations to keep it running, especially the heating bill since the doors of the church are left open on 35degree days, however there are donation collection boxes every 5 feet. I felt I was in the wrong place to sit and have a minute of prayer. I feel they have lost the intergity of the church in lieu of the option for hundreds of visitors and their donations.

Though covered with scaffolding, we enjoyed the experience just as much as times previously. It just so happened that Christmas mass was just about to begin as we walked down the center aisle of this majestic cathedral. What a great place to spend Christmas day! We sang Christmas carols, lit a candle for those in need, offered a few prayers, took communion, and most importantly, worshipped our Lord Jesus Christ in this glorious cathedral, as thousands have done before us. Located just a short walk from busy Rockefeller Center with all the ice-skaters, this respite was a meaningful and welcomed stop, particularly on Christmas day, 2012."

Currently, the church is under restoration so much of its inherent charm is lost amongst the scaffolding and other construction material. But once you get past that, it is a beautiful church and certainly worth a visit for all people and all faiths. If you want, go to mass too. Check out their scheduled and the languages that are being offered. Also, make sure that you really look at the schedule. If you have a hectic day planned, you don't want to go to mass when the Archbishop is there. We went to church at noon and it was normal. Sit in the front - which means you should get there early. Sitting in the front gives you a bird's eye view of the altar and all the happenings during mass. I love sitting in the front in any church. Even if you don't there are monitors that maybe on throughout the mass and certainly speakers strategically placed so you can hear.Before mass (or after), tour the church. It is likely that there will be another mass happening when you are touring but if you have been to the Vatican, you know what it is like to be at mass with hundreds of people walking and taking pictures. If you go while the church is getting its facelift, look past the work to see the gothic beauty. You do not find many churches like this in the States. Soak it in. If you have never been to Europe, this is a good idea of what you would see in some of the truly 13th century gothic churches you would find there.PSA - If you are inclined, donate to the church itself. The costs to maintain the building, I imagine, are enormous. Every little bit helps. Regardless of whether you are Catholic or not, this is a landmark that should be preserved and kept for all New Yorkers and all visitors of New York."

Knowledge of Catholicism is not a requirement to enjoy every aspect of this sanctuary.I only wish that they had a system just like that used across the street at the Rockefeller Center tour. There the docent had a headset and each of us had earphone receivers so that you could hear every word. I am sure the church could not go to the expense (the church tour was free) Of course donations were more than acceptable."

What I loved most about this site was the interior walls of the cathedral, which were lined with patron saints. Each section has designated areas where guests can light a candle and sit/kneel and pray before their patron saint, such as St. Therese. In summary, visit St. Patrick's Cathedral if you want a nice quiet moment away from the hustle and bustle of NYC."

One of the best examples of gothic art outside Europe.Please remind that is not a museum, some respect is requested for the tourists toward the people attending a religious service."

High ceiling and a rather spectacular Lady Guadalupe, which is one of the main attraction for most people. It's the most quiet serene place you can actually sit and pray. You can light a candle for prayers or fill your bottle with holy water. There are free scheduled guides and walk in guided tours. There's a small chapel inside the church, no cameras allowed, if you don't want to be disturbed in your prayers. I've had a wnderful experience and it's a shame that I'm from the city and never even bother to visit more often."

St. Patrick's is such a beautiful Cathedral that when the organ began with wonderful music filling the air, I was so moved that it surprised me. As a Catholic of Irish extraction, I could not visit New York without visiting here. This is a place of worship and pilgrimage for me, not a tourist destination, so I am surprised at the tone of some of the reviews in here. The vast majority of visitors treated their time here with reverence, although I was disappointed at the number of men who did not remove their headgear. The artifacts adorning the cathedral were works of art in themselves, whilst all being holy items.We also went to mass on the Sunday. Being Memorial Weekend, mass was said by the Cardinal and 5 priests with at least two from the visiting Fleet. Readings were by a Naval Officer and a Marine Officer and the enlisted men attending filled several rows. We sang \"America the Beautiful\" as the recessional hymn. This rounded off our visit to this magnificent country, with its friendly, beautifully mannered people. This moving service gave us a glimpse into the American soul and we gained some understanding of why they are the leading nation in the world. (And I am not particularly a fan of the USA, at least prior to this visit!)"

This view (thumbnail I'm seeing as I write this; front of the Cathedral) , and where you're looking at the front, is from 5th Avenue. Just being here is a tourist destination in itself. Opposite the cathedral is Rockefeller Center, with its mall, statue of Atlas, skating pond, and NBC studios. Not to mention miles of elegant (and not inexpensive) shoppes and impressive store windows. And mobs of people, especially at Holiday/tourism times.The inside is amazingly beautiful, as is/would be the outside too. I mention this because at present (July 2012) the front is being repaired and is covered by scaffolding. Just saying, in case getting a photo of the front is a major goal. (On the steps in front of the door is a lovely photo).Inside - and I'm sure you can find photos - it's very much like some other elegant traditional churches of Europe - and it is open to the public most of the time. When I walked in with a friend (out for a walk-about Manhattan) we found ourselves observing an actual wedding. Awesome.Candles, incense, etc., all behind the back of the pews (front of the church) with various educational pamphlets and signs, plus (of course) a collection place. No entry fee to just poke your head in and see it. And as I've said, it's right in the midst of 5th Avenue/Midtown Manhattan, close to \"everything\", from music halls (e.g., Carnegie Hall) to designer clothing/jewelry (e.g.,Tiffany's) to a flagship Apple Store, to the Plaza Hotel, Central Park, etc., etc. Depending on your love of walking...."

It could be that the churches of Italy are so heavily traveled and toured that they cannot retain their holiness despite their grandeur and hundreds of years of history. When we walked up the aisle underneath the center dome it was almost as if you could hear the angels singing.... the architecture and height are breathtaking, and the staff and security very strictly enforce the quiet policy. Not that it seemed to be an issue, because almost every soul that walked through the doors was silenced and awestruck by the majesty of St. Patrick's. It would be a dream to get married within the walls of this epic cathedral. Don't miss it on your walk up 5th Avenue."

Sit in the pews for awhile and just take it all in: the stained glass, the stone and wood, the architecture, the people around you. I enjoyed sitting in quiet meditation and even lit a candle (for a donation of a few dollars) and said a prayer for someone special. Spend 1/2 hour or so unless you want to take in a mass. I went alone; families would be okay too but just ensure your children remain with you, quiet, and respectful. Don't forget to walk back around the altar for a pieta and more."

I wanted to visit this church because I had heard Regis Philbin refer to it quite often when he hosted his talk show. The church is undergoing cleaning. However, I still got a good picture of its twin towers soaring into the sky. The quiet interior of this church gave me a comforting feeling with its dark woods, many beautifully stained glass windows and floral arrangements at the entrance and the altar. As I passed by the Stations of the Cross and the many niches with carved statuary devoted to the saints, I did not have time on this short visit to read the information about each saint. Flash photography is allowed inside. The church, opening early and closing late, has a helpful website for planning a visit and to be a part of the services."

At the very front of the Cathedral past the altar there's an area where no photos are supposed to be taken but plenty of other areas inside where you can take photos.

We attended the 8:00AM service and it was full, but it was still very easy to find a seat and enjoy the service from one of the many television monitors mounted in the church. I was actually surprised at how quickly communion was dispersed given how many people were in the actual service. I'm not sure if this is a norm for service, but they were randomly checking bags in the lobby as you came in, and I did not find any problem with that at all. I thought it was a beautiful chuch and service and I would definitely return."

One gentleman handed me his own palms made into a cross - which was so kind of him. One of the other men told us to wait a minute and ran back into the cathedral. He returned with a huge bundle of palms and gave them to us. He said they had an oversupply of them. We were overwhelmed! What a beautiful souvenir for our friends and family!!

The minute you step into this church, you are transformed to a world so much quieter, sane and peacuful from the super busy 5th avenue. The design and architecture is commendable. It may not be Roman, but no less either. It is beautiful in its own right. It is huge, yet never noisy. People/tourists are always walking inside, taking pictures and admiring the sculptures and the statues. There is a statue of Mary and Christ behind the main altar(in the center) which is larger than life and my favorite. Everyone finds something here and leaves with an unexplained sense of peace. You don't even have to be religious, you just have to be here. If you are in Newyork city visiting, this is definitely a must see. This is also a popular background spot on tv series and movies. Visit during Chritsmas, even better. You can add the icing of the famous NY christmas tree just across the street at yet another famous NY site - The Rockefeller center. Hope you enjoy your visit."

There are several masses on Sunday morning, so you have plenty of opportunities to work it into your schedule. The 7:00 am mass was not very crowded and there wasn\u2019t any music, but it was a very nice service. I just think it\u2019s simply amazing that, every year, more than five million people of every different nationality and faith enter this Cathedral. Even if you don\u2019t have time to attend mass, just visit the church \u2013 the architectural work alone is amazing. Also, there\u2019s a small gift shop in the church, and another larger gift shop about a block away. I purchased a beautiful pink rosary for a coworker of mine for $25. She loved it! There are altars/shrines that line both sides of the church, where you can pray and light candles. Most of the shrines contain information about the saint it honors. Very interesting, even if you are not Catholic or Christian. If you are there during the Christmas/Advent season, the Nativity scene is very beautiful, and can be found to the left of the sanctuary.Don\u2019t miss this beautiful cathedral! Be sure to stop in and look around, say a prayer, light a candle, and be amazed and spiritually moved...bb"

A large and impressive, gothic style cathedral, more suitable for mainland Europe than the United States, St. Patrick's made a nice stop for us during our recent trip to NYC. We were impressed with the scale of the church, now squeezed between blocks of tall NYC buildings, finding the interior to be nice but not particularly amazing. We were half expecting to find gargoyles on the outside but we couldn't spot any, perhaps due to not looking hard enough (or maybe they don't have them) and we would have liked to have seen a bit more stained glass in St. Patrick's, just another personal preference we have with the gothic style churches. As we have nothing like this in Hong Kong, St. Patrick's was definitely enjoyable for us for a quick stop and was our second favorite church visit only behind Trinity Church and its wonderful historic graveyard, near Wall Street and the financial district in lower Manhattan. Overall, St. Patrick's is a pretty good attraction if you enjoy visiting churches and colossal old buildings. It will remind you of gothic cathedrals you may have seen in Italy or other places in Europe which makes it quite unique for NYC and much of the United States for that matter. Thus, its worth a few moments of your time to stop and see St. Patrick's while visiting the Midtown area of NYC."

I took the time to sit at the Lady's chapel ( only section where there are no pictures allowed) and I found myself praying to Jesus. Truly a solemn place in an otherwise not so quiet church. There was no service at the time. My favorite statue was of Jesus in the arms of his mother, which is on the right side of the chapel.As a native New Yorker, I am surprised that it took me this long to visit this church but it was worth my time."

St Pat's is styled after the most impressive churches in Europe, it's a wonderful amalgam of English, French & German styles. The side altars are lovely, each with prie-dieux should you wish to stop and say a prayer. Make sure to stop at the Lady Chapel, it's lovely enough to merit a visit by itself. The baptistry is huge, the confessional truly intimidating. The stained glass is awesome ~ in the true, old sense of the word. The main altar and baldachin are humbling. Give yourself an hour to wander. Also, the gift shop at the rear has nifty souvenirs and the profits help maintain the building, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless and so forth. Or, at least make a donation. Please remember : this is an active church. Be respectful, turn off your cell phone, speak quietly, walk solemnly and turn off your flash ~ you won't need it anyway (see my pics). Even if there is not a Mass being said at that moment, someone is nonetheless praying. That being said, to really get the feel of the Church, sit or kneel and say a prayer. No one will mind."

It is just around the corner from Rockefeller Center & is a nice place to step in off the streets on a cold winter night. We often stop in here after viewing the Rockefeller Center Tree. Our last visit to St. Patrick's was on Sunday December 6th 2009. We happened to visit the church while a mass was going on. They hold 8 masses on Sunday alone. Sometimes we have seen several people doing the mass, but this time there was only one person giving the mass. Some of the masses have music, while others do not. You can check the bulletin or web site for this information & schedule.The inside of the church is massive, so you will see TV's placed throughout so everyone can see the mass speaker. Also it sounded like the had an overhead speaker system to amplify the voice of the speakers. There are tall pillars, lots of detailed wood work, stained glass windows, beautiful statues, marvelous arches and sometimes we have seen a nativity scene displayed near the front of the church. The outside of the church is just as stunning as the inside. They really paid great attention to detail when this church was built in the mid to late 1800's.Anyone can visit this church, regardless of their religion. St. Patrick's welcomes Catholics, fellow Christians and non-Christians to their celebrations. However, if you are not catholic, you will not be admitted to Holy Communion. But, anyone can visit, view a mass, offer their prayers, and revel in the wonder of this great architecture. It is completely FREE to visit the church, unless you wish to give a donation or light a candle. The cathedral is open form 6:30am to 8:45pm daily if you wish to visit in person. It looks like their 8 o'clock mass is recorded and telecast on local TV stations too.Overall, St. Patrick's is a nice place to stop and rest. We have visited here many times. It is nice to visit the shops and stores during the busy winter holiday season. But it is nice to stop and take in the beauty of this church too. It is a nice place to rest on a pew and take in the solitude of this magnificent building. It is a nice quiet place to warm up & relax in peace before heading back into the hustle & bustle of the Manhattan crowds. Note: This is still a cathedral, so it is important to be respectful of the church. We have witnessed guards asking people to remove their hats as a common courtesy. Also, they may ask to search your bag or back pack & to leave any open drinks outside."
