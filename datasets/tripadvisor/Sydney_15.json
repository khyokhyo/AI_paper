Inexpensive, relaxing, and right near an amazing playground too in Darling Harbour. A lovely morning out with the kids."

Ornate buildings and beautiful history await you. If you get there by 11:30a, you can participate in the daily koi fish feeding (BIGGEST koi I have seen in my life, could swear they eat steaks for dinner lol).

It is a beautiful place that although is surrounded by a road, other buildings and people passing, once you enter you leave the world outside. You become immersed in the spectacular views and peace consumes you. There is plenty of places you can sit and just watch the birds and time pass. Unfortunately there is a negative, the little cafe they have although is gorgeous inside with so many wonderful displays we found that the cakes were not wonderful, a bit dry and on the stale side, however have a lovely cup of tea and sit and watch the fish. The views surround you, go and enjoy."

Decided to visit the Chinese Garden of Friendship before even heading to Sydney as it was a cheap type of entry and was in Darling Harbour area, boy were we not disappointed. There is so much packed into such a small area. Honestly if there is one thing to do outside the normal touristy things to do this is it. Do yourself a favour, take in the greenery, peace and quiet of the gardens. On the day we visited it was very overcast and a slight misty rain, but there is plenty to see and plenty of undercover places to wait until it is dry....also keep an eye out for the chinese characters....tiger, rat, dragon etc.... hidden and fun to find."

Lizards bask on the rocks in the sun never far from the water that flows through the garden. There is even a waterfall which can be viewed from both the bottom and the top as you make you way round the paths and up to the ornamental pagoda. It only takes an hour to work your way around the garden but it is easy to linger for longer as every corner gives a different view of the gardens. Near the end of the path is a tea room where you can sit a while longer and enjoy the pond view.Keep your eyes open and you will spot a few visiting birds sharing the gardens with you. A must see for keen gardeners and those wanting a calm place to rest a while."

If you are in Sydney and exhausted by all the construction work that is going on or tired of all the high rise or maybe the hustle and bustle escape to the Chinese garden located between Darling Harbour and China Town. In one of the pavilions you will find a Yin Yang symbol which is perfect to illustrate the opposing busy city with a tranquil garden. In fact when you are close to one of the many water features you are unable to hear the noise of the city which is literally just the other side of the wall. Whilst only a visitor to Sydney, if I lived there I would visit these gardens every week just to simply escape into a different world. This is one of my most favourite spots in Sydney."

It is beautiful, peaceful, well appointed, and maintained. It's a nice stop if you visit Chinatown. Lots of ibises nesting. (Watch out above your head). Takes about an hour, but could sit and relax longer. There is also a tea garden, but we didn't have time to stay."

For an adult to get into an attraction for under $10 is a great bargain nowadays. But to spend nearly 3 hours there is an absolute steal. They have a place you can hire traditional chinese costumes and get dressed up in, then take your own pictures or the attendant will take some for you if you ask nicely. Our 6 yr old granddaughter had an absolute ball walking around all dressed up. Even got a bit of special attention at the very nice cafe they have in the garden. Food was tasty and wasn't the usual over the top price at all. We visited on a Sunday and there was activities happening (free) including demonstrations. One such was 3 chinese girls playing traditional chinese instruments. Our 6 yr old (still in costume) asked if she could have a pic taken with the girls, they said yes. They then allowed her to have a go at playing the instruments. The garden itself is worth the look but with the cafe and other things, best entertainment money can buy in Darling Harbour I reckon."

The many walkways took us around lovely landscaped gardens where beautiful waterfalls dropped into tranquil lakes. Golden carp swam amoungst the lillies and \"Lizzards\" roamed around the gardens or sat lazilly in the sun. There were a large number of native birds free to come and go as they pleased. We originally thought that we would be in the Gardens for an hour or so, but we stayed for several hours just walking around and unwinding. We ended our day sitting by the edge of a lake with a cup of hot chocolate and a scone from the Cafe, while watching the Golden Carp and a \"Lizzard\" that wandered around our feet waiting for nibbles \"accidently\" dropped by my wife."

We had taken a six hour tour of Sydney and the surrounding areas so yesterday we decided to walk around. My wife saw the gardens listed on a map so we decided to visit it. Much construction surrounding the gardens but upon entering ($6 p/p) we found ourselves emersed in the beauty and tranquility of a true Chinese garden. We spent about an hour here watching and listening to the nesting cranes and other birds, observing the beautiful Koi, and just relaxing. This was truly a wonderful experience and I highly recommend it if you have just a few hours to spend in Sydney."

The garden shows off traditional Chinese landscaping, architecture, culture, flora and fauna.

This is a must visit, for a nominal fee it can bee seen in approximately a half hour. My six year old enjoyed looking for the Chinese Zodiac animals and my wife and I enjoyed the fact it is impossible to take a bad picture here. This is a great option for an attraction that can be enjoyed before leaving for the airport."

There is a $6 entry fee but don't let that put you off. Once you walk around to the main area with the big lake the wow-factor will hit you. It took us about an hour to explore the gardens but even if you don't have much time it is worth it for a quick stroll. You'll certainly feel more relaxed when you leave. I should point out that there was some construction happening outside the gardens. The noise did detract from the experience, particularly around the edges of the garden. I would imagine this would be quite the tranquil place once the construction is finished."

We have heard of a \"zodiac treasure hunt\" where kids have to find the 12 Chinese zodiacs. It's 6 AUD entrance for an adult. I have to say, it's a nice little oasis in the middle of town. Yes, it's not big and some may call it boring but we actually enjoyed the short walk. Only problem: whilst they say that 70% is accessible with a stroller, it's probably less and some path are rather bumpy. But if you are on foot, go for it!"

There are free guided tours at 10:30am and 2:30pm everyday and a plant-specific tour around noon. We took the 10:30am tour. I would highly recommend the tour. It is a beautiful place on its own, but taking the tour lets you know about the history of the place. For example there is a dragon piece near the beginning... wonderful to look at, but we learned from the tour guide that the blue dragon represents Sydney in NSW and the brown dragon represents the Guangdong region of China and the ball they are both reaching for in the center represents their friendship. We wouldn't have known that without the tour! There was lots of other interesting information provided. The tour ran about 30 minutes, I think it was actually a little short, I would have liked a longer tour so we could have covered more of the gardens. But overall, would recommend to do and would go again if visiting Sydney in the future!"

As it was part of the Chinese New Year celebrations, entry was by gold coin donation and there was a wealth of activities to try out.I ended up doing the free Tai Chi class which was set in a room opposite the lake and was a beautiful setting to try Tai Chi. There were about 16 of us, and our teacher Fiona was a brilliant teacher.It lasted for one hour and I felt very relaxed afterwards and now eager to try this again. It would be lovely if this could occur every week and charge a small fee as I would love to come back and do it again.Before Tai Chi I had time to wander around the gardens. There was building work going on which meant it wasn't as peaceful as it could have been, but there are spots you can escape to where it is more quiet. It wasn't too busy whilst we were here and there are plenty of spots to sit down and forget about everything.The lake is also home to many Koi fish which were large in size and colourful to watch. There are bonsai trees and plenty of signs to read to gain a better understanding. You can also do a guided tour if you prefer which runs every day.Overall, a lovely hour or so enjoying the Chinese Garden of Friendship and a wonderful Tai Chi class."

The staff really bring the garden to life and highlight things that you would otherwise miss. Such a tranquil and beautiful location, don't miss it.

We've made several return visits over the years and this year stopped en route to the Powerhouse Museum. The entry price of $15 fora family of four is great value. Inside the gardens are still tranquil and pretty and the \"scavenger hunt\" project for kids is a great idea. Unfortunately the water seemed very green and murky and the giant carp barely visible in many parts of the park. The cascading waterfall down one side seemed to have gone - lack of water perhaps? And the opportunity to dress up in traditional kimono seems to have disappeared too. The little cafe still exists but was empty on this particular day. It was a bit sad to see such a nostalgic favourite neglected."

The gardens are just before the Pier Street exit out of the Darling Harbour area. Beautifully ornate, they are an oasis amongst the construction being carried out in Darling Harbour at the moment. Entry fee is $6 and in January they have school holiday activities for kids. This is one of the nicest things to see in the Darling Harbour area."

In fact we stumbled upon it by accident whilst working our way to Darling Harbour. But what a lucky find. For entrance of only $6 you are met with a little treasure of a garden that is as fascinating for its reptiles and fish as it is for its plants and ornate buildings. We took advantage of following the lovely guide Hayley around the garden who told us so much about its history and how traditionally the Chinese found such peace and tranquillity through many of the types of plants and exhibits found in the gardens. This place could easily be overwhelmed by the developments taking place all around it but it is worth taking a step away from the hustle and bustle of Darling Harbour to enjoy the peace of these gardens and of course take a glass of beer from the gardens cafe whilst admiring the Koi and wild birds that keep an interested eye upon them!"

This is for what is basically a 10 minute walk around a fake and mainly concrete replica of a Chinese garden. Don't go if you have mobility problems or a stroller - the paths are mainly uneven stone and there a quite a few precipitous stairs with no handrails. You cannot find a spot to sit down and contemplate the quite pretty views, because the multitude of ibis have fouled all the benches and no one has hosed them down. The ponds are dirty and full of leaves. The whole place feels neglected and that may be partly a result of the Darling Harbour redevelopment, but being one of the few attractions that is open, you'd think the management would make an effort. The cafe was mediocre - we felt we were interrupting the staff's down time. The whole place needs an upgrade."

I was listening to jazz music while walking around which I think helped eliminate the sound of the city and made me feel relaxed. I loved walking along the various pathways and being surprised by the garden landscape and features, especially the water features and buildings. If your in a rush to see the Sydney sites I might say give it a miss mainly because it's Chinese, not Australian origin but if your walking from Darling Harbour to China town it may improve your opinion of china town and if you do have the time to see the Garden I'm sure you will be very impressed and will enjoy it!"

Over 8 years I have been to Sydney 6 times and to the gardens more than 12 times. If I lived in the city I would go very often. It's a true oasis in the heart of the city and what ever the weather it's worth a visit. Whether you have an hour to spare, or half a day, it's the perfect place to relax and explore. At just $6 an adult entry it's a perfect place to visit. The tea room is lovely offering a range of teas, sandwiches, dim sum and cakes. It had a lovely view over the garden and you can site an unwind, and rest your feet whilst watching the koi and birds. A must place to visit when in Sydney and my favourite place on the planet."

It's more like a museum as there are traditional buildings and pottery displays. Huge water features and a lovely tea house on the premises serving a variety of Chinese tea and snacks as well as some western stuff. I spent hours here! There is a place where you can be dressed in imperial Chinese attire as well!This place seems to be about exchange and learning about Chinese culture. There are plaques everywhere explaining the gardens design and significance as a place symbolising the Chinese/Australian friendship. The women who dressed me were Chinese and they told me all about the clothes."

The Chinese garden (between the city and adjacent to Darling Harbor is a nice refuge from the city bustle, and for a small fee, you can spend an hour or two here looking at some attractive gardens and finding a bit out about Chinese culture in Sydney. You can even dress up if you want to, or just laugh at the people who did. They do feel a bit surrounded by the city buildings which are tending to encroach."

We found the staff at the entrance to be so helpful and friendly.We decided to have the scones and tea, would not elect to do this again. The scones were reheated in the microwave and the cream was a pressure spray pack variety. Not pram friendly in parts and there is the option for a free guided tour if you time your visit well."

We were also very lucky in that we managed to arrive just as the free tour was starting (12pm and 2pm every day) so we got a detailed history of the origins and design of this unique space as well.Ming was a wonderful guide; you could tell she knew the garden like the back of her hand but that she was also genuinely passionate about it.

It's a maze of paths, alcoves and steps around a central Lake of Brightness. The beautiful tress and shrubs, combined with the buildings and water features, offer a sanctuary from the busy Sydney life. Walk to the Southern end of the Darling Harbour precinct (past the iMax theatre) and you will find this large garden. It costs $6 for entry (concessions for pensioners, children and groups). I would say most of the area is accessible for less mobile or wheelchair bound people, apart from some of the steps up to the top.There are very clean toilets and a small coffee shop which also offers some traditional Chinese food (e.g. steamed pork buns, etc)."

We have popped in to see it mature a few times since then, but not for a long time. So it was lovely to spend 30 minutes or so there again on a recent trip to Sydney. The price of entry also seems to be lower than the last time we visited, so that was a pleasant surprise.The gardens definitely have matured over the years, and for the most part they are quite beautiful, particularly around the lake. Weeping willows and strategically placed pagodas make for many ideal photo spots. With sun dappling the water through the willows, it was momentarily easy to forget you were in the city. But momentarily is the word. Tranquility in scenery is all there, but the noise of the surrounding city and nearby building works do intrude. Maybe once the Darling Harbour construction work is finished, that complete sense of calm and serenity will return, but given the garden's location, that may be a bit much to ask for.We love visiting gardens, and this really is a charming one; however, some of the garden beds could do with a little extra TLC. Overall, though, it is very well maintained.A person could spend more time visiting the Chinese garden, and perhaps take some time at the tea house, but we didn't linger. The garden is not huge, but it does cram a lot into a very small space. So you are able to see everything fairly quickly if you just want to take a quick walk through, or you can take your time and many photos.A word of caution, though. The paving throughout the garden is not even, so this would not be a great place to bring granny with her walking frame. Even the lower part of the garden, near the entrance, has the same cobbled pathway, so it could be a little risky for anyone with walking difficulties.Other than that, the Chinese Garden of Friendship really is an inexpensive and enjoyable way to spend a little time on a lovely Sydney day. If I worked in the city, I would probably pay the very low annual fee and go regularly for a peaceful lunchtime."

The tea and scones in the tea house were surprisingly delicious (I was expecting the furniture and room decor to be more traditional - but I'm in Australia not China so how much can you really ask for?) I would've loved to have been a child again, pretending to be Mulan and playing through the gardens wouldve been so fun! It's not enormous, so if you don't sit to admire the scenery for a while or go to the tea house then you won't need more than an hour there. However it was nice to step outside of the city and be somewhere else (though you can see the tall buildings towering over the walls, and when I went there was construction happening somewhere nearby and it was incredibly loud) Perhaps they could play some tranquil traditional Chinese music throughout the gardens, to help reduce the distractions from the city. Overall though I did love it there and I plan to go again when I am visited by relatives. Hopefully there won't be as many people next time. Highly recommended!"

Sit down and close your eyes ... it won't take long for you to become really relaxed.Before you leave, enjoy a cup of Chinese tea in the tea room - there's a great variety of teas to choose from ... and the service is terrific."

After waiting for my friend to come back from a sailing trip at Darling Harbour, we started walking to Chinatown and discovered this beautiful garden. It reminded me of the gardens I visited in Soochow, China. The bonsai display near the entrance was beautiful, the landscaping, the pond, the Chinese structures are all so picturesque! I would recommend anyone visiting Sydney to spend some time at this place, it is truly a nice change from the crowds and noises from the big city!"

Today that changed when I took a 15 and 11 year old to lunch at darling harbour. I didn't expect much and was thoroughly shocked to have an amazing time I can't believe this amazing garden exists in the city. The employees were helpful and had my kids engaged from the beginning we looked for all the zodiac signs hidden around the gardens seen turtles, lizards, fish and ducks.Next time I'm going to take a picnic."

These magnificent gardens were a gift to Australia during from the Chinese government and are a truly peaceful and calming place amid the chaos of the city. Located at the Chinatown end of Darling Harbour, they provide a place to stroll, rest and refuel.The gardens are designed to be viewed from many different vantage spots and offer a changing range of vistas throughout the seasons. There is a cover charge but it is worth it. The garden is well laid out with access for disabled but the access is not across the whole garden.Having taken children there they love it so many places to explore. Just make sure you word them up about not being too rowdy. There are clean restrooms and a tea house. Make sure you wear sensible foot wear as there are uneven surfaces. Bring a camera and have fun taking shots through the window and arbors that dot the garden."

Had a lovely time at the Chinese Garden of Friendship.This was on the list of things to see on a recent five night stay in Sydney.Located at the end of Darling Harbour, due to building around it I had to negotiate a scenic route to find it. Would have been easier coming in from the Harbour end than the Chinatown end.The Gardens are very pretty and as I was with friends who wanted the guided tour I also took the tour which was included in the $6.00 entry fee and was very informative delivered by a friendly young man.There is a cafe located in the gardens that did lovely scones jam and cream and coffee, amongst the other items on the menu. Was lovely sitting in the outdoor area even though we had quite a heavy shower of rain.Would go back to the gardens to experience the peace and enjoy the buildings, fish and water features"

Ok pros first:it was nicely situated in the heart of Sydney's darling harbor.It is fabulously decorated inside and gives you the feel like you are in the country and not in the middle of such a built up city.Very calming and peaceful atmosphere.Cons:Very expensive for what it has.Much smaller than i expected.BE CAREFUL: They have a facility where you can put on traditional Japanese clothes. There is a sign outside which says something like \"dress up inside\" or something like that. So we decided to do this and believe me, it made for amazing and funny pictures which I will have with me forever. It made the experience way more enjoyable walking around in these clothes. However, when we went back to hand back the clothes and collect our bags, we were surprised to hear that we had to pay in order to put on those clothes. Not once did they mention prices or were prices seen on the sign. If i remember properly it was 10 dollars each just to wear those clothes. If those clothes were included in the admission price I would have recommended everyone go just for the amazing pictures we got alone but overall it ended up being a very expensive trip and you wouldn't spend long there, max 1 hour. We left the garden feeling that it was extremely overpriced."

It's easy to see why a number of couples choose this inner-city spot to hold their weddings.We also came across the costume hire venue in the gardens which was an amazing way to entertain ourselves (being aged between 45 and 71). For a small hire of $10 per adult we were dressed like Chinese Royalty (complete with ice packs under the costumes to keep us cool on a 30degree day).

We encountered several tame lizards as well! Flowers were blooming though it was February when we visited, and they added to the beauty. The garden sits right in the heart of the city, just off Darling Harbor, so it's possible to see the skyscrapers over the tops of the trees--but the garden is so beguiling and soothing that the city sights almost seem like an illusion. It was hot the day we visited, and strolling along the shady paths of the garden provided a restful break from the heat and noise outside. This truly is a sanctuary.

Entry was by small fee and we entered next to the exquisite bonsai display then mounted the path through a circular gateway to a chain of ponds with landscaped hills and small delicate temple-like shelters. A short walk up beside the waterfall and around descending through the rocks and on to the tea room which serves refreshing scones, cakes and pastries and tea or coffee all reasonably priced. This place is truly a tranquil haven."

You can get dressed up too if you like, and I've seen plenty of adults getting into it!

It's worth taking time to just be at one with yourself in this garden. The majestic city towers as a backdrop but in the garden there is only tranquil beauty. Slow down, stroll, don't rush through, notice the undulating stone, the lattice work where you are hidden from view, wait for the lizards to pop up and the turtles to cast a lazy eye on you.You cannot see the whole of the garden from any one place, such is the quality of it's design. We walked my son and I, Jasmine drifting on the breeze and the hint of another culture strong in our minds. At the end of the walk I was calm, serene and happy and also truly grateful for the opportunity to be there. We ended our walk in the Pagoda overlooking the pool and time stood still for me as I looked at my first born and knew I would remember this moment forever."

It is such a little Oasis of tranquillity and beauty right in the middle of a bustling and busy city. The entry fee is $6 adult and $3 child (under 12)The gardens are not huge, so easy to walk around (although wheelchair access only being good in the lower regions and not into the steeper sections) The various vantage points across the ponds and lake are beautiful. It really is a feast for the eyes. The Lotus flowers were imposing and the many dragonflies delightful. The water dragons were also a great sight sitting on the rocks. Even a baby duckling wandered bravely around. There is a sense of calm and serenity throughout the gardens and multiple seating areas to sit and relax a while.My visit was early in the morning, so people traffic was at a minimum which I would recommend to get the real sense of beauty and peace. If you are looking for a bit of fun, you can dress up in traditional costume and have your photo taken and if you are on the peckish side, there is a well priced Teahouse where you can sit and view large koi and turtles in the surrounding waters. A bit of heaven for a nature photographer.I would recommend it for all ages."

It's a token gesture, kindly bestowed on Sydney by the chinese government in the Bicentennial year, and well maintained in the 20-odd years since. It is, however, more of a pocket park than a garden and will really appeal to a) garden buffs and b) families with smaller children.There are other, larger asian styled gardens in Australia, but my feeling is that if you are here from overseas with limited time you should spend your garden viewing time in the beautiful Royal Botanic Gardens rather than here.Sydney visitors should go at least once, especially while your family is young. Then give it a big tick and move on :-)"

It's open till 5.30pm and has a beautiful calm and peaceful setting inside in the heart of the bustling city. The stark contrast can be seen by the towering buildings being constructed outside. As soon as you come in you can feel the cool air under the canopy setup throughout the garden. They have a water stream encircling the whole garden and different lakes,ponds and a small waterfall spread around with the different beautiful and quiet settings where you can rest peacefully or spend time with people. There are different birds and fishes inside and different plants as well. They have interesting stuff to read along the way as well. You can rent some Chinese clothing inside if you are more involved. It's not your typical 'garden' so don't expect different exotic varieties of flora on display in order. It's a nice quaint ecosystem where you can relax and let your mind ease. It's definitely a place worth spending time at to take refuge from the scorching summer heat."

There is a welcoming tea room with great scones etc and toilets on site. If you are feeling adventurous head to the costume hire and dress like an Emperor or his wife and walk amongst the gardens. The costs is $10 for adults and $5 for children. There are photo opportunities around every corner. There are regular guided tours by friendly English speaking guides. I hope that Sydney will support this location way into the future. It was a great escape from the hustle and bustle and definitely a place of friendship."

My second visit to this beautiful place, I highly recommend spending some down time here instead of running around Darling Harbour, Chinatown or Paddy's Markets.Minimal entry fee and you can come & go as many times you want the same day.Interesting features to read about, find out about the Chinese calendar and what the animals are supposed to signify. Spot the lizards in the gardens, there are some big ones there. Spend some time staring at the water features or the koi, walk up the hill and admire the view.Shame when there is noisy shows on just outside, ruins the peace of the garden.If you don't get something out of this garden you are just tight with your money (complaining about having to pay to get in - there is a lot of maintenance required for the upkeep) and have lost touch with part of yourself. Highly recommended!"

This time I was afraid I wouldn't get there again but had an hour till my ride to the airport and it was very close to my hotel so I ran over. Ever so glad I did. This is a magnificent Chinese garden. (Very similar to one in downtown Portland, OR, USA). It is beautiful, serene and in October it smelled great too. In some places in the garden you would never know you are in a bustling city like Sydney. In other locations you can see the tall buildings looming overhead. As I said I only had an hour so didn't read much about the garden and the various venues inside. The few I did read were similar to the garden in Portland. I think this is a must see in Sydney."

It is well worth paying the small entry fee to walk around the pathways, beside the water and under the trees. The brochure and the display panels in the garden provide information about the various structures, the plants and the garden features. On the day we visited a number of visitors had paid to hire Chinese costumes and seeing these 'dressed-up' characters walking among the shrubbery added to the charm. It's definitely worth a visit!"

But we ended up lingering for maybe three hours, exploring the different sections and searching for the cute Chinese zodiac creatures that were scattered throughout the garden. The architecture and landscaping is superb, with every single aspect perfectly designed to be beautiful from every perspective. The sound of running water from the lake and waterfalls cut through all the city noise, to the point where you forgot you were even in the city. The koi in the lake were fabulous too - one of them kept leaping out of the water! We also had pork buns and oolong tea at the little cafe on site, which was lovely. It was nice to be given a choice of different Chinese teas, rather than just one.The only negative I can think of was how many people had scratched their names into the bamboo."

But that would be doing it entirely the wrong way.For a surprisingly small fee, you can buy an entry ticket with a cafe voucher that will get you some dim sims and a hot green tea. Step 1: Go the cafe first (counter-clockwise from the entrance), order your dimmys then relax for a while in the Teahouse outdoor dining area while you soak up the atmosphere.Step 2: Retrace your steps (clockwise) past the entrance and head up to the costume hire chamber. For just $10 you will be dressed in a rather impressive costume from one of two classic dynasties, whereupon you will be seated and photographed (with your own camera) aplenty. Step 3: Wear the costume for the remainder of your visit, wandering clockwise around the gardens, taking the side-paths were available, while discovering the myriad delights. Be sure to get some other tourists to take your selfies for you!Step 4: Return your costume, tip generously, and think about how wonderful it is to find such a treat in the midst of this bustling city."

It is totally worth the $6 entry as the plants themselves would be quite expensive and you can see it is well maintained. The staff are really lovely and help you take photos (bring a good camera).

Of all the tourist attractions we visited while in Sydney, the Chinese Garden of Friendship was truly one of the most memorable and enjoyable stops. The entry price was too good for the peaceful ambience and beautiful up-keeping required. While the Garden looks small on the map, it is quite big inside. We easily spent 2+ hours walking through the trailwalk and checking out the ponds. Before exiting, we bought some tea and buns from the cafe. It was one of the best and \"authentic\" buns I've ever had. The staff was very lovely too. Quite simply, we had the best of times at the Garden, and will definitely visit over and over again everytime we're in Sydney."

            "review": "Not to be missed. This garden is an excellent point of reference for the mix that is Sydney and if you're a gardener, not to be missed. Built for the 1988 Bicentennial, it was a gift by businessman of Chinese background to their fellow citizens, a wonderful gesture. Much of the work was carried out by craftsmen from China. Being in the heart of a huge city, you'd expect noise and chaos. However, this is a place of beauty and peace. It doesn't take all that long to walk around the lake and garden but it would be to miss the point if that's all you do. There are many places to sit, observe and think. The garden has been built with all the traditions of Chinese landscaping present. The seas, mountains, rivers, islands are all there as well as a picturesque cascade. Most of the traditional plants have been included and I assume those missing are only because of climate restrictions. The lake is, as usual, the centre piece and it has been beautifully constructed and surrounded by many traditional built features; dragon wall, moongate, pavilions, bridges and the zig-zag bridge necessary to stop evil spirits. There are many koi, some are particularly beautiful. The stand of black bamboo is spectacular. There is a fine display of penjing (bonsai) as well as a cafe. Admission price is really quite reasonable. Before or after, its a quick walk to the rest of the Chinese section of Sydney with its many restaurants. To me, this place gives meaning to the old Chinese saying, \"If you want to be happy for an hour, get drunk; if you want to be happy for a month, get married; If you want to be happy forever, build a garden.\""

The Chinese Garden of Friendship was within walking distance of our hotel, so we decided to check it out. What a pleasant surprise! It\u2019s hard to believe that there is such a quiet and serene setting in one of the world\u2019s busiest cities.

I came across the gardens early hours of the morning however they were shut. They are open after 9am as are most places in Sydney. The opening hours aren't clearly sign posted for those not familiar to the area. Don't try the doors they are alarmed, a slight knock can set them off as my child unfortunately tried to open the doors thinking they were just closed, whoops. What a fright. All was well, we returned after 9am and the price for entry was surprisingly low. Made it cost effective and didn't burn a hole in my purse.If you have a family they do family rates dependent on the size and structure of your family. They even have a tea house, which again I wasn't aware of where you can sit down and enjoy the gardens whilst being refreshed. The gardens are well set out and are beautiful, for those with children, they have some large fish for little eyes to feast upon. There is information about the plants and gardens background together with a wishing well located inside. Its not very wheelchair friendly in the higher rocky parts of the garden but can be enjoyed from ground level just the same.I found it took about 1-1.5 hours to properly have a look around and take in the beautiful scenery that was hidden in amongst the concrete buildings. Prices at the cafe were very reasonable so it makes it affordable and a pleasurable experience if you are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and zone out.Hope this helps."

The scenery is nice, but the peaceful feeling of a Chinese Garden is difficult to convey in this location when you are surrounded by tall buildings and, at the time of our visit, assaulted by the constant noise of nearby construction.

Just looking at the Lake of Brightness and the vegetation around calms you down. I strongly recommend to sit down at some point and just embrace the atmosphere. This is a very generous gift by the Chinese sister city Guangzhou of Guangdong Province to Sydney and New South Wales.The leaflet provides you with information about all points of interest and some detailed stuff about highlights. They also offer a guided highlights tour through the garden. During the walk you can learn things about Chinese culture and the friendship between Sydney and Guangzhou - meaning there is more to discover than the beauty of the garden.Don't forget to try on the royal costumes for an extra fee. It is an awesome experience and definitely something to remember, no matter if you are coming as a couple or as a family. This place is also perfect for people who don't have much time.

This was my 3rd port of call for today and I enjoyed every minute of it, from watching the red and silver koi carp in the pool to wandering the paths and sitting with a brown and gold lizard the length of my forearm.In fact, there were many lizards of diverse colours and various sizes, from the size of my little finger to the giant mentioned earlier. The most attractive colour were the dark brown with a line of golden spots down each side - what a fabulous colour combination. The sun was glinting off the golden spots; the lizards were quite active running hither and thither through the ferns at the water's edge, or just lazily sunning themselves on a warm rock.Later, a family came through who had opted to take advantage of the opportunity to dress up in Japanese Kimonos, complete with obis and in one case, a sword. They made a very colourful sight among the masses of cool greens of the gardens. This is a lovely oasis of calm in the middle of a very busy city, and well worth the visit. There's a caf\u00e9 should you want refreshments. The entrance fee is quite small (can't remember exactly how much) and there is limited wheel chair access but still enough to enjoy the surroundings."

Inside it is so lovely, the Chinese have a way of blending plants and water together to bring out some very pretty vistas and a sense of tranquility.I should say that this is not a suitable place for people with walking difficulties or for wheel chairs and push chairs.It is a place to stroll around to sit and contemplate, to take loads of photographs and to forget the outside world for a couple of hours.At one point inside you come across a small building where you can go in and get dressed up in the most colourful Chinese outfits and walk around to find that special spot for a photograph.There was a wedding taking place when we arrived, lovely setting for such an occasion.There is also a lovely area for refreshments, anything from tea and coffees to cold drinks, snacks and cakes etc.This a certainly a place that is well worth taking a couple of hours out of your day to visit, recommended."

It is both serene and surprising at the same time and offers many places where you can sit and meditate or just breathe in the tranquility. Experts from China and Australia worked together to produce this amazing combination of plants and trees, ponds and streams, rocks and pavilions, walls and gates and statues. I visited in autumn when about half the flowers had gone, but there was still enough plenty of colour, but I was assured that the summer blooms are even more stunning. The numerous pavilions and gates offer eye-catching but varied views from every angle. Exotic waterfowl share the pools and waterfalls and stroll among the bamboo and peonies or go through elaborate mating rituals high in the treetops. Koi and other creatures add splashes of colour to the pools and ponds. I was lucky enough to arrive there on a Sunday morning just as it opened and so for the first hour I had the entire place to myself - as a photographer I was in heaven. If you can only visit one place in Sydney, this is the one I would recommend. Outside the garden's entrance is the Giant Ferris Wheel which offers some great aerial views of the gardens also."

I love Asian-themed gardens to enjoyed this a lot but it isn't for everyone. You need to like this style to thoroughly justify the cost to get in. We were 3 adults with 4 kids total so it was $34.It's fun for kids because you can rent traditional Chinese clothing here and get pictures taken among many Chinese artistic features and temples throughout the park.We were lucky to be there when a lot is in bloom and beautiful Asian-style water features are everywhere. There is a nice cafe in the park to have afternoon tea. It's a cool contrast to see the water, rocks, birds, carp, lizards and plants of this natural Zen garden surrounded by the skyscrapers and office high-rise buildings of Sydney.If once you leave here if you still seek the Chinese experience, China Town is not even a 10 minute walk away and worth a walking tour (and unlike here it's free). If you aren't into Chinese-themed gardens but like plants I definitely recommend you visit the Botanic Gardens rather than here."

Unfortunately on my recent visit the weather was in a rainy mood so lingering without an umbrella was unwise, however the weather actually added to the serenity. Street noise is muted.Given the proximity to Chinatown's main restaurant area, about a five minute walk away,a visit to the Garden is a must if you are in the area. Entry costs $6.00 for an adult with lesser prices for Pensioners, Concession holders and children. My entrance fee was $3.00. A bargain! If you feel like lingering longer, The Teahouse provides a \"range of Chinese tea, dumplings, pastries and steamed buns\". There is also a caf\u00e9 style menu.Unfortunately, this attraction is not \"disabled-friendly\". Most of the Garden pathways are stones, although access to the Tearoom would be possible."

My partner and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and decided to visit Sydney and see some of the sights around Darling Harbour and the Rocks. Our hotel was situated near china town and was only a short walk away from the Chinese Garden of Friendship. We walked straight past it and it looked wonderful. We went inside payed the entrance fee. If you are a student be sure to bring your student card as they offer discounts (we only ended up paying $6 for the two of us). The garden offers guided tours two times a day, but the garden is just as good if you walk it at your own pace. There are lots of photo opportunities as the garden is full of lovely flowers, trees, Chinese architecture and water features. The garden also offers traditional Chinese costumes to hire and professional photography if you want to dress up - it looked quite fun! The garden is a cheap but lovely place to spend a few hours relaxing!"

The entrance fee of $ 6 per person is well worth it as it includes a guided tour twice a day. Once you get in you can spend the whole day inside the gardens and looking around at your own pace. Really enjoyed the informative and friendly guided tour as well. Don't forget your camera.!! The only complaint I have is the greenery and water attract a lot of mosquitoes and if you stay still long enough you get bitten."

I last visited this beautiful garden several years ago but recently directed our overseas visitors to this peaceful oasis in the city, in December 2013.It is amazing to find this oasis right in the middle of the city and now I know why it is called the 'secret garden'. You can stroll through the gardens at your own place and then sit and take it all in. I could have stayed here for hours in the cool if not for the fact that there was lots of other things to fit into my day on my short visit to Sydney. If you are planning to visit this place then you should allow a few hours so that you can also have tea. If I had known previously about these amazing gardens I would have allowed more time. The entry fee is cheap if you are on a budget. This will definitely be one of the very first 'must do' things on my list when I next visit Sydney. It is only a short stroll from Darling Harbour."

Despite a limited selection on offer, the sandwiches were fresh and delicious and the cakes superb. The tea was loose leaf in a tea pot and the coffee was also very good. Sitting in a pavilion on the edge of a lake we were able to watch the carp chasing each other around, ducks waddled past our table and into the water and a beautiful water dragon nibbled crumbs from under the table. We spent a couple of hours just soaking up the peace. What a wonderful lunchtime refuge from the bustling city."

I went early in the morning and there were very few people there .Even when the people started to build up there was still peacefulness and serenity. The gardens are immaculate.The waterfallsare beautiful and all this in the middle of Sydney's high rise buildings.The gardens are kept in immaculate condition and the trees,plants and bonsai all in very good health.There are a large number of coor fish which have a beautiful and peaceful home to swim around in. I will visit this again next time in Sydney as cheap entry fee as well as a relaxing place in amongst the hustle and bustle of Sydney. Loved it."

The garden has been designed to appear larger in the inside than it actually is and there are lots of little hidden annexes and corners all designed with Chinese symbols and history in mind. Great for taking interesting photos, and I highly recommend spending a bit extra and opting for the afternoon tea package (tea and scones, or green tea and dumplings - yum!!)"

A huge amount of planning and artistry must have gone into creating and maintaining this garden and it shows. Everywhere you look is a different but spectacular view, it's almost too good to be true. You don't have to be a garden lover or even interested in Chinese culture to appreciate the dazzling natural beauty of this place.It's easy to get to - wedged between Darling Harbour and Chinatown. If you are staying anywhere in the CBD you can probably easily walk there. It's only $6 entry for adults and there are deals where you can have lunch and drinks included in the entry price (though I haven't tried the food). For this visit, the costume shop was open and I was able to pay $10 extra and be dressed as a 15th century Chinese princess!! You are expertly dressed by people who are obviously passionate about their job and their culture, they then use your camera to take photos of you (don't worry, they tell you how to pose), then they send you out into the garden, in costume, to take more photos for yourself! You can stay in the costume for as long as you want. There are costumes for men and women of all sizes, the women's costumes were gorgeous and the men's looked so cool!! I truly felt like a princess flouncing around the lovely garden in my pretty outfit. Opening times for the costume shop aren't on their website but I'm pretty sure it was from 1pm onwards most days. Koi feeding daily at 11:30am - they are the fattest, biggest koi I have ever seen! Not wheelchair friendly at all.You're a fool if you skip this garden on any visit to Sydney.

A portion of the garden is not blocked off by the tall white Chinese walls so you can see what the garden inside looks like. I and my mom walked to the entrance where we paid our 6 dollar entrance fee each to get in. I had thought that the 6 dollars entry price was fairly expensive for a garden, especially when you are a visitor from Africa, and 6 dollars can get you so much more in Africa. Then again, this is Sydney and it is the 3rd most expensive city in the world. The garden is 100% well maintained and is everything you would expect of a chinese garden. It was pristine and the garden flowed so well, probably because of feng shui principles incorporated into the garden when it was first designed.Enter into the garden and instantly you will be guided by the footpaths to various shelters spots, waterfalls and temples. The paths are well designed with rocks, bamboos growing on the sides, and the reasons for the placements of various objects are well explained on boards placed around the garden. Be ware of swooning birds - they have them in the garden according to the signage, although we were never affected by them.I and my mom took photos everywhere we went. It was just stunning. Before you know it, our garden walk was over and we had reached the exit. The garden is fairly small - similar to all the attractions in Sydney - and therefore it might not have given me as much value for money as I had thought (remember, I'm from Africa and I'm more use to money going further). If you are on a tight budget, I would suggest giving this garden a miss - the reason you are in Sydney is to experience Australia and I think your 6 dollars would be better spent on going to a pub, such as the O Bar at Australian Square where you could see the whole of Sydney."

My wife said wait, wait till she puts the cell phone away. Also, some guy, a visitor, was doing a combination of Tai Chi and karate near a pagoda. We thought he must have been inspired by the atmosphere and scenery of this attraction. Still not any worse than characters Los Angeles. The Chinese Garden is worth the time and there is very minimum admission fee."

This garden was a gift from the city of Guangzhou in southern Chin to the city of Sydney to mark the 1988 Bicentenary. It is located in Darling Harbour. I decided to visit one afternoon and was not disappointed. If you want to relax , be still, sit and think, or just listen, this is the place to go. There are lots of rocks, plants, trees, water and a small hill with an impressive waterfall, representing the landscape of southern China. There are lots of winding stone pathways and benches to sit. There are many pavilions and sculptures etc. if your would like to dress up in imperial costumes there is a little shop where you can hire silk gowns and pretend you are an Emperor, a princess or a Chinese warrior! If that makes you thirsty , there is a nice tea house also. There is a small admission fee-- 6 Australian dollars when I visited-- well worth this. Highly recommended."

I was lucky enough to be there on a Sunday morning just as it opened for business and for the first hour I had the place to myself! Such peace , tranquility and beauty to enjoy without being disturbed! Whether you are a fan of Chinese culture, architecture, horticulture or just a lover of beauty this is the place to visit. The vistas are breathtaking from every angle - pavilions, pagodas, gateways, trees, plants, pools, rock gardens - this place has it all. Black necked storks thrive here and add to the glory of the environment. Even in winter, colourful flowers abound. There is a serenity here that cannot be found in too many other places."

It's very tranquil and beautiful. It only costs $6 entrance which for what you get is an absolute bargain! There's a little restaurant that you can get dumplings and tea, which unfortunately I never tried but it looked really good.

We had visited the gardens on an earlier visit to Sydney and just had to go again as it was somewhere that had stuck in my mind as being so beautiful. We spent over an hour wandering around the various paths leading to one beautiful vantage point after another. Clicking away, it wasn't long before I'd taken around 50 photos. The water is full of beautiful carp and we were also lucky to see a bearded dragon and turtles. The gardens are immaculately cared for and there's a couple of beautiful waterfalls which block out the sounds of the city. There are bench type seats in lots of places so you can sit and take in the whole experience.We went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't busy at all and for the price of entry, it's got to be one of the best value attractions around at $6 each. There was a wedding booked for the day we went but that didn't make too much difference to our experience and we were lucky enough to see the bridal party arrive just as we were leaving. I can't imagine a more perfect place for wedding photos. I would highly recommend a visit to the Gardens when visiting Sydney - you won't regret it."

In March, 2013, my wife and I visited the Garden of Frfiendship located at Darling Harbour in Sydney, Australia.We almost did not get around to it, but went with a couple of days to go in our vacation. We were delighted we included a visit to this oasis of peace in the frenetic world of the city.The entrance fee was a mere $6.00 each and once in there it seemed like a magestic fairyland of beauty, grace and peace. We spent about 90 minutes there and took probably about 75 photos. It was awesome, clearly one of the best things we did on our 23-day trip to Australia. I highly recommend it ... very highly indeed.Part of the way through this marvelous experience, I realized some of the tension I carry with me had left. It felt so good. My disabled wife and I felt much better. It was uplifting in ways I cannot adequately put into words. You really need to experience this \"oasis of peace.\" I highly recommend it. Set aside an hour at a minimum while in Darling Harbour and visit this place. You will feel better in my opinion."

Easy to get to by Monorail or City rail and walking distance from other Darling Harbour attractions like the Paddy's Markets, Tumbalong Park, Madam Tussauds etc. We had a lovely time in the Chinese Garden of Friendship. There were 3 entry options. Basic entry is $6 per person. If you want entry and tea and scones in the Tea Garden then best to buy the $11 entry ticket. Then I think there was a $17 ticket which included entry to the gaden and sandwiches and a drink. We paid $6 for my husband to enter and I paid $11 to have the tea and scones. We decided to go to the Tea house first and take in the view of the garden from there over a cup of tea and the scones. The pot of tea was large enough to make 3 cups of tea - so we shared a cuppa with no probs. The scones although lovely and served with jam and cream were on the small side and not the traditional scones we're used to. Nonetheless there were 2 on the plate and enough for us to share. Near the cafe there's a room with a carriage made of jade - the history is astounding - 300t of jade were cut to make the carriage and the finished product only weights 2 tonne. We then enjoyed the journey through the gardens meandering through the different rooms and along the many pathways. This is a magic place to spend a few hours (perhaps reading a good book or sketching while here would be nice too) and best enjoyed when you don't have to rush through it. Access for people with limited mobility could be awkward. Be prepared to see birds, bearded dragons and skinks along the way. The sound of the water cascading over carefully placed rock formations was soothing. There are several pavillions where you can sit and just take in the surroundings. There are so many wonderful photo vantage points. Fish and turtles were seen in the ponds. Weeping willows, jasine, bamboo and frangipani were abundant. Costumes could be hired for $10. We saw 2 lovely girls hire costumes and walk through the gardens and have some fun taking photos."

You can have scones and tea, or dim sum in the garden, which unfortunately we were too late for, but the benefit to visiting the garden late in the day was that there were not many people there, and after being given the '5 minutes til closing' warning the whole garden emptied and we were able to get our best photos!

The gardens attract birds, and the lake is filled with some of the most fascinating carp I have ever seen. Indeed, as we sat in the cafe I swear they were playing with each other, and with the ducks that seemed unbothered by having fish nip at their feet.

It has quite a few different sections and miniature versions of what I suppose you'd see in a real Chinese garden, complete with explanations. There was a couple just lounging under one of the trees, which I found odd for a tourist attraction, but guess that's what some people do. Another couple was taking wedding pics through out with their photographer and entourage. Excellent idea.I, on the other hand, loved going up and down the various walk-ways and mini-hills. The garden has clearly been built with much TLC and they maintain it quite well. I enjoyed all the water features and mini water-falls. The best thing about the garden is that it is in stark contrast to the rest of the overly commercial elements in Darling Harbour."

Last weekend, we went to visit a hidden treasure of Sydney, in the middle of the city in Darling Harbour.Initiated by the local Chinese community to share their rich cultural heritage and celebrate Australia's 1988 Bicentenary, the Chinese Garden is the result of a close bond of friendship and cooperation between the sister cities of Sydney and Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, China. The Chinese Garden of Friendship was designed by Sydney's Chinese sister city, Guangzhou.Even though I have been living in Australia for so long I have never been inside the Chinese garden. I have walked past the garden numerous times but for some reason never thought to go inside. Last weekend the weather was so good that I and my husband decided that we must go out and enjoy the sunny day. So we took a train to the city and walked to Darling Harbour from Town Hall train station.We were in the garden by 11am and there were only 3 people on the queue to get tickets to go inside. We got the ticket and it cost us just $6.00. We started our tour from the right hand side door of the garden.The whole garden cannot be seen from any one point within the garden. It has a number of features including the Dragon Wall symbolizing the bond between New South Wales and Guangzhou, the Water Pavilion of Lotus Fragrance, the Twin Pavilion and The Tea House that offers traditional Chinese tea and other refreshments. The garden is a popular venue for weddings, providing many beautiful backgrounds for photographs.We were there to enjoy the day so we just walked around the garden and enjoyed the sun taking photos from time to time. There was a big pond in the middle of the garden and it had big colourful fishes. I actually forgot that we were in the middle of the city once we were inside. As spring has started here, there were so my beautiful flowers in the garden. I just loved everything in it: the trees, well-trimmed plants, beautiful spring flowers, calm lotus pond and the magnificent temple.It was peaceful, serene, beautiful and calming. There is a waterfall which gives the feeling that you are in some national park. There are some alcoves to rest and overlook the whole garden to just soak in its natural beauty. We took so many photos as wherever I turned there was a beautiful view. The garden isn't large but there are plenty of places to sit and take in the views. It took us about an hour to meander through the garden.We saw a beautiful bridal carriage which is the imperial bridal carriage was used by Chinese Emperors in ancient times with extremely ornamental decorations. The jade carriage is typical of the historical carriages of past dynasties. It is believed 100 skilful artists were engaged in the laborious and intricate carving work. Over 300 tons of raw jade were used, the finished weight approx. 2 tons.The carriage has a canopy decorated with entwining dragon motif with two lanterns in front. The main body of the carriage is carved into elaborate openwork of dragon, phoenix and fairies which are the symbol of Luck, Prestige and Authority. The two front shafts are cut as two lively charging dragons, guiding the carriage. Behind the carriage are two ornamental fans, which symbolise Royal Dignity.The age and the cost of the carriage are unknown, however it is believed the carriage came from the Chinese Province of Guangdong and it is said to be the only carriage known to be outside China.As we were walking around we saw a few people wearing traditional Chinese costumes and taking photos so we decided to find out more about it. We found a place in one corner of garden where you can hire a costume for $10 and pretend to be a Princess/Queen/Emperor/Empress. They let you roam the garden with the costumes as long as you like and parade around the gardens and take as many photos as you like.So me and my husband decided to dress up as well and become Chinese for a while. I choose a red dress and the lady in the shop helped me to do my hair. AS choose a dark blue one and even got a long white beard to try with his costume. Once we were dressed, the lady from the shop took a few of our photos. From there we walked the whole garden taking photos in different locations. We felt like we were in some movie walking around in the costumes and taking photos. Lots of people stopped to look at us and a few even asked us to pose so they could take a photo of us . It was a really interesting experience to feel like we were in China. If you feel hungry there is a teahouse. You can also hire a 45-minute audio tour in English and Mandarin, if you like.For the price, we had an amazing day, relaxing and wonderful."

If it was free, or even just a couple of dollars, we'd probably give it higher reviews because it was really very pretty. But, I just don't know that I see the value given what we paid."

For a small fee, you and your family can dress up in medieval Chinese costumes and pretend you're a Princess/Queen/Emperor, they also let you roam around the garden in the full costume so you can pretend you owned the place like they do in China.

The waterfalls, rocks, yes rocks are fascinating and give the feeling that one is in China. The Koi Carp are beautiful and I understand very valuable.

The Garden was a gift to Australia upon their bicentennial in 1988. It is quite large and features lots of \"bone\" (big rocks, bridges, buildings and earth formations) and \"blood\" (water). There are also many birds, turtles and fish. Oriental gardens are always peaceful and thoughtful places, and this one is quite large and yet extremely private. Highly recommended.

I loved the garden, but think there should be a last entry policy, which allows enough time for you to walk round without rushing."

I first visited the Chinese Garden in about 1997 and fell in love with the startling juxtaposition of its graceful trees and traditional architecture, against the gleaming, modern outline of Sydney. It's a place I still like to visit as it's a quiet corner of greenery where you can relax and recharge away from the busy streets. Paths meander pleasantly through the garden, taking in lovely vantage points and making it seem much larger than it is.I like the garden in all seasons, but, its a garden, so some might find it a bit miserable when the leaves of Chinese deciduous plants have all fallen in winter, and not so much is flowering. Spring and Summer are full of delights.The only downer at the garden is the teahouse - could be an opportunity for a delicious Chinese tea but unfortunately the food, when I've had it, was rather dry and pre-packaged. It's a shame when you know how good Yum Cha could be."

If it wasn't for the high rise buidlings surrounding the gardens you could easily forget you are in the middle of a large city. You can hire emperial costumes to dress up and have your photo taken in the garden. There is also a teahouse at the exit of the garden where you can purchase a drink or snack at reasonable prices. Most of the gardens are accesible with a pram which I had with me. There are steps at the back of the gardens which a pram will not go up, but overall I was able to walk around approximately 3/4 of the gardens pushing the pram (there is always the option of leaving the pram and carrying your child up the steps as well)."

It is quite small but cleverly designed pathways, a 'mountain' to climb and lovely little structures, one could profit well by taking at least half an hour to explore its many features that make it seem larger than it really is."

A wonderful place of tranquility, where we spent several hours wandering the snaking pathways through lovely pagodas, fantastic plants, shrubs and trees, The thought to choice of rocks was fantastic to see so many animals and dragons depicted. The koi in the lake were brilliant, and very nice to see them gather when you clapped at the bridge. The school children visiting were charming, and charmed by the sense of calm. A brilliant place not to be missed, and if you are lucky, you can catch a glimpse of people in Chinese costume! Much better than the 2 minutes to view the Opera house. A stunning place!"

There is a nice pond, and a few nice trees and plants, but nothing that will wow you in any shape or form. If you're running out of things to do after a week or two, it's probably okay to visit, but otherwise, there are plenty of more exciting things to see.

The best part was dressing up in full Chinese ceremonial costumes and having our photo taken. There were 10 in our group who dressed up - it was a hot day and the staff put ice packs on under the clothes, dressed us, took all our cameras and patiently took photos with everyone's camera. The cost was only $10.00 per person and everyone had lots of fun. Would recommend these gardens to everyone visiting Sydney. There is also a tea room in the gardens."

The gardens are lovely and interesting to view. However, they are across the street from an open area that had bands and other activities every time we were near this location. This is very near Darling Harbour and the activities seem to spill over to this area. The gardens are worth a visit but do not expect a peaceful atmosphere."

It was almost like stepping into China.. a nice stroll through the garden also leads to a cafe where you can get little nibblies. We also got some Chinese Tea and sat near the pond watching the carp swim by. It was so relaxing and the scenery was beautiful. Definitely something worth check out"

I was waiting in between appointments and had few hours to spare, so I took my companion to this small, precious garden.It was beautiful and serene. We walked around the garden, read small notes here and there, and spied a Chinese princess in lovely pink dress. When we called her, but she only smiled and walked away. Definitely a immeasurable source of subject for camera enthusiast.If you are a camera-geek, bring a book and seat on any stone bench located in the crooks of the garden and enjoy the warm sun on your shoulder. Beautiful place for a siesta."

This garden is a testament to the principles it is designed upon. I challenge anyone to visit and not walk away calmer and more at peace then when the entered. I would have liked to have taken away some printed matter on the technicalities of the garden design but none was available which was a little disappointing. This is not an attraction children will appreciate. The koi (carp) in the lake were amazing."

This is a lovely place to visit as soon as they open, as one can see all the birds throughout the garden at this time of day. The Walking Tour Leaflet was a great help identifying the plants, as well as Chinese Buildings throughout. The garden is well-planned and one can take several different paths to the areas, sit on benches and admire the plants & birds."

It didn't appear to be well kept. Still, the natural beauty of the plants and buildings were admirable. We took lots of pictures. I was a little bored until, out of nowhere, we find a Jade chariot in a small room. They should tell people where it is. Not only is it incredibly beautiful, but it is rare to see one. I enjoyed reading about the history from the Shang dynasty on the plaque."

It was designed so that there is no point in the garden from where you can see the entire garden. There is always something around the next corner, up the next staircase, something hidden down a little footpath that is worth a look! It rained the day we went, which I thought would have ruined it, but it made it even more beautiful, especially when the sun came out and was glistening off all the water! My boyfriend and I huddled under our umbrella or under the lovely pavilions. It was very romantic. They have a little teahouse with decent prices, and you get a free Morning Herald with entry. Beautiful, fun, and well worth the time spent there. Advice, though: take it slow, relax, and take the time to really enjoy it. If you can, sit a while and just relax. Most of the garden is far from outside noise and very peaceful."

They had big rock formations throughout the garden, very tranquil. For $10-15 you could dress up in Chinese clothing and take your own pictures, if I hadn't gone alone that would have been a lot of fun. In the end I sat and drank tea watching the koi fish and birds in the pond. Would highly suggest going, got some beautiful photos also."
