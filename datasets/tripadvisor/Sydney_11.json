            "review": "Excellent way for happy medium to view Sydney from the bridge. This option for the bridge is $20 as opposed to $300+ - we were advised the price was going up for the actual climb. You do have a trek to the top of the lookout and so I would not suggest it for the young, meek, elderly. I am none of those and I found myself grateful when we arrived at the gift shop - which was a hair away from being at the top but I needed the break from the step climb. I can only imagine on a clear day how phenomenal this would have been - but it still was just a really nice way to look out over the city of Sydney and then walk some portion of the bridge after that. You can walk all around the lookout so you do get a 360 degree view. Highly recommend."

There is a little museum that has displays regarding the history of the bridge, a small shop where you can purchase drinks, souvenirs etc. The view is great as you can walk all around the top of the pylon and take your camera as well. Cost is very reasonable and you can stay as long as you like."

I have done the bridgeclimb, the pylon lookout and just walked across the bridge. $13 gives you a half decent view, but I didn't think it was much better than walking across and could not compare it to actually climbing the bridge at all. If anything, I thought getting to the pylon lookout was harder going than climbing the bridge!In my opinion, just walking across the bridge is just fine and free. Take a train to Milsons Point and then walk back over bridge to the rocks/Circular Quay."

            "review": "Awesome view! A better alternative than doing the bridge climb, unless.... This is the pylon lookout, as opposed to the bridge climb. We investigated doing the bridge climb, but it wasn't worth it for us.The Pylon Lookout - the walk over the bridge provides a fantastic view even if you don't do the pylon lookout or bridge climb. However, the pylon lookout does get you higher, with some unobstructed views of the Opera House and that side of the harbor. It's a great view, a good hike, and doesn't take too much time out of your day. Definitely worth it.The Bridge Climb - we chose not to do this due to the cost and, most importantly, because they do not let you take a camera up with you. Although I understand that they do not want you to drop anything on the cars below, such a restriction kind of defeats one of the main goals of getting that high above the harbor. They also make you wear a jumpsuit, so, sneaking a camera probably isn't easy (nor am I suggesting you should try). The novelty for the bridge climb is the height and open feel of being on the bridge. We are rock climbers and felt that the height novelty wouldn't really justify the cost, which is prohibitive. If you want the rush of being high up, my suggestion is to do one of the great hikes in the Blue Mountains that is exposed and do the Pylon Lookout in Sydney for the harbor view. You'll save time, money, and probably get an overall better Sydney area experience. That being said, if the bridge climb is something you really think you'd enjoy, then you probably will - try not to think about the cost and have a great time!"

I have been in good and bad weather, and it wasn't a let down even in the rain! The museum is part of the fee to get in for the lookout, and I highly recommend giving yourself at least 30-45 minutes if you're at all interested in history. A fascinating look at the building of the bridge. I'll probably return on each visit to Sydney."

The main attraction is the lookout with a fantastic view to the opera house and the city, which is almost as high as you get with the bridgeclimb. So it is a great much cheaper alternative which also takes less time."

I never knew about this pylon lookout until a friend recommended it, but with the bridge walk being way out of our price range this was a great budget option. I showed my student card and got in as a concession meaning it cost me under $10. It took us under two hours to go around the museum and take in the spectacular view at the top, but I suppose it could take longer or shorter depending how long you want to spend reading information etc. But there is no rush you just make your own way to the various levels in your own time. I never realised I knew so little about Sydney harbour bridge, so I would recommend this activity as I learnt so many interesting facts. It was such a clear day when we went up and good to watch the world go by below."

We almost didn't bother but glad we did as the views are impressive with an alternative view down onto the Opera House, harbour and the bridge itself from what we had experienced before. It certainly wasn't a wasted trip in our view and i would say that if you are traveling on a budget then this is a 'must do' to get a great view of Sydney's icon architecture, even if you dont go up the pylon the walk up from Cumberland St in The Rocks and across the bridge walkway is exhilarating. Views are equally impressive and cost you nothing!"

To my disappointment, you can eliminate this especially if you have the Harbour Ferry in your itinerary. The view that you are seeing is just the same Sydney Opera House. The view from the Ferry have better glimpse and even more relaxing. Beware..... Walking up the Pylon Lookout is not recommended for elderly. I don't suggest this tourist spot as it waste your time seeing the same scenery on just a different angle."

After that I found out about the Pylon Lookout, and I have to say, I'm not even interested in climbing the bridge anymore.The lookout is located in one of the towers of the Harbour Bridge, the one that's closer to The Rocks, and you can access it from the walking path of the bridge. Tickets are not expensive. You just need to climb a couple of steps and you make it to the top. The view from there is breathtaking, you can see the Opera House, Circular Quay, the CBD, Barangaroo, North Sydney...and all around the Harbour (like a 360\u00ba experience); you're so close to the bridge that you feel like you could touch it. It's definitely a Must-see in Sydney!"

First from the main harbor area walk along Cahill expressway towards the rocks (an area of Sydney). Turn right on George Street. Turn left on Argyle street and walk up the hill. Just before the big underpass turn right on Argyle steps (sign on wall above entry). At the top go out towards the road (Cumberland). Go across and a little left to bridge steps. Go to the top and you will find the pedestrian pathway going across the bridge. The pylon climb is in the first pylon you come to. Fantastic views of Sydney harbor and Opera house. Costs $13.

The walk offers spectacular views over the harbour, bridge and Opera House and there's seating and a history panel along the way. About halfway along the walk, the Pylon Lookout has a small museum and theatrette on one level, a souvenir shop and display of historic souvenirs further up and a walk-around parapet at the top. At $13 ($8.50 for seniors), it's a good alternative to BridgeClimb with plenty of dining options in Kirribilli at the end.

When visiting Sydney as a toursit me and my boyfriend were tight on money and had heard mixed reviews about the Bridge climb so decided to do the pylon lookout which was a no brainer at $13! The walk up is quite tiring so bare this is mind but we found this trip soo interesting, make sure you read all the history and dont just walk passed it (it is very interesting) The view from the lookout is so good you are way higher up than you expect and can see everything just as much as if you did the bridge climb I am told. We did this on a very overcast day and think it would be even better on a sunny day, The film at the end is also worth staying for. Highly recommend! We stayed for at least an hour."

There are bench- height places to stand and walk along so you can get a great view no matter your height. For $13 and a moderate stair climb which is all internal, you can take your time to appreciate the view and stay as long as you like. My BF did the bridge climb, then met me here and we did the Pylon, he enjoyed both. Hardest part was finding the way to get there, Google is not accurate. The approach to the Pylon is far back at Argyle Steps - close to Argyle / Cumberland intersection. When you're close, there are signs. Then cross Cumberland (I think) and slightly left and go up another set of stairs which takes you to the bridge level. Give yourself time to find and walk there, it's further than it appears. Well worth the effort!"

The exhibit on the construction of the bridge is a nice added bonus as well! Could do with friendlier staff though.

I particularly enjoyed reading about the social aspects and the impact of the Bridge on Sydney. Reaching the Lookout requires climbing 200 steps, but this should be manageable for most and there are places to stop and rest if necessary. The views from the top are breathtaking. We were blessed with sunny weather and the views over the Harbour, Opera House, Circular Quay, the CBD and North and West Sydney were very nearly as spectacular as those from the top of the Bridge itself. In all we spent an hour climbing, viewing and reading about the bridge and that was time well-spent. At A$13 for entry this is great value for those who don't have the time or the cash to undertake the full Bridge Climb."

I used to go to school in Sydney many years ago and a mate of mine had invited me to climb to the top of the Harbour Bridge on occasions. He had figured a way to get to the top of the arch. The thought of getting caught had always stopped me from joining him. I have kind of regretted it many years later so I was determined to do the \"Walk Over the Harbour Bridge\" tour on my recent return trip in April. I then found out how much it costs. My local friends recommended a great alternative - the Pylon Lookout. For $13 AUS each, my wife and I enjoyed a breathtaking view of the Sydney Harbour, the Opera House and watched a plane sprayed \"Marry Me\" in the sky. (No name was sprayed though so anyone can take credit)The Pylon Lookout also has a museum within that provided a great narrative on the genesis of the Harbour Bridge project. As it turned out the 4 pylons were not structural significant but the Chief Engineer insisted on constructing them as he had the vision that these structures would add major aesthetic to the future icon of this wonderful city.Coming from the Cumberland Street you will have to climb a few set of stairs to get to the east side of the bridge walkway which leads you to the base of the Lookout. Once you reach the Pylon you will have to climb more stairs. But I think it is all very worth while."

I had wanted to do the Bridge Climb since some friends had completed it but hadn't realized how expensive it was - especially if you want to go at a popular time -- upwards to $300. A colleague mentioned doing the Pylon lookout -- as the view was almost as good, took much less time, you could take all the pictures you want (you can't take your own camera on the Bridge Climb) and it was only $13. We went on a beautiful day and it was breathtaking! So worth the trip! You have to go up about 200 steps but it was not very difficult -- there were breaks/etc. every 60 steps or so."

If you don't do the Bridge Climb on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but want to get pretty much the same views as those who do the Climb, head for the lesser known Lookout at the first pylon on the Bridge. It's not that easy to find the pathway to the pylon, but well worth the effort. For around $10, you get to climb about 200 steps to the observation deck, about 285' above the water, for 360\u00ba views of the Sydney Harbor and the city skyline. From the pylon you can even watch the climbers as they make their way to the top of the Bridge arch. On the way up to the observation deck, there are 3 levels of exhibits where you will discover the history and construction of the Bridge. Definitely worth a visit."

We decided to walk across the bridge on a stunning autumn day and we found the pylon museum, which I had only heard of a day or so before ( despite being a regular visitor to Sydney and one time resident).Cost from memory was $13 for adults, $8.50 for teenagers and $6.50 for kids, kids under four for free.200 stairs to the top, so some reasonable fitness is needed.The Views are just breathtaking, 360degrees with clever faint writing on the glass, pointing out landmarks.The museum was informative. We all enjoyed it! It is easy to find, just walk over the bridge and it is on the walkway."

Climb the pylon think it's $15 you get an awesome view but you don't go as high as the bridge climbers. The bridge climbs were fully booked so book in advance. The days are hot so plan well. If your not great with heights just do the pylon for a fraction of the price."

That said, the pylon wasn't too bad!It is easily accessible after a walk through the Rocks market. Entrance into the pylon also includes some displays and a video about the history about the construction of the bridge. It is comprehensive and informative.For those who wish to have an more affordable way to see the beautiful harbour from above, but don't want to pay for the bridge walk. Definitely visit the Pylon Lookout! You won't be disappointed.Also, the Pylon Lookout is mostly indoors. With the exception of the peak (includes an outdoor area) and the walk up to the Pylon. A total of 200 steps I believe, to reach the peak."

Well over $300 for the opportunity to climb over the bridge seemed very steep (and I don't mean the climb, I mean the price). So I instead walked out on the bridge to the South Pylon and paid $13 to climb up to the lookout point at the top. The view is spectacular, and for the price, a considerable value. There is also bridge information inside the pylon and a short movie reviewing the history of the bridge. The pylon does close in the early evening, so you won't get a chance to see the sunset, or go up at night, but for the cost difference, I thought it was the better value."

They were thinking about doing the Bridge Climb, but were concerned with the price and amount of steps. As a much cheaper option, and more control over the speed you take the stairs, the Pylon Lookout is a very suitable option. The views are nearly as good, and you are able to take your own camera & phone so you can take your own photos, and you decide how long you want to stay.The day we visited was a little overcast and rain was threatening, so seemed like we had made a good choice. The views were great, as usual, with great vistas to the headlands, Circular Quay, Opera House, Darling Harbour, and many other areas.All for the huge cost of AUD $13. We stayed about an hour and watched the film about the construction of the Bridge, read the information & visited the souvenir shop. Our friends from the UK were very impressed and more than happy with the experience.Would highly recommend this for those who have minor mobility issues or are not able to afford the more expensive option of the Bridge Climb."

For an inexpensive and magnificent 360 degree view of Sydney CBD, harbour and surrounds as well as a history lesson on the Bridge ... go to the Sydney Harbour Bridge Pylon Lookout and Museum. Watch the ferries, yachts, boats, ships and water taxis on the harbour; the cars, trucks, buses and trains on the bridge; and helicopters, seaplanes and jets in the air .... without feeling rushed or being pushed on by a tour operator. Tips: - there's about 15 flights of stairs (about 200 steps) to the top so take care - it's not recommended for frail people or very young children- there are several stops on the way up where you can catch your breath- there aren't any elevators or escalators- the payment desk is after about 10 flights of stairs- there are toilets in the gift shop area, which is the next floor up from the payment desk- you can take cameras out on the outdoor observation deck- there are no coin-operated binoculars on the observation deck so if you want a really good view, bring your own binoculars- the video presentation in the museum is on loop and goes for about 5-6 minutes and is highly recommended- the museum exhibits and information are fascinating and are highly recommended- go early to avoid school groups - but regardless, it didn't seem to get that busy- give yourself at least an hour and a half to absorb the views and take in all of the museum exhibits- no need to book in advance- we went on a sunny day but I'd say that rain, hail, thunder or shine, the view would be absolutely magnificent"

My husband did the Bridge Climb and after leaving him at the Bridge starting point, I went a short walk partly over the Bridge and then went up the Pylon Lookout. The 180 degree views of the harbour were great and I got some good photos. I had intended just waiting to see if I could spot him start his climb (it's about an hour before they appear on the Bridge) and then meet him back at base when he'd finished. However I was amazed how easy it was to spot him and follow his progress. There were several others on the lookout doing the same as me and watching people they knew doing the climb. In fact there was quite a comradely between us and I ended watching him climb up and come back down, and the time flew by. Add to that I managed to get the most amazing pictures of him and met some interesting fellow holiday makers."

The Bridge was built around the time of the Great Depression but it is a great example of vision and co-operation. Its design was simple but extremely elegant. There are some stairs just off Cumberland Street (up from the Shangri-La hotel with its 36th level views of the Bridge - worth paying $8 for a small mineral water for). Now the adventurous can pay for a Bridge Climb guided tour but we more timid souls just need to walk 64 steps of a brick pylon and we are a the podium level. A short walk on a concrete path through some lovely trees takes up to the steel part of the bridge and then a few more steps to the look-out in one of the main four pylons of the bridge. The view of the water is great and the Opera House is right in front. You can't see the heads (but the Manly Ferry will do that for you) or the vista of Sydney from \"on high\" but you are at the same level as the top of a good sized cruise ship. It's all free to this point and you can keep walking across to Milson's Point or do as we did and meander back through the rocks area to Wynyard Station and take the train to Milson's Point and back again for views of the west side of the Harbour."

Just fantastic, especially on a sunny day! There is no time limit to how long you can stay and admire the view either. Be sure to look in the gift shop on the way up or down as some of the merchandise is very reasonably priced. I found a T-shirt for only AUD$9.95 so bought two in different colours! The staff are helpful and friendly too. A \"must do\" whilst in Sydney and suitable for all ages and fitness levels."

Climbing the Pylon Lookout is a perfect alternative to the larger expense, or also if you have less time for this activity. Granted, it does not have the 360 degree views, and does not go as high .. 87 m instead of the bridge's 134 m. However, it is still higher than the Opera House at 67 m and gives you an amazing view of the Sydney Harbour and the girder construction of the Bridge itself.The blue granite construction of the 4 pylons is for looks alone, as they do not provide a foundation for the bridge. The granite is supposed to have some special healing power and was brought to the site at one-fourth the cost of the entire bridge.The pylon you climb is the one that is on the south-east corner of the bridge footings. There are several sets of stairs leading to the actual climb area from the Circular Quay. Cost of the climb is $13 per person. the Pylon is open from 10 am to 5 pm. There are several sets of stairs inside the pylon before you get to the admissions area.... by then you are more than one-third of the way up! The climb is advertised as 200 steps, and it probably is in total from street level, but the actual number inside the pylon from the bridge deck level is less than that... I thought about 130.At every stair level (I believe there are six long, wide staircases) there are several displays, and a major historical picture and write-up display of the bridge construction when you get to the admissions area. There you will also find souvenirs and snacks for sale. You can climb as slowly or as quickly as you are able. There are a lot of rest opportunities along the way. The viewing PRIZE is at the top! And what a view it is! You can go right around the pylon that has a narrow walkway with a waist-height wall, and plexi-glass above that. Views of the Opera House, the Bridge, the City and the Harbour are the best. Westward views are still good, obviously not the full view as during the bridge climb... but there is less to see both west and north. And, with this climb, you can take your camera!If you can climb the Pylon, it is a great alternative to the huge expense of the Bridge Climb, and pretty near just as awesome!"

When I got there a light rain stopped me from filming and photography but I've waited it out, in a covered building at the top. Easy.The views are breath-taking! The Opera House, the city, the Bay - just fantastic! You need to remember you're at a top of a high object and there is wind there. Howling, merciless wind, so don't count on any audio recordings if you're shooting a video, and don't wear any loose hats, scarves or any loose wardrobe. It will fly away and you will never see it again. LOLTo get there you may take a few different routes. It's accessible to bikers but not by a car. If you just want to walk there on foot, take the route I chose:Take George street north, to Argyle Street.Turn left (west) at Argyle and watch carefully for an entrance. You will see white apartment building on one side of the street. Take the other side. JUST BEFORE you go under first overpass, look for a small stone arch-way in the wall. It's marked \"Argyle Stairs\", in the stone letters overhead. Take the stairs and follow the signs to the Bridge Pylon. Look it up on Google Street View - you can see it there. On the way back you might stop at The Rocks. It's a small park at the end of the George Street and Hickson Way. More awesome views of the Opera House and the Bridge.  I'm not posting any photos of the Pylon here. There are hundreds of them already available. It's a very interesting spot in Sydney and it won't break your budget."

They had a video of the making of the bridge inside and they did a nice job with the information boards and artifacts they kept to show some of the history of making the bridge. They have a small souvenir shop inside, too.. No small feat, the making of this bridge. Our boys 12 and 15 enjoyed this and preferred not to climb the bridge. They wanted to splurge on going to the Backstage Tour with Breakfast in the Green Rm. at the Opera House instead. So this was a great option for us.

No doubt its a great view and not substantially different to the Bridge climb view, so if you do the bridge climb make it for the experience rather than the view as you get pretty much the same view from here at a fraction of the price.But if we are playing that game do you need to pay $13 to come up here at all? Why not just check the view out from the bridge level walkway for free?That's a fair point and whilst the pylon gives you a bit more elevation that isn't the point of difference to the walkway level. The point of difference is the view of the bridge itself. From the Pylon you get an impressive semi-top down view of the bridge. From the walkway level your view is a freeway crossing the bridge!"

On the way up the pylon inside are many photos and facts about the building of the harbour bridge. The view from the top is 360 degrees breathtaking. We were there for a very long time just taking everything in. On the way out was a short film about the construction which was very interesting. Would recommend to everyone visiting Sydney for the first time."

The view to the Opera House is especially good. The climb to reach the bridge is actually more arduous than the climb up the Pylon which is a series of gentle stairs. The top of the Pylon is about 89 metres above the water. Inside the Pylon there is a small gift shop and there is also a video presentation about the history of the bridge."

But if you just walk on the entrance of the bridge, you will find this Pylon lookout. Reasonable entrance fee and they have a lot of information about the story of how the bridge was built."

The Sydney Habour Bridge has four pylons \u2013 large cement towers atop the foundations for the four main bearings (two at each end) that anchor the bridge; and, one of these, the South East Pylon is accessible to the public and has a lookout atop it. This is a great companion activity, or alternative if time and budget demand, to the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb. The top of the pylon, at 87 meters (285 feet) above the harbor, offers great views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge (up close), the Opera House, the Circular Quay, and the Harbour itself. The entrance fee is modest at AU$13 for people over 13 years in age. It is open every day until 5p. There is a bit of a climb (200 stairs), but exhibits and stops break up the climb if needed. Since the Harbour Bridge Climb does not, for obvious reasons relating to falling objects, permit cameras atop the bridge \u2013 this, then, is the best alternative for taking photographs from a similar vantage point. The views are outstanding. There is only one pylon that is open to public to climb \u2013 again, that is the South East Pylon \u2013 and you can access this from The Rocks area, by taking stairs off Cumberland (which runs alongside and parallel to the bridge) on the southeast side, near Argyle Street. Climb the stairs and then walk towards the span on the sidewalk along the expressway until you encounter the pylon."

For those unwilling to fork out a few hundred dollars for the Bridgeclimb (which is a wonderful experience), or those with a fear of heights, then this is an AMAZING alternative.For around AUD$13.00, you climb one of the historic pylons, and get to the top where you have a 360\u00ba view of Sydney, the harbour, and distant suburbs.You have to be fairly confident with climbing around 10 flights of stairs, but don't worry if you have a fear of heights. The stairs are secure, and inside. And even once outside, the parapet / balcony wall is so high, that you will not have any vertigo or fear. It is IMPOSSIBLE, even standing on the benches to get a better view, to even raise your chest above the solid wall - it's VERY safe and secure. And this is coming from someone who's PETRIFIED of heights!Great photo opportunities abound - especially during fine weather, but it's actually suitable during all weather - except maybe pouring rain.Probably the only thing would be an update to the gift shop (most things are a bit twee / tacky) and perhaps even a small cafe on that level, before heading up to the main viewing level. Hell, someone could make a fair bit of money with evening dining and viewing options!"

This is an excellent alternative to the Bridgeclimb, which although absolutely an amazing experience, can be VERY pricey indeed, and subject to inclement weather. And probably not that suitable for those with a fear of heights.As an alternative, however, the Pylon Lookout offers sensational views over the harbour and the city - from ALL directions, which unimpeded, spectacular views. Be warned that there are QUITE a few flights of stairs to climb, so it's not for everyone, and there's no wheelchair access.But for under $20, you get a look at the history of the bridge, an insight in to how it was built, and once again, SPECTACULAR views. And for those with a fear of heights - don't worry! The outdoor viewing area has a VERY high wall, and protective glass shields. It's almost impossible to even LEAN over the thick wall to look down, and even if you could, it's slightly stepped.Fantastic few hours!"

Our two young children enjoyed the climb up to the viewing area and the view of the Sydney skyline and harbour is undeniably breathtaking. However, equally breathtaking is the intricate latticework of the bridge itself. This iconic structure is majestic and beautiful; the designers, engineers and construction workers did an amazing job. There are some fascinating displays on the different floors and a short film gives an overview of the history of the bridge. We got off the train at Milsons Point and walked across the bridge to get to the pylon - a lovely short walk in itself. A must do when visiting Sydney."

Yes, there are lots of stairs, some 200+ if you are counting, but in my opinion, it's worth it. The views are amazing and the sense of accomplishment is enough to feed that inner glow of warmth.

They don\u2019t do anything for the bridge other than act as sort of bookends to the steel span and thereby give a visual balance. They were a later addition to the design and building of the Bridge.The pylon at the SE corner of the bridge houses the Pylon Lookout. To get there from the Rocks area, there is a staircase from near the junction of Argyle and Cumberland Streets. From the top of this staircase you cross the road and go up a broader staircase to the Bridge walkway. Walk North along this for 400 yards or so to the Pylon: there is no access to the Pylon except on foot.As you ascend the stairs inside the Pylon, there is a lot of interesting material (text, photos, models, film) on the building of the Bridge.From the top (previously used as an anti-aircraft gun platform) you get a great 360 view of the Harbour, Opera House and Bridge.No special equipment required and you don\u2019t have to worry about falling off\u2026"

Climbing a few sets of stairs up inside the Pylon brings you to a secure outside walk around the top of the Pylon itself. The view is 360' as you walk around, looking over the harbour, and it's famous attractions such as the Opera House, and over the city skyline, as well as along the river. Well worth a visit!"

Having done the bridge climb and discovering that you cannot take a camera, for obvious safety reasons, we decided to visit the bridge pylon which houses an exhibition about the building of the bridge and its history. The bridge celebrated its Eightieth birthday a few days after we returned and it was amazing to read the facts about its construction and amazingly how few deaths there were. We could of course take cameras on to the pylon and so although not as high as the bridge itself our lust for high rise photos was sated."

Its a short walk 10-20 mins on the bridge. You can have amazing aerial views of Sydney Opera, CBD buildings and the ferries. No need to do the harbour bridge skywalk ($250), if you are a budget traveller. Just get to the Harbour Bridge for free, make your way to the stairs ask for Pylon Lookout and have amazing views. I did half the bridge, took pics, enjoyed the views and then walked back down the Harbour Bridge."

We looked online and several suggested the Pylon lookout as an option. We decided to try it (@AUD 13.50 per person) and if we did not like it, we would reluctantly spend the AUD 1,000 for the 4 of us. We got there a little early on Sunday morning (they only open at 10). The views were fantastic and we were only about 20% or so lower than the top of the bridge. We had a good view of those climbing up the bridge and decided it was not worth it. We could spend all the time we wanted at the pylon lookout, use our own cameras to take all the pictures we wanted and there was also a very informative film showing the construction of the bridge. Overall a wonderful value!"

I love to zip line and other things but a Bridge climb just wasn't in the schedule given the winds and weather. The Pylon Lookout was a nice replacement for the other. I still had problems with the steps coming down due to cervical spine issue when looking down. At least I didn't freeze up which is what would have happened if I did the bridge climb. I wasn't ready to be rescued and on the news. The Pylon Lookout offers you great views of Sydney so it was very enjoyable. Timing was great as there were not any groups on the Pylon and made it very easy to walk around and take pictures."

Honestly if you dont have much time in Sydney, and your budget is limited, don't worry about doing a Bridge Climb, just do the Pylon Lookout. Costs $13.The walk up is not too bad. Of course if you have knee issues - then perhaps you should give it a miss. But it is a lot easier to climb than some of the other \"climbs\" you will do in other major cities around the world.(arc de triomphe, statue of liberty etc).Def do it!!"

For those who are worried about getting up the stairs, they do provide a few benches at strategic locations up/down the staircase. My only sadness is that I purchased a postcard, paid the fee to get a special cancellation mark from the bridge, but my postcard never made it home to the USA."

So I decided to check out the Pylon Lookout instead, for just $13.50! As you walk up a series of stairs to the top, there is a museum of sorts with plenty of photos and memorabilia showing many aspects of the construction of the amazing Harbour Bridge. It's a wonderful casual journey to the top (unless you're not fond of stairs), however once outside on the top of the Pylon Lookout, you get some incredible views of not only the bridge, but also of the Sydney Opera House, the harbour, and the downtown. You can even see all those that spend the few hundred dollars for the Bridge Climb off to your left, making their way up to the top of the arch of the bridge. They may be just a tad higher than us at the Pylon Lookout, but the views we both receive are out of this world! And the best part, we paid far less."

Also has a little bit of the history of the bridge as well as a gift shop.If you don't have the time or the $ to do the bridge climb this is a great alternative."

I guess if you are either walking across the bridge or over the bridge (Sydney Bridge Climb) then you will definitely be seeing the pylon.But you can actually climb up inside the South East Pylon for more views without the hefty price tag of the Bridge Climb.Is it a must do? Probably not but if you are visiting then yes you might as well while you are here."

But you still need to climb more than100 flights of stairs (i lost count) to go up there. 360D of view from up there."

If you cant climb the Bridge (takes time, some fitness and money) an excellent alternative."

I met my photography group at Milsons Point and then we walked across the bridge to arrive at the Pylon Lookout, on the city side of the bridge. I hadn't been there before but, for a small entrance fee, you can see a museum recalling the development and building of the bridge. There are quite a few steps to climb to get to the lookout but when you get there ... wow! You can walk around the pylon to shoot photos (or just take in the view) of the bridge, the city and the harbour. I was really pleasantly surprised and would recommend a visit."

No thanks!! So I did this instead, it only costs $13 per adult!!! And the views are just as good as the bridge climb although not quite as high up the view is the same really and you can take as many photos as you want for free with your own camera!!

What a bargain seriously the views are almost as good as what the people on the harbour bridge climb would have had, however at a fraction of the cost. Basically you climb up inside one of the pylons on the opera house side of the harbour and there is a lookout on top of the pylon. Another added bonus.........you can take your camera and take as many photos of the magnificent view as you like! With the harbour bridge climb they don't let you take your camera up there and they charge you a small fortune to buy the photos that they take of you!I honestly highly recommend this activity. If you have the money and can justify it then by all means climb the bridge, but this is just as good so much cheaper! A must do when you visit Sydney!"

It was nowhere as costly and we could take many amazing photos from this spot. There is lots to read and learn about in relation to the history of the Bridge and some wonderful old photos to view that show how the bridge was built. You are unable to take photos when doing the Bridge Climb so this also made this option more appealing to me. The Bridge Climb takes a lot longer to do especially given the safety part that must be undertaken. This freed up our day to do more. We then continued walking over the whole bridge on the walkway taking in the stunning view and had fish and chips under the Bridge at the other end. This was a superb day and one I will never forget. A much better and affordable option for a family."

At the top of the tower, the view was breath-taking with a clear view of the Sydney Opera House. You can observe the sydney bridge climbers from the lookout too. After you've spent as much time as you want on the top level, you can make you way down to a small museum and a short film on the construction of the bridge and how the Pylon was a mere decorative monument.

There are quite a few stairs to get to the top so not ideal visiting later in the day after a busy day sightseeing. There is a shop inside the pylon to pick up souvenirs along with displays of the history in Sydney. There is a small fee for this but if you do the bridgeclimb you get a free admission ticket from there for the Pylon. A great place to visit at least once"

You can really see the whole city up here and feel the vibes from the harbour! We looked into doing the bridge climb, but decided to skip it and just do the pylon lookout instead and I'm glad we did. The weather was a touch rainy during our time in Sydney so we were able to do the Pylon Lookout at our convenience when the weather cleared. Great photo ops and fun to read about the history of the bridge. An absolute must do in my opinion!!"

The stairs up were nothing like as many as we were expecting, so if you have any doubts about whether you're physically up to the challenge of the bridge walk, this could be a great alternative. Bring your comera of course, and a windproof jacket if you're here in Winter. Allow a good couple of hours to get the most from the museum and the views."

If you have any small interest in engineering this is a must. If you don't you still can't go wrong. There are great views of the Bridge from the roof of the Pylon and in particular the Opera House.

The museum gives great background history of the bridge and offers more details than our bridge climb guide (or maybe we just got distracted by the awesome views during the climb?).

The south east pylon of the bridge has a lookout which can be reached by climbing 200 steps from the road level of the bridge. On the way up there are 3 levels of exhibits detailing the construction. Admission price is very reasonable and a senior's discount is also available. The lookout is at 87 metres above sea level and provides uninterrupted views of Sydney Opera House and Circular Quay. The pylon can be reached by foot from either The Rocks or the northern end of the bridge. The walk from the northern end of the bridge also gives good views of the harbour. Unfortunately the lookout closes at 5pm, so it is only in mid winter you can see the sunset. It is not open until 10am, so sunrise is not possible."

If catching a train, it may be easier to get off at Circular Quay and walk up that way if you are not interested in walking across the bridge itself. The stairwell at the pylon has a seat at each turn, so if you are unfit or unable to handle the stairs in one attempt, feel free to take a seat.

Spectacular 360 degree views of the harbour and some of the best are looking down the road along the Bridge.Movie introduction to give you a breif histroy of the Bridge and plenty of information for even the most avid history buffs.Good old souvenir shop selling the same old stuff.Give yourselves an hour to fully appreciate the pylon then continue to walk across the Bridge at great way to spend the afternoon."

Once you are on the bridge deck you have to walk a few hundred meters to the pylon entrance. It's not an easy climb if you're out of shape (like I am) but there are several stops along the way so that you learn the history of the bridge. The stops give you a good reason to catch your breath on the way up. And, of course, there is a gift shop near the top that gives you another reason to take a break on the way up.

The museum explains how the bridge was built, why it was built and the politics surrounding it. You then climb some more stairs to a room near the top of the Pylon where you can get some great photos of the city and the harbor. As you leave there is a short movie about the bridge, which has no commentary, but shows some photos of it being built. I went here to learn about the bridge - I had wanted to do a bridge walk, but the money they were asking was outrageous, so I was happy with this as a more reasonable way to learn more about this iconic structure."

There are two exhibition levels on the way up with some good information about the history of the bridge and allows those struggling with the climb a breather. The view from the top was breathtaking. It wasn't busy at all even though it was school holidays so moving around the limited space at the top and taking photos was not a problem.

There is also a lot of very interesting information about the bridge and its history.Needless to say, the views from the top of the pylon are fabulous. I was originally going to do the arch climb but was really glad I chose not to. Apart from it being ridiculously expensive, you have to go at your booked slot and you can be very unlucky with the weather. The pylon option just involves turning up when you fancy it.We thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it."

The walk up the stairs to the overlook location is not as high as we expected so my mother (who is in need of a hip replacement) was able to make it without any problem as long as she took a couple of short breaks on the way up the stairs. The walk to the lookout point also includes interesting information about the bridge and a water fountain, which was appreciated.I recommend that you plan to go early in the morning when it opens at 10am because it is a small overlook point and can be hard to get your desired photos as more people arrive."

If you've seen my review for the bridge climb itself, you'll know that whilst I enjoyed it, for me it is extremely over priced. The Pylon Lookout is a better alternative in my view, on account of the fact that it is cheap to get in to ($15 per person). It is effectively a museum inside and provides a lot of interesting information about the bridge itself. The lookout itself is also at a similar height to the top of the bridge, and you can take your own pictures (something which you cannot do on the bridge climb). All in all I can only highly recommend this, whether you've done the bridge climb or not. TOP TIP: Entry to the Pylon Lookout is free when you do the bridge climb, so it's worth doing even if you have done the climb on account of the fact that you can take your own pictures with the same view."

For those we either can not afford the Sydney Harbour Bridge Walk itself, or maybe do not feel up to it , the Pylon is a great way to get a similar view to the Bridge Walk at a fraction of the cost, around $12 ASD.A great bonus in doing the walk, as in my case, is that you get free tickets for two people to the Pylon Lookout. If you do both then make sure you do the Pylon first as it is a bit of an anti climax, as to be expected, if you do the bridge walk first.There is no lift to the top of the lookout but the steps, around two hundred as east to climb, wide and internal. There are exhibitions and notices to read on the way up to educate you about the Pylon which is granite faced and does not actually hold the bridge up itself.There is a small gift shop at the bottom of the Pylon where you can buy entry tickets and all sorts of souvenirs, The lookout itself is a walkway around the top of the pylon which has a ridge that you can use as a step, good for children, or sit on out of the wind. It provides a full view of Sydney and the surrounds which is great. You can take your camera, unlike the Bridge Walk, so make sure you do as the views are amazing.All in all well worth a visit and for the family a great experience and different way to see stunning Sydney."

It cost $11 to climb up but is a great alternative to those unable to climb the bridge itself. The high glass surounding the lookout makes you feel very safe. I'm terrified of heights but had no problems here at all. It is a bit tricky to find but if you find the bridge walk entrance you'll find the friendly staff happily pointing you in the right direction (about 150m to the left, haha).

Sydney Harbour Bridge Pylon Lookout offers one of the finest 360 degrees views over the city and its magnificent Opera House.It is a Must Do when in Sydney.The 200 stairs that take you to the top of the pylon (87m above sea level) are easily climbed and the reward once at the top is a splendid view of the city and its surrounding.The access to the pylon is located directly on the bridge\u2019s pedestrian walkway and the first flights of steps lead straight to the ticket office.The climb will then take you through various rooms were a lot of memorabilia and photos retrace the construction of the bridge.You will also find mannequins representing workers and maintenance teams who were involved in the construction of the structure.The upper level of the tower has more memorabilia and photos retracing the history of the bridge.The view that you obtain from the top platform is absolutely phenomenal as it directly overlooks the Rocks, and the Opera House on the next bay.It is one of the most beautiful scenes if you happen to be there on a bright sunny day as we were!It is pure beauty!As you climbed down towards the exit you will come across a smaller room located next to the ticket office where original clothes, tools etc\u2026 have been gathered.I guess we could call it a small \u201cmuseum\u201d.It links to another larger room where a huge screen shows every 5mn a film retracing the history of the bridge from its conception, construction and maintenance.The film is very comprehensive and fascinating as we discover the faces of the people who were involved in the project.It also shows the various steps of the construction and we can only admire the feat of engineering along with the drive and passion of all those who proudly participated to the bridge\u2019s erection.The visit costs 10AUD per adult and if I remember well half price for students.The money raise is mainly reused for the maintenance of the bridge as such a beautiful structure needs constant checks.This visit is far less expensive than the climbing of the bridge (about 200AUD and a different type of experience though) and is a perfect alternative for those who want to have a great view of Sydney Harbour without paying a fortune.I would obviously not recommend this climb to people with health issues or physical disability because of the stairs."

Boy did he underestimate haha. I think there were around 230 steps to climb, they kept coming and coming. Finally with legs feeling like jelly, i made it to the top. Yay!He was right. Nthe view is amazing. The cost for the climb was about $11. We took fantastic photos of the harbour and Milsons Point and the Opee House.Can be a bit tricky to find the pylon...I just followed my leader lol.It's a great alternative to the Bridge Climb at a fraction of the cost if it's just the view you are after rather than the climb experience.Be prepares for stiff legs the following day but truly is worth the effort. Recuperate at one of the local pubs around The Rocks afterward with a cool amber to.reward yourself!!!"

I'd recommend the dusk booking as you get to see day and night views and the sunset on a good day. But there's a little known alternative that's much easier and cheaper - The SHB Pylon Lookout, open 7 days 10-5pm. You can take the elevator or the stairs, it includes a museum about the bridge and it costs just $11 (less with concession) to enter! It's in the north-east pylon of the bridge. The four brick pylons of the bridge are decorative only, few visitors know you can get the same view on top of this one pylon as you do on top of the bridge, just maybe half as high. And there's more good news, unlike the Bridge climb, who usually don't let you change the time and date of your climb once ticketed, you can go to the pylon any day it's open and buy your ticket when it suits you. The bridge climb takes about 2 hours to get suited, briefed and do the climb, and it's not great for seniors or kids for obvious reasons, it's expensive, non refundable or changeable even if the weather is the motivation and you can't take anything up there, including cameras so you have to buy the shots they take. The Pylon Lookout is suitable for all ages and visitors so I always suggest the pylon alternative unless you're really hung up on climbing to the top of the span of the bridge."

A visit to the South East Pylon where for a small sum you can climb the to the Pylon Lookout and take in the views around the Harbour as well as an end on view of the Bridge construction. Walk the bridge by the pedestrian path or pay to climb up the bridge is the other alternatives to taking in this great feature, but for me a ride on the Harbour allows you to capture the true beauty of this Sydney feature attraction."

There is an slightly less arduous way of seeing the same view though. One of he pylons at each end has a museum that explains how they built the bridge and at the top of that is a look out platform which gives you the same view of he harbour but slightly lower. That costs 11 dollars which is vastly different. Still worth walking the bridge if you want to though."

Easily accessible from The Rocks or Circular Quay area (tip: access is from the Bridge level, not down below at the very base of the Pylon), after a short climb, about 200 steps you are at about 90m altitude looking out over the bridge and beautiful Sydney harbour (that's like being on the top floor of a 25 story building) - stunning views. Although we were there mid-morning, we had the observation deck virtually to ourselves to enjoy in peace. And admission is great value, and only a fraction of the more expensive commercial walk.After the Pylon Climb you can walk across the bridge enjoying the sights and view, to the rail station on the other side and catch a train back to Circular Quay."

And I am also not overly excited of heights or climbing over bridges. My wife? definitely not a nerd or into these things like me. She is, however, into the thrill of climbing, and adventure. We \"compromised\" (my word, not her's) to do the pylon lookout instead of the bridge climb. Turned out to be a great option for us. It is much cheaper ($11 per person vs a couple hundred), is much quicker (30-60 minute tour vs 4 hrs), and takes you to reasonably similar heights over the Harbor. Also the pylon gives you a museum tour with history and educational items about the bridge construction (I don't know if you get those on the bridge climb). My wife enjoyed this option, it was far cheaper, much quicker and self guided, and you get a great view. If you just gotta climb the bridge, go ahead. If you want a positive alternative, here you go... And for those that cant seem to find this option..its in the pylon closest to the opera house. Find the stairway up to the bridge itself, and you enter the pylon from the sideway off the bridge...not from the base down bay the edge of the bay..Approx 100 steps to the top."

            "review": "Harbour Bridge climb views (without so much of the 'climb'). I recently took my in-laws for a bit of a tourist day out around Sydney. They had never been to Sydney. One of my favourite things to do with people to help them get their bearings is to go on a walk through The Rocks (this sets the scene nicely), and then up onto the Harbour Bridge pathway going north.As you walk up through the Rocks you pass many local attractions that really make you feel you've arrived in Sydney. From Circular Quay, pass the MCA. Then walk up Argyle cut. Just before the underpass there are some 'ancient' stairs through an archway to your right. walk up these. They are old, originally cut by convicts I think. At the top of the stairs turn left and follow the pathway around behind the local pub, The Glenmore Hotel. As a side note you can stop here on your way back and enjoy a beer. It's a great spot for a light bite too. Cross the road and head up another set of steps onto the Harbour Bridge walkway. Don't forget your camera. As you walk along the pathway heading northbound toward the bridge you get glimpses of views down into The Rocks and eastward to the Opera House and beyond. It's just exhilarating to see people's faces when they see the harbour for the first time. But don't stop there. Carry on toward the harbour bridge until you get to the Harbour Bridge Pylon. This is the gigantic pillar made of steel and stonework. You'll find the entrance to the Pylon Lookout here. Now, before I go on, please be aware there are stairs. If you've recently had knee surgery don't push yourself. There are some 100+ steps to climb. There are floors along the way at different levels. On each level is either an exhibition about the bridge build or indicators about the views at the top.The Pylon Lookout is $15 per adult to visit. Considering you climb to where the bridge climbers go to and pay $150+ for the privilege I think the Pylon Lookout is well worth the money. It's well worth the climb up the steps to the top. Even if you are nervous about heights. Once you reach the viewing area you can walk around the whole pylon in safety. Everywhere you look there are sights to see. Looking west The Blue Mountains can be seen in the distance. Homebush and the Olympic park closer to the city. The Parramatta river becomes Sydney Harbour at Gladesville bridge. The inner west meets the city at Anzac Bridge, just infront of Balmain and the inner harbour islands called Cockatoo and Goat. To the south you see the Royal National Park in the distance. Australia's first national park reserve. Of course right in front of you there is the city and many iconic buildings. To the east you can see the main part of the harbour, circular quay, the opera house. Right the way to Watsons Bay in the distance and around to the entrance to the harbour. To the north is, well The Bridge itself. Then the lower north shore suburbs. All in all on any day this is a brisk afternoon out. The whole walk from The Glenmore, up onto the Bridge and Pylon Lookout, and back will probably take about 1.5 hrs to 2 hours depending on your pace. You could walk right over the bridge to Kirribilli and Milsons Point too. Then catch a ferry back to Circular Quay or Darling Harbour. Hope you enjoy my review and enjoy the outing even more. And don't forget to stop for a brew at The Glenmore Hotel or Australian Hotel on your way back down from the Pylon Lookout. You will have earned it."

If one flight of stairs is manageable for you, then this lookout could be reached by taking your time as there are spots to rest at the top of each flight, and displays of interesting information as well.I didn't think it was hard to find, it's in the south east pylon of the Harbour Bridge, but we did know the way up from The Rocks.

If you want the views from Sydney Harbour Bridge, but don't want to do the bridge climb over the top (which is expensive, and not possible with children under 10) it's well worth walking up inside the SE Pylon. The museam within the plyon is small but informative, and the views from the top are great. The stairs inside the pylon are normal stairs and fine for childen - though there are quite a lot of steps! The outdoor viewing area is open to the elements but safe, and there are steps for children to stand on so they can see over the wall. The only problem is finding the entrance - you can't access it from under the bridge, you need to walk on the footpath beside the road on the bridge level to get to the entrance."

We got a bit lost trying to find the entrance to the Pylon walk, the signage could be improved, but this attraction is worth hunting out.I am a bit phobic about heights so no way would I do the bridge climb but this gives you terrific views over Sydney without the fear factor. The 200 steps are not too difficult and there are displays along the way to enjoy. But the photo ops from the top are the best - a 360 degree view over Sydney, a different angle for pics of the Opera House and close up views of the bridge with the climbers in action too.The videos shown in the room before the exit are great too.Well worth the entrance fee of about $12."

To climb the bridge is really expensive and it is my understanding that you can not take a camera. You can walk/run across the bridge for free and I suggest that you do. There is a small park on the other side of the bridge that gives you a different view of the city and opera house which is worth the walk. You can also climb to the top of the pylon lookout which we did. I am not sure of the cost to do this, as our hotel gave us a voucher. The pylon lookout was nice and gave you a good view and you can use your camera there. Something to consider if you don't want to spend the money to climb to the top of the bridge."

I love being able to see all the way to the Blue Mountains and all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Take a look down too and you can see the famous car with the boulder in the middle of it.

Each landing had a fascinating display of the design, building and workers who created this iconic city symbol.Finally at the top, we had the entire city spread out before us, with magnificent views over the harbour and Opera House,. the Gap and the bustling ferry boats. Below us toiled the Bridge climbers making their way to the highest point, and just across the way, in Circular quay, a magnificent cruise ship gleamed in the sun.

The Pylon Lookout was a great substitute for us for the Bridge Climbing Experience. While we're adventurists and would have loved to strap on a harness and make our way up the longest single span arch bridge in the world, the cost of the Bridge Climb made it out of our reach. We settled for the Pylon Lookout and were pleasantly surprised! We were able to walk to the lookout from the The Rocks - just head toward the pylons. There's about 200 stairs you have to climb before you enter the exhibit, so be prepared to break a sweat. It was only $30 a person for our tickets, and it was much more interactive than we would would have imagined. I will warn that there are several flights of stairs headed up - thank goodness there was a water fountain halfway up because we had not brought anything to drink. We had our picture taken sitting on a ledge, as if we were sitting on the bridge before it was finished, and it made a nice souvenir. There were exhibits leading up to the pylon, both interesting and educational. When we fiinally reached the top, the view of Sydney is splendid. The harbour and sight of the Sydney opera house alone is enough to make you swoon. We spent a good half hour walking around, feeling the wind whip around us, and admiring the view. I loved reading about the making of the bridge in the room attached to the lookout, and learned how white cats have a special connection to the bridge. I would def recommend the Pylon Lookout for those who are not afraid of climbing lots of stairs!"

The displays were very good - quick \"sound bites\" for people who want the once over lightly,and more detail for those who want it.A superb view in all four directions, not very bus when we were there,and so we could spend lots of time just gazing at the view.Probably not as spectacular as the bridge climb (as other reviewers have noted) but far cheaper and far more accessible!"

We had planned to participate in the climb to the top, but in talking with the concierge at our hotel decided it really was a lot to spend when we could go up in the Pylon for so much less($268+ compared to $14!). We decided that was just not necessary for us. That being said, I understand insurance, equipment, etc all has to be paid for, so, if you want to take part, it's up to you. Just be aware, the Pylon is about halfway up as far as the Bridge & you get great views from there as well. Views from the bridge are AWESOME, even if you are just walking!! Honestly, the views ANYWHERE around the harbour are so beautiful, don't feel pressured to pay such a huge fee to walk to the top of the bridge; that's the point I wanted to make. Sydneysiders have a wonderful treasure here."

From the Pylon we had an amazing view of Sydney Harbour at a very low price which included a photo, there was a very interesting display of work in progress and facts. The only problem was the directions and the information outside the Pylon entrance. We found that from The Rocks following the signs to the Bridgewalk would get you in the right area and eventually give you a specific sigh to the Pylon Lookout. Once outside the entrance there was no information relating to openning times or clear clarification you are in the right place. This obviously not a problem if is open when you arrive, but as we were a little early was an issue."

We walked the same staircase that the bridge climbers go up I believe, but stopped off and went onto the pylon. It was an absolute spectacular view of the bridge, Opera House, and a small glass window around the perimeter of the pylon with different cities' locations. The best plus for the pylon was the ability for you to take pictures with your own camera however you want. You didn't have to pay a fortune for the photos taken on the bridge climb with maybe some people you don't know. The views are obviously from a lower platform but its not that big of a difference and everything can still be seen perfectly. I loved it."

This is a place to visit to get fantastic views of the city and Sydney harbour from the iconic Harbour Bridge.Here's a tip, I find that it is easier to find my way to the Pylon Lookout if I were to head to Cumberland Street, the Rocks, from Wynyard train station (than Circular Quay train station). Please walk along the pedestrain pathway on the Eastern side of the Harbour Bridge for better views on your way to the Pylon Lookout.There are interesting exhibitis at Pylon Lookout that provides the history of the Harbour Bridge and more. It would take about 1 - 2 hours to enjoy the various exhibits. Remember to take a look at the exhibit on the early plywood model of the centre-pin. This massive centre-pin was crucial in fastening the two half of the arches of the Harbour Bridge together.Be prepared to climb some stairways. There are about 200 stairs to viewing gallery of the Pylon Lookout. As such, please wear comfortable walking shoes.Please check the visiting hours before visiting.

We watched the rows of bridge climbers walk up along the edge of the arch and checked out the movie which told about how the bridge was built.
