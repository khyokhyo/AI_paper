Unfortunately the building is under renovation and more than half of it is closed. We were aware of this before we started, but decided to see it anyway. The major portion of the mosaics are in the closed section and we were disappointed that we could not see the most attractive part of the museum. We felt that the entrance fee should have been reduced in view of the reduction in the area available to view, however the full price was charged."

I left feeling a massively frustrated as the entire building was under canvas tents and the main rooms of the church were closed to visitors due to repairs. The mosaics that we could see were stunning, true works of art, but we picked the wrong time I guess. What should have been a 1 hour visit ended in less than 10. We purchased museum passes from Hagia Sophia and the staff never mentioned any repair work and limited access to Chora. I will return and hopefully give a more positive review."

All the mosaics date back to early 14th century and are truly striking in their beauty. Getting there might be an issue if travelling on your own. Taking ferry, then walking alongside the historical city walls most probably is the easiest option."

The church has the most beautiful and intact mosaics your would ever see. With the museum pass, the entrance is free but please spend a little extra on the audio guide as that makes the tour much more exciting and informative.When we visited a part of the church was closed for restoration but it still left us breathless when we first entered it. The church is a little out of the central city so we had to take the tram and the metro and then walk for about 10 mins to get to it. On our way back we walked Downhill for 15-20 minutes to the ferry stop Ayvansaray (using a GPS app on the cell phone) and took public ferry through the golden horn back to Emin\u00f6n\u00fc. The whole trip was worth it. Highly recommended for history buffs."

Kariye doesn't get as many visitors as some of the other more famous attractions, mainly because it's not walking distance from the rest of them. But it is well worth a visit. The main cupola has been under renovation for the last 18 months but the different naves of the church are still amazing. They do a great job of lighting it and there's a nice giftshop with some good books. A few nice cafes around it to. If you take a taxi, say Kariye (KAH-ree-ye) as they may not know the 'Chora' name."

The mosaics and frescos of that church are really something a traveller must see. Ticket price was same as Hagia Sophia which expensive considering the Church is tiny in comparison. Covered scaffolding around most of the outside prevented any view of the outer building itself. That said, the scale of fresco restoration work and low number of tourist, made this place one of my Top 5 places in Istanbul."

The Chora Church is quite small, and the center portion of the interior is closed for restoration right now, but you still get to see plenty. The exterior is also scaffolded right now (April 2016)---but again, there is lots to see inside and it left me speechless. My husband and I walked all around maybe 3 times and I could have done it 3 more. Right outside is a little cafe where we had some tea and took a break in the shade. If I lived in Istanbul I would visit the Chora Church constantly.We took the tram to get there. Once you get off you have about a 20 minute walk through some kind of interesting neighborhoods. If you like a bit of adventure and wandering this one is definitely a must see. It's 15 Turkish lire to get in, but it's free if you have the Museum Card. Hours: 9-7 daily but CLOSED WEDNESDAY."

We got a fine, long view of the old crenellated fortifications. The church would have been worth the trip, even if the latter hadn\u2019t been interesting. Although the sacristy was closed for renovation, the domed side chapels and arched corridors were rich in mosaics and painted frescoes. One entire section seemed devoted to the life of Mary, including her death. Another depicted various apostles and saints important to Orthodox Christians. A particularly fine mural showed Christ raising the just from the dead on the Day of Judgment. To one side, wealthy sinners appeared to be trying to sneak off under a red and gold canopy. Many of the paintings and mosaics were only partial, and some of the faces had been defaced. Nonetheless, the combined effect of these 13th and 14th Century works was inspiring, historically, aesthetically and spiritually."

Nothing on their web site informed us about the major renovations happening. The Chora is a decent taxi ride away from the Sultanahmet area--and the trams/subways do not go to that area as it is just outside of the periphery of old Istanbul. We hopped in a cab, paid about $20 US for the ride out. We got to the Church only to see it surrounded by signage detailing the multi-stage renovations happening. We went in and then only were able to see the outer areas of the church-- as the major portion was under renovation. This was really disappointing. We spent about 20 minutes taking photos of the few mosaics that we could see and wishing we could get inside to see many more. We walked around the building and didn't see anything else--more residential neighborhood than anything. It took a while to get a cab to take us back. Spending about 1/2 hour and $40 US in a cab was not worth the trip. Check to see if renovations are still underway before making the trip out there. They do accept the Istanbul Museum Card: I'm not sure what the cost would be for regular admission."

These are, without doubt, the best mosaics I have ever seen. Chora Church is a bit out of town, but the tram ride is worth the effort. And it's interesting to see the outskirts of Istanbul at the same time. Even though they are from about the 10th century (just try wrapping your head around that!), the mosaics and frescoes are still rich in color. The mosaics absolutely glitter. Some are complete scenes from the life of Christ, others have patches where the mosaics have fallen away. There are people available to provide tours, it's a great idea. They can explain all the scenes you will see. The artwork of both the mosaics and frescoes is exceptional, they do not have a flat look at all, which is amazing considering their age. We were there on a weekday in April, and were two of about only 20 people in the church. If you have the opportunity, go see these mosaics. You will never regret it."

During the Ottoman era in the 16th century it was converted to a mosque and recently in 1948 to a museum.

To get there, take the M1 metro line to the Topkapi-Ulubatli station. When you exit the station look for the old Byzantine wall (sections of which are in decent shape amazingly) and walk along it uphill. After about 15min you'll come upon the impressive Mihrimah Sultan Camii (good visit too if you have time). Also just past that you'll come upon good sections where you can access the top of the city walls for awesome view. Chora Museum is just another 5min walk downhill through the neighbourhood from there.As others have said, the exterior is under restoration and parts of interior as well. But definitely do spend some time inside as you marvel at the well-preserved and dazzling mosaics.After the visit if you're up for more walking, you're only about 10min walk through the neighbourhood to Fethiye Museum. Though after Chora it will feel nowhere as impressive but the walk was lovely as you get a glimpse into their daily lives. After that, another 15min walk gets you to the Fener ferry terminal where you can enjoy water views and get back to Eminonu (New Mosque, Spice Bazaar, etc)"

We took the metro from the direction of the airport and exited at Topaki. From there we took a taxi and the driver found it very easily. as of March the admission was 15 lira, audio guides were 15 lira also. A guide was offering his services for 70 lira for the three of us. We declined. The main room of the church is closed due to restoration plus the exterior is covered with scaffolding. We are grateful to know that this beautiful place is being well cared for and restored. The signage on the outside explained some of the building's history and included pictures of things we would not be able to see. What we did see was beautiful and I am glad we checked this place off our places to visit. Compared to what we have seen in the Hagia Sophia The Chora Church left us wanting more. The neighborhood in which it is located is fun to explore including some of the tourist gift shops. Down the hill are some restaurants and bakeries."

From the ferry dock you'll see the historic Walls of Theodosius to the west. Cross the park and the street and start heading up the hill, keeping the walls to your right. Along the way to the church are some interesting sites: Tekfur Palace, Kastoria Synagogue Wall and Gate, Egikapi Gate and Surdibi Cemetery. (Unfortunately construction at Kazasker Ivaz Efendi Mosque made it impossible to view this Sinan-designed building or the Dungeons of Anemas and Blackernai Palace ruins.) No signs directing you to the Chora Church so if you don't have a good map you may need to ask directions once you reach the highest point of the walls, just east of a busy street. Note: We used CityMaps2Go for Istanbul (free app) and found it a great way to navigate the city. It took us right to the church. We retraced our steps after the church and enjoyed a beautiful sunset ferry ride back to Eminonu."

The interior mosaics and frescoes are absolutely beautiful and despite only approximately 1/3 rd of the museum being open to the public due to renovations being done, it is absolutely worthwhile visiting.The name is apt in that chora means \"outside the city\", which it is.On entering, the mosaic panels in the two entrance narthexes depict scenes from the lives of the Virgin and Christ, as described in the Bible. Despite the fact that these were covered by whitewash when the church was converted to a mosque in the 16th century, they have been remarkably restored and cleaned.There are several curio shops, an open-air cafe and quaint cobble stone roads surrounding the Church, as well as as very well preserved old wooden buildings that are quite fascinating to see.To get there, exit either the Topkapi Tram line (orange line) or the Metrobus (brown line) at Edirnekapi and then follow the well marked sign boards that say \"Kuriye Muzise\" to get to the Church."

Better known as the Church of the Holy Savior in Chora, this unassuming late Byzantine church is famous for its mosaics, which are among the finest surviving works of Byzantine art in the world. Originally constructed in the fourth century AD, it was rebuilt by Theodore Melitoches, the Byzantine Grand Logothete, or Imperial Chancellor, at the beginning of the 14th century. It's now a museum well worth a visit, especially for its wonderfully preserved mosaic and fresco cycles depicting the life of the Virgin Mary, the Passion and the Last Judgment. Above the doorway is a portrait of Melitoches himself, presenting the church to the Virgin enthroned. The church represents the final flowering of Byzantine art before the empire entered its death throes, and the mosaic figures also show the influence of early Renaissance art."

However, I'd encourage you to make Chora Church a top priority after seeing the Hagia Sophia for a couple reasons. First, it is tucked away in a very non-tourist part of the city, so it's actually relatively unknown and therefore has much smaller crowds than the top attractions. Second, almost every wall and ceiling is covered in frescoes and mosaics which are the main reason to go Because the church is small, you can see all of the Byzantine art that lines the walls and ceilings close up, and in many places there are pieces that tell stories from the lives of Jesus and Mary.Full disclosure: the church has been under restoration for some time now, and as of Feb 2016 it is still being restored. I asked one of the attendants if there was a projected finish date and he said that the restoration is ongoing and that they could not give an estimated finish date at that time. The whole church is covered on the outside, so you won't really get to see the exterior facade. Also, the main section of the church is closed to visitors; only the outer hallways and foyers are open. That said, you can still see 80% of the frescoes and mosaics as most are the aforementioned hallways and foyers. It is still certainly worth your time to make the trip to see the intimate and beautifully preserved Byzantine church."

Part of it is John Freely's Fault (Strolling Through Istanbul) because he explains what everything is and what's there, what's missing, what's being restored, what's in fresco.

My excellent rating is for the famous mosaics and striking frescoes currently accessible in this former Byzantine church and Ottoman mosque. But the nave is closed due to restoration work, and scaffolding covers the entire exterior. Some people may prefer to spend their time elsewhere due to the work in progress, especially because coming here requires a taxi or a long ride on public transport. To save time, we took a taxi from Sultanahmet, which cost 21 TL. The admission fee is 15 TL Those who visit, however, will be rewarded by seeing the Byzantine mosaics and frescoes that exist outside the nave. They went on the walls between 1315 and 1321 but were covered under a layer of plaster when the church became a mosque. The art, which depicts the lives of Christ and the Virgin Mary, was restored when the building became a museum. I thought the side chapel was quite interesting with its scenes from the Old Testament. A fresco that shows Christ raising Adam and Eve from their sarcophagi was particularly impressive.The gift shop sells guidebooks that explain the mosaics and frescoes, and a guide approached us for hire to do the same. We opted to use a guidebook that we brought with us. There were only a few other visitors there when we went mid-morning on a weekday."

It is one of the city's major attractions, and should not be missed, despite its distance from the Sulthanhamet. The church can be a bit hard to find, so it might be a good idea to cab there. Once there, allow for anything between 20 minutes to 2 hours to visit the church, depending on the level of detail you want to get into. My son and I followed the detailed descriptions available in John Freely's _Strolling through Istanbul_ and took two hours to see everything. There are also guidebooks available for sale on site. You can take photographs, as long as you don't use a flash.A visit to the Kariye Museum is easily combined with visits to the Mirrimah mosque, one of the most beautiful in the city, and to the section of the land walls that occupies the highest point in the city, providing spectacular views. We took the ferry to Avansaray, cabbed to Kariye, walked to the mosque and down the length of the walls to the Topkapi gate, where we caught the tram back to Galata."

And if you have read my reviews about Istanbul you will know my true dislike of the Istanbul taxi system. So like a true Explorer I went out of my way to find the best way to get here the local way.Here's how I did it.From Emin\u00f6n\u00fc Bus terminal take the bus number 38E to Edrinekapi. Get off at the stop Edrinekapi. You ll see a tiny Street where bikes are parked just off the same side you get off the bus. It ll look like you are in middle of nowhere but let that get to you. Once you your bearing you can navigate easily (download TripAdvisor offline maps) and it's as easy as that. Once again entry fee and a smallish church. Now many reviews said you need 30mins tops. Believe me that is not the case. If you love historical facts and have read the Bible this is truly the most awesome place you'll want to be in. I for one couldn't peel my eyes off the ceiling. So full of intricately art. Restored. Fresco and mosaic. Unless you see this wonder you will not believe a word of what I say.One more thing this is under restoration and has been for years so some parts are closed bur what is do get to see it beyond any words I can conjure to describe this place. Kariye museum or the church of St.George of Chora depicts the genealogy of the Christ and the Virgin Mary. Finally our trip back was a wonder in itself. We decided we wanted to take the ferry back to Eminounu. So we walked down the cobbled streets opp direction of where we came from and ended up walking along the most beautiful path way right up to the ruined city walls. It's a pleasant walk with less tourists around. Enjoyed a lovely cup of Turkish coffee.Once we figured out where we where and to save time we got another bus back to Eminounu. As I mentioned before if you have offline maps and the Metro maps you can figure out how to get there.. It's very logical."

It's all uphill and through some questionable neighborhoods. Thank goodness for my smartphone GPS and Google Maps, or I'm sure we would have gotten lost.In any case, we came up to the church from the back side and immediately saw that the exterior was all covered in scaffolding. Not too big of a deal, since there's nothing special about the exterior.However, upon entering the church, we saw signs that the main nave was closed for renovation. That's pretty much the bulk of the church that is closed. What's left are some hallways that admittedly do have some nice mosaics and frescoes. But really ... that's it.After spending all that time getting to the church, it was a big letdown. With Chora Church being so far away from most other tourist sites, it's really not worth the trip.

One can believe that shortly after the creation of these beautiful mosaics, the Ottomans took over the land and some of these artists fled to Europe and were part of the onset of the Renaissance. So, History and aesthetics-wise, this is a mustsee creation."

When istanbul was captured by e the conqueror it was converted into a mosque, with the bell tower converted into a minaret and the extensive medieval art whitewashed and sometimes destroyed. When turkey became a a republic 90 years ago, it was converted into a museum. Many of the centuries old paintings / mosaics have since been partially restored with renovations that are ongoing. The entire inner sanctuary is off limits presently and for. the foreseeable future. However the art remaining is an excellent example of medieval christian art which is well worth seeing. This is difficult to find as are many of the secondary sites in istanbul. Travel books give directions but there is no direct route via public transportation and the church sits at a high altitude. Taxi is easiest and walking with a good gps is about three miles from Sultanahmet. We walked which took us though fascinating neighborhoods and gave us a good workout. Walking is not for the faint of heart or short of time. Four stars were awarded both for the interference of the restoration and difficulty getting there. Do not hire a guide just for this site as it is small and easily done on your own. Tickets are ten lire ($3.50 us) or free with the museum pass."

The Kariye museum is someway out, away from the main tourist spots- combining it with a wander along the Theodosian walls and a ferry trip, back along the Golden Horn made for a brilliant morning's site-seeing.First the journey there: you'll need a map (the hotel provided us with an adequate one)- we got the tram and then the metro to Topkapi (which refers to one of the gates in the old town walls-not the palace)- this deposits you right by the walls. We then wandered along (sometimes inside, sometimes outside, and sometimes on the city walls) travelling northwards. There are signs at the next big gap in the walls (at Fevzi Pasha c) that direct you to the museum.The museum itself is simply stunning- an amazing array of mosaics, interspersed with some fine frescoes- it'll take a good hour to take it all in. Our guide book was fabulous for deciphering the images ( some are not common in Western churches). There are a load of cafes with terrac seating if you fancy a break.Next we made our way down to the Golden Horn- this is where we did get a bit lost (only for a few minutes)- Don't follow the line of the walls all the way- head East to avoid the dead end that we ended up in ! We then caught the ferry down the Golden Horn from Ayvansaray- it runs on the same payment system as the Metro and tram. Boats leave Ayvansaray at 40 minutes past the hour and take 30 mins to go back to Karakoy ( where we got the tram back to Sultanahmet. We had a great morning and would fully recommend this little itinerary."

It is now just a museum and located in a residential area. The taxi had to drop us off about 1-2 blocks from it; the bus stop was further away. Extensive renovations are under way and are expected to last until 2016 sometime. They seem to charge the full admission charge even though about half the facility was closed to the public because of renovations- however, according to the guide book , more than 90% of the viewable works of art were in the section that was still open. The art expert in our group found this to be one of the best collections she had ever seen. Hint: they seem to regularly have a problem with their credit card machine, so bring a lot of cash...or be prepared for about a 20 minute walk (round trip) up and down a steep hill, with few sidewalks, to the nearest cash machine.

For full impact, you'll want to go with a guide or a guidebook to highlight the significance and order of the pictures. The whole church tells a story, which flows from the walls to the ceiling and back. Our guide was able to point out the story of Mother Mary from the time she was a young girl, for instance, and how the upbringing depicted on the walls tied with both ancient prophesies as well as nods to modern realities (for instance, why there was a baker/wheat in one picture - as much to do with taxes as anything else, in the eyes of some scholars!). Bring a camera with a zoom, or opera glasses. You can take pictures (no flash), but what you'll really appreciate is the ability to zoom in and see the incredible detail of the individual mosaic tiles. Your smart phone will take great photos but what you really want to do is pan around live and get a sense of the story, as well as the details.Go early if you can. The church fills with waves of guided tours. Ours stayed for three or four hours ... others duck in for an hour. Plan a neck massage afterwards since you will be spending a lot of time looking up!"

From the moment we first entered the church, we were completely awed and speechless by the richness and beauty of the marbled walls, the artfully crafted dome ceilings and archways and the intricately adorned mosaics on the upper walls and ceilings. The current church was built about 1100AD after an earthquake damaged the original. Then the church was damaged by Crusaders in the 1200's. In the early 1300's, the Byzantine prime minister, Theordore Metochites, oversaw the church's reconstruction. In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Empire converted it into a mosque. The frescoes and mosaics were whitewashed over and remained hidden from daylight until the late 1940's when they were rediscovered and restored. The mosaics and frescoes are the most beautiful examples dating from the last period of Byzantine painting (14th century). When we visited the church, the Central Nave and Apse were closed for renovation. However, we were able to visit the three other sections of the church: Outer Narthex, Inner Narthex and the Parekklesion (side chapel). Begin your tour in the Outer Narthex, then the Inner Narthex and end in the Parekklesion. Inside the Narthex sections are richly adorned mosaics all across the walls and ceilings, depicting different stories in the bible. Advice: It's a good idea to have a guide or have a book to help you with an explanation of each mosaic. Rick Steves 's Istanbul book is a good one. The Perekklesion section was the mortuary chamber for Theodore Metochites and his family and is completely decorated with frescoes. Many of the frescoes depict the afterlife and salvation. Unlike other Byzantine churches where the dead were buried under the ground, instead they were laid to rest in the built in niches of the Perekklesion. Some of the frescoes are faded but it is easy to imagine just how striking and brilliant they would have been in their day.PLEASE see this church during your visit to Istanbul...You will NOT be disappointed. It is not located right in the heart of old town but you can take a taxi ride which is not expensive and totally worth every penny."

At the time of our visit only a small portion of the museum was available for visit so a little disappointing.

It is on the western side of the old city. Unfortunately the complete exterior of the church is covered with tin roofing and scaffolding due to restoration work. Even inside some areas are closed. For the areas that are closed pictures of those mosaics with explanatory text are displayed outside the church.The mosaics on the arches, walls, ceiling and domes are beautiful. Some of them in relatively better condition some almost fallen off. They have an audio guide facility. Each mosaic is numbered and by pressing on that number on your audio guide you can listen to the description of that particular mosaic.There is a souvenir shop inside the church and some outside as well."

So there were lots of people in a small place and other tours were going on in various languages and I could hear a little of this and that from them. I guess these are from the 1300s or maybe a bit older. There are many tourist shops out front too, some with some interesting stuff. I also liked the old Turkish wooden houses in the area out front.

While the cab ride from the Sultanahmet might cost you only 25 lira, the cabs on the way back will cost double that. Why? There are few of them near the church and they know it. Also, they'll want to take the long (and faster) route via the \"seaside.\" In sum, I can't remember the ticket price but let's estimate: For two people: 25 lira cab ride; 2 entrance tix = 60 lira; 2 audio guides = 40 lira; postcards or trinkets = 20 lira; 2 cokes at cafe next to museum; 50 lira cab ride back to old city.

Got there late morning and was closed until 1 so went in the adjacent cafe/ returns not which was very nice and good value. Beware of thieves in this area. A guy asked if he could clean my shoes, did so and then asked for 50 Turkish Lira, which I wasn't going to give, but he helped himself from my wallet!"

However, there is a restaurant serving Ottoman food (which is very different from modern Turkish food) just around the church that's worth your visit!"

There at the exit barriers you will find a small Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality handout showing the walking route to the Kariye Museum.

Yes, they are full of old byzantine mosaics of a great value, but you see it all in less than 5 minutes. Plus there is a big souvenir shop INSIDE the church with a super bored cashier. The church is surrounded by many shops selling beautiful hand-painted tiles, postcards, souvenirs etc and huge terrace of restaurants and caf\u00e9s like two meters from the entrance to the church. It is quite far away from the city, if you are staying in Sultanahmet and quite a walk distant from the nearest metro station.

It is now just a museum and located in a residential area. The taxi had to drop us off about 1-2 blocks from it; the bus stop was further away. Extensive renovations are under way and are expected to last until 2016 sometime. They seem to charge the full admission charge even though about half the facility was closed to the public because of renovations- however, according to the guide book , more than 90% of the viewable works of art were in the section that was still open. The art expert in our group found this to be one of the best collections she had ever seen. Hint: they seem to regularly have a problem with their credit card machine, so bring a lot of cash...or be prepared for about a 20 minute walk (round trip) up and down a steep hill, with few sidewalks, to the nearest cash machine. The guide books(for a price) which are available here are excellent\u2026albeit written in questionable English. Highly recommended"

It took us a few hours but you can stop off at shops to buy water on the way. We visited the various mouments and mosques on our way- including the aqueducts, the Suleymaniye Mosque, the fatih mosque, the old walls of Istanbul and then on to the Chora church. A great day to spend discovering Istanbul. This part of Istanbul has hardly any tourists but is also very interesting. Grab a map or use your phone GPS to guide you. Our hotel recommended we do this walk. After the Chora church we walked down the hill through all the narrow streets of old houses to the water front and caught the ferry back around to the main Sultanahmet District . If you have transport card you can use this or simply buy a ticket at the office. The Chora church was one of my highlights in Istanbul. The mozaics are so old and have so much history. You can use your museum pass to enter. Unfortunately not all the church is open at the moment due to renovations. However , you still get to see some amazing paintings. The staff at the door spoke very good English and were able to give us directions afterwards. They also have a nice gift school on site where my son bought a history book. After you leave the The Chora church you walk down the hill through a maze of narrow streets and markets and shops. We got very lost however it did not matter in the end as we managed to come out along the water front and could then find the ferry stop. Although this looks to be a poor part of Istanbul we did not feel unsafe and actually asked for directions a few times."

I was in a restaurant in Sultanahmet when my neighbor started talking about the Chora Church and though it was being restored and scaffolding was everywhere, it was not a place to miss. Others told me that too. I took a cab to the spot and I instantly realized I was in a special place. Small, perfectly scaled, set in an open area designed to spend time meditating on the exterior of the church, I was taken in by its welcoming size and exquisite art and architecture. The fact that it was \"wrapped\" Christo-like by delicate scaffolding added to its almost surreal and special nature. Inside the galleries were mosaics and paintings that would take several visits to begin to absorb fully. Though the main sanctuary was off limits as of March 2015, there was plenty to be astonished by. Walking in the surrounding neighborhood only added a fuller appreciation for the delicacy and power of this richly documented bit of church and architectural history."

Outside the church we had perhaps the best meal of our vacation, at Asitane, which specializes in old Ottoman recipes from the palace. I can't recommend it highly enough. A beautiful and quiet garden setting, with a cool breeze. Plan for two-and-a-half or three hours for both a leisurely lunch and the tour of the church.

Because of the restoration work you can see nothing of the outside of the building. Some of the inside was not acessible, although most of the frescos were in the parts you can visit. Possibly in order to protect the frescos the interior of the building is kept in very low low lighting, so much of the detail and vitality of the works is lost. I saw much more detail back in the hotel in the photos I took, than I was able to see on the day.My advice, don't go, use the money you save to buy the book with pictures and text, you'll get a lot more out the book than you would from a visit."

Overall it took approx 1 hour travelling time. On T1 you have to change at Topkapi stop and catch T4 tram three stops to Edimekapi. Going from Taksim on M2 line would I'd think be much quicker. Either way is cheap. It can be confusing coming out of the station at Edimekapi as it leads out onto a major intersection with no obvious signs of which way to go. However, there is a map on the wall of the station and the member of staff there will also be able to provide you with a copy. The road signs will appear once on to the main road - Kariye - it is approx 10 minute walk to the museum down a couple of quiet side streets.As mentioned many times the museum is undergoing a major restoration so only a few places are open. I know that people have gripes about the cost 15TL but in England you would pay that and more at museums for parking your car. By my conversion it is about \u00a33.60. In my opinion this was the most impressive of all the sights I saw on my Istanbul trip. The mosaics are so beautiful and the detail that is able to be seen is truly amazing. They are true works of art depicting stories from the bible. Whether it is because people dont visit becasue it is undergoing restoration, or it is not in the central run or maybe it was earlier in the morning but there was a calmness about the place and it didnt come across as overun with tourists and i was able to stand for long periods admiring the fine mosaic pieces. Highly recommended"

They include saints (including an excellent picture of St. Nicholas of Bursa, the American Santa Claus), images of hell, heaven, the Virgin Mary, All in excellent condition, displayed in a typically Greek Orthodox system of naves and arches, all photographable (though No Flash). Two caveats. The images are so complex, so filled with symbols and historical figures, that either a guide--or a cheating browsing of the guidebook in the gift shop is essential. Also, in mid-2015, some of the rooms are being re-constructed. Still, there's enough to satisfy even the most jaded museum-goer. A few minutes away is another church (Fethiye Muzezi), more limited, but with nice surrounding gardens."

It isn't the easiest place to get to; it is in the Edirnekapi borough that is on the south side of the Golden Horn and to the west of the old city. The nearest tram stop is Edirnekapi so the best way to get there is either by bus or a yellow death machine, aka taxi.We took one one of the latter, with the fare from Ortak\u00f6y being a very resonable 20t/\u00a35. Crickey, in London that would just about get you to the end of the street. If you're taking a taxi, remember that the museum's Turkish name is 'Kariye'.Much of the exterior is clad in scaffolding and some of the interior rooms are closed off for renovation - a very necessary task given the age of the structure and fragility of the contents - but what is on display is more than enough.It is hard to describe but it's fair to say this; a) it is even better than you imagine it will be and b) it moved me to tears. Even if you are not spiritual in any way you have to marvel at the intricate and painstaking nature of the work, which is awe-inspiring. You have to remember that this was the ancient equivalent of social media; communicated a given message in the available medium for others to appreciate.It is quite dark inside and flash photography is not permitted. I had to use a highish ISO of 1600-2000 to be able to get the pictures and you will want to be able to capture photographs of the interior as the frescoes and mosaics are so beautiful, plus to capture the sense of permanence that they possess.The entrance fee was approx. 30t/\u00a37.50 which was ridiculously cheap considering what you are privileged to see there. If you are religious, it is a joy to be able to spot stories from the Bible portrayed on the walls and ceilings.It is testament to the power of religious understanding that this place has survived, given that it was subsumed by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century and became a mosque for almost 500 years before being converted to a museum. It was one of the first churches established after Emperor Constantine brought Christianity to Byzantium, dating back to the 5th century. It is a unique collection of ancient frescoes and murals that are part of a UNESCO world heritage. You only have to recall what our national 'hero' Henry VIII did in the dissolution of the monasteries to appreciate how important tolerance is to a national's identity and history.We spend around 30-45 minutes here and would come back again on a future visit. Perhaps the most entertaining part was the taxi ride back, when the driver decided to go down one-way street...the wrong way...and then proceeded to do most of the rest of the journey this way. In between emergency stops for vehicles crossing who weren't expected to us emerging from the wrong side. Scary and hilarous in equal measure."

Still, the mosaics we were able to see were breathtaking. It's amazing how well preserved and ornate they are. We had been unsure about visiting, but after seeing the beauty were very happy with our decision and would recommend it.

I think the one of the best example Byzantine art besides Hagia Sofia. Take the audio guide! It was the first church on this site was built in the 4th century as part of a monastery complex outside the city walls of Constantinople. This is the reason for the \"in Chora\" part of its name - chora zonton means \"in the country\" in Greek. The present building dates from the 11th century and decorated in the 14th. The Church of St. Savior in Chora (formerly the Kariye Camii and now the Kariye M\u00fczesi) in Istanbul contains one of the best-preserved collections of Byzantine mosaics and frescoes anywhere."

Firstly the site is experiencing a tremendous amount of restoration and preservation work, you cannot view the church from the outside at the moment and a large portion of the inside is also cordoned off. So not seeing the outside of this beautiful church is a tad disappointing it is great seeing the level of effort being put into maintaining the site for the future. The mosaics themselves are some of the best I have ever seen and the masterly level of the craftsmanship present is incredible. The city walls is also a short stroll from the church and is a welcome reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the manic center of Istanbul. *Just a good tip, my girlfriend was wearing shorts on her trip out here, take note the neighborhood comes across as quite conservative and she felt a bit uncomfortable in her shorts which is normally perfectly acceptable in the city center of Istanbul so to avoid any strange feelings cover up)"

Then when you enter the west section, there are some beautiful frescos. Having a guide book or a guide will inform you more about the little things to notice.

You could take a complicated route via bus (which only accepts the transit cards), but this seemed like less of a good idea than taking a taxi. If you have been doing your reading, you know taking a taxi is a shaky thing in Istanbul. We happened to make it there and the driver merely kept our change. We considered this a success. Even though the nave is closed for repairs, this was a stunning and beautiful church. Not crowded at all. Many young people were there drawing sketches of the mosaics and frescos. I think this is definitely worth seeing, but the inaccessibility is very much a problem. I cannot recommend taking the taxi's, even though sometimes it works out. If you are adventurous though, this is worth seeing!"

Get off when you reach the old city wall (which also adds to the trip). As at June 2015, part of church is closed off for renovation, but still worth 15TL. Best to get the bus back into the city.

The museum is under renovation and has scaffolding and boarding outside so you can't see the outside structure. The main chapel inside is also closed. However the outer halls of the chapel are still open and these contain most of the mosaics and frescos. From the guide books I read that there are very few mosaics in the main chapel other than the depiction of Mary's soul ascending to heaven. So it's still definitely worth visiting as what you can see is incredible and represent the best examples of surviving Byzantine art. You will see all manner if Christian themes depicted from judgement day to the resurrection. For me this was only second to Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Outside is a nice restaurant and also lots of shops selling associated souvenirs. There is also a small bookshop inside. Another tip is buy the museum pass as this attraction is included for free. As for getting there I didn't want to use a cab, so decided to use public transport. From Sultanahmet I took the tram towards Bagcilar and changed at Aksaray station onto the red airport metro line and went 2 stops to \"Topkapi - Ulubatli\". From there it's a pleasant 15 minute walk past remains of the old city walls so I suggest you download Ulmons \"CityMaps2Go\" app for your smartphone and get the offline Istanbul map (free). It uses GPRS so you don't pay any data charges. In fact I used it throughout my entire visit and found it both accurate and essential for getting around. In summary despite being off the tourist path and being under renovation it's still a must see site."

After numerous attempts to find an honest taxi driver in Istanbul (we were not successful in over 2 days as all 6 we tried to work with wanted over 5 times what they charge locals), we bought bus tickets and were sent on a bus to get to the site. Unfortunately, neither the person directing us to get on the bus or the driver must have understood as we were dropped off 20 minutes away and then had to ask about 10 people to get there. The return was easier. Take Bus 38E on the Eminomu station. If anyone finds an honest taxi driver in Istanbul, you should write down their name as they may get an award."

This is a bit misleading as it is outside the northern land walls and nowhere near the Topkapi Palace. From the station, and you can catch the tram at Kabatash on the coastline near the Besiktas area, you walk along the wall, over a dual carriageway- there are traffic lights but they only work night and early am, so use the subway!Tricky navigating will take you to the Chora Church. Built originally outside the city walls the Emperor Theodosius enclosed it when he had the walls rebuilt.The church carries little known stories of the Nativity and related aspects. When we visited some renovations were underway and main areas of the site were closed. You benefit from audio guides or you can buy a descriptive book.The mosaics are a marvel, go and see for yourself. The mosaics are of the quality of those that once adorned the inside of the Hagia Sophia."

All you could see were two small hallways in the shape of an L with the gift shop at its corner. The frescoes and mosaics that were visible are beautiful but that took all of 10 min to see. And be careful taking taxi getting there. Some take you the long way and pretend to not understand as your driving there.

Which is both good and bad, the bad being you'll probably come here on a guided tour so you may not get the time you want here and the good being that it will give you a sense of being in a different part of the city.Essentially the reasons for seeing this church are to see a piece of history, a very old church that had its mosaics covered over when the Ottoman Turks took Constantinople but which were later uncovered again when the church was turned into a museum.As per so many of these places there was restoration work going on at the time of my visit. It's par for the course. But what could be seen was still impressive and gave a sense of what the place must have been like all those centuries ago. The wear on the doorsteps and the sense of antiquity that hung over the building as a whole were enchanting.There is (of course) a tourist shop there and you can buy books and DVDs about this and other top sites in Istanbul as well as the more usual tourist tat. Also there is a market and a couple of places to grab a snack outside.One downside was the fact that you didn't seem to be able to get a shot of the whole building. Mainly due to everything being built up so close to the church itself. There was no sense of occasion walking up to it because you just walk down a laneway, past a restaurant and then you are suddenly there.All up a highly recommended opportunity to get out of the centre of old Istanbul though not exactly away from the tourist crowds!"

The accessible mosaics and small scale of this church/mosque are a nice counterpoint to the Hagia Sofia. The location is hard to get to, and we had our one negative experience of our trip when we were taken for a ride (literally and figuratively) when leaving from a cab that was waiting in the Sultanahmet area. The driver took us round and about, and through the really remote back streets surrounding the neighborhood and dropped us off at a back alley where we could see the site about 50 meters distant. We then had a verbal tussle over the amount of cash tendered. On the way home, we made our way to the main road -- about 200 m in other direction -- and flagged down a cab and made it back in half the time and half the fare."

Virtually all of the interior decor (sparkling mosaics and equally impressive al frescos) dates from 1312 and has endured five reconstructions. Like its big sister, it has been a church, a mosque and is now a beautifully preserved museum. A little out of the way but certainly well worth the effort and without the crowds or queues. Oh and while you're there, treat yourself to a dining experience like no other at the Ottoman inspired restaurant Asitane next door...my next review!"

The frescoes and mosaics are amazingly beautiful and largely intact, dates from 1312, and were funded by the wealthy Theodore Metochites. The mosaic above the door in the inner narthex shows Metochites offering the Church to Christ.The mosaics depict the stories of the lives of the Virgin Mary and Christ. Arm yourself with a good guidebook that describes the scenes and be prepared to be stunned by the beauty and intactness of the mosaics. After the mosaics, go look at the no less beautiful frescoes in the side chapel which was a burial chamber for Metochites and his family. The frescoes depict scenes from the resurrection (loved this one in particular, showing Christ breaking down the doors of hell and rescuing Adam and Eve from their tombs) and salvation, the Last Judgment and Entry into Paradise.Parts of it (Central Nave and Apse) were undergoing renovations when we visited in April this year, but the outer and inner narthex and the parekklesion (i.e. the side chapel) were open.

In addition to mosaics of biblical scriptural accounts, the mosaics tell less well know stories in mosaic form of the stories of Mary's birth, childhood, and life as told in the Apocrypha. We would never have seen and understood this without our guide, Sedar Donmez, who was wonderful at showing and explaining in great detail. An amazing sight! The Chora Church is definitely out of the way, but that makes it more interesting. It is out on the edge of the old city and the city wall is visible throughout the old neighborhood of small winding streets.

The mosaics are stunning.A few tips -- if you are going in the summer, bring a fan. It gets very hot in there -- bring a guide or a guidebook (we had Rick Steves). The mosaics are pictorial representations of many bible stories (particularly those of Mary and Christ), so it is helpful to know at what you are looking (and in what order to look). There are also a lot of bible characters and saints that you would not necessarily be able to place if you did not know who they are. -- go walk on the old city walls! If you head up Kariye Cami and take a right on Vaiz, you get to Hoca Chakir, which runs right along the old walls. If you then head left (aka with the wall to your right as you are walking), you will come to a staircase that will take you up onto the walls. If you are feeling adventurous, continue walking to a *second* staircase that offers you a higher view (accessed by a ladder-like staircase that looked more intimidating than it ended up being). Definitely an impressive view from either staircase, and there aren't many people up there, so you get to enjoy the experience alone or mostly alone (unlike most other places in the city)"

Even under construction it is very much worth the visit, the golden mosaics are not only nice to see, but also very interesting as they are telling a story throughout the church.A strong advice - get a map or clear directions before heading out to Chora, and learn the Turkish name for it (Kariye). If you're not familiar with the city, it's easy to get lost in that part of Istanbul, and since it's not in the touristic centre, the locals really try to be helpful, but mostly don't speak English at all."

They are gorgeous, even if you're not hugely into the whole Jesus thing. A fun game to play is seeing if you can recognize the scenes from the Bible without checking the guide. While you're in the area, avoid the pricey souvenirs in the plaza across from the church, but definitely stop by Asitane next door (life-changing!!) and (on the way from the bus/Metro) climb up the old land walls for a taste of Byzantium!"

In Istanbul there were temples to Artemis and Athena., They recognized the importance of women. When Constantine took over, the cult of women continued with the recognition of Mary, Mother of Jesus. This old church is covered with mosaics telling the story of Mary. While it is being restored, not all of the church can be viewed, but enough of it can be seen. It is stunning and lovely. The area around the church is also a lovely area. Sit, relax, drink some tea, and go for a walk."

We were able to see the mosaics in the two long hallways that lie just within the entry, and some frescos. The church lies on a small square with a caf\u00e9 and a few tourist shops. Toilets are in the caf\u00e9. From the church, a short walk uphill along the street next to the cafe ends at the massive city wall. There is a stairway without railings leading to a small area, again without railings, on top of the wall. Following the wall to your left for a short distance, one can walk through an entrance gate (now transected by a large roadway) to view the outside of the wall. The wall is impressive and worth a visit but the areas away from the gate are not particularly well maintained. When ready to return, one can flag down a yellow taxi for the trip back to the Old City. It will help to have your next stop written down to help the cab driver understand where you wish to go."

Artistically, the mosaics give important clues about the art perception of byzantium and the architecture of the building is also a mile stone in the byzantim history. The museum is walking distance to some other historical roman and osmanli sites. The district of museum itself a old jewish quartier. The jew who escaped from the brutality of europeans in medieval age did refuge into istanbul and they were given that place to settle. However, today there are no jews, instead there are conservative muslims. The district is safe but home to many islamic sects but it it is still nice to walk around and take street photos. Nowadays, the whole region is being replanned. Most of the buildings will be demolished or renewed and the rich turks will be replacing today's owners.

We actually got the bus ride at no charge, they were so willing to help, and when we got off, we thought the guy was going to walk us down, lol!The murals and tile work are all incredible here, with every nook and cranny having something to see. It can get quite crowded when the tours arrive, so if on your own try to plan for mid-afternoon. The area around the church is pretty un-touristy, and we walked back to the Grand Bazaar area from here, which was a hike, but a great experience. Recommended!"

As many others have stated here the Chora Church is well worth the visit even though the Nave is currently closed, the inner and outer narthexes plus the hall to the right of the entrance make the visit worthwhile. This will also give you a chance to walk through some residential streets of Istanbul that you might not normally encounter. We took the ferry from Eminonu, which was a scenic and quick way to arrive. The ferry stop is a little hard to find, walk past the bus depot to get to it. You can also ask anyone for the Avansary ferry. The ferry runs fairly frequently and you can use your Metro pass. Once you arrive at Avansary use a good street map to find the Chora, basically keep the land walls (also intersting) to your right as you walk up to the church. Watch the return ferry schedule, they run about an hour apart so time your visit to get back for the ferry, or do as we did and walk all the way back to Eminonu, it took us about an hour but was a fascinating look at Istanbul city life along the Golden Horn, many families barbecueing, families fishing, personal boats tied to the wharves,etc. Scenic walk and great exercise."

The Chora Church, as it stands today, is at least one thousand years old, but parts of the church apparently date back at least a further five hundred years. The church has had a long and chequered history, at one stage becoming a mosque, but now functions as a museum and has been largely restored. To get the full value from a visit, it is important to either join a group with a guide, or even better hire a personal guide (as we did). The reason for this is that the beautiful mosaics and frescoes on the walls and ceilings depict in chronological order the life and times of Jesus Christ, and without a guide it is difficult to follow. These are remarkably well-preserved mosaics with many being entirely original, and only a few having missing tiles. Flash photography is strictly forbidden and staff enforce this. One of the best ancient churches in Istanbul and strongly recommended."

But our friend Nathan took us to this smaller Church that has the most amazing mosaics telling the life stories of Mary and the prophets on ceilings as well as on the walls; also extensive frescoes, all of them in amazing good condition. Better still you are allowed to take pictures as long as you don't use the flash. There was much less waiting time than at the big tourist attractions. This is definitely one of the must see places and less expensive than the Blue Mosque or Hagia Sofia."

As the best preserved Byzantine Church in the area, the mosaics and frescoes devoted to Jesus and Mary are nothing short of breathtaking. And there are no crowds, meaning that you can take your time, listen to your audio guide (recommended), and absorb the artistry. While it is remote and requires a taxi ride, this is well worth the trip!"

It was worth getting the audio guide for 10 TL as well.Be sure to check out the wood houses on the way to the church, they represent an older classical wood style of row house.

As others have said, it's a bit difficult to find, but the neighbouring folks have probably heard requests for directions in many languages, and one shopkeeper helped us to find the Chora. We visited on a pleasant day on 6 Oct. 2014, and the site was fairly crowed.Once inside, there is a dazzling array of 700 year old mosaics and frescos, in amazing condition considering the various earthquakes and conversions (to mosques and museum) that this church has undergone over the centuries.One section was closed for renovations, but the remaining sections are still well worth the search to find it, and the nominal entry charge (TL 15). Highly recommended."

I haven't done the tram ride up, but this was such a nice break from the tourists I highly recommend going by water! We caught the ferry just north of the Galata Bridge (so pass all the guys advertising Bosphorus cruises). It was on the other side of a big parking lot for buses and such. Anyway, the boat was farly big and hardly anyone on it (much like the boat we took across to the Asian side) ... you can get your tea if you like. It stops a couple of times but you just stay on until you see the Ayvansaray dock. It's quite small but well posted with a big sign. We hoped off and walked through a big park/garden until we got to the Old Wall. We followed our nose in the general direction of the Church which is uphill through a residential area. The streets are narrow and there were even some neat dilapodated old Ottoman houses. Found a great view at one point and you could see all the way back to Topkapi! Sheep skins were drying on a fence and kids were playing in the cobbled streets ... this was real Istanbul. The church is under renovation so you can't get into the main part of the church. This is the oldest part. The parts you can go in are all around the outside, the narthax which was built by the Byzantines (I think it's 14th C) and so has the amazing mosaics you invision when thinking of Chora. From here, we walked up the hill further until we reached the Old Wall again. This was really great as we found a spot to climb and the view was amazing. The wall is REALLY HIGH! We also bought pomegranit juice from a vendour with a little outdoor cafe and wandered the outside of the wall as well. One of teh original gates is just across a main road, which has been blasted through the wall, so that was interesting to see as well. We walked back all along the base of the wall, passing some other restorations of an old prison and then back to the ferry. This was a great way to spend a few hours, highly recommend it!! I only gave Chora 4 stars because we couldn't see the actual inner church and we didn't realize that until after buying the tickets ... we were bummed. But still very happy to have seen the mosaics that we did! Buy e-tickets online before you go through the Muze ticketing site. Not the \"Museum Pass\", these are individual tickets that you buy and print out, although you pay the same price as if you purchased on site, you bypass the lineups. You also don't have a time frame to use them by like with the Museum Pass... no rushing! You can get them for Goreme Museum in Cappadocia, Ephesus and several others... they were well worth it!"

If the Hagia Sophia blows you away by it's sheer vastness, this church/mosque/museum will blow you away through the stunning Byzantine works of art lying within, that astonishingly survived a millennia. Though one of the hardest sights to visit in Istanbul (unless you are on a tour, which we were not), it is definitely an incredibly rewarding journey to take into the old, traditionally Greek western suburbs of Sultanahmet. This is truly one of the greatest examples of a Byzantine church in the whole of Europe with mosaics and frescos that will simply blow you away. The mosaic filled domes are the most astounding part of the church though it was also interesting to see the differences between the beautiful older byzantine art that tended to be frescoes (painted) and the later, more famous art that was applied through mosaic (small pieces of stone and tiles plastered on a wall). We took a taxi from the centre of Sultanahmet which proved to be relatively easy, but it took quite a while to find a taxi on the trip back. This is an incredibly interesting and beautiful site that should be visited by all."

My plan was to start with the further-out and far-flung sites of Istanbul before attacking all the popular sites in Sultanahmet so Kariye Museum was first on my long wish list of places to see in only two full days. I knew of the buses from Sultanahmet, but my hotel concierge warned me it would take an hour or more due to Istanbul's traffic and advised I take a taxi to save time. Good advice except my taxi driver was unfriendly and not upfront about the fare, but since my hotel told me the max I should pay, that's what I negotiated and presented. Arriving there, I was greeted by hawkers, scaffolding, restoration signs, tourists sitting at the adjacent cafe, and another unfriendly ticket lady. It's 15 TL per adult, unless you purchase the 85 TL Museum Pass, valid for 72 hours beginning from your first museum visit, and you get to bypass the lines waiting to buy tickets. Once inside, the mosaics & fresco are truly wonderful to behold and easier to view since Kariye was orginally a more intimate sized \"church in the country\". Once Times readers' underrated destinations of the world, now it's listed among the top 30 must-see museums in the world. Patricia Schultz, author of the book, \u201c1,000 Places to See Before You Die.\u201d ranks The Kariye Museum in Istanbul alongside such internationally celebrated art museums as The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Bilbao, Spain; The Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia; Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam; and The Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Make time to see it before they close the sections for restoration where most of the mosaics & frescoes will be closed from public view (estimated dates are Jan. 1, 2015 to Aug. 24, 2015). You will NOT be disappointed once you get past the hawkers, scaffolding, and restoration signs."

We were disappointed, but once inside realized that almost all of the mosaics and frescoes are outside of that part of the church - there is lots to see. Fantastic glittering mosaics on the ceilings, the walls, even down low were we could examine them quite closely. They are not pristine, but there is a surprising quantity of them. The church is a remarkable example of the Byzantine history of the city and worth a visit. We took the ferry up the Golden Horn and disembarked at Ayvansaray. We took a walk outlined in our Lonely Planet Istanbul book. The walk took us along the ancient city walls and was very hilly. The last bit were you turn for the church is not marked from this direction, which meant we blew past it and added considerably to our walk. It was all very interesting. But consider a bus or taxi for a more direct route!"

You have to work yourself harder if you, like me, are planning to reach this place not via roads but by the Golden Horn ferry(highly recommended). You need to get down at the Avyansaray pier and follow the Byzantine era walls lined right up the hill. This would take a good 20-25 mins to reach on foot but then you are treated with a very different and least touristy side of Istanbul. And the rewards for such a hardwork is just fantastic. Brilliant frescoes adorn the wall here depicting Biblical scenes. The audio guide is just brilliant. Strongly recommended to purchase one of these so that it helps you get a good idea of all the frescoes put up. Remember not to use the camera flash inside. I would rate this place higher than the Hagia Sophia for the sheer amount of intricate works that this Church houses. Most of them have been well kept. Plan to linger around for 2-3 hours to let this place grow on you.PS : Since this is a very old church, many of the rooms may not be accessible to the visitors on account of renovation works etc. It was such in my case at least. But whatever part is open for public views, do make it a point to visit this iconic place. These are the moments in your life that just take your breath away."

Make sure the meter is on!The paintings and artwork in the church are amazingly well preserved and the audio tour is so worth it and is relatively inexpensive, something like 15-20 TL I think, and it's offered in multiple languages, which is very nice. The artwork tells the story of Christ but actually starts a little with the story of Mary--the audio tour explains all of this. To walk through the entire church with the audio guide took maybe about 20 minutes. It's also apart of the museum pass kart, so that was nice as there was no added expense charged to us, we just flashed the card and we were let in. I think because this place is a little further out, this explained why it was not crammed with tourists, the church is fairly small but seemingly bigger than the Blue Mosque and there's a cute little gift store in the corner that sells some nice memorabilia."

Byzantine treasures in a city owned by Muslims for hundreds of years that survive do so by a combination of luck and tolerance and accident and so it is here. The final (?) phase is their restoration in our present transitory position of tolerance and respect in a currently stable secular society but, in how many years might none of those helpful conditions remain? Go now! For me, with an excellent and scholarly guide, it was a revelation to learn of the suppressed history of Christianity and to see the hidden history revealed on the fabric of this building in mosaic and fresco. The word used often was 'apocryphal' and there the clue is 'The Apocrypha', defined as writings of dubious value' therefore excluded from the Bible. Without wishing to ruffle feathers and leaving it to you to decide for yourself what written word you consider as fact or fiction or legend or any word you choose, just go and see this as sublime ancient art inspired by belief."

We took the T1 tramline from Sultanahmet as far as Topkapi. At Topkapi we followed the signs to the T4 tramline and took the tram as far as Edirnekape. At Edirnekapi we walked across the road to the city wall and, turned left keeping the city wall on our left. We used the map in our guidebook and a bit of common sense to determine when to turn right to the church but for greater accuracy you can check out street names on Google maps. The walk to the church took about 10 minutes. You will need four tram tokens per individual to get there and back from Sultanahmet. At the church, we hired an audio guide which helped to a certain extent but also confused us a couple of times when we couldn't find the mosaics to which the audio was referring!"

            "review": "Disappointing conditions and under restoration. First, I have something against a religious site being called a museum. It is a church and not a museum. Otherwise, all historic churches and mosques in Europe should be called museums. This just to show you how disrespectful the authorities are to non-muslim sites in the city and their unwillingness to acknowledge the historic significance of this church. In this day and age, this kind of revisionism is in my view unacceptable. Second, as fantastic as this site is (as seen by the numerous rather useless reviews for this site) it could be a lot better. The inside in the summer is humid and hot with no ventilation which makes the experience rather uncomfortable, not considering the damage that these conditions can cause to the artifacts in the church (no wonder they're restoring it). There are a lack of descriptions for any of the church or mosaics (yeah, some of us don't want to dish out the extra dough for the audio guide). Third, the ticket office did not make it clear to us that the main part of the church was under renovation. I wouldn't have gone. What's the point of seeing the minor parts if you can't see the main nave of the church. It's not even mentioned predominantly on the main website. I wouldn't have gone if this was the case and waited till the restoration was completed to see the entire structure as it's supposed to be seen. All in all, I felt that a place of such historic significance should've been treated with more respect and care. As in the few other remaining Byzantine relics that remain in Istanbul (and there are very few) one gets the sense that it's more there to make money rather than preserve historic and cultural identity."

The Kariye museum = the church of Jesus Christ the Savior in Chora (= in the country, outside the Constantinean walls of the fortified city), is a bit out of the way but well worth the effort. The most convenient way to get here is by the number 4 tram (connect to it at the Topkapi station, where you can switch from the Number 1 tram from Sultanahmet). For me, this is the most unforgettable sight in Istanbul. Never (not in Ravenna, Sicily, even Haghia Sophia) have I seen mosaics with such subtlety, so nuanced, so three-dimensional. Breathtaking. The best features of Renaissance painting, in mosaic art of incredibly delicacy and elegance. The frescoes are also impressive, also have that three-dimensional quality. The artists have made use of architectural features in a very sophisticated way. DO NOT MISS THIS GEM!"

I was with a local guide whose knowledge of the biblical images was prodigious. If pays to let the larger tour groups pass so you can view the images at length and in peace! Located inside is the obligatory tourist shop and across the road are some great tea shops.

We took the Big Bus blue tour, and got off at the 2nd stop from Sultanahmet, at a waterside park. Using the GPS on our iTouch we navigated our way up the steep hills for 30 minutes through local neighbourhoods - past schools, churches, mosques, children playing, women shopping, men lounging or working, graveyards, colourful, tall, woodframe homes, and abandoned buildings - where we were the only tourists - and this is high season. We took the road less travelled to the Chora and the more direct downhill route back (saw other tourists on return trek). Both were wonderful. Smiles and \"merhabahs\" go a long way with locals. The children were engaging and some happy to practice their English on you \"My name is ---, where are you from?\"The Chora itself was stunning. Even though the main part of the church was closed for restoration, the balance was breath-taking. Not crowded and very intimate space. We were glad we rented the headset (tip: bring a splitter and share a headset) as each scene in mosaic, as well as the history and significance of the place, was described in appropriate detail. Recordings were about 30 minutes in total. We saw a couple people with guides, but perhaps counter intuitively, preferred the headsets for flexibility and maneuverability.We had tea at the little restaurant just opposite the Chora. Lovely setting, nice place to relax. But the service was dreadfully uneven, and despite the number of waiters, many guests were frustrated. I would not recommend against it, but reserves of patience and equanimity may be required."

This little church was built in byzantine period, with the conquest of \u0130stanbul It was converted to a mosque like Hagia Sophia. Chora has a world wide reputation with its mosaics and marbles. Unfortunately marble section is closed due to renovation works. But you are still able to see wonderful mosaics works. Mosaics has a chronical order. They first began to tell life of Mother Mary, how did she born, how did she marry and how did she give birth to Jesus. At the exterior narthex, life of Jesus was explicated. It is better to visit museum with a guide, it is a small museum but there is too much to understand and see. Entrance fee is 30 TL, during the summer time you can visit the museum till 19.00 but last entrance is at 18.00. And please note that; it is not easy to find museum, due to location of Chora. I suggest you to take \"metrob\u00fcs\", get off at \"Ayvansaray\" station than take a cab. If you are able to use your GPRS It would be nice walk at the area."

Everywhere you look, the church is filled with the most stunning examples of mosaic and fresco work. Seriously, your neck will hurt by the end of the visit because you will be entranced by the beautiful, artistic work. The church is undergoing a major restoration, so the main sanctuary was closed when we visited (June 2014), but worth a visit regardless, as the two narthexes and side chapels are simply stunning. Be advised - it's not the easiest place to get to. We took the tram from Sultanahmet and it required a transfer plus a little walk (which is pretty uphill on the way back). The area it's in is the antithesis of touristy, which my boyfriend and I actually enjoyed. Also, right off the main road on your way to the church, there is a strip of restaurants with great, simple lunch food, including doner kebabs prepared by gentlemen who look like they have been practicing their craft for years. While they didn't speak English, they were so patient with my butchered Turkish and were some of the most hospitable and gracious people I encountered on my trip!"

The audio guide was also 15TLR, which we found a bit out of proportions, as we are a family of 4, we didn\u2019t do this. Also the a part of the church was closed for restauration, still worthwhile. By the way, it\u2019s very small.You can combine with the ancient city wall and if you like Kariy you should also see the Fethiye museum (mosaic), This is an old church, similar to the Kariye, but most of it is now a mosque, however they preserved a small part as a museum. It\u2019s really small, but beautiful fresco\u2019s. They also have a small garden where you can sit and relax. Very peaceful, very old (some of it 3000 BC). 15 minute walk from Kariye."

Because of the smaller scale and cosiness of the church (in comparison to Ay. Sofia), the mosaics and frescoes are closer to you, so its easier to appreciate and admire the details. The level of detail, the technique used, the colours of the mosaics and frescoes are stunning, especially considering their age! Believe what you hear - they are the finest examples of Byzantine Christian mosaic. The Resurrection fresco is supposedly the most beautiful depiction in the christian world . It is tucked away off the main tourist areas but don't be put off! You'll regret it. If you intend to visit Ay. Sofia, Topkapi Palace and Chora Church I would recommend buying the museum pass - it saves time!"

There was something very quiet and peaceful about it. We took photos of the posters outside instead and we were surprised how well they came out. The paintings in the domes are amazing, as are the wall paintings and mosaics.Would recommend."

Also, the tesserae were set at slight angles to the wall, so that they caught the light in different ways. Note: no grout between the tiles. Why is \"The Anastasis\" fresco (Christ liberating Adam and Eve) so significant?

It's better to have a guide book with a map of the illustrations, which is easier to follow. Be prepared for neck pain, the mosaics/fresco are all high. You can take a taxi but it can be a wild ride. We went by tram to Topkapi, and then light rail to Edirnekapi (maybe 40 mins). You need to walk under the wall. It's a left turn on Savaklar Cd, crossing road at traffic lights. You then follow Fevzi Pasa Cd until you can cross it, and look for signs for a left turn to Kariye. If you reach a soccer stadium you've gone too far. Download Google maps before you take the tram, and it's easy. There is an outdoor restaurant right beside the church, and a nice one (Asitane) close by. The walls are less than a 5 min walk, and definitely worth climbing. Walk back to a main road before taking a taxi (the nearer ones are waiting for unprepared tourists). We went late (about 3.00 pm) and the crowds were low. Most of the cruise trips are probably done by then."

Turkish Orthodoxy teaches that St. John accompanied the virgin Mary to Turkey after Jesus died, and she remained in Turkey the rest of her life. The mosaics depict many wonderful stories about Mary and the holy family that I have never heard. I really think this is my favorite historic spot in Istanbul. Our tour guide lost his voice explaining the meaning and the stories behind all the mosaics. A bit crowded. Definitely see this church with a guide, although a self-guided tour may be available at the church."

Visiting the Chora Church in Istanbul is a remarkable experience - and a step back into history when the church used beautiful depictions of the life of the virgin Mary and Christ to encourage and instruct its members. The walls and ceilings are full of beautiful mosaics and paintings - whose artistry and use of color, scenery and story convey the importance of the events they depict to any viewer. The large number of well preserved and/or artfully restored works are easily viewable and give the viewer much to marvel at in the relatively small and compact space. I highly recommend visitors putting this high on their agenda in Istanbul."

Even though the size of Kariye Museum (The Chora Church) is not very big but it contains a lot of amazing mosaics all over the ceiling and walls illustrating scenes from the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary. It is one of the oldest churches dating back to the 11th-century. When you are done, there is a small cafe outside the Church that serves fast food, but my recommendation for a good meal is to go to Asitane Restaurant which is near the entrance to the church. The Church can be easily reached from Sulanahmet by public transportation. Take the tram to Topkapi, the light rail to Edirnekapi, then a short walk. It is open from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm; Admission 15 TL (included in Museum pass). It is closed on Wednesday. Enjoy it."

This church sits in the outermost western area of Fatih, so I'd suggest cabbing it if you are staying in Sulthanamet - It's not really close to much ... but it's time on a plane train or in an automobile is way more than worth it!Little history lesson here: The original church was built in the 5th century, and it used to be outside the walls of Constantinople (now Istanbul) - who knows when Constantine the Great reigned? Very good - up to 337. When Theodosius II built his walls in 414, the church was included just inside the walls. So, my point here is that what's really great about the location is that you can see the famed Theodosian Walls if you visit - they are just up the street (2-birds-with-1-stone kinda thing). They're way cool!Chora Church, much like the many churches turned mosques in this area, had fallen to acts of the Iconoclasm (just in case: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ic\u2026), and many of the frescoes and mosaics were covered with plaster. It's a shame because restoring them has taken their toll. I would have to say, however, that of all the places we visited in Turkey, the art in Chora Church was the most plentiful and best kept, making this site not to be missed. Walking through this church is a history lesson in itself - The Nativity, the journey of the Magi, the flight into Egypt, the Second coming of Christ, the Resurrection, the many saints, Christ the Pantocrator and the account of the life of the Virgin Mary, are among the many mosaics and frescoes in the Church. In contrast to visiting the Hagia Sophia and other sites in Istanbul, the staff is pretty relaxed at Chora - they don't want you snapping flash fueled photos, but there is lots of light, which allows you to get some great pics if you know how to play with that natural light. The grounds are beautiful as well - spend some time in the garden if you are there in Spring (bit.ly/12vAOAf). While they have the audio tours available for rent, I did not take part in that, so I can't comment on the value and validity, however, I did hear others stating that the audio tours at Chora were worth it. Istanbul itself is pretty hilly, and Chora Church sits up high. If you have the opportunity, the right shoes, and the weather is nice, take the walk back DOWN into town when you are done. The views are amazing."

The church is easily reached by cab, bus or a ferry and short walk. Treat yourself to lunch at Asitane located next door and you have an afternoon filled with Ottoman and Byzantine history.

However, if you have seen Hagiya Sophia, and like the mosaics discovered there, you MUST visit this place, as it contains fully preserved mosaics with an unbelievably detailed execution, which makes it almost look like it's a painting.Unfortunately, when we visited the place, the main halls of the church were under renovation, which limited our experience to only two rooms, but which had almost 100% preserved mosaics on the ceiling and upper parts of the walls. Not too much in quantity, but truly awe inspiringI must commend my husband for finding the best approach to this place. Being away from most other attractions, getting here can be tricky. We chose to go to the Edirnekapi station (with metro/tram number T4, also displayed as metro/tram number 64) and with the help of a GPS application, we got to the church in barely any time, with mostly downhill walk. From the church we went (downhill again) to the ferry station Ayvansaray. From here we took the ferry (which works with your Istanbulcard) back to Emin\u00f6n\u00fc."

I had read about this church and its significance in the European history, so I made sure we visit it when we were in Istanbul in January 2012. We had to take a taxi to the church because it is located outside the ancient city wall of Istanbul, a little out of the way of the mainstay tourist district. But the special trip is totally worth it. I was a little confused when the taxi dropped us off at the gate with a sign that says Kariye Museum because I did not know that that was its name in Turkish. Only a small group of visitors was allowed to enter the church at each time slot. The minute I stepped inside I knew exactly why. It is such a beautiful little church that one can appeciate only with slow, measured steps. Why? Because your eyes will be glued to the ceilings and upper parts of the walls since the lower parts were completely destroyed a long time ago by the crusaders. Would we be as dazzled by the sight had the remaining parts of the interiors remained intact? One would never know. After visiting the church, we wandered through the neighborhood toward to ancient city wall. It was a lovely feeling because we enjoyed peering into doorways, admiring the different wall decorations, saying hello to fellow foreign travelers and talking to a group of young Turkish travellers. We finally came across a bird market that was being held inside the ancient city wall! Love it, love it, love it.Don't miss the Kariye Museum and its neighborhood when you are in Istanbul."

The church and mosaics were really neat to see but even taking my time to look at a lot of things closely it was really only a 15-20 minute visit which made the 15TL entrance fee seem kind of steep. May have been worth it to get the audio guide but was budgeting my final liras for the trip.I probably wouldn't have gone had I realized it was gonna be so brief but it was still ok to see. If you're on the fence about it, pinching pennies or tight on time I feel like you could skip it and not feel like you missed out. However, if you have the Museum Pass or are sure you want to go then go, it was really interesting to look around but was just a little smallish for the price to me."

Those that were awed by the light and space but ever so slightly underwhelmed by the mosaics in the Aya Sophia should head out north west to the lesser known Kariye Museum. Housed in a former Byzantine church, it was converted (like all the others) into a mosque after the Ottoman invasion. It is hard to believe that the Ottomans would want to whitewash the place, as it really is a stunner: The beautiful, fragmenting mosaics and fading frescoes retain much of their detail despite years of neglect. Recent posts have told of the museum being closed, this is not true, only the nave is closed, and honestly all the best stuff is in the outer and inner narthexes. I also recommend wandering through Fatih, an area where few tourists venture, to the Fethiye Museum for a small, but interesting Byzantine delight.Getting there: you could take a taxi, but its unneccessary - bus from Eminounou is quick and cheap, details on this page http://www.choramuseum.com/transportation/"

Just watch for the 'Halic Iskelesi' (Golden Horn Pier). You can pay for the water bus with the Istanbulkart.Get off at the Ayvansaray station, then walk to the city walls (clearly visible) and keep following them.This is a rather poor neighbourhood. We did not feel threatened but I do not recommend t walk here at night.The route along the ancient walls of Theodosius is an attraction in itself. Just keep in mind that these fortifications were built in the 5th century and protected the city for ages.It still is not that easy to find the Chora church. We had to use the 'maps of Turkey' app on our smartphone and eventually we made it.We returned to the old town by taking a buss from nearby Edirnekapi."

For those with a GENUINE interest in Byzantine mosaics and frescoes - as opposed to those who are simply looking for more pretty things to snap on their iPhones - this place is the real deal. The mosaics in Aya Sofia pale into insignificance compared to those in the Chora Church. Yes, part of the museum is currently closed for renovation (that happens in really old places - it isn't Disneyland folks) but don't let that put you off; I hope you will be overwhelmed by the glorious vibrancy of the artistic works created well over 1000 years ago. Oh, and a bonus, you won't need to queue for long if at all - your package tourist isn't likely to come here.Now, as to getting there. Catch a taxi if you will - but why not try it by bus? It takes longer but I like to think of the journey as part of the experience. Sorry, I can't remember the bus number but the Lonely Planet has it."

Let me start by saying that by the time I was 10 years old I had visited many of the great churches of Europe, my parents were able to travel and take the family along. So we went to museums and churches in England, France, Italy (including the Vatican), Greece and much of Israel and the holy land. So maybe I expected more...Even though we were staying north of the Golden Horn at the Hilton ParkSA my wife and I were like ancient explorers in the New World as we traveled by cable car tram to get to Taksim and then the funicular to Kabatis. From there by road tram to Topkapi and then a metro rail train to Edirnekapi! We threw caution to the wind and risked our lives crossing several busy roads with taxis and buses determined to mow us down. Then, using my hand drawn map because the one I purchased assumed this church was past the edge of the rim of the planet, and my compass and daring navigational skills my wife and I found the chuch!Thanks be to God we proclaimed and knelt in prayer and tribute. We then paid the 30 TL for 2 tickets which we assumed was to pay for the quality frescoes and mosaics all the restoration. We entered and within 10 minutes discovered that this was not the Holy Grail we were seeking! Satin had fooled us and led us here and into the church without telling us that it was being renovated and only 2 hallways were open. We checked out the gift shop only discover they had little we wanted and many over priced and tacky items. Sadly, we left and realized we had wasted 30TL that could have been spent on items at the gift shop outside! I feel sory for anyone who paid a high taxi fare or wasted money on the audio guide! Don't waste your time, it is not the grail you seek!"

Although we got to Chora by 09.30 (taxi), already a number of tour bus groups had arrived and crowded into the small space of the church (now museum). The mosaics and frescoes are indeed spectacular but the experience is reduced because of the large number of people in the small space. It should be noted that the nave of the church is closed for restoration, and we could not establish when it might reopen. As we travelled independently, we were able to walk a short way from the church to see the old city walls (spectacular size) and these made up for the crowds and closure at the church. We noted that the lines were none-existent when we returned from the walls at around 11.30am \u2013 maybe the tour buses all get there as the first stop of the day. Worth a visit, but best to try and avoid the lines with the earliest arrival you can make, or later in the day.If you have been to Ravenna (to which Chora is compared) than my overall impression is that Ravenna is more extensive \u2013 although again noisy and crowded, as Chora."

We took public transport out to it, via the metro and the tram...and after a brief walk discovered the very unassuming church nestled into the hillside.As we had visited other sites in the morning, we arrived in the middle of the peak American tourist rush, which was a bit of a pain, as we had to constantly move out of the way of herds of braying people who didn't seem to appreciate they were a) in a church and b) not the only people there. On the plus side, however, it did allow us to piggy back on their guides' information, but my recommendation would be to go early and avoid the noise - it must be hideous in the summer.The central area of the church was being renovated when we visited, but as the mosaics and frescoes tend to be in the chapels and passages around the central zone, this wasn't a problem. The colours and levels of preservation were extraordinary, and took my breath away.On the way back into town we walked back to take the tram as recommended by Lonely Planet - this was a MUCH longer route, but did allow us to see much more of Istanbul life, passing through a residential area - I'd suggest getting the metro/tram route sorted, as it's much closer.Definitely a must see - but go early in the day."

The main section of the church is still closed off for the public, but what you can visit is a rewarding and enriching experience. There is much to look at, read and reflect on. The 'Chora museum' as it is called takes its name (chora) from its situation outside the centre (chora is Greek for country/countryside) of the medieval city of Constantinople. When asking for directions, the locals refer to it typically as Kariye mosque as a mosque was constructed adjacent to it."

Take the T1 to Topkapi then up a few stairs to the T4 to Edirnekapi. A quick look at a map and it is then less than 10 minutes away on foot.

The place is a bit far 10-15 minutes without traffic. The taxi ride from the White House hotel cost us 30 lira. Good thing that cruise mates George and Bobbie shared the fare.A guide at our hotel told us to purchase a small book in order to understand the meaning of the mosaics on the ceiling of the church. The church is small but the ceilings have so many mosaics and frescos that are more fascinating than the ones found at the huge Ayasofya. Done in the 14th century, the frescos are well preserved even if the church was converted into a mosque when the Muslims took over.The mosaics and frescoes are a virtual storybook of the life of Jesus and Mary- from the nativity to the last judgment. Having said that, somebody needs to do a video documentary with commentary of this museum. Probably, like the video shown at the ayasofya. The area of the church is small and tourists would inevitably suffer from stiff necks from looking up while listening to your tour guide or consulting a guide book. This is not an easy task specially if there is a big tour group in the church."

It is listed as one of the must see\u2019s on any attraction list in Istanbul. Second time round in Istanbul I made sure that I made time to visit this beautiful Church.Kariye is the Turkish version of Chora, which was the Greek word for \u201ccountryside.\u201d . The magnificent Chora Museum is an old Byzantine church, situated just inside the city walls at Edirnekap\u0131 and is known for its beautiful frescos and mosaics. I have to admit it is a bit off the routine tourist path. The feature of this amazing Church is the mosaics and frescoes. If you are history lover this is the place for you, so take time to appreciate and gaze at the beautiful mosaics and frescos. Pics are allowed remember NO flash .Audio guides are available at an additional charge just near the entrance. The area surrounding this Church is quaint and you may sit around for a while and have a cup of Chy/ Khave , people watch, observe or even explore the side streets. A few steps away you will see a small beautiful tomb, which you are allowed to enter ( please keep in mind local customs when entering)To get to Chora Museum Take bus #\u2019s 28 or 36KE from Eminonu or bus # 87 from Taksim ( TIP \u2013 get the Istanbul kart \u2013 available at cafes and kiosks ) . A taxi ride from Taksim should cost between 10 and 15 YTL. ( in the same region if travelling from the Sultanahmet area)"

Though currently undergoing renovation the audio guide still provided a great tour and I saw the most amazing frescos and a building that showcases rich history. I took the ferry then walked up the old wall and it was easy to find. Take a map and you will enjoy the time. Then I wandered on to find the tram back. It was a bit of a hike but well worth it and the outdoor restaurants at the complex offered good food and refreshment."

The museum was very small (there was some renovation going on), but the parts we saw were gorgeous. The mosaic is really well preserved and so intricate. Also, if you plan on getting any Isnik tiles while in istanbul, get them at the vendors outside the Chora. There are 2, and the designs are similar (the same prlly) as the Grand bazaar, but the prices are much better (5-8 TL/tile item).

It is believed to be one of the first Christian churches as Christianity was outlawed until shortly before it was built. They restored it beautifully and it's just a delight to follow the story of Jesus, Mary and Joseph as they saw it so many centuries ago. One panel that impressed me showed the duality in Christ -- one side of his face is young and peaceful, the other older, stern. The god of love vs the god of judgement? It was striking."

They tell the Christian story in vivid and beautiful detail. You need a guidebook to list the subjects depicted - the Lonely Planet guide has this on its last pages. The most powerful image is that of the Anastasis or Resurrection, a fresco in the side chapel, which brings Stanley Spencer to mind. Well worth the walk up. The Museum is included in the Museum card scheme: cost TL15. It is best to go at 9am or at lunchtime when the tour groups have gone to eat, otherwise it can be very crowded. The Pink Cafe opposite is good value, and afterwards you can walk along the Theodosian city walls and see the ruins of Constantine's palace."

By the word exeptional I mean that nowhere in the world will you find 14th century mosaics of such outstanding quality and as completely preserved. Before getting there I strongly recommend to read some books or at least Wikipedia articles on byzantine art to fully apreciate this magnificent relic of lost and forgotten splendour."

The affect of the pictures is very strong. The decorative use of marble is also of great beauty. It is a pity that there is no proper lighting design. On the contrary it seems like a local electrician has put whatever light bulbs were handy- even plain terrible economy ones- in a monument of such importance. This greatly alters the architectural sense of the space and in some cases makes it difficult to see the mosaics ('burnt' images, shadows due to uneveness of the mosaics, wrong way up shadows from architectural elements). At least, the room devoted to the mother is ok. This is a interesting example of a pack of wrong choices and alterations on how to present a great historical monument. You enter from the side door, while a shop is located in the originally main entrance of the monument and you diy the lights. Still, the monument is overwelming."

We found it best to take a taxi to see it, agreed with taxi drivers both ways in advance to take us from downtown Istanbul to the church and back for 25TL ($12 .50) each way. To have taken the tramway, then bus (at 3 TL each person each form of transportation) and then walk a bit was not worth the time or money.

However there is nothing else to expect - It's a very old small church with truly good kept mosaics that I understand were covered in plaster after the fall of Constantinopol and thus very nicely preserved until they were revealed from under the plaster-. The mosaics are some of the most beautiful, but since I'm not a religious person and not a big fan of byzantine church art, for me it felt like it did not rise to the hype. On the other hand I do realize many people are religious and will feel much moved by the depictions and mosaics might be of much more interest to them.Thus the conclusion rests on which side are you. I've attached some shots of the mosaics I took to help you decide for yourself."

A part of the tours on our \"Voyages to Antiquity\" trip with Smithsonian Journeys puts this (in my opinion) as the most intimate and memorable tour and number one on my list of favorites. This crumbling (but intact) structure dates from about 1100 B.C. as we see it today. Original construction is dated at 4th century B.C. The construction is a whole other category of discussion.The intimacy of this small church, the absolute beauty of the gold toned ultra-mini-small pieces of mosiacs depicting such fantastic pictures of what Mary's early life (think age 9) was like, and her father's process of picking Mary's husband-to-be. OMG, this was a fantastic experience. And then the Gospel according to James the Lesser (you won't find him in the present bible, he was edited out). So many exceptional expressions of life and possible happenings in so distant a part of history.And then, as in most of Turkey, the keys to the building were handed over to the Turks circa the 16th century, and the mosaics were plastered over (stop me if you've heard this one before) and then uncovered at a later point in history.It's a very heady, spiritual experience to gaze upon these mosaics and the story they tell. And the story told is moving, truly spiritual, and oh-so thought provoking. I will remember it forever. "

When you go, watch people as they enter the church because they all more or less do the same thing: they step over the threshold, look ahead to the niche in the blank brick wall ahead of them, and then they glace to the space opening up on their right. And they gasp.They gasp because they're looking down a side chapel covered from floor to ceiling in frescoes where in the apse at the end, is one of the finest paintings in the world. The effect is heart-stopping.The building isn't very large, and it's divided into four separate spaces which makes it seems even smaller. The largest of these, the main church, is rather bare, but the other three, which serve as side chapels and entrance halls to the church, are covered with dazzling mosaics and brightly coloured frescoes drawn with exquisite sensitivity. The mosaics and frescoes are laid out to give the viewer a theological story, and I found it greatly increased my understanding and enjoyment to use a guide book that help me unravel what I was seeing. I saw a lot of other visitors were doing the same thing. Some were using the audio guides that you can rent for 10TL just outside the building. I didn't do this, so I can't comment on how good they are. Don't let this put you off, though, if this kind of reading up isn't for you, you can still enjoy the astonishing quality of the art, and feel the impact it has. In fact, a visit to Chora is a great help when it comes to understanding any of the other Byzantine churches in the city, especially Haghia Sophia. Come here first and it will be much easier to reconstruct how these others must have looked before the conquest.Some practical tips: there are toilets (on the way in). There are some nice, if expensive, places to stop for a bite or a drink in and around the delightful square outside, where you'll also find people selling icons, trinkets and other tourist ware.Getting here by public transport isn't very hard. Probably the easiest way is by tram (T1) to Topkap\u0131 (not Metro stop, not the palace!) and then the T4 three stop to Edirnekap\u0131. When you get off, follow the city walls for about 100 yards, keeping them on your left and you will find the church down a side street on your right. If you need directions, ask people for \"Kariye\" and someone will point you where to go."

If you do go take the tram to Yusufpasa then the metro from Aksaray to Topkapi Ulubatli. From here it's a 20-30 minute walk along the old city walls to the church. Ladies be aware that you are walking through the more suburban areas of Istanbul and conservative clothing is advisable. The church itself is very pretty and some of the mosaics are spectacular but at 15TL each (the same price as the Topkapi Harem) it's a bit steep."

After exiting the Metro you're by a highway, so I asked a few locals to help me with directions when Google maps failed. It was about another 10 minute walk. I am a female travelling alone and never felt unsafe. Souveniers here are also cheaper than in Sultanahmet.Once you arrive at the church and pay 15TL you will immediately be taken by it's smaller scale charm. It is not a hulking mosque but a rather quaint little brick church w/ breathtaking mosaics. Most of the other sites in Istanbul will be iznik tiles or frescoes. This is beautiful, lustrous, fine detailed mosaics. They are also extremely well-preserved for the most part especially on the ceilings, so take your time looking up and follow the biblical stories."

I do agree that the way that the lighting is set up with steel gridwork overhead does take away from the actual structure at times. There are areas that are lost from restoration due to earthquakes but interesting to see. Along with the mosaics and frescos, keep on eye out for the beautiful marble striations. There is also a gift shop and cafe on site. A great way to spend a couple of hours."

The former church, then mosque has one of the most vivid and well perserved Byzantine mosaics in the world. The wall and ceiling paintings literally jump out at you. Unfortunately many of them were partially damaged when the church was converted to a mosque in the 15th century, but they have been able to uncover an impressive portion of the original mosaics and frescoes.The Kariye Museum is a little off the beaten track as it is out near the Theodosian walls so many people don't venture there when they visit Istanbul. It certainly is worth the cab or bus ride if you have the opportunity. The walls as well are worth seeing (they are just up the hill from the museum) and you can actually climb to the top and get a good view of Istanbul."

Although the architecture isn't as breathtaking as Aya Sofya, the artwork makes Kariye Museum a must-see for lovers of mosaics or religious art.The area around the church is fun to explore as well, just a stone's throw from the city walls. To make a day of it you could follow the wall east a little ways, then make your way down to explore the neighborhood of Balat, followed by a walk along the Golden Horn back towards Taksim or Eminonu."

Sure, the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia have the jaw-dropping magnitude and location location location, but this little church further afield in the Sultanahmet is easier to consider in perspective, and will quickly become a permanent memory of Istanbul.The draw is the mosaics, which are slowly being restored, and the frescoes. It is easy to imagine what the interior must have looked like in its original state, covered in tiniest of mosaic tiles, so carefully designed and laid. Curators have done a nice job of \"partially completing\" many of the mosaics so that you get a sense of the work involved. The easiest way to get to the Kariye is via taxi. It'll cost about 20 TL (8 Euros). For a tenth of that cost you can take a bus from the Eminonu ferry stop in town, and get off at Edirnekapi. We walked from the Blue Mosque, it took about an hour.Bonus: When you leave the church, wander the surrounding neighborhood -- there are plenty of the old-school Istanbul wooden houses, many restored and many abandoned. You can easily walk the residential neighborhoods downhill until you get to the water and then easily catch a bus or cab back, or just walk the boardwalk back to the Gallata. Makes the trip out there even that much more worthwhile."

Still surrounded by a busy community, from the back lot one sees the imperial center crowning the hills in the distance, and can get more of a feeling what life was like for ordinary citizens living during the bulk of the Christian period. The story of the church's founding is itself an interesting glimpse into the workings of the Empire, while the intimate and moving mosaics are among the best examples of their kind. The light modifications made during its period as a mosque preserved, rather than destroyed the beauty of these richly decorated spaces. I've been drawn back to see them time and again and would not consider a trip to Istanbul complete without another visit."

Usually people go for the most popular historical sites \u2013 Haghia Sophia, Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque, and The Cora Church easily could be missed. It is included in the Museum Pass Istanbul for 72 hours which costs 72 TL with a single entry to 9 museums - Haghia Sophia, Topkapi Palace plus the Harem Apartments, Archaeological Museum, Mosaics Museum, Museum for the history of Science & Technology in Islam and Museum of Islam Arts. When using this card, bear in mind that The Cora Church is closed on Wednesdays.The church is a bit far from the main attractions but is still very reachable. To get to the church we took a taxi from Sultanahmet which cost 25TL and we asked the taxi driver for the price in advance so that we avoided some unpleasant surprises when it came time for payment. The journey was about 20 minutes and it was also an excellent way to see the walls that ringed old Constantinople. All images from the mosaics and frescoes are amazing and it is difficult to have a favourite here. They also are very unusual such as the one with the Virgin Mary with the little Christ in her tummy, or seeing Christ dragging Adam and Eve out of their tombs. Notice that all works are from almost exactly the same date as the work of Giotto in Italy, and as one of the guide books says, they have the same spirit of life and reality, so typical of the dawn of the Renaissance. The audio guide (10TL) was quite good. The artists of this church were storytellers; there are amazing stories to follow around and it is important to have an audio guide with you. To me personally, the story of the childhood of Virgin Mary as well as her parents, Anne and Joachim, is the most beautiful story here. The mosaics with the motives of The Virgin first seven steps as well as the Virgin caressed by her parents are fascinating: these images of the three of them as a family are superb and can hardly be seen in other churches\u2019 walls."

All you need to do is get used to the train/ metro system. We managed to go to this gem as part of our 3 and a half day stay in Istanbul. Second thing.... I don't think that you need to be an art lover to love this gem! The mosaic work, the restoration and the overall atmosphere humbles you.Third... get the museum passHow did we get there? 1. We took the tram from Karakoy to Topkapi (note: this is not the Topkapi palace, but the Topkapi neighborhood/ station, which is 6-7 stops after Sultanahmet/ Topkapi). 2. We then took the metro from Topkapi to Edirnekapi. This is the neighborhood where the Chora Church is located.3. After this it was a 10 minute walk along the walls to get to the Chora Church. Our \"offline\" map let us down...but a kind lady took us right to the lane that leads to the museum. Also remember, the locals know this as the Kariye Museum.Inside: The museum wasn't too crowded.. which turned out to be good for us. We bought the audio tour guide; again, very impressed with the content. The mosaics are beautifully maintained - keep in mind, the first construction happened during early 5th century. We spent around 2.5 hours there. The highlight for me was the series called \"the life of Mary\".Outside: There are a couple of restaurants outside the museum. We did not go to the highly rated Asitane, instead went to the open-air restaurant outside the exit of the museum (Pembe Kosk). There are the typical tourist traps...shops that sell \"genuine Turkish souvenirs\" (made in China) at ridiculous prices. There was a watercolor artist outside who had some lovely paintings (made by his father?). He brought down the price of the painting... but it being our last day in Istanbul, I decided not to buy...still regret it."

I was fooled by the minaret and the crescent on its dome, not having known that it was converted to a mosque at one point in history.However, as with anywhere else in Istanbul, if you have a few words of Turkish, people are very friendly and helpful and always ready to direct you.The mosaics and frescoes are absolutely breath-taking. Their vividity and colour astonished me, as the church dates to the 6th century. The audio guide was very useful, it was great to have some background on the fabulous art we saw.There were lots of friendly stray cats stretched out in the summer sunshine in the church grounds who were very appreciative of a bit of fuss.We got to the church by taking a tram to Erdinekapi. If you need to change at Topkapi as we did, you will need to buy another token.A trip to Istanbul would be lacking without a visit here!"

It is a little off the beaten path if you are spending most of your time in the Sultanahmet and Bazaar districts as we did but it is a 15 minute 25-30 Turkish Lira cab ride from there to the western walls where Chora is. It can get a little crowded but still worth the trip. You will get a crick in your neck from looking up at the ceilings and walls and I took my binoculars which really helped bring some of the intricate figures to life. I was able to fit this in to a 3 day Istanbul itinerary. I will try to post a trip report explaining how we did all the major attractions including Chora. On the way back, we walked to the old city walls that feature so prominently in the siege and subsequent fall of Constantinople in 1453. A great feeling to be able to climb up the wall. Then we walked down from there for about 15-20 minutes to the Golden Horn Ferry pier and rode the 25 minute ferry back to Eminou which was a nice little bonus. Don't miss it if you like this type of historical, architectural, artsy stuff."

We got contradictory advise on how to get there and probably the easiest is by taxi but where is the fun in taking the easiest option?! It is also confusing as the Church is known by a number of names including St Saviour Church. We caught a local bus from the bus station at Eminonu. You have to get off when you see the fortified city walls. Chora Church is signposted to the right from there. It is an amazing place - very different from the mosques and museums that we had already visited. Beautiful Byzantine mosaics and frescoes adorn the walls and colours are still vibrant despite their age. We got the impression that this little gem was a little 'off the beaten tourist track' and was therefore quieter than many of the other tourist sights. It is a little gem of a church worthy of the effort to get there. Photography is permitted without the use of flash. Stunning results can be obtained due to the close proximity of the pictures"

Kariye came up and I knew I needed to add it to my itinerary the next day! I grabbed a taxi from Taksim to Kariye and the driver knew exactly where to go, and cost me about 35 TL if I remember, it's a bit away from the main tourist area so I got a chance to see a bit more of the city as well. Tucked into a small residential neighborhood is the Church, overlooking more houses and a little city park from a hill. Surrounding the church is a tiny bit of tourism with some cafes and trinkets for sale, but nothing like the Sultanahmet old town of Istanbul of course. The church itself is rather small compared to Hagia Sofia, but the amount of artwork that is perfectly intact is amazing! Almost every single surface (walls, ceilings) has beautiful Christian artwork in an amazing state of preservation. Well worth the visit to take in all of the history and get away from the hustle and bustle of Sultanahmet and Taksim. I walked the surrounding streets a bit when I was done and took in all of the sights of this side of town, and was easily able to pick up another taxi once I made my way back to a main street."

Do not let him negotiate or anything. If he keeps driving, roll down your window and start yelling \"police.\" He will stop. Hand him a 5 (or nothing as we did) and walk away briskly."

Rarely will you see a jewel of comparable beauty in Europe, a church dating from early Byzantine years modified with mosaics and frescos in the mid-fourteenth century to depict the geneology and life of Christ. Although converted to a mosque after the Muslim conquest in the fifteenth century, the concealment of imagery and idolatry by plastering over the mosaic decorations has meant that they are now revealed after restoration to their original form and colours. Each panel tells a story starting from the journey to Bethlehem, the presentation before King Herod and the nativity through to the temptations and, in the frescos, the last judgement. A panel above the entrance to the nave depicts the fourteenth century initiator of the remodelling, Metochites, presenting the restored church as an offering to Christ. A priceless reward for the effort to find and get to Edirnetkapi to see this gem."

The audio tape is a bit hard to follow, and you may get a crook in your neck looking up, but the pictures on the ceiling are representative of Bible stories so that illiterate worshipers could see and understand the way that God had worked his will with His people. Also the surrounding merchants have souvenirs that are more easily accessible and are commensurate in price, quality and selection to the busier, more crowded venues like the Grand Pazar, etc. You can take a bus from downtown, but with traffic jams and construction, don't hesitate to call for a taxi as it will wend you up and up to the Kariye location.

The collection of frescos and mosaics of the Byzantine era are the second surpassed only by Hagia Sophia, but, in fact, I like Chora\u00b4s better because of their density. An interesting fact is that scenes displayed in some frescos regarding Holy Mary's life are so old, that these scenes are in fact no longer in the Bible. Audio guide is very recommended so you can have a detailed explanation of every mosaic. The church is really small so you can spend fair time listening to each mosaic explanation. Do not miss the mosaic of Christ with Theodore Metochites (the church creator) presenting a model of his church, it's a nice rarity.

Rick Steves' mass transit directions sounded rather diffcult and time-consuming, so we chose to take a taxi directly there, which was about the equivalent of $40 or $50 USD from the Galata area. The driver had no idea what the \"Chora Church\" was, but when we pointed to the name of \"Kariye Cami\" on the map he understood exactly where it was. The church is absuolutely the finest example of mosaics I have ever seen. The church is quite small, smaller than expected, but the entire inside of every wall and all the ceilings are covered with exquisite mosaics. I am not an expert by any means, but seeing these were really a spectacular experience for me and well worth the trip. An hour was all that was needed to see it all at a very lesiurley pace.

So we took a taxi which worked out to be a great idea considering the relative comfort as well got dropped at the entrance.After all that effort the museum was much smaller and not as impressive as the reviews suggested, especially if one has been to the bigger museums like the Istanbul history museum. The whole round was over in less than 20 minutes.In hindsight perhaps we should have taken the audioguide or a tour guide and might have had a better experience but we didnt.The Area around was nice with some decent souvenir shops and Asitane (one of the highly rated restaurants in Istanbul). But since it was our last day in istanbul couldnt stay back for long.If you have time on your hand you could combine this with a trip to the rest of Eyup by also visiting the Eyup Mosque and the Pierre Loti viewpoint. else give it a pass and you wouldnt be missing much"

Istanbul is a city of 15 million people, without the tourists, so depend on crowds wherever you go However, this church has crowd control, which allows for a good look before being told \"to keep the line moving.\" The frescoes and mosaic depiction in the ceilings has been largely kept in tact and depict the assumption of Christ followed by his birth and resurrection. An interesting mosaic is of Joseph being explained to the supernatural event of a child born while he was away for six months. It depicts the reaction of many a baffled young man who needs explanation as to how this event could take place. The upshot is hand made mosaic tiles depicting these events."

Don't worry, the Turks are so friendly, with no language between us, someone showed us with hands waving and fingers pointing where to get off (in a nice way) .much better way to travel! It is several blocks from the bus stop..fun to walk through the small streets. We encountered a bride and groom walking with their party after the wedding. They stopped and poised for pictures!! The church is marvelous..not on some tours, but don't miss! Some of the best frescoes and mosaics in the world! A small church packed with art. It was crowded when we went, but thinned out. Take your time. But go! It is on the 72 hour Museum Pass which includes other attractions in the city."

On our return we jumped on Bus #87 on the busy avenue Fevsi Pasa. The bus stop is a short walk from the church. You can take the bus to the base of the Ataturk bridge which gets you close to a lot of sites.

When you emerge from the station keep the mosque you can see on your right and head for the town you can see between the city wall and tower. Once inside the city walls take a left, I am not sure if it is the first but there is a Bridgestone shop on the corner and another shop with a green sign.

The exterior of the church is utterly charming seen from the shady garden in the back of the church. This, and the 11thC Kapnikarea in Athens, are my two favorite Orthodox churches, both are small, intimate architectural spaces that seem to engage the visitor on a personal level. Reams have been written about the glory of the Byzantine art in the Chora, many experts believing that the frescoes and mosaics are perhaps the greatest extent examples of Byzantine art. The crowning masterpiece of the church is the fresco called the Anastasis, or Resurrection, depicting Christ raising up Adam and Eve from their tombs at the end of time. What intrigues me about the frescos and the mosaics, many depicting the life of Mary according to the apocryphal gospel of St. James, is what the Byzantinist, Otto Demus has called the \u201cexperimental\u201d nature of the art in the Kariye\u2014said to look forward to the masterpieces of the Renaissance, in particular, to the later development of mannerism; the figures are said to revel in \u201casymmetry, instability, and unrest\u201d and in this sense they represent Byzantine art at its most experimental, creating a new mode of expression. Make sure to rent the excellent audio program to get a complete understanding of this marvelous church. It is no wonder that Trip Advisor contributors have ranked this the number one attraction in Istanbul and that is certainly saying something with the Aya Sofya and the Blue Mosque as rivals for one\u2019s attention. Absolutely needs to be visited."

It does not have the size, grandeur, or histroical importance of Hagia Sophia, but the Chora Church's mosaics are world class. This church takes you into the 11th century Byzanine world. The mosaics are a picture book of New Testament stories. You can imagine that the sermons delivered in this church concentrated on the lessons of these stories. The audio guide (10 lira) is very helpful in explaining the mosaics, the architecture, and history of the church.The church is small, as are the grounds, but the setting is still peaceful after all of these centuries and the build up of Istanbul. This used to be out in the country, but not anymore. There are some nicely shaded restaurants next to the church.It is easy to get to the church from the old part of Istanbul. But first remember that after all of these centuries, the church has picked up a number of names: The Chora Church, the Kariye Museum, the Church of St. Savior in Chora, the Church of Holy Savior in Chora, etc. Using the very convenient and inexpensive tram system:Take the T-1 tram from the Sultanahmet station west to the Topkapi station (this is not the Topkapi Palace). At the large Topkapi station, you will have to get on the T-4 tram going north. Get off at the third station, which is Edirnekapi (there is no transfer given so you will have to pay another fare). Once outside of the station, go east through the massive Istanbul walls by means of Fevzi Pasa Cad., which is a very busy street. Get onto the north side of the street and go three blocks to Seyh Eyup Sokagi and turn left onto Kalfaefendi Sk. This turns into Kariye Cd. The church is one block ahead.As I said, it is easy to reach the Chora Church. So how is it that my spouse and I got lost? Well, we are always confident that we know where we are going even if we are in a strange city on another continent. We never look at our map until we are sure we are lost. By the way, after you leave Edirnekapi station, if you find yourself in a gigantic cemetery, you went the wrong way."

Look out for the legs of the leper, impressively covered with spots though his upper body is lost. Avoid the large tour groups that go through. Their guides can be very loud and enthusiastic. Our enjoyment was compromised somewhat by an over-enthusiastic Italian guide much impressed with the Virgin Mary, a clear argument for individual hearing systems.

The crowds were much smaller than at other attractions that we visited.The ticket to enter cost 15 Turkish Lyra and the headset rental was another 15 Lyra.

Anyway, a lot of them are still in great shape, and wonderful to look at.The good news about the distance is that there aren't anywhere near as many tourists as you might expect. It's not exactly dead quiet, but it's not packed either.

I suggest reading about the church and mosaics first or buying the audio to see exactly how the mosaics fit together. I'm not religious but I can understand how the pictures must have awed the congregations almost 700 years ago especially when the lamplight hits the golden mosaic tiles. Be warned that because of the size of the church it can get crowded with tour groups and the ever present Istanbul cats. I really wasn't looking forward to seeing this church but it was my favorite attraction in Istanbul surpassing the Hagia Sofia.

As other contributors have said - the mosaics are stunning - although perhaps some of the restoration artwork around the mosaics looks a tad too bright to fit with the age of the original. I braved the crowd and got a stiff neck (a pair of binoculars or telephoto lens and a some way to support a cricked neck - would have helped) and went around the church several times in different directions - to really appreciate the details which are easy to miss under an arch or behind you first time around. But then I just couldn't take the snaps of the lenses - and the sheer amount of tourists alongside me. BTW - to get there - take an 87 bus from behind Taksim square - 20-30 mins depending on traffic. Get off near the end stop - where there is also a small road sigh saying Kariya Museum.

I've been all over the place, all over Turkey, Italy, Europe in general and there is nothing in the 30 countries I've been to that is similar to the Kariye Museum. It's almost more worth while than the Hagia Sophia. Honestly, it's the most amazing place I've been. It doesn't matter if you're a Christian or not, the artwork alone is so incredibly fascinating that every person who is in Istanbul should see this. It's included on the Istanbul Museumkart, thank goodness, because I doubt I'd have gone if it wasn't. It's simply unimaginable unless you see it. Go. Now."

An easy way to get here is to take a public bus from Eminonu to Edirnekapi (the old city walls) and there you'll see signs to Kariye Muzesi. The mosaics in this church are fabulous. They are utterly fantastic and blow everything in Hagia Sophia out of the water. I recommend getting the audioguide as it helps explain what biblical scenes are depicted in pictures and gives you a strategy for tackling the small but dense church. Most of the mosaics and frescos are wonderfully well-preserved and really give you a sense of just how important this building was to the benefactor who commissioned it. Also, after you're done, you can easily walk to the city walls and climb them for free, giving you some great views."

It is not that I do not like other churches I've seen in Greece, Russia, Israel, and elsewhere. But this one clearly plays in a completely different league, the same as San Francesco in Arezzo, San Marco in Venice, cathedrals of Siena or Pisa. Both the XI-XII mosaics, and the XIV frescoes are stunningly beautiful (and much better preserved, than those of Aghia Sophia, for instance). An absolute must for any visitor to Istambul, terribly much more important than any mosque, any palace, or Aghia Sophia itself, for that matter. There, you see Greek Byzantine art in its prime, absolutely au pair with the Italian Rinascimento."

The church is on the side that the bus stops and signposted.We chose this above the archaeology museum (too much to see in one visit) for the third day of our 72 hour museum pass on the basis that one museum a day is enough for us. We were not disappointed. The mosaics are very well preserved and, for northern Europeans, are a great opportunity to see so many works of the Byzantine era. The museum is far less crowded than the tourist 'honey pots' in Sultanahmet. It's easy enough to do a self guided visit with a well detailed book such as the Rick Steve's guide book as explanatory leaflets with the entrance ticket are not provided in Istanbul's museums. But even if, like us, you are not into the religious significance of the panels they can be appreciated as art.There are shops, cafes and a nice park close to the museum to pass a pleasant hour on top of the time to visit and the city walls are worth a closer look a few hundred metres further away."

We had no interest in visiting the bazaar, which was the organized activity for the morning, and elected to visit the Chora Church instead. I cannot imagine why the Chora Church is not included in every organized tour's itinerary. Perhaps the relative inaccessibility of the church precludes efficient transportation, but my wife and I regard our visit to the Chora Church as a highlight of our visit to Istanbul. The Chora Church is simply stunning. For a relatively small fee one can rent earphones through which one can listen to commentary on the mosaics. The commentary was useful, and I believe that those who did not spend their careers in the study of art would find the commentary well worth the small additional expenditure. Although one could in principle breeze through the church in short order, I recommend that the visitor allot an entire morning or afternoon to this experience. If my wife and I should be fortunate enough to visit Istanbul once more, we would surely allot an entire day to this lovely little museum."

A 12th century church with painterly frescoes and Byzantine mosaics that suggest art history development earlier than Giotto and the Italians. Powerful, moody faces and best news of all, you can get very close to them. Take a taxi from the Eminonu bus park--it could be as much as 20TL; pay attention to how you got there. After your visit, we walked down the hill and bumped into the commerical strip in the town of Balat. Walked through that, and then headed for the waterfront thinking we would take a Golden Horn ferry back. Not simple to do because, the Golden Horn ferry only stops on the south side @ Ayvansaray which is not that close to Balat. Catch a public bus to Eminonu from any stop along the busy waterfront cadd. We were there in wet, cold January; perhaps in the summer, it would be pleasant to walk these distances. "

It is a little out of the way, but well worth it for an opportunity to see the remains of the mosaics which the Byzantine era is noted for. It is affordable, and far less crowded than some other attractions (although admittedly we were there on a Saturday afternoon in December).It is a very beautiful place and you get as much time as you like to look at the art, most of which is in quite good condition because it was roughly plastered over rather than destroyed as it was in so many churches. The lighting was a bit dim, which made it difficult to take pictures since you couldn't use a flash, but presumably this is required to protect the paint. It was still well enough lit that you could view most of it.However, most of the best examples are well above eye level, so you need to crane your neck to see them. I found myself wishing there was a scaffolding to allow me to get closer to the ceiling work, because details were lost by distance. I suppose I would have been equally happy with a few benches or cushions which would allow me to lie down to contemplate the works.It is a bit light on the details of the specific pieces or the history of the era in which it was built, but if you've taken the time to do some basic research before visiting you won't feel that more plaques are needed.Most of the walls are not protected, although there are guards to prevent people from touching them. If you visit with small children you will probably be actively engaged in keeping them from touching things and they probably won't find the experience very interesting."

The box has to be opened for the mutli-language guides. This box is on the wall on the left side of the exit door as you are heading out of the church.

This is easily the most stunning building in all of Istanbul and the mosaics are absolutely breath-taking. Plan to spend time here; the longer you look at the mosaics, the more you come to appreciate them. The church is located quite a distance from most of the other attractions in the Sultanahmet area but it is well worth the bus or taxi ride.

Fortunately, I know it should be no more than 20TL from sultanahmet area to this church.So, we leaved him and took tram to sirkeci station and find the 2nd taxi driver, he ask for 25TL, we leaved him. Then we found an honest taxi driver, he ask for 20TL but we ask him to use the taximeter then he said ok, turn out it only cost us 14TL. On the way back, we took taxi that standby near Chora church,when we ask to use taximeter, he said yes, but this taxi driver is the worst, he manipulated the meter, from 2.70TL to 4TL then jump to 12TL and turn back to 6TL, but then suddenly become 15TL?!?! when we ask him what happen with his meter, he begin to yell to us, then drop us in the middle of nowhere. We were shocked!! Grab another taxi,luckily this last one is an honest man."

Allow around 30 - 45 minutes here for your walk around.The outside is unimposing, but as soon as you enter the chapel you are confronted with some of the most beautiful, intricate and intact byzantine work remaining in the world. The biblical characters and stories from your Sunday school lessons will come to life in mosaic, gold and muted fresco's.Sometime in the 16th century, during the Ottoman era, the church became a mosque and in 1948 it was commissioned as a museum. It is easy to become absorbed in capturing the artistry with your camera, but take a moment to sit in silent reflection and let the centuries of prayer and meditation feed your soul.There is a cafe here, however I did not stop, so cannot make a recommendation. It did seem popular.Enjoy."

I was particularly interested in how scenes, and the structures within the scenes, conformed to the arcs and arches of the domes and their supports. Take advantage of the audio tour; it is comprehensive, very interesting, and very quiet alternative to the babble of many guides in several languages at once.

Before you go read the background. These are the mosaics you need to see. Tiny church so easily visible. Few people seem to go except Monday since other museums are closed. The early Byzantine architecture and the use of marble to create decorative patterns instead of sculpture is intriguing. Some frescos but they seem to require serious restoration and are from a newer period. One of the top restaurants in town, Asatane, is next door but be sure to make a reservation. There is also a small hotel that looked inviting but I make no recommendation. Across the street is the usual cafe for kabobs and fresh juice. We shared the mixed platter and it was large and tasty.

The place had the feel of a tourist trap, although I am sure it is much more than that. The crowds of tourists, being led by their guides, in what is a fairly cramped space, did not help either.

Right next to the museum there is a wonderful Ottoman style restaurant. The food is a little pricy but good. We had an appetizer with four different assortments of cheese or beans. Each one was pounded with fresh local herbs. It is best of its class. These extras made the trip even more memorable."

Every year thousands visiting this museum don't seem to be aware of what other treasures there to be discovered within proximity.The Chora Museum was located within 5 minutes easy walking distance from the Theodosian Walls which were built in the reign of the emperor Theodosius II. They begin from the Sea of Marmara and extend to the gate of Kerkoporta. The latter is located between the gate of Adrianople and the palace of Constantine Porphyrogenitos. From the palace on, the walls continue down the 6th Hill, without a moat or outer wall inclusion, to adjoin with the sea at the Golden Horn. The walls and the towers, which are incorporated-in at every 55 meter intervals, are known to be one of the last greatest fortifications of antiquity. Today they seem to be resisting time most of its long stretch. The palace of Constantine Porphyrogenitos is at a short distance from the gate of Adrianople (present day Edirne kapi), that is the gate through which the young sultan Mehmet II made his entry to the city. From the top of the walls adjoining the palace you will have a striking view of the entire Golden Horn and after that that of the Topkapi palace and Hagia Sophia and beyond the Asia. As you continue exploring, and keeping the walls on your left, you pass through an interesting neighborhood where a close community, mostly gypsy families, live in poorly built little dwellings attached to or by the walls. The path will lead you down and pass by the gate of Kaligaria (Egrikapi) where the last Roman emperor Constantine XI Palaeologus Dragases was seen for the last time desperately fighting to save his empire. Further along down the walk path you come to the ruins of the Blachernae Palace, once a magnificent palace built by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. After him his grandson of Alexios, Manuel II had the imperial court transferred here.Blachernae Palace unfortunately witnessed the savage sacking on Constantinople by the crusaders of 1204. Nearby, attached to the walls is the famous Anames dungeons named after Michael Anemas. This section of the walls and towers stand rather imposing. At this point you may wish to have a break there you will find the Anames caf\u00e9, an ideal place to enjoy your tea viewing the hill of Pierre Loti at the far end of the Golden Horn.Further down the hill in a nice garden setting stands the church of Saint Mary of Blachernae, the imperial church, commonly known for its holy spring. This is one church where the congregations are held on Fridays instead of Sundays ever since the siege of the city by the Avar Turks in 626.This completes your tour of the hidden treasures of Istanbul located in proximity of Chora Museum."

This time around, the church is one of the top attractions in Istanbul considering the number of tourists buses that were outside the church. The church was packed! But the huge crowd was bearable, the problem was a guard. I accidentally stepped out of the church and I was of course not allowed to get back in. I tried to ask him a question (I got a little confused and could not remember where exactly the entrance was which was on the garden side. Apparently, he really did not know any English and he just kept on shouting at me to stay out. I told him I was only asking him a question, but he even ordered me to \"SIT\" while pointing to the nearby steps. He was very rude and arrogant. One would hope that with the amount of money they are raking in from the countless number of tourists that come continuously the whole day, they would be able to utilize people who can speak a little English and who would be a bit helpful, rather than plain arrogant. I tried to go back to the man entrance and tried to get permission to be allowed in. I still had my ticket and it had just been over an hour and a half since I got in the first time, but the guy manning the gate would not let me back in either. All I wanted to do was to take some pictures of the garden. I simply don't understand what the big deal was all about. What harm could I possibly do the second time around? So I guess my warning would be, don't step out of the door unless you are really, really ready to leave - because there is no prayer in heaven that would allow you to get back in again.But of course, the mosaics are out of this world. One never tires of looking at them. This is my 4th time in Kariye and one can never get tired of those paintings. It is a real treasure and I hope the paintings will be preserved forever. "

Situated away from the main Istanbul city, I took the tram, the metro, the underground metro and walked to and from this Church. Good hearted Turks went out of their way, to lead us to the nearest metro station. They spoke Turkish; we spoke English. But has full blown conversations for hours. The Chora church is near to the Golden Horn and was built at the outskirts of the famous city of Constantinople. When I reached the church early morning, I was among the few tourists who actually made this one of their stops. The ambience was beautiful, silent, with the gentle wind blowing into my hair. I sat on the benches outside and observed people for around 30 mins. before I actually went into the church. It is a small church with all the characteristics of Byzantine architechure. The key attraction here are the fresco paintings that have survived time, nature and history. There are quite a few controversial frescos as well. There is a mosaic of Church on the Throne, the Resurrection Christ pulling Adam and Eve out of their tombs, the 2nd coming of Christ and many many other stories depicted on the walls and domes of this church.This church was once used to help sheild fighters against the Ottoman onslaught. This was also converted into a mosque in under the Muslim Ottoman reign. They covered the beautiful mosaic art and frescos under walls of plaster to keep people from seeing symbolic imageries. Now the Church of Chora is a museum standing tall, beautiful and proud against the test of time. Try and visit this unique masterpiece. You will enjoy it."

The mosaics which depict the life of Jesus and Mary are incredible. I will add some non flash photos I took but they really don't do the church justice. It is one of the few museums that vandals haven't ruined the mosaics or frescoes with graffiti. Well worth the 15 TL entrance fee. Take the time to see every section of the church and then enjoy a cold drink at the restaurant behind the church. Getting there was a little challenging but follow these directions and you will get there easily enough. At Eminonu (opposite the ferries) you will find the bus station. Find bus number 32 or 38 or any other bus that goes to Edirnekapi. You will need an Istanbulcarte to catch the bus (it's 2.75 TL each way when you swipe your card. Simply purchase one from the newsagent type booths scattered all over Istanbul . You can use the Istanbulcarte on the tram too .. cheaper than buying the tokens). When you get off at Edirnekapi walk back the way you came for about 40 metres and a street on the left takes you to the Chora Church (Kariye Museum). It will be signed but look back when you get to the street mentioned because the sign is facing the other way and not the way you are walking. On returning get any bus that says Eminonu to get back to the bus station. Sounds complicated but it's not and 5.50 TL return is cheaper than getting a taxi (approx 50 TL). Enjoy."

Churches that were painted over as mosques and then later stripped back and recovered form a central part of the complex history of this region, and there are beautiful examples in Macedonia, Bulgaria and elsewhere. This one is spectacular and not to be missed. Pick a time when tours do not go. They can be avoided.

The city walls of the old empire capital were built around the 5th century, it is said that the Chora Church (chapel) existed prior to the city walls going up & was outside of those first walls. In Turkish the word \"Kariye\" is derived from the Greek word \"Chora\" meaning outside the city...And if you're staying in the old city/Sultanahmet sections or across the water, it is a bit of a trip to this once outer limit of the city walls. Cabs & buses run to the area, don't quote me but I think the cab ride from Topkapi area was around 40 Turkish lira. There is a modest entrance fee (again set by the Turkish museum system), but well worth it if you are into the architechture of the 6th century, and later Byzantine art forms. The church was converted into a mosque in the early 1500's, when in 1945 it was converted to a museum. It was through that period that most of the beautiful frescoes & mosiacs in the Byzantine style were discovered & restored. These are some of the finest examples of this art form you will find. There are restrictions on flash photography, but I found there was ample natural lighting, especially for digital photos. It can get cramped inside, especially if there are several tour groups there at once...patience may be a virtue during your visit. There is a Turkish government shop there with a wide range of interesting & affordable items, reference books, guides, etc. There areseveral small eateries within walking distance, but I have not been to them. If memory serves me right, the museum is closed on Wednesdays. A nice side trip on way back to where ever you are staying, would be a stop at the Spice Market area. This area offers a very wide range of unique shopping experiences, great visual & olfactory input, and a great range of eateries, bakeries & street food."

We caught a tram from Sireci and then two trains to get there which was easy enough (with a bit of help from the ever friendly locals). Then after a sincerely admiring visit of the church (complete with audio guide which was good) we wended our way down to the Golden Horn getting pleasantly lost in the alleyways en route and sustaining our energy levels by arbitrary stops in patisseries with delectable home-made dishes. Lucky it's downhill to the river because we could have rolled if need be. Then instead of looking for a ferry boat we walked back to Eminonou along the river front and again were the only tourists in sight most of the time. It took about 2 hours of very slow walking to get back. Don't miss this opportunity to see the non-touristy side of Istanbul."

The mosaics and frescoes tell stories from the life of Jesus and of Mary. The walls and ceilings are covered with these colourful, detailed pictures. it is useful to have a little booklet (or something similar) with all the pictures and their location so you can follow the thread of the stories more easily. The only potential downside of a visit is a sore neck from gazing up at the paintings! That is a small concern really - given what there is to see...."

Getting to it takes initiative - we took a ferry up the Golden Horn then a taxi (10 TL) from Ayraskoy (sp.?). We caught the bus back, but more by good luck. Like most such sites in Turkey it is poorly managed. There is an English brochure, but to get it you have to ask a security officer, who dispenses it surreptitiously from a locked box on the wall. Why? Presumably to encourage you to purchase the audio guide? But do see this extraordinary survival!"

Getting there and walking around the neighborhood is part of the fun - if you like to do things independently. At the Sultanahmet tram stop, take the T1 in the direction opposite to going to the ferry piers. Have 2 tokens for each person taking the trip - one when you board the T1 and another when you transfer to the T4. Get off at the Topkapi tram stop (not to be mistaken with Topkapi Palace). Transfer to the T4 tram - you're getting on at the terminus for T4 so there is only one direction to go. Get off at the third stop (Edirnekapi). From the tram stop you can walk to Khora Church. There are signs but they are not always clearly visible. When in doubt all you need to do is ask people on the street. Remember to ask for \"Kariye\" not \"Khora\". People are very helpful. After visiting this gorgeous church, walk around the neighborhood to get a feel for the lives of ordinary Turks. If you feel you are getting lost, ask people again for directions. You can either retrace your way back using the tram or, if you are really adventurous in the neighborhoods like us, you can find your way to a pier on the Golden Horn where you can take the inexpensive ferry back to the historical center."

We got ripped off by a taxi driver who was waiting outside the chuch when we left - be aware that even if a price is agreed its not always adhered to. We gave the original amount only and the driver wasn't happy but be aware this does happen. For such a major attraction this was a disappointing end to the visit."

Take the ferry to get here as you get a nice view of the city from the water. You can then taxi or bus back to the Galata bridge. Walk around the neighborhood as well, to get a true flavor of a real working city neighborhood. The waterfront park area is a nice respite from a very busy city, particularly on a hot day!"

The frescoes are beautiful, but the mosaics were unbelievable! I could have looked at them for hours. I do mosaics as a hobby and I tried to imagine the workman hours and skill that went into this church and It boggles the mind.The section featuring the life of The Virgin Mary and her parents was especially of interest as I had not seen anything like this before.I will visit it again when I am in Istanbul preferable in low season when I can really enjoy. I found taking pictures was an effort as there were so many people, tour groups, so I bought the postcard booklet with all the frescoes and the Mosaics and just enjoyed myself in the moment, rather than struggle to take mediocre pictures."

Chora's are probably of equal quality, although the style is 600-700 years newer. Chora is certainly worth the trip. It's about a four mile drive from Sultanahmet. For those going there I would also recommend taking a short walk to the old city walls. They are about 1500 years old and definitely worth seeing."

I arrived when the museum first opened and had free movement for about an hour. Then the hordes of tourists arrived pushing their way thru the museum; snapping tiny digital cameras at everything without thought, but missing the experience of the beauty and wonder of this former church.Easy to get to from Eminonu main bus station. Nice gift shop, and outside many places to have a drink and a little bite to eat."

Though situated a little bit away from usual touristic sites of the city, Kariye Museum is definitely a must see in Istanbul: once you step in, you are carried away from the present and you are really amazed of the environment thanks to beautiful mosaics and frescoes dating back from the 10th and 11th century. This place which is a museum today, used to be a church first, then was converted into a mosque during Ottoman Empire days and since the establishment of Turkish Republic, serves as a museum. There are a total of 90 mosaics and frescoes inside, on the walls and in the ceilings. Each of them signifies and symbolises important messages. Without knowing those meanings, touring the museum will be a mere contemplation of art work and that will be too limited. Therefore, I recommend you go there with a knowledgeable guide or make the tour with audio guides available at the entrance. The museum shop, though small, offers not only souvenirs but also good books about Istanbul and history and arts. Beware: once you enter the museum, you can use your electronic ticket again for the same place only after 3 hours: as at the exit, there is a cafe, many visitors would like to take a break there and continue but this 3 hours limit create a problem for them. Next to this museum, there is also one of the best Ottoman restaurants of the highest quality (Asitane), so, you can combine a lunch or dinner for after the visit as well."

It was OK as the weather was fine, but the best thing is taking a taxi from wherever you\u00b4re staying to avoid all the hassle.The Church was built in the early 14th century, but was converted into a mosque in the 16th century. The art work was forgotten until 1860, when it was rediscovered in a bad shape. Restoration work did not begin until after the Second World War. The church is now a museum with slightly faded, but beautiful, Byzantine mosaics dealing with the life of Christ, and frescoes with scenes from the Old Testament. Majestic!Afterwards you have a chance to try typical Ottoman cuisine in restaurant Asitane - if you dare! Consult the Trip Advisor comments first."

But by all means, don't miss it. Since the Virgin Mary is even more important in the Eastern Orthodox tradition than in Western Christianity, many of the mosaics of the church tell the story of her life and that of Jesus. It's astonishingly beautiful, yet little known among those who visit Istanbul."

It is about a 20 minute/20 turkish lira drive from Taksim Square. Our taxi driver out there tried to charge us 25 TL but we referred to the meter (that had 17 before he turned it off) and we gave him 20. The first taxi we asked for the ride back wanted to charge us 30 so we didn't go with him and simply walked a couple of blocks to the busy street, where we easily found a taxi that went to Taksim for 20. Anyway...The church has beautiful mosaics of Christ's life and ministry, and also of Mary's life. The detail is amazing and many of them shine with gold and other brilliant colors. They are close, so you can really see them well. No flashes are allowed, but it is light enough that you can take pictures without a flash. There is a side room with impressive life-sized frescoes as well, and most are very well-preserved. Very much worth the taxi ride (despite some negotiation required)."

It is open all the seasons,and a good escape from other toursiic attractions whicxh are full of toursits in Istanbul. no need to vait in the long queques like Topkap\u0131 or Hagia sophie. But it would be beneficial to read about the scenes of Gospel apocryfical and Luka,Yuhanna,Matta,Marcos. If you dont like reading,you can find a guide who can read the scenes to you and you can also discuss about them:) I especially liked the Paraclesion,beacuse there was a detailed scenerey pf Paradise,hell and the last judgament day. It really deserves to be visited. Also the museum is very close to other attractions like Blacherna Palace and Holy spring of Blacherna. Give yourself a day to explore the museum,and the area.

I think it costs 15 TL a person. We came here on our 4th day in Istanbul as we already explored everything in the historical and european part of istanbul. It was difficult to get to, but it was worth it because of the things nearby. Right next to the chora church is a restaurant called Asitane, which was one of the best restaurants we ate at in Istanbul. We came here for a late lunch after our visit to the church. They specialize in ancient ottoman cuisine. They researched the recipes of the topkapi palace and then serve them on their menu, they include dates from which originate (ex: 1500s). The atomosphere was beautiful. Unfortunately we came on a monday, and apparently there is traditional turkish music played from thursday to sunday. ~ 110 TL for 2 with 2 appetizers, 2 mains, and 2 turkish coffees.Another thing to visit is the walls of istanbul a short walk from the church. You can climb stairs to get to the top of the wall and see the view.Another thing to visit is a hill nearby, recommended by our hotel, where you can take the cable car up and see a nice view of istanbul. Unfortunately we came on a cloudy day so it was not as beautiful as it could be. Information on how to get around: We took ferry from Eminou to Ey\u00fcp where the hill is located (~ 30 min, 2 TL, unfortunately only once an hr). Then we walked to cable car and took it up to the hill (2 TL), but is definitely walkable. Enjoyed the view. It was suggested to get a turkish coffee and enjoy the view but we came at the same time as a tour bus and it was very crowded so we didn't. We walked down through the cemetery, which was interesting in itself. From there we took a taxi to Chora church (~ 7 TL). We visited the church (~15 TL). Then had a late lunch at Asitane. We then walked to the city walls, and walked up to see the view. We walked along the wall until we got to the Ayvansaray ferry dock (it was kind of a run down neighborhood so I suggest to stay on main streets) and took the ferry back to Eminou."

The Chora Church is as beautiful as the Capella Sistina and more historically important. When we visited it, we stayed with open mouth for a long time because we couldn't believe the perfection of art we were enjoying. Unfortunetely lots of its frescoes have been destroyed by the Turks during the centuries. Also we couldn't believe that the Turks permitted dogs and cats wandering through the Church.

Almost all of the interior decoration\u2014the exquisite frescos, the famous mosaics and the less renowned but equally striking mural paintings\u2014dates from about 1320.The mosaics and frescos are considered some of the best in the world. The first mosaics you\u2019ll see are dedicated to Jesus and Mary. Then you\u2019ll visit two small domes of the inner narthex which focus on Jesus\u2019 ancestors (all the way back to Adam). Then the next series of mosaics outlines Mary's life, and another, Jesus's early years. The final series concentrates on Jesus' ministry.Then there is the Parecclesion which is a side chapel holding the famous frescos, which focus on the death and resurrection of Christ. Don\u2019t forget to look up and all around the room, including the doors you just came through.For four centuries after the Ottoman conquest of Istanbul it served as a mosque (Kariye Camii), and all of the Christian artwork was covered due to the prohibition of images in Islam. The frescos were covered by dirt, paint, and plaster for centuries until the former glory of Chora Church was entirely forgotten. The building was rediscovered in the mid-19th century and restored by the Turkish government.The building facing the Kariye Museum was once the Kariye Muhallebicisi or Pudding Shop, an old Istanbul institution. It now serves a variety of refreshments and is a delightful way to wait for the rest of your party to finish their tour of The Chora Church.Also, there is a small but nicely appointed gift shop just before exiting the museum. They have nicely priced items that will catch you eye.Although this isn\u2019t as popular of a tourist attraction as Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern, Topkapi Palace, or the Blue Mosque, it really is a delightful gem and shouldn\u2019t be missed.CLOSED WEDNESDAY."

Thus, you either take a taxi here or take a bus from Eminonu, get off at the appropriate stop (let the bus driver know which stop you want to get off at), and then be armed with a street map to help guide you there even though there are signs pointing the way. Chora Church has a good number of Christian icons still preserved in good order. While not a large church, many of the icons were whitewashed over rather than descrated or removed; thus, centuries-old icons are there for your observation, admiration, or adoration. I was surprised at the number of visitors there were the day that I visited in November 2011. I advise that you rent the audio headphones to get the maximum information while you are touring the inside of the church, or skip the audio headphones and buy the color guidebook for 30 TL and read about each icon as you wander through the Church. For those who have a strong interest in the icons, i also recommemd you visit the Pammakaristo church about 1/4 mile walk from Chora Church. It's harder to find but with a map in hand, you should be able to find it on foot given a 20 minute walk. You'll need the map to find your way back to the main street to catch the bus back to central Istanbul or have a taxi take you there and have him wait or walk back to Chora Church where taxis are abundant."

The museum has just started offering audio tours - we were the first people to try the English version, which we found very helpful if occasionally confusing (do I turn to my left to see the next scene, or the figure's left?).When you first get there, it doesn't look like much - the building is small, hemmed in by its surroundings, and inside it is just a few smallish rooms, and the largest section, the sanctuary, is mostly mosaic-free.

If you have some time to kill, I woudl recommend it, but make sure your cab driver knows where they are going because it's hidden! We attempted to metro there and then walk and found it very difficult to locate. By the time we got there, it was extremely crowded and seemed small given the effort to get there. I'm sure had we just cabbed, we would have been more focused on the Christian mosaics. We got a museum pass from our hotel for The Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Mosaic Museum, Chora Museum, and the Archaelogical Museum. The pass is good for 3 days and allows you to skip the line. I would highly recommend the pass!"

We were there with a guide who could tell us the story in each panel, but even without that help the assembled images paint a rich picture of devotion and artistic capability.

It is not all that big...about an hour will do it max. The mosaics are worth the trip. Very beautiful!But what we liked as well was walking around this area. It is residential with the old city walls along the edge. You can follow the walls down the hill back to the city. An interesting walk with lots of local activity. Very good for phototgraphy."

Take metro line head to Havalimani (Airport) stop at Topkapi-Ulubatli (when coming from Aksaray) stay on same side and take first street on your left getting out of Metro \"Kaleboyu Caddesi\".

They were worth a look, fristly as still standing since before 1453, secondly you get to see the various lines of defense old cities had, for real!! The church is hard to find, and in the end a lovely old man showed us the way. Would advise reading up on the church beforehand, or buying a guide as there is no information whatsoever about the frescos. It took my breath away, and this is after most of the frescos were destroyed when changed into a mosque. it is not as magestic,or as awesome as the hagia sophie, but as it is small, and more frescos have been perserved, it is more moving. We walked back to the city centre, briskly, as two women, even in the afternoon, we felt could not linger. Along the way, there are very 'interesting' bridal shops, and one passes where Constintine the Emperor was buried."

We used Rick Steve's walking tour which provided excellent information about the Chora Church itself as well as the neighborhood. The Church is beautiful, while not of the same huge magnificence as the Hagia Sophia; its relative smallness and obscurity provides a peaceful addition to your Istanbul experience. Before we entered the complex, we had lunch at the conveniently located restaurant, eating outside where we could have the the Byzantium architecture for our view. We are so glad we made the time to include this in the list of 'must sees.'"

A bit pricey, but I think it was worth the 10TL or so to see the magnificent mosaics. It doesn't take long to visit this little beauty, so suggest you couple it with the old city walls and perhaps Yedikule fortress. In detail:First, take public transit to Edirnekap\u0131 station-- Chora Church is about a 10 minute walk through an 'authentic' part of Istanbul, really really fun to see. On your way to the church, you'll walk right past the old city walls. We took the time to climb up one of them to a tower (it's all just open!) and had some great views of the city. After you do Chora Church, take a cab to Yedikule to the south (about 10 minutes, 12TL). The ride is all along the old walls, quite fun!"

After the otoman invarion, in 1511, Chora was converted into a mosque and all decoration was covered with plaster. In 1945 it was converted in a musem, and a full restoration was completed in 1959 by the American Bizantine Institute, when all decoration was uncovered.It is a good idea to get there by cab/taxi.

It boasts one of the best and well preserved mosaics an frescoes in its interiors. These mosaics and frescoes depicts the life of Christ from childhood to adulthood to crucifixion and beyond, so watch carefully and I just hope you follow the sequence. If you are interested to know the stories of each phase of the fresco, you might want to get a licensed tour guide in the area.It's impressive so take a day out of the usual tourist path and go to there. People say it's out of the way or transport is complicated, but those were in theory, in reality it's easy. Been to Istanbul several times and I always miss this place so one day I decided to check the location on google map, and I figured there must be a way to go there by tram -- not bus.I was staying near Beyazid tram station (2nd stop from Sultanahmet, so if you're in Sultanahmet, it's the same tram) so I took the tram the one going to Zeytinburnu, get off at the 8th station called Topkapi (10th from Sultanahmet), then from Topkappi tram station walk up to the gound level and few steps - you will see it immediately, take the Metro that goes to Mescid-e-Selam and get off at the 3rd station called Edirnekapi. Get out and walk your way to the wall and you'll see what looks like an entrance between walls which is actually a highway/road, just beside one of the wall to your left is a small stairs and go up there and on the first street on your right walk your way down until the end and youll find the Chora Church on your left. Don't worry, all people in that area knows the place, I asked the old man selling bottled water near the walls of Constantine, and there's also a sign. Entry Fee = TL15."

Right by the church are some remains of the old city walls. You can climb us to the top for a nice view of the city. If you are lucky, you will coordinate your climg to the top with the call to prayer. It is really neat to hear all the nearby mosques calling at the same time. We payed 15TL each way from Eminonu for a taxi. You could probably walk it though it is a bit far. The Rick Steves guide has a walk that starts from the church but we decided to skip this one."

Anyway, I took public transport to get here (very easy). The church has several sections, and each area has several mosaics depicting scenes from the life of Christ. Now, I'm not at all religious, but seeing stories from the Bible over head in finely constructed mosaics was nothing short of breathtaking. My book walked me through every scene and it made me appreciate the place even more. There was a section near the entrance that has some impeccably done frescoes from centuries ago. This church is a must-see, and on my next visit to Istanbul, I'm definitely going back here again!"

You wouldn't just spend 15 minutes in the Cistine Chaple or the Duomo in Florence, their art and beauty command respect. So too does the Chora. The mosaics and artwork from the last great flurishing of Byzantine church art are stunning. Yes, the church is on the small side, but it makes the artwork all the more accessible. Spend the time with a good guide book or better yet hire a guide to walk you through the biblical scenes depicted. Indeed, I would argue that only in viewing the art of the Chora can you begin to have some idea of just dazzling the Aya Sophia or St. Irene's or St. Surgious and Baccus would have been in their full glory. It is also at the Chora that you can begin to understand the artistic roots that ultimately helped to transformed art during the renaissance. The Chora is a special place, well worth the time and effort to see and understand not only the art that exists there, but how it has been conserved. Additionally, the neighborhood is close (very walkable) to the Tekfur Saraiy -- the remains of part of the Byzantine palace complex of the Blacharnea as well as the impressive Byzantine land walls. Truely one of the most impressive and moving monuments in a city full of impressive monuments."

I was dumbfounded in front of it. You have to be something of a Byzantine art afficionado, or know something about it at least. But then it is VERY rewarding. There is nothing as good as this in Greece."

The 10turkish lira guidebook is very helpful because it gives a plan to follow as the mosaics are not in an obvious biblical order. The cats in the garden are more numerous than anywhere else.A taxi is a good idea because its a bit difficult to find. If you get a taxi back make sure that the meter is on. It's the only place where a high fixed price was offered to me first."

The church is quite lovely, with a sweet but small garden, and several cafes across the street, but otherwise hidden and surrounded by working class apartment buildings. It's like a little spot of beauty hidden away. Of course the mosaics are wonderful, although not all of them are restored. The main area is empty and haunting, and if you can get in there when there isn't a tour, and you can experience the space alone, it's pretty amazing. When I was there, there were 4 large tour groups there, which really overwhelmed the space. I waited until it thinned out and then really had a chance to look around. It is not large, but it is worth seeing. The mosaics show scenes from the life of Mary, and it would probably be very interesting to read about the specific scenes before you visit there."

If you love mosaics go here .... and if you don't, you might give it a miss.I feel I might be a bit out of step with the other rave reviews in this section, but the location away from the other sites, and the relative cost ,15TL, (10US$) leads me to believe that if you have limited time or budget, there are other things in Istanbul more worth seeing.The mosaics are excellent and tell stories of the life of the Virgin and the infancy of Christ, anyone who goes specifically to see the mosaics will not be disappointed. The mosaics here are better than those in Ayasofya.The building itself is not achitecturally beautiful and is tucked away on a side street. I went on bus 28 and found it difficult to locate without asking directions and a reasonable amount of walking. If you were visiting as part of a tour then you might feel more positive about the experience."

One of the transcepts is entirely devoted to the Virgin Mary with unusual scenes of her life. While there are amazing mosaics in the Hagia Sophia, the Chora Church is very small and intimate. From its simple exterior, one would never guess the treasures inside. I highly recommend it."

I had a wonderful time on the tour and our guide, Abdurrahman Yaramis from Backpackers Travel was more than we could have ever asked for- he is very intelligent, charming, professional, informative, and has very good English. The tour was around the old city/Sultanahmet in Istanbul and we saw 7 sites all together; sites more difficult to get to than the Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque. I would recommend this tour highly to anyone. All of the places we visited were very worth it and showed you a lot about the city and history. The transportation was very good as well- I commend the very good driving in such difficult streets in the old city! They even brought us peach juice and a sweet bread for breakfast! Very good value for the price of 15 euro (about $20) for hotel pick-up in Sultanahmet at 9:00 am until 1:00 pm. Drop off at the Spice bazaar or back at hotel."

The Chora Church/Kariye Muzesi is located along the Theodosian Walls, separated from the remainder of the tourist destinations in Istanbul. We took a bus (90 I believe) from Eminonu towards Edirnekapi. The stop for the Chora Church is right after the soccer stadium on the right hand side of the bus, about 10 blocks or so past the Fatih Camii.Entry was about 15 TRY, but it is worth it!. The church itself dates to 1077 (give or take) and the mosiacs inside date to 1315-21. Enter into the Paracclesion, and turn to the right. Look up, and you are underneath a rib dome depicting the Virgin and Child and Attendant Angels. Continue in the Paracclesion and two outstanding frescoes are visible: The Last Judgement and Anastasis or The Resurrection.The Interior Narthex is adorned with the Geneology of Christ inside one rib dome and the Ancestors of the Virgin Mary in the northern rib dome. Large mosaics of St. Peter and St. Paul flank the entrance into the Inner Nave and Apse. The Inner Nave and Apse are marble, and a mihrab is almost hidden with the Apse. Any frescoes in the dome have been whitewashed over - in comparison to the remainder of teh church, the Inner Nave and Apse seem barren. Only three mosaics are here, including the Dormition of the Virgin Mary over the exit to the Inner Narthex.The Exterior Narthex contains more mosaics, including The Journey to Bethlehem, Enrollment for Taxation, Nativity, and the Temptation of Christ.Simply put, the works within the Chora Church are remarkable and one of the highlights of our trip to Istanbul. I could easily have spent half a day inside the museum staring at the mosaics and remembering stories from the Bible. If/when we go back to Istanbul, this will be visited again.If you have a DSLR here are some recommendations: Wide angle (12-24mm), Medium fast telephoto (50-150mm F2.8), Shake reduction/image stabilization, monopod. No flash photography!Here is my flickr site: http://www.flickr.com/photos/dhoopercu/sets/72157617165541075/"

I would like to second that this is a must visit for anybody visiting Istanbul. It is a bit off the beaten track, but it's really not too far. If you're up for walking, I wandered over here from the Blue Mosque, stopping at several mosques along the way, and it was quite lovely (took less than 3 hours at a leisurely, stopping-often pace).The inner narthex mosaics are of Mary's life from an apocryphal gospel, which I found to be quite interesting. While it's smaller, I found this church to be as interesting as the Haghia Sophia in many ways--you won't regret taking the time to see it."

The current building was built in the 11th Century. It has been used as a Church, a Mosque and a museum. The Byzantine mosaics and murals are awesome! The murals date from around 1320 that should not be missed. Although there is not much near the museum it was worth the trip for us."

We took my Turkish friend who was showing us around Istanbul during our stay to this place, and she ahd not even heard about it before!This church is absolutely amazing! We took a bus to get here, sorry I do not remember exactly which one. Upon exiting the bus, we asked directions from a nice man who led us almost the enitre way there. It is about a 20 minute ride from the Beyazit area, and it is interesting to see life farther out in the city.It is a beautiful Byzantine church. I love the Byzantine architecture! The mosiacs inside are well-preserved and beautiful. Because of the smaller size of the church, you are also much closer to the mosiacs and can appreciate them more than in Hagia Sophia. The way some of the mosiacs have come off, with the sketches and drawings underneath also offers an intersting perspective into how the mosacis were made.The entire museum is a gem and should be on anyone's must see list in Istanbul!"

This museum seems to have different names in different guidebooks, and my friend accidently referred to it as the Charo Museum (which it is not), but it is an absolute must. We took a taxi from the Sultanahmet to the museum and then grabbed another taxi which was just hovering around the museum to get back. The mosaics in this church are incrediblly detailed, moving, dramatic and poetic. Bring a zoom lens for your camera to be able to see into the rafters. You will crane your neck for a while looking up but really worth it. There is nothing else surrounding this museum really. You can wander a little ways away to see some of the ancient wall which circled the city. Unfortunately when we were there it was under restoration and you couldn't get close. Lunch at the Asitane restaurant at the hotel next door to the museum is a must. They have a very unusual menu and you will enjoy the outdoor garden and unusl offerings."
