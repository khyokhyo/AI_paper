We visited Hoan Kiem Lake around 5h.30 pm, a lot of activities at this time of afternoon, mainly exercise by locals. The atmosphere is fantastic. A nice flat walk, see the locals in action, keep to the shade. At the weekend, a lot of people walking around the lake and vehicles is not permitted go here. Absolutely need to see this if you visit Hanoi."

This area was bustling with activities and there were people from all walks of life. There were sketch artists making sketches of the people sitting on the pavements. The lake looked serene and we were told about the history behind this lake which was quite interesting. Best time to visit is during the weekends as the roads are open only to pedestrians and you can see people having a good time with their scooters, hover boards etc. There are many shops around this place. During evenings it may be even better."

The famous Water Puppet theater is also beside the lake. In night the lake is brilliantly lit and it gives an amazing view.

Lots of pet lovers taking out their canine for a walk as well. The lake comes with a legend in which the king won the war with a sword given by deity/god . Upon success he returned the sword to the mouth of the tortoise. Prior to Apr 2016 there is a large tortoise around 2m in diameter but it passed away this year. So that was a bit sad. The lake is also known as Green Lake as the water reflection is green color. I walked by the lake about 8 times in my short visit there. It is really breezy and relaxing to while away the time."

We were lucky enough to be there during the mooncake festival (8th montth of Chinese lunar calendar). This is a huge children's festival in Vietnam so there were many activities for the kids. Adults were also welcome to try. I liked that many of the activities were traditional games.Cross the bridge and visit the temple by the lake. Read about the legend of the lake... I didn't know lake turtles grew so big! Plenty of photo ops around the lake and from the pagoda. Then have a meal at one of the restaurants beside the lake or pack a take away and sit by the lake to wait for sunset. There are plenty of places to chill out and this is a great opportunity to mingle with the locals as well. The roads leading to the lake are closed on these evenings so there's no traffic and no exhaust to worry about.The lights come on at about 7 pm ... more clicking! I love the lights from the turtle pagoda. It's easy to walk around the whole lake and there are plenty of hawkers selling drinks and snacks."

Reaching it through the busy narrow lanes is a great experience in itself. The lake is an island of tranquillity in the middle of racing Hanoi traffic. There are wide pavements around it and a small amount of parkland, busy with people doing Thai Chi or practicing ballroom dancing. A small temple is situated on an island in the lake, surrounded by foliage, and reached by an impossibly picturesque red arched bridge. There is a charge to enter the temple. There is also a smaller pagoda in the water. It's well worth walking the whole way round to see the views (it's not particularly big) and enjoy the relative peace before diving back into the madcap world of the old quarter."

In the mornings and evenings surrounding the lake, throngs of residents nearby gather to exercise in groups and/or bring their families and pets for walks. We've even witnessed a 'laughing yoga' group where strangers gathered to hug, smile and laugh with each other. What a sight to behold as where we come from, the sense of community and togetherness is definitely not up to par with what we saw around the lake, if none at all.During the weekends (Fri - Sun), the government has recently ordered for the roads around the lake to be closed off for people to walk. Many people make full use of this chance to come out to the lake, and the crowd can be C-R-A-Z-Y during the weekends. If you are there at night on a weekend, you will know what I mean!Tip: If you need to get some water, try the vending machines around the lake as they only costs 5,000VND as opposed to the stalls where they'll charge you double. But the machines don't give changes so make sure you have exact amount/notes with you. Otherwise, there are tons of other shops and cafes nearby for you to get other drinks.PS: As you know, the lake has a story that involves a turtle. Our guide told us that a turtle that had lived in the lake for over 1000 years had died recently, presumably due to pollution and the trash that visitors throw into the lake. We are not sure if the turtle is the same turtle as told in the legend, but what a shame and how sad!!! So, remember please do not throw trash into the lake if you're there!"

There are cafes along the lakeside for a quick stop and the prices there are reasonable. It is very relaxing and easy to do with benches to sit and while away an hour or so. It is also just a very short walk from the French quarter or from the old towm but beware the traffic - crossing the road can be very hazardous!"

The Lake has wonderful garden and trees to allow a cooling experience if you decide to take a casual walk around it. At different times of the day you can see people exercising, picnicking, playing and more. At one end is the Ngoc San Temple which you enter via pedestrian bridge at the West end. The temple is an experience in itself and quite busy with locals and tourists exploring the area. Spending some time exploring the Temple is definitely worthwhile and watching the locals gives some understanding of its importance. There are people selling memento's and artwork, some is good, rest make your own judgement. There were musicians and people exercising, families picnicking and playing. Once we had explored the Temple we had a local explain the story of a giant turtle which lives in the Lake and how back in history had conquered an invading army. Not to sure about that one but we were all encouraged to look out for a turtle in the Lake. There is a walk path around the edge of the Lake and covered with trees. It makes for a comfortable walk in the shade as you meander around and can look at garden Ares as well. We walked the boundary once and then caught a rickshaw the second time - just a hoot as we talked with the rider pedalling and talking as we went.Where the Ngoc San temple is at on end and surrounded by trees, your eyes are drawn to the Thap Rau Temple at the other end. This stands on a small island and is not accessible. The image of this Temple is one of the iconic images of Hanoi and appears on many postcards and artwork. This area is a must do for any visit to Hanoi and we have explored it on several occasions and find something new or different views each time.It forms a junction point between the Old and French quarters so great point to orient yourself by."

The track around the lake is a constant procession of people walking and jogging - the men often with their singlets rolled up around their chests - and the roadway is a 24 hour sea of vehicles, mostly motor scooters.

Hoan Kiem Lake is a must-see attraction that needn't take much time to explore if you're pressed, but can be a lovely place to take a break and escape from Hanoi's tumult. It's a beautiful, man-made lake in the Old Quarter, near the French Quarter, and close to many top hotels, cafes, restaurants, and shops. It's a free and memorable attraction (though there is a fee to access the shrine, this is optional) and while it's beautiful at any time of day, in hot weather mornings are especially nice, before the city fully heats up. It's relaxing to stroll or sit near the lake as a way to avoid traffic, though the occasional motor bike (or regular bike) may appear on the foot-path in the ring of park that surrounds the lake.If you're staying in another district it's easy to combine a visit to this lake with a trip to the Water Puppet Theater and an ice-cream or ice-pop from one of the stands selling refreshments near the top of the lake (the side nearest The Huc Bridge). The shrine featuring the large stuffed turtle are also worth a visit. We enjoyed seeing couples in wedding attire having photos taken on and near the bridge and around the lake - it is among Hanoi's most picturesque attractions."

At night it is surrounded by families and couples enjoying the space. Various kinds of shops, restaurants or buildings can be found alongside it. If you are in Hanoi you must go.

A fair sized expanse (about size of MCG) with a main street running the whole perimeter: that road converged with one of the busiest intersections in Hanoi and it is a feat to cross the traffic for the first time: wait for 'relative' calm, use the crossing and watch the oncoming traffic and commit - watch the horde of motorbikes and proceed carefully - they will avoid you (by some intuition/miracle), head north for some very interesting shopping (try pots and pans street if you like to watch cottage industry at its best).

The entrance via the bridge will lead you to a Chinese temple. The calm water in the lake provides a serene atmosphere and many people loves to hang around the lake from evening, usually around 5pm till 9pm. According to the local, once upon a time, there was an emperor and the country was invaded by enemies. The country was doomed and in order to win the war, the emperor required to retrieve a magic sword from the mouth of a giant turtle. He prayed to god to give him the strength and luck to pull the sword from the giant turtle. Eventually, he managed to retrieve the sword and he used it to fight his enemies. He was able to kill thousands of his enemies and protect his kingdom. As a promised, he returned the sword by placing it onto the mouth of the giant turtle, and the lake was named as Hoan Kiem Lake, meaning Return Sword Lake...literally. Great place to have your evening walk....don't miss it if you go Hanoi."

It's a great place and time for people watching. During the day, the lake side is also full of activity, plenty of wedding couples having their portraits taken or just visitors strolling. Also great for people watching. At night, the temple, bridge and Turtle Tower is lighted up beautifully and perfect for night time photography."

The other is the red bridge leading to the Jade Temple on a small island in the middle of the lake. The temple is a great place to calm down and get your bearings when you first arrive in the city.

I walked round this beautiful lake soon after I arrived in Hanoi, and enjoyed the calm and relaxed surroundings after the minefield of crossing the streets to get there - those scooters are a cultural experiences in themselves! Many Vietnamese congregate around the lake for one reason or another, whether to chat, relax on a bench or even have their wedding photos take with the famous Turtle Tower as a back drop. It is quite a large lake, and would take a couple of hours to wander right the way round, especially as there are plenty of things to stop and look at along the way - young boys playing football with what looked like a a shuttle cock, historic monuments and even a place where you could have your portrait sketched. So, a lovely setting and a great place to people watch and get a feel for Vietnam and the Vietnamese.If this review is helpful then please indicate so below."

To the west there is an old temple, you have to cross the road to get to it.

The lake is green and has plenty of fish, which occasionally jump out of the water catching insects. It's a nice spot to sit and soak in the chaos of Hanoi whilst enjoying the lake and surrounds.

The lake is lit with colorful spotlights on the temple in the center island and the bridge along one side (night also obscures how rundown the temple in the center of the lake looks during the day). I didn't see any signage explaining the history, but just being there and strolling and enjoying the view was fun. It would be a great spot for people watching.There are people walking dogs, dance classes playing music and sambaing in circles, couples strolling, teens on scooters scaring everyone on the sidewalk, bicycles everywhere, skaters on a plaza with lots of concrete across the street from the lake, cafes, bars.... You can sit on a bench if you find a free one, but it's pretty crowded. I see other reviews that describe this place as relaxing, but I don't really agree. There's too much going on, too much electricity, noise, life, and clamor. We walked by the lake several times during the day, and it wasn't the same, certainly, but the traffic and the urban feel and pace weren't very relaxing, even midday. I'd say it feels very energetic.It was fun. If you're in Hanoi and you don't spend at least one evening strolling around the lake, you're missing out."

The scenery constantly changes - the colours change with the weather and time of day. There is the contrast in traffic between day and night - when the street is relatively quiet to peak traffic periods. The outfits that people wear on motor scooters also change with time of day. Activities around the lake also change - tai chi and aerobics in the morning, dance groups, people walking dogs or jogging, the corner where the boys skate; so much to see. For a fee you can walk across the red bridge. The gardens are well maintained and can be admired. And there are several Cafes and kiosks from which you can purchase a drink or something to eat.

The night view with all the lights reflecting of the water gives a dramatic and different feel than day time. The local guide told us that the lake has a historic legend: during the 15th century, Vietnam revolted against its its Chinese overlord in the Ming Dynasty. A local Dragon god gave Vietnamese Emperor Loi a magic sword to help with the fight. Once the Chinese was repelled, a turtle surfaced asking Loi for the sword back. Hoan Kiem Lake in Vietnamese, Hoan means return (restored), Kiem means sword. Obviously not the original, but there are still a number of large, old turtles in the lake. There is a temple, red bridge, and tower on site."

The story of the giant turtle who just passed away is now even better than when you had to try yet fail to spot him! The temple on the little island is a good example of real people worshiping in a way not familiar to many tourists, but take the time to read up and understand what is going on, and how the influences in Vietnamese culture are Chinese yet this is distinctly not China!

But walk around in about 20min.It has a temple for about $30000 dong, approx $2 Au to get in and see a giant preserved title as well, not really worth it.It had its own Venice beach, locals lifting free weights, tai chi, dancers etc. you can see some other hotels etc as you walk around for food or drinks you may like.Early morning, tai chi, badminton, futsal, a massive aerobics group in a park as we walked around to name a few.Our teenagers were approached by young locals to practice their English, our kids loved this and seems common as you walk around.A nice flat walk, see the locals in action, keep to the shade."

There is a temple you can go into for 30 000d but if you've seen one temple you've seen them all. In the middle of the lake is a shell of a building called Turtle Tower. The only disappointment is none of the signs around the lake are written in both languages so you cannot read about the attraction. Trees align the pathways, you can join ladies doing their morning exercises, a large garden clock surround by flowers and garden beds filled with lily or a type of daisy.The road around the park is very wide so if you cross the it to go to the shops just be careful of the chaotic Hanoi traffic. Along the way there are stores selling drinks and ice cream along with WC. The good thing is it is free unless you go see the temple."

On our route back round to the hotel we stopped for lunch at a lovely tiny little local cafe on Truc Bach where we enjoyed a lovely drink and some really fantastic local food for a tiny amount of money.

Of course, allows you to recharge yourself to head back into the organized chaos"

I was lucky when wandering around the lake, then being order to try an app named Hanoi Audio Guide by a group of start-up team with 3 lovely Vietnamese girls. This app will lead a solo traveller like me to explore the Old Quarter like a local, even without a tour guide. I tried for free with Ngoc Son Shrine and it was very useful. It would be a miss for me if I didn't use the app. I know about the legendary story of the lake, the meaning of the horse and the bird inside the shrine."

The lake has areas for seating around and grass. It's pretty having trees, grass etc in the city, and not just concrete building. The lake is popular place for local people also, it seems especially on the weekends - so that can give you a better insight in some of the life around the city. Hanoi is very busy and traffic always flowing, but here is a relaxing place if you turn your back on the traffic and just walk on the walks/sidewalks, area around the lake. There is a nice breeze coming off the lake at times and you can sit and enjoy it. There are people of all ages enjoying the area. Some sitting, drawing, talking, walking, some exercising, even with weights in one area in the early evening. At night the lights around are nice to see.

While peaceful & serene during the day at night it turns into a magical sight to behold as the colored lights turns the lake into a fairyland. There are numerous restaurant & Coffee bars along side the lake that lend themselves to an enjoyable break from the never ending hustle & bustle of a busy city. There are adequate seating around the lake where you can spend time enjoying the scenery, or if you are up early you can join in with all the locals doing Ti Chi or in some cases Yoga, even seen a couple doing Martial arts with real swords. The lake itself is known to the locals as the lake of the magic Turtle Gods, & there is a legend where it is said that two warring tribes were constantly warring with each other until one day the turtle Gods had enough so they summoned the two tribes to the edge of the lake & ordered them to throw their sword into the deepest part of the lake. After they all complied the head turtle told them to go back to their villages & live in peace! Now I don't know how much truth is in the legend, but there is still enough child in this old man to hope there some truth in this story, as even today we can learn a lot from the magic turtle Gods about living together in peace & harmony. You will also find the people to be genuinely friendly & very helpful & you can get around Hanoi without any fear from crime, as it is very well Policed, day & night. Actually this can be said of all Vietnam, as it's a very friendly country. Friday & Saturday nights a lot of downtown Hanoi is blocked off to traffic by police barricades that are also manned by the friendly police force & only pedestrians are allowed in these areas. It's great seeing all the kids come out & play games in the streets..Go there, you will love the carefree lifestyle."

It seems perfectly normal to enjoy all of these activities out in the open. An added bonus to getting up early is to see the street action in the old quarter as fruits, vegetables, and flowers are making their way to their spot to be sold. I could do this every morning. Always something unique to see."

Best time to walk around and not be hassled is early in the morning or late at night when there are less people. It's a nice sight at night but there's nothing to really draw you there. If you do go make sure you keep your belongings in sight, in front of you and put your hands in your pockets. I read a lot about pickpockets here and thought it must be an exaggeration but sure enough, first time I walked around it, they were there. If a bloke comes up to you with his mate, with a camera and wants a photo with you push him away, he's a pickpocket. If someone continually hassles you to buy things, walk away, they're a pickpocket. If well dressed ladies surround you, hold your things close and walk away, they're pickpockets."

If you just take bus from the international airport and wonder how you can move to the lake which nearby have many hotels for your trip in HanoiThere are 2 kinds of bus from the airport. You take red and yellow bus mean the last stop is by the Thong Nhat park ( Cong vien in Vietnamese) in Tran Nhan Tong street, then you just walk few step in same side to over the park's gate and wait for number 9 bus ( only 7000 dong or 30 cents). This number 9 bus will take you to the lake as its last stopIf you take other bus by private owner which will take you to Quang Trung street is last stop. From this stop you also walk to the lake in 10 minutes also Wish you best luck"

Women doing group salsa routines, older women doing tai chi with fans, men weight-lifting - it was very memorable. The lake itself is pretty, surrounded by a well-kept park and sidewalks. A picturesque ruined temple sits at one end, and another temple is at the other end accessible by bridge (and an admission charge).It feels like the heart of Hanoi, and it's a great place to people-watch. A warning - one time we went on a weekend afternoon, and we were approached by 2 groups of college students who wanted to practice their English skills. They were delightful of course. But if you want to be left alone, you might not want to sit down :)2 thumbs up!"

L\u1ee3i concluded that Kim Qui had come to reclaim the sword that its master, a local God, the Dragon King (Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng) had given L\u1ee3i some time earlier, during his revolt against Ming China. L\u1ee3i renamed the lake to commemorate this event, from its former name Luc Thuy meaning \"Green Water\". The Turtle Tower (Thap R\u00f9a) standing on a small island near the centre of lake is linked to the legend. \""

The gardens around the lake were especially beautiful and it seemed like everyone was out and about, enjoying this lovely area. After my ride, I then walked back along half of the lake to take many photos. Be careful crossing the roads around this area. I don't think I have ever been so scared crossing a road before and the first time, I screamed the whole way across. Apparently the secret is to just walk and don't stop until you get to the other side - and don't look at what's coming towards you. Trust that the traffic will miss you and it will. Or be like me and wait until some locals start to cross then cross with them, making sure they are on the side which will get hit first, if there's an accident! It worked for me!!!"

The air-conditioned night express coach I took was a comfortably clean one and the unique narrow bunk surprisingly fit me well. Despite the driver's irritating incessant horning, the journey was a smooth one and I had my intermittent deep naps throughout the 14-hr long bus trip. It was the longest bus journey I had ever embarked but I found fun and joy in the night ride and in having my two ears flooded with pulsating disco Vietnamese music and love songs. It is natural that some will react towards the new stimulus with a hostile mindset but I am quite adaptable and my mind can easily switch to a different channel to adapt to this new environment and culture. If you are in Rome do as Romans do. Upon reaching Hanoi, I passed by a number of lakes but the moment I stepped into the park of this Lake of the Restored Sword, I could feel her difference from the rest. Bright colorful flowers dotted the park. Couples sitting intimately on benches occasionally hugging and giggling to each other while some took their seats in the caf\u00e9 nearby sipping their coffee in their relaxed mood while occasionally extend their gaze to the calm and serene lake. I stared at the `little hut' in the middle of the lake. The isolated hut in the expanse of the calm lake looks distinctively tiny but it adds a mesmerizing appeal to this lake. The wind was cool and the ambience and setting deliver a different sort of taste. I strolled my way round the lake stop for a while at the entrance to the pagoda temple took some photos and continued my walk. The lake is serene and lovely. The long branches of the year old trees stretch their prowess and cast a mysterious stint to the lake scenery. At one corner of the lake, a crowd gathered around a group of four graceful tall young female musicians donned in long red dress playing lovely tunes on their violins. Further down the lane, I met models attired in beautiful `ao dai' ( the traditional Vietnamese costume) having their photography by the lake. I sat down on a bench set my gaze at the lake enjoying the serenity of the surrounding when a few young university girls suddenly interrupted my relaxation and strike casual conversation with me. They were honestly keen to learn English from me. I found them sincere and we had a good exchange. I traveled alone to this foreign country and hardly can converse a single words in the language of this country. I looked lost ,isolated and abandoned. But at this lakeside, in the cool weather and serenity of the surroundings, I felt the affection, warmth and friendliness from these young lovely university students. In simple dribs and drabs, they tried to understand me and I tried to understand them. We laughed and when I was too fast in my pace, they requested me to slow down. We shared our face book and added each other to continue our friendship journey. We took a good photo before we departed. Today, while I am writing, their faces vividly appear in front of me and they are also now my face book friends.Cool weather, nice ambience and my lovely friends. The Lake was our friendship bridge."

A lovely calming way to spend some time away from the narrow streets and constant assault on the senses that you get from staying in the Old Quarter. The temple/pagoda is worth a visit, cross the red bridge to get there. There is an entrance fee, I forget how much but not exorbitant from memory. A walking path that is not full of motorbikes, and at night, festooned by overhead fairy lights makes it a worth seeing in the day and in the night. Also plenty to see and do nearby, especially around the huge intersection where it butts to the old quarter party streets.Find your way there."

It's not that big so comfortable to stroll around, Early morning, by which mean about 6.30-7.30am you see the locals doing Tai Chi, Badminton and Dance classes so quite atmospheric. During the day it's a respite from the Hanoi motor traffic (albeit this is on the roads next to you) and in evening the wide promenade is brightly lit up and you can see local couples enjoying some time gazing out across the lake - probably best tome for this as the water in daytime is filthy - no idea how the Turtle (you must get someone to explain the history of this) survived in there."

Dead fish being collected by workers is an all-too-common sight nobody wants to see... But I'm sure they'll eventually cotton on to the fact that any large body of still water needs regeneration. Aeration by another name. However, if you lift your eyes away from the murk, the whole area is a restful break from the frantic rush of traffic.Still, if you stop (anywhere!) you risk being pounced on by (everyone?) wanting to praise their English. Enthusiastic young students especially. Enjoy the experience by asking any questions you might have about Vietnam. Their answers always cover the whole spectrum, so everyone gains. Ok, back to the Lake...The walkaround itself is more like a botanical garden, with shady trees, seasonal flowers and creatively pruned shrubs to admire. The odd information and ice-cream kiosks keep everyone happy, not just the kids... Yes, there are WC's too...But the Lake itself remains the attraction, giving a meditative ambience for a quiet, reflective break from the bustle. Avoid on the weekends; too crowded!The bridge might be too commercial for all tastes, but offers excellent photo views and overall the total experience is one that should not be missed. Enjoy the peaceful surrounds while you can. Plenty of other 'necessities' close by with Supermarkets on both sides, Post Office, Hospitals, Cathedrals and Twin Towers to keep you occupied. A good cross-section of fast-food outlets on the Western side (where else?) will satisfy the cravings... Still plenty of shops to check out too!Enjoy!"

There's also the made in vietnam outlets selling 'Nike, Adidas and North Face' shirts, jackets, trainers and bags...Pity the city couldn't corral these places and put them in a market somewhere, it works great in HCMC with 'Saigon Square'.Read up on the streets surrounding the lake, easy walking distance to some great French colonial era cathedral (St. Joseph's) and what's left of the 'Hanoi Hilton' (not much).I'd have thought they would have kept this site complete as a museum but maybe the most recent history isn't something the authorities would like to dwell on."

You can walk across the Huc Bridge (wooden bridge painted red) to the island at the centre of the lake for 30,000VND. At night you get a pretty good view of the city lights from the centre of the bridge. There are a few stalls selling the 3D cards.. Don't buy them here, they are cheaper at the night market.If you like to run for exercise, this is the place to go. Hanoi isn't really a runner-friendly city so you'll see a lot of locals running around the lake. We were there on a Saturday and there were also a lot of weddings. We didn't see any turtles though. Apparently the last one recently passed away :("

Visited the Lake of the Restored Sword (Hoan Kiem Lake) with friends on the way to the temple in the middle of the lake, which is unimpressive, however the pictures you can get on the bridge are great. Plus there are nice bars and restaurants around the lake if you need refreshments. You can also see turtle tower in the middle of the lake and this is explained in the legend surrounding the lake, as well as explaining its name. According to the legend, (or should I say according to Wikipedia) in early 1428, Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was boating on the lake when a Golden Turtle God (Kim Qui) surfaced and asked for his magic sword, Heaven's Will. L\u1ee3i concluded that Kim Qui had come to reclaim the sword that its master, a local God, the Dragon King (Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng) had given L\u1ee3i some time earlier, during his revolt against Ming China. L\u1ee3i renamed the lake to commemorate this event, from its former name Luc Thuy meaning \"Green Water\". The Turtle Tower (Thap R\u00f9a) standing on a small island near the centre of lake is linked to the legend. Depending on the weather I would advise taking: Sun Screen, Water, Camera, Hat or Umbrella."

Ensure to bargain, as most are being sold to tourists with a higher price than with locals.TIP: Do not buy from the ladies carrying a plastic basket selling bread.

There are the usual food and trinket vendors, but the sidewalks are wide and there\u2019s plenty of room for strolling under the ancient shady trees. There are a couple of pagodas on the lake, one that you can reach by a bridge. At night the bridge, pagodas and trees are beautifully lit up. A nice nearby stop is Fanny\u2019s, an ice-cream shop near the north end of the lake where you can take a break in the air conditioning and choose from dozens of exotic flavors. Also nearby is the Thanh Long Water Puppet Theater, so if you have time before the performance, the lake is a relaxing family-oriented place to hang out."

After a while they all begin to merge in your memory .Thats how l felt until l came here But Yes ! You will remember this Temple because it owes its existence to a Magic Turtle . The Kingdom was at risk ,the enemy were battering at the gates and all seemed lost for the brave Prince as he faced almost certain defeat .When ,as if by magic ( and l privately think it probably was Magic ) a magic Turtle rose up from the depths of this lake and on its back was a magic sword which it gave to the Prince. Freshly Armed and Full of Magic Enthusiasm the brave Prince drove the enemies of Vietnam far away (Cambodia ) and everyone except the Turtle lived happily ever after .. Why was the Turtle unhappy you might ask well maybe it knew that it would eventually die in the far distant future - 1967 and end up as a (rather badly ) stuffed turtle in this very temple . It's different you must surely admit and therefore Very Memorable .You will not forget this Temple l prophecy ! I haven't !"

Here, incense smoke drifts in the air and locals pray.

Legend is that the Emperor was boating on the lake when a gold turtle appeared and asked for his magic sword. The Turtle Tower is linked to this legend and stands on a small island in the lake reached by a small bridge. The lake is an area of great activity with many cafes and restaurants, street vendors and people. It is possible to walk around the lake and there are some beautiful flower beds and displays. We visited Hanoi during the Vietnamese New Year and the place was heaving both during the day and at night. It may be quieter at other times. The walkway was lit up at night which gave it a very different feel. A definite must when visiting Hanoi."

Our hotel was just around the corner from the lake so we took advantage of the location to walk around it several times each day during our stay. The lights on the lake were beautiful at night with the shimmering reflections and colours. But apart from its scenic qualities the lake also provided us a constant stream of entertainment from the spectacular lion dance parade in preparation for Tet to the scores of Hanoi locals going through their varied exercise routines. I loved the energetic zumba ladies spread out along a busy corner undeterred by the manic traffic rushing past as they sashayed through their moves. My favourite though, was the elderly gentleman teaching a couple of lucky ladies to Tango. He looked so suave and dapper in his suit and hat it was hard not to ask if I could join in."

Dancing, keep fit, a concert! Young boys and girls hanging out and having fun, street food being cooked and sold, the sights and sounds were amazing! The lights around the lake are really well done.

Right after check in, I on my google map and want to come here for a jog after many hours sitting on plane. I really like here because it is a nice place to jog. I came here in afternoon and evening several times before. The scene I see are different. There are temples and status where I will capture some of the scenery as I jog. During evening time, the lake bridge will light up beautifully and feel happy to see the daily life of hanoi people. children are playing, couples are strolling the park, old folks are chatting, groups are gathering to do workout. It is a great place to sit down and talk too, especially when it is winter time, i really enjoy the breeze, relaxing the lake view and chat. Well I feel it is good for jogger, and people who enjoy walking at park. Quite difficult to carry camera because the distance are wide. So I take my phone camera trying to capture some beautiful scene.Enjoy"

The lake of the restored sword got its name after a legend: the emperor LeLoi had been given a sword by a local god to fight against the Chinese. The sword worked its magic when the Chinese were defeated. The emperor was in a boat on the lake when a turtle came towards the boat. The turtle grabbed the sword and disappeared, the emperor could find neither the turtle nor the sword. He concluded that the sword had been given to him to fight the enemy and that there was no further need for the sword as the country was free. The emperor changed the name of the lake (which was called the lake of the green water) to its present name, the lake of the restored sword.

The pagoda and red bridge is a picture worthy place. When you are exploring, you can use this lake as your bearing when you get lost or trying to locate a place. This is a must visit, must see in Hanoi. A place you can chill and watch the world slowly go by"

In the evening people go for a run or a stroll to enjoy the evening air. At night, the lights reflect on the water and lighten the walking paths that surround the lake. Under the trees during summer can be a welcome respite from the heat. If you are lucky you can see the large turtle that inhabits the lake. I have seen it a number of times. You can buy an ice cream and sit on a bench to enjoy the sights people passing or the quiet reflection of trees in the water. During wedding season you can see couples having their photos taken. There is so much happening every day. Walking all of the way around takes about 40 minutes but there are so many things to see nearby that it may take a lot longer. However, it is possible to walk part of the way around and come back to finish it later. And there are lots of opportunities for lovely scenic photos of the lake.It is close to the Old Quarter where there are many hotels, restaurants and cafes and shopping for tourists. At the lake near the Water Puppets for a small fee you can take an electric bus ride of the Old Quarter. There are a couple of cafes on the lake side where you can stop for a refreshment and rest. On the lake is a temple with access by a small bridge, This too is well worth a visit and te cost is small.A walk around the lake can quickly become a favourite activity."

On early mornings, you will get to see many of the people doing their own exercises - whether solo or in groups, whether some vigorous martial-arts looking moves or energetic dancing from women.During the day, since the lake is surrounded by all sides with buildings, if you are on the side of the Old Quarter, then it never ceases to be busy as many tourists and local people pass by in order to shop or maybe just even enjoy a cup of coffee along the numerous cafes dotting its side. If you are in the area for a water puppet show, by the time you come out of the theater, you will still see people going about their business - whether vendors hawking their wares, people just enjoying the breeze or using the lake as a jump off point to the many points of interests within walking distance from the shore.There's also the Turtle Tower in the center of the lake. You can't get to it, but if you are a typical tourist, its always a good background for your souvenir photo.Another structure on the lake is the Temple of the Jade Mountain located on Jade Island - it is near the northern shore of the lake and is connected to it by a red, wooden bridge which is another place to stop and pose for pictures.Whether its to enjoy nature, people watch or just be a typical tourist of Hanoi, visit one of the most popular lakes in this city."

As I mentioned in some other reviews the air quality of Hanoi is still a problem due to the excessive motorcycles, what a shame since the landscape is really smoggy due to this.I think that the magic of the lake lies within not only its picturesque quality, but also the legend behind. It's believed that during the 15th century emperor Le visited this lake and received a sword from a gigantic turtle, with which the emperor fought off the Ming dynasty invaders to retain the independence of Vietnam. The sword was then returned to the turtle by the emperor upon a second visit for a full circle ending. Hence the name of the lake literally means \"restored sword lake\". The turtle is sacred and was regarded by zoologists as a cryptid.At a surprising turn of the story, the animal is real and during the mid century it was spotted and unfortunately killed by a local fisherman. It's corpse has since been preserved and displayed at the Temple of the Jade Mountain at the lake opened for the public. There is another turtle and has since been spotted and conserved by the local government and scientists. The turtle belongs to a soft shell turtle family called the Yangtze Softshell Turtle, a highly endangered animal with only 4 live specimens in the world including this one in the lake.If you are lucky you could spot this legendary turtle during your visit (I was not), but be a responsible tourist and do not throw garbage to further pollute the already fragile environment of the lake.Also pay a visit to the Thang Long water puppet theatre to enjoy the traditional Vietnamese performance, in which a version of the lake's legend is told.Such a magical story at the heart of a busy city, I truly hope this could be preserved during the process of hyper urbanization and industrialization. Peace out."

Hope it is fed well by the temple managers but I doubt it.The shop has some products that are slightly different from the street merchants but not so much that you want to blow all your money there. Like all attractions here, they need to smarten up their tourist merchandise and differentiate from the street products, particularly as there are many discerning international travellers visiting from sophisticated markets.Worth going?

My family and I had a nice, leisurely stroll around the lake on our first night in Hanoi, after dinner. It took us about 40 minutes to circle the whole lake, though we were walking quite slowly and stopped to take photos. The lake was nicely lit up with Christmas lights, and was a good spot to take photos. You will be able to see attractions like the small Bo Tien Temple, Turtle Tower and the Huc Bridge, though I wouldn't say they were particularly breathtaking. Strolling around the lake is a good way to catch the array of activities that the locals engage in. We saw many groups exercising, dancing and working out when we were at the lake. Hoan Kiem Lake is located in close proximity to the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre, so you can enjoy your stroll along the lake after or before you catch the water puppet display."

People gathered day and night to meet, eat and play badminton on the footpath. The traffic here is the same as anywhere in Hanoi \u2013 frenetic. This was our first real experience crossing the road, and even using a pedestrian crossing, it is an interesting experience. But, eyes front and keep walking. The abundance of mopeds will weave around you.The first thing we encountered approaching the lake was the statue of Emperor Ly Thai To. Apparently legend has him provided with a magical sword that he used to drive the Chinese out of Vietnam in the 15th century. This leads to the other name the lake is known by: Lake of the Restored Sword.This was my first attempt at photography in Hanoi and I learnt early to have the camera on and the lens cover off to allow the humidity to evaporate from the lens!There are a few photographic opportunities around the lake, including the lake itself and Turtle Tower perched on a small island. Also in the middle of the lake is another small island, atop which sits a pagoda known as the Ngoc Son Temple. As we posed on the red bridge, we met some young Vietnamese students who asked us if they could practice their English with us as part of their university studies. From here, you can wander up to the bustling market area around Hang Gai Street in about 20 minutes and experience the real Hanoi \u2013 frantic, bustling, and ready to sell."

Visitors can't hope to understand its significance: it's of course a must-visit destination. It's beautiful too, although you won't hear it mentioned in the same breath as Hangzhou's West Lake. Someone on a UK message board describes it as a big pond: You have to contend with hoards of strollers and people doing their morning calesthenics, as well the air quality is bad. Don't trip over the beggars and hawkers, either. (I don't believe this journalistic exaggeration.)One can't describe the lake, and the 1.5km paths surrounding it, an oasis either. Try sit on a bench, soak in the water expanse, close your eyes. You hear the drone of motorcycles and the incessant honking. I believe though that, after a few moments of doing that, you just may get a sense of how Hanoians see this lake. Company with friends, or meditation amidst the bustle, it's a privilege few foreign visitors will enjoy. Tourists, especially if they look native English-speaking, can't escape being accosted by students who want to practise their English.I try and stay near the lake so I can enjoy walking here."

Most of the exercises are graceful and appear to be directed at becoming more supple and include group dancing, sword dances and many individual contributions.

Be wary of PICKPOCKETS in the area! Some guy tried to pester us (almost pushing us) by selling the Vietnamese cut-out greeting card, while another guy he was with was reaching into our bag. Thankfully my husband was alert and noticed. The guy was already holding one of our belongings and had no choice but to hand it over to my husband and \"pretend\" it dropped out of our bag. He quickly walked away. Sneaky indeed! The men pretended that they did not know each other. After a few minutes, we same them again standing around 15-20 meters apart. My husband tried to take a photo of the man who was selling us the cut out card. He noticed the camera, then he used his mobile phone to call. Lo and be hold, we saw the guy who took our stuff pick up a call from his phone. They instantly started walking away from the Hoan Kiem Lake in separate directions. ====The temple is small but has a good view of the lake. A stuffed giant turtle is on display.

Around the lake are many small places to eat or shop, and the Water Puppet Theatre is just across the street. If you're in Hanoi you must check out the Lake if only for a few minutes."

The lake offers you a motor bike free area. It's around 1.2 k per lap. You will have to run around a lot of people but it not to bad. I run in the evening and morning.

The lake is considered the center of Hanoi, not only physically but also symbolically. In fact, the more you spend time learning about the lake, the more special it becomes.he lake is not only special in her history. The water color of Hoan Kiem Lake is not commonly found in other lakes elsewhere in the country: greenish, with dark or light shade depending on the reflection of the sky. The lake is full of tortoise, which is second to none to be found among Vietnamese lakes. If you are lucky, you will catch sight of these giant animals rising out of water. And because tortoise is considered a sacred animal in Vietnam\u2019s culture (along with dragon, phoenix and unicorn), Hoan Kiem Lake then become a holy place that nurtures tortoise."

A walk around the lake is not taxing, just relaxing. Go in the evening, when the locals are out in force, winding down after their hard day's work."

Only problem is the difficulty in getting across the busy roads but we managed to walk right around the lake 3 times while we were visiting Hanoi and it was worth it. We saw two couples in their wedding clothes having photos taken, men having a sleep in the heat, lots of locals enjoying the scene, and the vegetation was pretty. At night it is particularly appealing as a quiet place to stroll."

You will find many park benches to sit on and have a great conversation with your company, as well as random people who will come up and exchange a smile and perhaps a small pleasantry with you. We basically walked along the edge of the lake every night on our way back to our hotel from wherever we were and would get a Bia Hanoi and sit there and reflect back on the events from the day and night. The first night in Hanoi we actually got a Ban Mi sandwich and a few beers and sat there and ate and drank and took in the sound and sight of the city. I fell in love with the city from the very first moment we walked around Hoan Kiem Lake and saw the pagoda in the middle of the lake and the small temple all lit up at the edge of the water with a small, yet beautiful bridge connecting the temple to the land. You will most likely see many people exercising, young people having a picnic, and even people paying their most reverent respects to the altar near the temple. I really enjoyed being able to observe the life of the city as we took a moment to take a break from it and just live in the serene moment."

If you survive your introduction by fire to the tsunami of traffic, chaos and noise that is H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, you can walk around the Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake. It is a dynamic daily tableau, from morning walks amid locals doing exercises on the shore, to young couples water-gazing on park benches, to the multiple shopping and sight-seeing opportunities in the vicinity. Centrally located in the city, Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm Lake serves as a home base for most tourists, and provides endless people-watching and recreational opportunities on the edge of the Old Quarter. You can do nothing and see the best of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i at the lake. Its even more interesting if you know the histroy. The Emperor L\u00eaL\u1ee3i came to power after revolting against the Chinese Ming Dynasty. A local God, the Dragon King \u2018Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng\u2019 gave L\u1ee3i a magic sword, Heaven's Will which ensured his defeat over the Chinese. Later Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was boating of the Green water lake, \u2018Luc Thuy\u2019 when a Golden Turtle God (Kim Qui) surfaced and asked for the return of his magic sword. L\u1ee3i renamed the lake to commemorate the event. Turtle Tower (Thap R\u00f9a) standing on a small island near the center of lake is linked to the legend. head around the lake visiting various sites Sites around the lake including Indra Gandhi Park with the massive bronze statue of Ly Thai To (founder and first king of the Ly Dynasty) dominates the entrance, he reigned from 1009 to 1028 AD. It was he who moved the capital to H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i in 1010. On your walk around the lake (other side end) you may see Fannies 48 Le Thai To, if so stop and try the young rice ice cream. Hai c\u1ea3m \u01a1n. It has a cult following. Trang Tien ice-cream, uses natural ingredients to make a \u201cfresh-tasting\u201d product open until 10:00pm. Head to the northern shore of the lake, to Jade Island, where the Temple of the Jade Mountain (Ngoc Son) stands. Erected in the 18th century to honour the 13th-century military leader Tran Hung Dao who distinguished himself in the fight against the Yuan Dynasty, Van Xuong, a scholar, and Nguyen Van Sieu, a Confucian master and famous writer in charge of repairs made to the temple in 1864. It was Tran Hung Dao who invented the spikes in the pit and rotating spikes defences that were used by peasants to initially hold back 3 different Mongol invasions, later the Chinese and American invasions. The Emperor posthumously bestowed Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o the title of \"H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o \u0110\u1ea1i V\u01b0\u01a1ng\" (Great Lord H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o). Approach by the wooden red-painted Huc Bridge, meaning Morning Sunlight Bridge. A small museum on Jade Island holds the second to last large soft-shell turtle, of the species Rafetus leloii in honor of the emperor. At least one has been sighted in the lake. This individual affectionately known as C\u1ee5 R\u00f9a, meaning \u2018Great Grandfather Turtle\u2019 enjoys this popular lake almost as much as countless locals and tourists. On June 2, 1967, a Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm turtle died from injuries caused by an abusive fisherman that was ordered to net the turtle, but instead hit the turtle with a crowbar. The turtle was preserved and placed on display in the temple. That particular specimen weighed 200 kg and measured 1.9m long. Until that time, no one was sure if the species still lived. The species is critically endangered and the number of individuals in the lake is unclear. The lake is clean enough for freshwater crabs to be common."

You can cross the Hoan Kiem Lake bridge, have a bite to eat at the surrounding caf\u00e9, talk to the locals or just relax and visualise the emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i while boating on the lake when a Golden Turtle God (Kim Qui) surfaced and asked for his magic sword (according to legend).

At first glance, I felt that the Hoan Kiem Lake - albeit beautiful and calm - seemed to be a little overrated compared to pictures in travel guides and the Internet.However a stroll along the perimeter of the Lake proved me otherwise; little by little. Monuments, structures, and the famous red bridge that leads you to the Ngoc Son Temple are just mini surprises that you will see along your journey. Keep your eyes peeled for both things you see on the Lake and around you, on the shore and just your surroundings. It is amazing that the Old Quarter area, with its busy hustle and bustle, would feature such a serene and calm place amidst.As such, don't be quick to judge. If you have the time, do take a leisurely walk around and check out the Lake at night too! The colours and lights will blow you away."

Tales of ancient turtles (or tortoises) appearing from the green waters of the lake with retrieved swords of legendary rulers lend a rich and exciting colour to the area. The surrounds of the lake are well kept gardens with huge old trees where the local population congregate particularly in the mornings and evenings for excercise or just the romantic or casual stroll in this beautiful environment. An old vietnamese estate and temple is perched on an island across a narrow bridge into the corner of the lake and offers some interesting sights for the sightseers. As a popular meeting spot close to other tourist areas, coffee and tea houses and restaurants abound here and it's easy to find a relaxing perch to watch the world go by or perhaps even spot the fabled turtle breaching the serene lake surface?! For those who want to learn more about the ancient stories a visit to the nearby water puppet theatre is a must."

In the evening, I did not feel that the attention was evident though. The Lake has much history which is worthwhile reading about. There are many restuarants/bars adjacent to the lake, particularly at the Northern side of the lake. Definitely can't go to Hanoi without visiting Hoan Kiem Lake."

There are a lot of hawkers who may approach you whilst walking around the lake so be mindful of this. The best thing I found was to get up early one morning and go down to the lake's edge to watch th locals exercise. We got there before 6.30 and there was still lots to see but some people we passed on the streets were clearly walking back from having finished their exercise. We saw lots of people doing tai chi and dancing and the funniest thing was a huge group doing Gangnam Style. We're talking about women who are 50+ which is what makes it so interesting.

We also grabbed a tuck tuck (bike) driver for an hour ride around the city...fabulous! We paid too much, $9.00 for the two of us, however it was worth it (costs a lot more for something similar in Western Europe). Our driver was super nice, informative, and funny. He took great care of us, even covered the front when the rain got a bit heavy. Bottom line...head to the lake and enjoy some Hanoi experiences you will remember."

A great place to relax around at any time of the day however, with island temple of Ngoc Son at one end and the Turtle Tower at the other end. A couple of k's to circumvent and at the bottom you can branch off into the French quarter or rest at the lakeside cafe/bar and people watch. Soft-shelled giant turtles still exist there and it is a good omen if you spot one. The legend has it that when the country was occupied by the Chinese in the 15th century, Le Loi, a resistance leader, caught a splendid sword when fishing there and it assisted his victory over the Chinese. Later, as Emperor Le Thai To, he rowed across the lake to return it when with a clap of thunder a golden \u2018tortoise\u2019 popped up to take it from his hand. It is said the turtles will be there again in times of national peril. (Think King Arthur and the Ravens of the Tower...)A very imposing statue of To in a square can be seen on the opposite side of the road leading alongside the lake on the way to the french quarter. Just before you reach it there some savvy female street money changers"

I love visiting Hoan Kiem Lake as it's a really good way to gain insight into Vietnamese culture - if you go the the Water Puppet theater, one of the skits will make more sense if you've already visited Cua Rua (the giant turtle) at Hoan Kiem. Has been repainted since last I visited (2012) and is a good place to have a rest if you're overheated."

I would advise anyone to go early in the morning.... 5.30 to 6.00 and see everyone exercising around the lake. Its a fantastic scene. Join in the tai chi, the dancing, the jogging, power walking etc, then have a coffee a rest then back to your hotel for breakfast. See the street sellers getting ready on some of the streets on the western side of the lake. Loading up bikes, carrying sticks, selling from small stalls by the pavement. A scene full of colour, energy and commerce and one which you could have seen years ago. Buy a mango, have a piece of watermelon or join the locals for a great bowl of Pho. We went there twice and would wander around again. ."

On the weekend, during day, I had several groups of students approach me to practice their English. It took me a moment to realize that is what they were doing. As a tourist in nearby Old Quarter, someone approaching you is always an attempt to sell you something, part of being a tourist. But the students are very pleasant to speak with, energetic and enthusiastic to learn English by speaking with native English speakers. It was kind of fun to go over there today, knowing that it would happen.The first day here, I got up about 5AM (jet lagged), thinking that I would have the place to myself. Wrong! Ha Noi wakes up early. It seemed half the population of the city was here exercising in the morning. But I recommend it for that. You'll see everything from walking to running to weight lifting to old ladies doing aerobics to macarena music."

You cross the red wooden bridge into the temple and it's clearly a popular place with tourists and local alike. While many seem to be sincerely praying to the almighty, most others are happy clicking selfies, climbing the branches of mangrove trees, surrounding the temple. We saw a lot of students, crowd around an old gent, who was writing scrolls on papers for a small fee,I guess it's something like a 'wish' letter. Then there is the large stuffed turtle, by god..he is huge and guess spotting a live one in the lake, is considered lucky! One tip is to head to one of the restaurants like avalon, across the temple.

            "review": "Beautiful but busy. At first it seems a bit strange as there isn't much grass surrounding the lake (as I'm British its just different to English lakes). There are some very pretty flowers and large trees that branch over the lake pathways and some of the road providing some much needed shade for people walking around it.The flowers and garden patches surrounding the lake are very well tended to and there are many female gardeners always hard at work re-potting plants and weeding.There are ALWAYS people walking around the lake and doing their exercise routines, usually involving fast walking or some kind of independent yoga.During rush hour (5-7:30) it is best to avoid walking around the lake. Early morning or late evening is a better time to hang out and explore the lake, although it is quite small and takes roughly 20 minutes to walk around the whole thing.It is a very pretty lake, and there is so much lore and history about the lake of the restored sword. There is a one pillar pagoda, or small monument on a tiny island near the south of the lake called Turtle Tower to commemorate the legend of the restored sword (Ho Guom), but you cannot access this.The other building on the lake is a functioning red temple (Ngoc Son) with a bridge that you can actually go inside it and is worth a visit. As far as I recall they played traditional Vietnamese music daily that can be heard from anywhere near the lake.  If you ever go to one of the water puppet shows (roughly 100,000VND) they depict part of the story of the turtle who stole the sword from Emperor Le Thai To so that could give you more understanding of the history of the lake.NOTE: * beware of rats in the thick grassish areas, there are also cockroaches in and around the concrete edges of the lake. I think both of these pests are unavoidable in Hanoi in general, just a heads up.* vendors will definitely approach tourists so if you do not want anything you must be firm in saying no thank you -Khong Cam on (khawm gam eern)Hope this is helpful :)"

However we felt the tour guides rip you off as you can so easily do this visit yourself. Just buy a ticket at the little kiosk by the bridge and off you go. They give you brochures that explain everything about the Hoan Kien lake and this particular area."

If you ever find yourself lucky enough to visit Hanoi then make a plan to get to the lake around sunrise and plant yourself in one of the many park benches and absorb the serenity of the music and the ladies practicing Tai Chi."

There are many shops and places to eat on the perimeter of the lake. The lake it self and the walking area around it is not full of stalls and hawkers. So it's very relaxing. There is a building in he middle and the lake has a story, hence the name (read the guide books or book \"Hanoi Kids\")The is a temple in the lake that is accessed by a bridge. It's very nice. For photos, I recommend going in the evening when it's all acuminated and very beautiful. At night, I recommend not going alone. I felt safe, but a few shady persons were walking around."

You'll see the lovely Turtle Tower, positioned as though it were floating on the lake, as well as the similarly iconic The Huc Bridge. The legendary Metropole Hotel is paces away from the bottom end of the lake, while the Old Quarter and its shops are paces away from the northwest corner of the lake."

However, our guide assured us that it will just be a short walk and that in no time at all, we will be able to reach our next destination. I did not regret consenting to the walk. I find the short walk very peaceful. Although it was drizzling, it just made our walk more beautiful. We find street hawkers peddling their wares on the side of the lake and some local residents fishing for their food. It was very exciting to see the fish caught by them. Our guide told us that fishing in the lake is actually prohibited, but this did not deter the residents to do the same. The tranquility on this part of the lake was the exact opposite of the scenario at the other side of the lake facing business establishments where tourists flock to buy Kipling bags and purses, Northface jackets, etc. and to relax and dine in local restaurants. The water in the lake appeared to have some litters which proper authorities should address to preserve the cleanliness of the lake."

            "review": "The Legend of the Returned Sword. Ho Hoan Kiem means \"lake of the returned sword\". The story behind the name is a legend. In 1418, the Vietnamese emperor Le Loi fought a war against the Chinese. It wasn't going too well for him so when he walked by the lake one day, he saw a giant tortoise coming out of the water with a magic sword in its mouth. He took the sword and eventually defeated the Chinese army with it. When he was having his victory parade at the shores of Ho Hoan Kiem, the tortoise appeared again and demanded the sword back. Before he could do anything, the sword flew away from his hands to the tortoise's mouth. It disappeared in the water. The emperor had a temple built which can still be seen today. Now, here's the curious thing: In 1968, a giant tortoise was discovered dead in the lake. Scientists estimate that it's at least 200 years old. It is exhibited in the temple (Jade Hill Temple, located on a small island in Hoan Kiem Lake) and it is really huge: I would guess that it is about 1.5 metres long and weighs some 200 kilos.Apart from all these historic facts (that you can see in the shows in the Water Puppet Theatre next to the lake), Ho Hoan Kiem is a wonderful place to relax and watch the wind rippling the water. In the early morning and the evening, hundreds of Hanoians gather at the lakeshore to play badminton or do tai chi. Moreover, when you visit the lake at darkness, the lights of thousands vehicles passing by are beautifully reflected in the water"

If you do have the time take a stroll round the lake just to soak up the atmosphere.

The old Turtle Tower on a tiny island at one end was misty, looming out of the lake. Certainly without warm sunshine there were no turtles in view on the island. We visited the beautiful old temple at the end of the bridge, for which you pay a small entry fee, enjoying the serenity it gives despite the many visitors and worshippers. Some delightful trainee tour guides asked us if they could film us listening to their talk about the lake, and so we stood and listened to a sort of Vietnamese version of the Excalibur story... a sword given to a King of Vietnam, with which he vanquished enemies and saved the city. He returned to the lake to return the sword. A huge turtle emerged from the lake, and took the sword into the depths, but if ever Hanoi is under threat again, the sword will once again appear to be used in its defence. The lake is a gem in the centre of the hubbub of traffic in the old quarter, very pleasant to walk around. Lovely gardens surround it, between it and the road, and many people enjoy them. We saw a number of bridal couples having their photos taken with the beautiful lake and tower as backdrops to their traditional wedding clothes."

We were also able to take in the sights from high up in the Highland Coffee building at night and I think that it is even more beautiful at night. We visited just before Tet this year and with all the decorations we were truly fortunate."

This is one of places where it was \"oh, its along the way and will past by there anyway so let's go check it out\"...and thats how we ended up here. Initially, I wasn't too sure what to expect as when I goggled images of this place, it looked just nice as a lake and with a temple in the centre. That was about it. But what was the main attraction to me when I got there, wasn't the lake itself but what was happening in the sidelines. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and it was bustling with activity. There were your usual park goers just around for an afternoon stroll, to street artists drawing their scenes on paper or of a random stranger and being surrounded by curious crowds. There was also the celebration of events from school graduations and weddings which was made more exciting as they were all dressed in their colourful traditional fabrics. I certainly took more interest in what was happening around the lake than the lake itself and definitely a good place to venture to if you are into street photography. Place is quite accessible on foot if you are staying within the city, so just make sure you wear comfy walk shoes. Would recommended this place if you have time for a visit. Would be great as an after lunch walk...just make sure you have got your camera poised and ready!"

Plenty of tall shade trees will keep you cool and the locals are always there - en masse at 6am in particular, doing their Tai Chi and synchronised dancing and exercises to the beat of boom-boxes. There's a fin old fashioned colonial cafe which is an excellent place for a quirt coffee and cake and there are also a few small shrines scattered around the edge too. Don't miss the Golden Turtle shrine accessed via a small bridge to a miniature islet - there is an entry charge but it is loose change only. Not far from the entrance to this shrine is a classic piece of communist street sculpture with great, solid, blocky family figures, thrusting their arms skywards in a triumphal pose - a large video screen alongside plays communist party video propaganda - its a hoot. And just over the road is a strip of show shops - great brands, great value."

There should be two large tortoises living in the lake still. People believe that when you see a tortoise it will bring you good luck. Unfortunately, the only tortoise i saw that day was the one that was dead, painted over with lacquer to preserve and encased in glass. Oh well, you can't win 'em all.I was primarily impressed with the large fruit that were donated to the temple. They were as big as my face! it was crazy. There were people praying and burning fake USD around the temple. If you happen to be around, it's worth a visit. One of the more cultural things that you can do around Hanoi."

It is also a pleasant place to sit and relax from a grueling day of touring. In the months before Tet couples can be seen having their wedding photos taken. You may also be approached by students who want to practice their English. It is also near a Water Puppet theater. Colored lights illuminate the lake at night."

Go to the back and take the elevator to the 4th floor. Climb one flight of stairs and, voil\u00e1, you have the most wonderful view of the lake and the lovely red bridge.

My wife and I got into the habit of having a daily, evening stroll around the lake. The lake is truly is a focal point for public life in Hanoi and people watching is a highlight. I was particularly captivated by the vigorous arm swinging exercises of the older power walkers; the Tai Chi enthusiasts and the groups weight lifters sat around rickety, old equipment set up at the lakeside. We would often sit at one of the lakeside cafes and take in the sunset before the lake is lit up for the night. I also incorporated a few circuits of the lake into my morning run.

Jade Island's Temple of the Jade Mountain is worth a visit anytime if not to observe the rites then to observe the inclusions. The lake, tower and temple all relate to the belief of the sacred sword in the lake and the emperor Le Loi. The entry cost across the Huc Bridge to Jade Island is 20,000 dong, basically one dollar. It is easy to walk the complete circuit of the lake in an hour at a slow pace. The shores are used heavily for tai chi and social gatherings. There are numerous excellent views of the tower around the lake during the day and when illuminated at night, equally as beautiful. Really an enjoyable time waiting to be had."

Hoan Kiem Lake is not so far away from Hanoi's Old Quarter, so you can easily reach it by foot from there.The lake itself and the surrounding area with its parks are making for a nice change from the bustle of Hanoi all around (as much as this is possible with streets all around). I recommend a visit to the Ngoc Son temple - even though it's quite busy - the view toward the turtle tower is amazing. The temple features the preserved body of a large soft-shell turtle. It is said that some turtles are still living in the lake, I didn't see any during my visit, though."

There is a big mondo replica of the turtle there and the story is pretty cool. Good photos on the bridge. It was about a dollar or two to get in.

You will meet tourists from all over the world and also many very friendly Vietnamese. It is probable that if you sit down on one of the many park benches that a university student (or maybe 5 of them) will stop by to ask if they can practice their English with you. They will probably ask to take a picture with you also. If you are lucky you will see a fish or two jumping out of the water. They say there are very large turtles in the lake but I have never seen one. I have visited many times. The lake is right next to the \"Old Quarter\" another important tourist and locals destination. In the Old Quarter you can buy anything you may think of."

The lake could be a peaceful gem in the middle of the city but the good experience was ruined by persistent annoying hawkers and an attempted scam.In general you just can't seem to trust anyone who approaches you for anything which is really sad. I would not at all call this a peaceful place for a foreign tourists. Maybe it is good for the locals who are left alone but I was haggled nearly non-stop hawkers aggressively pushing their products. Even though you say no many times (one was putting a donut in my face and didn't seem to understand \"I'm fat, I don't need a donut\"). Another was selling pop up cards and pulling on my arm despite my repeated pleas I didn't want anything. The worst was yet to come. Luckily this time I was able to avoid being scammed yet again in Vietnam. This country is beautiful and I have enjoyed so many things but it needs serious help with the seemingly endless scams and tourist rip offs. The taxis are especially bad and fast meter scam is the worst I have seen anywhere in my travels. I was approached by a seemingly charming and beautiful young Vietnamese woman who spoke wonderful English. She said she was a student and asked me to help her English homework. I thought was a bit of an odd request to begin with. I said I only had a few minutes and after a little small talk and meaningless conversation I asked her to show me her assignment she wanted help on. She seemed to ignore what I said. She had a good size backpack but could not produce any assignments. Then she went on and started talking about other things asking me all sorts of questions about my travels and then again I asked her to show me her assignment. She then suggested that we go to a nearby cafe and get something to drink. Big backpack but no assignment? Very suspicious. I showed her my old shoes and told her I didn't have much money (which is the truth) and she quickly lost all interest and suddenly she had to meet a friend. Sure. Keep lying. This is an obvious scam. You go with them somewhere and you get an exorbitant bill. The same thing happened to me years ago when I \"trusted\" a group of students in Beijing. Most expensive tea I've ever drunk. If you go around the lake you are sure to see the same \"students\" everyday hanging out looking for tourists to scam. It's shameful these people would spend years learning English to only use it to scam tourists."

A live band accompanied the singers and a large crowd gave enthusiastic support to each act. No inhibitions; no jeering; a really unusual experience especially for an Australian who holds Karaoke in very low esteem. We also saw countless Bridal couples doing full blown Photo Shoots. The photos were apparently to be used for the invitation cards for guests. Not far away men will be playing Badminton, groups will be doing Yoga or exercising to music. It is a wonderful spot.

It's a pretty lake, eminently walkable (a circuit takes about 20 minutes) and eminently photographable, too. You'll see lots of brides-to-be hanging around being photographed for their wedding books, draped pleasingly against the lake background. There are plenty of concrete benches to rest on under shady trees. There's the famous bridge where, for a modest fee, you can cross and visit a little temple and museum containing the splendid turtle which came out of the lake, was then stuffed and now resides in a large vitrine. Sadly, the last giant turtle living in the lake was 'rescued' at the beginning of last year, subjected to a health-check, given some essential treatments and then returned to the newly-cleaned lake - and hasn't been seen since. Still, I live in hope as spotting it means good luck, good health and lots of money for the rest of the year.Beware the friendly 'students' who come up and engage you in conversation, however. Most of them will soon be trying to get a 'donation' out of you. Postcard sellers and shoeshine boys can be pretty insistent, too. Just say 'No thank you,' firmly (they all understand that) and walk on."

There are many many people doing various activities - tai chi, yoga, running, photography, or just contemplating.The shops and restaurants around the northern part of the lake open early so if you run and you find a need to hydrate, there's a number of small shops selling cold bottled water for 10K dong. There's also a breakfast place right on the shoreline in case you really get hungry.As the lake is small, there's not much to appreciate except for a small temple in the middle (almost) of the lake.

A walk around the lake will lead you to different places located around the lake as well. There is a pagoda and the red bridge at one end of the lake and another monument in the centre of the lake, which is nicely lighted up at night. I later found out that the monument used to be a grave but then later the story of the turtle claiming back the sword has also changed the significance of the grave. If you would like to find out more about the turtle story, you can visit the pagoda at the lake where they even house a replica of a giant turtle. The lake is definitely a place for photo shooting, be it at day or night time. The length of time that you want to spend here may differ, depending on what the purpose of your trip to the lake is."

This lake to the east of the city and on the border between the Old Quarter and the French Quarter is a fantastic place to have a drink, a bite to eat or even an ice cream or ice lolly whilst having a rest/break from sightseeing. To walk around the lake will take about 15 to 20 minutes and there are plenty of benches and walls to sit on at the lake edge. You'll be greeted with all sorts of things, from teenagers having an off the cuff sing along to a class of women enjoying some form of exercise with music playing in the background.I was writing postcards on a bench on the edge of the lake and was approached on more than one occasion by local students just wanting to talk to you to practice their English - very polite and very friendly. So if you look as though you may speak English (like I was told I do by one student) be prepared to take a little time to speak to the friendly locals.You'll also be greeted by other locals trying to sell you an array of things, cards, postcards, tourism books, novels etc. If you need/want any of these things be prepared to haggle (I got a book I was planning to buy back home for \u00a32.80 GBP), if you say that the price is too high or that you cannot afford it eventually you will be asked to offer what you want/you can afford and invariably they will accept your offer. If you don't need any of these things just politely say no thank you, smile and carry on walking, because if you stop you will find yourself being drawn into buying something you don't want and potentially wasting some of your touring time.There is a post office at the bottom right (south east) of the lake for anyone who needs to send anything home or for anyone who wants to send a postcard home. After purchasing stamps go outside and post your items in the yellow post box outside."

It is nice to walk around the lake and experience lots of thing around Hoan Kiem Lake. You must try to get up early, about 5.30 or 6.00 to see local people doing exercises, tai Chi, Aerobic. It is nice to sit at City View Cafe, on 5th floor, you will enjoy looking at Hoan Kiem Lake, streets, motorbikes. In Autumn, Hoan Kiem Lake is really beautiful as some flower is blooming. It is worth to vitsit Hoan Kiem Lake."

The story of the restored sword it worthwhile understanding as it appears in many parts of the Vietnamese culture so before you go read up. If you see the man playing the flute give him some money he is very good. Just remember in Vietnam there is no social welfare system so if you have a disability your own your own. Making a small donation to one or other (or several) of the locals with disabilities is very worthwhile and the few dollars it cost you is nothing in compassion with what they can do with your few dollars.

Some photographers, couples on their pre-nuptial photo shoots and students pop up in the late afternoon as well. In any case, I was pleasantly surprised at how well-kept the place is. Seeing all the warnings in forums, I was a bit apprehensive and kept my bag close. Once I was there though, I felt like those who were there were also busy taking in the view and enjoying the breeze. It was a good area for the community to gather -local, foreigner, young or old are drawn here for their own reasons.

According to the legend, Emperor L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was boating on the lake when a Golden Turtle God (Kim Qui) surfaced and asked for his magic sword, Heaven's Will. L\u1ee3i concluded that Kim Qui had come to reclaim the sword that it\u2019s master, the Dragon King (Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng) had given L\u1ee3i some time earlier, during his revolt against the Chinese Ming Dynasty. L\u1ee3i renamed the lake to commemorate this event. He renamed the lake from Luc Thuy (Green Water\") to Hoan Kiem Lake (Lake of the Restored Sword) . The Turtle Tower (Thap R\u00f9a) standing on a small island near the centre of lake is linked to the legend.Near the northern shore of the lake lies Jade Island on which the Temple of the Jade Mountain (Ngoc Son Temple) stands. The temple was erected in the 18th century in honour of the 13th-century military leader Tran Hung Dao who fought heroically against the Yuan Dynasty. Jade Island is connected to the shore by the wooden red-painted The Huc Bridge.

There are people jogging, lifting weights, chatting, and often just relaxing and watching the world go by.It truly does feel like a place the Vietnamese appreciate and respect.

We had a really nice time relaxing, people watching and enjoying the scenery of the lake.We liked it so much that we returned a few days later after our trip to Halong Bay. After walking the entire circumference of the lake and exploring its surroundings, we realized that this was a place that attracted a large section of the local population, as well as the tourists. There were a lot of joggers, old folks doing tai chi or whatever exercise they wanted, hip hop dancers, weightlifters spread out all around the lake.While the daytime view was quiet, reflective and calming, I preferred the night time view where you get the see the lights in the trees create a surreal environment. It was quite romantic to walk along the lake with the lights. In addition, there are quite a few nice restaurants dotted around the lake, especially the west end of the lake.There are quite a few attractions near the lake so its a good place to start if you want to do some sightseeing. Otherwise, you can get a glimpse of the like of ordinary Vietnamese just by observing the activities going on around the lake."

At different times of the day, you get to see the Vietnamese people enjoy the lake differently - workout and sports in the morning, afternoon, and sometimes at night; children climbing a rock to an altar in the day and couples enjoying the scenery in the evening. And street hawkers trying their best to sell you sugar cane (though very diluted), food and ice cream. Worth to see the scenery both in the morning (to take lovely sunrise pictures) and at night (where the attractions are all lighted up in various colours). If you live close by, it's even better.

The lake is truly beautiful during the day with Ngoc Son Temple and Turtle Tower standing within its waters. There are extensive walkways and garden type areas around the lake also which come to life in the evening with some beautifully colourful lighting. The Huc Bridge is a bright scarlet red whilst the trees all around depict a variety of colours all intermingled to create a real spectacle. We walked around the lake for a section of its perimeter and it was clear it attracts both local and tourist couples to sit and relax for a while, keen to get away from the hustle and bustle that surrounds them and even though there are many people in the evening there always seems to be an area where a piece of tranquillity can be found. I thought this place was just great. A fairly large area of water which acts as a focal point for the city and from around which most of Hanoi's attractions are within walking distance.

You need to agree the price is for one or two people, how long the ride will be (point at a watch or write down the time for agreement).

The lake is full of tortoise and because they are a sacred animal (along with dragon, phoenix and unicorn) in Vietnamese culture it is considered good luck if you see one. The lake is a short walk from Hanoi's Old Quater where most of the hotels are, city maps are easy to come by so you can find your way here and back. A must see local landmark.

The Lake plays a central role in Vietnamese history, the story being a turtle that gave a sword to the emperor, which he used to repel one of the many Chinese invasions. To this day there are still giant turtles living in the lake, although it's hard to imagine that anything could live in the green murky water. They are not natural, having been transplanted centuries ago, but the current inhabitants are thought to be over 100 years old each.Take a walk around the entire lake in the morning or evening and you will join the thousands of locals out for their daily exercise.

Everyone - locals and tourists alike come here to congregate, people watch, take a nap, have a date, take pictures or just sit on the bench under the trees like some of the old Vietnamese people do. It's a large lake but you can walk around this lake in a hour - 2 hours if you dawdle and take pictures. There's the turtle tower which is the main attraction on one end and a temple on the other end. There's shops and restaurants around the lake and just a little off one end - is a large shopping center with all the designer stores. A block away are the local markets where you can shop for souvenirs, tshirts, bags, silk, handicrafts and also local food stands."

The lake was festooned with lights, and there were many people out and promenading. It was a great place to stroll and people watch. We also jogged around it in the early morning and we saw a lot of people practicing tai chi. All in all it's a major attraction in the center of town and close to the old quarter"

Hoan Kiem Lake would seem to be the place the locals of Hanoi like to promenade, so for tourists it is ideal to sit and watch, or stroll around the perimeter. Crossing the road to get there in the first place is something between madness and faith, but step out and keep moving. If you stop you'll confuse the driver and he won't know which side to dodge around you. The lakeside pavement can be uneven in places, so watch your step. There are seats along the way to stop and people-watch. Young folk with fluffy little dogs, older folk doing their exercises, artists to paint your portrait, hawkers of wares - you'll see them all. There are various cafes around the lake for drinks or a meal. Visiting Haon Kiem Lake is a must-do when in Hanoi."

Located just on the edge of the Old Quarter, it is a serene oasis surrounded by broad sidewalks (rare in Hanoi) flanked by benches, enormous arching shade trees, and lovely landscaped flower beds. Early in the morning and again In the evening, you see many people doing Tai Chi, jogging, and walking, as well as simply strolling along or sitting quietly on benches. Great photo ops, both of the lake and buildings as well as all the people! At one end of the lake, you find a picturesque temple reached by the charming red bridge and the lotus tower. In the middle of the lake is the 'turtle tower' (we saw people in boats going out there but didn't go ourselves.). Stop for a drink or a meal at one of the lakeside restaurants or snack stands, or cross the street and do some shopping- it's lovely in the evening when the lights are shining on the Turtle tower. One can walk around the whole lake in about 30 minutes, and it's easy to see why it is such a popular landmark in the city."

The path around the lake is fully paved so it is wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of trees and bench seats to enjoy.You will soon notice a wooden red bridge linking the lake shore to the small temple on an island. The red bridge is called The Huc while the temple on the island is Ngoc Son pagoda. Both are historic landmarks for many centuries already. The original Ngoc Son pagoda was built in the 11th century. Today, a vietnamese general who defeated the Mongols in the 13th century is venerated inside.Lake access is free. However, access to the Ngoc Son pagoda is paidThe best time to visit is probably just before the Lunar New Year where the streets around the lake, the bridge The Huc are all illuminated. On Lunar New Year eve at midnight, there is a 15 minute fireworks display. If you stay in the Somerset Grand hotel which is only 300 meters away, several rooms have direct lake views to enjoy the spectacular fireworks."

In many cities it\u2019s a long wait until the 2pm check-in but here in one of SE Asia\u2019s more quaint capital cities I made my way to Hoan Kiem Lake where I knew there were park benches & a nice view. I found instead a peaceful place to watch the city come to life. On the banks of Hoan Kiem Lake I saw old women sitting on the benches with their carrying poles; baskets full of fruit resting their crooked backs before the day\u2019s work, old veterans in their uniforms sipping filtered Vietnamese coffee sweetened with condensed milk & groups of local people practicing Tai Chi, the old people\u2019s kung-fu. One of the simple things that make the lake special is a little temple pagoda standing all alone out in the middle of the lake, known as the Turtle Tower. It has a distinct Chinese design & currently has a worn weathered-look. I think the lakeside is one of the more romantic places in Hanoi, I saw Vietnamese couples sitting together holding hands talking to each other, it was nice to see this in the modern age. After sunset, the temple is beautifully lit up, silent in its quiet isolation out in the waters. When I was young, my parents told me a story about how one of the early emperors fought off the evil Chinese with a magical sword called \u2018Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean\u2019 translated as Heaven\u2019s Will. We were all told that driving out the Chinese was the will of the gods! Eventually after this victory, a huge turtle, a giant fresh water species native to the lake appeared & asked for the return of the sword to Heaven, that\u2019s how the lake got its name, Lake of the Returned Sword, like king Arthur\u2019s story about Excalibur. With the turtles nowadays almost extinct, some people fear the return of the Chinese with all their war-mongering over the disputed Spratley Islands, perhaps this time Heaven will send down a few nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, F-22 Raptors & some Apache helicopter gunships for good measure."

Watch the Hanoians going about their daily rituals. Observe the happenings on the fringes. Be enchanted by the evening lanterns and lights. Just take the time. Hoan Kiem lake isn't so much about the lake itself, it's about the life around the lake. There is no better way, in my opinion, to feel the heartbeat of Hanoi than to take an evening stroll around the lake.

The spot is a very popular destination for locals and tourists alike and its one that I have walked around many times just for some light hearted exercise and relaxation amongst the chaotic pace of Ha Noi life. Take some time out of your morning (if you\u2019re an early riser) to have a refreshing stroll around the lake and admire the many yoga enthusiasts as you casually plod along around them on your way. If you can spare the extra time, the walk later in the evening is also very pleasant. The lighting displays around the lake and the shimmering reflections from the surrounding buildings make for some very pretty sights and photos and for the food tourist, during the evening there is usually a selection of small street vendors char-grilling or selling some very tasty local and ethnic Vietnamese treats at the water\u2019s edge.

Honestly originally I came down to the river from my hotel for nothing else but exercise as our hotel did not have gym. The lake itself takes about 20 minutes to walk around at a relatively brisk pace. Although it is not overtly attractive what is amazing is to see all the locals out exercising. Do yourself a favour, if you do get there early (6.30 - 7.30am) take a walk around the whole lake before you do anything else. There is an eclectic mix of exercising going on, you will see people walking, running, you will pass the 'muscle building' group, thai chi group/s, ballroom dancing groups (what was cute was I saw an old man teaching another old man to dance...so sweet), you will see aerobics (to gangnam style amongst other things), some thing where there is two lines of people banging/massaging each others backs and necks, badminton, some kind of footbal with a small ball like thing and so much more. It is just amazing to see. Life is not easy here in Vietnam, it is hard for most people to make a dollar, they work long hours and after all of that they get up early to do some form of exercise - makes my excuses for why I can't pretty pitiful! I walked down by the lake every morning here, it was so entertaining. I highly recommend...you might even try joining in with a group!"

The sunrise time - you see all the elders gathered going through their yoga and tai chi, and others making the morning jog. Pleasant air and a really nice feeling to be around all the energy.The afternoon is a lot more laid back with fewer people so you can easily find an open bench near the water and sit and relax for a bit and enjoy the scenery. The night and evening I totally loved. The funnest part was seeing all the to-be-wed couples out taking their wedding pictures.Would definitely recommend this to everyone to at least see at one time or another during your stay in Hanoi.

The best time to visit is in the early morning where the filtered sunlight shines through the leaves unto the waters. Another time is during the evenings and the night scene where the temple and the bridge are all lighted up. Benches lined the full lengths of the lake and its very inviting to sit by after long walks, sip a coffee , take a snack or a nap or simply people watching. We can sit down for 1-2 hours and watch students and elderly folks going about their activities. There are ice cream kiosks and cafes dotting the lake side.

Anyway, when you go further inside (from the entrance after paying the entrance fee), there is a bridge connecting to the Ngoc Son Temple. Inside you can see a very big turtle on display (embalmed). I used to think that the legend of the big turtle is really for real. :) This place is not that big and you can visit this place for less than an hour. A good view to relax your mind."

On our first evening in Hanoi we took a leisurely stroll around the lake, partially because that meant we didn't have to endanger our lives crossing roads infested with motor bikes. It was a great walk, people watching and just taking in the calm view of the lake, but mostly trying to spot the turtle! No luck.The next day we spent a nice time by the lake with the Hanoi Kids. Great discussions were had, and much was learned of the lake and Vietnamese history, all the while keeping an eye out for the turtle. No luck.Last morning in Hanoi. I decide to go to the lake to watch the morning Tai Chi. Really great, all the while keeping one eye open for the ancient and venerable turtle. No luck.Feeling hungry, as it was now breakfast time, I sat myself at an outside table in a caf\u00e9 right beside the lake and ordered one of those great Vietnamese iced coffees.I took my first sip, all the time gazing at the water, hoping for a glimpse of the venerable, old one.Oh, my God! There he was, raising his wrinkly old head, momentarily, casually, above the surface, for a gulp of air and then disappearing in one big ripple.I cried out. No-one seemed to care. I did. I saw the turtle!"

Being a tall Englishman I get a lot of attention from the young Vietnamese ladies too, which is nice. You can ask one of these students the history of the lake and they will happily tell you.

As you go, stare at an absolutely intriguing array of character-dripping faces and then imagine the stories that each one of these could tell if you were able to stop them and talk. By all means try and strike up at least one conversation. If you succeed I am certain you will be richly rewarded. The only problem, at least in the early morning, is the determination of most people to complete their early morning fitness ritual- another legacy of the great man Uncle Ho!

And in between, you can enjoy the views of the Hanoi skyline from various angles as you join the locals and tourists in relaxation. Lately, it's common for young Vietnamese to come here to practice English with visitors. (In fact, during my last visit, I was stopped so often it became almost tiresome.) There is a nice caf\u00e9 at the NW corner of the lake that looks directly out over the water. The streets of the surrounding Old Quarter can be quite confusing, so the lake makes a great point of reference. I recommend making several visits at different times of the day, and always with a camera. Plan 30-45 minutes to go all around the lake depending on how often you stop and how fast you walk. There are fairly clean toilets on the east side of the lake for a small fee."

Just one unhappy incident marred our memories of this quarter: At our next visit we will avoid at all costs the Phung Thien Club's so-called \"Art Gallery\" which charges exorbitant prices for artisanat items, at 79 Hang Trong Street. It's the last building, a lovely white structure, where Hang Thong Street meets Le Thai To, which runs along one side of the lake. $4 is charged for a lacquered coconut husk bowl which one finds sold at many lacquer merchandise shops for $2.50. An easy mistake is not to wait and look round more instead of assuming that an art gallery wouldn't overcharge by over 50%. When confronted with the discrepancy, the owner's blase attitude was that customers should check before buying - they purchase items there at their own risk. So be warned!"

Off in any direction are so many shops and lovely people I ended up going back at least half a dozen times. With wonderful food and the time to sit and laugh with the locals it is a great memory for me. Night markets just up the street on the weekends are a buzz of people and sites that bring a smile to your face. Hope this helps you enjoy your trip and take the time to sit and talk. Even if you don't understand their language these where some of the funniest times and best laughs with respect I had.Cheers to you all and hope you enjoy Vietnam and it's People,Bill"

This lake that is situated between the Old Quarter and the French Quarter of Hanoi is the heart of recreational and social activities in Hanoi. In the early monrings and evenings till late, this lake is teeming with people. Particularly so during the weekends and public holidays.The name of the lake comes from a legend in which the King's magic sword was grabbed by a turtle and disappeared into the lake. The story has it that the sword was reclaimed by the Golden Turtle God. The sword was given to the king in order that he revolted against the Chinese Ming Dynasty. The lake thus got its name and a small shrine on the island in the lake is to commemorate the event. It is called the turtle tower.There is an indeterminate number of soft-shelled turtles still living in the water of the lake. These turtles are deemed endangered.The temple of Jade Mountain sits on an island at the northern part of the lake. It honours a hero, Tran Hung Dao, Van Xuong and Nguyen Van Sieu (scholar, Confucian master and writer respectively) who fought against the Yuan Dynasty. This island is joined to the shore by the Morning Sunlight Bridge.With the setting sun in the evening, it is a very nice walk around the entire circumference of the lake of approximately 2-2.5 km. Along the walk you'd find people, young and old doing their exercises. There is even an outdoor gym area, presumably with equipment put there by the gym enthusiasts themselves. They seem self-organized. These Vietnamese seem to be very much into fitness and healthy lifestyles. Parents with their young children playing, lovers whispering sweet nothings and in embrace. Older folks doing tai-chi. All these are part of the tapestry of life in Hoan Kiem Lake.End the walk at the northern end or the southern end and you'd find cafes and restaurants on the opposite side of the streets that go round the lake. At the northern end is the Old Quarter, where there numerous grid-patterned streets host large numbers of eateries and shops selling all kinds of goods, from trinkets and souvenirs, to hardware and electronics."

There are a number of vendors trying to sell you various items and this can be a little off putting, but if you are polite they usually leave you to it. The walk over the bridge and around the island was nice with plenty to see, another place to escape the traffic madness. It is not expensive with the entrance fee set at 20,000 dong. Allow a good two hours to relax and enjoy especially if the weather is hot."

The rest of Hanoi was out: parents with young children; old folk taking the breeze on a comfortable bench; lovers sorting out life's vicissitudes; groups of young lads being noisy; gaggles of pre-teen girls being noisier; people taking photos of each other and us taking photos of everyone else taking photos. Such fun! People were friendly, we all smiled at each other. Nothing was for sale; nobody wanted us to buy anything. We came across people we would not be likely to ever meet and we shared moments in passing. As legend has it the lake has some tortoise stories attached to it, and a magic sword. There are two islands in the lake, one has a Tortoise Tower and the other has a Temple.The Tortoise it is said took back the magic sword from the King Le Thai To in the 15th Century after he defeated the Chinese. The Temple on the other island is 20th Century vintage and represents: military spirit; medicine; and, literature. Needless to say we got some fantastic photos of ordinary citizens of Hanoi enjoying their Sunday."

The one in the middle is tiny and you may recognise its delightful (inaccessible)Tortoise Pagoda as an iconic landmark of Hanoi. The other, nearer the Old Quarter, houses Ngoc Son temple, immediately recognisable by its red wooden bridge, framed by weeping willow trees (or similar). You will not have to pay to approach or cross the bridge for some excellent photo opportunities, but there is an entry fee to visit the temple itself. It is a pleasant stroll around the lake (try going anti clockwise beginning on Le Thai To Street)and keep your eyes open for the very old well maintained (and likely deserted) temple across the street, about half way along. The only rest room I remember is on this stretch of the walk however there are several cafes and food stalls - not so on the other side. The far end of the lake is a business district and as you round the end, and head back along Dinh Tien Hoang Street towards the Old Quarter, you will find the Post Office, and also some elegant colonial buildings and a square with a large statue and gardens. Locals frequent the shady lakeside area and I observed several courting couples sweetly holding hands and kissing. I'll bet that sort of thing wasn't allowed in the not too distant past.Ignore the overpriced tourist tat near Ngoc Son - you'll find it elsewhere. Just past Ngoc Son , back near the Old Quarter there is a large bus terminus however there is no shelter if it is raining, but there are some shady trees. If you are adventurous, jump on any bus here and see where it takes you, taking care to check where you will need to stand to catch a returning bus. The Water Puppet Theatre is just nearby and you will also spot a KFC, if you are hungering for western style fast food."

It is home to a large \"stuffed\" turtle which apparently lived in the lake at some point in time. Given the condition of the water, (filthy) I am not surprised it died."

Said to be the residence of an ancient turtle that once magically saved the city from invasion, the lake is at once a place of pilgrimage for the believers and voyeuristic joy for tourists from worlds away. I lived in Hanoi for several months and quickly came to adore this place. I was lucky enough to visit it countless times in all different circumstances. Pro tip: If you hang around, you could be lucky enough to bare witness to a rare sighting of the turtle and some of its offspring at the water's edge!To Do:1) Visit the museum that seems to float on water to find out all about the legends of the lake. 2) Take an early morning jog around the edge. This is the prime time to see all the locals selling their wares before the day becomes too hot, and also to enjoy the placidness of the lake before hordes of tourists descend. 3) Re-visit on a warm midnight. It's fascinating and humbling to sit quietly by the water's edge right in the centre of the city, with silence engulfing you, knowing that the chaos begins all over again in only a few hours.4) Walk the entire perimeter. Every turn has something new to offer, both on the lake and the buildings around it - a monument of some kind; a special flower garden; a crazy vietnamese wedding; as well as everything from banks, to restaurants, to shoe stalls to a skate park. It's all there.This is one destination in Hanoi you can't very well avoid. Soak in all it has to offer. Highly recommend it!"

It wasn\u2019t going too well for him so when he walked by the lake one day, he saw a giant tutrtle coming out of the water with a magic sword in its mouth. He took the sword and eventually defeated the Chinese army with it. When he was having his victory parade at the shores of Hoan Kiem, the turtle appeared again and demanded the sword back. Before he could do anything, the sword flew away from his hands to the tortoise\u2019s mouth. It disappeared in the water. The emperor had a temple built which can still be seen today."

I wouldn't.The legend of the emperor losing his sword to a giant turtle which came up out of the lake and snatched it is more interesting to reflect upon than the cocaphany of car horns and crowds of people everywhere on the pathways. We didn't see a turtle this time, but my husband saw one last year when he was in town. They are few and far between, which doesn't surprise me given the water quality. If you're a people watcher I think Hoan Kiem Lake makes a fine afternoon outing. Just don't come expecting peace or quiet."

The lake has a good story about its name and is where the famous golden turtles live. There are only few of the gold turtles that are still alive in the lake.Of course, most people come to the lake not to find the rare turtle, but for a nice drink while seating somewhere next to the lake, watching people passing by. Being a genuine Hanoian, I find it amazing how I can spend hours just sitting in a cafe next to Hoan Kiem Lake, watching people passing by. Some people might find it such a waste of time, but I find it one of the best way to spend time in Hanoi. A kid coming back home from school, a salaryman rushing to work, a housewife shopping for dinner, an elderly jogging together around the lake, and many other types of people. Just a glance and I can image who they are, what they do, where they are heading to.For a tourist, having a coffee and watch the beautiful lake and the willow swaying in the wind is not so bad for an afternoon."

A student did that with me and we sat there for two hours and she finally had to reluctantly depart for school. Den Ngoc Son is a small temple on an island towards the north end. There's a small fee to go on the island but well worth it. On the south end of the temple is a small plaza and there were elderly men playing the game 'Go' with others watching and kibitzing. South is the Tortoise Tower rising gracefully against the trees. At the northwest perimeter of the lake is a cafe - Thuy Ta - which is a great place to sit for a bite to eat and look out over the lake.

This lake is a peaceful symbol of Hanoi. I love walking around the lake with my friends. I always want to show everybody the beauty of this lake and hope many people come there to visit. Please understand that I don't want to make a bad image of it. but, Today I walked around the lake and I saw some terrible things that I really want to warn all tourists who will visit there. I don't know how to share my warning to foreigner tourists so I post there. When we were walking, my friend went to the public toilet at the lake ( in my following picture). While we were waiting for her, we saw some thieves were trying to steal foreigner tourist's assets. One man pretended to sell souvenirs, aimed to distract the tourists and the other man tried to open the tourist's bag and stole things. Their area is at this public wc and foreigners are their objects. I witness a tourist wore a bag at his back and didn't know that the thief was opening his bag. I was really shocked when I saw that terrible thing was happening in front of my eyes. We thought that they are in a crowded thief group so many people near that WC saw that but didn't say anything, maybe they are accomplices. Others didn't dare to help because they're afraid of that those thief would hit them. So we tried to warn as many tourists as we could on the way around the lake. I was very sad because of that, it's the 1st time I saw those things happen at Hoan Kiem lake, and don't know how to help other tourists who visit my hometown. We thought about talking with securities but maybe it will not help much, the securities maybe know but don't do anything. So people who will visit there, please put your bag in front of you and take care of it. Be careful when you visit there. Enjoy your trip:). Hope that you love Hanoi :). Thank you so much!"

We've been here during Tet (New Year) and on NY day, it was lovely to walk around the lake with its gorgeous floral displays and see all the locals in their finery having photos taken amongst the flowers. The lake is just bog enough to feel like you had some decent excercise to work off a bit of the yummy food to be had around here."

It has a mystical look to it in the mistiness of the morning, is beautiful in the clearness of full sunshine, and there are always plenty of people to see if you are into \"people watching\". The highlight of this visit though was when we were wandering around after a late afternoon performance at the Puppet theatre and we were heading for ice-cream at Fanny's when we spotted a crowd of people gathered in one spot by the edge of the lake. Being inquisitive we wandered over to see what was happening. They appeared to be gazing at the lake - not the clearest of water to be gazing at I might add - when suddenly up popped a turtles head!!!!! Now I would like to think it is THE turtle spoken of - the REALLY old turtle that lives in the lake. And I will believe that even though people back home say there are probably more than one turtle living in there and this one was nothing special but....... Needless to say, the lake is a central point of any visit to Hanoi."

Bridges, the most decorative of which is the red-wood/iron flag-festooned Huc Bridge, lead to islands that break up the expanse of water. A promenade that runs around the lake serves the same function as New York's Central Park for the city\u2019s joggers, and skillfully concealed benches meet the needs of its lovers. The parallel with Central Park is emphasized by the long views across the lake leading to distant vistas of imposing buildings. But when you really analyze it, the park itself is not all that exceptional. The wonder is that in a city so ugly and polluted, it is there at all. It is, literally, a breath of fresh air amid the suffocating squalor of the Old Quarters from which access to it is gained. We were there on a rainy week-day in December. It might be very much better on a festive summer evening, although I will not have a chance to find out."

Sure, it's quieter and more tranquil than the old quarter but barely so. The relentless horns tooting and lead-infused air still permeate this area. Not worth a visit in its own right unless u view it in context of Hanoi which is boring in general."

You will be surprised that literally hundreds, maybe thousands, of exercisers are already there. There are badminton partners, tai chi classes (with fans, sticks, swords), aerobics groups, a ballroom dance class and many others doing all kinds of exercises. Mostly old or older people but there are also young joggers, people on crutches, in wheelchairs, etc.No where in my travels have I ever experienced this kind of enthusiasm for exercise.

After stealing a kiss and heading back to your hotel its worth getting up really early to get back to the lake and watch or join in the old Hanoians in their exercise... it's truly entertaining and healthy at the same time. They employ a strange mix of limb swinging, bum wiggling and body dipping each morning to stay healthy, and by the looks of them it works. After that it's worth grabbing some breakfast taking in some sights of the old quarter and returning the third and final time to walk around at midday, get a famous and expensive ice cream from the West shore of the lake (across the road) and check out the temple that has a big embalmed turtle in it. Finish off by grabbing a beer with a view of the crazy road junction on the north shore of the lake and marvel at the locals systemless driving that somehow works."

In the morning the lake area is crowded with folks out for their morning exercise -- running or walking in a clockwise circle around the lake or joining in with the many tai chi, martial arts, calisthenics, aerobics, and even ballroom dancing groups that meet in the open areas at water's edge. It is a useful locator for navigating the city; for addresses downtown, people generally give directions in relation to it. It's good to know how to get from the lake to your hotel. The lake is also the jumping-off point for exploring the Old Quarter, Hanoi's labyrinth of traditional craft streets in a sprawling maze on the north end of the lake. Lakeside is also a good place to find a bench and rest your toes after trundling around town, and you can find some good little cafes, particularly on the north end.

L\u1ee3i renamed the lake to commemorate this event, it was formerly known as Luc Thuy meaning \"Green Water\"). The Turtle Tower (Thap R\u00f9a) standing on a small island near the centre of lake is linked to the legend."

The small traders/stallholders were on their way with their goods to set up shop. Workers were starting to set off on their scooters and bikes. The lake surrounds, when I arrived, was alive with the locals. Most were exercising, some were seriously exercising while others were pretending to exercise while gossiping with friends, some were fishing, some were just sitting watching the world go by. There was tai chi, badminton, jogging, walking backwards, chin ups, push ups, knees ups. There were groups doing exercises to music, another group was into chest slapping in unison while another was into shouting 'ha, ha, ha, rest, ha, ha, ha'. Men tended to be more solitary and as they became hotter shirts were removed or rolled up to their armpits. It made me happy to be amongst a community that knows how to use their public space and don't care about impressing others just about having a good time with their friends."

The commitment of older people to their fitness and Qi Gong is marvellous. Unselfconscious seniors walk with purpose with particular arm swings, they stretch using a tree or a bench to anchor themselves and others carry out a routine alone or in a small group. One day a group had a few 'gym aids' and on another I joined a stationary conga line of women who were being coached by a man, to carry out shoulder and back massage. It was great.If you are willing to engage, there are so many opportunities. Lovers or other tourists appreciate you taking their photo; young people want to practise their English; dogs play sociably together, people parade, there are parents, fathers and grandparents with little ones, people pushed in wheelchairs, and old people always respond to a respectful nod of acknowledgement and a smile. For some reason we were taken as French more than once so we were able to use our very basic French to connect. Monsieur Le (retired) Professeur de Mathematique (who had spent a lot of time in Toulouse) was so pleased to chat that he took photos with us. There he was again the next day, with his bicycle, but this time he took a moment from coaching a student in French, to accept deux basiers and to pose for photos we took.The Lake is a really interesting oasis in the middle of the busy noisy pollution that is Hanoi.The kiosk is a good place to sit and people watch and the prices are fair.It is only when you are back at home that you are struck by the absence of alcohol and aggression and the consideration and polite behaviour, in such a crowded space used by so many"

Hawkers sell balloons, toys and food of all types around the waterfront."

Having very nearly not survived the traffic crossing the road to reach the lake, I feel very privileged to be able say that I have walked the circumference of Hoan Kiem lake and made it home again afterwards. It is certainly nothing special by the standards of city center parks and lakes in some European cities, but compared to the city centers of most Asian cities, the lake is very much an oasis in the middle of the city. There are many places to sit, lots of greenery, a number of small restaurants and cafes and the lake is small enough to be able to walk comfortably without being so small that you end walking around multiple times in a few minutes. The lake itself is very calm and serene but no where on the lake is far from the city center traffic so it is never really peaceful either.It is well and truly worth a walk either early or late in the day and remember to be careful navigating the traffic to cross the street"

At the center of activity, if not the geography, of Old Town Hanoi is Hoan Kiem, a lake rich with tradition and surrounded by people morning noon and night. The lake reputedly is the home of a large, 500-year-old turtle, which is still sighted from time to time, and which survives the other ancient turtle that died in the bombings in 1968 and is preserved in a glass case in the temple on the lake today. The name means \u201cLake of the Returned Sword, as legend has it that a turtle in the lake gave a sword to the king to help him repel the Chinese invaders 600 years ago. A red bridge with brightly colored banners links the shore to a temple in the lake, outside of which old men play Chinese chess and slap pieces down loudly onto the ground with each decisive move, and inside of which people come to burn incense and make prayers to the icons of one of three kings. On the bridge, engaged couples and bridal parties are getting photographed amid the continuing flow of locals and tourists. This is really a wonderful place to experience the energy of Old Town Hanoi, whether in the morning for group Tai Chi, or mid-day for brides and chess, or evenings for colorful lights, families, more group exercise, and family and romantic outings. Cannot imagine a trip to Hanoi without some time at the lake."

The lake continues its importance today as a symbol of the independence of Vietnam and its people, but also as a centre of recreation. If you turn up at five in the morning or in the late afternoon you will see many Hanoians taking exercise in classes or just walking around the lake. The ice cream place on the lake is good and you can sit on the terrace overlooking the lake whilst you eat it. The main island on the lake houses a pagoda (and a stuffed giant turtle) and the bridge to it is again famous. Difficult to miss, but also a must on a visit to Hanoi."

It is highly unfortunate that such a significant cultural landmark as this body of water and temple is not better kept up. The lake is completely green with algae and there seemed little interest in residents or tourists in keeping the area clean. I agree with other reviewers that it's in a great area with cafes, restaurants and shopping. While I rated this average due to it's current condition, there is opportunity to improve with more focus on preserving the living conditions for the rare symbolic turtle(s) that live here."

The lake has a temple in the middle which is reachable across a short bridge along the north eastern side of the lake. The temple houses a turtle from the species which purportedly aided the King by lending him a sword which was dutifully returned to the turtle by the victorious king. The lake looks very pleasant by day with a soft mist covering it every morning around Tet and by night it looks magnificent in grandiose lighting. There are several coffee shops where one can dine alfresco. We opted for one of the coffee places on the 4th level of a building overlooking the square and the lake. However, I'd strongly like to point out that on northern end of the lake opposite the road there is a group of 4 odd women who keep strolling the pedestrian walk way and have the gall to open my wife's haversack whilst she's walking. Thankfully my wife sensed some foul play and immediately turned to see a woman opening her bag and made a ruckus, immediately the lady turned and started observing a menu card on display a few steps away and another lady immediately came and explained to my wife that nothing was wrong. We did complain to a few policemen who were a hundred meters away but they said that if nothing is stolen then not to pursue the matter forward. Just wanted to caution all travelers so that their vacation is not ruined by a few lousy thieves. I'd like to state here that every other experience that we had with the local Vietnamese people was fabulous and we have absolutely no other complaints."

I was out to photograph those who were wearing colourful clothes (it was around 20 degrees Celsius though).

The red bridge is a great photo opportunity and the temple itself at 20000d is a nice place to see the various ceremonies. The path around the eastern side of the lake is dotted by ladies selling delicious sausages on a stick and old guys selling popcorn and candy floss. I've read that it's also a great place to go jogging as you can make a full circuit of the lake quite easily in none busy periods.

Prices in the French quarter is rather reasonable to me, you may find cheaper food in old quarter but the hawkers tend to rip you off , eg by charging you 50,000dong for a pho, which you can have for 45,000dongs at pho24 in the French quarter, in a much nicer environment, cleaner, plus a plate of herbs which is clean, unlike the hawkers who usually recycle the uneaten herbs left over by the previous customers.One minus points about the Lake- it is rather dirty."

Loely atmosphere all around the lake in he evening, gets dark around 6PM, with an SLR on a tripod you can do magic herre. Many trees are lit up like Christmas, the wooden bridge lit up in Neon, lots of people exercising, saw two street groups playing lovely music, people walking, jogging, exercising, some young couples co-hi-cooing....... time will fly.Our city tour ended here around 4 PM(would be wise to ask your guide to end here, you can take it on yourself for the next 2-3 hours) we crossed the wooden bridge to the temple. Temple too is better preserved then many others we saw, the story of Tortoise is pretty interesting; they said the dead one lived for 300-400 years and another one lives in the lake (300 year old!!) and gives Divine appearance to special people, so you can try your luck :) The wooden bridge looked like the best spot for clicks; saw lots of wedding gangs clicking away in all poses. We (me and wife) were lucky to be staying 3 minutes walk from the lake and spend some time in the evening on all 3 days just sitting and watching life flow by; you can get an idea of Hanoi cross-section of life; the rich, middle class and also the poor are seen chasing bread and pleasure. There's a great department store \"Intemex\" from were we picked up fruits, drinks and stuff. One day we took a Cyclo tour 4 USE for 2 hours, you sit on the cycle and the man pedels it into the maddening small streets; scary stuff how they drive and zig-zag through traffic. From in front of the cycle if you catch the video and show it to people they're not going to believe such a place in the world exists, I shot about 15-20 minutes of it, everyone who saw said like....'what a ride\". Take this ride without fail.If you don't like noise, crowd, dust and mist.... this is not the place for you. ======="

We could not get tickets to the water puppets show as tickets are pre-booked a least few days to a week ahead.A calm oasis and place to jog, or just relaxt along the benches."

Fresh air in the morning at Hoan Kiem lake and walking around this lake is one of the good reasons for me to come back to HaNoi for the second time: It is quite romantic in Hoan Kiem lake in the early morning and that is the same feeling I had when I walked around the river in the centre of Paris or around the lake Lugano in Switzerland in the early morning. However, it is much warmer here in Hanoi ! By the way, try different tasty fruit juice or ice cream at the fruit bar at the beginning of the lake near the small pagoda. They are jummy !"

I never saw any turtles and with the water so nasty I'm not sure how anyone could.

Compared to walking the motorbike infested streets of the old quarter, the lake offers a chance to just enjoy a stroll for a change. That part we like about this lake. There is also a decent temple to visit (10,000 dong) over the red bridge but its nothing particularly special. Otherwise, the water of this lake is in really bad shape, much like it was five years ago. Its a toxic, mutant ninja turtle, sort of green color, seems little has changed. This is too bad as this could easily be a major attraction for Hanoi. I don't quite understand why the city doesn't invest a bit of finance to cleaning and adding a fresh water system to freshen up this lake. For the poor quality of the lake water, we don't recommend this attraction. However, for a peaceful stroll, it may be your only option as Hanoi has so many people, motorbikes and now cars!!!"

It's a cool place to relax... no wonder it's a popular hang out place among the locals and also tourists. Walking distance to Old Quarter but be careful of the heavy traffic when you cross the road.

This is the center of the tourist area in Hanoi, where you have restaurants, souvenir shops, cyclo tours, water puppets, and everything else touristy in the Old Quarter of Hanoi. It is a natural spot for this, as it's located right in the middle of the Old Quarter, and is beautiful. You can go early in the morning and walk around the lake, watching people do their exercises, and visit the temple without the crowds. The temple itself is interesting, but not essential, the cute wooden bridge out to it is about as interesting. If you're there in the afternoon, and don't want to stand in line to see the temple, don't lose sleep over it. The lake itself isn't really an attraction per se - it's just a nice place to walk, relax, and soak up the ambience, then hop across the street, see the water puppets, take a cyclo ride, eat, drink, and shop.Take the same common sense precautions with pickpockets here as anywhere. Don't walk with purses or fancy jewelry or things like that around SE Asia in general - there's no reason to as nobody but you will have it, and it's just an invitation for problems, not just here but anywhere in the developing world. There is not an extra cause for concern here vs. anywhere else. Relax and enjoy one of Hanoi's top attractions."

Not so much hassle from hawkers either - and on that note, wanted to second burlington_gal's warning, and say that this is a real place to be extra wary. Beautiful place, really lovely to see, but an absolute hot spot for extremely practised thieves, who seem to provide a bit of theatre for Vietnamese onlookers. In just a moment - as you're speaking on the phone, or when hawkers are hassling you - their hand has crept into your bag, usually because they have watched you put something away and followed you closely waiting for (or helping to create) a moment of inattention. They really are so deft and speedy that even a seasoned traveller can be caught off guard; this really is one of the worst spots in Hanoi I've found for repeated attempts at theft. A real shame because the Vietnamese are so friendly, generous and welcoming, and Hoan Kiem is a must-see..."

Also being the same place as the red bridge, the most photographed bridge in Vietnam (or so I am led to believe) I was more than happy to include the temple into my sightseeing. I am so very glad we did as it was just incredible. Seeing the huge turtle & having a wander through the temple was great. Even just the enterance into the temple had me snapping away like crazy on my camera. After our trip through the temple, we went for a walk through all of the local streets which are arranged in different items eg belt street, shoe street, shirt street etc. So depending on what you are looking for you should be able to find it here. We did go to a two story market which we were told by a local was really good, but we were quite disappointed as did not seem to cater to the tourist shopper very well.There are heaps of places to eat & drink around the lake so you shouldn't have trouble finding something that you like.
