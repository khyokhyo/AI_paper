We booked the tour with SiemReap Shuttle tours as they were providing best deals and interesting itinerary to cover best temples in 1 day trip. Our guide Chanthy was really fun, sharing interesting details and answering all our questions. As well as taking care of needs of everyone in the group to make experience of Angkor Wat great and memorable to all of us!"

We really enjoyed our full day with him. He's a funny guy and provides the right balance between giving you the necessary information and allowing you to explore the temples at your leisure.The 2nd day we did the sunrise tour with Mr Sopheap. He has a slightly different style but was equally excellent and is so knowledgeable on both the temples and Cambodian history as a whole. He also can provide great tips on where to take the ideal photos when you're there."

I didn't understand half of what our guide said. He was very sweet and had a great sense of humor, and had a bachelor and Masters degree in history. He knew much on Camdodias history in general and on the various Temples stories. But like I said, his English wasn't good.We booked a Tour where we joined a mixed group. It costed 15$ and Then you pay additional 20$ for entering the Temples. There was free water on the bus, and we stopped for lunch after the first temple. It was a local restaurant with good food. Nothing special about it, but it was good. We paid 6$ for food and drink."

Speaks very clear English and is quite the joke cracker. He's been guiding around Cambodia for many years so can answer pretty much any question you can throw at him. Service to and from the hotel was on time, the van was clean and AC worked well. If you didn't get your Angkor Wat ticket the day before they take you to the ticket office on the way up. A one day pass is 20 USD and a 3 day pass is 40 USD, on top of the tour. We chose to do the half day tour because it was in our price range (12 USD) and if you enjoyed the temples so much and want to stay on after the tour and explore yourself you can. For us 8 hrs was enough but if you know a bit more about the temples or have more time pick a multi day pass and break it up. I feel completely satisfied with our half day and would highly recommend it to everyone, even if your not the temple or history type you definitely won't regret it."

In fact, this tour service was the only one I used during my week stay in Siem Reap. He was my guide for Angkor Wat as well as for Koulen Mountain / waterfall.Mr. Sopheap was cordial, approachable, and informative in describing the history and architecture of Angkor Wat and the other temples. Possessing a Master\u2019s degree in History, he was also able to explain many of the stories detailed on the bas reliefs sculpted into the sides of the temple walls.Furthermore, he would augment this information not only with videos and pictures from his phone, but also with personal humorous anecdotes from his time in the military. Apparently, he was also once a monk! Especially helpful was his short video clip on the \u201cChurning of the Ocean of Milk\u201d in order to visualize the imagery. Finally, I appreciated his small efforts to make the tour more comfortable, safe, and entertaining. During our Phnom Kulen trip, he tipped the small child who \u201clooked after\u201d our shoes for us while we were away barefoot inside the temple of Preah Ang Thom, and he paid the local \u201ccontainer keeper\u201d to rent the box that ensured our belongings would be secure and dry when some of us dipped into the waterfall pool. He was also the only one of the guides to take group photos of all the tour members, with his own phone nonetheless, and fulfilling his promise to send them to any one of us who wanted them. Thank you for an enjoyable trip, Mr. Sopheap."

Sop heap was our guide and he did a good job- he had all the facts and figures, which is what I enjoy. Regarding the tour - and it's just my opinion- I could have done with waiting 2,5 hours on the hill waiting for sunset, which didn't happen because of cloud cover- it is just too hot here to do this! I came to see Angkor Wat and ended up loving Ta Prohm the best!Just a reminder that this does exclude the entrance fees."

He spend the whole day with us and anticipated his tour t our wishes. e will recommend Chanthy 100% to other visitors."

He showed us many different temples and we were taken off the beaten track where it was quiet. The tracks were most of the time well shaded. Interesting facts were mentioned and if there was no documentation on certain temples he was honest and did not make up things just to give info.Chanty is a well informed, friendly and relaxed guide who was also very inventive and helpful making pictures from different and unusual angles. I definitely recommend this company for your future temple tour in Siem Reap!"

My tour guide was excellent his name is Chanthy. We had a great time. His English is really good as well as his knowledge. It was also really fun as he has a good sense of humour and is keen to take you to the best spots.

There were 5 destinations on the tour but really only 3 good ones. The other two being a bridge to look at for 10 minutes and the sunset viewing (hoards of people with limited viewing of an average sunset - not worth climbing up the hill in the heat for).The guide was educated, helpful and gave relevant info in appropriate amounts. Always stood in the shade to talk and answered all questions.Down side, only one bottle of water per person all day which is ridiculous and just being mean.The sunset gig is a bit crap.Upside - a great tour to 3 amazing temples with an excellent guide.Yes, I would recommend."

On way from airport our taxi driver offered us a daily rate ($30) plus a guide if we needed (additional $35). Others said they hired a tuk tuk for the day ($15). On the evening of our arrival, by chance we came across an agency (Green cycle) who advertised the Siem Reap Shuttle Daily tours - the small circuit 1 day tour was $13 pax so we decided to go with it as an intro to the main temples. The tour worked out really well - our guide Chanthy was really great, easy going, humorous with a good knowledge of the temples. He had an easy manner that got everyone involved and talking to each other and because of this the whole day was one of the most enjoyable we had on our holiday. The group was 11 in size, big enough to wander off at your own pace now and then but small enough not to miss anything that was interesting. The tour covered the main small circuit temples - it was well paced in that we covered the highlights and skipped some things that if added would have been overkill, not to say exhausting on a 1 day tour. Also the timing of visits, esp to Ta Prohm was managed very well such that it was not crowded and gave us plenty of space to look around. It so happened that we re-visited Ta Prohm next day ourselves via a tuk tuk to get another look and see some the things we missed and could hardly move because of the crowds at the time we arrived there. Really happy we took this tour and would recommend to anyone."

They are professional and attentive from the time they pick you up at your hotel, until they drop you off in the evening. For the same cost as renting a tuk tuk for the day, with no guide to show you all the highlights and history, you get picked up, shown around by excellent, knowledgeable guides, cold water and all the history of Cambodia and the temples! Definitely worth the $13- $15! We went on two tours with this company. The first was the Banteay Srei tour which showed us 5 of the lesser known Angkor temples. Our guide Pheorom was wonderful! Very knowledgeable and friendly, always smiling and answering all our questions patiently and thoroughly as well as educating us about interesting miscellaneous info throughout the day, as this tour involved much greater driving time and distances, as well as volunteering to take many of our photos at all the great spots. The second tour was the Angkor Wat tour that covered Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Ta Prohm, and sunset at Bakkeng. Our guide was Chanthy, who was also very knowledgeable about Cambodia, and the temples history, and very funny! Very upbeat with very clear English. He made sure we saw all the highlights and hidden spots and suggested many great photo spots to us. This tour is a much longer day and tiring and he kept us all going!"

Maybe You had to be there, but the customer was rude. Mr C. just rolled with it and We had a great time. I really liked this tour. You are not going to have buyers remorse because You cant go any cheaper. I would recommend this tour over a private tour unless You just have money to burn, and I also enjoyed meeting people on the tour. Thanks Mr. C. ! Great Job.

I needed more time and definitely wanted more history of the temples. I decided to take Shuttle Tours which was listed on a free map I got at my hotel. It was pretty much the same price I paid for my tuk tuk driver just to drive me around to the temples of the Small Temple Tour but slightly less at $13. They provide transportation and a few waters and a knowledgable guide (you can get guides at the temples if you just use a tuk tuk drive but they charge $10-15 per temple). Note: this doesn't include the Temple Pass which you need to buy separately, which is usually the case.I took the Small Temple Tour in English. We visited Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Ta Prohm and then Bakheng for the sunset. We stopped for lunch too, although it seemed like all tours/tuk tuk drivers bring the tourists to the same restaurants which are priced a little higher for the area. So keep this in mind if you are on a strict budget, maybe bring or get your own snack elsewhere.I felt that the tour was money well spent, and wished I had done this my first day. My English tour was led by Chanthy with a group of 11 travelers from around the world. Our group was possibly smaller than some, since we we were picked up at our hotels by a bigger bus; then transferred to a smaller van which seated 12. Chanthy was awesome. He was knowledgeable, and in addition to the having a solid tour, he would answer additional questions with ease. He knew his material. :) Also he was fun and funny, although yes I will admit, some of the jokes a little on the corny side. Not to bad though; he was entertaining!! He was easy to hear, follow and understand. He was also a great photographer, directing us to take several group photos, as well as offering to take pictures for us solo travelers. He always made sure to look out for everyone, so no one was left behind or lost. He even went to buy a few of us waters, at places with no re-entry.I definitely would recommend this Small Temple Tour for those with limited days, and especially for those who want to know/learn some history about the temples and the religion. I thought it was money well spent. It included transportation to and from our hotels and to the temples and most importantly a fun, funny, and knowledable guide. Highly recommend, especially with Chanthy."

We were picked up on time and taken to meet our guide, Chanthy, then boarded the bus. What followed was just fabulous. Chanthy was an extremely knowledgeable guide, he imparted his knowledge in a friendly and humorous banter and there were no questions he could no answer. He ensured we were comfortable at all times, supplied cold water when we needed it and, although it was a very long, day he kept us inspired to see more. We can highly recommend this tour. We were fortunate enough to have Chanthy as our guide the following day for a tour to the Floating Village and by then we were old friends."

Mr. Kim speaks English very well and has intricate knowledge of the entire complex, explaining the history and details of every aspect. I especially enjoyed the Ramayana tableau, the center of the universe, the dinosaur carving, and Mr. Kim's great sense of humor and photographic skills. The tour was also well paced to avoid crowds when possible and to get some rest breaks."

For $18 us you couldn't ask for a better mornings entertainment.The trip started with a people mover doing the rounds of the local hotels and dropping us back at the tour HQ where we were split up to go on our separate ways.There ended up being six passengers, the driver and our tour guide Cherry.Kampong Pluk is a village on stilts on the shores of Tonle' Sap a massive lake and river system.As we drove in Cheery explained that during the dry access is gained via road. During the wet the tour is via boats as the whole area is submerged.While it would have been great floating through the village and forest in a small boat , looking up at all the dwellings from ground level was interesting to say the least.After visiting the village we boarded a small boat and motored down the canal and out onto the lake. plenty of fish farms and a few floating eateries, we had lunch on one, wasn't bad either. They had a few live crocks in a cage attached to the end of the floating platform.From there it was back to the village our transport and home.A good tour enhanced by Cherrys commentary."

Me and my bf had a great time when we joined the big angkor wat tour .I love these temples structures, histories as well as meanings in each temple.My tour would not be so great if we did not had an exellent tour guide such as Mr. Chaya Kim. He explained to us in a very clear and entertaining way everything there is to know about the temples, he's funny and knowledge. He works with enthusiamn and alot of passion which always reflects on the entire tour that is what we liked about him.The tour group contained only 6 people which was great. It felt more like a private tour.The only thing I didnt liked was the overpriced lunch. I only ordered a drink and skipped it. I would recommend sandwiches.Also the last part visiting a village where palm sugar is being made was a complete waste of timeIt was more like a vendor street where locals try to sell their products to tourists.But luckily we werent forced being there for a long time around 10min and that was it so i guess its ok. All in all i would recommend this tour with mr.chaya kim and thank you so much for a great day."

Our tour guide Chaya Kim was fabulous and had a lot of knowledge about the history of the temples and background information about Hinduism / Buddhismn. He took the time to draw a map in the dust to explain to us the basic layout out the temples before entering that helped us enormously to understand the temples itself.He walked with us all the way and explained us in detail the cravings and the many symbols and showed us the best spots for pictures.At one point I got a little bit lost with all the names of the gods shivas nagas etc.but I took the time after the tour to do a bit online research and now it makes so much sense. Thank you Chaya for a great time. My gf and I enjoyed the tour with you and we would recommend his service any time!Negative points: We did not like the lunch break, don't get me wrong the food wasn't so bad but totally overpriced. I would recommend to pack some sandwiches as the tour is long and the weather is hot you dont want to stuff yourself with food anyways just makes the afternoon program only harder for you."

He also sent some pictures afterwards to the group. Thumbs up for Chanty!The small circle tour itself takes from 8:30 to 18:30 and costed usd 13 pP incl pickup and dropoff. We visited angkor Wat, Bayon temple and the one with the many roots covering temples. At the end ther was opportunity to see sunset at the famous hill but in my eyes its not worth it. There is no relation to the temples, just a sunset with many people, a long queue and waiting time. I recommend to just stay in angkor wat and watch ot from there...Tour bus was ac'ed, water provided, all great. Thanx"

We were picked up on time, and left right on schedule. Our guide, Mr Chahiya was very knowledgeable, and he knew the ins and outs of Khmer history and the intricacies of the Angkor site. He made the trip very interesting for my two primary school aged kids, and he did not bat an eyelid when they started prancing about, but he engaged and entertained them, and calmed them down. A lady in our group fell ill, and he consistently checked on her throughout the rest of the journey. The only drawback was the lunch - which took too long as service was horrendously slow - and due to this, we missed the opportunity to view Angkor Wat from a vantage point at Bakheng Hill. Our second trip, this time to the floating village of Kampong Phluk was just as pleasant, and we really enjoyed ourselves. A great tour company if you do not mind walking around in groups of 12 to 20 to just get a taste of Cambodia."

My husband and I don't usually like organised tours but we were feeling anxious about finding our own way out to the temples because we'd had a back experience somewhere else (not in Cambodia), so we booked a one day Angkor tour with Siem Reap Shuttle Tours through the Tourist Information Centre. We had a fantastic time! There were about 20 of us in the group, a real mix of people, and Chanthy broke the ice and got us all chatting so it wasn't awkward at all. Chanthy is a great story teller, very informative and quite funny too! He was also very good at keeping the group together, which must have been challenging, no one was left behind!There is quite a bit of walking to do, but Chanthy kept us updated along the way and gave us options to suit all fitness levels.Our driver was a friendly chap and the shuttle was air conditioned with a cooler full of water bottles. The place we stopped for lunch was nice as well, and not a rip-off as you would expect.I feel like we saw all we needed to see (Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Bayon, Angkor Thom, sunset) with plenty of time to take photos and lots of learning and history. I would really recommend this trip for a full and hassle free experience."

I was picked up promptly at 8:00 by minibus and taken to their office where I joined 4 other tourists in a minibus capable of taking 9. In the morning we visited Pre Rup, East Mebon, Ta Prom and Preah Khan before stopping for lunch. We then went on to see Banteay Srei. All sites are definitely worth a visit and can be done in one day. What made this special was our guide, Kim (Chhayakim); his english was excellent, as was his knowledge of the sites, and he responded to our requests (for instance if you wanted more on history and less on indian religion, he obliged). I asked him about the temple complexes further away, and although the company didn't usually operate to these, he arranged a trip for us the next day. With him and the driver/minibus we paid $160, and 4 of us shared the cost (6 would still be comfortable); we drove about 2 hours to the near-deserted sites around Koh Ker, and then back to Beng Mealea in the late afternoon to avoid most of the tour party selfies. These sites are an absolute must, and for me, beat everything in Angkor, (one of the best days of my life), Again, it was the knowledge of Chhayakim (google him) that made the day, and gave a great insight to Cambodia."

His English is very good and he is very patient waiting for us slowcoaches to catch up, In all we visited 5 temples and had a lovely lunch in a rstaurant, The temples are amazing and the sculptures are our of this world seeing as they wete done 800 years ago.

He gave us enough time to appreciate and enjoy the temples and to take pictures too. His knowledge is amazing and answered our questions very convincingly.  I was separated from the group in Ta Phrom and was already scarred! But thanks to Shanty! He went out of his way to look for me!It is very obvious that Mr Shanty loves Angkor and love to see that everyone of us was happy and got the value of our money. We paid 15$ for a 1 day tour.

He was friendly, had a sense of humor, and did a wonderful job of telling us about each of the sites we visited. His information included history, culture, religious beliefs, and even several stories (and, even though I wear hearing aids and frequently have difficulty understanding, I could understand Chanthy). Due to Chanthy\u2019s guidance, I am sure that we saw some of the sites from the best vantage point and even did so efficiently because of his directions. He managed our diverse group very well - from the beginning when we all introduced ourselves and throughout the tour. Chanthy made us all feel welcome and comfortable through his friendliness and caring attitude. Even the food was great at the lunch stop. We appreciate this wonderful experience in Cambodia and recommend it for anyone who appreciates beauty, history, and culture."

We took several of the tours offered by Siem Reap Shuttle Tours as they were a relatively easy and cost effective way to enjoy the sights - even if a group tour has, at times, some downsides. The tour guides were invariably very helpful and informative. The highlight of our visits, in more ways then just the obvious, was the Angkor tour. Our tour guide was Rath Sopheap. Not only was he highly educated (with a Masters in Cambodian History) his English excellent and his knowledge of the temples immense, he was also able to impart to a disparate group of tourists the long and incredible history of one of the world's former great empires in a way that made it comprehensible. He regularly pulled out his phone to show film clips and pictures to illustrate his narrative, making it all the more informative. Aside from these talents, he was the most organised and professional of all of our guides, setting out clearly at the beginning of each visit how long we would be there, where he would lead us, and importantly, if people wished to go 'off piste' to where they should return and at what time. Even when a couple of over-heated Norwegians bailed out without telling him at the last stop of the day, he handled the situation with equanimity. Sopheap definitely made this the highlight of our whole trip."

I enjoyed the smallness of the group, about 10 of us and we all got to know a little about each other which was a bonus on this tour. The cost of the tour is better value than you'll ever get either going by yourself or joining a big group. I can't recommend this tour enough."

Chhayakim was our tour guide and I recommend asking for him when booking. I would use this company again if I returned to the Siem Reap."

They picked me up at 8am and dropped me off after a beautiful sunset at 6:30. There was free water on the bus and they kept us busy all day seeing one amazing place after another. And our tour guide Chanthy was very knowledgeable and entertained us all day with information and humorous stories. Sure the stories were a bit long but that's the way the stories were back then. I had recently come from India and Chanthy explained things better than some of the guides there. This tour answered a lot of questions I still had. And most of all our guide Chanthy with his positive, lively, and fun personality, made the day very enjoyable."

A whole day tour to the three main Angkor temples - Chanthy Touch was a well informed, good humoured guide though he might cut down the stories a little - eventually all the Hindu mythology just became too confusing!It's a good idea to go to the Angkor National Museum in Siem Reap beforehand because it helps orientate you - we went afterward - still a good visit, but we felt we would have benefitted hugely by seeing it beforehand.The only fairly pointless bit of the day was the final sunset thing - just a sunset frankly. Not a big deal either way - luckily the climb was very gentle indeed so not strenuous at all, but hardly worth the bother. You watch the sun set over a bit of countryside...It was part of a package so don't know if it was value for money but my impression was that it was pretty reasonable - anyway most prices in Cambodia seem remarkably cheap."

We're a family of six (the difference in age between the eldest and youngest member being 72!) and Mr. Chanthy, could satisfy all of us equally. He was a much more kind and helpful than I could expect a tour guide to be! Though this was more a family tour, I had planned to collect data for my research as well. He was a huge help in this regard! He could not only satisfy the entire family with his wonderful narrations on the temples of Cambodia but also quench a huge part of my thirst with detailed explaination and discussion, and meet my (i.e. myself as a research worker) current needs to a big extent. Mr. Chanthy is open, frank, and extremely knowledgeable.A tour guide, as genereous, as friendly and as knowledgeable is rare to find!As long as my memories of Angkor Vat, and other temples of Siem Reap remain, the memories of being guided by Mr, Chanthy would linger!"

Even in Ta Prohm he was keen to show us scenes from the Tomb Raider movie, so we could recognize all the places that appeared on the movie! He was also telling jokes all the time and make us laugh, so we spent a really good time!If you think that's all, no... Mr Sopheap is also a creative man and talented photographer! A lot of times he suggested us to do some things so he could take a really nice picture from us! By the end of the day, after doing the small tour temple, we watched the sunset at the top of a temple and then Mr Sopheap and his driver took us again to the hotel."

On the 20th of December, my family and I (two parents, myself 18, and my sister 14), went on a tour to a farming village on the edge of Tonl\u00e9 Sap, guided by a friendly, passionate and well humoured tour guide named Sothea. The shuttle bus picked my family up from our hotel at around 8am, before taking us to a workshop in which local Siem Reap artisans construct intricate wood and stoneworks, before embarking on an hour-ish drive to one of Tonl\u00e9 Sap's tributary rivers. We were accompanied by two young boys who guided our boat through the river and the fishing village, and it was nice to be allowed to sit on the roof of the boat (as seen in the photos). The village was an authentic view of the lifestyles of tens of thousands of people in Cambodia. Seeing a small English language school in the village gave me hope that the people in this place, despite their poverty and reliance on seasonal presence of fish for sustenance, they still find time to invest in the future of their children. There is a lot to say about this trip but in short: I recommend it, and want to express my appreciation for our guide's enthusiasm and knowledge of Siem Reap, on behalf of my family. The only downsides were the small range of food available on the barge restaurant on Tonl\u00e9 Sap (not within the Shuttle Tour company's control), and sometimes being hassled by villagers to buy things. A must do if you go to Siem Reap"

In the beginning we aware this is group tour nothing in our expectation, this is the second time visit Cambodia so we had visited all main site. Finally the tour start, the tour guide gossip with the driver in Cambodian for a while then he introduce himself and his background (no information about the tour we are doing). The tour is boring and nobody in the group want to listen to the guide after the 1st stop, even he tried but we can't understand what he is explaining. He took us for lunch at local restaurant and the price is unbelievable expensive, basic french fried costs $4.5 in local restaurant in Asia?? I Just have a look through the menu and everything is overprice to compare to a good fancy restaurant we had dinner in famous Pub street. So of course only for tourist. The second day Angkor Watt tour; the tour guide is better, more knowledge and restaurant is the same, just for tourist. If you are not sure where to go and afraid of crazy scam transportation here it is good to do this tour so overall to us it's just ok."

He also provided us with detailed explanations regarding the history of Angkor Wat and we were very much impressed with his vast knowledge! He gave us enough time to take photographs at each stop and even helped us with our photo-taking. His great sense of humour didn't hurt either! :) We had opted for the Angkor Wat sunset tour. Mr Chanthy ensured that we reached the top of the temple in time for the sunset and explained to us that it was essential to be on time in order to get a view of the sunset. Hence, we were not disappointed! We truly enjoyed every moment of the sunset, thanks to Mr Chanthy! At the end of the tour, he ensured that we were all dropped off safely at our respective hotels.

The tour visited 4 major temples, including of course the Angkor Wat, whick was spectacular. Our guide was an English speaking gentleman named Chanthy. He was courteous, helpful, knowledgeable, and with a good sense of humor. The tour bus seats about 13 people including the driver. It was clean and quiet, providing a comfotable ride. Chanthy and the driver coordinated the drop off and pick-up at each location very well, so there were no excessive waiting. Lunch was on our own, and the restaurant was simple, and the food was very tasty and economical. Chanthy worked tirelessly in providing interesting info on the history of the various sites and helped taking photos for the tour members. The last activity was watching sunset from Phnom Bakeng. Chanthy made sure we got there on time because admission to the hill was limited to three hundred guests. We had a wonderful time, the best $13 we had ever spent.

Guide, Cherry, was pleasant, but not much banter on trip down, mainly on village walk. Trip in minivan takes about an hour then you board rather dilapidated boat for rest of tour. If you're feeling adventurous sit on roof but be warned it gets a bit of a worrying list from time to time! For those with an interest in engineering you will be fascinated by how they put these boats together! Ten minutes on boat to village for a walk and commentary then back on boat to the lake for a spectacular sunset. Along the way there is a stop for lunch or drink on a floating restaurant or alternatively you can spend the time going on a Sanpan ride through the forest for an additional $5 per person, we enjoyed. Wear old clothes if possible as you will get dirty, bug spray necessary and possibly hand sanitiser. If you struggle with jumping on and off boats and reaching the boat via a single plank jetty it might not be for you. The tour does have a downside as it does show a part of life that you may not otherwise see, a real eye-opener, photo opportunities abound. Without giving to much away we would recommend thoroughly."

I started separately for the sunrise at Angkor Wat then a short break before the tour. I use a Fitbit and did 22,000 steps! Exhausting but well worth it.Day 1. Kompong Phuk fishing village. Also, a wonderful tour, take the one that ends at sunset and do the extra $5 boat ride around the rain forest. I do not recall the guide's name, a lady and charming. She will even sing to you unless you pay her not to. :-)Day 3 Hulen Mountain and waterfall. Even if you don't bring something to swim in, you can rent for $1. If along the walk some adorable child comes up and take your hand, it is not because you are adorable, they hope to get a dollar at the end. What the heck, it's cute."

I heard other tour guides on the tour, leading other parties. They sounded boring though informative but our guide was funny and interacted perfectly with his guests. He cared and tended to our every need. I cannot recommend him enough. It was a pleasure to have him lead our tour. He is a must book, without a doubt. Adnan Bari and Yiesmin Haque."

Me and my friend booked two tours with this company through our hostel (Funky Flashpackers); the floating village tour (including sunset) and the tour of the big temple area around Angkor. Both days we had a great experience!First day was the floating village tour. We got picked up from our hostel on time with an A/C minivan. Cherry was our guide and he was great! He was funny, made sure everybody could hear and understand him (his English was really good!) and he told us lots of information about the floating village and Cambodian culture. It was a bit of a drive to the village, but the minivan was fine. After that, we hopped on to a boat and visited the village, which was a lot bigger and more impressive than I thought! Its definitely nice to visit. We also went on the big lake with the boat, saw the ladies on their smaller boats float by, saw some tiny crocodiles and (the highlight for us) some village kids dancing on some funny tunes! Thanks to Cherry for a great day!The next day we booked the big tour of the temple area, including 5 temple visits. Chaunty was our guide for the day and to our surprise, it was only the two of us!! Even though they had no other customers for that particular tour, they still took us on a private tour, no extra charge. It was amazing, we had a car to ourselves and Chaunty was an amazing guide. He knows all about the temples and he's a great storyteller. We especially enjoyed the story involving the baby snakes (you should ask him about it)! The temples were very impressive and we learned a lot. Thank you Chaunty for such a nice experience!"

I found the company well organised, prompt to pick up, good vehicles and had excellent guides.Floating Village TourMy friend and I did a half day tour to the floating village on the Tanle Sap lake. It ran from 2-6.30 with pick up and drop off running an hour either side. Our guide was Cherry, and our group was about 15 people. Our guide was very friendly and helpful, with excellent English and a good knowledge of the floating village due to him being from a nearby village himself. We caught the bus for around an hour down a very bumpy road and then got on the boat which was basic but comfortable enough. Cruising down the river and into the lake was awesome, especially with the view of the houses all on stilts and the floating pig pens etc. We went into the lake and then went to a floating restaurant which was a little more pricey for a drink (cheaper to buy from the lady on the speedboat that comes up to the boat). It is possible at this stage to pay $5 extra to go in a canoe with one of the local women through the floating forest but as it had been raining we did not it opt for this instead people watching. We then went to the village which normally had water up to the houses but as it was a dry year we could walk on the ground. There were lots of friendly people around and very cute kids who were dancing around. We then got the boat back and were dropped off around 7. Cherry was an excellent guide and I would recommend this tour to anyone.Big Circuit Temple TourWe did the small circuit and sunrise tour with another company, but went back with Siem Riep Shuttle Tours for the big temples. We were picked up from our hostel promptly and taken to the tour office, where one of the guides Cherry was very helpful in taking us to break our large bill money as Cambodia does not like $100 notes. When we returned we found a very comfortable car waiting for us as no one else had wanted to do the tour so it was us, our driver and our guide Chanthy, a font of knowledge about the temples, Hindu legend and Cambodian culture. He was very engaging, asking us what we were interested in, and told us the best stories. We went to 5 temples through the day, with a break at quite a tasty (but tourist priced) restaurant and in total the tour went from 8 until about 3, I guess because there were only two of us there wasn't so much time spent waiting for people etc. The temples were awesome especially with the guide explaining all the carvings and the history that went alongside the building. His English was excellent and he answered our million questions about the temples, the legends and Cambodian culture and history. It was a terrific day.I couldn't recommend Siem Riep Shuttle Tours highly enough."

Despite Angkor Wat, being what it is, I think a day with your run of the mill guide would've been a total drag, but it zipped by with Chhaya. If I didn't say it already, he's got superb English and he's really funny and personable.

She is an absolute gem of a host and tour guide. We experienced different guides from different companies and Sothea by far was a stand out performer. She was funny, had great insight to the people in the fishing village, a high level of knowledge, she sang songs on the spot during the bus ride there and back and just has a wonderful, kind personality and is perfectly suited to the tourism and hospitality industry.

The flexibility to go to the places we wanted, and lots of advice about the time to be there.Lots of laughter and a great lunch at Rong Cham Angkor as we left Banteay Srei. An hour or so helping us look for Oude (alas not easy to find). The second day we wandered out to Beng Mealea, Chanthy's favourite and a beautiful place to wander. Another sortie to search for Oude.If you want someone who will happily tailor your visit to temples, listen and advise, and generally go out of their way to make sure you have a great trip, Chanty and Siem Reap Shuttle tours are the perfect choice."

Don't forget to take your bathers or you can rent bathers for men and women $1us and 50cents us for the change room. It is a very interesting trip... Have fun and thanks for reading my review."

I did a day trip, a shared shuttle tour, to get a bit out of Siem Reap and go into the mountains to see the Kulen Waterfall, reclining Buddha statue, and the one-thousand linga river. It was great to go to the countryside and mix it up a bit. My guide was Cheri (spelling?) and he was excellent in answering all of our questions and giving us a comprehensive background to everywhere he took us to. If you are \"templed-out\" and want to see something a little different, I suggest the Kulen Waterfall. It's enormous and beautiful and you get a good glimpse of the locals enjoying it as well. Bring a swimsuit if you feel adventurous and want to swim, it's always nice to have the option. I would say locals easily outnumbered the tourists here so that was a nice change as well. I would absolutely recommend this tour."

I booked the tour to the floating village near Siem Reap and when the tour guide picked me up, he told me that I'm the only person who booked the tour. But still, I could do it and in the end it was one of the best tours I did, during my whole trip in Asia. We hold very interesting talks about the culture in Cambodia, while boating to the village and I had the feeling that I'm not only the tourist who tries to see Cambodia as it is, but rather that I'm right in the middle of it! After the stop in the impressive floating village, where the guide explained to me how the people manage to live with the different water levels, we stopped in a floating restaurant, where I had a taste of fresh shrimps for the first time. Then we were boating to the lake to see the sunset. We were one of the last boats in the lake and went back just in the end of the sunset, so that we could also see the floating village in the dark. All in all, I can really recommend to book this tour!"

The beauty scenery of Angkor Wat and the delicate architecture of Banteay Srey is beyond reproach. The tour was interesting because of an amazing tour guide Chanthy who explained every detail of the history on how the Angkor Wat was built. Chanthy is passionate and happy in his job thus, he made his tour full of zeal and enthusiasm. His humor made us entertaining which made the tour worth remembering. He is a great tour guide and we learn a lot from him. I myself was spellbound with this work of art. I can't imagine how the cambodian people made this wonderful masterpiece. Moreover, would like to thank Chanthy for your splendid effort in assissting us on the day of our tour and visit. To future travelers of Angkor Wat and Siem Reap tour please come and visit and create your unique memory of experiences. Once again thank you very much Chanthy for being with us in the tour.

Both tours were executed really well and for the amount paid i felt that it was money worth it. We managed to get a discount for the small tour at 10 usd per and 12.5 usd for the big tour. The highlight of the small tour would definitely be the sunset at the top of bakheng which was beautiful. As for the big tour, our tour guide Sopheap picked us up promptly at 8am at our hotels and gave a great self introduction of himself and the itinerary for the big tour. He was very well versed in modern history and brought us to places where really nice photos could be taken.To sum it all up, siem reap shuttle tours is well worth the money you pay for. I would recommend, 1 day small tour, and another day grand tour with them, and do a last day by renting ebikes to explore the places that you wish you could have spent longer.All the best for your test Sopheap!"

Water and towels are provided during the tour and a minivan is also used for the group. I was told the group would be no bigger than 8 but had 10 in the end... But that wasn't really a big issue. To book, you can either ring them up or go to one of the tour companies on pub street. Sept is not a good time to visit Angkor Wat however as it is rainy season... It was raining pretty much all the way through our tour and we certainly saw no sunset. Chanthy let us go up the mountain (15-20 min walk one way) to attempt to see the sunset amidst a heavy rainstorm. In retrospect he could've told us that there will be no view and suggest we head back earlier. I was told pick up would be at 8-8.30 but was picked up at 845, although they did ring me at my room in the hotel so I didn't need to wait pointlessly at the lobby"

He speaks good English, have sound knowledge over architecture and history of the temples, and what makes things greater is that he is also willing to share other info like lifestyle, political issues, religious questions, basically any topic. Full recommendation. Thank you."

Our guide Hoeam Phyrom spoke very good English and new so much about the temples that he made it a pleasure. It is a very long day but worth it at the end. Remember that you will have to cover up as they are still temples and people pray. The tree temples were the best bits for us. Tomb raider was filmed here and you can do some poses like Mrs Brad Pitt. An amazing day if you are interested in the history."

The guide spoke really quietly, had his back turned to half the group, and would often start talking before others had caught up. We left after 1 hour because we had spent 20 dollars on an entrance ticket and didn't want to waste our time with te guide. Inste we jumped in an official tuk tuk (with our lonely planet guide book). For 15 dollars the driver took us on what he said was the best 1 day route and we were very satisfied with what he choseGo to Angkor, but not with this company"

I say attempting because he was terrible, all over the road, couldn't even drive a manual attempting to take off in 5th gear almost every time, very rude, loud and wouldn't stop burping. Eventually we arrived at the lake after a 30 minute ride in the back of a truck, and it was great to see the lake, floating village and also the houses on stilts. That's where the good stuff ends, we had to walk quite a long way in sticky wet mud to get back to the truck, which Noone was prepared for or warned about. This made it quite difficult for some members of our group.After all that we arrived back at our hotel a full 2 hours later than scheduled, forcing us to rush to the airport covered in mud and crap to catch our flight. Do go to see the villages, just not with these guys."

At the beginning the tour was ok, the guide knows a lot of history but before the half of the tour I fainted because of the heat and the humidity combined with jet-lag. The guide went to look for the van to pick us up but he told us that if we want to come back to the hotel, we need to pay extra 10$, what is over-priced. On the other hand, these tours don't include the meals and they bring you to have lunch to a restaurant more expensive than you can eat in the city and lower quality. May be we were unlucky, but i was feeling so bad and he didn't help as much as everyone will expect."

The group started with eight by the end of the day it was only my husband and I. It started off quite well with the guide telling us a lot about himself! But after we had refused to buy the very expensive over priced lunch the whole thing went rapidly down hill. The guide practically ignored us and made it very clear we were some kind of nuisance in his life! He would drop us off at sites and say where and when to be collected with no other information about the amazing sites we were about to see. We have now watched many programmes since and we could have discovered so much more than we did. Highly recommend this place for a once in a life time must do....we will certainly be going back but not with the Siem Reap Shuttle company. Please watch any uTube coverage you can find before going, you will enjoy and get so much more out of your visit. A definite bucket list adventure..."

The guide's English was not very good, I ended up buying a book from a local vendor so I could understand what I was looking at. Several people left the tour before lunch time to \"cut their losses\" since they found it a waist of time. For lunch they dropped us off at an over priced restaurant while the guide went to eat somewhere cheaper. We all got up from our table after seeing the prices and went to another restaurant down the road that was equally expensive but gave us a \"discount\"The second tour was supposed to be a half day tour to see a floating village, killing fields and artesian place where they make small statues etc. this was the description given to us from our hotel and I verified it's on their website. They picked us up at our hotel, asked us to pay for the day and then about 30 min told us that we were no longer going to the killing fields but instead going to see the sunset. Several members of the group including myself were upset since they didn't tell us this before we paid. After much discussion, I asked for a refund for the portion of the trip they weren't providing and they refused. They then offered to take us in a tuk tuk instead of an a/c van, we all refused since what we were paying for was the a/c van and a guide and there was no room for him in the tuk tuk and he needed to go with the rest of the group if we were going to split up. Finally after about an hour, it was resolved by them giving us a full refund but we pretty much lost a day in our vacation since it was now too late to schedule alternative plansMy recommendation would be to verify the itinerary and the English ability of the guide before paying for the tripHave fun and enjoy a great place to explore!"

The price was also fair and I decided to go with them because of excellent service.Once their, I was promptly picked up from the hotel each morning and the guides and drivers took care of everything. I am someone who is using dslr for a while but only in first couple of hours i learnt so much about the composition, light, exposure so much! I loved every bit of it as we did different trips. One day i did temples and got beautiful pics for sunrise and sunset along with other classic shots.These guys are expert so they will take you to best spots in best times of the day for perfect light along with avoiding so many tourists.Another day we had an amazing adventure tour in the mountains on motorbikes where no tourist can go himself. We took pics at lost temples, warerfalls, monks praying in bat caves etc. It was truly mesmerizing.I also did tour for markets,night photography, street photography- people portraits what not!! Finally last day they helped me editing and working on lightroom software.These people are genuine and really nice company. They made sure i was comfortable, learning through out but at the same time enjoying.I can't thank them enough specially Regis who has been amazing guide and a mentor. I am so happy with the pics i took and places I visited. I would not been able to take such great shots and been to these hidden places without them. Hands down one of my most memorable trips and i will definitely come back. I am happy that i got to experience the culture, the people, the vibe and the sites of siem reap in detail and captured it all through my lens.Don't look further than angkor travel photography if you are planning a tour to siem ream and love photography!!"

My guide picked me up promptly at 4:30 and we were first in line to gain entry into the complex to photograph Angkor at sunrise. The tour is tailored to what you want to see, and in addition to photographing the most popular temples, I was taken to awesome temples entirely off the beaten path that were completely deserted and for me alone to explore (can almost guarantee no other tour will take you this far off from the most touristy temples). My guide did a great job of taking me to the temples at their most \"off peak\" times, so even the most crowded of temples felt mostly empty. Additionally, I happened to visit on a Buddhist holiday and was able to see and photograph monks as they participated in a religious ceremony. I purchased a DSLR specifically for my trip to SE Asia and new very little about how to work it. While exploring the temples, my guide did a fantastic job of showing me the basics of how to work my camera, how to adjust for lighting, how to change the mood, etc., all of which vastly improved my photography during the rest of my trip. Although still very much an amateur, I feel much more confident to go out and photograph on my own now. It was a full day (4:30-18:30 with a break for lunch), and I left not only having really seen a good number of the temples, but also with a much better understanding of the types of photos I want to take, technically how to take them, and things I should look for when composing my shots. The tour was undoubtedly a highlight of my trip not only to Siem Reap, but to all of SE Asia. As a brief side note: I noticed that a lot of tour companies often poorly compensate their tuk tuk and car drivers, but these guys make it a point to make sure the drivers are paid comfortable wages. I can't recommend these guys enough!"

Perhaps it\u2019s because of my passion for photography, but the combination of tour paired with photography and great subject matter made it my ideal adventure. First there are plenty of itineraries to choose from. I chose a full day with a focus on the people of the Siem Reap countryside. At the end of the day, it felt like I had been out for several days, in a good way. I never felt rushed. Regis Binard, my guide and mentor, was fantastic at finding subject matter and interacting with those people I photographed. He spoke fluent Khmer with helped break the ice. He also had a very approachable demeanor which helped gain access, a key to getting great photos and more importantly, put the subjects at ease while I went crazy taking photos. Although I\u2019m rather comfortable with a DSLR, he still found ways to help make my photography better. At the end of the day I felt that I had taken some of the best photos I\u2019ve ever taken, all in this single day. Do not think twice about this tour, especially if you have the slightest interest in photography, it will provide great memories and you will make great photographs, both of which will last a lifetime. Of note this was second time working with Regis. The first time we focused on temples. He knew every nook and cranny of the numerous sites. Better yet he knew the lighting and when and where was best to shoot. If you\u2019re in Siem Reap to see ruins start with a temple tour. I\u2019m glad I did this. It even inspired me to return Siem Reap a second time. Final recommendation is talk to your guide prior and discuss your skill level, what camera system you have, and what you like/want to photograph. They are awesome at communicating with their customers, before and after. Again, this is a tour you do not want to miss."

Even though we lived in Cambodia for a while, and we know that February is a busy month for tourism there, Ale not only showed us a few places we had never seen before, but also helped us to revisit the main temples when there were far fewer tourists than we had experienced in our previous trips to the temples.

We are both recreational photographers but amateurs with respect to using most of the bells and whistles on our camera. We also love history! Though this is a photography tour, Chris gave us great information about the temples we visited and answered all of our questions.

The sunrise was amazing and Chris led us to a spot where we had great perspective on the sunrise. All the tourists went left, Chris took us right.Renting a tripod is an extra $5, much cheaper than the cost of carrying one over in my suitcase!Given the choice between tuk tuk and car, choose car for your transport. The heat is blistering, particularly of you don't live in a tropical climate. The ride between temples in air con was a much needed respite from the heat.Water is provided and it is cold.You can leave your purse or bags in the car while you are in the temples. You really just need your camera and perhaps some water. You also have to carry your temple ticket with you at all times, they do check.I brought both my DSLR and my Android phone with me. Chris helped me take great pics on both. I was more focused on the DSLR but wanted to post camera pics on social media. The pics I will include at the end of this post will be phone pics.Bring a few dollars with you for coffee (nice little stop after sunrise) or if you want to donate to receive a blessing from a monk. DO NOT give money to the kids asking for it, and there will be plenty. It keeps them out of school and dependent on others.The full day trip for us included 5 temples. One was so secret we didn't see another person there. Chris is a natural teacher. He helped us master a few of the basic principles that really improved our photos. If you are a beginner, this trip would work for you. If you are a seasoned photographer, this tour would work well for you.This was well worth the cost of the trip and the best way to see the temples. The best part is that we will have some evocative photos to remember our time at Angkor."

For enthusiasts to advanced photographers, definitely a great way to see Cambodia!For 3 years in a row I come to Cambodia, to do photo tours with Angkor Travel Photography and each year I learn something new from their team.3 years ago I would consider myself as an enthusiast photographer but still a beginner while today I feel very confident in my photography.Last February, I did a half day photo tour with Alessandro focusing in low light photography. He brought me in some local markets and in a pagoda where I could see how he was working and learn many tips on exposure to anticipate all situations. Finally, I will come again in August and I plan already to contact those guys for something new in a different Province (Battambang) or do some flash photography! My story shows that they can adapt to beginners (I was 3 years ago) to advanced photographer (I am now)! I definitely recommend them to anyone who want to learn photography and see the real Cambodia!"

If you want to see Angkor Wat without the crowds, get some valuable photography tips and advice and just have an all around relaxing, stress-free day, I'd highly recommend Chris and Angkor Travel Photography. He will create a customised itinerary for you based on your needs. Whether you want/need a lot of photography advice/tips, or just want to stay away from the crowds and get taken to the very best of Angkor Wat and the surrounding temples, Chris will organise it and make sure you get the very most out of your time. Even if you aren't a photographer, this is a good way to see Angkor Wat as Chris seems to know the temples inside out, the best times to visit each one, and is a pleasure to be around, which is important if you're going to spend a day with someone! I'm not one for guided tours, and have never been on a guided tour before anywhere in the world but I couldn't imagine seeing Angkor Wat and the other temples without having the help of someone and definitely recommend Chris to anybody planning to visit this amazing place."

Made me realize how much I miss being on the road, exploring, discovering and learning...I live in Singapore and it was my second visit in Siem Reap in less than 5 years. The first time, in 2012, I had a very bad experience with heaps of tourists in the temples - I hated my first experience in Angkor actually - So, this time, I decided to give it a second chance and I hired an experimented guide photographer from Angkor Travel Photography.Ok, I am not an experimented photographer but I always like to take pictures during my long weekends and my holidays so it was an added value to this 2nd Angkor experience. Before the trip, I thought I had a simple point and shoot camera but after 2 days with R\u00e9gis I learnt all the functions of my camera and its possibilities (a lot more than I could imagine). He was very patient and also showed me how to improve the composition of my images, trying to create stories.Beside the photography aspect, he showed me many hidden places during their tour call \"Hidden Angkor\" and a few times we were just the two of us in the temples. It was an incredible feeling! I also enjoyed better seeing again the main temples especially Ta Prohm and Bayon.At the end of the tour (the end of the the first day), I asked him if he was available the next day for another tour and he was! So, I asked him to do the Beyond Angkor to see the Tonle Sap lake, but he told me about the current situation in Cambodia and the severe drought. He told me better to change the itinerary and it was my highlights since a long time in a trip! He showed me literally Cambodia in a day . We didn't see any tourist at all but so many smiles... I loved it!I am sure now that I will come back soon and I won't wait again 4 years because now I want to see Cambodia during the rainy season and the lake. What I know, I will go again with Angkor Travel Photography! See you in November and thank you again so much for everything!"

After looking at other Tripadvisor comments and their photographs, and then comparing their results to other tour photography companies, it was a no-brainer. I booked a two-day tour via email, and this started a good rapport with Chris Cusick. During the tour, not only did I learn a lot, I had a really good laugh. Chris is patient, and explains the workings of the camera in a non-patronizing manner. He is certainly committed to his art, and encourages you to realize what can be achieved through photography. The first day was from sunrise to sunset at Angkor Wat. Chris took me to the less crowded places, and timed it so we could avoid the masses. During the long day, I was given the opportunity to appreciate how natural light changes during the day, and with it, how to optimally use the camera to capture those fleeting moments. Different locations provided working examples to demonstrate the fundamentals of manual mode. It was interesting to return to using the view finder. Chris taught me what the fancy science-y stuff meant which was being displayed on the monitor. Now I know what those squiggly histograms mean! There were many \u201ca-ha!\u201d moments. The next day, we went to the local market which was in stark contrast to Angkor Wat. We ventured inside a poorly lit market place, which surprisingly presented us with a feast of photo opportunities. There were many stalls; raw fish and meat were being prepared alongside hair salons. People were having breakfast around makeshift eateries. And all this under one roof, and dim lighting. Despite these conditions, Chris taught me how to adjust the manual settings to capture some interesting images. Just as our luck would have it, there was a power shortage, and the market was darkened even further. Stall owners casually switched on torches, and lit candles. Glints of light strained through soiled windows in the corrugated roof. This changed the whole scene even further to which Chris was still able to provide guidance to get even more compelling images. Later we visited a monastery and met a couple of monks to chat with. They were happy to let me take photos of them with their family of cats! In the afternoon, we went to one of Siem Reap\u2019s floating the village (which wasn\u2019t really floating at this time of year\u2026) It was another assortment of scenes; a wedding ceremony was on the way, children were happily playing in the dusty road, and a barber was trimming a man\u2019s hair. And further down the road, school children were standing to attention just as the national flag was hoisted. The weather was searingly hot, and I spent two days looking like Spongebob. But it was genuinely worth it. I have come away with a lot of inspiration and a set of new skills. I\u2019m in total agreement with the other Tripadvisors."

During that time we visited many great places for photography, beginning at Angkor Wat for the classic sunrise shot. We got there very early and headed directly for the lake to set up. When we go there, there were already people three deep. Instead of pushing our way in, Alessandro quickly directed us to a lesser known lake. We were first there and got the optimum spot. We ended up with great shots. We then visited Ta Prohm which is known for its symbiotic relationship with nature. He deftly brought us to the best spots for interesting photography. Later in the day while the sun was at its harshest, he rented a couple of monks for us that resulted in really nice staged shots. This is something I would not have done on our own. We ended the day at Banyon Temple for some great Buddha shots. All in all, a fantastic day of shooting, Alessandro's style of mixing some technology with art was perfect for us. I couldn't recommend him enough! It was definitely a 5-star experience and one I look to repeat in the future."

So I decided to book a one day tour with Angkor Travel Photography to refresh my skills. As I'm living in Siem Reap, I've visited Angkor Wat and the other main temples on several occasions. However, I've never been satisfied with my pictures of the temples. So I decided to return there with the help of a professional photographer and booked the \"Hidden Angkor\" tour. I got Alessandro as my guide for the day.I must say that this day blew my mind! Alessandro showed me the temples in a whole different way then during my previous visits. He knows how to be in the right spot at the right time and how to avoid the hordes of tourists (or at least how to be in front of them to make the perfect sunrise picture at Angkor Wat ;-)). But not only that, he took me to temples and other hidden spots (entrance gates and a pagoda) that I've never seen before. Which made me feel like a tourist again. :-)I also really improved my photography skills. Alessandro taught me how to make a better composition, how to get the most out of my camera in manual mode and how to make a picture in low light conditions (sunrise / sunset). His explanations were always very clear and the quality of my shots really improved!Conclusion: My day with Angkor Travel Photography was just amazing and I recommend it to anybody with an interest in photography! So my promise to Alessandro and the Angkor Photography team is that my camera won't be collecting dust anymore. And I will be in touch soon to book a second tour!"

This was my third trip to Cambodia in 3 years and this year I decided to bite the bullet and go for a photography tour to improve my skills but also to see all those magnificent temples through the eyes of a professional photographer. I would not call myself an expert or a novice when it comes to photography but more in the intermediate-advanced category and even though I know how to use my camera pretty well I have always felt like I was missing something. I was recommended Angkor Travel Photography Tour by our tuk tuk driver who also happens to be our quad driver. Having been 3 times to Cambodia and Siem Reap, I wanted to go beyond the Angkor Wat complex and had my eyes set on Preah Vihear near the Thai border, 200 kms north of Siem Reap. Erik from Angkor travel photography tour was very helpful in responding to my queries and proposing some options. Because Preah Vihear is quite far, Erik proposed to stay overnight in order to break the trip but because I was short of time, Erik accommodated my requests and organised a day trip to Preah Vihear and Koh Ker. Well ! I can tell that it was a very long day, leaving Siem Reap at 5:15am and returning at 8pm. But it was worth it. Erik provided me with hints and tips on lights, angles, composition, etc. all those little advices that you can't get even from reading pages and pages of websites or books. If I compare the photos taken the days before my tour with Erik and those taken during the tour or after the tour, you can tell that Erik's advices have worked their magic. Little details that make a big difference in the final shot. Not only Erik shared his precious knowledge when it came to photography but he also explained us some aspects of the cambodian culture that we did not know and that were quite interesting.I would highly recommend Angkor Travel photography tour if you want to improve your photography skills and discover Angkor, Siem Reap and Cambodia under a different angle. I will definitely recontact Erik next year to organise a photography tour in the Mondulkiri region."

I highly recommend you book a day or two with him to see Cambodia from a different perspective ... and to snap some of the best pictures you'll ever take!He drops by your hotel the night before to ask what you'd like to see. I requested a mix of \"ancient\" and \"present day\" Cambodia. Ale delivered on both counts.The next morning we went to the atmospheric Ta Prohm (\"Tomb Raider\") Temple ... the place was practically deserted which lent a fantastic air of mystery. Ale knows all the nooks and crannies to find interesting perspectives for amazing photos. He's also always willing to accommodate the inevitable: \"Ale, please take me picture in front of this!\" He knows the best times to visit any of the ancient temples when they are the least crowded. Really adds to the atmosphere of your visit.Then, my day become even more special as we transitioned into \"present day\" Cambodia. We visited a monastery in the Angkor Wat area where we witnessed a Buddhist water blessing where a young monk kept drenching a family of 3 with water while chanting. The family was so friendly and accommodating, leading to some amazing pictures.After letting me chill at my hotel for lunch, we headed back out in the afternoon to the surreal village of Kompong Pluk, where all the houses are built on 10-meter high stilts to accommodate the huge rise of Tonle Sap Lake in the rainy season. An amazing site and sight to behold. We were the only non-Cambodians strolling through the village and the local residents were so happy to meet with us and chat. Ale speaks a lot of Khmer so he's able to connect with local people in a way that leads to fun conversations. Once again, the hospitality of the Cambodians was amazing to experience and lead to the best pictures of my entire trip.Thanks again Ale for making my trip to Cambodia special!"

They responded to my e-mail requests quickly and thoroughly and were open to pretty much anything. They offer several different day tours, and I sort of picked my favorites from each day and combined them to make my perfect day. This was absolutely no issue with them and we arranged a meeting point (we weren't staying in an easy to find place or they would have just picked us up).The price included pickup & dropoff & the fee for the tuk-tuk driver all day at a very reasonable rate.We went to the markets in the morning, where Erik seemed to know almost everyone. He kept up a steady stream of conversation and put everyone at ease while my husband and I started to learn the ins and outs of photographing people. He was quick with advice on the different lighting conditions and was happy to look at any of our photos to suggest improvements.Erik also spent some of the time taking photos, which made me feel very comfortable, like he wasn't just waiting around for us the whole time. He was constantly teaching us things both about photography and about Cambodian culture as we perused the markets and took photos.After lunch we went over to the Ankor Wat complex & met up with a monk who came with us to a nearby temple for photos. This was an amazing experience as not many people get the chance to take photos of the monks in and around the temple grounds! Afterwards Erik took us to some of his favorite photo spots around the temples. He knows just the times & places that get some of the best light with the least crowds. Here especially he taught us some techniques that we'll be using throughout the rest of our travels!We had so much fun that we decided to go again the next day, where Erik took us out into the countryside & the rice fields to explore some lesser known temples & to meet a lot of the locals. We had an amazing time out in the countryside of Siem Reap, it's a completely different experience!If you get a chance to go out with these guys, then I would absolutely recommend it. the value for the money is phenomenal. My husband and I are at different points in our learning of Photography, but Erik was able to help both us us equally. I feel that no matter your level of experience, Erik & Alessandro are going to be able to help you improve your skills & get some amazing photos of your time in Cambodia!"

We did a really excellent photographic tour, taking home unforgettable pictures thanks to the know-how and professionalism of the Tour responsible ( which is also a great photographer). We were able to take shots in fantastic places. I will surely return in Cambodia and will ask again the support of Angkor Travel Photography."

They took us around the outer circuit and the inner temples around Angkor Wat. It was a two day tour we opted for and we enjoyed it thoroughly. We opted to be picked up at our hotel and they did their best to fit in all our wishes for the places we went to. Mr Sam is a qualified guide with a wealth of knowledge for all the places we went to. We felt totally safe and had no doubt about the decisions he made as they all made sense. Mr Sam is also a skilled iPhone user and was a brilliant photographer on many opportunities for my friend and I.Mr Peng was consistent with providing us with cold water and ice cold face towels as it was steaming up on both days of our visit. He drove very well and we enjoyed his proficiency in handling the comfortable SUV. Our trip was made the more special by this wonderful and pleasant pair. I do not hesitate to recommend Mr Sam to anyone wishing to get the full historical and cultural value of wonderful Siem Reap! Thanks Mr Sam. Thanks Mr Peng!"

We booked a two day tour of the Angkor temples with this firm and met Sam, our tour guide, and Mr Siyem , our driver, early one Sunday morning. What followed was a wonderful two days of exploring both the beautiful architecture of Cambodia, nd learning about the history of this remarkable country. We were able to discuss architectural features in detail, Sam's knowledge is so extensive. He made sense of the symbolism and architecture in the eight temples we visited, and took some amazing photographs for us. Apart from being an excellent tour guide with excellent English, he proved to be a really pleasant companion to share our time with.Mr Siyem was attentive and helpful - Mr Never Late! He drove us in his luxuriously cool car to the temples and met us after each visit with courtesy, cold towels and a never ending supply of iced water. We really would recommend these two gentlemen to any visitor. Request them for an unforgettable visit to a very special place."

Our guide was knowledgeable, looked after us very well and explained us all about the temples and the history. One small negative comment is about the restaurant where they took us for lunch which we found very expensive compare to the Fine dining restaurants we visited during our trip. The local restaurants are very cheap compare to the one we went for lunch. After you check the prices in Siem Reap, you will find out the food in the chosen restaurant was excellent but overpriced. Overall we recommend Private Siem Reap Tour Guide when booking the tour in Siem Reap."

The temples of Angkor are breathtaking and the floating village on the Tanie Sap lake was fascinating but we wouldn't have got half so much from from our trip if it hadn't been for our wonderful guide Ms Saven and driver Mr Khom. We all learnt so much from Ms Saven - not just about the sites we were visiting but about culture and life in Cambodia in general. And crucially, she was able to keep our 7 year old interested and entertained along the way, showing him cool plants, animals and carvings. AND she helped our keen teenage photographer with great photo-spots. Ms Saven and Mr Khom were both kind and courteous and always prompt. Mr Khom and his van seemed to appear like magic just when we were just getting too hot and too thirsty - and his generous supply of iced water and chilled flannels was particularly welcome. Would definitely recommend."

Our guide was very knowledgeable about the history of the temples and gave us wonderful guided tours of each temple. We stopped at a local place for lunch, which was delicious and incredibly cheap. Then, we continued on our tour. Our guide also talked to us about the local culture and lifestyle of the Cambodians, which I found very interesting.

So take their suggestion to spread things out over two days!We had Sam who new everything and anything about Angkor, the surrounding temples and Siem Reap history too. He was partnered with 'never late' Null who was our very patient driver and who magically appeared with cold face wipes and bottles of water as soon as you left any temple! The two guys work seamlessly together and I can highly recommend them. Sam will get you into places quickly and efficiently and even show you the best photo shot places, whilst Null will ensure you have as little walking to do as possible. Be sure however to cover legs and arms. You will be asked by the temple guards to cover up so t-shirts with short sleeves and long trousers or leggings work well."

There are too many places, too far away, with insufficient signage, for the average person to do it herself. Angkor Tour Guide (this company, despite the name difference here), along with our amazing tour guide Mr. Sopheara Pheara and dedicated driver Mr. Thy, made all the difference. I cannot recommend them enough.First, the arranging: it was very easy to organize the tour over email from the States, and the company was quick to amend our 2-day itinerary to my location preferences. Pick-up and drop-off was always prompt.But most importantly, the tour itself: Sopheara was the best. He had a rich understanding of Cambodian history, culture, and politics, as well as great suggestions all around Siem Reap (especially local, off-beaten trail restaurants), and was eager to share them with you. There was not a single question I asked - and I asked a lot - over our full 2 days together for which he didn't have an excellent, thorough answer. He was also thoughtful: while our original itinerary had us seeing Angkor Wat on Day 1, he suggested we switch it, because the tallest Angkor Wat tower was closed that day for a religious holiday - instead, we went to see other temples much earlier than anyone else, sometimes being the first few people there. And he had a great eye for camera-work, kindly taking many treasured photos of us as many of the sites.Our trip to Angkor Wat was simply made because of Sopheara, without whom I would have barely scratched the surface of the hundreds of years of rich Cambodia history. I cannot recommend enough. Thank you."

We contacted Sam and he offered very reasonable rates and was able to customize a 2-day tour based on our requests. We also included a sunrise tour to Angkor Wat which is well worth the ungodly hour wake up call. Charges were on a per party basis rather than per person, which makes it even more attractive. One note is that Sam does not do the guiding and assigns various tour guides to each group. We had \"Mr Chang\" and unfortunately we would only rate his guiding as 6/10. (you might want to specify for another guide if you are taking the service).Mr Chang's guiding skills could be improved. His explanations were brief and during the tour he seemed more preoccupied to chat to other guests and travelers at the temple and his other fellow tour guide. He can improve his narrative rather than providing descriptions that we can also find in the guide books. Little insights into specific carvings would have lent a more in depth tour of the lives during the Angkor period.Also, they always include a \"local Khmer lunch\" as part of the tour. As we would all expect, these are tourist traps that charge high prices and low quality food. While edible, it is much more worth it if you specific a place in town to rest and have lunch rather than the \"restaurant\" that they would propose. Other than that, the car quality, service was prompt and Sam is a great person to deal with during the booking process."

The day we chose to tour Angkor Wat was also the first few days of the Autumn Equinox, which was apparently of religious and spiritual significance to the locals, who were already present in large crowds at Angkor Wat when we arrived before first light. Mr Chet was able to find us a way into the Angkor Wat compounds with no one in sight, and sat us on the steps of the south library with an unobstructed view of the Angkor Wat towers. Thanks to him we had a tranquil experience watching the sunrise. The quiet char we had gave us more insight on the history of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge and the local culture in Siem Reap. The rest of the day we explored Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and Ta Phrom. Mr Chet planned our route so as to avoid the tour crowds. With his wealth of knowledge of the temples, Hindu and Buddhist history, the stone carving depictions came to life. I could not thank him more for the experience gave us.

Our tour guide Bun met us at the airport and went right into action when I told him I had left my ipad on the airplane. He navigated the airport bureaucracy and managed to retrieve my ipad without incident. We bonded on the spot. Bun always went over and above what was expected from a tour guide. He was thoughtful and attentive and polite and funny, always very professional and personally approachable. When my sandels fell apart at Angkor Wat he bought me a pair of flip flops (wouldn't take any money for them) and helped me stay safe with climbing all the stairs for the rest of the day. He always had recommendations for shopping and restaurants and would even wait for hours outside of a restaurant to take us back safely to our hotel. If you want more than a tour guide, Bun is your man. He is working his way through law school and his English is self taught. He is very intelligent and knowledgable. He loves his country and even builds fresh water wells in small villages to help his people. He is honest, genuine, hard working and exemplary in all ways. You won't be disappointed. You can contact him at norakbun88@gmail.com"

Mr. Bunna was truly very knowledgeable and it was obvious from the way that he explains the various aspects of the temples that he is very passionate about its history.I would suggest that prior to visiting these temples, one should visit the Angkor National Museum. This would help increase appreciation of historical significance of the structures."

Pickup was on time and given the weather, he was well prepared. The drive to the Temple Complex was informative and he knew all the best ways to avoid the crowds. He was always concerned to explain all the amazing different periods at Angkor Wat and the other temples. As it was wet and slippery, Sam helped me up most of the stairs and was always concerned that we should take care on the uneven surfaces. His vehicle was excellent, and his lunch stop was a lovely family owned little restaurant that served authentic Khymer food, which was wonderful. He had cold towels and water available at all times, and having been taught English by an Australian he had no problem with our accents. I would rate this tour one of the best I have been on, and would highly recommend him. The tour was not the cheapest, but definitely value for money"

This is a fabulous company that I would highly recommend. The service was impeccable. Pay the extra $40 for a driver- 100% worth it. Angkor Wat is brutally hot, and getting into an air-conditioned car every so often to drive to the next spot makes all the difference! I couldn't imagine Angkor Wat without the guide and driver.... I think I would have been confused by the buildings and possibly passed out from the heat.THANK YOU MR. SOPHAT AND MR. SIYEM!!!!! Angkor Wat was one of the best days of my life, and you two are a big reason for that :-)"

He was extremely knowledgable about the temples, but you could tell he was extremely passionate about the history and architecture of the temples as well, it didn't seem like this was simply his job. But most importantly, for someone who hates tourists and loves taking pictures, Mr. Bunna not only took different paths into each temple to avoid congestion, he also knew where all these amazing angles for shots were that you wouldn't have been able to find yourself. Finally, and I can't stress this enough, paying for a tour guide is money well spent. These temples are massive and you could easily get lost in them and not know what you've already seen or missed. If you are on a schedule or have limited time, these guys know the paths to take to get you through the temples to make sure you see everything and not get lost. Yet at the same time, they didn't rush you at all, so you were free to do as you wanted also. Great time, friendly company, and an amazing trip. One last thing, suck it up and do the sunrise."

Note that you have to be dressed appropriately to be able to visit the temples (short/skirt under the knee and shoulders covered).We were glad to be able to visit the temples and Phnom Kulen with a guide and recommend this tour guide service. Although there was some confusion on the first morning as to the confirmation of our booking, the organisation managed to quickly provide us with a guide (with 45 minutes delay, but we did not notice this during the day). Ask for Mr. Chet as your guide and Mr. Peng as your driver! Mr. Chet is really knowledgeable about the history of Cambodja and all temples and always knew great spots to take pictures. Both are really friendly and attentive. Water and wet towels are provided and the car was air-conditioned. For lunch Mr. Chet will suggest local restaurants (where most of the tour guides will go to) which are not always the best, but we think you could ask to go elsewhere if you know a nearby restaurant."

Our tour guide Mr Van Lonh and car driver was Mr Siyem both such nice people and spoke excelent english. What we loved most about the tour is how they plan it so you can skip crowds. We even got to a temple where it was just the three of us and we got the whole place to ourselves. This is priceless, since everywhere you go is full of tourists, some of them pretty unrespectful of their surroundings. Everything was spectacular and our guide was pretty knowlegable in history and answered every question we had. We had great fun with Lonh taking pictures since he knows all the funny spots. They were really acommodating, on day on our way back to the hotel we stopped by the butterfly farm because we told them we wanted to go, this wasn't even on the agenda. The aircon car was a total oasis among the heat, we had a really tough time getting used to it, it was way too much for us. However I don't know if going in November would be better since it's supposed to be infested with tourists everywhere. The only con we could find was the food, but it's more of a Siem Reap area problem than the tour itself. Every lunch you go to a different \"local\" restaurant. The food was very good everywhere we went (you have both cambodian and western food and drinks everywhere) but a bit pricy. Everywhere we stopped for lunch was in perfect conditions and the food tasted and looked very good. Make sure to try the stew inside de coconut! We also found it not to be very traditional and we were really looking forward to trying some real cambodian food. However this is what we felt in general with all the food we tried in Siem Reap compared to what you get in Vietnam, so it's not really Sams fault, he definitely took the time to find the best places possible. On our fourth day we ended up going to the waterfall and the 1000 lingum site with just our driver (we'd already gone overbudget with the 3 day tour, we would have loved to have gone with Lonh too!). This place is amazing! One tip though, go in a car. Tuk tuk drivers will offer to take you, don't trust them, the road going up is a nightmare and we didn't see any Tuk Tuks, and the motorbikes we saw didn't look very safe. Thank you Sam, Lohn and Siyem for making our days in the Angkor area memorable!"

Punctual, polite and professional at all times, Mr Bunna was so informative and had a great way of enthusing our children about all that he showed us. Our three sons (ages 11, 9 and 5) were happy to ask questions and he was so patient and kind with his responses. He quickly realised that our youngest son is interested in animals of all kinds so he pointed out all manner of local insects and creatures that we would have missed without him. At Angkor Wat children are not permitted on the top floor so ours waited happily with Mr Bunna and listened to his stories. The car was always kept clean, comfortably air conditioned and stocked with cold water and refreshing towels. We saw beautiful sun sets and a sun rise over Angkor Wat, always from great locations and have lots of fantastic photographs of the 5 of us taken by Mr Bunna who has a tremendous eye for capturing beautiful pictures. At no point did we feel that we were restricted by a preset tour but instead felt able to make changes as we went and really tailor our time to make the most of what suited us best. This trip was worth every penny and I heartily recommend it to anyone visiting the area. If you are travelling with children, make sure to ask for Mr Bunna in particular - you will be so glad you did."

He looked after us really well, he was really interesting, excellent English and a good sense of humour to boot. He took some amazing photos of us which was the icing on the cake. It is well worth having a guide as the heat, to those of us used to the UK climate, is almost unbearable at times and to have cold wipes, iced water and air conditioning when we got back to the car was wonderful. My wife and I had a magical time in Cambodia and highly recommend Chet and this company, definitely value for money."

I would recommend having a guide when visiting the Temples of the Angkor Archeological Park. We chose Bayon Temple and Ta Prohm along with the landmine museum. Chet was a friendly font of information. He drove beautifully and enriched our visit with explanations of the history of Cambodia and the Temples. Thank you Chet for the cold drinks, cold wipes and great company"

He showed my friend and I ways to improve the quality of our photos (almost not needed because the temple sights are so gorgeous). We did a sunrise at Angkor Wat and it exceeded my expectations.Mr. Bunna also slightly altered the stops on our tour once he realized that my friend and I love elephants to include a stop at a temple with elephant statues. I highly recommend Mr. Bunna and Mr. Peng and will be looking them on my next trip to Cambodia."

From the outset Sam stood out by replying very quickly with a perfect and clear itinerary (inc. prices) for a two day tour. A day before our tour Sam contacted us to see whether we would like to amend our tour slightly due to part of Angkor Wat being closed for a buddhist ceremony the next day. We simply switched the days over. This was very considerate of Sam, thinking ahead to make sure we got the best out of our visit. All this before we had even met him! As for the tour it was exceptional and will be a highlight of our trip. Sam is very knowledgeable, relaxed and accommodating. It was great to hear not only the history of the temples but also about modern Cambodian history and life in the country. I cannot recommend Sam highly enough, his service, professionalism and prices are spot on."

Chet is the best and most caring tour guide I have ever met. With over 14 years\u2019 experience as a tour guide, Chet not only possesses EXCELLENT knowledge about the sight-seeing spots, but also is a kind and highly-responsible tour guide. He plans the tour with perfect schedule and great flexibility according to our needs and requests; and he is also a PERFECT photographer! He helped us on deciding the right spots to visit, on finding the best locations for photo-shooting, on which restaurants to go, on what local food (e.g. bamboo sticky rice, special coconut) to try etc. All these could only be possible with such a good tour guide as Chet. Chet is friendly, humble, always on time, patient, explains everything CLEARLY, speaks VERY GOOD English, sociable and hardworking. He loves his job and puts all of his energy and efforts to make your stay happy, comfortable and most important learn about their history and traditions. Chet has made our stay memorable and unforgettable. We felt that we were not just leaving a country behind but a GOOD friend indeed. I highly appreciate his great services and would recommend him to everyone going to Cambodia! I am sure you will be truly amazed by Chet. He can be reached at chettourguide@gmail.com.A big thanks to our driver, Thy as well for his exellent and caring service during our stay there!Rebecca L"

It was astonishing that Sam was able to keep it together and I and every member of the family had a memorable experience of a lifetime. It is quite evident Sam really enjoys what he does and meeting new people from every corner of the earth. This is what makes him such a tremendous guide and a genuinely nice guy. I am extremely honored to have had the opportunity to become his friend. Thank you."

This made a huge difference in trying to take photos. Ms. Saven was so endearing, that we actually felt like we would miss her afterwards. She knew so much about the history of the temples and was very engaging. If you share her interest, she will take you to other stops- like the \"killing fields\" memorial. This was touring on a deeper level. We also hired Mr Saroeun to take us to the airport upon our departure back to Thailand. Cambodia and Siem Reap will be a magical place we will never forget. Over our stay in Thailand and Cambodia, our visit to Siem Reap was our favorite stop. Beautiful country. Beautiful smiles. Can't wait to visit again someday."

The driver was very kind in providing water and cold towel, constantly cleaning the car, throwing out the trash, opening the door. When we opened the door ourselves, he felt bad because he was so sweet and wanted to do it! You pay a little extra to see the sunrise at angkor wat which we did on day 2. worth it to start the day early because it gets very hot! we started at 4:45 and ended just before 2 We were only caught in the rain twice for a very short period, so was very lucky! they provided umbrellas for us June is apparently low season so my photos were not bombarded with lots of people, i think it is a great time to go. it does get hot but you keep cooling off in the nice air conditioned car and at restaurants, your hotel. my visit would not have been the same if I didnt learn so much from Mr Chet, so I thank him for making this first time of mine a memorable one"

Took both rings I had bought to a professional jeweller and bingo not gold and not even emerald or sapphire, just coloured metal and glass.

I contacted Angkor Tour Guide well in advance of my trip, and told them I wanted a guide for three days in the Angkor Wat area which I determined to be the minimum time necessary to see some of the archeological sites. Mr. Sam got back with me and suggested an itinerary for the three days with an air conditioned car, driver and guide. I agreed to the terms and Mr. Sam requested payment in cash at the end of the three days. I agreed.I had Mr. Tay as the guide and Mr. Ping as drivers. Mr. Ping was exceptionally polite and really unobtrusive when not driving Mr. Tay and me to the various sites. Mr Tay was exceptional as a guide. There is really no other word for him. Infinitely polite, considerate, knowledgeable, patient. Just a terrific person to hang out with for 3 days. A guide is really imperative. You need someone to explain what your are looking at and to walk the sites with you. You cant go to the sites with you nose in a book. On the final day, after we had completed the tour, Mr. Tay invited me to a party at his friend's house where we drank beers and ate. I cannot tell you how flattered I was to meet Mr. Tay's friends. I am sure that all the guides at this firm are good. They are educated in the art, religion and history of the period. But Mr. Tay was simply exceptional. I was in Thailand/Cambodia for 20 days and meeting him was the highlight.Feel free to contact me with any questions."

Mr. Sam was very knowledgeable of the history and culture of Cambodia and answered all of our questions. Mr. Bun was a great driver and the transport van was always very cool and clean. I highly recommend booking this service, as there may be many other options upon arriving to Siem Reap, but many of those just from unprofessional taxi drivers offering their \"touring services.\" We were indeed asked by the taxi driver who took us to our hotel, whether we would utilize his \"cheaper services.\" He was very pushy and unprofessional. So again, go ahead and book a reputable tour service such as Angkor to ensure a pleasant experience in Siem Reap."

The only downside to us is that Chet was a little bit too much on his phone in some moments of the tour, but in general he was a very good guide!The temples is a must in Siem Reap, but having a good tour guide and service is crucial to get the most out of the experience."

We were there for two days and they provided all of the transporting to and from the airport and a full day tour around the temples and other significant sites. They were prompt and efficient every step of the way. The day of our tour we had Mr. Peng as our driver and Mr. Chet as the tour guide. Both men were friendly, gracious and helpful. Everywhere we went we were made to feel welcome, safe and comfortable. Mr. Chet's knowledge of the temples and surrounding areas was immense. I was pleasantly surprised thoughout the day as he able to explain the history and meaning of the places we were at as well as many mysterious architectural details and questions about daily life. I was able to modify our tour to include some out of the way places like Kulen Mountain. There and a couple of other places it was essential to have our guides as they were able to navigate and explain to us the meaning of the area, the local culture and translate when we wanted to interact with local people. The pair made the day a seamless adventure. As Mr. Peng pulled up the car to wherever we needed to be dropped off or picked up, Mr. Chet was ushering us to the notable spots for touring and viewing. There was never any waiting or miscue and therefore the entire day was spent efficiently experiencing the beautiful area. As well as tour guide, Mr. Chet is a pretty good photographer, alerting us to some cool vantage points and taking many photos of us. I was able to capture many more memories because of that. Two things that I was grateful for was that: 1. Mr. Chet kept our attention the whole time, never missing a chance to explain something about where we were at. I noticed other tour guides not as engaged with their tourists so I felt we had the best.  2. It seemed very important to Mr. Chet that we enjoy our tour and learn about the places we visited but also come away with an understanding of Cambodian life, past and present. He is very proud of his culture and his people and we are very appreciative that he could share that with us. If you go to Siem Reap you definitely should visit the sites and you should absolutely hire these guys for your touring."

We wanted to visit six temples, including Beng Mealea which is quite a way out, so we didn't want to rush to pack it all in to one day. First day Sam picked us up at our hotel at 5am for the sunrise visit to Angkor Wat. It was clear straight away that we had made the right choice as he guided us through the ticket booths and made sure we were in a good spot to watch the sunrise.Throughout the two days his knowledge was incredible and pitched at just the right level so we were all interested. Our boys learned so much and had great fun trying to recall all the stories and facts we had learned.Sam knew all the best (quieter) places to take us and Mr Sat just magically appeared with the van, cold towels and very welcome ice cold water at the end of each section.We really couldn't have been more pleased with our tour and would highly recommend Sam and his team to anyone visiting Siem Reap."

Here's my breakdown:Price: We reached out to a few different tour operators to find the most cost effective option. While relatively in the same price range, this was the cheapest option.English Quality: Haun spoke very fluent English. when comparing his English to the other tour guides we heard that day there was no contest. He was able to clearly explain stories and cool facts about the temples to us. What I truly appreciated was his regular inquiring if we are okay and if we are having any trouble understanding him. Additionally, Haun and I found we are both eager learners. he happily taught me Cambodian words and I taught him accurate pronunciations for more difficult English words.Knowledge: Haun is a very knowledgeable, prompt, and friendly guide. I am the type of person to ask a ton of questions and Haun was able to successfully answer all of them! what further impressed me was he was very willing and happy to be challenged by my questions. my girlfriend and I later found out that Haun is currently in school actively learning about the temples and is very ambitious to learn more.Safety/Concern: My girlfriend and I have traveled Asia quite a bit. this means we have dealt with a lot of characters and tour guides. I found Haun and his driver to be very friendly and incredibly conscious about us having a great day. some things that really stood out to me were these:1. Later in the day when I mentioned my girlfriend was tired. they were very willing to allow her to rest in the car. when I mentioned we were only around for a day trip and did not have a hotel, Haun nicely offered me his own home to rest - I didn't take him up on the offer, but that is very generous. we really had the impression we were being treated like family.2. After our fun day exploring temples and learning all the cool history and stories we decided to visit the market to go shop. Haun willing took us and even helped my girlfriend and I negotiate some great local deals! what wowed me on this side trip was my girlfriend forgot her iPhone 6 in the drivers car. when we returned the phone was sitting in the car next to the driver charging. I believe in a lot of places that phone would have otherwise been stolen, but these two gentlemen were too ethical and that is something I really appreciated.3. Haun and his driver were very accommodating to our needs. any time we wanted to take a break, get food, or even have a drink they were ready to provide. they even had cold bottle water for us throughout the day in the car. another aspect which impressed me was my girlfriend and I were very interested in seeing the sunrise over Angkor wat. Haun and his driver happily picked us up in the very early morning around 4am to make sure we could have this special experience.4. The most important thing I found when touring with Haun was he was not pushy. I find a lot of tour operators will try to sell you or take you to rip off shops - this was not the case here. someone who does not waste my time and provides a quality experience is always appreciated in my book.Personality: Haun is a young guy at the age of 25, very friendly, and aspiring to do much more for his tour career. I found he was a charismatic tour guide and did not steer us wrong.thank you for the fun day it is something we will always remember :)P.S. Make sure when booking to request Haun as your guide - he's a great kid."

Mr Sam arrived a little late on the first day due to a flat tyre, but he sent an email advising of this about half hour before planned arrived. Mr Sam is a very knowledgeable guide, and very friendly. He took us first to the ticket booth to buy our tickets (US$40 each) to cover 2 days at the temples. On our first day, we managed to see Angkor Wat, central of Angkor Thom (Bayon, Baphoun, Celestial Temple of Phimeanakas, Elephant and Leper King Terraces). We then stopped to have lunch at a restaurant, organised by Mr Sam. The food was actually really nice and about US$ 7-8 for a khmer curry. After lunch, we visited Ta Prohm and then we were dropped back to our hotel by about 3pm. On day 2, Mr Sam arrived just earlier than the planned 8.30am and took us straight to Preah Khan, then onto Bantey Srei temple. After this, we took the longer drive to Beng Mealea where we walked (climbed) through the ruins during the intense midday heat. It was so hot at 40\u2019c, but as usual Mr Sam had cool towels and a plentiful supply of cooled mineral water in his car. For me, Beng Mealea was not as impressive as the earlier temples, and if time is short I would skip this because of the distance and time it takes to get to. We had lunch again at a restaurant known by Mr Sam, and the food was impressive, and priced at around US$ 7-8 for a main. We were returned to the hotel around 3.30pm.I would thoroughly recommend Mr Sam and his company to organise your tour of Angkor Temples and the surrounds. He can also organise other ad hoc events if you wish, and I think the flexibility and personalised service offered is what impressed me so much. Thanks Mr Sam for a great time in Siem Reap."

Our guide was Mr Chhang and our car driver was Mr Saroeun and they went out of their way to guide and look after us in blistering heat. They arrived as promised at 5am to collect us for sunrise at Angkor Wat in an immaculate air-conditional vehicle and Mr Chhang ensured that he took us to all the best viewing points and photo opportunities. Mr Chhang is so knowledgeable about Kymer history and really bought Angkor to life for us. My travel companion, who isn't especially interested in historical sites, felt that Mr Chhang's information really made the visit for him. We moved onto Angkor Thom, and finally the 'Tomb Raider' temple. I can't begin to describe how hot it was on the day we visited but Mr Saroeun was always there with the car, a cold flannel and cold drink at the end of each stage of the tour. Their recommendation for lunch was also a massive success with plenty of vegetarian options. We had very limited time in Siem Reap, but this tour meant that we covered everything we wished to see in one day. Mr Chhang took some excellent photos of us, which we will proudly display when we get home and shown us things in all the temples which we wouldn't have seen with him (faces hidden behind the tree roots for example). Mr Chhang speaks great English, is highly knowledgeable and a really pleasant person to be around. We had an excellent day and would recommend this tour company to anyone visiting Angkor Wat."

We had Sam as our guide with Mr Sat as our driver. Both days were 40degrees but nobody complained as Sam guided us through temple after temple, explaining history, showing us items of interest in the carvings, etc. For us it was essential to have a guide through the Siem Reap temples. We saw many people wandering around on their own with their book in hand trying to figure stuff out and many of them actually asked Sam questions as we went around.Get yourself a guide and Sam and Mr Sat at Private Siem Reap Tour Guide are exactly what you need. Sam's English is great and Mr Sat couldn't do enough keeping us supplied with really cold refresher towels and cold water in the car. Due to the heat we decided to push on and do all the temples each day without stopping for long breaks or lunch and used the car to rest between temples. This resulted in us finishing early, just after lunch so we could go back to our hotel and jump in the pool and the guides could also get out of the heat. Great couple of days and highly recommended."

We booked through Sam, who responded promptly on emails. He noted the attractions we wanted to cover and worked out an itinerary to suit our needs and timing. His help was invaluable during the planning stage - several changes that we made did not faze him at all. Our guide Mr Chhang was punctual for our sunrise tour (5am!), and both he and driver Mr Siyem took good care of us, especially when I was unwell towards the end of the tour - too much sun for me. The historical explanations and interesting facts given by Mr Chhang were fascinating and made the time pass so quickly. We were very happy with the many photo opportunities he pointed out for us, and for the couple of creative shots he took of us, too! We were also impressed that he was very helpful and polite to other tourists who came to him from time to time to ask for directions!We would like to thank Mr Chhang for his patience in waiting at every scenic spot for my husband, a very keen shutterbug. Special thanks from me, for his calm and helpful manner when I almost passed out from the intense summer heat. I had insisted that my husband carried on into Ta Prohm (of Tomb Raider's fame) while I lay on a footpath resting. Mr Chhang gave him directions and instructions on what to look out for, and then stayed with me - no doubt making sure I wasn't stepped upon by the throngs of people passing by.We will not hesitate to recommend Siam Reap Guide Services to all travelers! Thank you very much for making our trip wonderful!Mr & Mrs R Choong, SingaporeTips: wear climate-appropriate clothes, with shoulders covered and pants below knee length if you intend to enter the temples. Comfortable walking shoes are a must, as are sunscreen and a hat. Drink plenty of water too."

Booked through Mercury Travel in the UK, we were extremely fortunate to be gifted a terrific Tour Guide for our time in Cambodia. Angkor Wat and the temples around Siem Reap have been a passion of ours for years; finally, we were able to visit them this month. After being pleasantly suprised by the efficient, modern airport in Siem Reap, we were overjoyed to be met at arrivals by our guide for our trip, the wonderful Mr Wibol Ek. He gave us a booming, friendly greeting and we instantly knew that we were in safe hands. He and his driver were consistently brilliant during the time we were with them; always punctual, flexible and able to tailor the schedule to our desires. They took us to the best restaurants, including to a magical display of traditional dancing. It was during the trips to Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and Banteay Srei, however, that Mr Wibol Ek's vast knowledge of the area really lit up our visit. He has an infectious, fun loving character that makes every trip joyful and memorable. He showed us all the best angles and places to take photographs and made sure that we captured the moment brilliantly. From a magical red sunrise over Angkor Wat, through discussion of the stories carved into the temples, to a wander through the local markets where we shared the best mango I've ever tasted, our guide ensured that we packed everything into our short time in Siem Reap though still retained time to reflect on the visual feast. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Siem Reap and would recommend the tour to anyone. It is a wonderful city buzzing with life, threaded through with an intense respect for the awe inspiring temples that draw so many tourists in."

And at the end of each visit we say next time we must go and visit Cambodia and see Angkor Watt \u2026 one of the wonders of the ancient world. Finally, after weeks of fog and midst in Ha Noi we decided to realize the dream in early April. Purchasing an organized tour from local travel agencies often appeared pricey. Then I stumbled upon TripAdvisor and their review of Private Siem Reap Guide Services. When I look at reviews I look at both the total number and the distribution. As of today I note 853 reviews\u2026 and 772 were excellent.... that is phenomenal. Based on that I wrote the owner Mr. Sam and email\u2026 told him we had never been to Cambodia\u2026 new very little how to plan our trip and while fit we are 66 and 71 years old respectively. I received an email reply in one hour with a suggested (3) day itinerary \u2026 cost break down with fees\u2026 a driver\u2026 SUV\u2026 and a tour guide. The price quoted was very reasonable. We concluded the trip arrangements that day. Using his website I navigated to an official government of Cambodia web site and applied and paid for our e-visas which we received in one day. We had a driver who met us at the airport and within 30 minutes we were checked in. The logistics and services provided live up to the 5 star recommendations.And while all these variables are key to successfully planning your trip\u2026. the real value comes in the relationship you form with your individual tour guide and driver \u2026 in our case three very full days. Our guide was Mr. Pheara\u2026. But quickly it was on a first names basis\u2026 which Sopheara is. He is an excellent conversationalist with a first rate command of English. He is knowledgeable on a wide range of subjects outside of literature, history and religion. We touched on such topics as agriculture\u2026 water resources \u2026. The upcoming New Year\u2026 and even the dark chapters in recent history that includes the continuing clearance of land mines (and yes the temples are save and cleared). What is daunting is trying to read about Cambodia before you arrive\u2026. The subject is so large to wrap yourself around it can become overwhelming \u2026.. History\u2026 the rise of the Khmer empire and clashes with its neighbors\u2026 Religion \u2026. The struggle and merging of Hinduism and the two branches of Buddhism\u2026 This is where I think Mr. Pheara is at his best\u2026. Over the three days he knew how to weave the history and religion together slowly so that we could begin to comprehend and appreciate why Angkor is truly a marvel to behold. Thank you Sopheara\u2026. For being our guide. I would also be remiss if I did not thank him for becoming our photographer as well. Of course my camera batteries died the first day. No problem\u2026 his high pixel panoramic camera took dozens of me and my wife\u2026 and he always placed us with terrific compositions in the background\u2026. Arm and arm standing before a pool as the sun rises over Angkor Watt\u2026. I am sure that will be our treasure from Cambodia mounted on our wall at home. He was always quick each day to email us our photos.And Mr. Sat\u2026 thank you for your safe and excellent driving\u2026. Especially on the longer 70 kilometer drive. You were always there when we returned to our vehicle with cool bottles of water and face wipes. This may sound a little trivial\u2026. But this April in Cambodia and by late afternoon the temperature had risen from the 90s to a high of 102. Water and pacing yourself if essential. The tradeoff for coming this time of the year (the low season) is that it will not be crowded and you will get a great discount on your lodging. Book early! It is rare to find this much quality \u2026. There is no hype in the reviews. So\u2026. Don\u2019t put of your dreams!"

We spent the month of February travelling throughThailand,Vietnam and Cambodia. The highlight of our trip was the time that we spent in Cambodia. Our guide Khemrint Kheng was outstanding! Loved him from the minute that he picked us up from the airport. He had an amazing sense of humour and was so knowledgable. He also demonstrated great pride in his country and respect for whose who visited. Visiting Angkor Thom,Bayon Temple and Angkor Wat was truly an amazing experience. I can't empathaize enough how important it is to have a good guide when visiting these amazing sites. Cameron( Khemrint) told us stories and gave detailed descriptions of the inscriptions on the walls as one example. We may have just walked by these walls had we not had him with us to bring the ancient civilization to life for us. Some our best photographs were also taken by Cameron who knew all the amazing spots to pose and capture highlights. We stayed at the Borei Angkor Resort and Spa which was a lovely hotel. Would definitely visit Cambodia again. Beautiful country with beautiful people!"

Not only does Bunrith have an in-depth knowledge of the great Khmer culture and temples but he also takes genuine pride in educating tourists on Cambodian culture, architecture and current events. His boundless energy, gentle encouragement and a great sense of humour kept us going even in the 40 degrees summer heat. He and driver Rosa, kept our spirits high with chilled water and wet tissues. And the SUV was comfortable with good air-conditioning. He also takes good photos.Don't hesitate to contact Bunrith if you are looking for a knowledgeable guide. It's an investment you won't regret.

However, the tour guide on the first day was coughing the whole time without covering his mouth. My husband and friend ended up catching the virus/bacteria and were sick for the rest of the 2 weeks trip. The tour company should enforce policy that sick tour guides should not work just in case they pass on to tourists who spend a lot of money to go on holidays.- Staff were knowledgable, had good English and very punctual. The tour guide on the first day was better than the second day. The second tour guide tried to give us a lot of information but we felt overloaded and sometimes did not have a chance to ask questions.- We had the same driver for both days and very happy with him as he was driving very safely.- We chose the Lexus SUV category to be more comfortable. The car on the first day was good but on the second day it was a much older car, the seats were uncomfortable and the car was rattled.Overall we were satisfied with the service!"

Sam is very hospitable and passionate - you can feel it in his emails, which are replied very promptly. Our guide is Mr Bun Chuop and driver Mr Ron picked us promptly at 5am at hotel. Bun is one of a kind tour guide (try to ask for him if you use their services). He knows exactly which spot to sit and wait for the sunrise behind Angkor Wat depending on month of the year!Best of all his humour lightens the mood and made all the walking and climbing seem easy. Bun speaks perfect English - he confesses he has never been to formal school at all - all learnt in Buddhist temple free classes and pure grit to want to be a tour guide (one of the hottest profession in Siem Reap). We learnt 2 things from him - 1) make a plan, persevere and smile; 2) how to take panoramic photos (yes, he is a fantastic iPhone photographer too!)"

The owner is also named Sam. Sam Chhoeun our guide was just FABULOUS...so knowledgable and patient and kind and fun loving. Mr. Sat was such a good and attentive driver and has a gentle nature and hands you an ice cold bottle of water and a cool cloth every time you get back into the car after facing the brutal heat. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH nice things. We travel A LOT and this was a perfect 10 all the way around. Also we wanted to make some changes to our itinerary (our son wanted to see the floating villages and also the first day we were just too pooped to hit the last temple and they couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating in making the changes). They were engaged and 'present' (and we saw plenty of guides slogging along who just looked tired and bored)...but NOT our Sam!! And Mr. Sat always was waiting for us with a smile. TIP: I had a bit of trouble hunting down THE company because Trip Advisor does not allow you to list URLS and there are other guides named Sam but know that you just need to search for Siem Reap Guide Services and the owner is Sam. Hope that helps."

            "review": "Tour guide crossed with angels?. We spent 3 days in Siem Reap, and we had 2 of those days allocated to do the Angkor Wat temples. After reading some reviews on Trip Advisor we just couldn't ignore the sterling reviews that Mr Sam had received. So we emailed asking for tour recommendations and prices and received a prompt reply with a customised itinerary. Each piece of communication after that was prompt and straight forward. Our package included 2 full days temple tour and airport transfers to and from Siem Reap airport. Every moment of our trip went seamlessly, everyone from the tour company turned up on time, and were incredibly friendly, courteous and professional. We had Mr Siaphon as our tour guide, and a driver to take us to all of the temples (sorry I can't remember his name!). Quite frankly our driver was the best we've ever had, and on potentially dangerous roads for the entire 2 days he didn't put a foot wrong, it was a masterclass in how to drive safely in Cambodia. Mr Siaphon was also an absolute star, effervescent energy and highly knowledgable of all of the temple's history and also gave us some gems of knowledge about the lesser known symbolic spiritual meaning of the temples / architecture which added to the magic and mystery of the tour. You just cannot help but be uplifted by his energy! And you'll need that as the heat and terrain can be quite tough even after a few hours. Even though we had a full itinerary planned for each day, we were able to do everything at our own pace and stopped off every couple of hours at a restaurant to get food, or to get some fresh juice from one of the road stalls. We had a supply of water and wet wipes in the back of the car too which were included in the cost. We went through about 10 small bottles a day between us. We travelled about 150km over 2 days, and it was great to be able to really see a good chunk of Cambodia. We stopped off at a couple of villages where Mr Siaphon, who originally came from a village, showed us how people made products such as palm sugar, so it was nice not to just be isolated in the back of a car/tour bus and meet some real people. He also pointed out various features of the countryside such as the bamboo ladders villagers use to climb the palm trees. Another gem that we would probably have otherwise missed. The price was $230 for the full 2 days and airport transfers, and while back in the UK we thought, ok its a bit on the expensive side, that idea quickly vanished after the first day when we realised that just simply having a decent tour guide and driver allows you to completely enjoy the temples and surrounding area, because it is so hot and humid, and energy sapping, you really don't want to have to constantly be thinking about looking at maps and asking for directions everywhere / getting multiple tuk tuks or taxis. Transport wise, if you're only visiting Angkor Wat / Angkor Thom and you're staying in Siem Reap then you might get away with a tuk tuk as they're about 15 minutes out of town, but if you're planning on travelling any further then get the A/C car. Despite the romance of a tuk tuk, the heat, dust, humidity and pollution sitting in the back of one for longer distances will ruin the adventure. All in all couldn't recommend this tour company enough and will use them again if (when!) we return to this beautiful country."

My friends and I decided to do a full Angkor Wat day from watching sunrise to doing to temple circuit with a bonus temple a bit further our thrown in. Our tour guide was fantastic and the nicest man you could ask for. He answered our questions, indulged the fact that we wanted to explore, and helped us make sense of things that at times looked literally like piles of rubble. The only issue I had was the some things were rushed through. I get that it is many tourists who are uninformed but we wanted to see the smaller and more interesting things and our guide almost totally glossed over a big section. Also they use restaurants they get commission from and they are pricey and take awhile to get food. It cuts into the day.Good news is the van was comfortable and cool and the water and cool wipes were a nice touch. Would use again but would be much clearer on our expectations."

Sear let me and wife experienced great Khmer hospitality and we learnt a lot from him - history, religion and the everyday in Cambodia that he would share with us in great detail. In the temples, whenever he sees trash or bottles left around by tourists, he would pick them up and clear them away. We should all learn to love and cherish these monuments. They are important to the Cambodian people so I hope people learn not to litter and help to preserve them. Another thing that impressed us was how Sear planned our itenary to avoid the crowds, and showed us where to compose a good photo. He shoots better pictures than me.

They even sent us a friendly email confirming our booking the day before. Make sure to make reservations months/weeks in advance esp during peak season. Excellent, highly recommended!"

Our guide, Mr. Sear, was very knowledgeable. Our driver was equally professional and anticipated our need for cold water & cool washcloths at different points during our tour. They knew how best to navigate the sites to avoid the crowds even offering an earlier start in the morning. This also allowed us to take much needed rest and cooling down at lunch.They accommodated the changes we made to the tour without pause.I would highly recommend this service."

Our guide Mr Chet and driver Mr Panha were an excellent team and we are very grateful for our 2 Day Tour of Angkor Wat and surrounding areas of Siem Reap. Mr Chet was most informative and answered our numerous and varied questions about the Angkor, the temples, religion, present-day Cambodian life and the history of Cambodia. It was the most insightful tour I have personally been fortunate enough to enjoy in 11months of traveling. My husband and Mother in-law thoroughly enjoyed the 2 Day Tour organised for us by Sam as well. We were traveling at one of the busiest times of the year (Chinese New Year), yet our guide managed to take us to places off the beaten track and away from the crowds. We managed to get some wonderful photos, as he knew just the right places to take them.Pick up was always timely and the pace of the tour moved at our own speed. We were very comfortable in our air conditioned car with complimentary water and the driver was very safe. I highly recommend this service to others and cannot praise Mr Chet enough. A truly excellent experience, deserving of more than 5 stars if that were possible."

Miraculously, we were on the road with an experienced guide and driver a few hours after the initial email inquiry to Samuel Lim, owner of the company.Our excellent guide, Mr. Sam, (not to be confused with Samuel Lim, the owner) spoke fluent English. Mr. Sam provided background information on each temple, and he shared stories of the meaning of the distinct artwork, as well as vignettes about Khmer culture (ancient and present-day). Sam's knowledge, experience, and patience made it a fun and unforgettable (though hot!) two days. He also led us to the best photo locations.The air conditioned car and Mr. Heng's unflappable driving were blessings as we travelled to temples in outlying areas.This two-day tour was a high point of our trip.Suzan R"

He changed the itinerary to fit what we wanted to do and persisted in getting us to Lake Tonle Sap and the stilt village, which I am really glad he did. It was a great experience.He was punctual, willing and accommodating (waited 10 mins while we finished watching the Superbowl final). His knowledge was first class, and he was happy to discuss cultural questions regarding the buddhist and hindu co-existance, along-side all the usual questions about the carvings and the architecture.Most importantly, it was a pleasure to be in his company over the three days, an important attribute for a guide.You don't need me to tell you, just look at the ratings given here. Have you ever seen such great numbers.Thoroughly recommended."

He was extremely knowledgeable about all the temples we visited, and the most amazing part was the sunrise over the Angkor Wat temple. It was mystical to see the sun slowly creep above the temple. In the tour we also visited a Cambodian village and saw palm sugar being made and we took a boat ride out to a floating village to see a totally different lifestyle than normal. The tour was great and so was the Guide and driver Borey."

He provided excellent and detailed information about the temples, their history and meanings, and enhanced our experience there so much more than if we had just explored by ourselves. He also made the tour more meaningful by also explaining Angkor in the context of modern Cambodian and Southeast Asian history; we both feel like we learned so much from him! Most importantly, we really appreciated Hour as a person. He was so kind and funny, and really took the chance to get to know us personally in addition to guiding. We felt as if we were good friends by the end of our time together, and I would certainly request to see him again or recommend other friends of mine to him in future trips to Cambodia. "

Picking a tour guide is pretty tough and after coming to Seim Reap it is obvious there are ALOT of choices and ALOT of competition for people's business as well. As we only had one day we wanted to pack in as much as we could and Sam helped set up an itinerary that suited our needs and my family. When we arrived at the lobby at 5:00am Mr Tay was waiting with a smile on his face that never left the whole day. He lead us to the perfect spot to watch the sunrise over Angkor Wat, lead us on a VERY informative tour of all the stops we went on and genuinely answered every question we had. I was very impressed. Mr Tay seemed to take pride in his work and he was definitely flexible with how the tour went. We have been on other tours where it is obvious there is a routine and you don't break the routine. Mr Tay gave us options depending on our interest through out the tour which we really appreciated. The van was always there when we were done with each temple and the driver was right there offering us water all day. I would highly recommend this outfit to anyone, email exchanges were great and prices were very competitive and the quality of the guide was top notch!Couple tips for people:Bring a flashlight or two if you plan on doing the sunrise. It is pitch black and you are walking across uneven blocks.Drink lots of water as it is usually very hot. There were good bathrooms at all the major temples that were clean and accessible,Bring small bills before you get to Seim Reap as they are used up quickly. $10's, $5's and $1's are great."

We emailed siem reap guide services & they were very efficient in organising this for us & replied promptly to make arrangements. We opted for the sunrise tour (5am pick up) for an extra $5. Our tour guide Mr Lynet was in the hotel reception waiting for us as arranged at 5am. We arrived at the site in complete darkness and waited for the sun to come up... It was gradual and took some time for the sun to completely come up but it was worth the wait as we got some brilliant photos. Our guide also offered to take photos for us & we got some great ones as he knew where the best places to stand to get the best views. Unless you are extremely well read on the subject I think you definitely need a tour guide to appreciate & know what you are looking at. Our tour guide was very polite & knowledgable about the history of Angkor Wat/Thom & Ta Prohm & gave us information about the carvings/inscriptions & gave us lots of contextual information about Cambodian culture & religion. This made the trip as we had little knowledge of this & we could fully appreciate the temple. I think we would have missed lots of things otherwise. Air conditioned car was a relief after walking around in the heat & we were provided with cold water too. Would recommend."

On the tour I feel that Mr. Chet went above and beyond what I would have expected from a tour guide. He really has a wealth of knowledge about all of the temples in the area that he is happy to share an engaging way. He also loves to take pictures and will make sure you come away with some memorable photos torrent. Our driver mr. Heng was always waiting in a strategic spot to pick us up and take us to the next place. All of the places visited were very different from eachother and all very impressive in different ways. As I said before in my opinion it's worth paying extra to go check out Beng Mealea. It was a major highlight for me. It has not been restored and i really enjoyed scrambling around on the ruins and seeing it in a less manicured condition. There are also less people around. Tldr: Mr. Chet is great.

The night before we decided to visit the Angkor complex, we were torn between self-guiding via tuk tuk and hiring a private guide service. It was getting late so we frantically searched for a service that may still be available on short notice. TripAdvisor to the rescue! We quickly emailed to see what was possible, and Mr. Sam got back to us within 5 minutes confirming that they'll see us at 9AM at our stay (Villa B). We decided on a full day guided tour in an air conditioned sedan, since we know the heat tends to affect enthusiasm for the subject matter later in the day. Highly recommend this little comfort, as it also made conversation easier in between locations.Speaking of conversation, we could tell we were in for a great day when we met our guide Mr. Rany. He introduced us to our driver Mr. Sat, and told us a bit of the driver's backstory (a proud father of three) including his role in the country's previous conflicts. Mr. Sat was always warm and smiling despite our language barrier, but his English was better than our Khmer. Mr. Rany is also a proud father, and had a deep passion for telling his people's story. His encyclopedic knowledge of every site we visited helped transport us back a thousand years, instead of just walking around some ruins. He's been giving tours for 10 years, and you can tell he's studied these places, and the royal families that commissioned them, extensively.We particularly enjoyed Angkor Thom and Bayon for its stone murals depicting daily life and the Khmer's fight with the Cham (Vietnam). We smiled along with Bayon's 200+ smiling faces, still cheerful despite the destruction of Buddhist imagery below them at the hands of subsequent occupants.Ta Prohm was also special for us. Mr. Rany knew places that gave us distance from the mass of other tourists clamoring for pictures, mostly with the famous trees that live on the stone structure. He also taught much about the nature that surrounds the temples. He noticed our interest in local wildlife and some of the cool spiders/insects, so he took us on a 20 minute walking path through the jungle to show us more colorful spiders and to listen to the cicadas.In all we visited: Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom's south gate, Angkor Thom's center (including Bayon), Ta Prohm (Tomb Raider), and Pre Rup. Each had its own mystique, and we covered a lot of ground for one day.One thing to watch out for is the heat and sun, which can be overpowering even with the comfort of AC in between. There are also a lot of tourists at each location which can make getting the right shot difficult. If you're not a fan of crowds, head out early to see if you can beat the rush.Water was provided in our package, and we were never without. Apply and bring extra sunscreen/insect repellent, a sun-hat and dress light. We did the entire tour in sandals despite uneven terrain and dirt paths, everything turned out fine.We had a great day with Mr. Rany and Mr. Sat, and this was one of those times we felt a little sad parting with our hosts. Thanks to them for making this a memorable experience!"

The schedule was perfect. The guide was very knowledgeable and spoke English well. Our driver (mr. seiha) was great and always in the ready to take us to our next destination. Overall, this was a memorable trip and I'm happy I went with Siemreapguideservices.com (Angkor Tour Guide). Well done!!!"

            "review": "Wonderful Four Day Tour. My wife, 13-year old daughter, and I had a wonderful four day tour with guide Sam Pho, visiting the Khmer ruins of Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, Banteay Srei, Ta Prohm, and several others. There are many temples and other structures in this area and Sam picked an excellent sampling from the best, picking times and approaches that would avoid crowds.One certainly could guide themselves through these temples, but they would be missing out on the whole history of the temples, why they were built, what has happened to them over the years, what the incredible amount of intricate carvings mean, etc. Sam knows all this and is clearly an expert, providing narrations on all of this including the incredibly rich Hindu (and later Buddhist) stories told through the walls and structures of these buildings. What I learned through Sam at these temples helped me understand the art in Thai temples I visited later on my trip.Besides the temples, Sam also took us to Phnom Kulen National Park and to Tonl\u00e9 Sap to see the stilt and lake villages there. Both of these trips were pleasant surprises and allowed us to see a glimpse of how most Cambodians live - these trips were what stick in my mind the most. As we drove through the countryside we would ask Sam \"What is that?\" and he always knew the answer. When we asked about people harvesting rice near the side of the road he stopped the car, had us hop out onto the farm, and showed us the rice being set out to dry. This is definitely a personalized tour.Lastly, Sam was an excellent guide to Cambodian life, culture, and politics, and just chatting with him about all this on the road between our various destinations made for a great experience. Thanks Sam!"

I was travelling with a friend and had arranged a one day tour through Sam, who was very helpful, efficient and communicated well. He assigned us with Mr Heng, as our driver. I had a very ambitious long day planned.Mr Heng picked us up on time at 7.30am. We visited the Butterfly centre, Landmine museum, Bantey Srei, Khbal Spean and Beng Mealea. At all times Mr Heng drove extremely carefully, was mindful of keeping us to our schedule as much as possible with flexibility when we requested it, very knowlegable - he willingly shared local information with us and it was very evident he was keen to help us enjoy our time in his country as much as possible. Mr Heng is a very courteous humble man. He never intruded and he took his role very seriously whilst you were in his care. He found us a really nice place to eat lunch. We were provided with bottles of chilled water, wet towels and a clean air conditioned car. Our day was long at our request, as we wanted to see and embrace so much but we never felt rushed and had more than adequate time to explore each stop with lots of walks included, though looking back I am sure we did put Mr Heng under a bit of pressure to get us through our schedule, but this was our fault as we got distracted with so much to take in.During my visit in Cambodia I suffered really badly from the heat with a very bad heatrash travelling all along my legs. it was incredibly uncomfortable and Mr Heng noticed my discomfort. On our return leg he kindly offered to take me to a chemist and communicated to the pharmacist on my behalf. I left with an antibiotic cream which provided great relief within the next day. My heaftfelt thank you to Mr Heng.I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Mr Heng or Sam's private tours. Initially it may seem a bit expensive but it gave us an amazing opportunity to see so much that we would never have experienced without a private driver and it was so worth it. Because we did a substantial loop and covered quite a distance a similar tour via a tuktuk would have been very uncomfortable and I don't believe it would be possible to get back prior to dark."

Having a guide like this makes the visit so much more enjoyable - especially if you have limited time. Day 1 he collected us at the hotel at 5 AM for the sunrise at Angkor Wat, then on to Angkor Thom and then Ta Prohm. Day 2 we squeezed in three visits: the floating village at Tonle Sap Lake (seeing how folks live there was an eye-opener), a silk farm just outside town and a sculpture center in town. Day 3 we went to the museum in Siem Reap, the market and generally walked around town soaking up the atmosphere.Clearly Tuon's background as a sculptor and then as a tour guide gave us a different take on all of the above. With excellent English, he had wonderful insight on the history and significance for each location and the challenges in restoring what had been looted over the centuries. So many Buddha statues with their heads cut off to sell to foreign buyers, these are being painstakingly replaced by local efforts.We appreciated the air-conditioned car that was always on standby, the cool drinks - especially during the heat of the day - and he was the most friendly, courteous, flexible and informed guide we've ever had. Highly recommended."

He offered me a schedule which I found very good. Because I had enough time, - I took the 7 Day ticket-, and I also wanted to see some of the local village life in the area. Soon I realised the immensity of the Area of the historic park of Angkor and I was really happy to have such a competent driver who knew how to organise the visits of the places I wanted to see. We had our Tea-breaks at local stalls and he showed me villages where they do Ikat weaving and we also stopped by at some stone carver.Since I also wanted to see the east of Cambodia, like the Mekong River and Ratanakiri, I was very happy to take him as my guide. As Sokra is also Member of the 'Cambodian pride tours' his Connections and Contacts where very helpful and made this part of my Journey an unforgettable experience.After I ended my visit to Angkor we went to the North to Prea Vihar and then to to the Laotian Border and down along the Mekong until Kampong Cham where we parted.Because there is so much more to see in Cambodia besides Angkor, to me Sokra and his Team from Cambodian pride tours will always be my travel companions on my future trips in Cambodia."

In fact, I imagine I got more out of the tour than other tourists with more time.Sam created an agenda for me that hit the well-known sights, but also cherry-picked some lesser-known spots that I may have missed. I love to take pictures, and he was helpful in making suggestions when it came to good locations for shots. He had deep knowledge of the history of the sights and the area, and selected convenient - and good - restaurants for meals.And, perhaps most importantly, Sam was very gracious. Even though the itinerary was ambitious, I never felt rushed, even when I wanted to take \"just one more picture\" or return to a spot when the area was free of tour groups. Plus, until my visit, I had no idea of the importance of the cold towels that Sam kept in stock! His command of the English language is excellent.Finally, a little bit of advice: No matter how tired you are, wake up early in the morning to watch the sun rise over Angkor Wat!

She told us so much history of the temples and Siem Reap, we would never have known all these if we had been by ourselves. She knew how to interest the kids too, so it was a great experience for the 4 of us. Her and Mr Sat ( driver ) took us to a nice place for lunch and we enjoyed the local food. One of our favourite trip in Asia. Thank you Mrs Saven and Mr Sat !"

Especially as at the time of the tours I was 7 months pregnant. He adjusted the tour and recommended spots for me to rest that had a great view while I had water and rested. Please do request him and Mr. Khom the driver. We never waited more than two minutes for the car to show up, which is amazing considering the amount of traffic of cars and people around the temples. We will definitely be using Angkor Tour Guide the next time we are in Siem Reap for the temples. Absolutely a great value for the level of service you receive."

Saven was at my hotel early each day with plenty of energy and enthusiasm, even at 5:00 in the morning! As a woman traveling in Cambodia alone, I felt relieved that my guide was also a woman and, needless to say, I felt very safe and comfortable with her. I agree with the other reviewers, having a tour guide for the temples really is necessary. Saven was able to point out places in each temple that I would have missed on my own (like the only apsara dancer who shows her teeth when she smiles), provide context for each temple, and make sure I got great pictures of both the temples and myself (which wasn't an easy job in sweltering heat). Having Saven as my guide enriched my experience of Angkor Wat, and I am grateful to have had her as my guide!"

The benefit of having a guide is of course his explanations. He will also know the routes into the temples which groups don't use, the less well known parts of the temples and the times where temples are less busy. Down sides are the overdose of explanations. Beyond that, my guide managed to take good pics of me (a challenge), provided fresh water throughout the day which is indispensable and picked decent restaurants for lunch. I haven't rated excellent because I don't think that the service exceptionally stood out ie I got what a lot of other companies would have delivered.

I was forthright that I didn\u2019t want to see every single statue and hear the history on every single thing. Instead, I wanted someone to take me to the key sights, giving me the key info and helping me see the best parts of each place. Sam did that exact thing for me. Mr Lynet was my guide who spoke good English but with a very heavy accent so was difficult to understand sometimes but his passion and knowledge more tha made up for it. If there was a time I could not understand, I just asked him to repeat. And Mr Kim was my driver and he too did an excellent job and communicated well in English. I had a terrific day.Started very early to see sunrise at Angkor Wat which you have to see, stopping about half way to Angkor Wat to buy the obligatory park entrance fee in cash. Then after sunrise, spent about 1.5 hours exploring Angkor Wat and the early timing was good to miss many of the tour buses and the heat. Then after grabbing some breakfast, we went to Angkor Thom the ancient city including Bayon the Buddha faces temple. From there to Baphuon, elephant & leper king terraces. Then to Ta Prohm the tomb raider temple covered with trees and jungle which was certainly interesting. Then off to Bantey Srei the lady temple with great carvings made from pink sandstone. I then went back to hotel as it was only about 1330 and was picked up later in the day to view sunset from atop Phnom Bakheng ( Bakheng Hill). A great day and exactly what I wanted. Some folks want more, and some want less, just tell Sam your style & preferences and he will meet your specific needs and requests, making it the best possible experience!"

Thanks to glowing Trip Advisor reviews, we chose Private Siem Reap Tour Guide - Private Day Tours to guide us around the temples near Siem Reap. We were delighted with the result! Our first contact, Sam proved a great start as he responded to my emails promptly and with patience while we negotiated our requirements. Every aspect of our 3-day guiding went smoothly. Our tour guide, the \"handsome\" Mr Pheara and our studious driver Mr Heng attended to our every need. Prompt attention, smooth ticket purchase, car-door opening(!) extensive information about the temples and local customs, dining advice, toilet stops, bottled water, cool hand towels... all contributed to a steady, seamless overall experience. Absolutely delighted we chose 3 days, as this allowed us time to reflect and compare upon what we had seen, to better appreciate the scale of this region's historical magnificence (with so much more still to see...). We particularly enjoyed the drive to & from Beng Mealea because we saw farmlands and local living conditions as well. Depending upon how much you wish to get out of your trip, we can recommend having some historical background prior to your visit. On the afternoon we arrived we briefly visited the Angkor National Museum for a quick walk-through to absorb at least some information about the Hindu and Buddhist gods, kings and legends. I had read John Shors hostorical fiction, \"Temple of a Thousand faces\" which helped set the scene. Given you will see various temples from different Angkorian periods, you might also find it helpful to have some visual reference of what was built and when (we bought the Angkor Explorer map which has a little list on it). Otherwise some of the king's names are quite difficult to remember and distinguish. We found the overall experience affected us on a spiritual level. It struck us how kind and gentle, welcoming and grateful all the Khmer people were. We feel very privileged to have visited this extraordinary region and hope to visit it again someday. Thank you!"

But there were so many beautiful temples: The Bayon temple, the \"Indiana Jones\" temple, Ta Prohm or \"Tomb rider\" temple among others. There are so many places to visit and you will be amazed at every sight. The size, the carvings, the impressive remains of the powerful Khmer Empire. We learned so much about the history, the religion and also the current affairs through our guide.Our guide was Sam Art and the van driver Mr. Saroeun. They picked us up from the airport and also dropped us off. Sam was very funny from the beginning and made us feel very welcomed. Our flight was delayed, but he rescheduled everything for us, so we didn't miss anything. On the last day, I forgot my ring in the van when we left for the airport, but Mr Saroeun checked everything and returned the ring to us. I will be eternally grateful. The weather was really hot, but they provided us with ice cold water and cold disposable towels any time we finished sightseeing. The van was very comfortable and air-conditioned, so we had a chance to cool down going from temple to temple. For each attraction, Sam will tell us the history and he was very entertaining. We also rode elephants circling the Bayon temple, which was my favorite temple. We also happy that there were not so many tourists at this time of the year, so we could appreciate the sights and take pictures without much interruption. Sam will find the right photo spot and different poses to make the photo more interesting. And we didn't mind asking for pictures because he really seemed to enjoy being the photographer.

Our tour guide, Pheara Sopheara, was professional, informative and accommodating. Our driver was great as well. From our first email contact with Sam to the end of our tour we had an amazing experience."

            "review": "A truly wonderful experience!. My husband, 9 year old daughter and I had recently been to Cambodia. It was a wedding anniversary gift from my husband and it was our first time visiting this country. We booked a vehicle with a driver and guide from Sam for the entire duration of our stay there including pick up from and drop to the airport. The driver Mr. Heng as well as our guide Bun were extremely good. They were very fluent in English and very courteous. Mr. Heng is a skilled driver and kept us supplied with cold water to drink as well as cold wet towels as we were there at the height of summer. Bun was very knowledgeable about the history of the country and had some great suggestions on which places/temples to focus on. He gave us an accurate picture of the ease or difficulty of getting to each place given that we had a young child with us. Bun was a very jovial and fun loving guide, giving us insight into the Cambodian way of life and answering our hundreds of questions with great patience. He would joke and laugh with other tour groups at the places we visited and we ended up making friends thanks to him. He also doubled up as our photographer and sportingly accepted having to take multiple snaps of us in 2 phones and one DSLR slung around his neck at every picturesque point (and there were many!). We can't thank them both enough and would definitely recommend this tour company to any of our friends who visit Cambodia."

So, we choose this private tour to bring us. The car is nice, and the driver make sure we always convinient. He never let the car get hot inside. The driver knows english and he drives us to all the main temples in Angkor Wat complex around Siem Reap.Overall, this is a very recommended tour."

Her English is excellent and she moved us pretty quickly from spot to spot. We opted for the sunrise tour (as opposed to the sunset one), but that means you get out the door by 5 am, which makes for a very long day. Be aware of the heat; it is brutal in Cambodia. Also, note that the ticket lines are very long, so if you time it too close, you'll miss the sunrise. Saven made sure I was wearing the proper clothes - another must because if your arms and knees are not covered, there are certain things you are not allowed to see. All in all, a magical day."

We had a great 1 day tour with our tour guide Saven, she was very knowledgeable about the history and significance of all the temples and was very flexible in allowing us to go at our own pace and even accommodated our request to have a break between sightseeing in order to charge our camera.After seeing the major temples. I would recommend booking a 2 day tour to see the highlights. It is doable in 1 day, however it gets so unbearably hot and humid during the day, you're forced to take a break between 11:30-2:30. Also having an air con car to go between the temples really helps.I enjoyed Angkor Wat, Bayon (inside Angkor Thom) and Prom Penh the most. I would highly recommend visiting Bayon in the off hours either at 5:30 am or at 4pm to avoid the droves of tourists. Because this is a very small temple, you will not be able to see anything if you go during the busiest hours.Also I was very much underwhelmed with the sunrise at Angkor Wat, it's not much of a view. Our tour guide told us that the best time to view the sunrise is in September when the sun is directly above the temples.During the tour, you are taken to a local restaurant for lunch, which was OK, but clearly a tourist trap with different menus for tourists and locals. After the tour you are offered to go to a local tourist shop to purchase silk or silver products. Overall very good service, prompt, polite, on time and highly recommended."

He went at our pace and having a guide meant we saw and understood so much more than we otherwise would have. Sam took us to the Eastern entrance to Angkor Wat to start our tour whereas the majority of tourists start at the Western entrance which was great. We booked with this tour company based on reviews and were very glad we did. Thanks Sam for a fantastic day."

We also saw the Temple of the King Crematorium. Great view from the top. Carry some spare clothes to take a dip in the waterfall on top of the hill. Really enjoyed after a long walk in the heat uphill.Day 2 - Woke up at 4 and Mr.Chet was there to pick us up from our hotel at 5 am to view the sunrise at Angkor Watt. This was the highlight of our trip. If you want great shots of Angkor watt be there at 5. pack your breakfast from hotel and you could have it in one of the restaurant next to the lotus pond inside temple complex. We then went on to see Angkor Thom , Central of Angkor Thom ( Bayon, Baphoun, Celestial Temple of Phimeanakas, Elephant and Leper King Terraces ). The tour ended with afternoon visit to Ta Prohm the tomb raider temple covered by jungles and giant trees.Please take umbrella, sun screen and if possible a mini USB fan, Could be very handy. Do take some Prickly heat powder, could cool down the body a bit.Me and my wife highly recommend to buy Siem Reap tour services from Angkor Guide Sam Day Tour agency. Mr.Chet was very helpful to even go beyond his duties to help us to book a Helicopter ride for aerial view of Angkor. he has great Geographical, Historical and Mythological knowledge which he shared with passion. And give him the camera and he will give you back some great photos of your family.http://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g297390-d6522493-r282270968-Angkor_Guide_Sam_Day_Tour-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html#"

Planned the day before we arrived in Siem Reap, Sam responded to us quickly and with very good advice for planning our itinerary (fabulous for last minute travelers like me). Our guide and driver, Mr. Bun Chuop and Mr. Heng, were very accommodating. Note that the price of the tour is the same for a similar group size - we planned for 2 people but we met a backpacker the day before our tour and invited her along on the tour - no problem and no extra charge!!! We went to the Angkor National Museum the day before so we would have some background info of the tour which was very helpful. Mr. Bun Chuop knew the best places to go, the best photo ops and the best times to visit each of the temples. We went to Angkor Wat for the sunrise, followed by Bayon, Bantey Srei, Ta Prohm. We even went back to Angkor Wat in the afternoon for another photo op. Mr. Bun Chuop and Mr. Heng were very flexible, too. One of our party got sick and they were able to swing by our hotel to drop her off after we finished Angkor Wat. Mr. Bun Chuop also gave us a lot of information about Cambodian history and day-to-day life in Siem Reap (we were very interested in this information as it was our first trip to Cambodia). We had a wonderful time!!Recommendation: Visit the Angkor Wat National Museum before the tour to get a good introduction to the history/religions/culture. Would also advise to visit the Wats again on your own time (you can hire a tuktuk for the day cheap). Wish I was there longer to get a 3-day pass would be perfect but we only had the one day to visit the temples. This tour was fabulous to condense everything into just one day!!!"

Mr San ( in Cambodian & Chinese the surname comes first), proved to be very good value in cost for his services as driver & guide. He was also very flexible & easy in accommodating to our needs in terms of sights we wished to see & / or time we wished to spend walking the numerous temple sites which can be hot & very humid in forested areas.A big plus for Mr San is that he will enable 3 non consecutive days of temple tour around the Ankor area, whereas most other guides will only take 3 consecutive days which limits your choice in time to experience other aspects of Siem Reap & other places of interest. We had a wonderful time being guided by Mr San who had good knowledge of all the temples & places we visited. He is good at dodging the crowds & advising on the best places to get good photo shots from. This includes his advice on dawn & sunset photo shots. He is also knowledge in bringing you to lunchtime places to eat which are reasonable in price & give good & tasteful dishes. We had a fantastic & enjoyable time in Seam Reap thanks to Mr San who is not only a good guide & safe driver. He has a good sense of humour which comes out during his guide of the temples. But you have to be there to experience that!!So go & meet Mr San & enjoy Ankor in the comfort of air conditioned car, free bottled water & wonderful company. Thank you Mr San, we wish you & your family good health, happiness & prosperity.Paul & Lanna Sui LengSurrey, U.K."

Sovandy was also quite flexible on making changes to our plans or adjusting the pace of our tours based on our needs. At the Angkor Wat, his advice on getting the best camera angles was much appreciated.We had a great time, and I have no hesitation in recommending this particular guide service.A note for those with travelling with elderly or very young children: The temples are not stroller friendly and because a lot of it is in ruins it's not exactly even ground.

Our guide Ms Saven was brilliant and so knowledgable and a laugh to say. We enjoyed her company and knowledge of all the temples we visited. Amazed to say we compared it with other tourist to the near lake village and they didn't get the experience we did with a knowledgable guide. Honestly I wasn't templed out like most especially reflecting back to my days 15 years ago. Best time and I learnt a hell of a lot out of of our guide Ms Saven. Our youngest daughter in year 8 has been studying this area for school and no doubt Benefit a lot. The history of buddism and Hinduism over the periods was a learning experience. Amazing and will be back again in September with the same mates 15 years ago, but that time with a guide like Ms Saven. The extra details in areas other tour guides in the sculptures at sites that ms Saven knew was a blessing. Thanks Sam but especially our guide Ms Saven. You have to try the Amok Chicken ah....

It's so hot there!!!! We had him and our great driver for 2 days. His knowledge was invaluable and made our temple and fishing village trip so much more interesting. I have never booked a tour guide in my life but first time I was well impressed! Just do it... As it will be great. No worries."

Mr Rany was a very knowledgeable, informative and professional guide. He provided a good balance between overloading us with information and giving us time to explore and see things for ourselves. Of course, we did the major attractions of Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom but he also took us to other Temples where we were the only people there, allowing us to wander and enjoy the area. The highlight of day 2 was the floating village (or the not so floating village in the dry season). This was truly an amazing visit and a must for anyone traveling to Siem Reap. I am sure that different companies go to different locations but the area we went to was a fascinating insight into the life and culture of these people who live off the lake. It was good to go to an area that wasn't full of large tourist buses. Mr Rany was always keen to help and provide additional knowledge. He even stopped a couple of times on the side of the road to buy us some 'sticky rice bbqed in cane' and some 'crickets' and 'water roaches' which only the guys would eat. Overall, it was a wonderful trip and I would highly recommend using this company and both Mr Rany and Mr Ron."

Then after our tour Vespa staff and Akim took the time to find us another Hotel too stay at, having told them the current Hotel we had book was substandard and not a place to spend the rest of our stay in Siem Reap.

My family spent 4 wonderful days in Siem Reap, and Soviet Ty (Viet) is such a helpful, humours, smart and caring guide and also a great photographer who has made our trip a truly memorable experience. I would strongly recommend him and his company, Angkor Vision Tour to anyone who is interested in visiting Siem Reap (and other parts of Cambodia). We visited Bayon temple, Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, Ta Prohm, Tonle Sap Lake etc. The temples are magnificent, the view is breathtaking. And above all, Viet is very good at picking the best time of the day to visit the attractions (so as to avoid the crowd), and choosing the best spot for photo taking. He is also very flexible and caring, and is happy to adjust the travel plan to accommodate our needs. He even invited us to attend a Cambodian wedding with him (which happened to take place during our visit). We enjoyed very much - a great way to learn about Khmer culture. His car is air-conditioned so we don't have to worry about the hot weather. The restaurants he took us to were also great. Viet has made a lot of recommendations to us and we do trust him. He speaks very good English and is very friendly. I am more than happy to introduce him, a terrific tour guide!"

Nang Nak, a great guide if you need one (nangnak_Angkor@yahoo.com) took us to the Big Buddha stopping on the way at a house to see something of every day life not connected to tourist sites. It's a reclining Buddha carved out of a mountain top and older than some of the temples. It is surrounded by the same sort of supplicants, vendors of relics and spiritual advisors that have been at this place for hundreds of years.Also visit Banteay Srei, Lady Temple, which has very pronounced relief carving and beautiful pink stone. There you can take a quiet boat trip through marsh (if there's water!) and really forget the tourists.I'd have to say that the museum shop has beautiful things, and the 1000 buddhas exhibit is a fabulous way to learn a little bit about what you are visiting. Try to find a place to taste Amok. Probably not on \"Pub Street.\""

He was very forthcoming about offering information and answering all our questions. He has a great personality- open and friendly. His flexibility was greatly appreciated. I had a bad cold and wasn't able to keep up with all the planned activities. He was great about modifying the program for us and helping us see as much as possible, yet giving me the chance to rest when I needed to. The driver that accompanied Sam was great also; safely navigating the somewhat precarious traffic in Siem Reap. Sam was always punctual, pleasant and helpful. He is a very hard worker and wants his guests to really enjoy the experience. He also conducts tours all over Cambodia and has led groups for several weeks through his country. We enjoyed him thoroughly and can recommend him without hesitation. We were somewhat surprised at how reasonable his prices were and were so pleased with his service that we gave him about 20% more than he quoted us. Sam Pho is truly a wonderful guide."

We arrived the night before and were picked up at our hotel at 5am for the sunrise tour of Angkor Wat. After touring Angkor Wat, we then went to Angkor Thom and to Ta Prohm (Tomb Raider temple). I absolutely recommend getting a private guide for your trip to the temples.Ms Saven was our personal guide and she was amazing. Very articulate, knowledgeable, and had a great sense of humor. We wanted to avoid crowds, so she took us early to Angkor Thom while a lot of other tour companies took visitors back to their hotels for lunch. She spent extra time to speak to us about Cambodian history, and was a great photographer (she took many group shots of us). She also took us to a great restaurant for lunch later in the day.Sam was the most responsive guide when we were searching for a private tour. I highly recommend this tour company.Recommendations for other travelers to Siem Reap temples: (1) If you like architecture and history, spend more than one day viewing temples. There are tons of temples in the area - not just Angkor Wat. We only did a one day tour - which was plenty for 1 day (5am to 3pm), but we did not have time to see other temples the next day. If your not big on seeing a variety of temples, then a 1 day tour should be perfect. I wished that we had a second day to see the (2) We did the 5am morning tour of Angkor Wat - which is a 5am hotel pickup, drive to get our national park passes, then snag a spot in front of a pond/moat in front of Angkor Wat. After sunrise, we then went into Angkor Wat for a tour. This was amazing - but be warned there are a lot of people also doing the same thing. If we were to do this again, we would still go early, but ask to find a different spot to watch the sunrise to avoid the crowds.(3) Note that while Ta Prohm (tomb raider temple) is amazing - and I'm not suggesting to skip it - there is a large amount of restoration occurring around the temple. A crane has been erected and a large amount of building work is underway to rebuild the temple. Wooden walkways now block some of the previously famous postcard photos."

My short visit of Siem Reap ( two day tour) with its beautiful temple and surrounding became even more unforgettable for me through the excellent guidance of Ms Saven. She showed me the special spots in the least busy time of the day. Her knowledge of the history is brilliant and she did her job with lot of motivation and humor. Mr Heng made me feel comfortable by his safe driving.I just have to recommend this team to make your trip become a great and unforgettable experience."

Thank you Sam for all your help, your prompt response to our email ( when we didn't want to pay the huge excesses the hotel charged) for the short notice tours and helping us find something to meet all our wants (2 adults and 11 and 7 year old boys). We can not thank you enough for linking us with Mr Sun (guide) and Ron- we had a blast full of education and crazy kid stuff with flexibility to rearrange, stop back at hotel etc when kids or us needing recharging.

He politely explained that he'd only have the following day available, so we decided to go with him for our first day on Angkor Wat.This was undoubtedly the best decision we could have made. Sam is extremly knowledgeable and can explain thoroughly the history behind the temples and its carvings. He pays a lot of attention to small details that would have gone unseen without his guidance, and this makes the exploration much more interesting. Our car was very comfortable and he always had cold water waiting for us between temples. He also took us to a local, family run restaurant that had one of the best amok I had while in Cambodia.It's a pity we didn't have him for the following days, so book in advance to guarantee his guidance and knowledge!Do not hesitate on contacting Sam Pho for your Angkor visit, you will not be disappointed."

Once we got there, he made sure we were comfortable throughout the trip (those cold towels and bottled waters were much appreciated!). He had an encyclopedic knowledge of the temples and other sites, not to mention he was a great photographer! My wife and I don't normally come away with lots of great couple photos on our trips, so having Sam take our photos (IPhone and DSLR) was great. I highly recommend a private tour guide for most trips; and Sam happens to be the best. Definitely lived up to the TripAdvisor hype!Thanks again, Sam! from Paul and Crissy"

I wrote him a email and two or three emails later we had a fair deal for a three day trip with Sam. Day 1: Pick up from our hotel at 5 am ( Park Hyatt Siem Reap). First we went to buy a day temple passes costs $ 20 per person wiht picture from myself - what an experience at 5 .10 am! Then we where going to visit sunrise at Angkor Wat. Sam knows always the best places where not all tourists are! And believe me - there are many tourists in the morning. After sunrise we started to visiting Angkor Wat till 8 am. After that we made a transfer back to our hotel with the SUV car from Sam. We had time for breakfast and rest at the swimming pool. We left the hotel around 11 am again and went to visit South Gate of Angkor Thom, Central of Angkor Thom (Bayon, Baphoun, Celestial Temple of Phimeanakas, Elephant and Leper King Terraces). It was amazing. Sam knows everything about history, history of art and a lot more. After that we had lunch at a local restaurant nearby. In the afternoon we visit Ta Prohm (the tomb raider temple covered by jungles and giant trees) - It was unforgettable! . Day 2 : We left the hotel @ 7:30 am. Our drive to Koh Ker was about 2 hours (120 km). The admission fee is 10 per person. Koh Ker was very interesting. A pyramid like in the Yucatan (Uxmal) - After that we had lunch in a good restaurant nearby. In the afternoon we visited Beng Mealea (admission fee is $ 5 per person ) the sprawling jungle temple surrounded by vegetation. We climbed like Indiana Jones on this temple located 70 km from Siem Reap city. Beng Mealea was a great experience and also one more highlight in Cambodia. Day 3 : We left the hotel at 9 am. Today we were going to visit the countryside of Cambodia. We saw the real way of people life and the floating and fishing villages of Kompong Khleang. We made a private Boat-Tour (admission fee costs $ 20 per person for adult from 2 pax - one hour and half) to experience the floating and fishing village on the great Tonle Sap lake. It was unbelievable to see how this people live next and with the water! If you have the chance to see this - don't miss it. Sam is a very safe driver, well educated and has a great knowledge about his country. Believe my, my wife studied history and archeology and knows a lot...! We can highly recommend Sam as a Tour Guide and Driver in Siem Reap."

Mr Rany took us through the temple to the other side away from the crowds and we only saw a few people the whole time.I would use this company again anytime ... hopefully I'll get to go back again someday!"

We walked out. Sam guided us through the temples and complex history of his country in an engaging way. Compared to other costs in Siem Reap such as hotels and restaurants, his fees seemed expensive, but on a par with guides available through our hotel. We felt it was worth the expense to have our own guide, van and driver to avoid the hustle and bustle and heat. Vans were clean and cold water and towels were always available.

The idea was obviously to avoid most of the crowds by going to places not visited by all tour agents and as well going on odd times and through odd entrances. In reality crowds were not really avoided but let's say managed in a good way. Apart from seeing all the \"must see ones\" I went to see some smaller temple areas in the outskirts of the \"beaten track\" which was really good. In the tour was also visits to the stilted villages along Ton Lesap lake, floating villages on the lake and a tuk-tuk tour on the countryside, visiting a small village with market and peoples living grounds. The tour had that little extra touch such as wet and cool towels and bottles of cold water when needed as most, an excellent breakfast out at one of the remote temples, a gin tonic on a small boat at sunset! A lot of temples and ruins but due to the great variety of the temple/ancient cities areas it was never felt to be repetitive. On the negative side was only the price!"

Both were also very accommodating and they agreed to exchange the sunset that was programmed at one of the temples for a visit to the Angkor National Museum which is also worth a visit, our guide Bun even explained the exhibition halls in the museum which helps to have a better understanding of the Khmer Empire and have a complete picture of the significance of the temples."

My wife and I hired Sam to guide us through Angkor Wat, Beng Mealea, Ta Prohm and Angkor Thom, we found Sam to be an excellent guide and companion and we thoroughly enjoyed his company. I booked with Sam a month in advance, he sent us a list of sites we could visit and we selected which ones we were most interested in, from there Sam built the itinerary. Sam is very knowledgeable in the history of each of the temples and his English is excellent, we learned a lot not just about the temples but about Cambodian culture and history. All along the way Sam provided us with fresh bottles of cold water and cold towels, a welcome relief in the Cambodian heat! I cannot recommend Sam enough, you will not be disappointed!"

This, on top of learning more about the culture and the side stories, even without the aid of any map or guidebook.My friends and I were extremely busy such that we were unable to book any guides or make and plans or itinerary before we had traveled. Thankfully, we found and were expediently accommodated and serviced via the quick e-mail interchange we had with Sam.With our tour guide (Mr. Sear) in the comfort of the air-conditioned SUV they had provided, we were able to explore the main and significant sights in and around the Angkor complex. Mr Sear was very knowledgeable and all our questions were adequately answered. Super helpful that Sear had a great command of the English language (and he is learning French and Spanish on the side, which really is a great thing) as he comfortable narrates stories and the history behind each of the different places we visited over the 2-days that we booked their services. We also really appreciate Sear going out of the way to bring us to places where our group could take spectacular photos from relatively uncrowded areas. He also graciously helped us get unique trick shots.Given that the atmosphere in Siem Reap is quite humid, the cold water and cold towels we would be offered every time we would return to the SUV would always be a welcome treat.I would definitely book them again if I were to explore more of Siem Reap and head to the other temples and sights around the area."

It would not be possible if not for a reliable english-speaking tour guide, Mr Bun Lem Nhem. He is very punctual. On that day, Bun Lem reached our hotel punctually around 5am as he wanted to bring us to enjoy the famous Siem Reap sunrise. When we first met him, we were amazed by his fluent English. Not only that, he is also well versed with everything about Siem Reap and very intellectual indeed. Because of his well-timed arrangement, we managed to visit those temples at Angkor Wat ahead of the crowds. For those temples that we have visited, we managed to understand the history and rationale behind those wonderfully crafted sculptures and paintings. And the history involving Buddhism and Hinduism was truly fascinating. Thankfully, Bun Lem has a good sense of humour too. No doubt those history was fascinating but there were still times where it got a little dry. That's when his jokes came in and you would then be well awake again. Before the tour ended, Bun Lem even recommended what were the must-try food at siem reap. To sum up, our trip to Siem Reap would not be that awesome without the professional tour guide in Bun Lem. Call Bun Lem if you wish to make the most of your trip in Siem Reap. Thank you Bun Lem from Richard and Soik Mui."

We are well travelled New Yorkers who have a high bar for expectations from travel guides. He showed us many great temples and took us for sunrise viewing of beautiful Angkor wat. He spoke English well. He knew the full histories of all the temples and most importantly he was skillful in helping us strategicallly avoid the huge crowds at ankor wat. One of the highlights was after the sunrise at ankor wat, he led us to a side temple gate where we were the only ones exploring the ruins. We came face to face with about 80 monkeys who were swinging from tree tops on to the temple ruins. Our group was outnumbered by the wild monkeys who were friendly and posed for photos with us. Had we stayed on the typical ankor wat trial, we would have missed this incredible side trip. Samath and our driver were efficient and always ready with cold water after sweaty hikes from temple to temple. Highly recommend Samath if you want to see the highlights of the area and avoid the typical tourist routine."

We were provided with cold water and cold wipes as the days were hot and we visited around 4 temples and a fishing village within the two days- he even found us a great family run Khmer restaurant near the temples for lunch which wasn't crowded with tourists and served traditional food for good prices. On our last day the price was still the same as he had mentioned before and there was no pressure for a tip or further service as some tour guides do.If you're ever in town contact Sam!

Sam kept in touch via email regularly and put together a tour package to suit us. This included a sunrise visit to Angkor Wat, then back to the hotel for breakfast, after one of the most comprehensive guided tours we have ever experienced. Mr Saruon introduced himself as our guide and Mr Hang our driver in the early hours. Mr Saruon had so much knowlegede about the area, not only the Angkor Wat but the whole Cambodian history. He was so polite, full of information and also very aware of our needs. He often checked with us if we needed water, food, a rest etc. After having breakfast back at our hotel, we were picked up again (in a lovely airconditioned car) and taken to visit some of the other attractions, Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm (Tomb Raider temple)! Once again Mr Saruon was a wealth of information about each of the places. He knew all of the places to look at and where to take the best photos! He took a heap of photos for us, which was fantastic to have us both in the photos for a change!! Mr Hang was a lovely man and a wonderful driver, in the chaotic and manic streets of Cambodia, believe me that is a godsend!!! I cannot rate these people more highly! It is essential to have a guide when going around the Wats, or you would just miss far too much! To have a guide who was as knowledgeable as Mr Saruon is an added bonus, and all for only $90!! Thank you to all of you, we have been on guided tours all over the world and I have to say this was one of the best! Good luck for the future!"

We flew from Manila to Ho Chi Min connecting to Siem Reap Cambodia. My husband and I are US citizens so we filed an e-visa on line and printed it. When we arrived at Siem Reap, the immigration officer who stamped our passports asked for a $ tip each. And mind you, they took our money over the counter! Since our flight was delayed, I was worried about our pick up. So happy to see Mr Heng outside the airport with our names. I made this arrangement on line with Mr. Sam Pho for pick up and 1 day tour for 2 guests for a total of $100.00. This price does not include our lunch and temple entrances which was $20/person. Mr Pho promptly emailed our itinerary for my review and approval. Our tour guide Mr. Bun Chuop picked us up from our hotel at 5:45 am to watch the sunrise at Angkor Wat. He accompanied us to the ticketing office for the temples pass. When we reached Angkor Wat, I was surprised with the crowd of people. We waited and waited, unfortunately, since it was hazy, the sun was covered with clouds. Then Mr Chuop took around for pictures and proceeded temple hopping. We were so impressed with the ancient temples as old as 9th century. These temple ruins still show intricate engineering and architecture. Although most of the Buddhas were no longer there due to loss wars, the history behind it was awesome. Mr. Chuop was very knowledgeable. He was so much fun, his personality was very pleasant. He even offered to take our pictures with my iPad. Mr. Heng offered cold towels and bottled water every time we finish each temple visit. Excellent service since it was very hot and humid.At the end of the trip, we were very satisfied with our day tour! We gave a generous tip to Mr. Chuop and Mr. Heng. Btw, restaurants and tuk tuks accept dollars, and they will give you change in dollars too. We had foot massages after our day tour. Cost was about $15 for 2 guests for 30 minutes each. It felt really good! Tuk tuk took us back to our hotel for $3 total (2 guests). Overall, I can say that I love Siem Reap. People here are nice and friendly. Lifestyle in Siem reap is very simple. Food is delicious and very reasonable. Hotels are mostly 4 to 5 Stars. I'd come back to visit again."

We entered to Angkor Wat temple from the behind entrance which I though it was smart so you can avoid the crowd that it is always at the main entrance and then you finish the Angkor Wat tour from the main entrance."

Mr Sear was incredibly knowledgable and we would particularly recommend him if you are interested in history and culture. We were able to construct our own tour but in the end followed his lead as he knew exactly whee to go and the best things to see. We made all the arrangements by email and they accommodated our unexpected change in plans when our flight into Siem Reap was delayed 2 hours. Overall a fantastic experience and we would highly recommend this tour company.."

He was very detailed so we knew exactly what to expect and which temples we were going to see. Our tour guide, Siphera, was right on time and was extremely friendly. We had a good time talking to him about Cambodia on the way to the first temple, and he was happy to answer all of our questions. He also enjoyed telling us about his personal life and what it was like growing up in the area.Siphera was a terrific tour guide inside the temples and was extremely knowledgable. He always asked us he we wanted to hear the history of the specific area or if we wanted to quietly enjoy the beauty. Allowing us to choose the pace and depth of the tour was greatly appreciated. I highly recommend Sam's tour company and Siphera as a guide."

Thankfully Sam was able to fit me in and provided me with Mr Rany as the guide and driver. He was fantastic! Not only is he a great photographer (I travelled solo so needed someone to help take photos for me) but he was also passionate about explaining all the places we went to and giving me the context. I learnt so much from him about the Khmer empire and it made going to the sites so much more rewarding. I did a 3 day tour using an itinerary penned by Sam who also allowed me to make changes depending on where I wanted to go. We covered the different temples in the Angkor region as well as Tonle Sap. Was a great trip and tour! Thank you so much Mr Rany! Do remember that access fees to temples etc are outside the tour/guide cost which is what you would expect."

After weeks of searching for a private tour around Siem reap, we decided to book Mr. Sam Pho's tour because of all the positive comments that we've read in tripadvisor. True enough, he is a really really really great tour guide. He responds patiently to never ending inquiries thru email, accommodates all requests and even gives discount! He is a real knowledgabe tour guide and knows the ins and outs of every temple there is in Siem Reap. Also, he gives us cold towels and cold water after a tour around the temples under the scorching heat of the sun. I highly recommend Sam Pho's tour!He is the best tour guide in Siem Reap!"

It was very easy to explain by mail what we wanted to do and Mr. Sam Pho did is best to fulfill all our wishes. The price is also very good. I have searched in many sites and it was the best price. We made a tour of 3 Days and it was great. We visited the Angkor Wat complex, visited other temples more distant, ride an elephant and had a monk blessing... It was suberb!! We had Mr. Sear as our guide and Mr. Heng as driver. I think it's good to have Both so you can enter in a Gate in the complex and go to the opposite Gate and Mr. Heng will be there to pick us with a smile and a cold Water. Mr. Sear was a wonderful guide. He knows So much of the history and we learned a lot with him. It was impossible to understand so much only with a book. He was very Nice, speaks a very good english and did all to make us happy. I highly recomend their services. Wish you all the best and success to your company because you deserve it!Greetings from PortugalBela Prata and Friends"

I contacted Sam & he responded immediately to my email with a great one day itinerary which would take me around the main temples of Angkor. We exchanged a few more emails to set up the tour (I requested for a female guide since I felt more comfortable with that) & it was very easy to communicate with him. Miss Kahna & Mr Heng arrived right on time at my hotel the day of the tour. Miss Kahna was very kind, informative & flexible with how the tour went. She was also a great photographer and never got tired of me asking her to take my photo. I usually like to do things on my own but having a guide & a driver made my trip a lot less stressful. Would definitely recommend to any one looking to visit Angkor."

I booked Sam's Private Siem Reap Tour for my trip to Siem Reap after reading the many excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and I cannot begin to say how happy I was with our tour and our tour guide. Though we didn't meet Sam in person, we had an excellent tour guide in Bun Chhoub, who was just fantastic.I was traveling with my boyfriend in SouthEast Asia, and on our first day in Cambodia he became ill and was not able to visit the temples with me. We had met Bun Chhoub earlier that day to see the sunrise at Angkor Wat and it was so easy conversing with him that I had no problem leaving my boyfriend at the hotel and going out on my own to finish that days tours. Bun Chhoub was more that accommodating, allowing me to give the hotel his cell number in case of an emergency, walking around the temples with me, suggesting where to take photos, what to take photos of, and conversing freely about the temples, Cambodia's culture and rich history, and anything else. He put me completely at ease and, despite the circumstances, I was able to really enjoy myself. Bun Chhoub was so easy to talk to, it felt like I had known him much longer than I did. And most importantly he was fun - always sharing something historical, a story or just a joke. I would highly recommend Sam and Bun Chhoub to anyone looking to visit Siem Reap and having a fun experience while also learning a lot about both the temples and the Kingdom of Cambodia."

Although we didn't get a chance to meet Sam in person, we had an equally able tour guide in Bun Chuop, assigned to us. Bun Chuop was fantastic throughout the engagement. I believe one of the key aspects of hiring a private tour is that it should give you the flexibility to modify the program as well as to take it at your own pace. Bun Chuop did exceptionally well in both the areas. At no point, did we have a feeling that we had to rush things up so as to cover the next destination. Initially, our plan was to cover Angkor Wat on the first day of our tour, but Bun Chuop suggested that we push it to the next day as it was a Buddhist Holiday and therefore the top level on the main tower is closed for tourists. This is something we probably wouldn't have known without his help. His passion for the country and the desire to share the knowledge about its rich history made it a very interesting & interactive tour for us. Apart from that, what impressed us was how civic minded he is. He didnt hesitate to pick up used plastic bottles around the temple complex that may have probably been discarded by other tourists. I highly recommend this for anyone planning to visit Siem Reap!"

Rany was a pleasure - easygoing, well-versed on the temples, always on time, and passionate about his country and its people.

He customized our itinerary to our needs. My parents did not want to walk up too many steps and are strict vegetarians and Sam made sure that they had a wonderful time! We had cold towels and iced water after every temple visit waiting for us in the car and wonderful explanations of the sites we visited."

We found Sam and his company on Trip Advisor and contacted him with our details. Having only 1 day to be in the actual UNESCO World Heritage site we did not want to waste time.We took a early evening bus from PP to Siem Reap, arriving at our hotel at 2:30pm. We were picked up by our Guide Mr. Saruon and the driver at 9AM for a full day of temple tours. Mr. Saroun`s english was terrificc and his knowledge of the area impressive. I visited the sites 14 years previous and had spent 3 days touring, thus can attest to Mr. Saruon`s great knowledge.He is also a great photographer and took many pano-pics with the teens that they loved. We had lunch a local restaraunt that was terrific and were ever so grateful for the cold towels and cold waters that we received each time we returned to the van.Thank you for an AMAZING 8 hours of temple tours\u2026.. we are looking forward to returning to see more of this most magnificent place.Annette"

            "review": "One of our \"best-ever\" tour guide experiences. An acquaintance of ours recommend Sam Pho (sampho2@yahoo.com) as a contact to tour Siem Reap, Angkor Wat, and other temples. This led to one of the most pleasurable experiences we have ever had with a private, paid tour.Sam responded to our inquiry immediately. We provided basic info in our inquiry--when we would arrive, where we would stay, how long we would stay, what we wanted to see. The big deal for me was Angkor Wat, the World Heritage Site, which I have wanted to see for 40 years. But beyond that, we knew nothing about Siem Reap or Cambodia, so we asked Sam for suggestions for a three-day tour. Once again Sam responded immediately. He outlined a suggested itinerary for us, which, I suppose, was pretty much boilerplate for him, but it was brand spanking new for us. Moreover, his itinerary was extremely detailed, and he listed all of the included charges and all of the not-included charges, so there were no surprises. He told us what kind of vehicle would be used for the tour and promised cold water onboard, which, in Cambodia in July in 100\u00b0F heat, is a really big deal.We arrived on June 30, 2014, and left Siem Reap on a red eye flight on July 3. The only moment of tension for me was a last-minute email from Sam (the night before he was to meet us at the hotel at 8:30 the following morning) saying that someone else would be coming to meet us. This \"handing-off\" technique is common in Asia, I am discovering, and I was concerned about the result. Turns out that I was needlessly worried. Sokphai (pronounced so-fi, as in wi-fi) was a remarkable young man who spoke excellent English and was about as knowledgeable as anyone I've met. Sokphai is a freelance, licensed official tour guide, and he contracts his services with tour operators like Sam Pho. We became friends. I invited him and his wife to dinner with us one night, and he accepted and took us to a restaurant that serves traditional Camboidan food.For our part, we will use Sam Pho and Sokphai again if we ever return to Siem Reap, and I will not hesitate to recommend either of them to my friends.Joe Koppi"

His tour guide, Bun Chuup was very fun and accommodating, he had a lot of trivia and went out of his way to explain and even take our pictures, suggesting certain \"Tomb Raider\" poses to get even better shots! He was also very understanding when we got tired or when it got hot and we would take a rest. In fact, we felt bad for other tourists that didn't get tours because they wandered around aimlessly, not understanding the history and the meaning behind the carvings, and the temples. With Bun Chuup, we were able to understand everything. The car was a little ratty, with not much shock absorbers but it was comfortable and cool enough for the hot day in Cambodia. All in all, we really enjoyed our tour and will make sure to recommend his tours to other friends that go to Siem Reap. Thanks Sam! :)"

Cold water (plenty of bottles) was included. Savuon knows a great lot about the temples and the histoy of the people. It was truly a great experience! Just drop him an email savoun_siemreapguide@yahoo.com (the mix up of \"u\" and \"o\" in name vs. email is not a typo ;-))"

He did a great job as our guide ensuring we were able to see and learn much more than if we had been on our own. He is very knowledgable about the best times and ways to visit the temples, the history of the temples, Cambodia, and the region. Each day he picked us up in a meticulously clean and air conditioned car, had bottles of ice cold water for us throughout the day, and ensured we lunched in very good local restaurants. Lekh was unfailingly courteous and helpful - a joy to spend three days with him and his driver Gia. This was money well spent!"

Then our guide showed us around Angkor Wat before we went back to our hotel for some breakfast. After that we travelled around to different temple complexes in the area before finishing the day by watching the sunset from the top of one temple.The guide was friendly, knowledgeable, spoke good and easy-to-understand English. There are so many temples around Siem Riep and there is so much fascinating history behind them. We strongly recommend anyone who plans a visit to hire a guide. We thoroughly enjoyed it and we believe we got so much more out of our visit thanks to this. Without a guide we wouldn't have known what temples to go to, what the history behind them was etc. Our guide even knew when and where to take the best photos. :)"

He was great company and made it an extremely enjoyable day!! He also knew of the best spots for photos, and took some lovely ones of us too!!! We had such an amazing day, and are so thankful to Sam Pho for arranging it, Mr Kim for the comfortable ride (and the fresh mango he bought for us at the end of our tour!!!) and of course the wonderful Mr Vanny.

It's not an easy place to get to flying out of New York nevertheless, it had always been a place my husband wanted to go for years and recently we had the opportunity to explore the Angkor temples and the city of siem reap along with my in-laws. The history of the mythical angkor temples was brought to life with our tour guide Sam. He is knowledgeable and always patient in answering whatever questions we had for him. The intricate carvings on the stones of the temple illustrates the wars that took place over the centuries with neighboring cities, it also tells tales of mythological folklore of the battle of gods and demons getting to the nectar of immortality. I was in awe of the effort it took to bring those massive stones quarries there and the time it took to build the temple.Prior to leaving for our trip, our communication via email was easy and he responded quickly to my emails. I liked that Sam was able to provide a detail description of what our itinerary would look like for the three days we were there so when we arrived to cambodia, there were no surprises. Another thing that I'd like to mention was that my in laws are in their 70s. Although they are in great shape for their age, they do tend to get tired easily climbing stairs and walking on uneven, worn out paths can be quite the challenge for them however Sam was very attentive by making sure they're ok.Overall, we had an unforgettable experience. Thanks for making our trip memorable. -Jen & chieh"

            "review": "History brought to life!. We recently visited the Angkor Temples in Cambodia and due to some last minutes booking problems we found ourselves in need of a tour guide at 7pm on the night before our main two days in Siem Reap. We contacted Mr Sam and he was able to find us an excellent tour guide (Mr Leak)& a very sweet driver (Mr Kim) at this very late notice for the next morning. Our guide spoke excellent English and filled our day with lots of interesting facts and historical information about the temples from the moment he picked us up from our hotel. Much of the information is such that you probably won't find it in any of the guide books as only locals will know of such facts. To me, this alone made having a guide worth while. Also Mr Leak drew our attention to many areas of the complex (such as explanations of carvings and statues) and had we gone on our own I feel that we may have missed or ignored these for not knowing what they were. Also there isn't a real path way to follow around the temples so its pretty easy to get lost or not have a sense of direction and having a guide took this problem away. We were provided with cold drinks and towels throughout our day and were often taken away from the busy crowds to be able to capture great photos of the temples. Lunch was also at a place where few tourists go and the food was delicious. As the day drew on (and our tiredness in the heat also started to set in) Mr Leak was able to hold our attention very well and keep us intrigued for another few hours whilst visiting the last complex of Angkor Tom. All in all a very enjoyable experience and money well spent. I would highly recommend that anyone who is thinking about visiting the temples do so with a guide as this will bring the stones to life and especially with this tour operator as they were so professional from start to finish.

We contacted Sam at Private Siem Reap Tours prior to travelling and through our contact by email we were given a tour outline and costing. Sam was great. He was always early to pick us up and was very knowledgeable, looking after us so well that he added so much to the great experience we had at Siem Reap. We would thoroughly recommend him to anyone wishing to make a trip to Angkor Wat. We really appreciated having an airconditioned car, drinks etc on hand after our walking and also having the local history as we toured the ruins. Sam is really 4 star."

Our guide, Bun, is very knowledgeable about each temple we visited and all of the other sites we saw. His demeanor is very friendly and outgoing, which makes the experience that much better. He was a consummate professional at all times and ensured that all of our needs were met. If you're looking for a private tour guide while visiting Siem Reap, you would be wise to get in touch with Bun. He will customize your tour so that you see the things you want and maybe even some hidden gems that others may overlook. I would recommend Bun to anyone interested in seeing all that Siem Reap has to offer.I am convinced that our trip to Siem Reap was more memorable because of Bun. We both look forward to visiting Cambodia in the future. Thank you Bun."

We consider it some of the best money we spent on our trip through Cambodia. In February it is hot, humid and dusty at the pyramids. Having the airconditioned car to return to and cold water was such a relief I felt so sorry for the people in tuk tuks or on bikes.We received a quote from a competitor, it was twice the price! And honestly I don't believe it could have been twice as good. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable, his english was excellent. He knew all the great picture spots and the right time of day to be there, how to avoid the crowds and really enjoy our time at the temples. We went out to the fishing village on the Tonle Sap one afternoon and the boat ride was a welcome relief from the heat.We enjoyed the fact our guide was local. We received an excellent explanation of a Cambodian weeding (it was wedding season and they were everywhere) based on his own experience, learned some of his family's history and experience under the Khmer Rouge.We have already recommended Sam and his company to other travellers we have met. If you really want to get the most of your time at the temples- contact Sam. They were a professional top knotch outfit."

He was very responsive to my emails and was also very understanding about what we wanted on our four day trip. Our guide was Mr Sun and our driver was Mr Heng. Mr Heng was great. He didn't speak much English, but was super nice about the water and the conditions in the car. We all were not used to the heat and made every effort to make us comfortable. Mr Sun, our guide was truly amazing. He knew so much about all the places that we visited (Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Beng Mealea, Bantey Srei, etc) and it made the experience that much more enjoyable. He was also very accomodating to our desires of what we wanted out of our trip and we truly appreciated that. It's clear that he truly enjoys what he does, and makes an effort for you to leave Cambodia a little bit more informed about it's amazing history. Even though it was March, one of the hottest months in Cambodia, it was an unforgettable experience and we owe it to Mr Sam and his crew for making this possible."

I read about Mr. Sam and \"private Siam reap tour guide\" on trip advisor and chose them because of the high ratings and the fact that over 400 people said the same things. We were really lucky to share our 3 days with Sam and enjoyed getting to know him, about his family,and his country, as well as the historical side of the temples and their importance in the culture of Cambodia. I corresponded with Sam by email and we decided to do 3 days of tours instead of two after he let us know what other things we could see outside of the area of Angkor wat. His itinerary was perfect, and we drove with him in a Honda SUV with A/C, nice because it was really hot and humid. He provided cold water and cold towels inbetween stops. On Day 1, we went to Angkor wat first, but in through the back entrance which was shady and not crowded, and we were able to see the carvings ringing the first floor then go the second level and even up to the third. We also saw Ta Prom,Angkor Tom and a night cultural show with dinner which was enjoyable. On the 2nd day Preah Khan, Bantay Sreay, and hike to Kbal Spean, 3rd day sunrise at Angkor Wat, the beautiful, overgrown and unrestored Beng Mealea, and even had a boat trip to the floating villages at Tonlai sap lake.Our time with Sam was really great and that he shared so much of his life and family's history really made it helpful to understand Cambodia beyond just the temples and tourist sites. Even though our country fought a war in this region, most Americans don't have much understanding of the culture and history of SE Asia, or Indo-China. We felt blessed to have the opportunity to travel here, and our time getting to know Sam."

We only had one day in which to see the wonders of Angkor Wat and with nearly 300 temples we needed a guide to identify the most significant places to visit and to explain their purpose. The temperature was a steamy 43 degrees so an air conditioned car with cold water and wet towels was bliss. Mr Kongkea our guide was excellent, he spoke good English, had a great sense of humour and was very knowledgeable about the temples and the country as a whole. Mr Heng our driver was very careful and courteousMr Kongkea tailor made the tour to meet our needs, he was flexible and knew all the best places for photographs and avoiding the crowds. It is well worth getting up to greet the dawn as the light is beautiful and it is the coolest part of the day. Unless you are particularly interested in Buddhist and Hindu temples, I think one day is sufficient for most people who are reasonably fit and active. Take two days if you want only to spend a half day at a time.We spent 5-8am at Angkor Wat then returned to our hotel for a couple of hours rest before continuing on to Angkor Thom. We stopped at a Khmer restaurant for an authentic lunch (and t shirt purchase!). In the afternoon we visited the jungle temples and Elephant Terrace.  This tour was great value for money and I would thoroughly recommend it."

Thanks to our guide we had a great spot for photos away from the crowd and a great tour of Angkor Wat. After a breakfast break at the hotel we continued with our tour and visited the Angkor Thom temple and few smaller ones - but as impressive or even more than Angkor Wat. We had a lovely and delicious lunch break in a local restaurant. In the afternoon we continued our temple tour to visit the Tomb Raider temple - very impressive and the favorite of our younger son. Needless to say that at any return to the Van cold water and refreshing towel was waiting for us.On day 2 we started late at 8:30 for our tour to the country site and fishing/floating villages. I must say this is an absolute must and eye opener. After a great lunch break at a local restaurant we visited our last temple - the famous Indiana Jones one.We were impressed how seamless the whole logistics was working - no bad surprises, no waiting for drive or guide, excellent food, and a tailored tour program - what can you ask more :-)."

I guess if you spread it over 3 days you could take it easier especially in the heat, but 2 days was still quite alright. We were set on having an air conditioned car and when we arrived we saw that was definitely the right thing to do - it gets seriously HOT. The guys provide cold towels as well in the car which is a nice touch and they do come in handy!Our guide was very nice, but insisting on taking A LOT of pictures, and in the heat the only thing you want to do is hide in the car\u2026however in the end we were really happy that he made us go the extra mile with the photos, now we have some really great ones. Only thing I wouldn\u2019t recommend is that buffet dinner Apsara \u201cdance show\u201d (if I can call it that) they offer. It\u2019s a total rip off, even as cheap as it is. You can\u2019t really eat there (we didn\u2019t even book to eat there) because the food looks really really bad and the \u201cdance show\u201d itself looked like a rehearsal for a school play. I\u2019m sure there are probably good ones around to attend in Siem Reap, but it\u2019s NOT the one they will try to send you to.All in all I think they were good, would recommend them."

Mr Chet took us different directions to the masses, so that we got to see most of the sites with many less tourists, plus the best spots for picture taking, and made the two days personal and really left us with an warm appreciation to the people of Cambodia, and what they have gone through to date, and the reality that it was in our lifetime.We cannot recommend our tour guide is Mr Chet and driver Mr Heng highly enough. Mr Chet is highly educated, speaking many languages, with a board versus deep historical perspective.Amazing people - thank you so much!"

He was very knowledgeable about the history of the temples, showing us many things we would have missed on our own, showing us the best camera shots, finding shady spots, and has a great sense of humor. On the trip to the fishing community and to the floating village, Mr. Rithy told us about modern Cambodia - again he was very knowledgeable - this part of the trip was quite memorable, and well-worth the visit. Our driver Mr. Sat was a very calm, attentive, safe driver amid the streams of tuk-tuks, motos, and bikes. We truly enjoyed our 3-day tour - I would highly recommend Sam's company - worth every penny - I highly recommend this tour company."

Cliche as it sounds words/pictures can't describe the day. Tour guide, Vy Sovitou made our time at Angkor Wat amazing. So knowledgeable, and friendly, he filled our day with stores and history. He brought the day alive! He knew the best time to go to each temple to avoid the crowds, and always ensured that we felt safe and happy. Best tour guide and now friend that we were lucky enough to have experienced Angkor Wat with!"

The 3 days were great and Sam was full of information and very easy to get on with. A very polite guide and our driver Mr Heng was very nice also, dishing out water and cold towels when we required them. He responded to my initial emails very quickly, which is always good! They were always on time. Our children's ages were 16, 15 and 8. They all enjoyed it. It also included a visit to the floating and fishing village - this was interesting to see and worth it. Sit back at this point and watch how people make a living on the water. It gives you time to relax!Remember - visiting temples requires a certain code of dress. Ladies should have shoulders covered and if going to upper level of Angkor Wat, you need knee length shorts, or you could be refused admission. Trainers, covered shoes are good, open shoes, like flip flops/sandals are also ok - your feet will just get very dusty!We finished off with a Discovery tour on quad bikes, which was a lot of fun. We used the company Quad Adventure Cambodia quad-adventure-cambodia.com"

His English was perfect and he is very knowledgable about the city and the various temples but he could tell we weren't those type of visitors so he didn't yammer on the whole time about endless facts. It felt like he knew the type of day tours we were looking for and it was the perfect mix of information and conversation.Sam was great at directing us around the temples so as to avoid the crowds. I know that sounds impossible but somehow he did it. We would arrive as the bus tours were leaving! We would enter a chamber as others were walking out! He knew great spots to stop for photos and took great photos of us as well!One day we drive to Beng Mealea temple. Amazing! Much less crowded and so worth the trip. If you have more than one day you really must visit. Following that we went on a private boat tour of a fishing village. I was worried because these experiences are often a let down/boarder line depressing but we trusted Sam and it was great!In summary - we had a great experience and would recommend to anyone."

Fortunately for us Sam Pho kindly stopped in at the last moment and gave us a wonderful day's guided tour of Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm. He also threw in an early morning sunrise visit to Angkor Wat followed by a walk around an almost deserted Preah Khan on our last day.Sam was incredibly friendly and easy going as well as knowledgeable and well-informed about all the sites we visited and we got far more out of our visit by having Sam take us round than we would ever have down trying to do it by ourselves.

A bike would have been fun, but HOT. And a tuktuk would have been cheaper, but hot and uncomfortable.Sam ended up bing our driver and guide, and was awesome. He was prompt to meet us and SO friendly. (We found all the people in Cambodia sooo nice.) We had picked an SUV so we could be a bit more comfy getting in and out all day. We also had gotten the guide service versus just a driver, which we recommend -- there are those little things you just can't get on your own. And they take a ton of pictures of you.Sam was nice, attentive, and easy going. Easy to converse with him and he had a subtle humor that we both enjoyed. I wish there were a few more interesting stories/fables (\"It is said that...\" or \"Once the King did this...\") about the builders and leaders. Still very thorough on the build process and temple uses/history and talking about India or the French coming over. We found it all very interesting.About the temples themselves -- we didn't feel the top of angkor wat was essential once you factor in the line to get in, or more importantly the line to get out. We started at 9a and by 4p we were templed-out. So if you're doing sunrise to sunset, good luck. I wish we would have seen Koh Ker or Beng Melea and then only 1 or 2 local ones. Our favorites were Bayon and Preah Khan.Thanks Sam!"

He also knows the in-and-out of the places we visit. My daughter had a blast following Mr. Sun exploring and climbing throughout the ruins at Beng Mealea and being the boat captain on the Tonle Sap lake. We stopped by on the way to try out interesting local food from road side stands. It was a very memorable experience. I highly recommend touring with Sam and Sun."

Sam Pho was flexible in our schedule, accommodating our special requests, but he also kept us on track to see all the major sites. His kind personality combined with an immense historical and cultural knowledge made the trip a joy. Sam helped us get not only an immersive experience at all the historical sites but also local area highlights and what to see in Siem Reap itself. Our time with Sam was the highlight of our Southeast Asia tour. We would highly recommend him to anyone visiting the area."

Mr. Sam, well verse in English understood our shortcomings and was most obliging to arrange for drivers on the day he was not available. Mr. Heng, was a conscientous driver and we note our safety was his concerned when he drove us around on the first day. On the 2nd day Mr. Sam Pho was our driver and guide. He brought us to places where there were less crowd and we were able to take good shots of pictures of Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Ta Phrom and explained to us the histories and carvings. Though \"water village\" was not in our itenary, Mr. Sam recommends us to visit the \"water village at Tonle Sap\". This visit was \"the\" peak of our stay in Seam Reap.On the 3rd day he arranged a driver that took us to other attractions out of the city. We decided to take a taxi to Phnom Phen and Mr. Sam arranged a skill taxi driver that took us to Phnom Phen, avoiding the potholes along the way and the huge \"crowd\" that were gathering at the city. Mr. Sam even called us when we arrived in Phnom Phen to check whether we have safely arrived. If you read this review and decided to go to Angkor , try getting Sam Pho as your guide !!!!"

We wished we had more time and one more day( total 4 full days) would had been even better. Nonetheless, we felt sure we will be back and Mr Sorm will be our choice guide again. His knowledge and service goes beyond a few words and certainly make us felt very comfortable with his well spoken English. We appreciate his patience in explaining and answering the endless questions that we asked and allowing us ample time to take photo shots with his recommendation of choice spots with angle & lighting conditions."

Mr Sear, our tour guide is one outstanding tour guide in more ways than one. in terms of command of English Language, he is pretty decent. Mr Sear does not speak with a heavy Cambodian accent, hence he is easily understood by us, making your trip to Cambodia very enriching. Mr Sear is extremely dedicated. On delivering information about Cambodia to us, he tries his best to be as detailed as possible and he handles questions in a forthcoming manner. When he feels that some of us are unclear of what he had said, he goes the extra mile by giving a more thorough explanation. By virtue of this, it is also evident that Mr Sear really knows his country inside out! He seeks for our opinion before making decisions or changes to the trip. Every choice he makes is for the our own good. For example, whenever a crowd starts to form at one of Angkor's temples, he would lead us to quieter corners of the temple so that they can hear him explain about the temple more clearly. If you happen to be finding a guide for your trip in the kingdom of temples, I highly recommend Mr Sear. This is one decision you won't regret!!! You may contact Mr Sear via email: sontikvong7s@hotmail.com"

Prior to our arrival we decided on some changes so we could include temples further out of town - Sam was very flexible and made the changes without any issue.We had Mr Sun Bunthoeun as our tour guide. Mr Sun was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and flexible. During the drive out to Beng Mealea (70km) we got a detailed history of Cambodia - all told from the heart - it was fantastic! We went to Beng Mealea on the second day and whilst it is out of the way, it was the highlight. Climbing through the temple overtaken by rainforest is a must do experience; plus, the food at the local restaurant was the best Cambodian food we had on tour!!On day one we did the temples around Angkor. Mr Sun's knowledge of the sites and the carvings were first rate and brought the whole experience to life.Our driver, Mr Sieha was very safe and kept us well stocked with cold water and chilled towels. This was important, as exploring the temples is extremely hot and thirsty work!We will be back next year as there is so much to see and 5 days did not do it justice. We will be using Sam Pho and Mr Sun again next year. I highly recommend others to follow my lead."

Sam was a very knowledgeable, friendly and customer focused tour guide who always knew when and where the bus tours were carting the flag-toting, peace-sign posing mega tours so that we did exactly the opposite of the group tours. The result was that we had several ruins and temples basically to ourselves over our 3 day - 2 night visit to Siem Reap.We contacted Sam based solely on his Trip advisor reviews and the fact that as a couple getting our first getaway without our two young children in a year, we did absolutely no pre-planning for a guide and started cruising Trip advisor while waiting for our departing flight from Bangkok.We called Sam at 10am on his cell and he was there when our plane landed in Siem Reap at 11:30 am. We discussed our goals with Sam on the way to our hotel and came up with a plan of what to see and when. Our experience was phenomenal. I had Bayon temple to myself and maybe 20 others at sunset whilst tour buses disgorged a stream of tourists to climb a local hill for sunset. At 6:30 am, I had the \"Tomb Raider\" temple to myself and six other souls for an entire ethereal hour that I will never forget. I was able to fire off some two hundred photos as the only company I had was a group of four with a guide and three - four lonely planet types wandering with journals or cameras. Forget photoshop\u2026.I have photos of entire ruins with no one but the attendant Monk to be found. Sam's working knowledge of the temples and the local tourism was what allowed us to be able to pull this incredible two day trip off.Thank you Sam!"

The van was large, comfortable and air-conditioned, which was a blessing because it was very hot during our stay in late November. The iced towels and frosty bottles of water were plentiful. The pickup from the hotel was right on time, the sites we saw were awe-inspiring and the location for lunch had tasty, reasonably priced food, iced beer, cooling fans and clean toilet facilities. Mr. Voeum had lots of information about the sights we saw along the way. We were never rushed and could wander around or rest as we wanted. Because we travelled at a decent speed, I was able to take dozens of photos from the vehicle. Mr. Heng is a careful driver who kept us safe in dense traffic. The trip to the floating village was a unique experience. I would highly recommend this tour company and the staff. We were treated to a glimpse of Cambodia's history that we will never forget. Be aware - there is a LOT of stair climbing and walking over broken ground, so wear sensible shoes. Bring US$ for the temple and boat tour fees - makes life easier. Be generous with your tips, but avoid the super-aggressive hawkers around the temples."

Consistent with the reviews I have read, Sam replied to my email enquiries promptly, and provided a suggested 3-day itinerary with quoted prices. All activities excluded from the prices were clearly stated.Slight criticism is that although I emailed Sam to confirm the pick up time two days before the scheduled date, Sam emailed me again quite late the night before to inform me about the name of our tour guide and that the pick up time would be half an hour later. (As I did not check my email the night before I only found out the next morning.) On the day, the driver turned up half an hour late, but Bob our guide did turn up on time and he gave us a run down of the schedule, as well some background about Cambodia and himself, and we managed to make up for lost time during the rest of the day so it wasn't a big deal.We highly recommend Bob our tour guide. He was knowledgeable about the various temples and sites we visited, providing some of the historic and religious context of the sites, carvings, etc. as well spots for taking good pictures. He was flexible and customised our itinerary to fit our preferences. e.g. on our 2nd day we had some spare time between tours of temples, knowing that my husband likes taking pictures of insects, Bob took us to the nearby butterfly farm, where there was a helpful member of staff to take us through the farm, the work they do, and introduced various butterflies in the farm to us. Bob has a very personable character and is very inquisitive himself. We had interesting conversations not only about the sites, but about families, living in Cambodia, politics, languages - which made our experience in Cambodia much more memorable!Thank you Sam and Bob!"

We had a small group of four. We emailed Sam when we arrived in Siem Reap on Thursday. He responded promptly and we had a two day itinerary all set within hours. What makes Sam fantastic is his pleasant personality and his knowledge of Cambodia. We felt his genuine passion in sharing his country and culture with us. He speaks fluent English and he is extremely accommodating when planning a tour. Sam took us to different temples in Angkor Wat and even composed some of our pictures. He customized our tour to avoid other tourists. He also made sure that the places we saw and activities we did benefit the local community and showcased the culture. For example, on our second day, before visiting the floating village, we stopped by a local market to buy school supplies. This was a suggestion by Sam. Wow, his suggestion of handing out the school supplies to children in the floating village made the experience one of the most memorable moments during our 3-week vacation through Asia. The children were incredibly polite and gentle. You will never forget this experience. Sam took the time to stop at a local floating restaurant afterwards and joined us for a drink as we talked more about the Cambodian culture. Sam\u2019s driver is equally pleasant and is always ready with a cold bottle of water and/or a cold towel to refresh us when we return to the car. They are a dynamic duo.

Sam was easy to understand as we had trouble with some of the people we came in contact with due to their English but not with Sam which is very important with all the information Sam gives you. Sam also always had a smile & a friendly personality which made touring with him pleasant. You can't go wrong using Sam's services & I would definitely recommend him."

He is so passionate about his job and his country. It was a pleasure to spend the day with him. We learned so much about Siem Reap, Angkor Wat and Cambodia in the day we spent with Sam. I'm sure we could have spent much longer. We loved the area - Angkor Wat was without a doubt the highlight of our (world wind) 21 day tour around South East Asia and much of that was due to Sam's fantastic tour. Couldn't recommend him highly enough."

We were extremely happy with their service since the very beginning. The moment I emailed Sam I got a response straight away with his recommendations for a 2 day tour around Siem Reap and the temples. After a few requests from my side, he tailored the tour specifically to what we wanted making it a very special 2 days. Our guide and driver were both excellent. Mr. Rani (Han) turned up bang on time to pick us up the first day. We spent 2 days visiting various temples and getting a great insight into their history due to his extensive knowledge. His English was perfect and he made sure he were very well looked after throughout the trip. We also visited the floating village, which I highly recommend. We visited one that, although was a bit far away, was not touristy at all and we were by ourselves when we got there. The road to the little boat is also lovely, driving through rural local villages. They also take you to lovely little local places for food, away from the crowded touristic ones we saw on the way or near the temples. Everything from the planning to the end of the tour was perfect so I will certainly recommend booking it with them if you want a great experience in Siem Reap."

Spend about a week there, but even that seemed less to explore the place. Angkor Wat, Beng Mealea, Bayon, Banteay Srey, Ta Prohm and many more wonders, assured to transport you to a different time... Moreover, we were a group of photographers, there for photography, wanting to get out at insane odd and early hours to get the right light, appropriate sunrises and sunsets. Then find just right places to relax, get authentic local food, some nice coffee and great desserts. This was all made possible by Sam. He really catered to all our whims and fancies, and really well. Would highly recommend him to anyone visiting Siem Reap. And of course, would not hesitate for a second to do our next trip with him again. Thanks for everything Sam."

Mr Chet spoke perfect English and was both interesting and engaging throughout the day. We did think about not going to the proposed buffet dinner but luckily we decided to go.

His reply was speedy and accommodating - little did we know that he had travelled back on the night bus after voting in his home village in the Cambodian election! Sam was amazing. I loved his knowledge and the background information and history he provided. His car was comfortable and cool. He also took us to a great restaurant near the temples because we said we would like to taste a genuine amok. The flavours were wonderful. After day 1 we decided to do a second day with Sam a couple of days later. He took us further afield to Banteay Srei and the lingas and again was knowledgeable and interesting. He also accommodated my additional request on our return journey to stop at Angkor Wat again and encouraged us to explore as long as we wanted. He provided water and refreshing cleansers and was always tuned into our needs. I would recommend Sam to anyone visiting Siem Reap. He is a genuine, hardworking and dedicated tour guide who added great value to our experience of Siem Reap. Thank you Sam."

He was punctual, kind, and had a good sense of humor (which is important when you're spending all day with your guide!). We were jet lagged and tired, especially on the day we went to visit Angkor Wat at 5am, but Sam conveniently planned the day with multiple nap/shower breaks back at the hotel so that we could be full of energy when we needed to be. He did indeed know all the great photo spots, knew how to use both our cameras well, and always offered to take interesting shots of us wherever we went. We had such a fun time, and highly recommend Sam to anyone!-Kims from New York"

It would probably be a disappointing vacation for us if not for Sam and his air conditioned car because we, originally, planned to just rent a tuktuk driver for a day. Imagine the heat, the humidity and the red dust clinging to your clothes and sweaty body on your way to see the temple ruins... not cool! Sam was recommended by a friend who went there a few years ago and I was grateful that he responded quickly to my questions and provided us with a 2-day itinerary that fits our schedule. He was our guide on the first day and took us to see the floating village on Tonle Sap Lake and the temple ruin at Beng Mealea. He gave us a satisfying knowledge about the livelihood and culture of the people. I, particularly, enjoyed the tour of Beng Mealea because we literally climbed over the rocks, crossed narrow, steep rocky paths and go through dark tunnels! It was an Indiana Jones adventure! After a day of exploring, we were given some cold water and towels which is very much welcomed. We also love the reserved front seats for us during a dinner-buffet show. The 2nd day, we were guided by Mr Sun and our driver, Mr Khom. Overall, I recommend having a private tour guide especially by Mr Sam and company. They will provide you with adequate information about the temples, will plan the time to go where there are less tourists, take you to a great lunch at local restaurants and will even be your very own photographer. Thank you so much for the wonderful tour of Siem Reap!"

Mr. Chet was also very welcoming and it was easy to get along with him.

We put together a 2-day itinerary: Day 1 - sunrise at Angkor Wat, Bayon, Baphoun, Celestial Temple of Phimeanakas, Elephant and Leper King Terraces, Ta Prohm, Bantey Srei. Day 2 - Angkor Wat, Beng Mealea. Bayon was my favorite and Bantey Srei is a must see; if you have time Beng Mealea is amazing (the sights along the drive alone is worth the time). Our guide was Rani and he was VERY knowledgeable; I would highly recommend asking for Rani. Not only does he have more knowledge of the temples than you can ever remember, but he is an expert in photography. He will make sure that you get the best pictures! Make sure to go with all of his restaurant recommendations. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience that will never be forgotten!!!"

Mr Rani took great care to take amazing pictures of us throughout our tours and he has a knack for it- the pictures turned out incredible, and we will always be grateful for his thoughtfulness when we look back at them. Mr Heng was a very courteous driver. Mr Sam also set us up with wonderful seats at a delightful Apsara show that evening.

We then traveled a few hours to Beng Mealea, which was interesting, but also brief.

We didn't think we had enough time to do Cambodia too, but found some good flights and added it to our itenerary. We would have only 28 hours in Cambodia. I've never used a guide before nor joined group tours...we usually prefer to travel on our own so I was hesitant to put my experience into the hands of a stranger. We looked over several reviews on Tripadvisor and I eventually picked this one. We were planning and changing our itenerary up to a day or two before the start of our trip, and Sam was always very prompt in replying and made great suggestions. When we arrived we were picked up by our guide, Nin, right at the airport. He took us to our hotel so we could check in, and even assisted us with the check-in process and made sure the hotel would confirm our flight the next day on Vietnam Airlines. We then started our tour- just driving around town he was a wealth of info on culture, history, business- and when I asked to stop for a bite to eat he took us to a local spot by request for a Cambodian sandwich...a great stop we would have never found....and our meal for two with drinks was $2. We immediately felt comfortable with Nin and enjoyed all his stories (he shared the story of his own wedding which may be one of the more memorable stories from the whole trip...amazing!). Where he really shined was at the temples. Angkor Wat and the other temple complexes are so vast it's hard to know where to go. He took us on an efficient whirlwind tour of several of the top sites, and amazed us with how much knowledge he had and his ability to interpret the different carvings, the various struggles kings had at the time of construction, transitions from Hinduism to Buddhism and back, the evolution of Cambodia from the 1st century to present, and historical and personal stories about the Khmer Rouge. His education and english are first rate- I truly felt that I learned as much from him in 24 hours as I would in a semester long 300 level college course. Even better, when we needed a break from the heat or our brains were too full of info...he knew where to get the best sticky rice or a cold cheap beer...and of course he always had ice cold water for us. As many have already said, he also knew the best spots for photos and how to avoid the crowds. I felt bad for the throngs of people that didn't have a guide who would walk right past spots where he took us to show us what were often the most interesting parts of a temple, or the best photo we would get for the day. We also wanted to visit a market with a very tight timeframe and he worked it in getting us in and out and giving us directions for seeing all the variety of the vast marketplace.Had we known what our experience would have been with Nin we would have stayed in Cambodia longer. My only tip is to pass on the dinner with the Apsara dancing, or if you want to get a feel for the dancing just make a brief stop. I'm sure Sam or Nin could recommend a different restaurant or night activity."

Rani took us on the major part of our tour and Mr Saroeun was continuously supplying us with cold water whenever we saw him after a certain part of our trip. It felt like Rani was an encyclopedia because he seemed to know every nook and cranny of Angkor Wat, Bayon Temple and the rest of Angkor Thom! I never realised I would learn so much on the trip and now I'm able to look at my photos and appreciate them a lot more. Sometimes we didn't understand why he would lead us to a certain spot until we realised he had situated us in the perfect angle for a photo. He just seemed to know what we needed and was very helpful! Besides our lunch being at a place that seemed a little isolated and had no other people at the time overall everything was amazing!If anyone is considering booking a tour I would strongly recommend you consider them!

Rani was not only a very knowledgable and patient guide, he was a wonderful photographer and also looked after our two children (9 and 7 years old) when we wanted to climb to the top of Bayon Temple and Angok Wat. Even when there were crowds of people, somehow Rani managed to subtly move us to a spot where we felt like we were the only ones there and had a great sense of when to take a photo and also the best angles and positions.

We found Sam Pho on Trip advisor;exchanged a few emails and negotiated a 3 day comprehensive tour starting at 5am next day with private guide Mr Sun in A/c car with driver Mr Sat. Highly recommend this service to anyone especially, when it is hot & humid. We were provided with endless history/stories by Mr Sun of all the temples, places of interest we visited in & around Siem Reap, whilst Mr Sat happily greeted us with cold towels and water after each visit. The great photo opportunities pointed out by Mr Sun along with his endless energy,care and consideration not only to us but to other travellers, as well as his great humour has left us with wonderful memories to share with family & friends! Thank you again Sam Pho for providing a great service to visitors of Siem Reap. Barbara & Robert, Western Australia"

We were recommended to engage Sam Pho as our tour guide by one of my colleagues who visited Cambodia in 2012. Reviews in Tripadviser were most encouraging so we booked Sam. From the time we arrived at Siem Reap International Airport on 26th June to the moment we departed this airport Sam and his colleagues were most impressive with their delivery of service.We were met at the airport by Sam and transferred to our hotel which was about 15 minutes away. The next day we visited the temples in and around Angkhor Wat - from Sunrise to Sunset which was interspersed with breakfast & traditional Khmer lunch. Our tour guide Sear Voeurn was simply superb; his knowledge of the temples, patience in explaining points of interest, ability to take us to the right spot at the right time-timing is very important for photos here as the the position off the Sun in the sky gives such varying perspective of the different \":Gopuras\" (towers); was second to none. The driver Mr. Heng was obliging, safe and smooth.The punctuality of Sam Pho and Co was wonderful. All in all in was a most enjoyable visit and we intend visiting Cambodia, Siem Reap in particular, again and will not hesitate to engage Sam Pho."

All the excellent reviews are correct. Sam was always punctual,courteous and happy.  On the first day we went to the temples and he made sure we got to the best spots for views and photos whilst avoiding the main crowds. His knowledge of Angkor was fantastic and we learnt a lot. We had lunch at a family restaurant which was very yummy. On the 2nd day we did the sunrise and Sam helped me get the best photos. Then we went to the floating village, which we loved. I have nothing but praise for Sam and would not hesitate to recommend him. Cambodia is a wonderful country and Sam helped us get some fantastic memories to take back home."

Just tell him what you prefer and he'll make it happen :-) Dont hesitate to ask anything. He will answer any of your queries to the best of his knowledge. We booked the 2-day angkor tour (1st day at angkor and 2nd day at beng melea, khbal spean and bantay srey) I have to say it was worth every penny! Mr. Kea, our guide, was very informative. I love how he would show us, not only the famous corners of every temple, but also off-the-beaten paths that would give us a new perspective to the place. We are extremely grateful for his hospitality and for catering to our demanding group photo shoots (he even suggested a few of our poses :D). Another great thing is that our guide and driver were always on time. :-) And! We got the best seats in the house for the Apsara Dance Show! Be sure to book it through Sam.I would definitely recommend Sam Pho to organize your tour :D Even for us budget-conscious travellers, this tour was very much worth it. I wouldnt have it any other way. Thank you so much for arranging everything :D"

He is a great guy with a very nice personality and he never got tired of telling interesting stories about his country. His knowledge about everything is enormous. We had day 1 in Angkor with the typical \"red-eye\" start at 5am to see the sunrise. We stepped out of the hotel half asleep but our Tourguide and the Tuk Tuk driver Mr Neang greeted us cheerfully.Voeurn is not only a great Tour guide, he also has a great eye for detail and knows where and how to take the best shots. It was very hot and humid during the day, Voeurn and his team always provided refreshing water after climbing up or through another temple.I've visited Angkor 3 years ago but it was much better structured this time with Mr Voeurn and more fun. His English was perfect and he showed an honest interest in my culture so is was more of an exchange than a straight forward tour.If visiting Ankor in the future I would highly recommend Sams tours and especially ask for Mr Voeurn!!!"

Our second guide Mr. Sam Pho is very knowledgeable about a lot of things. We were throwing questions left and right during those long drives and he managed to answer every single one of them. He informed us a lot about Cambodia, it's people, it's tourists etc. Plus his smile never left his face, even though we were walking and climbing so much. He would always look back to make sure we were safe while trekking through the woods.The service includes an air-conditioned minivan with loads and loads of chilled water and wet tissue. Very essential things while travelling in such a hot and dry country.Do visit Cambodia, it's beautiful. And be sure to hire a guide, they know a lot about the culture, what to see and what to do. :D"

He lives in Phnom Penh and we had just Saturday and Sunday morning to tour around. I contacted Sam Pho and asked him for some help. He immediately sent me back a detailed itinerary for the short trip. He customized it according to some things I had requested, one of which was an elephant ride. He also was able to quickly answer all questions via email. Besides having an awesome schedule planned for us in advance, we had the absolute pleasure of having a driver named Mr. Heng. We were about 15 minutes late to the hotel and he gladly waited for us. He drove us around to all the places in our itinerary and when we had extra time, he took us to other sites within Angkor Wat. We did not use a tour guide, but he was so helpful in explaining so much about the site to us. He talked to us about different temples and gave us excellent background information. He always had water and towels for us and helped us take awesome pictures around Angkor Wat. If you are looking for a tour company, I would absolutely recommend this company. They will help you from start to finish and they will customize everything to your needs. Also, I would like to note that is was about 35 degrees (100 F) around the time we went and it was excellent to have an air-conditioned car to sit in after walking around the sites all day in the sun."

My wife decided to do a bit of both, with a guide on our first day, then DIY on the other days. We are very glad we did, and even more glad we called Sam Pho.Our guide, Mr Voeurn, was unbelievably knowledgeable about all the temples and history around them. He was able to bring all the temples to life and really help us understand the significance behind the structures and carvings. He was with us from dawn until sunset, but paced the day fantastically and molded the schedule around what we wanted to see and do. He also knew when to go to places to avoid crowds and where to take the best pictures. And finally, Mr Voeurn was incredibly good natured and very passionate about his job, which made him a pleasure to be around for an entire day.We recommend getting Sam Pho as a guide to anyone who plans to visit the Angkor temples."

Based on the TA reviews, my wife and I opted to hire Mr. Pho's company over the tour guides offered by the Borei Resort, where we were staying (highly recommend, but that's a different review), for three full days of mind-blowing Angkor exploration. We were extremely fortunate to get Mr. Chet as a tour guide and Mr. Heng as our driver because these gentlemen were SOMETHING else! For three magnificent days, we were on the road by 7:30am and back around 6pm. They were so courteous, warm, and friendly... they quickly became friends. Mr. Heng always took great care of us and especially of my wife in the air-conditioned car when Mr. Chet and I would go out by ourselves. Mr. Chet's historical knowledge is based in a deep fascination for the subject material and he's simply an extraordinary story-teller, which I believe is is crucial to fully appreciate Angkor. In addition to his fabulous grasp of ancient Kmer history, Mr. Chet is also extremely knowledgeable when it comes to Cambodia's horrifying recent history of the Kmer Rouge atrocities. In the end, there's no reason to go with any other tour operator when this one's this good. Mr. Chet and Mr. Heng were consummate professionals and gentlemen and just a heck of a team! My only constructive feedback would be that during the hottest months, the guide could offer to take the clients back to their hotel in Siem Reap for a rest and swim before going back out. It gets HOT (!!!) and the hotels are never more than 15 minutes away. That would be such a terrific option for customers. In the end, we requested it and they happily complied, but I think others would really appreciate that option built into the day's itinerary. Thank you for a truly unforgettable experience on my wife's and my honeymoon and we are so glad to have two good friends in Cambodia."

Most importantly, Mr. Chet is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about his country. He showed genuine excitement when he was sharing interesting stories about the temples. When we were confronted with some very daunting rocks at Beng Mealea, we happily followed him because we knew he wanted to show us something very special. We also had a chance to visit the floating village on Toule Sap Lake and see how the local fishermen/women live. This was our third private tour in Southeast Asia and we cannot say enough about the experience. The value in having a private tour guide like Mr. Chet is being able to have a real conversation.

Sam provided us with a detailed itinerary and recommendations as well as handling a number of questions from our side. He was extremely knowledgeable on Cambodian history and culture as well as having a very professional and friendly demeanour. His car was very clean and comfortable with a large supply of fresh bottled water the we were offered at every site. We were very satisfied with the service that was provided and would recommend Sam to anyone considering a private tour."

Sam and I had agreed a broad outline of what he thought was possible/ would be suitable - given we had one yound child with us - before we left. He was always on time, well prepared and hugely informative as we toured round, and struck up a great rapport with my daughter in particular. The food stops were well chosen and inexpensive. The fact that Sam was so friendly and enthuiastic made the trip very pleansant and he managed to balance the interest of the adult (dusty monuments for dusty old folk) with some climbing and animals (elephants, monkeys) for the kids."

Sam responded very quickly with details of the tour, which was much appreciated. Our guide Mr. Sun arrived at our hotel at the appointed hour and we set off in a cool and comfortable Toyota Camry in 43 degrees of heat, driven by the calm and competent Mr. Dy.Our three days were a sheer pleasure with these two men. Mr. Sun is a great guide, very knowledgeable and interested in showing us the sights to their best advantage, and also find good food stops. Sam and Mr. Sun designed the timings of the tour to minimise our contact with other tour groups, which made the whole experience even more satisfactory. At our request, he flexed the programme to accommodate visits to some places a little further from Siem Reap, including the magnificent Beng Melea (our favourite ruin) and Kulin National Park (including a swim under the waterfall -fantastic. The extra price that Sam quoted for this trip was reasonable and well worth-it.Mr. Dy negotiated some pretty awesome roads, always polite and friendly, and very keen to make sure that we were comfortable and well-hydrated with the cold water that he kept in a cool-box in the boot.The company can be proud of these two men, who made our holiday very special. We would thoroughly recommend Sam and his team."

We had Mr.Saroun as our tour guide and as well as being extremely knowledgable of all the sites we visited he is a people person with a friendly demeanour and happy to answer any questions we had. Mr.Saroun was always smiling which set the tone for our trip and we really enjoyed having him as our tour guide. Our driver was Mr.Heng and he was a very safe driver & always waiting at the meeting point for us on our return with refresher towels and cold water which made our trip very comfortable as it was really hot while we were there. Also, on our last day we decided to revisit a few temples and had Mr.Sam Pho as our driver - Sam was able to organise to drive us around at very short notice and we only decided on the spot which temples we wanted to go to. Sam was very hospitable and had no problems driving us around at such short notice which was really convenient for us.We really enjoyed our trip visiting the temples and sites of Angkor and would definitely recommend these tour guides to our friends."

I enjoyed the sights that we saw and the history was very interesting. He was able to answer my questions. At times I felt we were moving a bit slowly and would have liked to see a bit more but this could be because I'm not used to guided tours. I usually roam on my own. The first day was purely Angkor Wat and we saw a fair amount. The second day we ventured abroad to a temple outside Angkor Wat and a Buddhist temple with a reclining Buddha followed by a stop at a waterfall. Day two was mainly driving with Mr Rani and Mr Reng (our driver). I would have maybe preferred another schedule as it felt like we spent most of our day driving from one place to the next but this could not be helped due to distance. It was a really neat experience to climb through the temple as this is not possible in Angkor Wat. Overall it was a good experience. Fresh water and cooling cloths were available and I felt that Mr Heng was a good driver and Mr Rani was very pleasant and knowledgeable."

He recommended Mr. Rani and turned out that he's a fantastic guide. But let me go back to Sam first. During our conversation through e-mail, he was very kind to reply with all my inquiries about Siem Reap. I asked for his help on our hotel and I even asked him if we needed visa. I know I can search that online but I was too lazy lol but still he replied and answered all my questions. So really nice helpful guy. Now about Mr. Rani. When you hire Mr. Rani you're not just hiring a tour guide. For me Mr. Rani is more than that. He's a story teller, a very very good photographer ( he knows camera shot tricks and really knows how to operate a camera) and a patriot. You can feel his emotion when he's telling you a story about his country. He will tell you not just the history of the temples but also the present situation of Cambodia. Oh and he also knows where to take you to have a picture perfect with less crowded tourist. And our driver Mr. Heng, also a wonderful man. I travelled with my parents who are both in their senior age and he provided like a plastic case box to help them with the stepping in and out of the van. And they always open and close the car door for you (which I never felt comfortable because its just too much). Gave us water every time we finished visiting a temple one after another. As you can see its like hiring a butler. So over all I highly recommend the courteous team of Sam or Rani to be your guide when you visit the wonderful city of Siem Reap."

Sam collected us from the airport the evening we arrived and took us to our hotel. We felt a bit awkward that we'd decided not to have his services as a 'guide' at Angkor Wat etc. but only to take us about in his airconditioned car. Sam didn't seem to mind at all and was a wonderful driver and gave us a great deal of information all the time he drove us. At lunch time he took us to a quiet cool little family restaurant. I think Sam was discretely mindful and considerate of our mature age. In the evening we very much enjoyed a buffet dinner and cultural show Sam had booked for us - in fact he had booked a table for two in a prestigious spot near the stage! Next morning he took us to view the sunrise at Angkor Wat and then a trip through the countryside. He asked if we would like to hike from the carpark half way up one of the few mountains out of Siem Reap to the top. We're not young but we're active and healthy and the hike needed just that. The hike was well worth the effort and we were grateful of his suggestion. Anyone booking Sam will not be disappointed."

However, with Sam's guidance, I realised that I've learned a lot more about Ang Kor Wat, and the lifestyle and culture of Seam Reap.Sam was very dedicated and gave us many suggestions for places of interest. What I found most fascinating was the floating village - which I never had the intention to visit (nor aware of its existence).The only drawback about my Seam Reap trip was that the food was nothing to rave about (being Singaporea, food matters!!!). Though I had very opposing views from people who visited Seam Reap, claiming that Seam Reap has the best food in the world.Though this review came late, but I have already introduced a few groups of people to engage Sam's service over the last 8 months!Thank you Sam!"

In our two days with him, we were able to visit Tonle Sap lake, Angkor Wat, Bayon, Bantay Srei and Angkor Thom among others. We also enjoyed a sumptuous buffet dinner with an authentic Cambodian cultural presentation (take not: he reserved us front seats even if we're fashionably late for the show). Indeed, Sam can take you to everything in Siem Reap--from best restaurants to best spots for picture-taking-- and he will make sure that you'll enjoy the tour. P.S. I truly appreciate his honesty during our last day, I left my wallet in his van, he returned even if he noticed it at home already."

Setting up everything with Sam ahead of time was a breeze and when we arrived in Siem Reap he was there to pick us up at the airport. The agenda Sam devised for us was incredible; we spent two days touring the temples and our guide Rani could not have been better explaining all the history behind the various places we went to visit. The highlights included eating some amazing amok, taking a boat tour of the Tonle Sap, and hearing about the extensive history of the Khmer Empire from our guide Rani. Like most first time visitors to Siem Reap we had no idea that the temples at Angkor Wat are just the tip of the iceberg. Angkor Thom, Banteay Srei and the Bayon were breath taking and we would never have been able to see as much with such ease had we not booked ahead of time with Sam. If you are planning on visiting Siem Reap and want to see as much as you can with an experienced guide Sam is the only way to go."

We cannot fault Sam or the service for anything after yesterday's experience. Not only was he punctual, he was easy to contact via email before his service. His English is very easy to understand and his knowledge of the area and its history is like an encyclopedia. There was nothing he could not answer. His honesty was shown when we left our mobile phone in his car and he returned it after we were dropped off. Anything he recommends you do is worth it. He also knows where to have the perfect pictures and he took some amazing shots of the 2 of us throughout the temples. Sam is open to suggestions and was happy to sit and wait when we decided to look around a little more, he was never pushy or rushed us at all. Sam also has the experience to avoid the crowds without missing any of the sites which was appreciated, sometimes it felt like we had the temples to ourselves. All in all, we highly recommend using Sam for your tour guide whilst in Siem Reap and we will most definitely be recommending Sam to our friends and family. and to Sam, just remember mate, it's \"Fair Dinkum\"."

We had so many questions.......Sam didn't just tell us the answers, he would take us to experience the answers. I had done a lot of research on history, culture and the temple complex before our trip, however, I was amazed at the size and beauty of this area. The Cambodian people and their willingness to share their way of life was something that Sam helped us experience and we will be forever grateful to him for this gift. We are already planning our return.As stated in other reviews Sam has a great vehicle and provides water and cool towels. He doesn't overload you with dates and names.....he lets you experience the areas at your own pace. He knows how to avoid the crowds and the best places for photo ops. Sam would pull over on the side of the road so my husband could harvest rice with a group of local people, climb a palm tree to learn about making palm sugar, or stop to eat BBQ snake at a roadside stall. Great memories!All of this for just over two hundred dollars for three days. Best money we ever spent. Thanks Sam and see you next year."

There is no way we would have gotten a sense of life and culture in Cambodia without him. Sam's English is very good, which was a big plus. He also knows the best times and approaches to the temples to avoid crowds (to the extent possible) and to keep you in the shade when shade is available. We would highly recommend Sam for trips in and around Siem Reap.

I cannot imagine visiting the temples without someone like Chet providing the history and amazing stories. Thank you Chet!If I can make some recommendations it would be: 1) The van could use an upgrade. The back seats were incredibly uncomfortable for our longer trips. 2) the PRE-determined restaurants for lunch were \"touristy\" expensive and not very good. By day 3 we asked to stop for fresh fruit at a market and enjoyed having that for lunch. 3) It might be a good idea to change the brand of bottled water they give out. 2 of us could not drink it as it had a weird taste (!?!?)Chet was definitely the highlight of our 3 days....AhKuhn :-)"

            "review": "Touring the temples of Siem Reap. We had never visited Cambodia before but after reading the positive reviews on Trip Advisor I contacted Sam to arrange for him to act as our driver and guide during our visit to Siem Reap (I am in my early 50s and I had my 19 year old daughter with me). His communications were prompt and he put together a proposed itinerary that we were very happy with. I contacted him on our arrival in Siem Reap by cell phone and everything worked out exactly as planned (apart from the sunrise over Angkor Wat which of course he had no control over since the sun was hidden by cloud!) Sam has a great command of english and was happy to share his love of his country with us. He answered all the questions that we had about Cambodia giving us a real insight into life in Cambodia and how the country is progressing. He picked us up at the arranged time and took us to arrange our passes for the Angkor Park before heading into the park. He had arranged the itinerary so that we did not get to the temples with all the crowds of other tourists which was a much nicer way of seeing things. (We were often just leaving as the masses were arriving). He helped with some of our photos and they are fantastic.The nice cold water and towels that he had waiting for us on our return to the car was always welcome after being out in the heat. We came away with an improved understanding of the history of the area and the significance of the temple region. Sam is very knowledgeable about Cambodian history, the culture and the people. Sam was flexible with the itinerary and happy to make the changes that we wanted as our time with him progressed. Sam was everything that we had hoped for. There were no unscheduled trips to shops run by friends or anything of that nature which we certainly came across in other places. We changed our itinerary to take in the Silk Farm and enjoyed a visit to the Land Mine Museum (all at our request) and he was completely happy to accomodate us. Sam also helped us with our travel arrangements and when we decided to fly to Bangkok instead of travelling overland he took us to a friend of his who was a travel agent and who was able to provide us with airfares that were much better than anything that we could find on the internet. We enjoyed Sam's company and would definitely hand his name and contact details on to friends who were wanting to visit the Temples of Angkor Wat. (In fact we have friends travelling to Siem Reap in December who are keen to have his contact details so that they can arrange a tour with him as well). The exceptionally positive reviews that he gets on Trip Advisor are well deserved and we would have no reservations about recommending him to others. His car was very comfortable and clean. Sam can be contacted by email or by cell phone. I copied in all of the email addresses below when I contacted him. sampho2@yahoo.com sam.angkordriver@gmail.com siemreapservice@gmail.com angkortaxi@gmail.com  +85599616606  +85512519719"

            "review": "The only way to visit Siem Reap and the temples. My girlfriend and I visited Siem Reap for 4 days in November 2012. We had reached out to Sam in August as we planned our time in this great city. His responses were punctual and thoughtful, and he provided a suggested itinerary for the 2.5 days we spent touring the area, and temple complexes. His itinerary covered all of the major temple sites, and included a couple of gems (including Beng Melea - about 50 km from Siem Reap, but well worth a visit). Generally, the days consisted of about 7 hours of tour services - with about 60-65% of the time at the sites, and the remainder in transit or at lunch. Sam chaffeured us around in a modern, air-conditioned SUV. He was attentive throughout the trip - even on the long car rides - and thoughtfully answered even my most obscure questions about the temples and Cambodia. He was extremely informative about the temples (having been trained by the temple advisory service), but also had an especially impressive handle on Cambodian culture, economics and day-to-day life. Besides his knowledge, charm and comfortable transport options, the greatest asset Sam offered to my girlfriend and me was peace of mind. He helped us organize an efficient and fully-encompassing trip, and allowed us to focus on the experience rather than worrying about finding the next tuk-tuk, building trust with a new guide, or procuring directions to a new site. On our (rather sad) trip to the airport to leave Siem Reap, we mentioned to Sam that we had regrettably failed to purchase a Cambodian flag to commemorate our time in this great place - without hesitation, Sam assured us that he would help by sending us a flag in the coming weeks. We felt this gesture was a perfect final memory of our time with Sam - although he is a hired guide per se, in reality, his greatest passions seem to be in connecting with people of all backgrounds and creeds through the gift of friendship, and also in showing tourists to Cambodia what a wonderful and warm place this oft-misunderstood country really is. In summary, I would highly recommend Sam to any friends or colleagues visiting Cambodia. He is trustworthy, attentive and eager to please. He made our time in Cambodia unforgettable, for all the right reasons."

He fulfilled the role of both driver and guide extremely well. He was highly recommended by a 30-something couple, friends of our son, who live and work in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and we made our reservations months in advance. He did not disappoint! Sam is very personable, his command of English is very good and his overall knowledge of Cambodia and the Angkor Temple Complex is superb.Our times with him at lunches were great, going to family-owned eateries and sharing the local cuisine. Everywhere we went people knew Sam. We were in good hands. Upon my spouse's question about sticky rice, he found a roadside vendor's stand and we had sticky rice in bamboo shoots. We can't say enough about Sam! His rates for 3 days were worth every Riel."

His friendliness and accommodating nature made us feel so at ease everyday! Sam knew the many temples and exactly when to visit them so that we wouldn't be surrounded by crowds of tourists, but could instead get a lot of pictures without the tourists in them. Sam recommended that we see Sonle Tap and this was very much worth our time!! We really appreciated Sam's car getting us around and his extra effort to always have cold bottled water and towels for us.

After booking our flights, arriving and beginning our holiday in Chiang Mai and finishing our holiday in Bangkok we decided that we would travel across the border to Cambodia, Siem Reap for a couple of days as we were travelling for a total of 15 days in all and decided that we had the time to do this. We were definitely not disappointed. I contacted Sam Lim prior to our visit and asked him for a quote for a suggested itinerary etc. He responded to me very promptly and gave excellent suggestions on what we could do during our stay but was also very happy to make any changes as we went along. There were four of us in our group, we had a van and were provided with cool water and wet towel wipes which were absolute gold (at every stop). It was very hot! We stayed for a total of 3 days in Siem Reap. We were collected from the airport by Sam, and after being completely looked after during our stay delivered back to the airport for the final leg of our holiday in Bangkok. We found Sam to be an excellent tour guide. He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and knew exactly where to go and where the best photos could be taken. Nothing was too much trouble for Sam. He was a really nice guy, so to was Mr Heng our driver. They basically couldnt do enough for us. We enjoyed our stay in Siem Reap very much."

We contacted Sam to hire a guide to take us around the mystical temples of Angkor which does require a certified tour guide if you want to enter the temples. Sam was incredibly responsive, courteous, and professional in helping us to plan our itinerary. He helped organize the tour with his coworker, Rani, a certified tour guide and driver. We informed Sam that this trip would be celebrating my husband and my wedding anniversary. Sam passed this information along to Rani, and we could tell that they definitely took this into account when planning our tour. Because of Sam and Rani, my husband and I had one of the most amazing and romantic experiences! Can't express how incredibly adventurous and romantic it is to be exploring all the ancient ruins with your husband!Our tour guide Rani was absolutely incredible, and I would highly recommend that you request him as your guide. Rani was our personal photographer, certified tour guide, and safe driver all in one! He picked us up everyday on the dot, and was always punctual. Rani provided us with individually wrapped cold towels and bottled water throughout the tour, which helped mitigate Siem Reap's hot weather. Rani also knew all the clean bathrooms for the attractions or area you are in! Which was a HUGE plus. ;) We were comfortable throughout the entire trip.Rani was a very safe driver, and we felt absolutely comfortable in the SUV he drove. I would recommend taking a car from temple to temple as it provides a welcoming cool air conditioned respite from the outside heat. Plus it is much faster than a tuk tuk, which is fun to try out. But in terms of actually touring the temples (esp. if you want to visit temples further away such as Banteay Srei), a car is highly recommended. Additionally, Rani was incredibly accommodating, and your schedule can be tailored according to how much you want to pack into your schedule - so you can choose to visit many temples or take your time and have a more relaxing time at each one... Our itinerary included sunrise at Angkor Wat (breathtaking!), exploring all three levels of Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm (the famous jungle temple featured in Tomb Raider), Banteay Srei (the \"pink\" temple about a 45 min. drive from Angkor Wat), and Bayon at Angkor Thom. This was accomplished over two days and we still had a very relaxing time. We were so impressed by Rani's incredible knowledge of the temples. He was very informative, knew every single detail, from the details of the carvings to how the temples were built, historical events, etc. and was able to answer all our questions. If you are also interested, he also spoke about current state of affairs, even contemporary culture and society - really gave a unique perspective in experiencing Cambodia. And now we have several hundred amazing pictures documenting the great memories made on our trip. My husband and I love taking imaginative and creative photos to capture our travels - and Rani knew all the BEST spots - our pictures came out amazing, usually when we go on trips, my husband and I don't get too many pictures together as we have to ask strangers - but now we have numerous photos together from our trip to Siem Reap- all of them came out great - Rani took multiple takes to make sure everything was captured perfectly - he even took candid shots too of my husband and I hand-in-hand!Rani truly went above and beyond, and even took us to a great supermarket with a great selection of fruits and packaged goods, and even drove us to the Old Market area to pick up souvenirs. Thanks to Rani, my husband and I had the most amazing wedding anniversary in Angkor, and best of all, our memories are perfectly captured! We highly recommend him to take you around Siem Reap!"

Also he was flexible and changed our itinerary based on our personal wishes.He was VERY knowledgeable about the temples and spoke excellent English. He also kept us away from \"tourist traps\" and recommended good places to go see a show and have a massage when we asked him (he did not try to \"sell us\" to other companies which is common in the region). The car we toured in was fully air-conditioned and he supplied us with cold bottled water all day (including cold wet-naps to freshen up).

Being in Cambodia for the first time, we expected a hot and troublesome trip since we were worried about the language barrier and had no idea which places to visit - there are so many temples and historical sites in and around Siem Reap. Sam was kind enough to provide a suggested itinerary with all the details of cost for each item (entrance, tour fee, distance in kilometers to place of visit, etc) and he continued to correspond with us via email as I wanted to make some changes to the itinerary. He made all the arrangements we wanted and we managed to see the places we intended to visit within our short stay of three days. He also made sure that we had constant supply of cold water and wet towels throughout our hot and sweaty trips to the temples. For one of the dinners, he booked a front seat for us so that we could see the cultural dance performance Apsara and we had an enjoyable time watching the performance and taking photos for a good viewpoint.Sam managed to get us Mr Saroun, an informative tour guide who not only told us all we wanted to know about Cambodia and Angkor Wat, but also helped us take loads of family photos and individual photos with interesting prespective. He also assisted us in finding a photo studio when we asked him (it was not in the planned itinerary) so that we could dress up in traditional Cambodian costume Overall, Private Angkor Wat tours managed to give an all-round view of Cambodia for us and is good value for money for families travelling to see Angkor Wat. I would highly recommend this tour guide and driver service especially for those who do not want to rush to follow a normal tour and want to make their own itinerary at a comfortable pace."

Whenever we wanted to visit some place in specific out of the schedule, he would find a way to make time for it. In addition, he was always punctual when picking us up from our place of residence. Our normal day would generally go as follows: We wake up and eat breakfast on our own and we're picked up at a set time after breakfast. We're driven by Sam or his driver (also a great guy) to whatever we have planned to see that afternoon (for us, it was generally the temples). After a nice long day of temple walking (usually until sunset), we head back to our place of residence, stopping along the way to do whatever we wanted to do out of the schedule. To sum it all up, Sam is great."

I googled them and let him know what I wanted to do. Sam wasn't available (and I didn't need a tour guide) so he set me up with one of his VERY capable drivers who did well with his English. Sam was clear with the prices (VERY reasonable for an amazing day). We had a marvelous adventure as he took back roads, stopped for a \"Bamboo Cage\" for lunch (yum -- you must try it), and came up with additional places to fill my day. He asked if I'd like to attend a dinner/traditional dance that evening (for a princely $12) and I said \"yes\". When I arrived at the restaurant (the driver came back to the hotel and took me - no extra cost), I found that Sam had a front row table reserved for me!! GREAT photography and Sam came in to meet me in person.All in all, a fabulous experience that I would recommend to ANYONE. He is completely flexible in your interests with suggestions.

For us this was great as we never normally get any great photo's with both me and my hubby. One thing that I particularly appreciated about Sam was he seemed to be very intuitive, he picked up immediately when we had, had enough and were ready to move on. My husband I think especially appreciated this. The lunch in his family restaurant was also lovely and something that we would not normally have done. It was lovely to hear Sam's own life journey and how he became a tour guide, I appreciated his honestly and would not hesitate to recommending him to anyone."

We were very interested in seeing the temples, but were not sure the best to included in our short period of time and were eager to learn more about the history of the temples, the country and the people. After reviewing on TripAdvisor, we asked Sam (about 2 days before arrival!) if he could put together a tour that included sunrise at Angkor Wat (awesome) and the best things to see in his experience. He put together a wonderful tour that avoided the timing of some of the huge tour groups (all the big tours hit certain temples around the same time of day!). Our guide, Nin, and our driver, Mr. Heng were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. The car was clean with AC and cool towels and water for each stop and Nin gave us a great history at each temple and as we drove between sites. We also went to the Floating Village and Beng Mealea (go...Beng Mealea is a little farther of a drive, but practically empty and so amazing to see the countryside and true village life on the drive as well as the temple in such a raw, unrestored condition!). Even when it poured on us in Beng Mealea, Nin continued despite the rain so we could still see the temple! Even with our last minute booking, Sam was very responsive and was able to adjust our schedule with the rain so we would have a better sunrise. lastly, Nin was great with the camera and often volunteered to take pics of the two of us. They came out great and we have more \"couple\" shots here than the rest of our 2 weeks visiting Thailand combined! I would highly recommend for anyone wanting to see the best of Siem Reap, understand the culture, people and history, and avoid the huge tour groups!"

Sam had suggested a visit to a fishing village which we thoroughly enjoyed and gave us renewed energy. Also Sam seems to structure his tours to miss the big groups, either visiting at a different time of day or from a different entrance which is fantastic. At certain times we were completely alone which was such a privilege. The temples themselves are wonderful. The carvings breathtaking and the history fascinating.

As we were 3 people in our group, it seems to make more sense to get our own private tour guide than joining a tour group. Once you get to Siem Reap, you can either hire a taxi driver (and do the touring on your own while he waits) or hire a taxi driver and a tour guide. I was a bit afraid to just get any tour guide once we get there so I booked Sam's services ahead of time. I like that he is running it by himself so that if he's not available, he's not going to send you somebody else (like it happened to other people with other companies). Sam's English is excellent. His knowledge is amazing. I loved it when he was telling us about Ramanaya... and how you can see illustrations of it in the carvings. He is also a very good photographer :) and he knows where are the best spots for the best pictures. He knew exactly when places would be busy so he would adapt the itinerary.Sam's car is very comfortable (air-con HONDA SUV) . He provides cold bottled water. Depending on the length of the trip, he can suggest itineraries. we didn't do the fishing village trip. We ate at two restaurants while sightseeing and it was very good. At night, he dropped us off for the apsara dinner (cambodian dance). The buffet was average at most. Dancing was good.It would be even better if he could find a better restaurant (that would have apsara)You might be able to find a guide a bit cheaper but he won't be as good and nice as Sam!"

Last minute planning was done for this trip, so I contacted Sam (2 days before my departure) and he replied promptly with some suggestions. As he was not available at the time, he arranged for Mr Chea Nin to be my tour guide, also a car and a driver. They were punctual and accommodating. With limited time, I could only manage 3 sites (Angkor Wat, Angkot Thom and Bayon). Mr Chea Nin is a fantastic and passionate tour guide. I learned so much about history and culture in one day. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe and really glad to have good company. Not to mention, he took great photos for me, too. They took me to a local Cambodian restaurant for lunch, we had authentic local cuisine, where we continued discussing about Cambodian food, ingredients and its similarities with other cultures in Southeast Asia. I finished the tour around 4 pm, good time for taking a break before they came back to pick me up at the my hotel again around 6:45 pm to go for a cultural show and dinner. The show was beautiful, the Apsaras are so graceful and skillful, it seems like they just float and glide on stage! The dinner was also educational!Thanks to Mr Sam for making the arrangement... definitely not disappointing."

Sam Pho replied promptly with itinerary options and detailed fixed costs for the 2 days we had available. He was prompt, knowledgeable and very good with our children. As promised there was plenty of cold water and refresher towels available and the car was in good condition. Sam provided excellent information at the different locations and took numerous family photos of which he had had obvious practice. The tour suggested and the order that we visted sites meant that we were able to avoid the large tour hordes which improved the experience for us.

Sam was a major part of making our trip to Cambodia special and memorable. Not only is Sam extremely knowledgeable on all topics of Cambodia culture, religion and politics but he also is a patient and compassionate person. Prior to our trip, Sam gave us several different itineraries to choose from. He worked with us to tailor a tour that fit our interests. Sam was always professional and timely when we met at our hotel. It was a wonderful experience to learn about the local culture and also get to know Sam and learn more about his own life and how he met his lovely wife. Sam was flexible with our itinerary and was even kind enough to take us to professional massage parlor and wait an hour for us. His recommendations of local foods to try and things to do during the evenings was spot on. Sam enhanced our experience of Cambodia through frank conversations about the politics of the region. My husband and I would never have known the intricacies of Cambodian politics if it weren't for Sam. His kind and generous nature are perfect for the profession he is in. I would recommend Sam to anyone and everyone that is visiting Siem Reap."

            "review": "\u201cSam Pho Provides the Best Cambodian Tours!\u201d. My wife and I recently travelled to Siem Reap, Cambodia to experience Cambodian culture, cuisine, and of course, to see and learn about the wonders of Ankor Wat and the other acclaimed ancient temples in the area. This was one of the best tours we have ever been on and highly recommend Sam Pho, our tour guide, because he provided an amazing experience.Sam is extremely professional, detail-oriented, and down-to-earth. He is highly knowledgeable about the history of Cambodia and the surrounding region, Cambodia culture, cuisine, architecture, religion, and folk-lore. He is very friendly, energetic, and really cares about his clients. He speaks Cambodian and English very well (and perhaps some other languages as he is very intelligent and cultured).Sam helped my wife and I plan our trip before we evern arrived, recommending places that are must-see attractions and those we should avoid as we began to set up our trip from half a world away. Sam arranged for a private air-conditioned car to pick us up from the airport and escort us to our hotel and did likewise for the trip back to the airport (even transporting us back himself and stopping at an ATM per our request). Sam recommended great hotels, restaurants, and the best of the many open-air markets for us to experience (because Siem Reap has many different markets).Our hotel was amazing. It was centrally located just a very short walk to the market area and numerous great restaurants. It was beautiful, fantastically clean, the service was extremely professional and friendly, and it had a phenomenal pool and breakfast we enjoyed each day.As for the official tours, Sam was extremely flexible in customizing the exact experience to meet our desires. He took us in a private, air-conditioned car to many different amazing ancient temples. We saw the ruins of ancient Hindu temple with beautiful, intricate wall carvings and great picture opportunities. We also walked through many other temples that day. At all times, Sam would explain the history, significance, and specialness of each aspect of every place we visited. He took us to special places to ensure he took the best pictures for us and the best times and also helped us avoid any long waits. Sam is very knowledgeable about the area and made sure we stayed safe, too. Sam was extremely flexible and responded to our interest to taste palm fruit and \"palm\" sugar/fudge. He stopped at a wonderful place in the country for us to interact with very friendly local people who ended up giving us our first taste of palm fruit and palm fudge for free -- just excited to share their culture and cuisine with us. There were some great handmade wares for sale by the local villagers, too.On our second day, we had another tour with Sam -- this time to Ankor Wat. It began very early in the morning so we could be sure to photograph the breath-taking, once-in-a-lifetime sunrise on the majestic temple grounds. It was truly amazing and, as usual, Sam made sure to take amazing pictures for us. He explained everything with such detail and passion. He answered all of our questions. We also visited other amazing, famed temples, such as the one from the \"Tomb Raider\" movie. He provided plenty of cold, bottled water and cooled face wipes, and made sure we were always comfortable and had everything we needed. He also took us to a local restaurant in the village area owned by trustworthy people. They were so nice and the food was phenomenal. Sam recommended some local foods for us that are special to that particular region of Cambodia that would suit our individual tastes. The food was delightful, bountiful, and reasonably priced. (I highly recommend trying Amok).Sam also brought us to have a wonderful buffet meal with a great selection of delicious food. He made sure we received a table at the very front of the room -- right in front of the stage so we could enjoy the traditional \"Cambodian Finger Dance\" without any obstructions (and again, to be sure we could capture the experience on video and photo).Sam Pho is a great person and nice guy. He will make you have an unbelievable, unforgettable, personalized experience. You will have lots of fun, learn a lot in a relaxed environment, and truly enjoy your vacation -- whether you are looking for an adventure or simply relaxation. According to our research, his knowledge, sense of humor, and the level of experience you will receive are unmatched, especially at the reasonable rates he charges. Our experience definitely confirmed that research.We wholeheartedly recommend Sam for any tour in the Siem Reap area! If you go with Sam, you will have a wonderful experience and you will never be sorry that you picked him as your tour guide. Thanks again for a great trip, Sam!!-Andy and Jacquie"

My friends and I decided that as we only had limited time in Siem Reap we would do an organised tour and as Sam Pho had been recommended we contacted him a week before we arrived and soon had a tour organised with suggestions on what temples to see and a 3 day itinerary to mull over. We were assured that Mr Rani would be our guide and would meet us at the hotel on the day after we arrived which he did. Mr Rani picked us up in a 4 wheel drive and took us on a journey around the highlights of of the vast archelogical park that houses Ankor Wat, Ankor Thom and various other historic temple sites. Mr Rani's knowledge of the temple sites and background information was excellent and he took time to point out various highlights at each sight. His suggestions from what sights to see to where to buy local crafts and what restaurants to go to were all excellent. He took us to a local place for lunch on the first day near Ankor Wat which did a delicious Chicken Amok for a very reasonable price. We also did the trip to Tonle Sap lake and fishing village which was well worth the time to get there and back. Having an aircon car and a driver who knew where he was going and who had a plentiful supply of cold water and cold towels as well was also a bonus. Our experience was very good and I would recommend Sam and Mr Rani to anyone looking for an english speaking guide to Ankor Wat and beyond."

Sam had everything we were looking for in a guide: knowledgeable of the history and culture of the area, willing to tailor trips to meet our needs, charming and kind, and remarkably good at spoken and written English. (We did not meet any other guides--or indeed many Cambodians at all--that spoke English as well as he.) He guided us on trips to a number of Angkor Wat-area temples, to Tonle Sap Lake, and to Phnom Kulen Mountain. Our experiences were consistently excellent, and we would highly recommend Sam to any English speaker looking for a guide in Siem Reap."

This saved going back to town for lunch. Make sure you go to Ta Promh for the trees entwined with the temples. For females, wear long pants and sleeved shorts as one area of Angkor Wat requires this.

Howz that for service and commitment !An extremely like-able fellow, my kids too really took to him and that really made a difference when you're touring with demanding kids. His prices are very reasonable - and definitely cheaper than options from the hotel and what I saw in brochures. Note that in my case, he handled only the planning and travel logistics - He drove us around but arranged for a separate tour guide ( named Chet) for us who was also quite good. He did mention that he also does the guiding from time to time depending on his schedule and energy levels( it's an exhausting job driving around and then having to walk and talk for hours and his working hours on a touring day typically start at 4 am and end well after dinner time!).Highly recommended."

I do a lot of research prior to our travels and usually do not take tours. However, in my readings I kept coming up with these fantastic reviews of \"Sam\" in Siem Reap. Since it was a private tour, I contacted Sam and he replied immediately. This was 7 months before our journey and fortunately he was available.As mentioned, we booked Sam for 2.5 days and he gave us a proposed itinerary. It was very comprehensive that covered both a sunset and sunrise vista. He took us to temples that were quite far away from the main area, and as someone else mentioned, he knows the area extensively as we were able to avoid most of the large tour company hordes. He is very professional, knowledgeable and open to any conversation about Angkor and Cambodia life in general. He has a great car (Honda CRV) with seat belts for all (a concern we have after travelling is some countries). We brings water and fresh face clothes which was very considerate. All is all, a definite highlight of our travels in South East Asia. Would I hire Sam again? Without a doubt, YES!!!! We was a fantastic guide."

Would HIGHLY recommend Sam Pho and team for the once in a lifetime experience in visiting and getting the insight into the temples around Siem Reap. Also the day we went with Rani it was an on-off again rainy day, Rani beioing the type of professional that he is actually stopped at his friends shop to borrow an umbrella for us , should the need arise that we needed it. An added bonus, cold waters and moist towelletes.Sam also was able to get the two of us front row table at the Apsara - Dinner show, Excellent as well. Thank you Rani and Thank You Sam for a most enjoyable and memorable visit to Siem Reap , Cambodia.Harvey and ValerieVancouver , Canada"

Extremely knowledgeable and entertaining and Sam had a terrific knack in finding the quieter spots around the temples and suggesting places to get the best photos. We visited all the main temples and also visited the 1000 lingas which turned into a fantastic nature tour with Sam pointing out birds, reptiles and insects. A wonderful experience. The driving was top rate, not too fast and very considerate. We can't recommend Sam any more highly than this. A definite plus to your trip to Siem Reap and the temples."

We found him to be extremely friendly, knowledgeable and informative about not only Angkor Wat, but about all things Cambodian. When we asked him a question about some of the local food available at the markets, Sam had driven to take a detour to show us a special market, and even bought us a Khmer spices after we finished our cooking class attending! (not to mention all the cool stuff you told us about bugs and termites!) Getting to see and learn about the many temples we toured was fantastic (of course) but probably just as interesting was getting to learn so much from you about Cambodian customs, food, and history. We would highly recommend Sam as an English-language tour guide to anyone. My wife and I having daily cold waters, the cool towels, and the air-conditioned SUV are all huge assets to the services he offers. We also really appreciate how his helpful have been in pointing out good photo opportunities, not to mention the many photos he so kindly offered to take for us.

In addition to guiding me through the temples, Sam brought us to see many other noteworthy sights in Siem Reap, such as the, fishing village on the great Tonle Sap lake, Cambodian Cultural village, arranged featured lunch at his parent in-law kitchen and a dinner where we were able to see a lovely Apsara dance performance and had front seats and plus and plus advantage of his service is provided unlimited ice cold bottle waters, refreshing towels every time we got back to the car after heat of Cambodia tours.

Rani was our tour guide and him and his driver were amazing. Rani tells great stories, is very personable, and is very honest. If we didn't go with him, all the temples would have looked the same after a while. But because we went with him, we got to recognize what made each temple unique, and got to appreciate the historical significance and artistic intricacies of each temple. The driver was also a lot of fun, very polite and hardworking. Every time we got on the car he would open the door for us. If you are to go to Angkor Wat, I would highly recommend hiring them, because it made our Cambodia trip. Our family has traveled to a lot of places (a new place every year) and have hired some tour guides, but they're by far the best. They also offer very reasonable and good prices."

After much researching on both the internet and personal recommendations (I am a flight attendant), we chose to use Sam Pho. Sam is fantastic in many areas. It is perfect that Sam acts as both your driver and guide - so you are not paying double the fees. He drives an air-conditioned Toyota Camry, which is in good repair, and he is always punctual. From our first internet contact with Sam, we could see that he is enthusiastic about his job and he truly wants to create a memorable and personal experience for his clients (who feel like family throughout the days of the tour). Sam is very friendly, experienced, speaks good English (important when you are visiting sights that likely you may never again return to and you wish to gain as much knowledge as possible during the visit), and he is very knowledgeable of Khmer history, Hindu and Buddhist culture, architecture and mythology. His assistance with photography is an added treat that you do not appreciate til you return home and see how incredible some of the photos are. He works with the individual client to come up with an itinerary that is stress-free and exceeds expectations. Sam is flexible and honest (We decided part way through our trip that we wanted to visit the Land Mine Museum. Sam added that stop without additional charge. We also changed our minds about not taking the bus from Cambodia to the Thailand border, but rather flying. Sam quickly offered to take us to Bangkok Airways downtown office ) Sam goes the extra mile in helping to create amazing lifetime memories. He took us to his home where his family runs a small restaurant. We dined there reasonably, experiencing very fresh local food. We had the extra bonus of meeting Sam's mother-in-law, toddler aged niece, and young nephew. Throughout the tour, Sam provided us with chilled bottled water, and \"cold refresher towels\" Sam did not take us to any shops or artisan stores where he would get a commission or referral fee, as we'd been warned about many guides.Because or the spectacular time we had with Sam Pho, we are eager to return to see more of Cambodia. We travel extensively, and we can sincerely say that you will not be disappointed if you choose Sam."

He even took us to excellent places to eat and recommended fantastic Khmer food especially his in-laws restaurant (fish amok was so yummy) and taking us to a children's school in the floating village so we could hand out school supplies. He showed us the nightlife scene and even took us out to an interesting place where many locals go to have a drink. With a very early flight in and a midnight flight out, Sam had no problems working around our schedule.

We are Yankees, learned out about Sam via Trip Advisor. All raved reviews he has attracted our preference and advanced thought, he will be our great host for Siem Reap Tours. We emailed to inquire about his private guided tours for us including 5 star hotel reservation. We were very impressed with prompt reply with suggested itinerary for 3 days and very details in term of costs of tours that we are going to pay for any admission fee, tolls, special evening dinner with cultural show ( had good front seats and yummy Khmer buffet ) and what\u2019s attractions we are going to visit for our 3 days etc.., totally no hidden costs so very convenient for us to bring enough cashes. For 5 star accommodation, he booked us a very nice Deluxe Double Room at Sokha Hotel with very reasonable, cheaper than we do our own through internet booking from home and that is a such great hotel has good buffet breakfast , nice salty pool, good location and helpful staffs. First day our arrival at late evening, he came extra miles and spent his times to greet me and my wife at the air-port with our name on his sign-board then send us to hotel. He helped to take care of our hotel registration form till finish to make sure we could go to bed early and have comfortable sleep. Second day he picked us up from hotel at 9 am with an excellent air-con, very clean SUV. We went to visit Angkor Wat the 7 world\u2019s wonder, Ta Prohm the Lara Crofts temple and inside temple out he has a lot of explanations on histories, myths, architectural style and founders. Afternoon we had lunch at his wife \u2018s parent restaurant that we had plenty of authentic delicious foods, fruit shakes and especially Milk Fruits the local fruit that we have never eaten before. We continue to Bayon the interesting stunning Buddha Faces before heading to hotel pool and chilled out. Evening visit cultural show with great front seats and buffet dinner. Third day we got up and had breakfast early around 7 am before heading to Bantey Srei the citadel of women and its detailed carvings made on pink sandstone. Continue to scenic drive up to Phnom Kulen to viist a river of thousand lingas carved on the riverbed ( phallic symbol based on Shiva god ), active pagoda and magical waterfall that has attracted many local tourists to visit all special times of the year. Lunch at local place on the way, good but still thinking of Sam\u2019s parent in law kitchen much more better. Afternoon we were lucky enough to reach Beng Mealea the sprawling jungle temple has more vegetation than Tomb Raider and only a few couples remnant on the site. We were playing Indiana Jones on the ruble and very interest with this temple natural state. Head back to hotel around 5 pm and pool. Forth day worth to get up early at 5 am for fantastic first light of sunrise at Angkor Wat temple that its 5 towers looked like Silhouette against to neat sky. Back to hotel for breakfast and bed. Afternoon around 3 pm Sam picked us up from hotel and heading to Kompong Phluk the fishing village homed about 3000 people living on stilted houses along the shore of Great Tonle Sap Lake. It is beautiful village, worth boat trip and saw the real ways of people life. Back to hotel at 6 pm. Fifth day we were very hard to say bye to Sam and leave his country once he does air-port send-off for us at afternoon and we told him definitely to come back here again to meet you and your beautiful country. Sam is truly super tour guide that we have never had for our trip around the globe for 15 years. His courteous attitude and guest\u2019s orientation was brilliant and he must be highly recommended, deserve 5 stars rated as top tour guide and Cambodia tour coordinator."

We were very lucky enough to have Sam as tour guide during our recently 5 days tours when we were there. We had organized Sam to pick us up from air-port and bring us around for 4 days. We had explored many temples as we were expected including famous Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, Ta Prohm, Preah Khan, Bantey Srei, Phnom Kulen, Beng Mealea, Koh Ker and great Tonle Sap lake and everything turned out fabulous experience for our holiday. Sam was awesome, friendly and very informative. We were amazed at how excellent Sam\u2019s English skill and his own knowledge\u2019s temples, Cambodia cultures and politics, Khmer authentic meals recommendation and we had a great chat and discussion with him beside of temple tours. I cannot recommend Sam and his services highly enough."

As I only had one full day to complete the tour Sam was great is suggesting a couple of options. We agreed on the options and kept in touch up until when I arrived in Siem Reap. Sam was great and organised Mr Saroun (Guide) and Mr Pok (driver). They were a fantastic crew who arrived at 5am to pick me up, from here we saw many of the best parts of the Temple area (as could be achieved in one day). The history of the temples, special photo spots and best times to visit that avoided the masses really made this day special. It was a big day, but the best way to see so much in a short time. Well done to Sam and his team."

He went above and beyond as a tour guide ( I got sick and he took me to the pharmacy and acted as a translator for me). Sam is everything that you would want in a tour guide: he is professional (on time), answers communications promptly, knowledgable about Angkor and Cambodia, flexible, likeable (just a great guy to hang out with) and speaks excellent English. My friend and I spent two days with Sam visiting Angkor Wat and Kbal SpeanmHe offered us so much to pack the days with that we had to pare the itinerary down! Just from conversing with us in the car, he got that we have a strong interest in local life and food (how it's grown, local plants we don't see in the US) and he stopped at a cashew nut farm where we were able to learn so much from the owner, showed us where water buffalo were hanging out as well as seeing cassava farms. We hired Sam as a driver because we thought we didn't need a guide for the Temples as we were only sight seeing for 2 days. He was generous enough to tell us what to look and share his knowledge in detail for before going into each sight when he could have just sent us on our way. This was our mistake and in hindsight we should have hired Sam as a guide and driver. If you are visiting the ruins, definitely hire both his services! When I come back to Siem Reap, I will be calling Sam again."

Sam is friendly, punctual, funny, outstanding tour guide, informative and has wealthy of knowledge\u2019s in histories, country fact files and enthusiastic about his civilization. He brought us to see all the main attractions with his comfortable Honda CRV for our 3 days here and was fantastic that he planned to get a way from crowds. Here is his suggested itinerary : First Day\u2022 Arrive Siem Reap at noon \u2013 Go to FCC Angkor to check-in\u2022 Tour at 3 pm \u2013 Angkor Thom and Ta Phrom temple. Second Day\u2022 Ta Promh at sunrise/early morning \u2013 pick up at 6:00am\u2022 Back to FCC Hotel for breakfast \u2022 Go to Angkor Wat at noon when all tour groups leave temple for lunch. Around 3 pm, visit Pre Rup and Preah Khan sunset tour on the way back. Third Day\u2022 Bayon \u2013 early sunrise and in-depth tour \u2013 pick up 6:00am\u2022 After Bayon tour \u2013 back to FCC\u2022 Leave hotel at 9:30 am going to Phnom Kulen National Park. Afternoon Bantey Srei on the way back. There are many good tour companies but Sam stood out because it was the little things he could do for us. He quickly worked out what sort of hotel we were looking for booked us in with no fuss. It was exactly what I would have chosen if I had time to find the place and it was within our budget. He knew we wanted to go out that evening, so drove us around the night spots and recommended a few places to get our bearings, then later that night we knew exactly which direction to head. So without his great service we probably would have missed out on the fantastic experiences (although very short) of Siem Reap and Angkor region. Thanks for your lovely service and had a good take care of us. We would definitely recommend Sam's service to our friends, families that planning to visit here."

He knew what time each temple was quietest and we entered Ankor Wat from the far gate to avoid the crush which made for a far more pleasant day. Sam's knowledge about the temples and history of the area was amazing. I assumed he had a history degree but he is just incredibly knowledgeable. He answered all my questions perfectly and in depth. What we really loved was Sam's humour. We are Kiwis and Sam learned English from a very funny Aussie so he had us in hysterics with his Antipodean sayings \"g'day myyte\" and \"sweet bro\". The tour was very reasonably priced and we would recommend this tour company to anyone touring Ankor Wat."

Right after that, he took us to a great place to have breakfast, at the side of the temple. He then took us to see Bayon and Ankor Tom, to then make a great stop at a local-family restaurant. We enjoyed both the place and the food!In the afternoon we finally visited Ta Prohm (famous for 's Tom Raider) and other small temples along the road. We returned to our hotel at around 5 pm. Long day!The second day, Sam recommended us some local attractions such us The War Musem and a local dancing show with buffet dinner. We enjoyed both activities and also took some time to walk through Siem Reap's streets.in a nutshell, we had a terrific experience thanks to Sam! He is a great guide, he knows a lot about temples' and Khmer history, he is well conected locally, and also a very nice person. I believe our experience would have not been as great as it was, had not been for Sam! You definitely can get the most out of your stay in Siem Reap if you decide to contact Sam. The alternative is taking one of those \"1 guide for every 20-30 people tours\" which may be slightly cheaper, but where you barely talk to the guide, do not get to visit so many temples (they are much slower!), and most importantly do not get to really familiarize with local culture and history. The couple of extra bucks are definitely worth it!"

After reading the good reviews at Trip Advisor of the services that Sam provides, I decided to send him an e-mail on Thursday night, 2 days before our desired departure to Seam Reap, via Bangkok airport. Next morning I got a reply from Sam with his ideas, plans, prices, everything very detailed. We got our visas online, which was easy and hassle free (great bc we did not have to wait in a long line at the airport to get them). Since Sam was already booked for that weekend, he offered us the services of Mr Thy and the sweetest driver ever, named Mr Chay. They were waiting for us at Seam Reap airport with a nice, air conditioned SUV. All the time, we felt like a king and queen. Mr Thy was so happy, knowlegeble and enthusiastic about showing all that was possible in the short period of time and gave us cold wet towels, water and stopped every place we requested, like on the side of the road to grab a coconut fruit, to take pictures of rice fields, water buffalos, etc. We ate at 3 good restaurants, always with the best seats in the house reserved for us! So, from Sat 9am til Sun 4pm, we could see Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, Ta Prohm (\"Tomb Rider\" temple) twice because we liked it so much, Banteay Srei and we did the boat trip to Tonle Sap. Mr Thy also took us to a budhist temple behind Angkor Wat where we could share few moments in their presence while they were having their meal: really amazing! Plus, punctuality, joy and lots of pictures at the best spots!! We now have an amazing, unforgettable photo album where we had lots of fun!! Highly recommended specially if you want to have photos taken by a \"pro\"!! PS: the sunrise at Angkor Wat is precious!!!Mr Thy and Mr Chay, thanks a lot!!!"

We only had two days in Siem Reap and we scheduled this guided tour only a few days beforehand and Sam was able to provide a great itinerary and was very professional and helpful from beginning to end. We saw everything we wanted to see in our limited time with a great mix of activities (we didn't JUST see temples all day every day). Sam provided comfortable transportation to all the sites and plenty of cold, bottled water between walking round in the extremely hot temperatures. Rani was knowledgeable about not only the temples and sites themselves but also about modern Cambodian history and even about local plants, and of course found us all the best photo opportunities. I also appreciated the way the trip was organized - we did a lot of walking a lot in very hot weather but everything was spaced out well with appropriate breaks in between (e.g. eating lunch at great little restaurants in the cool shade at the hottest part of the day), plus the air conditioned van was great."

This was fine but sometimes difficult to hear the guide and ment you had to wait for the rest of the group before you could move on.This time my boyfriend and I went at it alone and booked Sam as a local guide. Not only did Sam organise all of our airport transfers he recommended activities for us to do day and night. We got front row seats at the traditional dance show and when we had trouble with our camera it helped having a local who knew where to go to get the right parts. Touring the temples was much more enjoyable as we could go at our own pace and I learned much more. If Sam is not available ask for his friend Mr.Chen I think his name is. He was our guide aroung Angkor and made it a really entertaining day. Both spoke excellent english and had the advantage of all the local knowledge. A definate must do whilst in Siem Reap"

Of course, Sam came through with our request! Chet was an amazing tour guide \u2013 very enthusiastic and always upbeat despite the very warm weather. We never at all felt rushed during our tour. Chet told us he was a teacher before becoming a tour guide, so he definitely was very knowledgeable about the history of Cambodia and the Angkor area, and was always able to answer our questions with such great detail. Chet also seemed to know the Angkor area really well as he always knew where to take us so that we could take some amazing photos! Sam and Chet were extremely great people and very professional.

Although Sam could not actually take us to tour the temples themselves, he provided a great knowledge of all the temples and was able to answer any questions that we had. For lunch, Sam took us to a friends house for lunch where we were lucky enough to experience Amok. I am so glad that I ordered this here, as I tried it then in other restaurants in Siem Reap and it did not compare to the flavours that were tasted in Sams friends recipe. Absolutely delicious. Again we done more touring and then asked Sam to take us around Siem Reap. He again pointed out attractions. We also asked Sam if he could take us to a guest house - unfortunately we were staying at Frangipani Villa's and a friends sunglasses were stolen from our room - when we told Sam this, he took to 3 guest houses and at the 3rd option we were very happy. Sam was an extremely lovely, lovely person and I have no hesitations in recommending his tours.

Avoid visiting during the monsoon period in Sept/Oct as there are frequent rains and floods. The city was flooded in ankle high water during my stay. Siem Reap is a haven for pampering yourself witth massages & foot reflexology costing only USD$5/hr. Remember to always leave a minimum tip of US$1 as most of these eager staff rely on tips to make ends meet! Siem Reap may not be the most suitable place for young children.If you are planning a trip to Siem Reap then Sam Pho is definately the man to contact!"

I contacted several guides/drivers in the Siem Reap area using Trip Advisor as a resource, and eventually picked Sam. I liked the fact that his website lists the prices of the services, and the prices he quoted me in the email were consistent with what was on his website. He will help with all your travel needs while in Siem Reap, from Airport pickup, transportation to the temples, to going to spas and restaurants. He suggested we go to a restaurant with a buffet and a cultural show. We went and it was very enjoyable. The guide that Sam provided was named Rani, and he was also very good. He is a super nice guy with good English and he will tell you all you want to know about the temples and surrounding area, plus any other information about Cambodia that you might be curious about. Riding around with these guys was very interesting and relaxing. We never felt rushed or confused about things because of a lack of English on their part. Overall we had a great experience with Sam and Rani. Only thing I would change... We went on a boat ride through a fishing village and to Tonle Sap lake. The ride was really nice, having our own private boat and seeing life in this fascinating village and the lake. It was definitely worth it, but I told Sam he should let people know beforehand that the ride is $20 per person, and it's cash only. Just so people know to bring enough money... no ATM's around there! Also there is a point in the village where you can get off the motorboat and ride a small rowboat through the mangrove trees, but we weren't told about this till a minute or two before we got there, which I felt was a little late.Overall I'd say seeing the temples with Sam and Rani was one of our best experiences on our trip to SE Asia, having the private car, driver and guide was definitely worth the price, and meeting Sam and Rani was great."

Always on time, reliable and i must say price wise very good deal too.His english is good as well and so it is easy to ask him questions, hear some Cambodia history or just chat while driving.We are planning another trip to Siem Reap coming september and I definately going to use his services again! Thanks Sampho and see you in september again!!!"

Sam's knowledge of the sites we visited was excellent , his recommendations on local food to eat when we stopped for lunch were great and he always had a cold bottle of water ready for us before and after walking around each of the sites. Our trip will always be a memorable one thanks to Sam and we cannot recommend him enough to any traveller visiting Siam Reap."

We opted for an air conditioned car, as it was the hot season and we figured we'd appreciate a cool break between temples. Sam brought Rani as a guide. We followed a two day itinerary that Sam suggested, which included a variety of temples and Chong Kneas floating village. These two days were one of the highlights of our entire trip!My husband and I hardly ever hire guides, as a poor guide can really ruin a day. Sam and Rani made the two days in Siem Reap just perfect. Great temple information, safe driving, pleasant company...they took us to great places to eat lunch and Rani took time to show us great photo spots at each temple. My husband is a history buff and he peppered Rani with questions. Rani answered them all! We learned so much about Ankor Wat and Cambodia!The best thing about Sam and Rani's tour was that they never gave the impression that they were in a rush, or that they weren't enjoying themselves - we never felt like they were trying to get the tour over with. Rather, it felt like we were spending two long, good touring days with two friends. The price Sam quoted before the tour was exactly what was asked for at the end (this is not always the case in Cambodia!). In all respects, the experience these two provided to us was professional, friendly, interesting and overall, extremely pleasant. They are, simply put, two very likable people! Highly recommended."

He has a sound knowledge of the history of Cambodia. We were worried about getting vegetarian food but Sam made sure we had sumptuous meals - his wife personally cooked for us in his small and cozy restaurant!!!!. We were provided with cold mineral water and towels all the way. Sam is a very helpful person. Will surely recommend him to whoever wanting to visit Seam Reap.Visu & Kamala & kids"

My boyfriend and i went to siem reap recently for vacation and we decided to get a private driver and make our own itinerary instead of the packaged tour that hotels or agencies often offer -- this was the best decision we made! We decided to get a private driver and got sam's info in TA. After a few emails, we settled our itinerary for 3 1/2 days. Sam responded quickly to our queries and since we pulled out the itinerary from the internet, he gladly helped us adjust our itinerary to make sure we cover all the must see plAces in siem reap. Sam is really the best driver that you can have in siem reap (as reflected in other ta reviews)- he arrives on time every morning, he is very knowledgeable re his country's history, religion and everything else you want to know about the temples and cambodia, in general (its like driver and tour guide in one!) , a good conversationalist and a humble person. He wont be like the other drivers who can be annoying when they insist on taking you wherever just to make more money out of you. Before he drops us off in each temple, he would always provide us with some background to get us started and would gladly answer our questions if we have one. He also helped us buy a guidebook which was much used during our trip. We enjoyed taking our own sweet time in whatever temple we fancied and at some points we even stop for longer than usual either to enjoy the view or simply because we got too tired -- a luxury you wont have if you are with a tour guide who tends to rush you so you can finish on time for the day. And of course, after tiring walks and climbs in the temples, Sam will be ready with bottles of mineral water to quench your thrist -- for free, to top it offAfter each day, we would always ask sam to drop as off in the old market area for dinner and would ask his recommendations for restaurants. All of his recommendations turned out to be our best dinners during our vcation. He took us to khmer kitchen where we ended having 3 meals in total, he recommended blue pumpkin where we had ice cream almost every day. he also gave us tips on how to haggle in the market and the best place to buy certain stuff.As ive said sam us really capable ofMaking your stay in siem reap enjoyable and relaxig. If we ever go back to siem reap, we will definitely hook up with him again."

Sam (Driver) and Rani (Angkor Wat Guide) made our short trip (only 2 days-wished we had spent at least 1 week there) to Siem Reap one of the best experiences we have had. You must get a Guide like Rani to go with you through Angkor Wat. His knowledge of his Country's history and the Ankgor Wat sites was exceptional. We would never have found half the information if we had gone with a group tour. The one to one service is what you need. He showed us all the great spots to have photos and took many photos of my Husband & I together. When visiting Angkor Wat you must wear clothing to cover your shoulders and down to to your knees or you will not be allowed to visit some sites. We saw many people not being allowed to visit the sites but Sam & Rani had already prepared us for this. At Angkor Wat you are able to climb some very steap stairs to experience another part of the site. It was very high and as I am extremely scared of heights I was very worried. Rani made sure at all times I was looked after. The next day Sam took us to the Floating Village and to an Orphanage to drop off books and stationery supplies. If you go to Siem Reap take school supplies, kids clothing, toothbrushes, toothpaste or buy rice when you are there to give to the Orphanage. It was so wonderful seeing the kids smiles when we gave them our gifts and it was very hard leaving them. Sam got us a front row seat at a cultural show, waited whilst I did some shopping and dropped us off at the airport. Both Sam & Rani went out of their way to make our short holiday very memorable, we even paid them more than double their fee because we were so happy!!! I have no hesitation in recommending Sam & Rani."

(Half day $20) We did that the next day and this was very good to see the locals and the conditions that they live under. They are very poor and the children do not have coloured pencils or books. We did take some coloured pencils for which they were grateful, so if you intend to do something similar take some coloured pencils also toothbrushes (from hotel) or anything that will help these people.Overall I recommend Sam and his tours, he is fairly easy to understand and is a good person and guide. His Camry is well looked after and the airconditioning works well."

He was always on time and his knowledge of Siem Reap and all of it's attractions made our visit extremely memorable. We visited the temples of Angkor Thom, Bayon, Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm and Banteay Srei. In addition Sam took us to Kompong Phhluk an amazing stilt village adjacent to Lake Tonle Sap that becomes a floating village in the wet season. This and Angkor Wat at sunrise were certainly among the highlights of this amazing tour provided by Sam. Sam introduced us to some Khmer culture by taking us to an extremely colourful and entertaining Apsara dance and dinner and heightened our experience by explaining all of the stories behind the dances to us.While we were in Siem Reap we were at times unwell following a trip to Vietnam and Sam was extremely understanding of the limitations this placed on us and made adjustments to our itineraries to accommodate our needs. Sam was at all times providing us with an insight in to his country that was extremely well informed and passionate.We would unreservedly recommend Sam to anyone planning a trip to Siem Reap and would always go to him first when we return ourselves.John and Carolyn, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia"

We have just come back from a 17 day tour of South East Asia, of which we spent 3 nights at Siem Reap visiting the temples at Angkor Wat. Thanks to Tripadvisor we found out about Sam (Sampho) and contacted him before our trip to arrange an itinerary for us. He was very quick in his response and suggested a great itinerary.He collected us from the bus depot mid afternoon on our first day and took us to our Hotel, to check in and have a rest for an hour. He then collected us and took us to the Tonle Sap Lake, explaining along the way about the countryside and the Cambodian way of life. We enjoyed our time here, visiting the floating village and luckily we were there at sunset, which was beautiful.The next morning Sam collected us and we went to the Bayon and Ta Phrom temples in the morning, then after lunch, which we ate at his family home/restaurant (lovely food) we visited Angkor Wat. We had a major downpour of rain when we were at the top of Angkor Wat, which made the countryside look mystical. We then headed to Phnom Bakheng to see the sunset, but unfortunately because of the rain it was very cloudy/misty so there wasn't really much to see.The next morning Sam picked us up at 5.30 and we drove to Angkor Wat to watch the sunrise, this was a great experience and one not to be missed. We decided to continue with the tour rather than go back to our hotel for a rest. We were glad we did this as it meant we stayed ahead of the tour groups and the heat was easier to cope with. Sam then drove us to Pre Rup, then onto Bantey Srei and Ta Som (probably my favourite temple), then onto Preah Neak Poan and finally Preah Khan. We arrived back at our hotel around 1pm and so we had a bit of R & R.The next morning Sam drove us to the airport and we headed off to Malaysia. I can not praise Sam highly enough, he is very friendly, courteous, knowledgable and always prompt. Our trip to this part of the world was definitely enhanced by using his service, I would certainly recommend him to anyone who was thinking of visiting this amazing place."

From the very 1st contact by e mail Sam was efficient, courteous, organising our 3 days around exactly what we wanted to do. Sam was our driver, his brother in law also travelled with us as our Angkor guide, and between the 2 of them we learned so much, not only about Angkor Wat and the other temples but also about local life and customs. Both Sam and his brother in law were always smiling, helpful, fun to be with. As well as the temples, we visited Tonle Sap lake and its floating village one day. A definite highlight.For lunch Sam brought us to eat in his new wife's restaurant, Sampho's Khmer Kitchen, where we ate simple, delicious, fresh Khmer food in a peaceful setting in a local village. If you want to eat real Khmer food in a real Cambodian village, then this is the place for you.I cannot recommend Sam and his services highly enough."

He had everything arranged for me, including a pickup from the airport, laundry, daily driving, and a great tour guide (Phon). Sam is always on time and very reliable. He's responsive to e-mail and helped me plan an itinerary in Siem Reap/Angkor before I arrived. His recommended guide was very knowledgeable and we ended up having great conversations versus simple regurgitation from Wikipedia. I was able to really learn about Angkor as well as Cambodia and the Cambodian people.I highly recommend Sam to anyone visiting Siem Reap. He will allow you to fully enjoy your trip and focus on the great sights versus any logistics."

We decided to book through Sam after reading all of the positive reviews. We couldn't have asked for a better experience! Here are highlights:- Sam promptly responded to our many inquiries in advance of our arrival. He took care of all hotel arrangements, an excellent local tour guide, etc. No payment for his service, the tour guide, or hotel was required until the end of the trip.- He was always on-time -- at the airport, our hotel, at the sites.- He arranged for a thoughtful itinerary to meet our limited schedule and points of interest. - We're both foodies, and the local lunches he brought us to were highlights of our entire trip to SE Asia. Off the tourist trail, simple, fresh, and delicious. Seriously, I'm still dreaming about the curry. I also decided I wanted to eat some local bugs, and Sam drove us out of the way to find a perfect local market.- My friend decided to change her flight and stay an extra day. Again, he happily drove us out of the way to the travel agency and promptly made the other necessary arrangements. As two females in our late 20s, I was initially reluctant to go to Siem Reap without a larger group. However, Sam made the trip a safe and unforgettable experience. It was truly a pleasure to meet him, and we continue to be friends through Facebook. His pride in his work and country are evident and admirable.- DawnNew York, New York"

I first learned of Sam through TripAdvisor.com, and retained his services when I went backpacking in Cambodia / Siem Reap last June. He picked me up from the airport and also drove me to and from Angkor Wat for the four days that I was visiting the archaeological site. He was on-time, patient and knowledgeable. Although I had a self-guided tour book (which I recommend that you purchase, either before or during your trip), it was nice to hear his personal commentary on archaeological sites.Also, as a single traveler, I enjoyed his companionship -- through my many conversations with Sam, I felt that I learned a great deal about Cambodia's culture, education systems and economy. It's a country incredibly rich in history, and it's pretty amazing how an empire that was once as grand as the Khmers (as can be seen through the Angkor Wat site) has changed so drastically over the centuries. Sam also has an excellent sense of humor and grasp of Western culture and language -- of course, given Sam's general knowledge of the world along with his extensive clientele from English-speaking countries, this probably shouldn't be too much of a surprise.I did not hire any other tuk-tuk drivers so I have no means of comparing Sam to anyone else. However, based on my personal experience with Sam, I would recommend his services unequivocally.Best,Eric"

I am so grateful that a friend who had already traveled to Cambodia gave me the contact of Angkor Wat Tours. I am an American who has not traveled many places outside of my own country, so my companion and I were a little nervous. Our worries vanished when we saw our driver, Sam, waiting for us with a friendly smile at the Siem Riep Airport with a sign adorning our names. Our driver was extremely knowledgeable, but never pushy or aggressive. We had a few ideas about what where we wanted to go, and he accommodated us happily. He also filled in the blanks with his own ideas. We loved riding in the Tuk Tuk, so he mostly drove us around this way. However, if we would have preferred a car, he would have obliged. Sam was always waiting for us at the meeting times we set. We were never left wondering, \"Where is our driver?\" We were two young girls, but we felt extremely safe the entire time. Also, I had an injured leg, so i was unable to visit a lot of the temples, but Sam helped us choose the three best for us. (We went to Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm- our favorite-, and Bayon) Visiting Cambodia was such an eye-opening experience. My friend and I felt like we were on a movie set! This trip was nearly a year ago, but I still think about it all the time. I can't wait to return someday. The people were so wonderful and welcoming. I know that main reason our trip was so carefree was because of the great service of Angkor Wat Tours!"

Sam was friendly, fun and informative and was always willing to have a great chat and discussion. I was amazed at how excellent Sam\u2019s English skills were and his own personal knowledge about Siem Reap, Cambodian culture and the temples.Sam\u2019s flexibility and availability was greatly appreciated on our trip. He was eagerly waiting in our hotel lobby to take us to watch the sunrise over Angkor Wat at 5am and organised front row seats for us at a Cambodian Apsara Cultural night and dinner (among many other things!).We had organised Sam to drive us to Phnom Penh (6 hour drive) on our last day and unexpectedly I fell very ill and needed to go to the local hospital. Despite Sam\u2019s uncle being in the car to get a lift with us to Phnom Penh, Sam was happy to drop everything and drive us to the hospital. He waited around till we left the hospital and was very flexible with what ever we needed to do as a result of my illness. Despite being sick, Sam safely and comfortably drove us the 5 and a half hours to Phnom Penh from Siem Reap in a very comfortable air conditioned van. Once Sam\u2019s service to us as a driver had finished; he was more than happy to give recommendations and organise a driver for Phnom Penh for us.If you are visiting Siem Reap, particularly for the first time, there is no better driver than Sam. We now consider Sam a great friend and are looking forward to visiting him in Cambodia again soon.Regards,Sarah and Tim (Sydney, Australia)"

We booked a 2-day tour with Angkor Wat Driver Private Tours online. Mr Chimm and Mr Savoern were both very punctual (arrived at our hotel prior to scheduled meeting time) and took us to major temples around Angkor Wat site. They were both very friendly and explained to us with patience about the history and details at each site and each bas-relief. It might be a standard script from the Cambodian Government Tourism Board, but very impressed with Mr Savoern's handling in English. Only downside is we struggled to remember king's and Hindu/Buddhist gods name, but it is our fault for not doing any prior homework. Despite that, we got the basic history background about the Khmer, and its warfare with Champa and Siam. Compared to other guided tours we have taken (for example, Chichen Itza outside of Cancun), Mr. Savoern was soooooo eager in helping you taking pictures, we didn't even have to ask, he offered to take pics voluntarily at many sites and took us to several \"hidden\" photo spot we otherwise couldn't notice.After all, depend on how savvy and how eager you are with historical ruins, but if you are like us, only paying a tribute to such a historic site to check off a to-do list and is not interested enough to do your own homework, We highly recommend hire a private tour guide, and 2-day is pretty much enough, as very likely someone from your group will suffer from temple exhaustion."

The email communication was brilliant and Mr. Seiha was happy to accommodate our personal choices, as well as providing suggestions for our tour. We were picked up from our hotel, and when I asked Mr. Seiha if we could stop at a money exchange before we headed to Angkor Wat he was more than happy to oblige; nothing was too much trouble. We visited Banteay Srey (an additional $10 for fuel as it is a distance, but worth it) and Ta Prohm (The absolute highlight for me!) and then had a traditional Khmer lunch at a great little outdoor restaurant in Angkor Thom. After lunch, we headed to the Bayon temple and Angkor Wat. Each time we returned to the vehicle, a clean and well-maintained Honda CRV, Mr. Seiha had an icy-cold bottle of water waiting for us, which was much appreciated. Our last stop was to the war museum before we were dropped back at our hotel late in the afternoon. This tour was an absolute highlight of our trip to Cambodia and Mr. Seiha made it an informative, stress-free and comfortable day for us. Highly recommend!"

He has years of experience and is extremely knowledgeable in the entire area. This time, I even did a trip with him to Koh Ker and Beng Mealea, two temples far out from the crowds of tourists and much less \"manicured\". Beng Mealea was like visiting a lost city in the jungle. I'm glad I did it this time. If you haven't been to Angkor Wat before, Seiha can suggest an itinerary that will take you to all the best sites and time it for you to miss most of the tourist crush. He knows which sites are busy at any time of day. He was very helpful in my planning. I'm a photographer and I came this time with some specific goals. If you've been to Angkor Wat before, all you need to do is tell Seiha where you want to go and he will get you there and wait patiently for you.I highly recommend Seiha and next time I return I will be sure to book him again."

Regardless, Seiha was gracious enough to let us bow out of eating there. So plus points for that.All in all, it was a very pleasant experience!"

Having just finished our tour with Seiha and our guide for the day Sim we cannot speak highly enough of these 2, picked us up on time, had an endless supply of ice cold water and a nice cold air conditioned car waiting after visiting each temple.Sim was very knowledgeable about everything and took the time to make sure we understood what we were looking at. Even showing us the best photo spots the whole way through.If your going to angkor wat, use these guys and you won't be disappointed."

My friend and I contacted Tep Nat by email (tep_nat_2007@yahoo.com) before we left Australia, based upon an excellent referral from a teacher I met on a flight home from Vietnam a couple of years ago. He couldn't speak highly enough of Tep Nat and we were not disappointed, either. While the two day tour was more expensive than others I have read about, Tep Nat's knowledge of the area, which temples to see at what time to avoid the crowds, and his passion for the rich history of his country made for two very memorable days. He also engaged a driver with an a/c 4WD, which certainly made it easier to get around - three temples on the first day, and four days on the second - in the extreme heat that is encountered in May.We began with sunrise at Angkor Wat - Tep Nat took us to great spots to watch it and take photos from. We walked a different way around the site to pretty much everyone else and were able to take loads of photos without other people in them as a result. Tep Nat patiently explained the architecture, the stories behind the murals and any other topic we were interested in. We were second in line to go up to level two - again, thanks to our guide.After spending a couple of hours at Angkor Wat, we drove to Bayon - my favourite. No crowds, as they were all visiting Ta Prohm, or other temples. Finally, Ta Prohm, another interesting and amazing place, with tree roots sprawling through the ruins. Tep Nat, my friend and I were the only people at Pre Rup at sunrise the following morning - a very special feeling. I loved the colours at our second temple for the day, Banteay Srei - again, we were by ourselves for around twenty minutes, before another couple of people arrived. The pink tones and the intricate carvings were just amazing.Our final two temples, Ta Som and Preah Khan, were also fantastic in their own way. It was great to see such a variety, but also recognise similarities in each of them, thanks to what we learned from our guide.I don't think we could have seen or learned so much without Tep Net and our driver - it was just way too hot, and had we been in amongst the throngs of other tourists, it would have been even hotter!Angkor Wat archaeological park is a very special place and a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We wanted to do it right, and by visiting the temples with Tep Nat I'm sure we got the most out of our days as possible. I certainly won't ever forget it."

His 2 day service was perfect for our needs, he arrived on time, made allowances in the itinerary for changes and gave us plenty time to wander round the temples at our own pace. An older member of our party found the heat and vastness of the temples too much at times and Mr Seiha suggested several temple which have less climbing. I'm glad we had a small compass too... If you arrive at the South entrance and are being collected at the West exit... it's very easy to lose your bearings. But Mr Seiha was always there waiting patiently for us with a cool car and lots of water. He dropped us at a nice restaurant for lunch where we had some tasty Khmer dishes. So I would not hesitate to recommend Mr Seiha if you need a friendly, reliable driver on your trip."

It was a great experience as Seiha and Sim were able to provide us our end to end experience on our tight timelines. Seiha was able to suggest a personal itinerary that fit our needs, and on the day of were able to read us on what we wanted to see and do. The price was quite reasonable for a personal tour guide and driver, but did not feel like a budget service. They were courteous and professional throughout, and very knowledgeable of both Angkor Wat grounds but also the history. We started the day at 5am, and did not feel rushed as the day wore on. One advice I'd suggest is if you're insistent on seeing the entire grounds, don't try and see it in one day. For a couple of reasons. First, it's really hot here and there's little reprieve from the heat. Second, it's a lot of square kilometres to walk for even the most able bodies - especially with the stairs. (Seiha advised us to do two days but we didn't have this luxury) Thank you Seiha and Sim."

Below are the highlights of our trip with him as our Tuk Tuk guide:1. From the very beginning while booking, Mr. Seiha is prompt with his replies.2. The offer given to us was a bargain compared to other tuk tuk guides.3. Mr. Lee was never late. He's always in front of our hotel 10-15 minutes before call time.4. We originally have an itinerary in mind but was not followed - and we're glad that it went that way because Mr. Lee\u2019s itinerary was way better. Following his itinerary, we were able to visit everything stress-free!5. Mr. Lee is a man of few words but fluent in English. This is a plus because we get annoyed by people who talks too much especially when we\u2019re tired. He isn't a snob, a bit shy but really friendly when conversing.6. Every after temple visit, Mr. Lee is always ready to hand you a bottle of cold water.7. It was drizzling when we visited Siem Reap and good thing Mr. Lee has an umbrella ready.8. In terms of driving, he drives a bit faster compared to the others. Fast, but safe.9. Mr. Lee always abides with our requests. He lets us rest for a few minutes after each temple visit.10. During our Angkor Thom tour, he brought us to his restaurant-owner friend. We got a good discount and the food was really good. It is in stall #30-31.11. He takes good care of our stuff. Most of the time I leave my bag in his tuk tuk and I am confident he looks after it.12. He allowed us to drop by the NTC office to book a bus going to Bangkok without additional cost."

We were lucky to meet Cheak, a professional tour guide who speaks fluent english, and knows the in depth history of Cambodia in general, and of the temples very well. He made the tour interesting, and entertaining, he knows where to skip long lines, and as well as great angles and spots for photo taking! Cheak also went out of his way and invited me to his village for a typical Cambodian Barbecue, as well as play in a soccer match with his friends! If you want to contact Cheak please do, I strongly recommend him as a tour guide, and also as a friend!

I arranged with Mr Chhim to take us around for a full day tour with Mr Sokphan as our guide. The arranged tour was to visit a few temples on the same day. It was horribly hot, that our shirts were soaked with sweat while touring the temples. Good thing Mr Chhim prepared cold bottled water for us to take each time we stopped at a temple. He had cold towel ready also in his cooler box at the back of the car. We wanted unscheduled half day tour the next day and both Mr Chhim and Mr Sokphan recommended us to visit the stilt houses village i/o floating village. It was dry season and floating village is not exactly floating around that time. We could be disappointed if we went there and didn't see what was expected. Overall, had a good trip. Finally get to see Angkor Wat and learned of it's amazing history. Thank you Mr Chhim and Mr Sokphan for a wonderful but short trip."

I had been stationed at Nakhom Phanom, Thailand for a year in 1974 and 1975. One of my responsibilities was to analyze satellite photos of Southeast Asia and Tonle Sap was a prominent feature of my locating the satellite photos. I had always wanted to see it and experience its transition from a small lake to the largest lake in Southeast Asia. It was a great experience getting on a boat in a canal and going out into the lake. We then followed Praim's well orchestrated plan of taking in some of the first temples and moving to the later temples. We took in two temples after Tonle Sap and then the next day off to Angkor Wat and the later temples. The next day, Praim was again right on in his timing. We went to Angkor Wat early in the morning and then left for Ta Proehm and Angkor Thom because there was no crowd there early. This was again excellent timing by our guide. We arrived back at Angkor Wat when everyone else who had been there all morning were leaving to eat lunch. We had some ice cream at Angkor Caf\u00e9 right across from the Rainbow Bridge entrance to Angkor Wat. It had been recommended to us and was very good and revived us for going through Angkor Wat for an hour or so. The main educational attraction at Angkor Wat is the covered terrace that extends all around Angkor Wat. This terrace and gallery of carved sandstone was restored by the Germans and they did a marvelous job of restoring both the terrace and the carvings. The roof over the terrace and carvings had collapsed, so it is all done and very well exposes the artistry and uniqueness of Angkor Wat. The terrace/gallery contains sandstone carvings of the Hindu mythology stories and Praim could explain all of them. The carvings are extremely intricate and are very long and drawn out. Praim did a great job of giving us the general gist of the story telling. On our last day, we went to Preah Khan and to Banteay Srey temples which are further out from the Siem Reap. We got to see lots of countryside and local life, which my wife loves to take photos of and experience how people live. Praim is very proud of his country and his heritage. We asked lots of questions about politics, life in Cambodia, and general questions about how they eat and how they play. He was a fount of information. He gets our top ratings."

He's friendly, always arrive on time, very patient, he talks to us about the temples and Cambodia culture along the way, and the ice cold water supply was another bonus.

Siem Reap was such fun during the evenings and nights and the temples were astounding during the day. What made this trip possible for me was Seiha. I live in Singapore and was quite prepared for the heat but nothing like what I had to experience. We had contacted Seiha 2 days before our arrival and he came promptly the evening we landed to plan our agenda for the next 2 days. He was there at 4.30 AM for the sunrise shoot at Angkor Wat and then took us around to Angkor Thom, Ta Prohm, Banteay Srei, etc over 2 days. What made the difference was he almost always dropped us off at the entrances with less people and we exited through the gates where most of the people were coming in. So that made a big difference. But he was simply amazing in the way he was ready with the car and the aircon switched on and his never ending supply of cold water bottles and icy facial wipes. He's quite the entertaining guy, funny and spoke pretty good English. Took us to some nice places to satisfy us gastronomically and he was quite knowledgeable about the the history of Angkor. I would definitely go back to Siem Reap and I wouldn't think of anyone else but Seiha. Very honest guy and a safe driver and very accomodating and flexible to your requests. No hassles at all! His charges were very reasonable considering he was available for us with an aircon car, water and all through the day! Thanks to him, I was able to complete the trip in the scorching heat."

He would often drop us at what seemed to be the quieter entrance to a temple and then pick us up on the other side were it was busier. This worked well and made our time there more enjoyable.

We booked Mr. Seiha on March 18 and 19, 2013 to drive us around Siem Reap: the various temples, the National Museum, restaurants, old market, Pub St., 5:30 a.m. sunrise watching, etc. etc. All this in his air conditioned Toyota Camry car for only $20 a day. Though the early sunrise cost us another $5, Mr. Seiha provided us free cooled bottled drinking water for 2 days and some cool paper towels. Another freebie we got from Mr. Seiha: transfer from the airport to Casa Angkor Hotel. That was really nice because we arrived in Siem Reap in the evening. Mr. Seiha also booked for us a dinner buffet with the Apsara dance show at the Mondial Restaurant ($12 per person) near our hotel. He also recommended and booked a Mr. Lisang as our tour guide for a day for only $25. Mr. Seiha was friendly but never pushy. He is very good natured.. We laughed a lot exchanging pleasantries about our respective countries, about our English accents and pronunciation. Though Mr. Seiha said he was not yet a licensed tour guide, he knows a lot about his country and ably answered all our questions on the history of Cambodia. Mr. Seiha also did not mind sometimes acting as our photographer! And Mr. Seiha, we should have listened to you when you said the $125 per person hot air balloon ride was too expensive! We all regretted taking that balloon ride! It was not worth the cost because we never got near or even got a glimpse of the Angkor Wat complex as we expected!"

To tell you the truth, since there were always a lot of tourists and cars in front of each temples, it wouldn't be easy for you to find your driver after you visited the site. However, Seiha and his brother always could find us before we even had a clew of which direction we should look at. That really saved a lot of our time.

A couple of considerations for anyone on a first trip to the area. First of all you need to decide whether you want to book someone ahead of time or do it once you are there. My thought process was that despite the fact that I was aware that there were plenty of options I rather reserve it in advance in order to not only have certainty but be able to hit the ground running once I arrived \u2013 through emails was able to get a feeling of his English; had discussed ahead of time the itinerary so was able to start right away with it; knew exactly the cost; and if the reviews were reasonably accurate knew what to expect. For all these reasons I don\u2019t see any advantage of not reserving your driver in advance and on the contrary, will highly recommend it since it only works to your advantage.Second consideration I struggled with, was Tuk-Tuk vs car. Being the only difference a cost of $20 (nearby temples) vs. $10/$12 I opted for the car and again will recommend it to everyone. Although Tuk Tuk are cheaper and you get somehow a more \u201clocal flavor\u201d the car had several advantages that makes it in my view a much better option. To name a few: travel comfort, A/C, able to leave securely behind purchases while touring temples, occasionally it can get very unpleasant to ride on an open vehicle due to smog, rain and dust from dirt roads; better use of time; etc. On longer trips such as Tonle Sap which has a stretch of dirt road or Beng Mealea which is about an hour ride, a car is very welcomed.Having said that I will highly recommend to anyone to book in advance a car and in that respect can highly recommend Seiha (I emailed several other drivers recommended in different forums in order to choose one) . He is a very proud Siem Reap native who speaks good English, price is very reasonable, and always tried to do a little more to make sure you enjoyed your trip (keeps free cold water in the car which is a blessing after long walks, has good knowledge of the history of the sites which adds color to trip, etc). Nonetheless, what I think sets him apart is the fact that he is extremely conscious on the importance of providing a good service.On days that we covered the intended itinerary in less time than expected rather than calling it for the day he was quick making suggestions of additional sites/things that could be done; to make better use of the time he recommended local restaurants that where in the way to freshen up and try local dishes; last day I tried to squeeze a couple of last minute stops before going to the airport and he had not problem; and overall, he was extremely flexible to accommodate the itinerary to what I wanted as a good driver should do. Overall, he was of great help and will not hesitate to use him again on a future trip."

Seiha also has a very nice personality and sense of humor. Along with his ever-present supplies of cold drinks and refresher towels, this is all you could ask for in a driver!

The air conditioning is strong and very welcome after an hour or more spent in the boiling and humid outside. In fact, Seiha goes even further by offering his patrons complimentary ice cold water and cold towels at each stop.If you are coming to Angkor Wat / Siem Reap and need a driver, Seiha is the guy for you.

I went without any prior planning, and happened to get Mr Seiha's number from a fellow tourist in my hotel. Mr Seiha personally catered my needs within 12 hours of my request. My super packed 2days agenda was excellently fulfilled by him and his fellow English speaking tourist guide, Mr Khim who was very knowledgeable, equipped with much experience and provided an excellent service.Both of them have catered to our last minute request of going to the Phnom Kulen which was a further drive and still managed to complete our remaining visits.Mr Seiha\u2019s charges are very reasonable and his service is very reliable. He is punctual, suggestive and knowledgeable, all of which we need from a tour guide. For all, please be informed on the type of temples you would like to visit apart from Angkor Wat. Some of the structures are the same hence you may not notice much difference. Recommended temples are, Ta Prom, Banteay Srei, Bakong, Bayon and Angkor Thom. Visiting floating village in Tonle Sap lake is not recommended at all as there is nothing much to see in the village, and you will also be scammed with beggars in the middle of the lake. Dinner and drinks in Pub Street is recommended. Please visit Red Piano (frequented by Angelina Jolie) and Cambodian Soup. Value for money and tasty food. Shopping in Night Market and Old Market - please bargain as you can them with 80% off.Visiting in month of May results to a very hot and humid weather, and it\u2019s a low peak season. You may be lucky to get a 5 star hotel in high discount. Travel guides will be very competitive in their pricing too. Borei Angkor Resort and Spa is a 5 star hotel that provides excellent service, great venue and good restaurants. High class hospitality and excellent experience. Well recommended. Lastly, having a personal driver and tour guide is the recommended option for those who are visiting for a short trip and would not like to exhaust themselves. You can completely complete all the key visits and still have room for relaxation!Siem Reap is a must visit place for those whom appreciate architecture and history!"

He speaks excellent English, is very knowledgeable as well as UNDERSTANDING different cultures and nationalities.... the non tangible items you look for when travelling. Sieha Chhim had an excellent insight into the hotels, Guesthouse and eateries (whats good bad and indifferent) and nothing was too much of a hassle. We all like to have a sound local knowledge when travelling and i felt very comfortable with Mr.Seiha Chhim and the manner which he familiarised me with Siem Reap on both occasions.

Another day we walked to the village Rolos (not a big distance from Siam Reap) Cambodian village Authentic, it was fascinating to see the Cambodians in their house wooden and straw (some tin and some Just a stone building), people may be poor in terms of the Western world, but welcoming And contented.From there we sailed in a boat along the canals in Komfong Fluke, to Floating villages, built on high wooden beams (fearing the rise of the water After torrents of rain), then a very big lake - Tonle Sap.Same day Also we managed to reach the Goebel Caspian ,POI and sacred to Buddhists, with a waterfall Water and interesting stone knapping, all within a jungle, walking in the preserve Jungle is a fascinating experience. Another day we drove northeast to the Phnom Golan, to a number of fascinating sites Reservation, we walked along the creek beautiful and abundant water flows eventually into the waterfall Height of 20 meters, and the bottom number is good for swimming pools.

Another day, We Visit in Siem Reap itself and it has nothing to be seen, relatively shopping Cheap. We looked for a way to go in Cambodia, because renting vehicles is virtually Possible,We went to 'Travel' and there we saw an article by travelers who toured Cambodia And used the services of a man named chhim seiha because the matter was quick, I sent him an email right Just before the flight from Bangkok to Siem Reap. About two hours later we were at the airport in Siem Reap, and once we emerged from the airport, waiting for us seiha with a big sign with our names in English. For 5-4 days, he accompanied us from morning to night, a pleasant man, know Good English, knows a lot about Cambodia and its history, the bureaucracy there, And how should go and what to see, and always with patience and happiness. The prices we paid were very good in relation to compensation received. Our conclusion was that his selection as an option to traffic and high power, the number of days Small, was excellent.

Truly a good choice to hire his services in Angkor."

Since I only had a very short time to visit Angkor before ending my trip in Asia, I decided to organize a rapid tour of the area with a very kind and helpful driver I found on internet:Chhim Seiha. He picked me up at the airport, took me with his car and all my belongings straight to see sunset at Phnom Bakeng before dropping me off at the hotel. Next morning at 04am, right on time, there he was in the hotel lobby ready and in a good mood to spend the whole day with me driving from sunrise at Angkor Wat, then breakfast nearby, then from one temple to another with lunch in between and by the end of the afternoon, I had been able to see most of what I really wanted to see. Then, back to the airport where, while waiting for my flight, I realized Seiha had helped me spend an awsome stay in one of the most beautiful places I had ever visited. Again Seiha, thank you very much and I have already recomended you to several people who need an honest and experienced driver to travel safely without wasting time and money. Daniel"

We don't need a tour, becos u can get a guidebook in siem reap easily and cheaply. The trick is definitely getting a reliable driver, as time management is really an essence . Becos in summer it is not possible to travel between 12-2 pm. So to see as much as possible using our 3 day pass, we need to wake up early. I booked a vehicle of 5 from the internet for Chhim thru internet, by sending him my tentative plan(of course i put almost everything on list, even the exotic Beng Malea (3-4 hours) and the 4 am sunrise in Angknor Wat ). We agreed on the price (which is afforable around 40 US per day, he needs to charge us extra becos Beng Malea is far away and we start off very early <--point that i feel obliged to pay more). We started our densely packed trip starting from 3 am or 4 am in the morning and ends at 6-7 at night.. On the date of the arrival, Chhim's car surprised us all - a Mercedes Benz 7 ppl van. The van was comfy and save the day on the bumpy road to Beng Malea. The driver always arrived punctual. My last visit, the driver last time, always got late and we set off in 9am, which missed alot of interesting place, and the place were so crowded we got there. This time, we were the first 5 visitors arriving Bayon !! The driver was nice, he never sells us to any place to eat or to buy. Or to insists us on some pre-made tour (maybe he can't speaks english well.)..We had an enjoyable holiday and i strongly recommend Chhim's service to anyone who wishes to explore Angkor."

Ask the boys in for a cool drink please. Next day Temple again in the morning, then a stop at Koh Ker afterwards then return to Siem Reap. Reason is that it can be fog-bound in the mornings so give yourself two chances.We also hired Sothea for 4 days driving around the Angkor Wat temple area ($US35/day) and to Kbal Spean plus temples ($US70). really pleasant man and very helpful.

I told him I needed a hotel/guesthouse in a certain price range, transportation to Thailand in the coming days, and that I'd like to see Angkor Wat through him. Afterward, we went from the bus station to an agency to book a ticket, to a hotel that was perfectly located and within my budget, for no charge! (I tipped, of course). He was EARLY the next day to see Angkor Wat, which I was impressed with. His spoken English and thorough knowledge on AW is remarkable.

Yes they'll be amazed at what they've seen, but they will have missed so much more. The best advise I can give is email Navuth, and look at what other options exist. This year Navuth organised a car, and we made the trek out to Preah Vihear on the Thai/Cambodia border, and whilst it costs more it was worth every cent! The same can be said of Kompong Khleang fishing village, and Beng Mealea temple both of which get much less tourist pressure due to being outside Tuk Tuk range. Do yourself a favour and visit these places, they are truly spectacular.So what keeps me coming back, and using Navuth's services. Simple, excellent customer service. Your safety, comfort, and enjoyment are Navuth's priority. This year I was hindered by my health, and had my sister visiting with me on her first overseas trip.

            "review": "A pride of Cambodia. My boyfriend and I traveled to Siem Reap via Mekong Express bus and Navuth approached us like an ordinary tuk tuk driver. He brought us to our hotel (Nikkivinsi Boutique Villa) near the Angkor Wat Complex and when the tuk tuk came to a complete halt, he told us that he offers tours and we can contact him the next day for a whole day tour at Angkor Wat. At first I was hesitant because we might end up getting scammed or ripped off. But instinct tells me to listen to him and what he has to offer. I asked him if it is still possible to start the tour that day and go to the farther and less popular temples within the Angkor Wat Complex given that it was already past 3pm and the complex closes at 6pm. He told us it is still possible but we have to hurry and we still have to buy one day pass for that. So I trusted my instinct and went with the plan. We bought the 3-day pass at $40 since we still intend to go back the next day (there is no 2-day pass available). That split second decision of starting the tour that day was by far the best impulsive decision I made. The extra $20 we spent for just 2 and a half hours inside the complex was so worth it. Navuth made it worth it for us. He brought us to Preah Khan and nearby temples and gave us time frame and instructions so we could fully maximize our time. After he brought us at Pre Rup to catch the sunset. Pre Rup has a stunning sunset view. It really is a must see.Without hesitation this time, we contracted him for the tour the next day to go to the popular temples (Angkor Wat, Bayon Temple, Ta Prohm etc.). Needless to say, we had an awesome two-day tour with him. He is not just an ordinary driver/guide who drives tourists around for the sake of making a living. He is a guy with passion. He makes sure that his clients have a memorable trip. Our short trip in Siem Reap became very memorable and worth it because of him. He is honest, punctual, informative and he also suggests ways on how to maximize the trip without really imposing. He speaks good english too. I highly recommend contracting with him for a remarkable trip in Siem Reap.Tip: Follow his instructions and time frame because he knows the perfect place to be at a given time."

We found Navuth on a website when we were planning our honeymoon trip to Cambodia, and decided to book him as our driver for 2 days, for a very reasonable price of $40.00. We visited various places on our first day, including the butterfly park and silk farm, and our second day was dedicated to the temples of Angkor. We opted for the dawn start, so that we could watch the sun rise over Angkor Wat, and Navuth then led us around 6 of the most interesting temples in the Angkor archeological site. Not only is Navuth a very knowledgeable guide, he also very cleverly chose a route which is the reverse order that most visitors see the various temples. This meant that we avoided a lot of the crowds for the first few hours, and we really appreciated being able to walk around in relative peace.Overall, we can't thank Navuth enough, and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great guide."

He showed us around and gave us information about not only the temples but also the Khmer empire and what followed afterwards in the modern Cambodian history. This was much more than expected since we did not hire him as a tour guide. But it was definitely interesting to be able to understand more about the temples and the Khmer history and we were happy to have such a knowledgeable tuk tuk driver!Mr. Navuth made our trip more enjoyable in a few ways. As an experienced guide, he suggested when best to visit each temple (e.g. departing at 5am for sunrise, how to avoid crowd). He also facilitated our full days of walking by pointing out an efficient route to visit temples and waiting for us at the right spot. Also, we particularly liked the fact that he was honest about prices. We got to know him after arriving from Phnom Penh by bus. The tuk tuk ride into town was supposed to be $3 and he offered it to us the first time. As we saw other drivers charging $8 to other passengers, we were happy that he is honest. We highly recommend Mr. Navuth for visiting Angkor temples in Siem Reap!"

He is so knowledgeable and willing to share the stories and history as many as he can during the 1st day of being our tour guide. Even we just asked him to be our guide for the 1st day and driver for the rest days, as we arrived each place on the 2nd day, he would kindly tell us many informations about the place and then let us go explore by ourselves. He is so nice that we can disguss whether the places we would like to visit or not. He will suggest some best photo-taking standing points. I'm also impressed that when we asked the price of going to the tonle sap lake (a bit far from the Siem Reap city central) he reccomanded after we went to Banteay Srei that morning, he replied that we can pay as much as we like! Navuth smiles a lot and talks sincerely, which make us feel safe in these days. Because of the public security in Phnom Penh (we went here after Siem Reap) is a bit more dangerous than Siem Reap, Navuth kept contacting us and asked how we were doing in Phnom Penh. He is such a caring person. We would totally consider him as our first choice for tour guide and driver if we go Siem Reap again in the future.John."

We contacted him by writing him a text to which he responded very quickly, providing us with a short overview of the three days and the price. Each day he was at least 10 minutes early, even when we did the sunrise visit of Angkor Wat at 5 am!! He provided us with cold water whole day long which was included in the price. He drove us around to every temple and before entering he would provide us with some short information about the history of the temple, in the meanwhile he does not do any other rides, he waits for you to finish your visit. In one word, excellent!!! Navuth is really friendly, and it's great to see that he has so much success with his own company.

We only met very few other tourists there and it was a remarkable insight into Cambodian life on the lake.Navuths car is very comfortable for the drive, and it will give you plenty of time to learn the history of the area. Navuth is very knowledgable.It is tricky to compose a nice trip to Kompong Khleang. The tour agencies charge 72 USD per seat in a mini bus. We hired a car with driver and guide for 30 USD for two people for the entire day. The service was excellent. Timely pickup, knowledgeable guide. Navuth told us lively stories of life on and by the lake. He helped us to rent a private boat for a 2 hour trip on the river/lake for 23 USD per person and guided us during the boat trip as well. And we could manage the day exactly as we liked. At our pace. Stop for photos and food along the way etc.Simply perfect private tour.. And half the price of the tour agency."

He also gave us good suggestions on places to visit, and took us to the best shopping spots and pleasant restaurants to dine-in throughout our trip.With his help, we enjoyed tuk-tuk rides around the city centre as well as the Highlander car rides for the official tours to the various ancient historical temples in Angkor Archeological Park and other places of interest in Siem Reap. After our tiring walks around the temples, he even prepared cold mineral water bottles and wet towels for our comfort, all the time. We also appreciated his efforts and his willingness to take us wherever we wanted to go. He accompanied us throughout our five-day tours and was very patient especially when we took time sight-seeing and walking slow-paced with our elderly parents. He helped us take family photographs and showed us good photo spots and, on occasion, acted as our translator when dealing with locals who dont speak English. His honest recommendations on making worthwhile purchases /shopping as well as in handling local street vendors was very useful.Mr Navuth helped to make our trip truly memorable and enjoyable. Thumbs up for Mr Navuth!!"

On the first day when we reached Siem Reap, he picked us up at 3am+ in the morning just to catch the sunrise at AngKor Wat. As we did not plan our itinerary fully and only have a day to spend at the angkor archaeological park, he gave us advice on which temples we should visit so that we do not miss out on the \"must sees\". He even act as tour guide and share the history of the temples with us. He also gave us lots of suggestions on where to visit on the 2nd day of our trip and he brought us to visit the Kompong Phluk floating village (instead of the rather commercialized Chong Khneas) where we get to experience the life of the people living there. The ride to the place where we board the boat to Kompong Phluk was long and bumpy. But he frequently check on us to ensure that we are fine. He even prepared cold mineral water for us when we did not ask for it. Really appreciate the things he did for us... and 2 days spent with him felt like we are friends for a long time. If you are looking for a full day tuktuk driver with basic command of english and reasonable charges, Mr Navuth is definitely the best choice. :D Will definitely engage him as my driver and tour guide if i'm back in Siem Reap!"

Mr Navuth took us to many places of interest. As we did not really planned our Itinerary fully , he gave us suggestions to where we could go, what we must see and eat! He made us feel what it is like to live the life of a villager and a tourist, which i think it is important. With his help, my firends and i found no difficulty blending into the country.This will not be possible without Mr Navuth's help! Mr Navuth is very patient and always waiting for us punctually at the stipulated timing. His charges are very reasonable as well. You will never get his price with other Tuk Tuk drivers, furthermore he also plays the role as a tour guide. explaining to us the history of the places we visited. He always put our safety, well-being in first place. For eg, we told him that we were tired from all the temple trekking, he would re-plan our itinerary for us, but at the same time making sure that we don't lose out on any places of interest.Once, on the bumpy roads to the floating market, Mr Navuth displayed his concern by ensuring that our safety was put in the first priority and constantly checking on us. When we told him we want to buy some backpacks, he brought us to wholesale markets where we got ourselves a really good deal =)I will recommend my family and friends to hire Mr Navuth again to show them around SR! He is really good and honest as well!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! He made our SR trip a memorable one!"

He brought us to three temples at Angkor Archeological Park and gave us a very detailed explanation of the history and religion of each temple. Mr Navuth has a basic command of English, but is very serious about his job. Although we have only engaged him to be our guide for Angkor Archeological Park, he accompanied us to Tonle Sap and brought us to a good location to view the sunset. He also volunteered to pick us up for free when we moved from one hotel to another. He is definitely someone who goes the extra mile to provide the best service to his customers."

Visiting Siem Reap and Angkor is an awesome experience, especially if you have the right person providing you with tour advice and transport; Navuth is that person! On my first visit to Angkor I was lucky enough to chance upon Navuth and had him as my Tuk Tuk driver for 3 days, and the high level of service he provided only made my experience more enjoyable. He is polite, punctual, speaks good English, and is passionate about his country and people. I found his ability to provide a high level of customer service, without being intrusive absolutely perfect. So when planning my recent trip to Siem Reap, this time with family, I contacted Navuth to help plan our stay. He has worked hard to expand his business, but that commitment to making your trip memorable hasn't changed. We spent some time exchanging emails and planned a range of day trips that simply amazed my sister and niece who were on holiday with me. We visited the main Angkor temples by Tuk Tuk, but also used his car to visit sites further out of Siem Reap; these being Beng Mealea Temple and Kompong Khleang fishing village, both of which were amazing. My advice? Contact Navuth, visit a few of the sites with less tourist pressure, and enjoy you time in this amazing country!"

Even took us for breakfast and lunch aswel and showed us a good travel place to buy our bus tickets for a cheaper price than our hostel."

He has great suggestions if you want them, but he's also very happy to adapt any plans as you like. His tuktuk is also super comfortable and clearly well looked after.

            "review": "Angkor by motorbike. We found Sina's Ankor Tour Arrangement through tripadvisor and I am so happy about it. We really wanted to see and learn a lot about Siem Reap's treasures, without being surrounded by tourist masses all day. So I asked Sina if we could book a tour that matches these expectations and if we could to it on a moto. We figured out a perfect tour and got us a very knowledgeable tour guide, Vanny. On day one Sina was also with us to provide us with cold water and towels, some inside stories and watch the scooters when we were in the temples. Here's the tour we did.As we arrived \"late\" on day one with the night bus, we decided to do the sunrise Angkor Wat on day two and start with the smaller sights at 8 o' clock. Sina picked us up at the hotel where we were allowed to move into our room at 7 already (most tourist do a daytour starting at 5 or 6 and check-out super early in Siem Reap). He took us by tuk tuk to the scooter place to get our scooter (leaving a passport as security). My boyfriend and I shared a scooter. You can also get one for each for a little bit more. We also met our guide Vanny there who rote his own moto. From there we went to the main entrance to get a 3 day pass for Angkor. It costs 20$ for a day and 40$ for three. If you do a two day like us is much better to get the three day ticket because the next day you can skip the process and the queues.We then went to the farest temples Banteay Srei with a ride of about an hour. But we stopped in a little village on the way to see the local market and taste some food. Also we stopped at the roadside where they sell all the palm sugar products to learn how palm sugar was made. Banteay Srei itself is really beautiful and at that time of day (like 10/10:30 am) there were very little people. On the way back we visited the East Mebon temple, Ta Som Temple, with a first cool entrance overgrown by a fig tree and then the really beautiful Neak Pean Temple. You cross a long wooden bridge over a swamp to reach the site, with the temple surrounded by water with parts of statues peaking out of the water. By that time it was 1pm or so. Beware to take enough water and a hat. Around noon it becomes incredibly hot, even in winter! Our last temple was Preah Khan. Vanny our temple guide taught us a lot about the history of all temples. About times and dates, the kings, the religious background and about the mural's stories. After the temples, we decided to rest for a few hours. At around five pm Sina picked us up again from our hotel for a ride into the countryside to see a bit of local agriculture and the sunset. It was very beautiful and a nice end to a beautiful day.On day two we started super early in the morning (5:00am) for the Angkor Wat sunrise. Usually, Vanny would have kept there with us until the actual temples opens (you watch the sunrise from outside), but to skip the crowds and get more out of the day, we continued with Thammanon Temple, Chau Say Tevoda Temple, Angkor Thom, Elephant Terrace, a very enhausting climb up to Baphuoun Temple, the beautiful buddha heads Bayon Temple first and then went to Ta Prohm. This was really one of my highlights. With the trees on top of everything, it's no wonder they chose to shoot Tomb Raider here. It's just magical. Eventually, we went back to visit Angkor Wat again and did a bigger tour on the inside and climbed up to top. We finished our second day at around 1pm but it was just enough to take in. All in all, it was a great tour, which was a lot of fun with the moto. We did a little detour in the woods with Vanny. That's when we felt like Indiana Jones. Vanny knew so much about the sites and the land, I hope I can remember enough to take home. And finally Sina was such a nice person that make everything happen what we imagined."

We arrived late at night and had to settle for a place quite expensive for the quality. Being young guys we decided to walk around a bit. We didn't get far, not 40ft from our accommodation when we we're called at by 3 men just sitting chatting. We decided we'd see what the fuss was about and that was it. We sat with Sina and his brothers for hours, having some drinks and talking. From then on we came to see Sina at least once a day, met his family and experienced an amazing rebirth ceremony, sitting on a bamboo mat on the ground we were waited on hand and foot with food and drinks, I'll never ever forget that night. He looked after us so well, took us to a better, nicer and cheaper place to stay, told us and even took us to places to eat. We also took his tours, which were fantastic. There are lots of places that sell the same tour but just knowing someone made it feel better to book. If you travel to siem reap, I highly recommend finding Sina, chat to him and from there do as you please. He doesn't push you, speaks very good English, very easy to communicate. We became good friends within the 7 days we stayed there and we still speak often now. I hope that one day he can come to Canada and maybe we can try and show him the hospitality that he showed us. And I mustn't forget, delicious coconuts for sale, among many other things! Great business and great family, go find them!!"

Then it was the ride on the Buffalo cart. Something most will never have done before and probably never will. A bicycle ride by ourselves, free to go anywhere at our own pace, we cycled a round the lanes for about half an hour, passing many locals in their scooters often carrying their children. The kids were very keen to wave say hello, smile and laugh at us/with us which was cool. Then it was time to eat and drink while watching the sunset. We had fried pork in batter with a sweet chili dip followed by a pork noodle dish complete with salad and sauce. Both were very nice. The weather wasn't brilliant for the sunset but that didn't effect the evening, it was very relaxing, peaceful and miles away from our normal lives. We sat and chatted with Mr Sokpee for a while before heading back to our hotel, arriving about 7ish$15 each was great value and worth every penny. This is a must do afternoon/early evening excursion whilst in Siem Reap. Drink included but you can purchase more if required at reasonable prices. "

The countryside and sunset is beautiful and it is just a great chance to get away from reality for a few hours and enjoy the peaceful environment. The company responded to my whatsapp enquiry very quickly and confirmed my reservation. Thank you so much for your professionalism and wonderful organising.

Roughly 30 mins drive outside the city, followed by a 5-10 minute ride on a buffalo cart which made us all laugh (kids 7, 10 and 16). There was a little rain on the August afternoon we were there, but that meant it was cooler for a 20 minute ride on functional bicycles around the village - which weirdly felt like the sort of thing we might do in a UK holiday town/village in east Anglia. This is a properly rural village,with duck farms and paddy fields ..it is not luxurious but at $15 per adult (including a small meal, a beer, transport and everything) and $10 for the smaller kids - it is worth it. Good to see a local guy trying to make something work outside the larger hotel chains. Do take mosquito repellant"

After pick up, we went on a buffalo cart ride (1km) and then got to explore the village a little on push bikes before settling in for the sunset overlooking paddy fields to the horizon in the distance. It was cloudy but this didn't take away from the experience. You can soak in the atmosphere with your drink and food as the farmers return from their day's work. It was very peaceful. And there was no pressure to leave after sunset which was a nice contrast to some other tours we went on and were rushed. For the cost, it was a great experience."

It was a short trip and to be fair short and sweet was the best thing. When we arrived at the sunset place we got some water and the lend of two bikes. We then cycled for about 20/30mins around the countryside and saw lots of locals who were very friendly. Saw lots of local kids and then cycled back to the sunset villa. We had some food and some beers and watched the sunset over the country. It was beautiful. All in 34 bucks. Good trip. Would go again."

I was also given a chance to cycle freely around an exotic village where the inhabitants are playing volleyball, planting vegetables and oh, yes, there were chickens and ducks roaming freely :):) Thanks for the wonderful and relaxing experience!"

You are given a ride in a wooden cart pulled by 2 Oxen...Cambodian Buffalo...? Whatever they are, it's fun. After the 15 minute ride to your new destination, you are offered bicycles to ride around the village area on your own for about a half hour, while it gets closer to sunset and they prepare your snack. I wish we had more time exploring the area on the bikes, it was my favorite. After this, you sit in the dining area and look out over the countryside, enjoying Cambodian snacks and a soda or beer (additional drinks cost $1 each) while watching the sunset and enjoying the evening. The owner, Sokpee and his family are very kind. Sokpee also speaks English and can answer questions, etc. Great alternative to an evening on Pub St. You get a small taste of the \"real\" Cambodia."

I sent an email to Sokpee who answered me in a few minutes setting up our pick up time and details (15$ each person). He went to our hotel at the exact moment we set and took us to the village by car. Sokpee is so far the best english speaker he met in Southeast Asia (he is also a tour guide, so I would highly recommend him for your temple tour). We arrived at the village and took a buffalo ride which was so much fun! After that we went to the spot for a few drinks while watching the sunset. My boyfriend got a bike to walk around and met some local people, including cute kids returning from school. The sunset view is amazing, right in front of rice fields! We finished the tour having this great meal Sokpee and his wife prepared for us. It was a great experience that I've never thought I would have in Siem Reap. Thank you so much, Sokpee and family!"

The evening is a great peek into a functioning Cambodian society.A leisurely self guided cycle through the surrounding area, water buffalo cart ride, spectacular dinner setting and delicious local food cooked by his wife provides a very relaxing evening. With door to door pickup/drop off, was initially a little worried about the decision when picked up in the family car. Not to worry, after a short conversation we realized he is in the early stages of the business and has limited resources. As well as bicycle and buffalo cart rides, meal and beverage all included, it provides great value for money. Highly recommended if visiting Siem Reap and wanting to get away from hustle and bustle of pub street."

We travelled through a rural area where the colours of the sky, the dirt and rice paddies were unbelievable. I really notice these things as I love photography, and it's just so different to anything at home. When we arrived we had the chance to ride bikes, go wandering and meet some locals, all of whom were friendly, before a beer and some great local food as the sun bid farewell. Have to say the value for money was unbelievable and our hosts were friendly and knowledgable. Would definitely encourage people to make room for this on their schedule."

The dishes were made locally from local produce. The spring rolls and noodle salad were absolutely great!Each tour has a limited number of seats making the whole experience even more unique. We were truly amazed about this whole tour - the friendliness and hospitality shared and the new insights about Cambodian life we gained.And the sunset is just a bonus. We got a massive rain just at the time of the sunset so we didn't see much. But that did not in any way take away the great memories we got from this tour.Go there!"

We were more than delighted. We were greeted by a very friendly host and his family with a cold drink and refreshing cold washers. We embarked on to an ox cart pulled by 2 water buffalos and set off for a tour of the local village and surrounds. Duck egg farms, rice fields, how people live in the village. My partner took his rod and lures. He caught no fish but the local children were facinated watching him..we then settled on to the verandah with a cold beer to watch the sun set. What a beautiful peaceful place to watch the sunset away from the crowds. They then served us an authentic rice noodle dinner with pork and chicken. So fresh and delicious  This was a unique and beautiful experience. We loved it."

But we followed the advice of our great tour guide Sokpee and were lucky to do so. Now is the rainy season and there was a lot of rain and lightning at this evening. But we stayed dry and saw a great sunny and rainy nature with a lot of animals, palms and a red sky. We cannot compare it with a sunset in Angkor, because we didn't see it. But we really had a great sunset on the countyside which we didn't want to miss. The countyside there is so completely different to the one at our home! So for us it was the right decision, which we can reall high recommend!"

He also tells you which things to avoid buying because there are a lot of items that are fake.

All I can say is that Viet from Angkor Vision Tour met me at the airport with a Lexus SUV and I was instantly put at ease and comfort and made to feel very welcome.His English is excellent, his knowledge of the Angkor Wat complex is very extensive, his personality is so pleasant and accommodating, everyone in town knows him and smiles when he comes around, and he is an EXCELLENT photographer. He knows all the spots to get the cheeky tourist photos and classic angles. Angkor Wat is almost overwhelming in its size and complexity. There is no way I could have experienced the site without Viet. Even without the amazing history, art and cultural lessons that Viet imparted to me during our tour, it would have been worth hiring him to drive me efficiently and safely around the complex area. But Viet's knowledge and pride in Khmer culture shines through through the whole day and believe me, you will come away with a new appreciation of the interplay of Hinduism and Buddhism and their attendant symbolology after taking this tour with Viet.I managed to lose my hotel itinerary before the tour was over. Viet was so kind that he helped me get to a local wifi spot so I could look it up and made sure I got safely to the hotel. After a day with Viet, I thoroughly trusted his judgement and asked him to show me around Siem Reap town at night. He took me to an amazing restaurant and then to a local beer garden and I really got to experience the way Cambodians let off steam in a safe place with a trustworthy guide.I cannot recommend him enough, he truly is the best tour guide I have ever met in my life."

We had an amazing tour guide and driver in Viet and Than. We originally booked our trip through a travel agency that created an itinerary for us, but then outsourced our trip to a local guide. Fortunately, we were lucky enough to land in Viet's hands. On our first night, he reviewed our itinerary and recommended some changes. While we were a little skeptical at first, we decided to trust our local guide. We are SO glad that we did! He recommended that we see an amazing waterfall, and take an excursion to outside the normal tourist sites to get a different view of Cambodia. Not only was the waterfall amazing, but my 7 year old son loved it; and it was the highlight of his trip. We got to swim and dive off rocks, enjoying the natural beauty that Cambodia offers. Siem Riep is not only about temples! In addition, Viet took us to the best meal we had on our entire trip. He took us to a local restaurant that was better than any five star hotel meal we had during our trip. I wish we had more opportunities to dine at recommendations from our guide. We would highly recommend your Siem Riep visit be with Angkor Vision Tour. Viet and Than (our driver) were both amazing. Not only was Viet knowledgeable and provided a wonderful history of the temples we saw, but he is also personable and fun; which made my 7 year old son comfortable in a foreign land. So much so, that he said Cambodia is his favorite vacation spot! Viet is very good at what he does. He has a great sense for people, was extremely attentive to us. He noticed when we were tired and in need of a break; but also put a lot of thought in planning our trip such that the cadence of our trip had just the right mix of getting a flavor for the local culture, learning about the history and temples, and seeing the natural beauty of Cambodia. Thank you Viet and Than! You created wonderful memories for me and my family; and it is truly appreciated."

Our guide Ty so\"viet\" was genuinely fantastic. He was enthusiastic and cared so much about his country and our wellbeing. He had a wealth knowledge and always had something new to tell us. There was never a dull moment. I noticed other guides while travelling around who were more like chauffeurs but viet was a proper guide!

After organizing our breakfast, he gave us a full tour of the temple, complete with detailed history and interesting stories. He was especially sensitive to our needs, and gave us just the amount of information we were looking for. Afterward, he took us to both the Bayon and Preah Khan temples as well. Along the way we stopped to see wild monkeys on the roadside, with whom Viet seemed to be especially good friends. We really enjoyed getting to know Viet, and learning not only about the ancient Khmer culture, but also about his life in Cambodia today. I would highly recommend a tour with him.

He is very accommodating, willing to guide your tour from dusk 'till dawn if need be. He also has a great sense of humour and a creative eye for taking photos. Transport was first class, always loaded with cold bottled water and plenty of disposable wet towels to cool us down. At the end of the tour, we have not only learned the life and history of the Khmers but have made a friend, Soviet Ty, who is very enthusiastic in his work. I will not hesitate to recommend him to anyone planning a visit to Cambodia. Okun,Viet!Roni,Jenny & Lisa."

I stayed in Siem Reap for almost three weeks and could have stayed another three weeks before feeling like I was leaving too soon. OH WOW, this is truly the time to see this phenomenal world heritage site while it is still only half restored, where you can see it how it was discovered and see it restored to its original grandeur. There is so much more to see than you can imagine, but it would be so much less memorable with someone like our guide Ty Soviet. What a name! What a guide! His ever friendly smile and attitude really sets him apart from other guides around the world. He's so excited about sharing his depth of knowledge and yet he knows enough to let you roam some at your leisure so you can do your own exploring. Having a private guide HERE is truly essential. Just SEEING is nothing compared to SEEING THROUGH THE EYES OF A LOCAL, a professional guide who understands that that \"surprise\" stop at the butterfly farm or an off-tour site few people see makes you realize how lucky it was to have such a guide. I feel like I really got to know the locals, see things you would never see with a tour group by going with Ty. Call him Viet or Ty or Soviet, he's simply adorable, well-spoken and funny, too. I'm hoping to return to see all that I missed. I need a week or two more, ok, maybe three before I will feel satisfied. Yes, I surely do recommend this guide if you want an affordable yet premier experience in Siem Reap. ENJOY!"

Its the small things that make it special. Its sure made a difference specially on a hot weather. He also recommended us to a Buffet dinner that showcased a cultural show. Overall the guide was Superb. I would rate 10 if I could. Thanks Viet for making Cambodia a special place. I would come back again and get your tour again."

            "review": "Amazing tour Guide. Our Family of 6 has just spent the last two days with Viet who has provided us with an unforgettable experience in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Our first day was spent visiting the Angkor Wat temples. This was truly amazing as Viet was able to provide us with so much history and gave us all a wonderful education. During the tour Viet was also excellent with our 11 year old son and had him very engaged for both days. This was definitely a bonus. The 2nd day we were taken up to Kulan National park where we were treated to a number of brilliant destinations including the amazing waterfall, a very large Bat cave (A priest was actually living inside) and an unforgettable motorbike ride (as a passenger) up to a very secluded area where very few tourists go to see some incredible ancient life size rock sculptures of an Elephant and various other animals. This was such a serene and beautiful place. Key benefits of the trip included:-Viet is without doubt the best guide we have experienced.-He has Excellent English-Helped us take amazing photos. He knows all the good places to take great photos-organised great lunch stops-Viet organised another special day for us to have a Cambodian meal with a local family in a village. Awesome experience for all our family.-great value-always had water available at each stop.-Viet had a great ability to avoid all the crowds. (Examples, We were at the waterfall after all the crowds left. Had a wonderful swim without any other tourists. We came in the back way to Angkor Wat, also avoiding all the crowds.) Our motorbike ride up through the Kulan Mountains will always be memorable. We are looking forward to our next tour with Viet. Simply amazing Thank you Viet"

Speaks good english and knows the prime spots for taking interesting pictures.It is our first time in Siem Reap and only have one day to tour the temples so we booked the 4 highlight temples + sunrise tour. It included transportation by car, plus cool bottled water whenever we need (for us after every temple we visited lol) and a refreshing wet face towel that felt heavenly after a day of walking around.With our sunrise tour, we passed thru the gate where we don't have to walk very far, and as the people where quickly piling up we felt happy that we got to sit on a good spot. The stories and history tidbits he told were fascinating and made roaming around the temples more meaningful. Viet also helped us in booking the buffet dinner with Apsara traditional dance show. Again we were seated in a good location to enjoy the show.The impact he made to his past clients can be seen with notifications I get in FB, commenting on my uploaded picture and affirming their happiness with his exceptional service.I hope his endeavours and projects for the future (the children) of Cambodia breed more as hardworking and cultured as Viet is."

Viet picked us up at our hotel early morning to see Angkor Wat at sunrise. He took us there through a quiet back road to avoid the crowds, and got us a front-row spot to experience the sunrise. After breakfast we extensively toured Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohm and Banteay Srei, which is about 30 minutes away by car. Viet explained the history of the temples in much detail, and told us many of the fascinating Hindu and Buddhist stories behind the beautiful carvings. He knows to find the best spots for taking pictures, and is quite the photographer himself. We much enjoyed the tour and can definitely recommend it. Viet was very accommodating to our personal preferences, so we skipped some of the busier sections of the complex in favour of some more quiet but equally scenic areas. The tour includes transportation by air-conditioned car which was a nice break in the hot and humid weather that we experienced."

The tour guide, whose name is Viet, picked us up at our hotel in an air-conditioned, four wheel drive Lexus SUV with California license plates! (You must ask Viet for the backstory about the SUV if he drives you in the Lexus.) He even provided us with water for the day. The waterfall and Beng Mealea temple are located some distance away from Angkor Wat, sometimes over uneven and narrow roads including a stretch up a mountain. The SUV was perfect for the ride. The scenery and sites were great, but what we most valued was the history lesson Viet gave us. Viet is extremely knowledgeable, articulate and considerate. It made this private tour most enjoyable. We learned more about Cambodian and Southeast Asian history in one day that in any other day of our tour of Vietnam and Cambodia. He was the perfect host: always taking photos for us and attending to whatever needs we had. You can't go wrong with Angkor Vision Tours. We had time only for the waterfall and Beng Mealea tour. But if you also want to see Banteay Srei and Phnom Bakheng, this is the way to go."

When we were ready, Viet guided us through Angkor Wat/ Angkor Thom (Bayan) / Ta Phrom explaining the ancient history, artifacts & Hindu/ Buddhist symbolisms. He spoke clearly (w/ superb English) & passionately about the ruins and even shared some of his personal stories. He offered to take photos for us and gave us local recommendations about Siem Reap. It was a long, hot day, so being chauffeured around in an air conditioner Lexus with unlimited cold water made the experience all the better (people on the tuk tuks looked so hot).My time with Viet was one of the highlight of my trip to Cambodia - thank you so much.

He picked us up at the airport upon our arrival, made a quick pit stop by the hotel, and then we were on our way to our temple adventure. Viet is not short on stories or jokes. He is able to explain the history of the temples and Cambodia as a Country. He also shared stories that were close to his heart about his family and village. He is working on projects to better the education system in his village as well as to continue his own education. He is an inspiration. He is the definition of a self-made man. He works hard to get to know you as a customer and to gain an understanding about the country you are from. Viet transported us in a very nice air conditioned SUV and had water and cold towels for us whenever we needed them. He took us to a local restaurant for lunch and offered suggestions for dinner. In the two days we were with Viet he took us to five temples including Angkor Wat where we spent three hours. He shared so much history with us about the temple. It was an absolutely amazing experience. One last thing about Viet: He\u2019s a semi-professional photographer!!! We only had our iPhone with us, but Viet knows all of the secret spots, the perfect lighting and how to avoid crowds! We have so many photos from our two days with Viet. The memories will last a lifetime! Thank you VIET!!!! I wish we had more time in Cambodia."

Soviet certainly looked after us well and was very knowledgable about the temples and the history of his country.Vehicles that we travelled in were late model comfortable vehicles with air conditioning. He supplied water bottles. He and his driver always arrived on time and made sure that your trip was one to remember. My last trip was July 2013 (not August 2014 as below but had to put in one of theie dates as it was a compulsory field)."

Viet even took us to a small village where we had donated a well to a family and then took us to the airport at the end of the trip. Soviet became our friend in just a few days and we were sad to say, \"Goodbye.\" He has such a serious side for a younger guide and we really enjoyed that. Cambodia ended up being our favorite destination on the trip and Soviet was the big reason why. I highly suggest Soviet as your guide and let him take some of the fun pictures you would never find!!"

He was recommended to me by a friend and is a font of knowledge on this area of Cambodia. His English is excellent and he has a most engaging personality. Nothing is too much trouble for him and he not only knows where to take you, but more importantly, when to visit certain sites to avoid the crowds. For honesty, professionalism and hard work I could not recommend a better tour company than Angkor Vision Tour and their guide Soviet Ty."

He knows virtually everything about his subject matter, and takes you to all the important places in Ankor, but he also adds in little touches, surprise stops, local places where you would never go with a package tour. Try an afternoon with him at the butterfly farm, it's small, but well worth a visit. He adds suggestions and stops to introduce you to local families and how they prepare their daily lives. He can also take you out to see the Tree House Villages in the lagoons, which no one should miss while in Siem Reap. He likes doing special things to make your visit memorable. As for me, I will NEVER FORGET his kindness for me when it was my birthday. He's quiet charming. Very likeable. I highly recommend him.."

My family spent 4 wonderful days in Siem Reap, and Soviet Ty (Viet) is an amazingly helpful, humours, smart and caring guide and also a great photographer who has made our trip a truly memorable experience. I would strongly recommend him and his company, Angkor Vision Tour to anyone who is interested in visiting Siem Reap (and other parts of Cambodia). The temples are magnificent, the view is breathtaking. And above all, Viet is very good at picking the best time of the day to visit the attractions (so as to avoid the crowd), and choosing the best spot for photo taking. He is also very flexible and caring. He speaks very good English and is very friendly. I am more than happy to introduce him, and his Angkor Vision Tour, to everyone who might be interested in going to Cambodia - I am sure this is one the best ways to explore this amazing and magnificent country."

He is patient, kind, honest, and has a good sense of humor! We had a great time with Dara and loved getting into the nicely air conditioned SUV after each temple. Our driver was very sweet and always opened the door for me as I got in and out of the car. Not necessary but he insisted! He always had ice cold water for us when we returned to the car.

The tour was also relaxed. He didn't rush us from site to site, so we were really able to enjoy each destination. One admirable experience with Dara was when we went back to our hotel for lunch. He said he'll pick us back up after two hours. There must have been some changes in his plans such that he waited for me and my friends for the entire time he was supposed to be out. He waited for more than two hours, but despite that, there was no change in his demeanor. He was still his friendly self. He also allowed my group to do our shopping while he waited in the car.I also appreciated it when he recommended a buffet place where we can watch the Apsara show and get value for our money! He even made the reservations for us. We heard that it isn't usually the case with other tour groups, wherein they just drop you off along Pub Street and you find your own restaurant.Before the day tour ended, he didn't even mention anything about the payment. He waited for us to give it to him. All in all, it was a great experience for our group. If ever I will go back to Siem Reap, I will use his tour outfit again."

I had visited alone in 2005 and has selected Mr. Dara quite randomly from his internet posting for car services. His services primarily as a driver then had impressed me immensely. He had gone above and beyond to provide guidance and local advice, usually given by a dedicated guide. He provided suggestions for sequencing the venues, when to take breaks and extended his service into the night to cover for a late evening dinner. I was extremely impressed with his professionalism, knowledge and courtesy.Over the past 10 years, I have recommended him to many visiting friends and relatives, all very impressed by Mr. Dara who took excellent care of their individual needs. Over the years, Mr. Dara has now evolved professionally, training formally as a private and official tour guide.When I planned for this visit with my family [wife and daughter], of course I contacted Mr. Dara who provided an immediate response. We finalized the plan over an exchange of several emails. He arrived with the car 10 minutes ahead of schedule at the hotel for our pick up. All through the day of touring the Angkor area temples [Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Bayon etc.], he provided an invaluable commentary on the history and heritage of the sites. He had even suggested taking us for viewing the sunset but we went to a Buddhist monastery in Siem Reap town instead. Unlike other private tour guides who often stear and pressure clients into shopping and restaurants for commissions, Mr. Dara not once made any such suggestions. He is very observant and assisted my wife during many portions of steep climbs at the temples, by carrying her handbag, so that she could comfortably find her stepping and balance. Mr. Dara is extremely honest, well mannered and soft spoken. We are all grateful to him for not only exceeding expectations but delighting us with memories of a lifetime. I will highly recommend and refer him to any one who is planning on visiting Siem Reap and other sites in Cambodia.Shankar Sarkar, Chicago, USA"

My husband, my mother and i are world travelers and have been on a variety of tours from group to private tours but our tour with Dara in Siem Reap was the best. We spent three nights in SR and enjoyed our stay very much. Besides the individual attention, Dara was knowledgeable, helpful, and accommodated requests readily. For example, we ran out of time at the Artisan Village but he made sure we returned the following day to finish our exploration and shopping.Dara also has a great sense of humour and was willing to share that side of him after he knew that we had a sense of humour too.We communicated with Dara through email 5 months prior to our travel to SR and he was quick to respond to our call for a tour plan, and transportation and hotel suggestions . He informed us about the frequency of our contact due to his (in)ability to access email while on tour. Despite his busy schedule, we found that his response time to our emails to be reasonable.Dara did not disappoint and we were sorry to leave SR so soon. We highly recommend Dara as a guide."

This Round, Mr Dara change all that. He was helpful, reliable and very honest. Knowing that tourist like us have limited time to experience things, he was never late picking us up at every locations that we were nor delay us in anyway. I was introduced to him via Cambodian Children House of Peace (CCHP). This round I brought 7 students with me where Mr Dara was very patient with everyone and took the time to explain the history of areas we visited. His driver was very helpful on the day where we needed to visit the orphanage. He was out with me to find, negotiate the rates wight he locals for us and carry stuff back to the orphanage without a complain or a show of face. It was all done with a warm and eager face to help.If I return to Cambodia, He is definitely the guy to look out for to help me again. Thank You."

After researching and reading reviews about him, we decided that he just might be the tour guide for us. I emailed him and got a quick response. We asked him to come up with an itinerary for us and a quote as to how much it would cost. He provided us with a detailed itinerary, costs of the tours, and inclusions of the package. We traveled to Siem Reap in a group of 8 and he took us around in a van loaded with cold water (trust me, you'll need it!). Mr. Dara made transfer arrangements so easy for us. Half of the group arrived by plane and had a 1 day tour ahead of the rest of the group. When the hotel pick-up service misunderstood the arrival of the people who traveled by land from Ho Chi Minh City, he picked us up with the first group with no hesitation. He made sure we saw the best parts of the temples and told us some history about each temple and each section we would visit inside the temples. He would even guide us through \"secret passages\" in some of the temples. He would let us take the best route in and out of certain temples. He also took photos of us on top of Ba Phuon using his phone and sent it to me as soon as there was internet. Talk about a techy tour guide! He also helped us book our bus tickets to Bangkok. He made sure that our stay is his beloved country was as hassle-free as possible! Given the chance, we would definitely go back and visit this culturally-rich country of Cambodia and get Mr. Dara Rann to guide us around again!:)"

A country is as good as its people and in Dara (meaning \"the Star\", in Khmer) we found the spirit of Cambodia, soft spoken, gentle and proud to be Cambodian.Siem Reap's glorious past edged in stone tell no tales but Dara's accurate account and passion for the characters came alive with Dara's story telling. He did not \"sell\" Siem Reap but shared his Khmer heritage with passion. We visited Beng Melea, a temple consumed by jungle and left as it is. Carvings were impressive. It drizzled while we were there and Dara immediately provided us umbrellas!!We caught the sunrise at Angkor Wat and this temple is amazing with its galleries - there are 3000 Apsaras (heavenly nymphs) carved in the stones and these ladies all have different hair dos, not to mention their fluidity of their movements in the stone!! Angkor Wat literally means \"Heaven on Earth\" and this temple is worth a few visits, if you have time! Dara brought us to Angkor Thom, \"the Great City\"-the entrance to the temple has 54 gods and 54 demons engaged in a tug of war and Dara explained this to symbolize that our lives are always pulled by good and evil and we have to stay in the middle pathway! Bayon was built with 54 (to represent the 54 disticts then) huge towers of 4 faced Buddhas who had the face of King Jayavarman VII. To date there are only 37 towers standiing. Every which way you turn, there is Buddha face looking at you!We toured Phimeanakas which once housed the Royal Palace. Dara pointed out the Terrace of the Elephants and the Leper King to us. The Celestial Jail cells were narrow units of building used as a justice measure - if 2 persons had an argument or dispute, the 2 of them would be locked up in this \"jail\". The first person to fall sick is the \"wrongful\" party of the dispute. The 2 persons would be confined for an indefinite time until one of them falls sick! This method would save so much money for any governing body dispensing justice in a court of law!!Dara brought us to Banteay Srei, the jewel in the Crown of Khmer craftsmanship! The temple is of pink sandstone with 3 D effects filled with fine details. Dara's stories here were a delight.Siem Reap has 30 or more temples to visit - we managed to see only 12 of them and without Dara, we would not have covered so much. Dara's unassuming personality endeared us to him. He knew the best spot for a photo shoot and would bring our attention to things we would not have seen. To top the spot, he would always have a story to tell. We enjoyed his company very much. It was very hot when we were there 2 weeks ago and Dara punctuated the heat with his humour and cold water bottles! What i liked about Dara is his honesty and his genuine love of Khemer heritage. This made us want to go back to see and experience more at a different time of the year."

Dara and his driver, Khean, toured us around for 4 days in a minivan with a/c and really made this a memorable experience. There was never a hint of hurrying us or steering us towards the usual tourist traps - souvenir shops, etc. He even managed to find me a replacement for my size 47 flip-flops when a thong broke!

He and his tuk tuk driver picked us up at the airport, then we dropped our bags at the hotel and went directly to Angkor Wat. We toured with him for 3 days and the driver took us back to the airport. He is very smart and funny and soft-spoken but quite knowledgeable. He doesn't overwhelm you with facts but can answer any question. Also he is a wealth of info about daily life in Cambodia.Most importantly, he excelled at tailoring our the tour to our interests and needs. We seemed to avoid most of the crowds and were at the temples with sunlight just perfect for photos. He helped us understand the history and religions of Cambodia, as reflected in the temples. We also developed a deeper sense of how poor the people are and what their challenges are.We are new to hiring guides. We learned that it is the best investment to get the most out of travel to a country where you don't speak the language. Dara took the hassle and frustration that we would have encountered in a tourist destination like Angkor Wat if we had done it on our own. Instead of spending money on souvenirs, we spent our money on a great guide who make our trip very interesting.We recommend Dara Rann with great enthusiasm!I suggest you email him directly to reserve your time: Dara Raan raandara1980@yahoo.com"

This was largely thanks to Mr. Dara, my expert guide and now, friend. I had booked his services online a few months before my arrival and didn't know what to expect. For that matter, I arrived at Siem Reap airport unsure if the man was actually real and if he'd even be there. You just never know what you're going to get with travel arrangements such as these. It was my pleasure to find him waiting for me outside customs. He was smiling brightly and welcomed me to his country. Bags in hand, Dara took me right to my hotel. For the next four days, Dara cheerfully arrived each morning at my hotel and we were off to the temples. It was an amazing experience. As a photographer, I was extremely grateful for the many times he led me to hidden spots where I could capture wonderful images that otherwise would have been missed. He REALLY knows these temples! There was never a rush, never a frown and always a maximum effort to make sure that I was having a spectacular time. I wanted to add the balloon over Angkor Wat to our already busy itinerary and he made sure to get me there, but to have me on the sunset ride on my second day. He's courteous, knowledgeable and friendly, but what mostly impressed me was his very sincere desire to share his homeland with a stranger and convey it as a source of happiness and pride. Finally, I would add that his services are so reasonably priced, you simply cannot lose. Make Mr. Dara your guide through Siem Reap and Angkor -- You won't be sorry!"

We agreed on a price, and for the tour we had a car, a driver and him as a guide and cultural interface. Dara and his driver were low-key, precise and their unspoken motto was \u201cthe customer is our boss\u201d. We wanted a taste of the real Cambodia. So we asked them to find us inexpensive lodging and to take us to the places they would go to to eat, avoiding tourist restaurants. The only place they refused to take us, was because the road wasn\u2019t in any conditions for the regular car we were travelling in. From Siem Reap we went North to Sa Em, then South to Kampong Thom, Kampong Cham, Takeo and Kampot, ending our tour in Phnom Pehn, at which point they drove back home to Siem Reap, while we stayed on for a few days to visit the capital on our own, returning to Siem Reap by bus. We would recommend Dara to anyone. He is pleasant company, responsible and professional in spite of his young age and, price-wise, he asks what is right. In Cambodia everybody improvises himself as a guide, and the smokescreen created by the language gap can really disorient the visitor and make him miss the essentials. For this reason it is important to get a guy who can act as an interface and a touchstone. Dara is very good at that."

It was a year ago that I planned to visit the Angkor Wat, after I heard about a rumour that the temple will be demolished (which wasn't true, its a World Heritage Site after all). At that time I wasn't thinking of needing any tourist guide. Later I met a friend which happened to visit the temple before. He told me that I'll need a tour guide as there are plenty of attractions and historical facts that I wouldn't know without a guide. He recommended me Mr Dara Rann thru Facebook, and from that day on every arrangement for the trip was made on FB messages and emails. Mr Dara never failed to reply with suggestions and itenararies that suit my needs. The fee charged for the three days was reasonable and affordable for a budget traveler like me. I was almost wanted to cancel the trip because of the flood, but he assured me that it wasn't that bad in Siem Reap (yeah, the 3 days trip was very sunny with little downpour during the night ). He was at the airport when I arrived, holding a very big sign displaying my name (which was very helpful indeed) and took me to the hotel with his air conditioned car. His English is very excellent (which I think is better than me haha). As a licensed tour guide, he has a very wide knowledge about the historical facts as well as folklore or legends for all the temples in Siem Reap. A part from that he also explained about the everyday Cambodian lifestyle, events and happenings in the city and at the rural area ( I really enjoyed the journey to the Beng Mealea thru the villages surrounded by greenery) . Throughout the three days, he was very punctual and professional and can be funny sometime XD. Not to forget that he's a great photographer too ( I travelled alone, therefore I need someone to snap my pics hehe). For Muslim traveler not to worry as Mr Dara can take you to the Halal food restaurant in the Siem Reap city. On my last day there he took me to the airport at very early in the morning because my flight was at 0750 am. Well, to wrap things up I should say that Mr Dara is an excellent tour guide, professional, honest and very courteous. One should never hesitate to has his service while travelling in Siem Reap. I had a very wonderful trip and experienced there and will do it again in the future, hopefully will be able to get to the Preah Vihear temple next time. Ahh...by the way \"Dara\" means star in Khmer, and yes he is a 'guiding star' indeed ;) - Anaque Li, K.L, Malaysia"

            "review": "Little more you could want. When we were looking for a guide in Siem Reap we made a mistake that almost cost us Dara\u2019s excellent guiding services. His website attracted us to contact him when we arrived in Siem Reap. However, we gave him a mistaken date of departure so he was apparently already booked. When we realized our mistake, we called him back. We had meanwhile spoken with two other recommended guides, but Dara was our clear choice for his steady demeanor, his efforts to be clear about our tours, and especially his enthusiasm, unique among the guides we spoke with, about our desire to visit the countryside and eat local food.We spent our first day with Dara at Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm. We were in our hotel lobby a bit before the appointed hour of 7. Dara was already waiting for us; the tuk-tuk driver he regularly works with arrived shortly. Dara\u2019s partner drove us slowly, carefully, and much more courteously than is the norm in Siem Reap to Angkor Wat. We were quickly impressed with Dara\u2019s knowledge of the temple. He told us he had started riding his bicycle to Angkor Wat in 1993 with a lunch so he could spend the day at the temple. In addition to the usual information about the structure, the details of the bas reliefs, and the use of various architectural features, Dara gave us some wonderful unexpected bits. For example, instead of facing east, the direction of life, as usual Angkor Wat\u2019s entry wall faces west, the direction of death; the deep pock marks in the king\u2019s entrance are the result of Khmer Rouge bullets; and an odd number of columns supporting the windows because for the Khmer, in contrast to the Chinese, the odd numbers are good luck. Well before we finished at Angkor Wat Dara had caught on to the sorts of photographs my wife is interested in taking. His first few suggestions for possible shots were so on the mark and so likely to have been missed by her that she asked him to make any suggestions he thought of from then on. He and I soon found we much enjoyed each other\u2019s sense of humor. We soon developed a game in which I, a former teacher, played the student struggling with Hindu mythology and Khmer history while Dara\u2019s was the demanding but gentle teacher. I did in fact learn a lot under his tutelage though I hardly dented his store of knowledge. We went on to Ta Phrome that afternoon. Dara promised my wife a truly spectacular though usually neglected tree to photograph. He not only gave her the tree but arranged an approach that made her first sight of the tree a delightful surprise.The next day Dara provided commentary and answered our many questions while his tuk-tuk driver took us at the leisurely pace we\u2019d requested through 40km of countryside to Beng Mealea. Prasat Beng Mealea was built by the king who built Angkor Wat to honor his teacher. Since the temple was dedicated to Vishnu, a later king given to Shiva had the temple razed to its current ruinous condition. Despite, or perhaps because of, its state Prasat Beng Mealea is one of the most serene places I have ever been.Having been much impressed by the website for an NGO near the temple called Harmony Farm, I had asked that we visit. Dara was unfamiliar with Harmony Farm so asked some of the local folks about it. According to them, the NGO had started out very well but had degenerated to the point that its primary benefactor had withdrawn support only days before. Thanks to Dara\u2019s diligence, we avoided a disappointing experience.About a week later we spent another day with Dara. We had originally planned to visit Bayon and Preah Khan that day. However, we\u2019d become very interested in visiting Bantay Srei, so suggested we skip Bayon, start the day with Bantay Srei and finish with Preah Khan. Dara suggested we really ought to see Bayon, even if only briefly. Moreover, he suggested we\u2019d do better to start with Bayon and Preah Khan since they tend to be very busy later in the day and finish with Bantay Srei which is busiest in the morning. We accepted both of his suggestions and were glad we did.It would have been a shame to miss Bayon, a wonderful monument to the inclusiveness of the greatest of the Khmer kings. While we were there a busload of Mormon missionaries arrived. Dara knew something of these folks, for instance that many were good to fluent in Khmer. But he is very curious, so asked me more questions about them than I was able to answer.Small but exquisite Bantay Srei is very high on my list of must see temples in the area. The temple known as the Citadel of Women was built about 150 years before Angkor Wat of pink sandstone. Because the pink variety is the hardest of the sandstones, the bas relief and inscriptions at the temple are almost as sharp as they were when temple was built a millennia ago. A story from Hindu mythology decorated the lintel of each door. Dara eagerly led us to a lintel few of the other guides we saw made anything of. Shiva is at the center, his wife to his right, Kama Sutra the archer god of love to his left. It seems Shiva had been neglecting his wife, so Kama Sutra shot him with an arrow so Shiva would again become attentive to her. In the bas relief Shiva is handing a rosary to his wife as the beginning of renewed affection. Later Shiva sees with his third eye what Kama Sutra had done. Furious at Kama Sutra\u2019s interference Shiva blasts the god of love into a million pieces. Kama Sutra may be gone but pieces of him are incorporated into humans as our capacity for love. This was but one of the delightful stories Dara has at hand to enhance your experience.From our first meeting with Dara we were a bit uneasy about his less than fluent English; we were aware that others had earlier commented on this. However, although his English sometimes took a bit of effort to understand, his less than perfect ability caused no real problems. He works hard at overcoming his limits. Several times he asked us about an unfamiliar word we\u2019d used and wrote down our spelling and definition. He is also for the first time taking classes taught by a native English speaker at a local private college. Of course it would be nice if he were more fluent in English, but, as far as we are concerned, he offers so much as a guide and person that his English is a minor matter."

Dara Rann is a fantastic driver and guide, with excellent English language skills and a great sense of humour. He has completed his formal 'guide' training with the local tourist authority, so is very knowledgeable about the history of the Angkor temples and the history of Cambodia.He has an air conditioned Toyota Camry and can act as both a guide and driver. He was very prompt at collecting us (and didn't disappear while he was meant to be waiting for us as we have experienced with other drivers/guides!) and always very friendly and helpful.He gave us advice about the best order to visit the sights we wanted to do so we could use our time efficiently and he very quickly worked out the types of activities that were of interest to us and made suggestions so we saw sights that we wouldn't otherwise have been aware of. One of our highlights with Dara was a day trip to Beng Mealea, a temple complex that is approx 2 hours drive out of Siem Reap. The temple is beautiful and not as touristy and busy as the central temples.We also explained to Dara that we wanted to make a contribution to local children who were living in difficult circumstances so he helped us buy some food which we then took to a local orphanage.Dara can be contacted at: [--]Details of his pricing and reviews from other travellers are at: http://www.talesofasia.com/cambodia-dara.htmPlease contact us if you would like any further information."

Honestly, what to choose was the toughest decision ever.Then, I posted a question in the mighty Facebook. I was getting quite a number of messages from friends, all recommending Nil Sareth from Q Travel Cambodia. Strangely enough, this tour agency never appeared in my previous google search.Without hesitation, I contacted Nil Sareth to arrange a 5-day tour. Eventually, we decided to exclude the Sunset Tour & only did a 4-day tour. In the process, our travel group has also increased from 4 pax to 6 pax. He was very accommodating. Some tour guide we experienced (elsewhere) would be pushy to sell us more optional tours that we didn\u2019t want. But, dealing with Nil Sareth, this wasn\u2019t an issue at all.The itinerary tailored by Nil Sareth seem like simple, and we didn\u2019t even know what to expect from this trip.By the time we got there, we truly felt that, our tour was different than the other tours, in a good way.For instance, we would take a less crowded path to visit the temple, getting from one temple to another temple at the right timing so that we could avoid crazy tour buses, etc.Nil Sareth is fun, knowledgeable, professional & definitely passionate in what he\u2019s doing. He provided us sufficient amount of information about the temples & learning the ancient history was not as boring as we thought. He\u2019s like a walking wikipedia in answering our questions. He knew we wanted to sample authentic Khmer Cuisine. He brought us to places where no tour buses would go. The foods were insanely tasty & at a reasonable price range.I was a bit skeptical about the local cuisine at first as some of my friends who did the \u201cplan-their-own\" trip didn\u2019t really enjoy it.After my trip, I can only conclude that, it\u2019s tragic some of my friends didn\u2019t discover the authentic Khemer Cuisine.If you plan to visit Siem Reap, keen to know the ancient history of the temples instead of viewing them as merely stones, readily to sample the sumptuous Khmer Cuisine like a local, to experience the genuine local hospitality, you definitely need Nil Sareth.Also, a big thanks to our driver, Mr Bunthoeurn, who always be at sight whenever we were ready to leave from one site to another, who always thoughtful enough to turn-on the AC before hand & let us enjoyed a nicely-chilled mini van."

It was my first time to Siem Reap and so wasn't really sure what to expect. I followed his suggestion on what temples to see that were contingent my time restrictions of the tour. I was very impressed with how he took the time time to explain the details of the temples and those who built them as we walk through them. He pointed out certain things I would have over looked if I were to go through on my own. I really loved the fact that he knew all the sweet spots to take photos of the temples and even with myself in some of them. I look forward to the next time I go to Siem Reap. I know that Serath has so much more knowledge to share with me next time I take his tour."

He was not only prompt and knowledgable, but he was able to really showcase the temples in a very meaningful way. Since we only had one day to visit the temples on our trip, I really felt like he was able to fit all the big temples into our tour and time it in a way that we avoided huge crowds and wrapping up before the heavy heat of the afternoon set in. We also added on the sunrise at Ankor Wat, which was incredible and the narration about the history and background about the temples that Sareth provided while we setup was really good. He also had us in line early to enter the top tier of Angkor Wat before it opened so the timing was perfect to only have to wait a short bit instead of the monster of a line it was an hour later. Lastly, as the tour came to a close, he was able to recommend a great restaurant to us to enjoy some Cambodian food before returning us to our hotel. In all, we'd highly recommend using Nil Sareth."

He always shows up early with a driver and air conditioned SUV. This allowed us to be dropped off at the front of the attractions and stay as long as we wanted. He never left our side. He has extensive knowledge of the area, its history and culture. Sareth took the time to point out and explain things to maximize our visit . I have traveled all over the world ,but have never had a better guide. He can offer excellent advice on hotels and things to do during your free time. Because of Nil Sareth, I came away with a much better understanding and appreciation of the World Heritage Sites, the culture and people of Cambodia."

            "review": "5-STARS for NIL SARETH and Q TRAVEL. While planning our trip to Thailand this year my husband and I decided on taking an additional three-day side trip with a friend. Another friend in Bangkok recommended we visit Siem Reap, Cambodia and take a tour of Angkor Wat and other sites. He also highly recommended we contact NIL SARETH of Q Travel as our guide and ask Sareth (first name) to arrange we travel by air-conditioned car. All recommendations were superb. Sareth was easy to contact via Facebook messenger and replied promptly to all my queries in the best English. Although we booked him only 4 weeks out from our December dates, we were fortunate that he was available on the date we requested. (If he is not personally available, his Q Travel will provide you with another qualified guide.)Sareth arrived on time at our resort hotel with a great car and excellent driver. He was professional in manner, very personable and easy to talk with. A kindred spirit. We spent the later part of our morning visiting Angkor Wat for around 3 to 4 hours. Sareth took his time explaining all there was to know about the history of Angkor Wat and the Khmer and in answering all questions. For lunch he and driver took us to a special favorite restaurant where we had the best food for lunch. The banana leaf salad Sareth recommended was my favorite. Afterward we continued on to a few other sites.Sareth was also helpful in guiding me to locate the kind of shopping I was looking for in Siem Reap. Parting was sweet sorrow.On a final note: I have visited Cairo, Egypt, twice and the great pyramids of Giza, and Luxor's Valley of the Kings. In comparison, Angkor Wat alone is by far many times more impressive in scope, art and architecture. I wouldn't have missed this trip, albeit only a short stay, nor meeting Nil Sareth, for the world. Also, while in Siem Reap ask Sareth about seeing the Khmer circus called Phare."

Whatever questions you ask him, he was able to answer, and he definitely gives you the most sincere recommendations for your trip around Siem Reap. He was fast on responding to emails during my trip planning and reachable during our stay in Siem Reap.Had my visit to Siem Reap on Feb 2016 and book him for 2-days tour to Mount Kulen and small circuit. Sareth is a very responsible tour guide. Despite he was sick on the 1st day, he still came over to check on us and to ensure we get everything arranged properly to visit the mount Kulen with the driver. But of course, if he was with us, the trip will be perfect.He brought us out on the 2nd day for small circuit. It was definitely an amazing day telling us the detailed story of all the archaeology and history. But what makes him different is that he knows his way around the historical park to avoid the crowd and that makes the whole trip so pleasant."

Since I was 17yo I've dreamed of visiting Siem Reap and all that it offers especially Wat Tah Prohm and of course, Ankgor Wat! I mentioned to good friend as my 50th birthday was fast approaching how wonderful it would be if i could get to SR and within a few weeks my buddy and I planned a trip of a lifetime with the highlight spending 5 days in SR! Once the trip was booked another friend who lived in SR mentioned to me that a visit to SR without Sareth would be remiss, So I immediately reached out to Sareth who designed a 3 day tour for us that was insightful, colorful, engaging and INCREDIBLE! Sareth has a wonderful handle on SR and was able to articulate so beautifully the magic that is Siem Reap. Day 1We spent the first day traveling in a private car along the wonderful countryside to Phnom Kulen National Park where we got to view the River of a Thousand Lingas, The Reclining Buddha on the top of a mountain, and a beautiful waterfall where we got an opportunity to swim! - INCREDIBLE! Day 2We headed out to visit the West Gate of Angkor Thom, Preah Khan & East Mebon, Then a nice drive to visit Banteay Srei and then finally a visit to Ta Phrom aka a DREAM COME TRUE! Day 3The FINALE - Visit Angkor Wat at 530am for sunrise which is a MUST then we headed to Angkor Thom, Bayon Elephant Terrace & the Terrace of Lepper King! We highly recommend touring with the most amazing, Sareth while visiting Siem Reap!"

Sareth is so full of knowledge on every aspect of the temples and the history, culture and religion surrounding each one. We avoided the crowds and saw each temple in peace. Banteay Srei (woman's temple) and Bayon (temple of the faces) were my favourites for their uniqueness and Angkor Wat was amazing. We saw 7 temples in total over 2 days and Sareth made each one memorable and unique. Plenty of ice cold water was on hand in the heat and the air conditioned car was definitely a must. Angkor is just huge!!Thank you so much Sareth. We had an amazing time. And thank you for your tips on local food and other experiences and places to visit for the rest of our trip!"

Some had arranged multiple tours with Sareth. I arranged a 3-day tour, and he clarified ahead my interests, dietary limitations, timeframes, etc. He then made suggested itineraries and allowed me to adjust. Even the day of, he would validate the itinerary was ok or suggest alternatives if the weather was not appropriate (too hot, too windy). During the tours he was well versed on the history, but did not go on incessantly like some guides. He could sense when you wanted more info or when you had enough info. And toward end of Day 1 when I was yawning and dozing off in the car, he confirmed if I wanted to end the day early. He arranged the transport and also eating venues during the day, checking ahead if I was ok with local cuisine.Sareth was also helpful in affirming quality of hotel and restaurants in Siem Reap, which others had recommended. And he had ideas for return visit. Finally, as he has traveled in the region, he could contrast food and cultural styles to Cambodia.Excellent tour and I will definitely arrange future tours with Sareth for myself or friends. Very personable yet very professional and always punctual.Hint: book early with Sareth as he is in demand from repeat clients, so may be unavailable. However, he would still arrange a highly qualified alternate guide at the level of his standards if he was unavailable."

Let's face it, we've all seen hundreds of photos, so I never felt the urge to get up at stupid o'clock. And then a friend came from India. It had been his dream for 16 years to visit Angkor Wat, and the guide books all told him not to miss this extraordinary site. How we all managed to get up at 4.00 am. It wasn't as if we were catching a plane. By personal preference we travelled by tuk tuk, and picked up our guide at 5.00am. Bright and breezy and wide awake. We had a chance to get acquainted on the way to the temple and Sareth came over as a great guy. By the end of our time together we felt as iif we had always known him.Sareth took us straight to the perfect place for our photos, carefully stage managing us milling about so that we did not get lost. I have to say, it was worth all the blood, sweat and tears.Never using a guide at the temple before, I was amazed at all the things I had overlooked on all my previous trips. There is so much more to see when you are with an expert who knows his stuff.The whole trip from start to finish was a real joy. And this guy is super friendly. He knows his stuff. My Indian friend is Hindu, and Sareth had this big conversation about the various gods worshipped by different religions. Impressive.I would not hesitate to recomment Sareth for his wit, his charm, his knowledge, his English and the cheerful manner he took care of us from start to finish."

I had booked a tour with Sareth 3 months in advance as I was expecting the high tour season in Siem Reap. My first contact with Sareth was via his Facebook page at Q Travel Cambodia. I had sent him a message via Facebook Messenger requesting his availability and suggestions on a two day tour. I received a quick response with detailed information. I had put out other requests to tour companies that went unanswered. Q Travel was the FASTEST response.I communicated via FB Messenger about three months in advance with Sareth to confirm our tour. While this time had passed, our friends decided to make the journey with us and our tour grew from 2 people to 9!! Not a problem for Sareth, he was able to arrange a larger van and make all the accommodations! The morning that our tour started, I wanted to meet with Sareth to brief him about our group. Once again, not a problem, he was prompt, with a kind smile at 4:45am!!! I can\u2019t even open my eyes at 4:45am, yet there he was, ready to start our day.We left prompt at 5am on our way to see the temple sunrise. What a magical moment. It\u2019s pitch dark and the magic of having the sun light up the area was a moment of my life I won\u2019t soon forget. After that, we proceeded on our tour of the temples. I feel what made Sareth stand out was his VAST knowledge and storytelling abilities. He knew so much that if we had done this by ourselves we would have missed so much!I could go on and on about our full day tour, but I\u2019ll share my one favorite moment.My favorite temple was Ta Prohm. Beautiful, beyond words. The way the story of love for the King\u2019s mother and how the jungle overgrew the temple, is just breathtaking. Day two was equally as perfect as day one. We stopped by the ACCB then off to my second favorite temple, Banteay Srei. The color and stone are beyond words! I hope you will take the time to book a tour with Sareth. He is kind, caring, patient and can give you as much or as little knowledge as you want.If you have ANY questions, feel free to drop me a line. As Angkor Wat is one of the ten man-made wonders of the world, this trip and our tour with Sareth from Q Travel Cambodia will rank as one of my 7 greatest moments in life!"

The first day we saw Angkor Wat, Ta Phrom, and Bayon, and the tour on day 2 consisted of a trip down to the floating village at Kampong Khleang followed by a visit to Beng Mealea. Sareth certainly knows which sites are of the most interest, and these are all excellent. He is very knowledgeable about each site. He took time to point out interesting features and tell detailed stories about the history along the way. Sareth's experience is very apparent. Whenever possible, we took alternate routes in the temples to avoid the masses of other tour groups. He also knew where to go to get the best pictures at each site. Aside from his excellent abilities as a guide, Sareth is a really warm person with a great personality and sense of humor.

Rather than relying on guidebooks or hotel recommendations I asked friends who\u2019d traveled here before who\u2019d they\u2019d recommend for a guide.Sareth Nil of Q Travel was the top recommendation, and after my tour I can see why. Even with my last minute plans, Sareth organized a great tour tailored to me and the areas I wanted to experience in next to no time during his busy season. Arriving early for pick up, Sareth and his driver made the half day tour an amazing experience. He\u2019s articulate, multi-lingual and brings history to life as he guides you around some of the most spectacular temples on the planet. Sareth is knowledgable, slyly humorous and just such a personable guide you can\u2019t help but love the history of Siem Reap as much as he does."

This is my second trip to Siem Reap but I brought my mother this time. And he was by far much better than the tour guide last trip. My mother and I did one day temples and one day stilted / floating villages plus some other interesting stops along the way. He was extremely knowledgable about all the sights and culture plus speaks perfect English. I will for sure be sending his info to any friends heading here and don't hesitate to take his tours is my advice to you."

Sareth was so accommodating, every request that I had was listened to and nothing was ever a problem. We only had a few days in Siem Reap but wanted to make the most of our time. We were greeted at our hotel right on time by Sareth with the brightest smile. He had organised a private boat for a journey along the river to see the floating village and sunset on the Tonle Sap Lake. It was the most memorable Sunset. So quiet and relaxing. It felt like we were the only people in the world. It was the perfect way to end our first day.The next morning we were up bright and early, again to be greeted by Sareth and his happy face - even though it was 4.30am. Second in line to get our tickets and front row for the Sunrise at Angkor Wat. Can't ask for more than that. It was one of those once in a lifetime experiences. We then avoided the crowds by visiting two other temples first before returning to Angkor Wat.Sareth was knowledgeable, funny, considerate, friendly, punctual and very professional. His English is great and he went above and beyond to make our time in Siem Reap one to remember. I would have no hesitation in recommending Q Travel Cambodia if you want to experience Siem Reap with the best guide. Sareth comes highly recommended."

We were all sad to say goodbye to Sareth at the end of our trip to Angkor Wat because we had grown so attached to him over the course of the day. At our request, he picked us up at our hotel at 4:45am. He greeted us with a smile and capably explained the plan for our visit. After handling the admission process we arrived at Siem Reap.If possible, arrive early enough to see the sunrise. Though it will already be crowded, the temple will be cool and the towers of the main complex will be beautifully silhouetted. Once it was light out, we drove to Ta Prohm, where Sareth explained the history of the Khmer temple complex at Angkor Wat and walked us through the structure. His descriptions of the art and architecture here and elsewhere were engaging for us as well as our 12, 16, and 19 year olds. After Ta Prohm we drove to Angkor Wat. Sareth ordered our visit as we did to avoid crowds and the decision to leave Angkor Wat and return later meant that we never waited in line or felt swamped. Though the main temple speaks for itself, Sareth illustrated for us the various Bhuddist and Hindu meaning to be found in the friezes and carving on the walls of the temple.We took a break in the early afternoon to eat lunch and return to our hotel. We returned in the late afternoon to visit Angkor Tom. Sareth was unflagging but adjusted the speed of the tour based on our energy levels without us needing to ask.If we ever return to Siem Reap we'll be sure to visit Sareth. We feel lucky to have met him."

He is extraordinarily knowledgeable about Angkor, but that's only part of why a tour with Sareth is so special. He really tailors the tour to what you want to see and hear about, and he's an expert on all sorts of out-of-the-way attractions that many tour guides would never recommend or even know about. Best of all, Sareth is just a joy to spend time with: he's forever happy and fiercely funny, and one of the most genuinely warm people I have ever met. I can't imagine anyone else providing such memorable tours of the Angkor region."

He is a very knowledgeable and fun guy. Q-travels arranged our 3 days exploration during which Nil customized our itinerary according to what we most wanted to see. He responded with additional suggestions which really interested us and so we went with the flow. We truly enjoyed the program he had planned for Kompong Kleang which is famous for stilt houses, floating schools, a nice countryside and Cambodian fisherman using thier nets. We explored temples for 2 days covering Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and Bayon, Preah Khan, Banteay Sarae and Prerup. Our schedule was well planned and unhurried covering everything we wanted to see and more. Everyday we returned to the hotel around 4pm so we could relax poolside and enjoy the occasional foot massage. Our driver La was wonderful, pleasant, attentive and eager to please. the car was more than comfortable. Water bottles and wet paper towels were provided in the car.We highly recommend using their service and will be going back again soon.Robin & Mark"

Usually we avoid tours like the plague, but this time, for various reasons we chose to do a 3-day private tour with Nil and Rom. Both guides were very knowledgeable and keen to answer any questions we had about the sights, history, Cambodia in general or the Khmer language itself (yes, we are geeks). We are far from easily impressed travellers, but we were very pleased with these 3 days, both with the guiding and the supporting infrastructure (mostly the well-cooled car :)). We learned many historical, cultural facts and got a little insight into the Khmer daily lives, had some nice meals in the lunch breaks, and took short naps while our private driver took us from one sight to the next. If you get a bit of a temple-overdose by day 3+, don't worry there are many other sights to see and things to do, just ask Nil. (Don't worry if you get lost in the Hindi god names, there is no test at the end. :))"

SarethMy partner and I chose to go to Siem Reap in the \u201ccooler\u201d season during January and weren\u2019t disappointed. I contacted our guide, Sareth, via the net and made arrangements to meet him at our hotel on the evening of the day that we arrived. We had already met a couple of British girls at the same hotel who were also looking the same sort of tours so we invited them along to meet him. Sareth made his suggestions of Angkor Wat for sunrise, along Bayon, Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm. In the darkened wee hours of the next morning there he was pre-dawn waiting for us at the entrance to our hotel with and air-conditioned van that would transport us to the temple precinct. This is when we started to learn his knowledge of Khmer history and the ruins and the ruins we\u2019d be seeing that day.Even whilst in the vehicle, Sareth was a storyteller, very accommodating of our questions, informative and delivered his responses in a personable way. He had customised our tour for us so the day was seamless. We arrived at Angkor Wat where there were several others arriving in the dark at the same time to witness sunrise over the ancient temple, but he led us to our only little space where we were extremely happy. It was indeed a much better than some of the larger tour which left early and missed some of the best photographic opportunities.We grabbed a quick breakfast nearby and then he took us through a journey of the Khmer Empire and some of the other awe inspiring temples of Angkor. He was passionate and engaging and his English is very strong. He timed it beautifully avoiding a lot of the crowds and we really appreciated the order in which he did things \u2013 with a lunchbreak after Bayon, Angkor Thom and Ta Prohm - taking us back to Angkor Wat during the afternoon when the majority of people had left. He even shouted us an ice cold fresh coconut juice to helps us through the afternoon. At day\u2019s end we were somewhat exhausted, but all realised we had a new friend in Nil Sareth whose knowledge and passion for his country is second to none. Q Travels Cambodia specialised in tailoring to our needs and interests. Our tour was well priced and I highly recommend them, and particularly Sareth."

So this time in Bangkok we could make the jump to Siem Reap and I booked a day trip with Angkor Wat Photography Workshops and Tours. Communication in the days before the trip in german made it quite easy for me to check everything. We booked also a night walk through Siem Reap. Thom, our tourguides meets us and we walk through the night market and had the time to know each other and especially the knowlegde of us concerning taking fotos. Pic up next morning was 4:45 am to be in time at Angkor Wat for sun rise and especially to be there before the hundrets of people block the best places. It was a nice sun rise - unfortunately there were no clouds that make the pictures more intresting - but that's nature. Follow up was a walk through the temple of Angkor Wat, an area where the monks are living. Thom showed us great places and his favorites of angles how to take pictures. As Thom was well trained in the tours he walks between the spots quick - so we had to slow him down some times a little bit ;-) On our list were Banteay kdei, ta nei, then we had the lunch breakt (at about 7:30, but I felt like 11) preah palliay, preah khan, and angkor tom south gate. All together for me a really great tour. Thom decided the places on his experience, when the people are in which temple at what time and e.g. at the restart in the afternoon (2:00pm) we started in a temple with more trees aroud, so the heat was not to bad for us. A little thing, that my friend remarked, was, that he felt a little bit \"pushed\" to take the pictures as Thom wanted to - for me no problem. I'll take the advice and if I don't prefere these settings, I do my own. So for me: Thom keep your way of showing the temples, keep your friendly open way of interacting with your customers and keep your attitude in taking pictures!"

Tom familiarised himself with my camera, and then explained his reasons for the aperture settings and took a series of photos until the sun rose. There wasn't the great colour of some dawns but that's just how it is some days. We then walked to the local temple where there were lots of monks and children playing as well as monkeys. We talked through some great shots which could only have happened because of Tom's local and technical knowledge. This continued all day with a break for breakfast. Finally at nearly three in the afternoon we returned to Siem Reap,exhausted. I had also used a 50mm lens for the first time and again achieved pleasing results. Thanks for a great day."

We didn't want a traditional guide, overloading us with historical details, dragging us from attraction to attraction with the masses. I chose Angkor Wat Photography because my friends and I have amateurish interest in photography, but mostly because we wanted to simply soak in the wonders and magic of Angkor Wat, peacefully and unhurriedly. Our guide Chris was incredibly knowledgeable and gave us 2 days of great balance - Angkor Wat at dawn (ok, no way around the crowds here, but a lot more manageable than I expected) and off the beaten path gems, where we were the only people wandering around ancient holy sites. He was highly attentive to our photography goals (though I didn't really have any), and as a result, we all got great pics.I highly recommend Angkor Wat Photograph if you want to experience Angkor Wat the way I did - MY way. :) I've even recommended it to friends who aren't shutterbugs."

I am an advanced photographer and they were still able to take me to places and show me stuff as well as show my g.f the sights in comfort (opt for the ac car). We did strike out for a sunset shot but oh well.Tom was a great guide and a nice guy. Took care of stuff and showed up on time (we had one late start because of the driver but it worked out fine in the end). He even helped me swim (with my gear) to a big rock for a better waterfall view!He is the one who recomended the Circus which was amazing!"

We opted for a private tour for 2 people, half day (about 6 hours), and it was the perfect length of time - not too short, but not too long so that we didn't get worn out. We started at dawn for the Angkor sunrise, and it didn't start getting hot until later in the morning (around 9). Even then, the weather wasn't too bad. Because it was the wet season the scenery was lush and green - everything really looked beautiful and dramatic.Our guide was Tom, and he was great. He was very knowledgeable and helpful, accommodating, patient and full of suggestions, but he never made us feel overwhelmed or incompetent in any way. He was a real natural at helping us feel comfortable with our camera and confident in taking photos. We are beginners and know only a little about photography, so his tutoring was invaluable. The camera we used was a Sony RX100, a good camera, but not DSLR - and we got some truly amazing photos while using it.The temples we visited were Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Bantey Kdei and Ta Nei. The first two were obvious must-sees, but the second two were just as lovely, and it's thanks to our guide's knowledge that we were able to know about these places. Ta Nei will always be a special temple to us because we were able to see gibbons in the wild, rather close up while we were there. It was the perfect ending to an awesome day. This company's tours are a great value, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone who has any sort of interest in taking photos as a keepsake for their time in Angkor."

The tour was well organized and we found good spots for pictures that you don't find on the ordinary tours (that we also went on another day). In addition he knew when to visit some of the most popular temples in order to avoid the crowds, and visited some of the more unknown temples that offer good photo opportunities. The guide was very pleasant and skilled. He made me challenge myself and shoot most shots in manual mode, a mode a did not use to much before this tour. In addition I got good tip for compositions and techniques. Even though I knew of most of them before the trip, it is so useful to have someone considerably more skilled that yourself giving good advise."

Two days before I visited Angkor with my family, and took some nice pictures. So I was a bit hesitant if it would pay of. But it did!We started of with the sunrise, and moved on through several temples. Tom knew some quite scenic spots. For the foto geeks: I use the A setting on my camera a lot, but he tough me to also use the M setting. Furthermore shoot in black and white for some more drama and sometimes underexposure is a good thing.To top of this morning: we saw three Gibbons playing in the trees. One of them came really close. You rarely see them anymore! Lucky us!Thanks Tom for enhancing my skill a bit further!"

It was exciting personally for me as it involved lots of walking (sometimes hiking), visiting secret doors and small neglected temples besides the great Angkor wat and bayon temple which everybody visited. I felt privileged to be able to see the temples in different frames as Tom (our mentor) instructed us to. Tom seems genuinely passionate about photography and I felt he was very eager to share with us his skills. Capturing local fishermen fishing and the visit to killing field exhibition was an added pleasure. Thanks Angkor Wat Photography workshops and tours team and esp. Tom for making my day in Cambodia special and fruitful. I personally learned a lot about photography and camera at the end of the trip.I will definitely visit Angkor wat complex again and maybe join one of the tours again. I will recommend my friends to do the same. Best wishesSonam (Bhutan)"

Still of course it was great to go through the second part for the temples seeing.I only feel sad to miss the sunrise, as i did not get a lot of photos with vibrant colors before or at the sunrise.

Angkor Wat Photography tailored a day long tour for me that catered to my interests in photography; taking me from the temples, to places for great candid street photography shots, and even out to the countryside!

It wasn\u2019t supposed to be a private tour but we were the only people who had signed up for the day to it kind of was. There were some people at Angkor Wat early in the morning but not too many so we fit there nicely. We set up our camera inside the walls near a pond and our guide told us about the settings to use to get a great photo. Good thing I had also brought a tripod.After the sun had come up we moved in further taking a route following the outside of the central area before going to the center. Our guide told us about the temple and gave tips about good angles and details to photograph.We exited from the back and got to our tuk-tuk. Before lunch we also visited Ta Prohm, Banteay Kdei and Ta Nei. Our guide was of course telling us about how old each of them was etc. but kinda hard to remember afterwards. Since it was just us we took a lunch break around noon for two hours, took a refreshing shower and a rest back at the hotel. At two we continued and took a fairly long ride to Preah Khan, Angkor Thom and finally Bayon. With fewer destinations in the afternoon it was maybe a little bit easier to follow what was going on, but mostly just stones in temple form or pile form.The tour ended around 5 pm so in total in was a twelve-hour thing. Without a proper break at lunch it would have been too much but now it was bearable, the heat was very tiring and some of the temples had some steps to climb too. The price of the tour was 79 USD which isn\u2019t cheap but then again it was long and compared to \u201cnormal\u201d tours we also got some good photos and good tips on how to take good photos in general.

And shooting in Manual has never felt better! Perspective and composition is also encouraged in tutoring in an easy way to understand.If you want great looking photos and improved skills while appreciating Angkor this is the one!

Wear comfortable walking shoes. In hot and dry season like we encountered during March 2014, please wear comfortable summer clothing but respectful of temples, a towel and drinking water.Best of wishes to you guys joining this tour, it changed my photographing experience a lot.

We could hear the voices of the crowds but where we were the birds were louder. The odd encounter with a tour group made us doubly grateful to be avoiding the crowds. We saw so much and had lots of help and advice about using our cameras, best angles, most interesting shots, etc. Apart from Chris, there were three of us on the group tour and we were soon all good friends. I have been recommending this tour to all and sundry on my way around Vietnam as so many were heading to Siem Reap."

The contact with Matthias was prompt, efficient and most of all, flexible to our needs.We were assigned to Darren for the day and were very pleased with how it all went. We had opted to miss sunrise and start at 730am. We went to Ta Prohm first and Darren helped us find the best spots away from the tour groups. We covered 6 temples in total and also did some street photography in a local market.Darren helped us interact with the locals to get the best photos. We were impressed with his technical knowledge and he certainly made the most of our short time by finding the best locations.The end of the day spent watching the sunset from the top of Bakong was pure magic. This was also our favourite temple as we had a chance to meet some young monks in the nearby temple grounds.It could not have been better and although it was a long and tiring day we were very glad to have done it. It really does help you make the most of your short time in Siem Reap. As for the photos, they are still being processed and we will post some highlights on our mcternans.com travel blog very soon. Hopefully we will have some worthy ones. Thank you Darren, Matthias and our patient driver."

Otto was very nice and knowledgeable, thanks!

The site says that the tour is focused on photography but not meant to teach about history/culture but we had it all. Our guide Ota was perhaps the best guide we could have dreamed of. He was so knowledgeable about photography (used to be a photo-journalist) and knew all the great spots even in the crazy crowds. But in addition, he was also knowledgeable about the history and cultural significance of the sites which was a fantastic addition. Our pictures were great and our experience was fantastic. I couldn't have asked for more. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in photography while in Angkor wat. If I had more time in Siem Reap I would do another tour with this organization."

He knew where to go for the best light conditions during the day. At our last site of the day we were the only people there, and it felt very special.And what a destination to do a photography course.

I liked how Chris related the core elements of photography - shutter speed, aperture size, ISO, white balance, focal length, etc. - to the specific subject. He knew where, when and how to capture the temples' most photogenic shots. It was a small group, just myself and a very nice British couple on holiday from Dubai. Extremely knowledgeable in both photography and the Angkor Wat temple complex, you cant' go wrong with Chris on this tour. You will learn loads from Chris, irrespective of your level of experience.

We got to see part of the temple that we would never have seen on our own and Ota was so good at encouraging me to try to get better photos he also explained what I was doing wrong how to focus better. I just wish I had longer in Siem Reap as I would definitely have done another tour with Ota.

He knew the way to the quiet, picturesque areas of the temples like the back of his hand. Chris was such a wonderful and inspiring guide that I learnt lots technically in a day that I had in other workshops and I enjoyed every bit of it. I learnt to look out for photo opportunities in different situations and picked up great tips on lighting, composition and perspectives from Chris. He helped me discover what an awesome tool I had with my new 7D Mk II with functions that I did\u2019nt know earlier of!

He is a Brit who speaks perfect English and knows some rudimentary Cambodian so he's a big help with drivers. Chris showed up on time both days and was not only a wealth of info about photography, but also was a wealth of info about the temples and their history. Since we didn't book an official \"temple guide\", we didn't feel as if we missed out opting just for the photography tour. If you're interested in photography, I highly recommend this tour as Chris knew which temples to hit at what time of day in order to get the best light for your photos, and avoid the inevitable tour busses that showed up everywhere.Thank you Matthias and Chris for a great two days of sightseeing and shooting!!!!"

My wife and I took the tour, led by Chris who was a pleasure to spend the day with - a very pleasant, very knowledgeable and helpful guy who managed to get me using manual mode permanently now so that was worth the trip in itself!This is a very well organized tour led by experienced guides and there is no way we would have discovered the hidden temples or found similar photo locations on our own with only 1 day available to explore. Pickup was at 4.30am where we headed off for the ticket to the Angkor complex and hiked over to the main Angkor temple to take pictures of the rising sun behind it - amazing way to start the day and the atmosphere was very cool. We had arranged a return to the hotel for a break from the midday sun which was perfect, got us out of the heat at a time when the light wasn't the best for photos anyway. It did not detract from the tour at all, in fact I'd recommend it. During the planning, Matthias was very responsive and very helpful and had arranged to hire me a tripod and wide angle lens suitable for canon at a very reasonable price (which I would fully recommend if like me you don't own one - makes all the difference to the photos you can achieve). The areas we visited were Angkor Wat, Banteay Kdei, Ta Prohm, Ta Nei, Angkor Thom (The Elephant Terrace, The Leper Terrace, The Royal Palace), Preah Khan, and The Bayon temples.Without doubt we have some absolutely incredible photos which are well worth putting up on our walls and we would not have got these without Chris and Angkor Wat Photography Workhop and Tours. The only negative was that we were both very sad to be leaving Siem Reap and extremely disappointed we didn't give ourselves more time to take in more (a full week would have been perfect).One of the best tours I've ever done."

Now about photography, well R\u00e9gis BINARD is indeed a nice guy and we\u2019ve spent a great day with him! More important than that is that he is a very good photographer, he really knows what he\u2019s doing and teaching you! I\u2019ve learned a lot of small techniques to take a picture which is just a little better than the average holiday picture, but this makes me look differently at my pictures from before and the pictures I took since then (in Khao Lak and Bangkok, sunset on the Wat Arun etc...) are way better then what I did before... So thank you R\u00e9gis!Another great point to the day was, even if I had only a small Canon, R\u00e9gis never acted as if he was the important guy with the expensive material, looking down to our equipment, au contraire, he was quite amazed of some of the features, on the other hand, while discussing techniques we also discovered some of the limits of my camera and he even tried to find a solution to work around the problem and still take great shots!Again, a big BRAVO for his knowledge and his approach! If you have some money to spent on a privat tour - this is the one to book!Thank you for the day!"

You can't beat having knowledgeable guides who know where to be at the time the light is just right and who can help you capture the images you envision. Chris Cusick was our host and he was absolutely marvelous! There are many positive reviews about this company, but I think I have a unique story. When I made the arrangements with Angor Wat Photography I indicated my wife was an extreme novice and would be using a point and shoot camera. What I should have relayed was that she had probably not taken more than a couple hundred pictures in her entire life. She has always been very supportive of my photography hobby, but not wanted to be involved with it herself. That is until Chris worked with her. Chris was a great teacher for her. He introduced her to good composition, explaining what images were good, which ones could be improved, and how to do it. He sensed very early in the day that she did not want to be encumbered with settings and dials, but enjoy the experience of trying to capture scenes through images that she would want to share with family and friends. She learned more in the one day with Chris, than she ever could by reading or attending classes, even if she had been so inclined. Following Siem Reap, we went to Myanmar for ten days. Janet was in heaven. She practiced the things Chris had taught her and sought my advice on others. We had an entire new topic to discuss over dinners. When we reviewed our day's images in the evening, she was surprised at how good some of them were and was so excited that she wanted to share them with our children immediately. She created some wonderful images; indeed in may locations, her images were far better than mine because she has a natural photographer's eye, a gift I envy. Chris was the ultimate teacher, and I have him to thank for giving my wife and I a new activity that we will enjoy together for the rest of our lives and make our travels together even more special. The only downside to all this is I had to buy my wife a new DSLR, so she could continue her development---best money I ever spent!I should also mention that I learned an enormous amount from Chris as well. When I looked at the images I made the first day vs. images created the rest of our trip, there was night an day differences."

Not only about my camera, but also about the complex. We took beautiful pictures and we had a wonderful day. It made my wife buy an additional camera body, so we can now enjoy photography together!

Our guide - Ota - was extremely knowledgeable, personable and fun. He brought some of the history to life for us in his stories and information as well as through the shots we were taking. He offered great advise and instruction without it feeling 'like a lesson'. He also managed to navigate us to some great spots and avoid some of the larger crowds. Matthias was also extremely responsive and helpful as we planned the trip. Highly recommended."

We shot in some great locations near the old market area and practiced long exposures, light painting, and panning. He spent time with each person in our small group and was an excellent instructor -- I learned a lot during this tour and would highly recommend it even for more experienced photographers. I walked away with some really great photos of Siem Reap. I had a great time and wish I had booked one of the full day temple photo trips. I will definitely do this next time I am in Cambodia. If you enjoy photography and want to sharpen your skills while exploring a beautiful area of the world, do yourself a favor and book Angkor Wat Photography Workshops."

We had a great day and learned so much about the camera we've had for a few years, but only ever used on manual. Regis was adept at dodging crowds, and we saw a water blessing we would definitely not have seen by ourselves. We have some great shots to remember our trip. If you have time, I would recommend getting a 3 day temple pass. This will give you a chance to go back to learn more of the history, which was not a big focus of our tour, and also to practice your new photography skills. Highly recommended even for total amateurs!"

I planned to do the one-day tour but was concerned that the amount of walking at the various sites would be an issue for my 81 year old mother. I needn't have worried because Ota was a true gentleman offering help and support throughout. More importantly he tailored the day to suit our requirements perfectly. From a history point of view Ota is 'full bottle' on all the sites, having worked with various archaeological groups and that made it perfect for my mum. I am a keen photographer, but a bit hesitant at times, Ota shared his experiences and ideas and I walked away at the end of the day learning some things about my camera that I hadn't used before. The day was such a success that I booked an additional half day, and that surpassed our expectations even further. I learnt alot from Ota from a skill perspective as well as different ways of interpreting different perspectives that you come across at the various sites. We both came away richer for the experience making it a highlight of our week in Siem Reap. I will return someday and I look for to going to the next level with Ota. Matthias brought it altogether by providing all the information we needed prior to and during the week we were here. He runs a slick operation and will continue to do well with photographers like Ota and his team.All the best, Andrew & Jenny"

His knowledge of photography is top notch and I feel confident he could help people of all levels improve on their skills. He has an amazing eye. My husband and I enjoyed soaking in as much knowledge as we could. Chris was also great at avoiding the crowds and visiting some less crowded temples to get some amazing photos. Our tour started at 4:40 am and we were dropped off at our hotel around 5:30 pm. It was a great day!Matthias, the owner, was very quick to respond to my emails arranging the tour. He sent a confirmation email with all the information we needed to know the day before. We were able to rent tripods from him and he arranged for tuk-tuk transportation. We were also offered a car if we preferred. All in all, an amazing experience and something we will continue to use even after this tour. It was money well spent!"

My husband is the chief photographer and he said that he learned an incredible amount from our day out with Darren. He took us to all the quieter areas at each of the temples by picking the right times to go to each one. He also showed us where to stand to get really good photos and he knew at each of the temples where the good photographic opportunities were. He also took us to a wonderful spot for breakfast and another one for lunch. The food was great and the people obviously really liked him as he treated everyone with warmth and respect.

Comparing my photos taken with Regis against the ones I took the day before, I could see a big advancement. And I was particularly happy with the photos I took at the water blessing at the pagoda. The water just hangs in the air! I had a new bridge camera that I didn't really know how to use, and my partner had a fully digital SLR - his technical expertise was always better than mine, but he learnt many new things too.

Just to give you some perspective on where my review is coming from, I would consider myself an amateur photographer. I have a Nikon D7000 and shoot mostly on manual settings. I have a few filters, a tripod and one additional lens. Most of my experience has been with landscape photography. With that being said, Regis very quickly learned my skill level and adjusted his teachings and suggestions to help me get the most out of my camera. I felt like both my technical ability and my eye were improved after spending a day wandering the temples. Regis offered advice on things to shoot, how to work with the light we had and how to see the scenery in a different perspective. However, he also encouraged us to search for our own shots and offered advice or compliments based on whatever pictures we offered for review. Above all, he was friendly and encouraging and I found the whole experience educational.Obviously Angkor has a lot to offer in the way of landscape, but we also photographed a young child playing in the river, Monks praying and offering a water blessing and several of the resident monkeys, giving us some experience with portraits and action shots. Keep in mind that this is not a tour to see every temple in the complex or to learn the entire history behind the temples. Regis offered some insight to history when he knew it and sometimes would ask the other guides in the area when he really wanted to know the answer to something, but his real talent was in finding the most aesthetic and interesting areas that Angkor has to offer all while avoiding crowds and making the most of the light.As far as logistics go, the tour company offered transportation to and from the complex and our hotel. They provided an extra tripod when requested ahead of time and plenty of water through the day. You will have to purchase your own ticket to the complex ~$20 for one day or $40 for 3. We also decided to go from sunset until about noon, then return again from 2 until sunset. This worked out very well as it gave us a little time to find lunch and refresh during the middle of the day when it is hot in the temples and the lighting is harsh anyway. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone wanting to explore the temple complex from a photographer's perspective and hopefully improve upon their own skills."

The villages were all so friendly and happy for me to not only take photos, but also try what they were doing. After lunch China was able to find somewhere for me to do a water blessing which was so much fun!! Then we did two temples, Ota was able to show me the best spots to take photos and explain some history about the temple. My knowledge of my camera has improved so much, can't wait to see the photos on the computer. I was lucky enough that Ota used my camera in the morning, and in the afternoon we changed cameras so I could learn about the setting on my camera.

I wanted to have a deeper insight into photo shooting (by the way, it's just a hobby for me). And we were both satisfied at the end.Our guide was Ota, a nice helpful knowledgeable person, and we really enjoyed his pleasant and patient company. He had to rearrange the itinerary because Tonle Sap was not available that day and he found a very interesting alternative. He took us to markets, monasteries (one was located in the middle of nowhere, an amazing surreal peaceful place I could have never visited under different circumstances) and also gave us some info that only a person that lives in a place and loves it can give you. Priceless.So, I managed to learn some techniques about photoshooting. I learned more in that day that in the 3 years that I've been owning my camera.

Angkor Wat Photography Workshops and Tours was a perfect idea to maximize time and navigate the out of the usual tourist locations. Erik, did a fabulous job of explaining tourist patterns and how to avoid them to get wonderful and non typical photographs. Erik's local knowledge and a bit of language skills was invaluable. Thanks for making the trip exceptional!"

The Night Tour focused on the area around the Night Market & was a great evening activity. Since it is focused around the Night Market area there is not a ton of walking involved (though your on your feet the whole time of course) so even if you have spend all day walking around the temples your feet should be able to handle it:) Your focus is mainly playing around with shutter speed & how it effects your image. The next day we did the Tour of Tonie Sap Lake & I loved it! It was crazy how much I was able to learn from Regis in one day! I left with a much better understanding of aperture & depth of field because Regis was able to give me instant feedback on my photos & the time to try the same shot again changing the aperture & seeing the difference it made instantly. We visited some temples in the morning as well as the local market which was fun. We had lunch then headed for the lake. We even visited the school in the village which was enjoyable to me as a teacher myself. I started the day a bit uncomfortable with photographing random strangers but Regis spoke with the locals for me & assured me no one minded, which helped me really enjoy/become comfortable with it. I was able to use the skills I learned that day throughout the rest of my trip. Take as many tours as your schedule will allow with Angkor Wat Photography. They will tailor their instruction to your skill level & you will learn so much."

Besides that, of course, he will also provide you with the technical background on your camera settings and with useful tips on how to improve your pictures.

He is both a great teacher as well as photographer. My own photographs were significally more interesting compositionally, and the images he took were just incredible.

His knowledge of where to go and at what time of the day was superb and I learnt a lot about composition, and experimented with HDR images, which I had not tried before. I was unfortunate to have a problem with my camera after the first day, and they were great in offering advice and allowing me to borrow a camera so I could still take more photos. A great couple of days with good tuition. Would definitely recommend to other keen photographers."

For my second trip to Angkor Wat (the first was in 2004) I wanted to take really memorable, powerful or maybe even exhibition quality photographs, as opposed to just souvenir shots. After much research I decided on Angkor Wat Photography Tours. My many e-mail enquiries were handled promptly and professionally. I engaged their Personal Photographer Tour services for Angkor Wat and Tonle Sap Lake.My guide was Erik for both days. He was very knowledgeable about the temple and lake subject matters, passionate about photography and very professional as a guide. We discovered that we had many favourite subjects in common. He was much more than a guide; he became a friend and mentor.Engaging a photo tour guide is much much more than being told where to stand and how to frame the shot. Erik showed mastery of working the light, how to engage with the locals and of course \u201creading\u201d the needs of the client and exceeding expectations.Thank you for the 2 amazing photo tours, Erik!"

Our driver who was a monk at one time took us to pagodas and Buddhist temples where there was not a single tourist! We were able to take our time looking around the buildings with Regis who was very patient with my wife. We were also able to take some photos with a monk who offered us a blessing in his house. What a treat!After lunch, we made our way to Tonle Sap Lake and the floating villages. Once again, another pleasant surprise as Regis knew someone who lived in the village (not a tourist attraction) and we got to meet the local people, take photos with the kids and even play some volleyball. While the floating villages were beautiful, I would say taking portraits of the locals was the highlight of this tour. I only have good things to say about Angkor Wat Photography as they were responsive to (last minute) emails, offer friendly tour guides (who knew the city) and timely services. I would recommend their service to anyone from professionals to amateurs as my wife picked up the T3I for the very first time. Thank you Regis and Angkor Wat Photography for an awesome time in Siem Reap!"

It was a great experience that went far beyond my expectations and was worth any penny. I am an experienced photographer who mostly does portraiture, so I asked Ota to avoid temples and architecture to focus on local people. He was very good in meeting my needs and escorted me in what I would define as the \"perfect\" tours. The first day, we first visited the old market in Siem Reap. Then, we did a tour around the rural areas surrounding the temples, where we entered local people's houses to chat with (and taking photos of) them. It was a great occasion to take unconventional portraits and a touching experience as well. Then we went to the Tonle Sap lake to visit the floating village of Kampong Phluk, which, photographically speaking, was a great source of inspiration. The second day I did a half-day tour to visit the Preah daek area and a meditation temple. Once again, it was a remarkable experience. Ota is a great guide and taught me a lot on how to deal with people for taking street portraits. He has a deep knowledge of Cambodia and shared a huge amount of interesting and useful information and details about Cambodian people's way of living (and thinking). I definitely feel enriched after these days with Ota and look forward to experiencing further, new tours, with him the next time I will be in Siem Reap. Thank you!"

This was really such a fantastic day in visiting one of the great wonders of the world with such an experienced photographer to help from dawn to dusk.Our instructor Ota spoke excellent English, arrived at our hotel punctually with a driver.Everything throughout the day went so smoothly. He tailored it to our needs so breakfast and lunch was at most appropriate times in the park. The driver provided cool bottled water during the day and was ready to go every time when off to another temple. Despite being a keen amateur photographer with a full frame DSLR I still learnt some really useful tips from Ota. In addition he took us to places that others did not seem to go to also ended up producing excellent images.Of course, we went to the main sites and we can NOT control the weather so if lots of clouds for sunrise then we still learnt of HDR and other techniques and composition to produce some stunning shots.I was initially worried by my son becoming bored or too tired by lunchtime BUT I was proved completely wrong. My son learnt so much using a hired Canon 7D+tripod and with Ota's interesting stories about each temple, the culture and interpretations of the pictures carved into the stones we were fully engaged and absorbing so so much. We both felt entirely safe with Ota.He clearly demonstrated his great experience in handling Canon DSLRs and an extensive knowledge of the park and surrounding areas' archaeology.This tour was booked direct via e-mail exchange prior to travelling to Cambodia."

As we continued on our day Ota was most helpful and friendly in his approach to helping us produce the best shots we could. Even giving us helpful tips along the way. He showed us lots of useful ways to gain more from our cameras and shots. We all enjoyed a well earned lunch break and a quick down poor of rain before we set off again.

In the end Ota was a perfect guide for our day giving us just the right amount of background information about the temples which helped inspire us as well as his great expertise in photography.

While I got some tips on composition, it was largely what the pro photographer wanted to take shots of, not necessarily what I was interested in. I like to use full manual mode and take my time to get the exposure to my liking, but again I was discouraged from using manual in favour of aperture priority - I guess it's not too much of a drama, but when you are framing most shots on a tripod, manual can easily be used. I think this would be very good for someone who is using their DSLR (or SLR) in an auto mode and wants to take the next step towards controlling the outcome of the exposure."

I was looking to balance the interest of my oldest child (a very keen photographer) with also travelling with two very young children not up to hours exploring temples, and happily I found Matthias and Ota!From the first, everything about the tour was easy to arrange. Matthias corresponded with me in the weeks leading up to our arrival, helping us to settle on a tour my daughter could attend. Unfortunately her first choice of the Kulen tour was not running while we were in Siem Reap, and Matthias offered us both the Angkor tour (12 hours from pre dawn to sunset) and the Tonle Sap tour. If my daughter hadn't been so tired from the first, she would certainly have done both tours, but on this occasion they were running on consecutive days.I was a bit worried about sending my 17 year od by herself in a new country, but Ota took excellent car of her. She returned not only with 100's of photos she is very proud of, an email with notes Ota took for her to help improve her photography skills, she returned more confident in venturing out 'by herself', with lots of stories about bargaining, the language and the local area. This was an experience that will stay with her and has also helped her in the big adventure of growing all the way up - thank you very much to Matthias, Ota and your driver!"

Thanks Laurent for introducing me to time lapse photography. I bought a Gopro in Hong Kong and now spend time photographing short videos. We arrived in Siem Reap as part of a cycling tour which included some temple visits. This meant some overlapping.

He taught us the basic of photography in an easy to use and remember way. We even bought a camera using his advice( since we rented their DSL camera for the tour). We went around Angkor Wat Park to popular and less known places in an order that beat the crowds. In the afternoon, due to the heavy rain, we went to an indoor market and worked on action shots. It was amazing!! We used what we learned on this trip for the rest of our trip. Thank you George!"

George, our guide is incredibly knowledgable about the best spots for photography in Angkor temples. He taught us how to dramatically improve our photography in a patient and interesting way. It was great to learn a new skill in such a wonderful setting! Having a guide that knows how to avoid crowds, make the most of the beautiful weather, teach effectively and give snippets of historical information was fantastic. George was able to teach across all different levels of ability and with SLRs and compacts. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone interested in improving their photography skills!"

It started at sunrise at Angkor Wat, and didn't finish until I was dropped back at my hotel at 5:30pm. We visited all the major temples, and some much quieter but no less impressive ones. The best part is really getting shown the most effective places to take shots, and how to improve on your skill level. I came away having learnt so much, not only about photography, but also about the area and the people.If you only have the chance to do one thing in Siem Reap, make sure it's this. It is truly the best way to see the temples, and create some lasting memories."

The tour started early so we could snap some photos of the sun rising over Angkor Wat. We then visited many more temples for the next 12 hours. We went in an order than minimized the amount of tourists at the most popular spots and maximized the natural lighting so we could take better photos. We also explored some less visited temples that were stunning in their own right. We received excellent instruction on how to improve our pictures with our DSLRs. These tips dramatically improved the photos we took for the rest of our trip. I highly recommend Thomas for both the tour and the tips."

I thought why not kill two birds with one stone, and get to know about the Angkor city and temples while finally learning how to use my DSLR! Thomas our guide and guru was an excellent host, giving us photo tips along the way both technical and creative. Being a veteran of the Angkor, he is very familiar with the temple grounds and knows where the best photo spots are in this overly vast compound that is impossible to cover in one day. On top of the camera business, we learned so much from Thomas about Siem Reap, its people, history and culture. I am glad we did this photowalk on our first day in Siem Reap, as it opened our eyes to many things to expect and get excited over throughout the duration of our stay. The workshop is also tailored to suit your pace and proficiency with the camera so for us it was a fun walk in the park all the way. I would recommend you do a private tour so you can really take your time with what you want to see and capture throughout the tour. The temples alone are magnificent and simply awe-inspiring, put Thomas into the equation, and you never have a dull moment!"

I did a solo trip and really enjoyed it. Photography has been a hobby for about 20 years but for Thomas it is a career so he was able to fill in all sorts of gaps in my knowledge, advise me on composition, etc. Very useful. He also knows the area well and throughout the day we flexibly adjusted the schedule to avoid crowds and take advantage of the day. My advice is to research as much as you can and even have specific photos in mind that you want to emulate. He will tell you what is possible given the seasons, your equipment, distance between temples, etc."

I wanted some decent one to one tuition, both technical and creative, so that I could walk away with some great images of Angkor - and was not disappointed. I spent about 11 hours with Thomas, early morning and all afternoon at the temples, some time at the market and with street photography techniques, and a couple of hours on processing. This is a lot of time with a professional photographer, and for very little cash. I learned a bit more about customising camera settings (I've only had my second DSLR a year!)I picked up some good tips on how to take images of the Angkor temples in challenging light conditions (there is often a lot of shade lower down in the temples)He showed me some spots and viewpoints that I didn't know I learned a lot about LIghtroom, and turning a decent shot into a great oneI picked up some new techniques and strategies for street photographyI learned about extended exposure times and more about HDRI walked away with some great imagesMoney well spent.

I visited Siem Reap in March 2012 with family and friends and since then I always wanted to go back to have more time to spend for photography. I came across Angkor Wat Photography Tours online and contacted Thomas by email. He replied to my emails promptly and answered all my questions. I travelled on my own so I wanted to be sure that everything was well organized. I booked a private tour and Thomas put an interesting itinerary together. During the three days I learned a lot and improved my understanding for shutter speed, aperture, exposure, composition, editing in Lightroom and much more. Thomas is fun to talk to, very knowledgeable, patient and tries to keep his explanations as simple as possible. Thanks to Thomas I discovered so many new buttons and functions on my Nikon D90 :-). If you want to improve your photography skills in one of the most beautiful spots in Southeast Asia with somebody who knows exactly where to go to take the perfect shots - don't look any further. These tours are just perfect! Thank you Thomas."

Mr Thomas taught me the basic relationship among ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed, apart from various settings available with the camera.

On top of being a good teacher on photography, I also appreciated talking with Mr Thomas about the local way of lives, from a foreigner's perspective.

This photography tour has taken my pictures to a new level, and to top it all, mr Thomas is a real friendly person and extremely knowledeable about many things related to camera, post processing, filters and lighting. Tour started with a sunrise in Angkor, here mr.Thomas took me to a much better spot than the crowded usual spot and taught me a lot about long time exposure. The result is brilliant. After a much needed coffee break, we head on to Ta Phrom. This temple is breathlessly amazing. The trees are great point of interest in the pictures. Here, Thomas guided me to enable me to take good angle and to deal with shadows in the pictures. Later on during post processing Thomas taught me how to reduce the exposure of the shadows. A much appreciated skills that I learned from Thomas.Bantaey Kdei temple has great pictures from the front or back side. This temple is a bit easier to take pictures because less tourist are here. Don't miss the great big white tree in the middle of the temple. One of the most dramatic pictures I got was from this tree. (with IR camera)Bayon temple has one of the most interesting view of hundreds of smiling statues. Here Thomas taught me again how to take a perfect angle and line up the faces to make an interesting composition. We stopped by a lake (?) and experimented with ND filters and long exposures to make the lake smooth. And also to a river to take a pictures of water mill, again with long exposures. During these whole day tour, Thomas constantly look at my angles, composition, lighting and giving me advice how to get a better result. During night tour, Thomas taught me about street photography, panning, long time exposures and light paintings. We went to the old market and going around to see the traditional wet market and to clear out the people in a busy street. It was extremely interesting to see the results.Tonle sap sunset was another fantastic tour. Here we took pictures of houses on stilts and bright red sun disappearing on the horizon. When I went home, I was extremely impressed with the pictures I took. I know I wouldn't be able to take those kind of pictures without Thomas' advices. Some pictures are even worth printing and displaying on the wall. After all, you paid a lot of money just to be in Siem Reap, why not take the right souvenir home? The one that you can be proud of answering when someone ask : who took that picture?"

Two of my favorite things and the Sunrise Photography tour offered by Thomas (owner/instructor) did not disappoint. In fact, it surpassed my expectations and offered more. I'm an amateur photographer who've always wanted to learn how to take great travel photos but because of my limited knowledge on how to use my DSLR camera, I always end up with so-so photos. Thanks to Thomas' simple & non-intimidating instructions, he taught me techniques, such as framing, understanding depth of field, taking pictures inside dark rooms, of moving subjects, from different angles & much more. Techniques which I'll never learn from just reading books, browsing the internet, or figuring out my camera on my own. His personal, one-on-one teaching helped me understand the importance of controlling light using the \"A\" (aperture) setting. I'm the kind of person who doesn't believe on splurging on expensive gadgets in order to take great photos, so Thomas' tips helped me decide which few necessary accessories to buy. The best part of it all is that I learned photography while enjoying the sites of Angkor Wat temples. If you're planning to go to see Angkor Wat, make sure to plan your trip by taking one of Thomas' tours on your first day of visit. I guarantee you'll go home with a lot of new photography skills and amazing pictures."

During my recent trip to Cambodia I did the Tonle Sap lake tour with Thomas from Angkor Wat Photography (he is the owner and tour guide). And there are 3 things that I really want to highlight when it comes to Angkor Wat Photography Workshops and Tours. First, Thomas knows about anything you want to know about a DSLR camera. There is not a single subject he is not aware of and he really knows how to teach. When he explains things it is really easy to understand. Second, Thomas explained and showed us the use of additional equipments such as filters. I was really not aware about the qualities a polarizing filter or a gradient filter has. Our pictures really stand out from our regular holiday pictures. Third, the trip as such is wonderful. We stopped at some great places, we had the chance to meet local people and we finally ended up taking amazing pictures from the sunset at the lake.Because we liked the tour so much we booked another tour with Thomas. The Siem Reap Night Tour. We learned how to get high quality shots in low light conditions and we learned a lot about light painting with a flashlight and an off camera flash.

Fantastic English speaking tour guide who has much knowledge about his country and its treasures, and a great sense of humour too. Our group of 22 love him and we learned so much from him. He is now a dear friend and made our experience so much better! He even organised my birthday whilst out there! He's a great guy with lots of stories to share with you, highly recommended to anyone who would like to see the hidden gems that Cambodia has to offer. Arkoun Sopheara!"

I have been involved with organising trips to Cambodia for University students for 6 years and each year Sopheara has been our guide. His spoken English is exceptional and with his educational background in history he is so very informative about his country and the culture/heritage within - he has recently graduated from University! He is a very kind and generous man who always makes sure my students are well looked after and have the best experience whilst in Siem Reap. Sopheara has a very entertaining manner about him and he makes every trip fun and certainly memorable. Although I have generally been involved with taking large groups (20students + ) I have friends who have used Sopheara both individually and in couples and the feedback is just the same - \"he's the most knowledgable, lovely and funny guide you could meet\" - I would most certainly recommend Sopheara for your time in Siem Reap."

We communicated with him through Facebook and helped us which tours we should do and let him know our budget. We did the 3 day tour with him on a private car (I highly recommend this as it gets really hot). He knew so much of the Cambodian history and makes you feel like you are back in time! He will take you to places where the most tourists can't go since we are in a private tour. He knew where to go and what time so it isn't overly crowded.What made our tour so pleasant (aside from the history and seeing the temples) was Sopheara! He was so nice and charming and was so easy to get along with. He's got an eye for taking photos as well!I highly recommend booking with Sopheara when doing the day tours. Amazing time we had with him! We will definitely be back with friends :)"

I always knew that my trip to Siem Reap and Cambodia was going to be an amazing trip but it was honestly\u00a0one of my favourite travel experiences of all time! I can only think of my trip to Egypt that equally stirred as much wonder. The grand ancient history and the spectacular ancient architecture of this region is amongst the most impressive in the world. What more could I ask for another than the very best personal guided experience I have ever had by Sopheara Pheav. In my opinion you would be crazy not to engage his tour services should you be thinking of visiting Cambodia. His vast historical knowledge of the people and temples will fascinate you as he cleverly avoids the crowds. With his passion for the past and frank understanding of the Cambodian present, it was impossible for me not to feel a real connection with Sopheara. One of great respect and admiration. I only wish I had time to get to know him better and I really do hope to see him again in the future. Above and beyond his charm and knowledge he has a natural talent of photography. He understands how to use the iPhone camera in creative ways that will give you incredible images of your unforgettable tour experience."

The schedule he had set-out didn't work because it was more crowded in the morning than he originally thought it would be. Once we worked things out and moved it around (and got some food), he relaxed, we relaxed, and everything was much better. He was funny, interesting, and spoke wonderful English. He also managed to avoid the crowds at the smaller temples (impossible to avoid crowds at Angkor Wat), and even did some Indiana-Jones-like climbing to get us to areas others could not go. It was awesome.The van is comfortable and the driver was extremely nice. Water provided the entire day, which was great."

We booked a official tour guide through the hotel and a tuk tuk for the days. The picked us up a 5.00 in the morning and took us to buy tickets and then we went on the \"small\" tour. We started the tour at sunrise at the Angkor Wat. Don't do that. There are thousands of people and it is too crowed. Instead you should go the opposite route and ask your guide to go against the tide of people. Our guide spoke really bad English and that ruined our experience at the Angkor. Therefore check out your guide the day before - ask to meet him - to make sure you can communicate with him. We paid 75 usd + 40 usd for entrance for the whole day, but we only used until 13.00."

I was amazed by his high level of knowledge of Cambodian history and culture, as well as his constant enthusiasm and energy. It can be pretty tiring and stressful walking around under the Cambodian heat, and it can be very easy to reach the point of just wanting to go back to your air-con room. However, thanks to Sopheara enthusiasm, every excursion was an incredible adventure, filled with useful information and funny facts, which made the trip even more incredible! He organized visits to the Angkor Temples, the Floating Village, the Cultural Village, the Killing Fields Shrine, the temples and waterfalls on Kulen Mountains, the Landmine Museum, and much more. He also went out of his way to take us to the Phare Circus, and to take part to the celebrations of Cambodian New Year, as well as always being available to provide suggestions on where to go, and what to do, during our free time. I have been on guided tours in the past, and it is very easy to get an ordinary, boring guide that simply repeat memorized information about the place you're visiting, and I was stunned by the level of passion that Sopheara showed every single day.It is unbelievable how much I have learnt during the short time I have spent in Siem Reap, and I cannot thank Sopheara enough for it! I highly recommend Sopheara as a tour guide to anyone who's looking for a true Cambodian experience, you will not be disappointed! Thank you again Sopheara for everything you've done for us for the past two weeks, I cannot wait to come back again!"

The nice thing about Mr. Sopheara is that he will write you back personally. I went ahead and agreed to have him be my tour guide, and he said I could pay at the end of the trip. The main thing that prevents me from giving him an Excellent review is that he was not able to be my tour guide for the full three days. Prior to arriving to Cambodia, Mr. Sopheara told me that he could not be my guide for the first two days because of a business trip/training that he had to attend. He told me that he would have another guide that works with him give me the tour those days. I didn't think much of it at the time and agreed to continue through. The first two days, my guide was very pleasant person, however it was a bit difficult understanding his English. He also was not as engaged and excited while giving the tours. Maybe it was burnout from work? These guides are constantly giving tours all the time in the hot sun. He was, however, a great photographer and took many awesome pictures of me at the temples. The third day, I had Sopheara as my guide, and he was very engaging, knowledgable, and humorous. He even gave me a personal tour climbing over the ruins of Beng Malea - going to places in the ruins that many tourists are not taken. Both of them knew the history of the temples very well. Overall, I think Sopheara is a great choice for a tour guide, but I would make sure he can give you the tours each day you are there - at the end of my tour, I was wishing he had been with me all three days. My only other complaint is that I believe I contracted food poisoning from the last restaurant he dropped me off at on my last day of the tour because I had diarrhea that followed me throughout the rest of my South East Asia trip :("

Even better, he knows the best places for you to take pictures of the temples or countryside. He can take excellent photos of you as well. He LOVES the temple sites and their carvings. His enthusiasm makes visits very, very satisfying. I've never experienced anything like it anywhere else! Sopheara has a great sense of humour and knows how to pace visits beautifully. Take good walking shoes and sunscreen. He supplies all the cold drinking water you need and knows excellent places to stop for paid lunch. Alec, BC, Canada."

To sum it up I feel like I've been riding with a mate. Top notch, great gear (bike and equipment well looked after) fantastic roads (sandy rice fields, dirt trails, hill road and tacks, going through small villages, herds of Buffaloes an chicken...). Lot of stops to appreciate the scenery or have a grilled snake if that's your thing . I love riding but only roads, never been on a proper dirt bike, splashing in the puddles or drifting on dirt roads. Super fun. Will be back for a 2 day tour next time!"

The ride brought me through the Cambodian countryside, with amazing sceneries and experiences. Unlike commercial establishments, Lis brings you through the authentic landscapes, visiting remote areas, villages and fields.I would like to share a more personal experience too. As it was the monsoon and wet season, there were a lot of wrestle through (mud, pot-holes etc) - the rain made visibility less than ideal as well. being a novice rider, I swerved / skidded while making a sharp turn, falling and knocking off a local along the way. Thank god Lis was around to not only make sure we are ok, but to fix our bikes as well.To me, in a country less regulated than my hometown, I think the crucial factors when embarking on such tours are the expertise and experience of the guide. Lis possesses all that, and more. His sincerity in treating people and his devotion to his trade gave me a wonderful experience. I plan to brush up my riding skills and come back for a longer tour, and I will never do it with any other company.Thank you, Lis, for the amazing experience, for sharing your stories and for all the assistance rendered."

What an amazing experience - riding through the jungle, visiting remote temples, staying in remote villages - we witnessed the true Cambodia. Being the wet season we had a lot of mud to wrestle through, and some surprise river crossings that took some unique trouble shooting to figure out how to cross! This certainly added to the fun and adventure of one of the most physically demanding, yet rewarding experiences of our lives. From first contact, the communication with this company was excellent, and they tailored the trip to suit us. Lis speaks very good English and was great for a chat with a cold (or not so cold) beer at the end of a long day. He was able to create solutions when difficult situations arose - arranging families to feed us when we ran out of steam in the jungle, finding a truck driver to transport us and the bikes for a leg of the trip when we needed a break from riding in the rain, changing plans to stay at a nicer hotel on a day when we really needed a good shower! And Dolla, who was the sweep, helped pick up my bike so many times! As soon as he saw I was stuck in the mud or my bike had slid out from under me, he was straight over to help out. And he was so devoted to the maintenance of the bikes to keep them in good working order.Thank you Lis and Dolla for such an awesome experience!"

So my friend and I, both unacquainted with dirtbikes, decided a day trip up to Phnom Kulen would be a perfect way to connect with some of Cambodia's beautiful scenery and people. Our day began early with a couple of other travelers, and of course our guides Lis, his son Dolla and their friend Heang. It was quite apparent that my friend and I would need some time to practice before heading off, so we were given the opportunity to cruise around an empty lot while the guys gave us all the tips we needed to travel safely. Lis and the more experienced guys started their journey before my friend and I, while Dolla and Heang waited patiently for us to gain some confidence. Sadly, I chickened out due to feeling too small for the bike (but by the time I return there should be a smaller bike for me to use - YAY!), but Heang was kind enough to let me ride with him (what a champ!) whereas my friend bit the bullet and cruised on. Yes - beginners can do it! But I recommend you let Lis know beforehand if you are inexperienced.The trip itself was spectacular (as a passenger, at least!). Different types of terrain throughout and plenty to see. We stopped for snacks and drinks during the day, meeting locals and admiring the scenery. Waving and smiling at friendly people everywhere! Dodging cows! Dolla and Heang spoke enough English that we could chat and have a laugh along the way. My friend and I felt very safe and confident with our guides, who were an absolute pleasure to spend time with. My friend encountered a couple of issues to the mountain and back with traffic in some areas and impending darkness, but the guys let us take a break whenever we needed to chill for a bit and kept us on track.When you get to the waterfall treat yourself to some delicious food and then go for a swim! There were lots of lovely people there splashing about and including me in the fun! If you did not bring swimwear, you can hire a couple of items at the waterfall (shorts, t shirt).Water is provided, as is protective gear (but ill-fitting for a tiny person like myself). Buy yourself lunch at the waterfall and spend some time relaxing before the trip back. Buy some red bananas along the way if you get the chance! Delicious! We returned later than Lis and the others, due to our inexperience and desire to rest, but Dolla and Heang again were very patient and accommodating. Finally - the hospitality I experienced upon returning deserves its own review. My time spent with these great people left my heart full of joy. Additionally, Lis was full of so much knowledge about Khmer history and current events. Everything I came to Cambodia for I experienced with Cambodia Dirtbike Tours. I can't wait to return and ride all by myself on a longer tour! <3"

He assesses your skill with riding and either tutors you or lets you go free, depending. His son comes along too in case part of your group needs extra attention or to take an easier route.I took the 1-day trip to the mountain with the river of 1000 lingas. Water was provided, everything else (including lunch) is extra. We rode down sandy roads (difficult), hilly clay roads (awesome), and up the mountain itself. (I guess I should note that it was the dry season, which tremendously affects ground conditions (no mud).)I'd say it is really about the experience--there isn't a whole lot to discuss during the ride, even though there ARE some sights...it is really the thrill of the ride, the passing cambodian countryside, the taste of cold coconut water after being coated with dirt, the dip in the waterfall at the top of the mountain (a must after the hot ride, get over the temperature of the water! it is cold at first). I had one of the biggest treats of my trip, when at the reclining buddha statue at the top of the mountain, a baby monkey ambled over to me and began climbing all over me.You become immediate friends with whomever you're riding with, and Lis is automatically a friend as soon as you meet. I highly recommend this tour. My only hesitation is that I feel that it is a little expensive ($120) for cambodian standards. Being that a tandem (2 people, giving) 90 minute massage in downtown Siem Reap costs $12, I could see this tour being <$100.Thank you Lis for such a wonderful experience and I will definitely recommend this to fellow travelers and probably return myself, at some point!"

On our way back to Siem Reap we did a short detour to see the Banteay Srey.The tour was a perfect way to see colorful Cambodia: Red roads, green rice fields, blue sky, \u2026 We also encountered short and heavy rainfall between Phnom Kulen and Banteay Srey, but the weather cleared up very fast and we dried almost instantly.The dirt bikes were in good condition. Nothing fancy, just right.Everything else needed (helmet, gloves, boots, shirt, pants) was also provided. For one day this was fine, but for a longer tour I recommend to bring some own gear. The gear provided by Cambodia Dirt Bike had already some wear and tear. It could be worth considering investing in some new stuff ;-)Whenever I get a chance to return to Cambodia, I would definitely book a tour with Cambodia again: Not for one day, but for a longer trip to see more of the country."

Decided to go with Cambodia Dirtbike Tours because of all the great reviews, and was most definitely not disappointed. I have never ridden a dirtbike before, and had only ridden a small powered scooter a handful of times, so basically my first time on a real bike. I also didn't know how to drive a stick shift car, so manually changing gears on a motored vehicle was also new to me. I went with one other friend who also didn't know what he was doing.Lis is an amazing and super knowledgeable rider, who's english is superb (which was super convenient when he was giving us instructions and background to the places we visited). After fitted us in our rental gear and bikes, he took us out to a dirt parking lot of sorts and taught us how to ride for about 30-60 min. Once we were comfortable, we hit the road.Before we left we told Lis a couple places we had in mind, including the lost city and Phnom Kulen, and decided to go with Phnom Kulen, since we only had 7-8 hours before it got really dark (got a late start in the day - around 10-11am). It's about a 40 mile ride there and another 40 miles back. We traveled through a bunch of back dirt roads past farms, rice fields, rural towns, etc. It was amazing. Really got to see Cambodia outside of the city. Then when we arrived at Phnom Kulen, we were able to swim in the small lake that the waterfall was falling into, which was an amazing feeling to get all the dirt off our faces/bodies after a couple of hours of riding. after a casual and laid back (late) lunch, we road home through a slightly different route (mostly paved roads to make the journey back a bit faster), and safely arrived at Lis' house once again to return all the gear and bikes. We sat down with Lis for a minute after the long day, had a drink w him, some laughs and conversation, and then were on our way back.My friend and I fell twice, but only minor injuries, and only because we were slightly pushing ourselves. Lis never once made us feel uncomfortable with the terrain or pace, and was always very cognizant of where we were relative to him at all times. When we fell, we also ended up busting a tire and breaking one of Lis' clutch levers. Lis and his son were so knowledgeable that they had us back up an running in no time. Again, best day I had all throughout my 16 day trip in Southeast Asia. Highly recommend Lis and his services around Cambodia. (He also does multiday tours outside of Cambodia so look into that too if you're up for it!)"

Hands down I recommend using Cambodia Dirtbike Tours - 9/10!I travel to the developing world and do adventure tours often, it's hard to find a good balance between a high quality tour and laid back approach as well as value. I recently was riding rental dirtbikes in Moab, Utah - USA and looked into some tours - a similar tour to this one (bike, guide, gear, gas) would have easily cost 3x as much (approx. $400) and would not have been as easy going.Our guide was Lis and he nails it. We did the 1 day waterfall tour and Lis proved to make the whole day super comfortable and enjoyable. He taught my friend to ride who had never had a moto in dirt or on a trail before, customized our tour to go to a temple that was deep into the jungle and had not one sign of humans being there recently let a lone tourists. Lis had a minor mechanical issue with his chain which could have ended our tour, however he was diligent about lugging tools into the field with us so he had what he needed to fix it. Lis timed our trip to squeeze everything in and get back before dark.Lis operates this outfit out of his home and was very generous upon our return - introducing us to his family, giving us a beer and looking at where we had traveled to on google maps. He also provided tuk tuk transport to/from our hotel. He did not appear to expect a tip, but we tipped him 25% because of the great experience we had, and also to support such a well ran operation. Looking forward to next time!"

After 30 minutes of doing loops on some kind of dirt parking lot I was ready to go.Most fun I had in a long time. Fell into the mud at least a half dozen times but no bones broken. You get all the protective gear you need and more.Make sure you tell your guide what kind of experience you're expecting because there can be many customizations done to their standard tours. There are easier and more difficult roads which can be taken by novice riders. If you're okay with falling over or getting stuck sometimes, tell that to your guide and he might take you onto some of the more difficult (fun) paths with tons of mud.Super friendly and experienced staff, great fun and totally worth the money."

As we had a tight itinerary for Siem Reap and a Phnom Kulen trip takes a full day, we wanted to include Banteay Srei in this trip. Cambodia Dirtbike was right at hand with planning an itinerary for us which would include all of our wishes.A plus is that you're riding on real dirtbikes here, which cannot be compared to the smaller scooters most other local agencies offer. However, I would not recommend it for anyone without at least a bit of real motorbike experience!The trip was conducted by Lis and and his son, so we had two guides for us four participants.We were picked up in the morning at our resort and brought to our starting point, house and office of Lis in a backroad of Siem Reap. After a final check on the planned tour, we got outfitted (the gear was quite aged and also dirty, but hey, it's a dirt bike tour!) and each one got his dirt bike for the day.Off we went through some back roads in Siem Reap and into the crazy traffic of the city. Shortly after, we left the concrete and began exploring real dirt roads. The scenery was just great: the red dust road, lush green vegetation at its sides and the rice fields under the blue sky.We crossed some villages spread along the road; there were even some official buildings at these dust roads. After all, a real look into rural Cambodian life!Phnom Kulen itself is indeed close to a tourist ripoff. The reclining buddha is atop a trash-littered village. It's an interesting sight, but nothing too memorable.The Lingas in there river however were more interesting. They may seem rather unimpressive, but as we were nearly alone there, we could really appreciate the sight of a whole riverbed filled with carvings and reliefs.The waterfall area was very touristic again. Lots of stalls and shops, lots of litter and lots of people. We bathed in the basin under the great waterfall, which was quite crowded. Anyway, if you can manage to fade out all the other people, you can really indulge in the grandeur of this truly special place.After drying off and a small lunch break at a really mediocre food stall we again mounted our bikes for the trip back.On our way, we visited the marvelous Banteay Srei. Although the temple is quite small, the architecture and especially the reliefs are very impressive. In my opinion, Banteay Srei is in on par with Angkor Wat and the Bayon!Afterwards we drove through the north gate of Angkor Thom, passed the Elephant terrace and the Bayon and left the city through the west gate - a unique experience!After we returned to our starting point, our guide Lis invited us to stay for some cold drinks and have a nice chat. It was really nice to talk to a local about his life and his experiences with Cambodias recent history, the current situation of the country and the ongoing developments.I have to say that this was a truly unforgettabe experience! Maybe the tour to Phnom Kulen is not fitting for everybody; for us, it was a good way to connect the fun of the dirt bike tour with a local attraction!So it's five stars and a thumbs up for Cambodia Dirtbike!"

I partially came just to dirt bike, having read fantastic reviews on TripAdvisor, Cambodia Dirt Bike tours was always my first choice.I did a 3 day tour and ended up doing a 1 day tour a couple of days later. I had a chance to ride with both Lis (on the one day tour) and Bot (on the three day tour), both of which are extremely skilled. The 3 day tour was phenomenal! Got treated to beautiful scenery, temples and kind Cambodian people. Drove hundreds and hundreds of kilometers through dirt road, concrete, jungle, mud, water etc. Stayed at local homesteads at night. Simply cannot recommend it enough. I will be coming back to Cambodia and I will be riding with Cambodia Dirt bike tours again, that's for sure. My 1 day tour was to see the waterfall. Here I had a chance to ride with Lis, whom I've heard so much about. It was a great one day trip. The waterfall is extremely beautiful and well worth the trip. Both guides (Lis & Bot) were very good at English. Very helpful in general and knowledgeable about the locations and it's history. Dirt biking is an awesome way to see the REAL Cambodia, away from all tourism etc. Honestly, I had the time of my life! So thank you Lis & Bot! Will be seeing your again!"

If you are looking to have a fun way looking around the amazing country side of Siem Reap in a private, individual setting without the need to follow a big group or a slow ride on an ATV you are completely right here. Booking was very easy, just a call to check for availability and one day later we had our tour. Our very nice guide Lis picked us up from the hotel and helped us jump into the gear (all available from knee pads to goggles) and asked us what we want to see and if we have experience with bikes. We went for a quick test ride so he could see what we are able to do and then we were off to the offroad tracks of Siem Reap. He guided us very well through dirt roads, small jungle trails and small rivers even. He took pictures and videos of us along the way which we very much appreciated. For any issues emerging with the bikes along the way Lis would show his great mechanical skills. We were back on the bike in no time after small breakdown due to the masses of water we went through, huuuuge fun \u263a. Definitely a big recommendation!!!!"

This was such a unique and exciting experience. Being in a new country to see only the city/hotel/tourist-centric side of things is a shame. Lis will show you the authentic/interesting/natural/traditional side of Cambodia that you wouldn't normally encounter. He will cater to and match your skill level and make sure you're okay. More than this, Lis is a real person and a real Cambodian. His non-pretentious, down to Earth attitude is a refreshing escape from typical aspiring capitalists and robots. I was welcomed into his home before and after our exciting trip through mud, sand, streams, rock, and narrow jungle trails. I was grinning ear to ear telling myself, \"Am I really doing/seeing this?\" in between \"Whooo hooo'!'s.\" He knew exactly where to go and how to safely get me there. I accidentally dropped the bike and broke a small but crucial part...Liz had it fixed in a jiffy because he is prepared and has experience. Best money I've spent in years. I will be back for more.

At no point did I feel rushed or feel like I was being slowed down. I have not ridden offroad for more than 10 years so it took an hour or so to get used to again but Lis seems to have a second sense for how fast you can comfortably ride and matches it perfectly. We rode a real variety of terrain going from concrete to sand to mud to water to gravel and wooden bridges. At one stage I did manage to flood my engine but Lis is not just a good rider and guide, he's a brilliant mechanic also and had it fixed in no time atall.

Little bit of internet browsing and I knew instantly this was going to be gooood.We took the 2 day tour which will take us to 3 temples (that are secluded and practically without tourists) and a overnight stay in a homestay in a small village. I ride large motorcycles a lot (no offroad experience) but my wife can ride a bike but did not have really a lot of experience.After 15 minutes I was like a fish in the water, it is just so addictive to plough through the mud. My wife was a little bit scared first, due to her lack of experience. But after 2 hours she started to get the hang of it, after a break and a red bull she was starting to really enjoy it and loose the fear of falling. It takes a bit of time to understand and get confident that these bikes are very stable and will not easily slide / fall over in corners. After a short while you will be giving extra gas in corners to get the rear to drift :D don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything but this was no doubt the highlight of a large 1 month trip through Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.- Lis, the tour guide is a awesome dude, he really knows a lot about the country and sights and after a day riding drinking Angkor beer with him was awesome.- The landscape \u2026 seriously beautiful with the vivid green colours \u2026 farmers who ride with 2 enormous bulls- The food ! Eating at local \u201crestaurants\u201d was great, I have tasted stuff I would never ordered on my own and it was great- The homestay was basic, but just the whole experience makes you will never forget it. If you want to stay in air-con hotels and luxury stuff \u2026 you should have gone with a boring guide tour in a bus. The type of people who ride dirt bikes will not have any problems with this I am sure.- The temples are actually very nice. Some are on par with the temples in Angkor wat but minus the tourists ! - You will be very wet and dirty, I have learned that the Cambodia soil leaves red stains that will not wash out of your clothes. Put on some old cloths and take some spare cloths with you so you can \u201cshower\u201d (if you take a multi-day tour) !"

The scenery is breathtaking throughout the whole tour, as you ride through thick jungle, rice fields, dirt tracks and small villages.The guides also know a number of different routes to take you through to cater for first time riders all the way up to advanced.After the tour, Mr Lis also invited us to a New Years Celebration at his house with his family and some people that had done the tour earlier that week.

We did a one day tour to a remote temple which was great because there were very few people at this temple and no restrictions on where you could explore.The level of difficulty was perfect, some of the hardest riding I have done but i felt comfortable the entire time. As we were told before, Lis adjusts the route to the level of the riders and does a good job. The bikes are in good shape and he has all the safety gear. (also in good condition) Unfortunately we missed our beers at the end of the day. I guess we will have to come back and do it again! Thanks Lis!"

            "review": "7 days of amazing and exhausting fun. I booked a 7 day tour in the north. Mr. Lis provided me with his colleague Aki as a guide. He is probably a little sportier than Mr. Lis. So as a relatively inexperienced rider i spent 7 days of hard work in the jungle, deep sand, ruts, rice fields. I was bruised, sore and exhausted, but i loved every minute of it. One cannot describe this. It is one big rush. The guide could be a sports coach: he puts a challenge right in front of you and he makes you do it, without having to push. Less stick, more carrot to make the donkey move so to speak. I'll be back. That's for sure."

I booked the two day tour, which proved to be a fantastic way to discover a less touristy side of Cambodia combined with the thrills of dirtbiking in the jungle, across sandy roads, mud and pools of water. Although I had no experience on a dirt bike before, Mr. Lis and Sam patiently explained how to handle the bike and get better. Both of them are outstanding guys, which makes the tour even more fun. Thanks to them, it was a truly fantastic experience filled with beautiful sights of the country, some technical parts to test my motorcycling skills and some parts with more speed. Great two days, would recommend it to anybody who likes driving motorcycles!"

At arrival in Siem Reap the tourguide came and picked us up from the busstop. We didn't have hotel bookings at arrival, but the tourguide helped us out with this and found us a really nice hotel. The same evening we went together and had a traditional cambodian dinner at place tourist would never go to..it was amazing food and probably 10x better than the food at touristic places! Our stay turned out to be at the time there was cambodian New Year. Lis (our tourguide) was so nice that he invited us to his own house to celebrate new year at his place, while having beers around a campfire. Above described is just how friendly and open the tourguide was to us to make us feel at home. To top all this up...the tour itself was amazing and a journey never to forget.If you are looking for something different and have a true experience of Cambodia I just recommend to do this!!best regards,Leo"

            "review": "Tough and fun 3day offroad tour!. Hi my name is Richard and i went on a 3day tour with Lis in january (dry season). Weather were great so i recomend this time of year if you dont want to spend entire days in the mud (rainy season). CDT has alot of bikes and gears and i got a Honda XR Baja and were suited up with dirtbike clothes and saftey gear. It was perfect for tough terrain. And terrain was tough enough for me with little experience on a offroad bike. The best thing i must say is that Lis has so much experience that he can adjust to your level. Just by being around a experienced guy like Lis is always fun cos you know he's gonna take you to a new level, and he did!I had alot of fun going through jungle tracks, sand trails, single tracks, rocks,roots and whatnot, but trust me it was alot of hard work. And more than that, i learned new things about riding and myself. I now consider myself a better rider and tougher than i were before i came here. We almost went 500km on this tour which were kinda hard on my body but you just need to stick trough and reward will come. Going trough small villages we sometimes stop for a coke or some food. Kids used to run up to the bikes. I just love Cambodia. People are so friendly and smiley just about everywere. I suggest you take some candy with you so you can pass it out as you will meet alot of kids along the way. We slept in guest houses/hotels so you get a good night sleep after a hard day on the bikes. Mosquito reppelant comes in handy here. Cambodian food isnt always what you expect, but if your lucky you get to eat some of the \"specialties\", i say no more :)To sum this up:Location is fantastic; Alot of different tracks, and you get to see some of the best temples in the world. Guide; Lis is amazing so experienced and helpful and speaks very good english. He used to work as a guide so he knows alot about history and culture.Gear; Honda XR 250cc made to endure everything, and you get to pick clothes in your own size ;)What more do you need? You'll have a great time! Cheers"

Lis was my guide and it was absolutely awesome. I told him I wanted to ride a lot of single track so he took some special routes to bring me to some really cool places. We did just about everything: Jungle Riding, River Crossings, Marsh Crossings, Village Routes, Temple Visits and more! I can't wait to review my go pro video of some of the Marsh Crossings, those were really fun to go through.I can't express how much fun it was and Lis was also there to take pictures and video during the ride. He got some really great video of a river crossing in the middle of the Cambodian jungle. Now that's just awesome.He also set up everything so all you have to do is enjoy your time riding. He helped translate at the local villages, helped me order from the local menus, took videos and pictures, and did full dirt bike checks at the end of the rides. He also has a lot of knowledge of Cambodian and the surrounding area's history, so when you take a break at the end of the day you can learn a lot by being around him.Lis is a rockstar and gives the best dirt bike experience in Cambodia! I highly recommend him on your next tour!"

One of the many highlights was the trip to a hidden temple that is only accessible via bike. One thing that set him apart is that he's here to make a friend. At the end of the ride, he bought beers and we seat around his house talking about the day's trip. This is definitely one of the best way to get to know Siem Reap and it's people."

We really needed a break from the tourists, so.we booked a dirt bike tour around the country side. My girlfriend had no real dirt bike experience and I had not rode a dirt bike for over ten years... Mr. Liz took us to get all sized up with real dirt biking equipment for safety and style and then we went to an open field to learn the basics, after a little while we were ready for the fun to start. We started out down the dirt, sand and barely paved roads away from the city, within minutes you are literally in the middle of rice paddies and palm trees. We drove past water buffaloes, countless bird species, typical villages and into some other ruin sites ( we were only people there) The villages were incredible... They were preparing palm sugar in a vat over a fire and also distilling rice wine. Most villagers greeted us with smiles and waving children. We didn't see one tourist for six hours. Mr. Liz speaks fluent English and was very safety oriented, punctual and full of amazing stories. The only thing we would change about the half day tour, would be to go for a longer tour. Mr Liz offers multiple day trips as well as half or full days. We want to do the ride from Vietnam to Siam ReAp next time. Thanks again Mr.Liz"

I did the two day tour which was great fun, however I must warn complete beginners that you are best not to do this in the rainy season. The tracks were only a little wet but the mud was horrific and made it very difficult for me as a novice and thus the jungle part was not enjoyable. The session at the start designed to familiarise you with the bike is not sufficient for a novice to navigate the narrow trails in the sticky mud. The homestay was enjoyable and seeing the deserted temples was a nice change from the crowded ones at Angkor. Ensure that you take plenty of water and a suitably sized rucksack to carry any food and water - there are no shops in the jungle!!A fantastic experience but very tough for complete beginners for the jungle part. Driving on the roads through rubber plantations and villages was beautiful and easy."

            "review": "What an experience!. Just returned from a great week and half visit of Cambodia, and by far the highlight of the trip was the 3 day tour I did with Cambodia Dirtbike Tours. Prior to my trip, I did extensive reading of reviews of different companies to figure out which one to choose, as there are quite a few. One name really stood out in reviews I read, Mr. Seng Lis. The reviews really made Mr. Lis seem like an outstanding guide who made sure his clients had access to safe food (a major concern of mine), so I figured that was my guy. Also, Cambodia Dirtbike Tours had multiple positive reviews from people who were complete beginners prior to taking the tour. This was the deciding factor for me, as I was for the most part a total beginner. Additionally, the fact that they provide all riding and protective gear (knee, elbows, chest wall, shoulders, boots, goggles) was a big factor.Met Mr. Lis and found him to be a very nice person. He spoke English very well, not commonplace in Cambodia. We went to the training area, and it took me awhile before I finally was ready to take the bike on the open road. Mr. Lis was a great instructor and extremely patient with me. Once we got out on the open road, the natural beauty of the countryside was breathtaking. And I truly enjoyed passing through the small rural villages, riding on red brick clay dirt roads, riding around cattle and locals on bicycles, children waving at us, looking over and seeing water buffaloes basking in bright green rice patties. Just amazing!The place we stayed the first night was in a rural area and had mosquito netting. The next night, the hotel did have air conditioning. The remote temples we visited were simply phenomenal. Mr. Lis had a tremendous knowledge of Cambodian history, which added to the experience. The food was always safe, and always with plentiful bottled water.Mr. Lis always gave as much time as needed to stop anyplace I wanted to take photos of the beautiful scenery or to rest. Also, he displayed his considerable mechanic skills one day when I accidentally dropped the bike in knee deep water, completely submerging it (apparently very bad for the bike). It was the rainy season, and out in a very remote area.... He always remained nice, and really patient with a beginner like me. By the end of the third day of riding, I was almost a pro. Can't emphasize enough what a truly wonderful experience it was. Thank you so much Mr. Lis!"

Seng took us through the countryside for a super rid with lots of rugged terrain and a long stretch of challenging trail covered by soupy mud and water holes with the consistentcy of a mango shake. Super ride the whole way with amazing temples. The gear worked out great and we even had water above the exhaust so the bikes had to be dried out on a few occasions. Came back in the dark and finished the day at his wife's store over a few beers and a review of photos and some super viedos taken by Seng.

Each day had adrenaline filled dirt bike riding, broken up with stops at surreal ancient temples. The temples were pretty remote, and we were typically free to climb around on the ruins. The riding was a good balance between challenging trails mixed with dirt roads - and highways when necessary. We went in the beginning of June, the start of the rainy season, so some trails were very muddy and had us crossing through thigh-deep puddles! We spent the first night in a random village along the way, and stayed at a community lodge. We were the only foreigners in town, and it was a great way to get a feel for local life as we walked around in the late evening. The locals were friendly and even sat us down at fed us fried grasshoppers\u2026 which were surprisingly delicious! The next night was spent at a hotel in a bigger town, but we enjoyed the evening by eating some local foods and drinking beers with our guide, Lis.The company website and emails are managed by Chris, a responsive and considerate German ex-pat living in Siem Raep. We met him at the Golden Orange Hotel upon arrival in Siem Riep, and he later had us meet with the guide and business-owner Lis (a local Cambodian) to plan the specifics of our three day trip. Once Lis got a feel for what my friend and I were interested in, he modified our trip to also include interesting stops like Pol Pot\u2019s mountain bunker hideout.Lis was a great guide. He spoke perfect English and was having just as much fun as us on the trail. We all rode hard and beat the heck out of the bikes along the way (Honda XR250\u2019s). Inevitably, we had a few mechanical issues, but nothing that Lis couldn\u2019t fix within short time. Also, he didn\u2019t try to charge us for any minor damages incurred along the way \u2013 it was all about having fun! Lis owns the bikes and woke up early to make sure our bikes were in proper order each morning. Lis was also very knowledgeable, and took the time to explain history, culture, and food as we inquired. There were a lot of different dirt bike companies to choose from when I looked into planning this trip \u2013 but I feel very lucky to have chosen the trip with Lis and his bikes. Lis has a fun, yet responsible, character that really made our trip special."

( only a three wheeler when I was 12 years old..over 30 years ago). We both never been on a dirtbike before. Lis Seng ( owner of Cambodia dirt bike tours) and friends ( sorry I forgot the other owner name) taught us on a empty dirt road. Lis Seng and friends were great! They showed us how to start, shift & brake the bike. They had all the gear to rent. Helmet, boots, gloves, protective Google's and protective gear . I was very nervous not being on dirt bike before and the bike looked intimating. I'm a 5'5\" heavyset female. & 235lbs. They put me on a 250cc dirtbike. They lowered the fork so my feet can touch the ground. I was comfortable. They all were patient. They told me and my friend we could ride up and down the dirt road as long as we wanted; until we felt comfortable. No pressure at all.  Once we felt comfortable our adventure began! What an amazing 4 days! Gosh! There was so much to see! Temples, farmland, Villages, towns, rice patties and the PEOPLE! The people of Cambodia are the most friendliest and kind people around! One of the highlights of our tour was seeing children come out to the road smiling, and waving to us as we went by.... Other highlights was seeing the small villages with grass huts and palm trees everywhere! Incredible to see..and of course meeting so many people! We visited so many Temples! One was in the mountains with great views...And some of the Temples only could be seen by dirtbike. No roads! Just trails! Lis Seng was a fantastic guide and host. My friend and I live in the U. S. and spoke english. Lis Seng is fluent in English and was very helpful and interpreted for us. It was a life experience! A trip a definitely want to go back and do again.

Pricewise these guys give you the best on offer compared the other competitors out there(and there are a couple trust me!).

For a special experience in Cambodia, beside all the touristy temple-hopping and Tuk-Tuk stop and go Cambodia Dirtbike Tour is a very good choise! If you like a real adventure beside the track, Cambodia dirtbike is one of the best option what you can do (if you prefer riding bikes ;-)What can you expect?Fun Fun Fun. Start is in Siem Reap, and after a 5 ride minutes out of town you are really out of town and are in the middle of the real Cambodia life. Hidden tracks will be discovered, some more challenging and depending on season (muddy, sandy or gravel road). Lis our guide always found interesting stops, either for having some food / drinks, or \u2013 the most interesting \u2013 hidden temples. Temples where you are nearly alone and you can explore the inside of the temple by your own! Otherwise just drive and relax by the sound of your bike and the surroundings. During your ride you get full equipment (helmet, protection gear, trouser, shirt and gloves), so in case of something you are fully protected.Overnight you are at homestay. Drink and eat with locals and chat about everything.If you have questions about the country, people, villages, Lis can explain you everything. And he knows nearly everyone, so that you cannot go lost in the jungle ;-)Normally you can go on Honda XR 250. Very reliable bikes. But Lis can organize higher and lower rated bikes if you want \u2013 just ask in advance.Back to town after the ride, we were invited for dinner by Lis and Chris (his partner from Germany), and had a nice evening with some beer and nice Cambodian dishes.Thanks Lis and Chris for having that great tour with you."

The local food was great and no doubt the weather was hot but that's a small price to pay for riding in dry season. Lis Seng is the man to look for if you need to hire someone to bring you offroad in Cambodia! I will be coming back during winter when the weather is cooler! Meanwhile keep up the good work!"

            "review": "The only way to see the real Cambodia - on a dirtbike and with Lis.. Without a doubt, Lis is an exceptionally experienced and knowledgable guide. His riding and mechanical skills and it goes without saying, are outstanding. My first day of riding was a real challenge because all the elements (sun, sand, terrain) together pushed me to my limits on my virgin ride on a 250cc. A few points that I had to list to highlight why Lis is the one to go see Cambodia on a dirtbike with :1. A. Dedicated, full customer service : I'm a very petite girl (at 150-153 cm) who loves to dirtbike. My riding partner, Sean , had scoured the entire Internet to find a suitable agency to go dirtbiking in Cambodia with. Lis' Cambodian Dirtbike Tours is the ONLY one who suited- Lis went out of his way to find me a suitable bike and made sure that I was comfortable with the settings before I rode.  B. My riding boots sole was falling off after my trying first day. Upon arriving at the homestay at the end of the ride, Lis set off immediately to find screws to repair my boots with and fixed my boots on the spot. C. I was too knackered to continue on the challenging trail the next day and Lis immediately came up with another route for us to take so that I could deal with an easier trail. He is very open and communicative so it makes planning for the trip very easy and enjoyable. He even had a sweeper come along so that my riding buddy could enjoy a faster pace while the sweeper accompanied me so I could ride at my own pace. Trail wise, we split a little so we each could have what we wanted (my riding buddy and I). Totally customizable and that was awesome!!!2. Lis is a walking GPS and Wikipedia, he knows all flora and fauna , every nook and cranny, every story and facts. We were all transfixed whenever we listen to his stories. Most importantly, we had utmost trust in his skills and were able to leave everything in his hands to have a good time. 3. Lis is RELIABLE - he can fix anything !! From my boots to the bikes. He gets up every morning early to make sure everything is top and running with the bikes. Overall, it was all fun under the Cambodian sun because of the people I rode with and Lis made it all possible for me so A BIG THANK YOU TO Lis Seng and Cambodian Dirtbike Tours. And you made this little girl on a dirtbike very happy. It was for lack of a better word, AMAZING.Go with Lis, he's a top bloke and you'll end up like me, a little awe struck that I had just ridden offroad in Cambodia."

I read all of the other reviews for Lis and they are all accurate. Every morning when I would walk outside Lis would have already been up for at least an hour. The bikes were serviced and ready to go. This guy rides all day with at least 35 lbs. of tools in a bag on his waiste and another 40 on his back. And you could never pull ahead if he didn't let you. I have met hard workers in my life but nothing like Lis. To have put together a business as successful as his after all of the hardships speaks to the man's character. Like a lot of Cambodians his family lost members to the psychotic Pol Pot. He has a degree in hotel management, tourism and four years of college level english. If Lis had been born in New York he would be the CEO of a fortune 500 company right now. Traveling with him is like visiting with a family member who has a doctorate in history. The country is beautiful the people extremely friendly and always smiling. The food offerings everywhere we stopped incuded chicken, beef, pork, fish and the most colorful vegtables on earth. All cooked simply in fun, generally great \"people watching\" settings. Simply tell Lis how hard you want to ride and the rest will just happen. I was going to post my personal telephone number here but it is not allowed on this site. If you are unsure about going or have concerns contact Lis and I will tell him to share my number. I will be going back for ten days in December 2013 for another adventure and will write again."

We have traveled from the northern frontier near Prasat Neak Buos to the inner burbs of Phnom Penh. Lis has a good command of English and is easy to contact via email or text. As a guide he tells you frankly about the pros and cons of cross-country routes, but is willing to take up the challenge if you desire an extreme taste of rural Cambodia. More importantly he knows motorbikes inside out and can do an excellent repair job out in the boonies where trouble normally strikes. As a researcher of the Khmer Rouge period I have required the services of a tactful and informed guide. Mr. Lis is able to create a good rapport with rightly suspicious KR veterans as well as local food vendors and government staff. His experience as a soldier means that he can explain the various shifts that occurred during the Cambodian civil war(s). As a native of Siem Reap, Lis can show you the best bits without being ripped off. He understands the importance of a good bathroom and comfortable as well as safe tasty food. With a little warning Lis can meet you in any corner of Cambodia and guide you to the places you need to see. His has many fascinating anecdotes and knows heaps of people throughout northern and western Cambodia. Please consider him if you want a custom tour guide with real knowledge and practical ability."

Lis is a great guide and a good rider. Left at 8:30am, got back at around 5pm after lots of mucking about on backroads, small trails, and footpaths. Besides Beng Melea we also went to some \"hidden\" carvings, and a small 9th C temple beside a wat - it was festival time so lots of kids climbing over everything. Lis is knowledgable about most of what happens around Siem Riep. He also has a great way of interacting with the local people we came across to buy food and drinks, or those lounging at the \"hidden\" carvings. Lis speaks good English. Each season has its pros and cons - I went on 15 Ocober 2012 - it is the end of the wet season so lots odf tracks through rice fields are submerged. The general state of disrepair of all the roads means that even the larger dirt roards are seriously potholed. Honda XR 250 was perfect - I am 90kg and 6'2\"."

            "review": "The adventure of a lifetime!. When I began my research, I came across countless websites of tour companies based in Siem Reap offering very similar bike tour packages. So before jumping on the first choice available, I wanted to make sure I was in good hands and with an experienced guide who knew his way around properly. I came across one company (whose name I shall not mention out of fairness) that had great reviews, most of which were about a certain guide by the name of Lis Seng. Lis, who now runs his own company called Cambodia Dirtbike Tours, is probably one of the most experienced guys out there. He is a very knowledgeable tour guide who knows everything about Khmer culture, history and the various heritage sites; he is also a great rider and an expert mechanic! We did a four day ride from Siem Reap to Preah Khan temple, then headed north to the Thai border to visit Preah Vihear, a old and very sacred temple which is built on the edge of a high cliff. The riding was fantastic, with a great combination of technical sections through the jungle, crossing rivers and marshes, as well some more open flat roads where we could hit some good speed. Lis can adapt the choice of routes depending on the level of the rider of course. The XR 250s were in great condition and we didn't have a single problem despite the rough terrain we were crossing.The evenings were spent in small hotels and home stays to get a real feel of Cambodian culture. What I enjoyed as much as the ridding were the interesting discussions I had with Lis where he shared his experiences of growing up and living in Cambodia.I would most definitely recommend Cambodia Dirt Bike Tours if you are looking for a full experience where the ridding is just one part of the great trip you will have!."

If you want to feel like you are riding through Cambodia with a few mates, stopping for lunch in the interesting places and having a few beers at night then Lis is the perfect choice as your guide.I rode for 4 days with Lis in 2011 and it was truly an unforgettable experience. I am an experienced road rider but had never rode a dirt bike before. Lis showed me a few tips and tricks and was patient but left me to my own devices. There was times he was riding beside me, times when he rode behind me and took photographs and video and others when he rode up ahead and let me enjoy the solitude of the Cambodian countryside myself. Riding off the usual tourist trails and into the jungles, villages and ruins, we visited Beng Malea, Srey Yong, Prasat Pram, Prasat Tamoan and the unforgettable Kulen Mountain.We finished up each night with a few beers and chatted with the locals, Lis as interpreter. He has an amazing knowledge of his country's history and culture and can show you exactly what you want to see, how you want to see it. If you want to see a side of Cambodia that only a true local can show you, stop comparing companies and choose Lis. I promise you won't be disappointed."

The trip was just epic from the start we woke up quite hungover and headed to the Bikeplace, We got on our bike put some petrol in and we were off ( having done already 1000 km on dirtbikes in Cambodia we didn't need any advice ) We told the guy to go and not be scared to go too hard !! It was really good because normally the guides always are a bit scared to go too hard, It was not the case ! Although you can also ask him to slow down whenever you want for a picture ! In a couple of words : If you are experienced, like the adventure and want to see some far gone temples that litle people get to visit take this TOUR !!!!"

You cannot get a sense of Cambodia any better way than on a dirt bike, and the ruins we saw are world class -- without the understandable crowds of the Siem Reap sites. Regardless of how spectacular the territory and the ruins are, you must have a terrific guide to get the most out of the experience, and Lis Seng is all of that and more. His personal knowledge of the area, of the sites, of Cambodia's history and of linking them all together is profound. If you want an adventure that will keep your adrenaline pumping for days and keep you thinking of Cambodia for years, set one up with Lis. You will be thrilled that you did."

All needs were catered for; bikes (Honda 250's I think - hard as nails warhorses, took everything we threw at them and more) equipment etc..some of us were beginners but not a problem - a thorough 101 lesson on an open patch of ground near the start of the trails and we were on our way. Chris and Lis are fantastic riders and they mentored us gradually and safely through the first few hours till we got comfortable then upped the stakes as the days progressed so we always had something to sink our teeth into. As for the trip? Temples, waterfalls, lost carvings deep in the jungles, dirt roads, sand, mud, stones, tarmac, paddy fields, water buffaloes?, cows, dogs, chickens, snakes - welcoming locals and hilarious wide-eyed and cheeky inquisitive children at every village ready to take you on at hackey-sack or William Tell style beer can bowling (all rights reserved). No GPS for Lis by the way, he sights his 'special' trails from trees and landmarks and is always checking with the locals for places of interest for the riders as they pass through. Do yourself a favour and make sure you ask them about staying at the hotel where they operate out of too- comfortable rooms and an alfresco bar and free pool table too in the heart of Siem Reap.Amazing time and we will be back again, thank you Lis, Chris (& Jenny) for your fantastic hospitality.

After this trip organized by Cambodia Dirtbike, we were not disappointed. Starting off as absolute beginners we were well trained by our guide Lis Seng and having well maintained bikes and equipment really helped. Originally we had planned 3 days of dirtbiking leaving the final day to see Angkor Wat, but we enjoyed the 3 days so much we came back on the fourth day for more. What a good choice that was too.. Each day the terrain was different and got better and better. We enjoyed every minute of it. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to see the real Cambodia and looking for a bit of adventure. We were looked after very well by our guide who even helped to arrange our transportation back to Phnom Penh. Thanks Chris and Lis Seng for an unforgettable holiday."

            "review": "Northern Cambodia by Trail Bike. After a couple of weeks kitesurfing in Bali I headed to Phnom Penh,Cambodia and then 6 hours bus ride further north to Siem Reap, the starting point for trips around the Angkor Wat area. The temples are certainly spectacular and the location is incredibly hot. In fact, I\u2019ve never been hotter in my life! After getting a bit \u201ctempled-out\u201d I followed up my earlier plan to do a trail bike tour withhttp://www.cambodiadirtbike.com/There are several other local companies that do the same sort of thing but some charge extra for riding gear and this company was recommended by a friend. The company has several different tours including a 3 day tour for $400 including all expenses except food and drink. The boss, Seng Lis, was already booked on another tour but said he was happy for me to do the tour-for-1 with his mechanic as the guide. He offered me $100 off the $400 fee if I could find another rider. I had met a young bloke in my Phnom Penh hotel who was on the same flight as me from Bangkok. We caught up again in Siem Reap and I asked him if he rode a bike at home. He does and yes, he would be interested in a 3 day tour. So, I got a $100 discount and Derek from Melbourne paid $300 too. We started at the bike shop the next morning at 8. I squeezed on a stack of protective gear that made me look like and feel like a Ninja Turtle. I could barely walk and the left boot was just about breaking my ankle. Within 10 minutes we were out of Siem Reap on a dirt road and FLYING!!! I\u2019m not a very experienced dirt biker and was planning on a leisurely cruise along some scenic jungle tracks but, to be honest, I didn\u2019t see much except the dust cloud in front of me for a while! I soon learnt that standing up on the footpegs was most comfortable on the rougher tracks. This also rested the slightly sore rear end which resulted from sitting down on a nice hot plastic seat. This is a VERY hot country with high humidity. Luckily, after around 10 km of very slippery deep sand we hit the black stuff and headed north. There was virtually nobody on the road. No cars, no bikes, no people, no farmland even. It was quite unexpected. The country is over 90% dead flat, very green but with little agriculture except in the south and nearer to regional centres. There were no side roads or tracks, few rice fields and no actual \u201cjungle\u201d. The only regular obstacle was stray cattle in the middle of the road. I haven\u2019t seen as many strays since I was in India years ago. The riding was fun, VERY hot when we stopped, but a pleasant temperature when moving. It was certainly harder going on an older Honda 250 trail bike than a road bike. Our top speed was about 85 km/hr although locals rarely ride faster than 30.The roads were very good and we eventually reached the Thai border at a small village where Pol Pot was cremated. We covered about 240 km on the first day and were hanging out for beer by 4pm. Not sure where we stayed the first night but the AC didn\u2019t come on until 7pm and was very welcome. It was extremely hot and like everywhere in Cambodia there is rarely a breath of wind away from the coast. The AC went off again at some stage but we managed to get some sleep. The second day we headed up to Preah Vihear. It\u2019s at the top of a small mountain accessible only by 4WD very slowly, or trail bike. It was an exciting ride up, VERY steep in parts, maybe 1 in 4. There were no foreigners there. In fact, we didn\u2019t see any foreigners for over 2 days as we were so far north. We were right on the Thai border at the EXACT place where they have been shooting each other recently. It was on our tour so we went there! There were soldiers everywhere and we were stopped for passport checks at 2 checkpoints. We went into Army bunkers and looked through their tripod mounted binoculars trained on the Thai position. They showed us where the last missile hit the temple about a month ago. The temple is quite impressive, around 1,000 years old and needs a fair bit of restoration. Not a lot of point in that though as the Thais may well knock it down again! It seems that both sides claim ownership of the temple and this has been going on for around 3 years this time around. Some claim it\u2019s a political diversion in Thailand to get the emphasis away from the red-shirt protests.Our second night was in a tiny village called Samyorng Ko Keh. No AC in this wooden building which only had very basic grotty \u201ctoilets\u201d. The beds were quite big with a mozzy net but even with the fan on full speed it was stinking hot! Nothing much to do here. As darkness came the locals set fire to piles of rubbish and smoke inundated the whole village. Luckily we don\u2019t suffer from asthma! Everybody goes to bed about 8pm! It took hours to get to sleep but I finally managed a few hours and awoke at 5am to the racket of the locals preparing for market etc. Lots of little tractors and motorbikes loaded down with food etc. We headed out on dirt to another remote temple called Koh Keh. It was pretty amazing walking around this place being basically the only people there. So peaceful and so different from the much more touristy places at and near Angkor Wat! Lots of tree roots winding around ancient temple walls.After another few hours and a fair bit of dirt we reached Beng Melea which is reputed to be one of the best temples in the country and mostly torn apart by the surrounding \u201cjungle\u201d. It\u2019s about 60km from Siem Reap so a few tourists do make it here by taxi or tuk-tuk but it was still very quiet. It was the first place we had visited where they were trying to sell us food and drinks!It\u2019s a fantastic location and a local \u201cguide\u201d showed us the mountaineer\u2019s version of a temple tour where we literally clambered over fallen stones to get to much better pictures than the other tourists. We happily donated a few bucks for the privilege as they are usually quite fussy where you can walk.After lunch we hit the dirt again. Our guide, Tin, managed to get completely lost whilst assuring us he knew exactly where we were going! At one point we were actually creating a brand new track through the middle of a freshly ploughed field! This happened on several occasions but we were having so much fun we weren\u2019t going to complain! We rode through endless \u201cwater jumps\u201d and a few rivers. There was one incredibly rickety bridge about 4 feet wide that we crossed twice. First time on Day One when Derek\u2019s bike got to the end of the bridge the last timber shot up into the air and dropped into the river. I was about 5m behind him at the time. The second time, all the kids and locals came out after Tin and Derek crossed to see if I managed to make it over. I dropped into first gear and floored it. No worries! Tin just LOVES to ride dirt. It was impossible to hold him back. Our Honda 250\u2019s, although quite old, had heaps of grunt although none of the mod-cons like\u2026\u2026.speedo, mirrors, brakes. The Ninja Turtle gear nearly came in quite handy when I finally dropped my bike in a muddy bog that was deeper than the height of the axles. It would be more accurate to say that I simply stepped off it when it stopped dead. No harm done and back on board in about 5 seconds. I think the distance of 60km from the last temple back to Siem Reap was increased considerably by Tin taking all the dirt tracks he knows. He even turned OFF the dirt tracks so he could create some new ones! We had our share of close shaves though. On day 1 I missed a calf by only inches after it shot out from behind a bush in the right hand ditch to find it\u2019s mother who was already on the left hand side of the road trailing a 20ft rope. On day 2 Derek narrowly missed an erratic dog that couldn\u2019t decide which way to run. On day 3, on a 4 foot wide dirt track I narrowly missed a young water buffalo that ran across right in front of me. It was the first time I have ridden in a country with right hand drive. Didn\u2019t have a problem but then I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in the towns where many Cambodians are very unpredictable drivers.I have never been so hot in my life or so dirty in my life or had so much fun in my life!"

I remembered emailing Ravuth to ask about the 4-days tour at Angkor after seeing those positive reviews at Tripadvisor, and he replied instantly every time I sent him queries about the tour. I would say booking this tour is one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life, Ravuth is an easy-going, honest, kind driver who would wave at us with a big and heartwarming smile every time we finished visiting the temples, He would offer us bottled water frequently to keep us refreshed under the sweltering heat. Despite being late in the morning(we always negotiated to meet at 9:00am but were never punctual), he was always polite and provided his best service without pouting. If you ever need a tour at Angkor, don't bother to google anything, just choose Ravuth. You won't regret on your smart decision."

I told him the temples I want to see and he gives the price. He is very quick in replying our inquiries. At first, I think the price is a bit high to me as I was travelling on a tight budget. But after checking with quite a few other tuk tuk drivers recommended on TA, I found out that he is providing the best price which includes free pick-up from airport/ bus station, the far-away Banteay Srei temple and Sunrise at Angkor Wat. For 2 days, I went with 2 different tuk tuk drivers as Ravuth (driver for the 1st day) is not available for the 2nd day. Both of them are friendly, helpful and drove with care. I would recommend them to you and it's good to plan ahead a tuk tuk before your adventure in the Angkor Park. However, I think they should try to find more good and cheap places for guests to eat during the tour as the restaurant we were brought in the first day was too pricey. Over all, I'm satisfied with their services and they are a good choice for you during your time in Siem Reap."

In terms of Cambodia that is a lot of money, but he drove us a long way and he was very knowledgeable and knew more than most of the tour guides. He was excellent in every regard. Very informative and a good driver that I felt safe to be in the car with.Our son got in the front and asked all the right questions for us to get the political and history information about the area we were going to. Kim had brought cold water, and towelettes for us which was nice and he gave them out each time we stopped. Koh Ker was definitely worth the trip. Kim knew all the side temples in the area and recommended that we stop at a couple, but generally let us choose between a drive by or a stopover for photos. On the way back we also went to Beng Melea as our son had not been there and we quite liked it (see strong man on pedestal pose). This time it was even better as we got to see parts we had not seen before as one of the parks officers beckoned us to follow him and we clambered over huge cut and fallen bluestone blocks to see parts you don\u2019t normally see from the recently installed walkways. At the end of course there was request for a tip which we acquiesced to despite knowing guards are not supposed to show you around.Kim decided to take a different road back so we would see different countryside and got us back a little after we had paid him to."

Like what most other reviewers say, he is ALWAYS on a look out for us, even when the meeting time is within a range of an hour. For the first two days, we visited the small and big circuit respectively. We only hired a guide for Ang Kor Wat, which in our opinion was sufficient. This is because the stories mostly revolves around the same few things. For the other bigger temples, you can just secretly follow some other tour to get some insights. Else, Soda does have a guide book that provide you with a simple summary. For the smaller temples, we did not spend much time. On the first two days, we were also brought to do pottery (FUN!) and a more local night market where Soda accompanied us around. The last day, we went further to kbal spean, acca (very nice!) and banteay srey, land mine museum and had our final sunset at angkor wat. Highly recommend this despite the long journey. Kbal spean is rather boring since its dry season (Soda did mention that to us but we chose to go for it still).Will definitely recommend having him simply because he makes everything convenient and more importantly, his price is very reasonable!"

For standard tours (like the big and small circle in Angkor Wat or the Bantheay Srei temple) he turned out to be a good and child-friendly choice. Given the size of parking lots, we very much appreciated that he actively looked out for us after our temple visits. He also had suggestions for restaurants and evening excursions. The only thing that did not work well was that his company (Angkor Tuk Tuk Travel) tried to re-negotiate the price we had agreed upon some months before."

Tuk tuk is a good choice, because it's comfortable and authentic. Our driver PinTon was very kind, helpful and flexible. We took many photos, and we stopped everywhere. He was waiting for us while we visted the temples. We always got ice cold towels and drinking water. We also had an hour brake for lunch.We had a great day, thank you Angkor tuk tuk travel!

If I have the chance to go back to Siem Reap I will absolutely contact him again for his service.

At only $20, it is an awesome way to see the temples at your own pace, and the friendly and helpful tuk-tuk driver Ravuth had free chilled mineral water and towels on hand for us to beat the heat (not too hot and rather breezy when we went in late June!). Even though we spent a lot of time slowly exploring the temples and taking photos, Ravuth is always waiting for us patiently at each stop, even taking the trouble to fetch us back to the hotel to have buffet breakfast after catching the sunrise, and back to the temples. He also pointed many interesting sculptures and sites along the way, and offered to take photos for us. The temples were amazing- you could even take an elephant ride up to the most famous one to catch the sunset. Everything was well taken care of- he's flexible with requests (will take you to the night market when the tour ends if you wish! Remember to check out the iconic Angkor What bar at Pub Street near the night market, with edgy graffiti walls) and even offered to drive us to washrooms even when they are walking distances away. Great if you want to minimise all the travelling hassle and fully enjoy the beauty of the temples. I called them last minute at 10.30pm the day before my tour to book for the day after after seeing all the good reviews and they were at my hotel lobby right on time. They offer longer trips and other customised requests too."

Right out of the airport, we were greeted by the tuk tuk drivers led by Pipi and Dong, who came half an hour early to pick us up for the Golden Mango Hotel (It is also highly recommended by our group, after staying in 3 different 2-4 star hotels). In the following 3 days, we had used their 4 tuk tuks for the small circle and big circle to see many temples, including one day leaving at 5am to see the sunrise at Angor Wat. Pipi and his team really took care of us. He changed plans and routes to accommodate our changing needs, always picked the best locations for us to get on and off(for example, dropping off at the east gate and picking up from the opposite west gate, so we didn't have to walk a long way back), recommended good spots for us to take photos (Pipi has good eyes for photos ;-), and worked out the schedule perfectly under our tight schedule (we wanted to see as much as possible while we were there). The team spoke English pretty well, understood our needs and thought for us. They have a good sense of humor and had kept our group in a good mood (we got tired after long walks in temples in high temperature under strong sun for the whole day). Luckily, Pipi brought lots of bottle water and kept them in coolers for us ;-)We would like to thank Pipi and the team for their help during our stay, and highly recommend them to anyone visiting Angkor wat."

For the first 2 days, we had booked drivers with our hotel but on the final day we decided to go with this company as we felt they offered more value.Our booking was done via email with Mr. Soda and we decided to go with sunrise at Angkor Wat plus the tour of Banteay Srei and it's surrounding temples. The arrangement was easy, price was a lot cheaper than what the hotel was offering us, and he was very accommodating to our requests which was great. Our driver was Mr. Ravuth and he was fantastic. On the way to visit the temples he stopped by a small shop to get us a 9-pack of bottled water which was included in the cost and saved us the trouble of buying water at Angkor which tends to be very very overpriced.We finished visiting all temples around mid-afternoon and Mr. Ravuth was great in suggest some places to visit in town. We ended up going to the War Museum which was a great educational experience. At the end of our visit we had some questions but our guide had left with a new group and the only war veteran sitting near the entrance did not speak English. Mr Ravuth was kind enough to translate our questions into Khmer and get our questions answered.Overall we had a great day with Mr. Ravuth and we were all very happy with the service. My family is planning a trip to Cambodia next year and I will be sure to make our bookings with Angkor Tuk Tuk Travel again! :D"

He gave us a very authentic taste of Cambodian life and history. We traveled with kids and an 85 year old grandmother (in excellent shape, we have to mention). He was able to fashion activities that appealed to all. He is extremely knowledgeable about the history and culture of Cambodia. Most of all, he is sensitive to the unique needs of each tourist, designing a tour based on what you want to see not what he has planned. We appreciated his integrity and his warm personality. He shared personal stories that make the visit much more memorable.He had small kindnesses for us as travelers, thinking of our needs before we could identify them. He was particularly gifted with kids.I highly recommend Sokhum to anyone wishing to visit the wonderful country of Cambodia.Louise D,"

We met our first night in Siem Reap and since I only had time for a two day tour Vong offered suggestions and helped plan out the next two days. He picked us up at our hotel each morning and we spent each day seeing the most amazing sites Siem Reap has to offer. Vong planned out each day to perfection, was a fountain of information, always had ice cold water when needed and is the best photographer around. At the end of our last day we even went to his home where his wife cooked us a great meal and we got to meet his beautiful children.If you are going to Siem Reap I highly recommend Cobra tours, you will have a great time."

The first time I used his services was for a two day tour of Angkor Wat and the surrounding Temples. Cobra planned the itinerary perfectly, beating the crowds to the major Temples, allowing plenty of time to enjoy ourselves, taking in the sights, and photographing as much as we wanted without anyone else around. Cobra even provided guidance as to where to take the best photographs and took photos of all us, for us. Our second trip with Cobra, Cobra guided us to the more distance temples which were completely amazing!! Cobra picks you up and drops you off at the airport, provides cold bottled water, provides suggestions as where to eat (at clean restaurants), speaks very good English and a little Spanish and is a safe driver (which is important). Cobra's Tour service is Top Notch and I highly recommend him to anyone traveling to Siem Reap, Angkor Wat, and/or the surrounding Temples."

He was with another tour company when I used his services, but he would be wonderful with any company (and any company would be lucky to have him!). He is humble, friendly in a very low-key way, and very knowledgeable. From him I learned about the ancient history, the temples, the carvings and statues, and other local sights and wildlife. All that information could have been overwhelming, but he presented just the right amount and in such an engaging way \u2013 he's a natural teacher. Much of what I learned from him helped me understand ancient sites in other locations. Bunhak also provided an educated perspective on Cambodia more recent history. He took time to find out what interested me. He was funny, and kind and generous \u2013 and when we ran into my friends (who were touring on their own) he included them in our discussions and photo opportunities. He was also kind and generous with locals, both young and old.Bunhak speaks excellent English and is a skilled photographer, pointing out ideal locations and lighting, and often offering to take photos. And since he knows the area so well, he took me to hidden gems and quieter routes the crowds had not discovered \u2013 a relief in such a popular tourist attraction.I'm so glad I chose to get a professional tour, and particularly happy with Bunhak. Bunhak made the Angkor complex come to life, and I have a much better understanding of this cultural treasure. Bunhak is a gifted tour-guide. I very much appreciate that his company contributes to local nonprofit projects to improve education. If I return to this area, I will engage Bunhak again. Highly recommended!"

We usually do a lot of research before we travel, but in this case, we simply took the advice of a Canadian family we met at our hotel in Ho Chi Minh. They recommended a guide named Bunhak, a compassionate man with the reverence of a Monk and the knowledge of a wise scholar. In addition to a private tour, air-conditioned car, experienced guide- Bunhak and his partners use the money they earn to fund their own private school where almost 300 kids can learn English. In an area where tourism is blossoming, teaching kids English at an early age rather than them waiting to learn it in high school, is so valuable. Their work extends to doing outreach with orphans, the poor and more remote villages as well. It was great to know that by choosing Angor Helping Tour, we could be giving back to the community so directly. We booked three days with Bunhak - each day he had a thoughtful and comprehensive itinerary that included temple tours and a stop at a restaurant for lunch. We made our own hours - preferring to start early to avoid the heat and crowds, and were able to customize the schedule as we went along. Bunhak's reverence for the history and accomplishments of the Angor culture made the experience so valuable and rich! We were also treated to time with his partner Khemra - a lively and comedic guide who referred to himself as a second hand Bruce Lee since he had been a professional athlete. His lively conversation and presentation was the other end of the spectrum compared to Bunhak We liked that they each added their own personality to the tour without ever feeling overwhelmed by it. I can't praise these guys enough - their professionalism, their promptness, thoroughness, thoughtfulness, and especially the outreach work they are doing to give back to their community. Plus after seeing the hoards of tourists climbing in and out of big busses and others struggling on bikes, having our own personal car and guide made all the difference! Thank you Angor Tours for the trip of a lifetime!"

Mr. Heng is a very cautious driver, he ensures that his customers do not feel any hard jerks even when he is driving through the busier areas.He explained to us the different aspects of the lives of people living in the villages that we passed by.After we had covered Beng Mealea, he gave us packed wet napkins and another couple of water bottles.He did so after every spot where we spent a long time.He also stopped on the way where we could try the Kralan Cambodian sticky rice which we simply fell in love with.The next day, we visited Siem Reap/Ankor with him. We asked him to take us to a few temples that were not a part of the standard tour. He came up with a route that cover them with the best use of time.His service was again impeccable.We had promised him the day before that we will visit Apsara dance, but since we were very tired towards the end of our trip, we told him we won't be able to go there.He might have lost the opportunity to make a few dollars because but his service still stayed impeccable and he stayed as polite and helpful as before.One more thing, he is also a pro with the camera, he took some of our best pictures with our DSLR together in different modes that we don't even know about!All in all, he was one of the main reasons we came to love Siem Reap so much.Definitely recommend!"

Before our trip, we have read a lot of superb comments on Angkor United Tour via Tripadvisor. We emailed the company and Pal got back to us almost instantly. And with a just a few emails back and forth, we've worked out the itinerary. The itinerary will cover the 2nd, 3rd and 4th day of our visit (leaving the 1st and the last day for self-tour and relaxion). When we first met, which is the day we planned to see sunrise, Pal and our great driver Mr. Heng greeted us with a big smile, The night before, Pal even reminded us to ask the hotel if a breakfast box can be prepared since we shall need to head out very early in the morning. There was a long queue to get tickets but Pal show us where we can get a 3-days pass. The sunrise is marvelous. And since we have arrived Angkor Wat so early, the place is quieter than usual (also due to low season); and we were able to take a lot of good walking around, nice photos. We have never been able to take so many nice couple-photos before (and the selfie stick won't do as good a job as Pal certainly !) Pal knows exactly where and how to take good photos.We were worried at first about if it's a good idea to buy a 3 days pass and just to tour around temples but with Mr. Heng excellent driving service (he stopped right in front of every entrance, supplied us with ice cold water and towels), we've found touring all the temples are a great enjoyment. Pal gave very good and detail explanation of every places we visited. We learnt a lot of history, cultures, architect related and great stories of the ancient times. We feel great excitment on every places visited. He said we have visited 17 of them, big and small, but we didn't feel any overlap, every temples visited are unique and special !During lunch hours, Pal and Mr. Heng will take us to try out some local food but with a decent environment. Everyday, they will work with us and try to honor our requests no matter how early they started the day already or it's a bit late to the evening. They will never look at their watch and give you any signs/hints of 'it's getting late now, we have no time for this, next time' etc. Of course, we will not take advantage of their hospitality as it's a long working day for them driving us around/touring us around but this indicates how passionate they are in their job - customer satisfaction is their prime ! They may have to sacrifice their own time a bit just to meet our requests.On our last day, we have already started to discuss other places we can visit next time. Pal and Mr. Heng, four thumbs up are not enough for you guys ! My husband and I would really like to send our heartiest thanks for giving us such a wonderful and memorable time at the Kingdom of Cambodia ! Should we visit this place again, both of you and your company will be our top choice ! Wishing both of you and family all the best and look forward to an opportunity to visit again in the future !

If I had done it in a tuk-tuk I would have died of heat stroke, and Khemra and Bong Heng were very aware of keeping us hydrated and feeling good. Our itinerary had some very well-placed 30-minture car trips aka nap times in the middle of the day. - Speaking of itinerary planning, Khemra was super helpful, flexible, and responsive over email. I came to him with a list of attractions I was interested in and he helped me narrow it down, and rolled with the punches when I emailed the day before to push the departure time back 1.5 hours and then emailed him back to change my mind.- Khemra is like the mayor of Angkor Wat. Everywhere we went with him he was talking to other guides, shop sellers, and children. He makes friends with everyone and has a quick wit.- He also taught us some key phrases in the local language, which we used to great effect during the rest of our trip."

Stunning, less crowded, and mostly shaded.If I were to change anything, I would request he communicate the day's itinerary in more detail and/or provide a \"cheat sheet\" of the important names/destinations.

From sunrise at Angkor Wat to sunset overlooking the countryside, Bun Hak was informative, helpful, well spoken and made our experience worthwhile. As a teacher I am always anxious to learn about the temples, the country, the people and the history, and Bun Hak was so knowledgeable and able to answer all my questions and add his personal experiences. He showed us how to avoid the crowds, knew the best times and places to visit. As a final amazing experience, we visited the school that Mr. Bun Hak founded with his fellow guides, a wonderful addition to our vacation.Also, I would highly recommend our driver, Mr. Sam Bo- who also spoke great English and was always there with cold water and a cool, lemon scented washcloth after a hot visit to a temple. What a great combination? You cannot go wrong.A great guide, a great driver, and knowledge that they are helping the Cambodian children."

He is passionate about the area and explains in real clear English why the temples were built and also the history of the temples (both originally and after rediscovery).He determined quickly how to personalize our tour by stopping at farming activities and other special places we were interested in. He also led us to the most favorite picture spots. His tours are a little 'challenging' since he walks through and over places to get better angles and also see specific points of interest.If possible, spend 3 days touring the sites around Siem Reap.

Due the heat we hired tour guide, driver and car with a/c and a cooler with cold water always on hand. The car and driver seemed a luxury when my husband and I booked for the two of us - but very worthwhile. As an example, you get dropped off at one end of the temple area and picked up at the end, so you don't have to walk in and out, very nice! The driver waits at the end. We entered one temple from a more secluded spot through a forest hike with no other visitors \u2013 fab! Our guide Mr. Em Somuch was fantastic, as were are drivers. We learned all about history and current life. We were of a similar age, but our shared life stories were quite different. When in Cambodia it is crucial to understand the history (recent) and the struggles of the people. Our Itinerary consisted of a variety of temples, including the early morning sunrise over Angkor Wat and the floating villages. All trips were wonderfully guided with great photos. Bunhak will assist you in creating your perfect itinerary. This organization supports schools, students and teachers."

Having a local tour guide made a big difference, as he knew all the best spots to get pictures (and was pretty handy with our cameras) and could organize a walk-through in a temple so you always knew what path to follow. Two caveats to keep in mind when using such a local service:1.) These tour guides have seen these temples many times, so they may want to walk through faster than you care. If you want to meander, however, just let them know. Take the temples at your own pace.2.) Local guides have local biases. If you don't want to hear about some of the problems in Cambodia (gov't, other tourists, etc.) then this is not your best bet.That said, we still had a wonderful experience, and I would venture to say its well worth the money to get the most out of your limited time in this vast, amazing World Heritage Site."

Mr. Pal Saruon catered to our needs for a more flexible itinerary as we didn't want to visit all the temples. With him as our guide, we were able to avoid the crowd even though it was just one day after the Khmer New Year and there were still a lot of locals in town. And i really have to give credit to Mr. Pal Saruon for his photography skills. Throughout the tour, besides explaining the details of each temple, he was also the best photographer we could have on the trip. He basically directed us where and which angle to stand to get the perfect shot. It was just so much fun having him as our guide. He also provided great insight to the current day Cambodia. At the end of the tour, we learned that they are supporting a school that offers free English classes for local children with the money they earn. We would have love to visit the school had we known earlier. It was a bit too late as we fly out of Siem Reap the very next day. Thank you for the tour! =)"

After consulting the list of recommended drivers on a separate TripAdvisor page, Khemra was the first to respond and we quickly booked a day and a half tour, as well as airport transport to and from our hotel. Khemra unfortunately had a last minute obligation elsewhere, so he left us in the very capable hands of Pal Saruon. Saruon was excellent - he took us around Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Ta Prohm, a silk farm, as well as the reservoir by the airport which was also a sight to behold. All in all he was a boundless source of information, and answered all of our questions in detail, and had an unbelievable amount of knowledge about everywhere we visited. He was super friendly, accommodating of changing schedules and desires, and all together gave us an unforgettable experience in Siem Reap. It's hard to pick between many qualified guides in Siem Reap on TripAdvisor, but you can rest easy picking Angkor United Tours - they are the best! Could not have asked for a better experience - it's no wonder they have exclusively 5 bubble ratings here."

Fantastic conversation, knowledge and passion for his country. Always accommodating with any request, great sense of humour and always smiling. Khemra was also very flexible with some changes we made to our itinerary on the second day.We had the opportunity to have dinner at one their homes with the team (Khemra, Bunhak & Saruon) and had traditional Khmer food.They also are giving something back to local community by assisting children living in poverty with education, nutrition and a better quality life from the income derived from their tours, Very impressive and admirable considering they themselves are living very modestly.These guys are truly amazing and gave us an unforgettable experience which will cherish the rest of our lives. Not to forget our drivers who were excellent and very safe.We will be back in the near future and Angkor United Tours will be our first call.Thank you Khemra, Bunhak & Saruon."

Our trip to the Angkor temples was a bit out of the ordinary in that one of us is a competitive cyclist who needed to get some training miles under her belt while visiting Siam Reap and the Angkor complex. Khemra was a great guide and helped us put together an itinerary which got the serious miles done, but did it in conjunction with seeing the sights that make the area so special. He helped organise the right kind of bikes and the right kind of support vehicles and was endlessly patient riding for hours on a supporting tuktuk equipped with spares - and it was all organised at short notice in peak season.When it came to visiting the temples themselves Khemra was not only a wonderful guide but also a damn fine cameraman!.

In addition to the wondrous temple ruins, we spent a day at Khulen National Park where we met friends of Bunhak and had a chance to really see Cambodian life. We also took a cruise to Tonle Sap Lake to see life in both villages on stilts and the floating villages. Having an air-conditioned car for our touring made for a comfortable time and much needed respite from the heat. And every place we were taken for lunch served very good food.

The hotel booked a guide and tuk tuk for me and Bunhak, the guide, turned up. He spoke excellent English and used to work for Caritas Cambodia which has many excellent projects to empower poor people in the country still reeling from Khmer Rouge atrocities. Bunhak and other guides have banded together and they plough some of their profits from guiding into projects for orphans and other poor children in remote villages. Since I work in a similar field, we had a fascinating conversation. Given my limited time,Bunhak took me to the three Angkor Wat sites I most wanted to see and showed an encyclopedic knowledge of the amazing sculptures, pointing beyond those of gods, kings and demons to the ordinary Khmer people in the markets, looking after children etc. stretching back to the 8th century. By 3pm, the heavens opened and the rain was so heavy it was felling branches off the trees and so we had to run. Nevertheless, Bunhak's engaging style made my tour very fulfilling and enthused me so much that I bought three books about Khmer history. I also like the idea that some of my fee was going to help young kids in his own country. Highly recommended."

His USP is knowing where to go to avoid the crowds and to get the best photos (I think he spent more time holding our camera than we did!). As an example we visited one temple (Ta Phrom I think) via the West Gate and saw nobody else around, it was almost like discovering the temple for the first time. This happened quite a lot and its only when you return home and look through the pictures that you realise how good he is at finding the quiet spots & times to visit each temple / gate. Very knowledgable and informative. Really made our stay unique. So, to Bun Hak thank you for a great three days and some excellent photos.

The visit to the temples was also combined with an evening dance performance where some of the legends we had witnessed in the carvings of the temples were brought to life before our eyes. Khemra also introduced us to the local craft of palm sugar and sticky rice production, and also took us to the floating village on Tonl\u00e9 Sap which was like nothing we had ever seen before and where we were really able to come into contact with the local people. The five days culminated in a trip to the temple of Preah Vihear on the border with Thailand; an experience that will stay with us for ever.

It is an excellent tour that offers a very good view into Cambodian countryside life, which is very different from what you will see in Siem Reap. The tour guide (Sam Ath) was very friendly, entertaining and, most importantly, knowledgeable. You can really tell that this is someone who is very concerned with making a difference and improving the life of his country's citizens. Butterfly tours works with the local community to ensure that they get fairly rewarded for opening the doors to their home to show us the activities that they perform on a daily basis (basket weaving, rice wine distilling etc). As such, by taking part in this tour, you're not only contributing to a great local initiative but also contributing to the local countryside community.I wouldn't even recommend this as an alternative to the temples but really as something that stands on its own as a must-do while in Siem Reap."

            "review": "Worth another day in Siem Reap! (Off-Beaten Track Tour). If you're in Siem Reap, you're going to do what everyone does: see Angkor Wat. But what not every visitor might know is that a mere 20 minutes by bike outside the tourist-centric trap of Siem Reap lies a completely different, largely untraveled, and very rural other world. If you're not going to get to travel much around the country outside the cities, a tour like this is an eye-opening experience.Pros: Off the bat, our guide, Minea, was fabulous. Intelligent, energetic, thoughtful, and deeply interested in the history and politics of his country, Minea was my dream tour guide - the kind that will prolong a tour for quite a while if you're engaged, interested, and asking questions. Cambodian tourism is very backwards looking - to ruins and temples, to Killing Fields - and it was refreshing to get to talk to a local who was very focused on the now - the lifestyle and conditions of the average working Cambodian, the geopolitical problems facing Cambodia - as well as the future, on which Minea had a hopeful, determined gaze. It was nice to be outside and getting to bike, even though it was quite hot. (Bring water. Lots of it.) And some of the stops we made were deeply memorable: rice paddies, a local market, a personal rice wine distillery. And without doubt, the lunch we had with a local family, our discussions with them (during which Minea helped us a lot), and the unique dishes we had was the finest dining experience during our entire trip.Cons: Some of the stops along the way were really dumb, frankly. There was no reason to prolong the trip to stop at a seemingly random (other than it was on the way) Buddhist temple. Minea can also be a little...impassioned about his political convictions, which didn't bother me, but might come across to others as preachy. And be sure that your bike seat is set-up correctly before you take off - it's a long day of biking, and you'll want to be sure that you're comfortable, since the roads are not well-paved most of the time. The tour guides won't take care of that for you.Overall, the day spent with Butterfly Tours is one I consider as memorable as Angkor Wat in the morning and, in many ways, more culturally educational and enriching. Highly recommend."

Minion, our guide, was wonderful and very hospitable and professional. The story behind this company is very cool - it's a group of friends who all started the company together from the ground up after university and they work so hard. Minion took us off road to the rural areas of Siem Reap where we made 4 stops throughout the villages to learn firsthand how the locals live in Cambodia. He taught us about the local diets, and we tried some very interesting fruit and at each stop he was able to explain so much about each area in much depth. He was extremely knowledgable, spoke excellent English and was able to thoroughly answer our questions and have relevant conversations with us. I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Siem Reap, and hope we can come back and do another one soon. Thanks, Minion and Butterfly!"

A few days earlier, we had been on the Angkor Sunrise Discovery tour around the temples with Grasshopper Adventures. We liked it but it was relatively expensive at $85 each. This experience was far better.The full day Local Ways of Life Tour tour with Butterfly Tours was $111 in total for the 3 of us and we loved it! It was a far less touristy experience cycling through the countryside away from the well beaten track and having the opportunity to engage with local people in their villages. We went to a local market, spent time in the home of a basket weaver, had a guided tour around a local school hosted by a Korean educationalist, had dinner cooked for us by a village family, visited a village temple ..... and got caught in an extended rainy season downpour. (Make sure that you have a poncho with you, just in case!) We didn't see any other travellers during the whole time we were away from the main road.Bo, our Butterfly tour guide, was a delight. He is a part of a small group of young people who run the company with the aim of ensuring that the tours benefit the local community. He is still going to college at night and to pay for his studies he works all day on these bike tours.A brilliant adventure and an excellent company. Don't think twice about going with them."

After 3 days at the temples I was eager to meet some local people and see what life is really like for the Cambodian people. Our tour guide was amazing and we learned a lot about the \"real Cambodia\" from him. Overall, I went for the cultural experience- but the biking is fun too! We went to a woman's house and saw her weaving baskets. It was fascinating and we bought some to support her, as she only makes $5 a day or so. We saw rice fields and actually got to see them planting the rice! We also saw a water buffalo. We got to visit a local market and we were the only tourists in sight. Last we visited a rice wine distillery and could have tasted it, but I passed due to the heat! (If you are not good with heat, consider a half day rather than a full day, because the Cambodian sun is intense!)Definitely consider supporting this group of young people who have started this company and want to show tourists the real life of Cambodians! If you are in Siem Reap for the temples, don't neglect to do a tour like this to learn about the country and the people- it's so important!"

And our bicycle guide, Sopheap, took that seriously, watching out for her and taking good care while leading our pack of 3. Even the temple guide, Sopheak, ended up riding next to Ma like a bodyguard in traffic. We rode through beautiful forest, sheltered from the sun. We toured the major temples listening to Sopheak. We visited rural villages and gave out little gift packs we brought... We were slow and caused some delay in competing the itinerary. But our guides remained very patient with us. And for that, we are extremely thankful.Thank you, Butterfly Tours. For a different kind of experience in a holiday. Thank you for the adventure.

It was so nice to finally be able to get an answer to all my questions about local life and Cambodia.The villages were pretty and people very friendly. They were able to get a baby seat for the bike.The only downside in my opinion is the price and the fact they charge 70% of the adult price even for infants (which is a first to me, especially because they don't ride bikes, talk, eat and so on). I think they should consider to lower the charge for children below 3. The price for 2 people and an infant came to 51 USD for 3/4 hours tour. Which I found it okay since we had basically a private tour but if I had to be in a group I would have found it too pricey for Cambodia."

Upon arrival we transitioned to an oxcart and were able to observe and experience the Cambodian way of life. Interestingly, my sister and I saw our tuk tuk driver at home playing with his children in the yard, he was surprised we recognized him, but we exchanged a hello. I cannot say enough positive things about our tour guide, Bo. He was well-versed on a variety of topics and his English was impeccable. I learned so much about Cambodian culture, politics, agriculture, healthcare, holidays, family life, history, and so much more from him. He was also eager to learn about U.S. culture, customs, and figures of speech like, \"I have the travel bug.\" His positive attitude was infectious and definitely made the tour memorable. The oxcart made stops at a food market, a rice wine maker, and a basket weaver. Each stop provided an opportunity to meet locals and gain an understanding about what life is like in Cambodia. The return ride by bicycle to the office is primarily through the village and the scenery is incredible.

The countryside is really beautiful and you will meet many Cambodians on your way to different destinations they take you to and appreciate their beautiful smiles. This is real Cambodia, guys! The tour includes watching basket making, visiting a market and a rice wine homemade factory- and this is what I appreciated the most about this tour- unlike too many tour operators Butterfly tours do NOT push you at all to spend money on anything (like buying a basket) so you feel really free about whether you are willing to spend those couple of additional dollars on your way (and I actually did having experienced the kindness of people I met), so you really are relaxed about everything you see and don't get the \"too commercial\" attitude. They actually pay for your water and snacks on the way(which are delicious). The tour is suitable for \"from time to time\" bikers and the bikes themselves are very good quality so it is easy to ride. You also get a helmet. All in all if you have a spare couple of hours in Siem Reap and want to experience something truly authentic, this is it! Also, the prices are very honest and it is much cheaper than the concurrence.

            "review": "Awesome Tour to See The Real Cambodia. My wife and I took the 'Off The Beaten Track' half day tour last February. There were only 2 other people in the tour (a nice American couple) and we all seemed to hit it off pretty well from the start. The tour guide (sorry I forgot the name after so long!) was such a cool guy he made everyone feel at ease and made sure we were safe the whole time. We could not have asked for a better guide!The best part of this tour is getting off the main roads (as the tour name suggests) and seeing how the local people live in the villages. It's amazing how things that I wasn't really looking forward to were such amazing highlights for me; like the basket weaving ladies. Their work is so perfect down to the finest detail, and they take such pride in it, it really was a pleasure to spend some time with them and ask them all sorts of questions about their craft. Be sure to bring some spare cash with you to buy some items (not expensive at all), we still have our little baskets and every time I look at them it takes me back to that shaded little pergola. Other stops were just as interesting, such as the rice wine making farm. Although our attention was stolen by the humongous pigs that were kept at the farm! Man, these pigs are massive! We tried some of the rice wine, can't say I'll be heading down to my local liquor store to pick up a bottle any time soon but it was still cool to see how it's made and taste the final product. It gets the local lads drunk for 50 cents so who am I to criticize the taste?Riding through the villages really gives you a feel like you are back in time. There's no electricity, no iPhones, no laptops, just farming and kids making do with what they have. One thing that really stuck in my mind was a little boy about 5 years old walking down the road pulling along a little cart made out of a coke bottle slit down the middle with wooden wheels and some rocks in it, and that's all he needed to keep him entertained. It really puts things into perspective.There were some other stops that I haven't mentioned that were just as insightful and it was really one of the highlights of our trip in S/E Asia.The journey itself, the guides, the seamless operation, the locals; it was all just an amazing half day adventure that I will never forget. To our guide (sorry I forgot your name!) - thank you so much and hopefully one day we will be back! :)Troy"

Super friendly, positive guys with good English and easy going laid back attitude.If you want to see a little bit of the country outside Siem Reap that is not the temples this is the way to do it.Travel at a nice leisurely pace with as many stops as you want (or if you don't want to stop either just keep on rolling) on mountain bikes that are kept in good condition.Even the what can be cheesy, touristy stops at a local market and basket weaver are interesting and not pushy at all. A nice simple lunch cooked by a local family is a nice pause in the middle of the journey.Guides are knowledgable and passionate about their job and their country and will discuss any topic you raise (we even got into Cambodian politics).Give these guys a go. Young locals who are making a real effort to show you a bit more of the \"real\" Cambodia."

But it didn't feel like being on a tour, more like two friends taking a ride through the country side.We went to a local market as well and tried rainbow cake, mangos and something like rice-coconut-dumplings. Very yummy!I got to see how baskets were made and even helped out a little.The highlight was definately watching the sunset somewhere in the middle of nowhere on some fields. A spontaneous idea, as I had mentioned that I like watching sunsets.Water was inculded on the whole tour.The bike tour was one of the best things I did throughout my trip in Southeastasia!"

From the get go, they introduced themselves, the company and got to know our names. Boh led the group at the front and Vat was at the back, both would engage us in conversation and learn more. The thing about guides is that they're not obliged to want to know about you and just do their job, but Boh and Vat were really genuine. Although Cycling on the road might sound scary, Boh would stop traffic for us to make turns/change sides. They would constantly check on each of us and ensure we were all okay. Never once did I feel that my safety was at stake. Ice cold bottled water was also bought for us along the way so we never felt dehydrated.2. Attractions you wouldn't read about in guidebooksWe got to visit a golden temple, see the countryside, visited a mushroom farm, a lotus farm, and scaled a relatively small mountain (there are steps!) to view the sunset. These are slices of Cambodian life you don't get without leaving the main part of the city.Plus, they bought banana fritters for us which was a great snack for the sunset! 3. 2-way Transport to the tour HQ provided Tuktuks picked us up to and fro so we didn't have to worry about finding our way there As this is a locally owned private company, they are really invested to provide a good tour and good service. Their friendly and outgoing personalities made it extra enjoyable too. At the end, they asked us for honest feedback which we had nothing negative to say. Do go and support their business! :)"

Ath came by to pick me up (on time), then introduced me to the rest of the Butterfly team and my guide of the day, Vathana. Because I was going solo, there was more flexibility in the program; Vathana and I ended up exploring paddy fields and lotus ponds, gazing at lots of cows (I was the one mainly doing the gazing, really), popping by villages, buying and eating really yummy food from the local market, and sampling rice wine before heading home. To say that the tour was fantastic would be an understatement. I had an incredible time with Vathana, who took such good care of me. Attentive at all times but also great fun (and funny), we shared a lot of laughs and chatted about a variety of things throughout the tour. Upon returning, the Butterfly team even shared their lunch with me, a gesture that truly touched me. I felt like I had met my long lost Cambodian family. But this gesture also reflects the kind of company Butterfly Tour is - inclusive, fun, incredibly kind. I would highly, highly recommend this tour. Besides being a fun and unique tour to do, Butterfly Tour also works towards the betterment of young Cambodians, supporting aspiring entrepreneurs and students - a truly great cause. "

Our guide, Sam-Ath, was the friendliest, nicest guy and he gave us a great understanding of Cambodian life as we talked and rode from the city into the surrounding countryside. Along the way, we stopped at a local market to try some native fruit and snacks, met a family of basket weavers, visited a pig farm and rice wine maker, and even rode through the village where Angelina Jolie is set to film her new movie. Sam-Ath was always receptive to our needs and a great companion for the day. The rest of the staff was super nice too, and the door-to-door tuk tuk service from our hotel was perfect.

You will not stumble across these back waters by chance and a pedal bike is a brilliant way to explore. We definitely would recommend butterfly tours to anyone without hesitation, just do it!The bikes are Chinese imports and that just adds to the character. Wat was very patient and considered in his responses to all of our questions, a well educated and well brought up young man, his parents and all his family are farmers he is the first university student who works hard to pay the bills. He is proud of his background and visibly beams with pride when talking about the farming communities."

I loved the idea of working with local university students, helping them to improve their English language skills. Wathana was excellent company and already his English is brilliant. We swapped stories about our home and it felt like we were just having a friendly conversation rather than some sort of social history lesson (which these things can sometimes feel like). The cycling itself isn't very hard even in very hot conditions as it is mostly flat. Half day is about 25kms and this was right distance for me."

They pay the villagers a small amount for letting us explore their homes/markets, but you're never pressured to do or buy anything. It's very, very genuine and authentic. I would recommend this 100%. We were going to book with Beyond Adventures, but they were full. I'm actually happy they were! I can't imagine a better tour than what we got. We generally like to explore outside cities and do \"non-traditional\" things while traveling. This absolutely fit the bill.The biking was perfect--flat. It's good for any ability. It was about 20 minutes outside SR proper. I almost forgot--we visited a little food markets where the villagers buy their food for the day. We got to try all the fruit, which was great, since we didn't know how to eat them. I would absolutely do this, or another tour, with them. Borith and Theary were simply fantastic.

Our guide was really fun and knowledgable. He gave us a brief history of Cambodia. Water provided too. We got off the beaten track and saw a different side of Siem Reap. Anyone can do this tour...wasn't too strenuous at all. Definite highlight of my trip."

It was so good to go way out into the countryside and see a real slice of Cambodian life, something it can be difficult to do in Siem Reap or other large cities. From seeing small local farms and crafts to tasting delicious and strange foods at the local market it was entertaining and informative from start to finish.Add this to your Siem Reap itinerary, it will definitely be one of the highlights of your whole Cambodia trip."

The good thing about this trip is there was only my partner and I on it - and still for the same price. So if your lucky it will be like a private tour!! The cycle was lovely not hard at all as it is all on flat ground. We stopped at several places along the way and got to mix with the real locals. We came out of this trip with a lot of knowledge about Cambodian way of life, some history and a lot of laughs!! Well worth it."

We went into the countryside and visited villages, watched basket making, learnt all about growing rice and making rice wine - too strong for me!! Passed a few village weddings on the way. If you want something different whilst in Siem Reap, try this! Inexpensive too!"

And many other interesting sights along the way. We were provided with sufficient cold water and some snacks during the tour. We loved the fried bananas and the fresh exotic fruits such as Tamarind. We had a little confusion after booking through email whether our tour was morning or afternoon but this was cleared up with a phonecall - we reached SamAth who speaks English very well. We were promptly collected by TukTuk from our hotel at 7:30 in the morning and brought to the Butterfly base station. They had regular bikes and mountainbikes, we used the latter, they were good although it did pay off to check the tires for pressure before we set off."

We had spent 2 days admiring the amazing temples, but we're looking to get away from the crowds and this couldn't of been more perfect. We joined a couple of young girls touring from Brisbane and joined Sam our very knowledgable tour guide and set off to the countryside just outside of Siam Reap. It was flat and the bikes were comfortable and we took it at an easy pace. Throughout our tour we saw the locals living their life and met some of them and are from a local market. We took some great photos and Sam answered all of my questions so we learnt so much about the Cambodian way of life. Couldn't recommend more, go for it!"

I did this bike tour almost a week ago now and I haven't stopped raving about how great it was thanks to Vathana :)This bike tour was fantastic because it gave me the chance to see what real life is actually like in Cambodia. I did a morning tour with Vathana and he was awesome- he spoke great English and was always asking me what I liked and what else I wanted to see. I am a school teacher so he took me by a few Cambodian schools which was amazing! The bike ride is nice and easy and at your own pace. You can stop as much as you want to and you can have water and snacks along the way. The price is unbeatable!All of the tour guides are so friendly and funny which made the trip. I highly recommend this trip to anyone who would like to explore the local lifestyle- I will never forget it :)"

After a couple of full days of temple touring, we wanted to see more of the authentic Cambodian countryside away from the hoards of tourists. We were not disappointed! We booked the day before and ended up having a private tour with Sam Ath as our guide. We learned a lot from him! Cannot beat the price either! Highly recommended! Also- we were a bit worried about how strenuous the biking would be in the heat, but it wasn't bad at all. Sam Ath went at our pace, and we took plenty of breaks! Thanks again for the great tour!!"

Our guide Bunsorng spoke very good English and explained in detail the sights and working processes.

After you have seen the temples this is a great way to get away from the tourist attractions and see things only a few visitors to Cambodia will, such as how local people live, and how different local products (e.g. baskets, rice wine, rice noodles) are made. A very hands-on tour as well as you can have a go at doing different things and ask loads of questions, which Borith happily answered as well as acting as a translator if we had any questions for the local people. Also, even though we saw a lot of produce, this wasn\u2019t a tour that was intended to make you buy things, which was also a great change from other tours we had been on. At 11 USD per person this is great value for money as well as a lot of fun! Visited January 2015."

The staff's knowledge and enthusiasm was really top notch, and their command of the English language was far better than many tour guides I encountered on my travels through Asia. The ride through the country side was lovely, and it was very interesting to see how the locals live and earn a living. It was such a contrast to Siem Reap (downtown) which is so busy and touristy; this was a wonderful escape for half a day.I appreciate that they have paid attention to small details like stopping for drinks during the ride, and offering cold drinks and cold towels at the end of the tour. For an additional $2, I was picked up and dropped off at my hotel which was more than reasonable considering a tuk-tuk would have cost $2 one way. I also like that they limit the tour size to a maximum of 6 participants. It meant having interesting conversations with the guides (who were just as interested in learning about my culture, as I was theirs) and getting all of your questions answered along the way. Bravo Butterfly Tours! Keep up the good work!"

We are a family of 4, and we all thoroughly enjoyed the tour. The 23kms bike tour is on local bikes, and you travel on a main road out of siem reap for a few Kms, before you turn onto the country tracks. The tracks are a bit bumpy etc, but the whole journey is on flat ground, with quite a few stop off points to visit the small local family run business, markets, water stops etc. It is good to see them support small family run enterprises. All of the local people you come across are very friendly. Our guide Sam Ath was very good, and as this company is run by university students, they all spoke good English. For only $13 dollars per person, including tuk tuk collection and drop off, it is a fantastic way to spend the morning. Our youngest son, never stopped talking to Sam Ath all the way.

Another girl mentioned loving fresh coconuts and he surprised her with one at the end. We got to go up and meet many local people in the countryside and experience how they make their living and livelihood. As the only native English speaker on the tour, Borith asked me to correct him if he said anything wrong! We had fun teaching him new colloquial sayings as he taught us about the Khmer people.

Wathana and Sam Ath (sorry for misspellings!) were very interesting, enthusiastic tour guides. They picked us up on their motorbikes as we were walking back to the office from lunch. Our group of 6 (4 guests and 2 guides) did a leisurely 4-hr bicycle ride through the Siem Reap countryside, passing by local villages, rice paddies, rattan workshops, duck and fish farms. We learned how Cambodians manually plant and harvest rice, and traditional methods of producing rice noodles and rice wine. We stopped at a small market and sampled some delicious bananas. We watched water buffalo graze and the sun beginning to set in the late afternoon. The only drawback of the tour was that our visit coincided with the national Water Festival, so the countryside was much quieter than usual, as farmers were spending the holidays in town. Overall, this tour was very affordable and supports a great student initiative -- it was a wonderful experience and one of the highlights of our trip!"

We did the half day tour in the morning, and rode for four hours through the most beautiful countryside. My boyfriend and I just moved here, so the tour guides (who were the sweetest boys....), helped me practice Khmer, and taught us all about the people and the history of Siem Reap. We stopped to weave baskets (with the nicest local ladies), get snacks (including the freshest fruit which is cut up for you immediately), see the process of making rice noodles, and taste rice wine. They let us go at our own speed, and even stopped when we passed certain points where we wanted to get extra pictures. We also got to laugh and smile with all the young kids coming home from school who were thrilled to shout \"HELLO!\" as we rode by. I will honestly never forget this experience."

The tour is a 3-4 hours bike ride in the cambodian countryside, with stops at local market, farms and small family run businesses where guests can see how some quintesentially cambodian products like rice wine or rice noodles are produced.It's an amazing way to take a distance from the beauty of the temples and reflect on it in an astonishingly beautiful environment and with two lovely people who have thorough explanation and little stories at every stop.I absolutely loved this tour and will definitely take it again when I'm back!"

You spent around four hours biking through the countryside outside Siem Reap with local guides who are super friendly and keen to show and tell you about Cambodian life - the real deal. You see beautiful countryside and visit villages and people's homes, including that of a local basket weaver who makes exquisitely intricate baskets, a Lbokotar (Cambodian version of Muay Thai boxing) studio where young guys are becoming fighting pros (hugely impressive!), and a rice wine making family, who welcome you into their home to show you how rice wine is made. All of these experiences, plus seeing the villages, the countrside and chatting to the local guides made this an unforgettable part of my trip and one I would recommend to anyone who has the chance to visit Siem Reap. Totally worth the cost of just around $12 or so, if I remember correctly."

You spend only 15 dollars sometimes they have discounts depends on the day of the week, you will experience fresh air, a real Cambodian village and rice plantation with real nice Cambodian guides! They are friendly and very humble, and safe to go anywhere, if you are female solo traveling alone! If safety is issue number One! I have spent early morning from 7 to 12 and it was amazing! We bicycle all the way, so healthy! We saw the village people, small bazaar selling local fruits and food, you will see a beautiful temple, a lot of village people and you witness how they stay and live in most simplest way of living. I am naturally afraid of dogs (kind of phobia) and I surprised that dogs did not spoil my trip. If you are like me, do not worry. Because they (dogs) are really friendly! :) Thanks God! You will go for hand made baskets maker and her family. You must buy one of her baskets for memory and by doing so, you support her and her family's living! You will also experience how they make rice wine and you have a chance to try it! I am not trying to advertise here, but its really worth of your money and time! Cambodia is a place where simplicity and harmony is everywhere! If you like bicycling and dont mind to wake up early, this is just for You! Trust me!"

Yes the temples are nice and what everyone comes here for but this tour takes you into the heart of the life of the rice farmers villages and their way of life. The ride is easy and the bike seats are quite comfortable. Our guide Sam Ath was very knowledgable on every aspect of the life of the villagers that we came into contact with. From the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge to the life of today's farmers his knowledge was really good. He has a unique trust and understanding of the farmers and with this trust he was able to take us into the homes of the local people showing us first hand how their lives and how their livelihood has changed very little over the generations. Sam Ath's dedication to the cause of helping local villagers improve their way of life really stood out on this tour. The tour really opened our eyes as to how well we have life in the developed western World. Amongst all this we came away with some amazing photographs and memories. Thankyou Sam Ath we will be recommending your tour all of our friends who travel to this wonderful country."

The whole group only two of us and the two guides from Butterfly. it was easy and relaxing. We rode on the roads among the rice fields and local houses. They took us to the families who we do cooking with them, and lunch in their house. it was a nice chat with the people and see how they make their livings.

I can\u2019t speak highly enough of this trip. Pickup on time from hotel by tuk yuk arranged by them. Sam Nath and Sopheap (our guides) were very sweet, well educated and worldly, really enthusiastic and knowledgable, idealistic but realistic, and really fun to hang out with. The tour I took was only it\u2019s second day of being in operation in Siem Reap although I believe they\u2019ve been operating out of Battambang for a couple of years). Apart from the interesting things we did - visiting home based businesses making noodles, rice wine and baskets in small hamlets along the way, having a go at planting rice, and having lunch at a small roadside stall - which were a unique opportunity you definitely don\u2019t get on the usual touristy tours; for me the most impressive thing was the sincerity and warm hearts of our guides and their genuine interest in having you see another side of Cambodia that you don\u2019t normally see as a tourist. Lunch (at the roadside stall) and all the water you need supplied. The altruist in me liked the fact that they passed on some money to the locals for our visit (but I didn\u2019t feel at all like a voyeur, or that things were staged, which turns me off more commercialised ventures) together with their grassroots philosophy of empowering Cambodians to gain the confidence of setting up their own businesses (using Butterfly Tours as a model) with a plan to expand the concept to other areas. That\u2019s where the name of the company comes from - the metamorphosis that a butterfly undergoes symbolising what they hope to achieve for their country. See http://www.butterflytour.asia/about-us.html as I am finding it hard to do it justice. Thanks again guys for a great experience. Contact: butterflytour.sr@gmail.com"

This young bunch of current and newly graduated university students are passionate about developing jobs and, more importantly, entrepreneurial opportunities for young Cambodians. I think that is why they are so dedicated to ensuring you have a great experience. Sam Ath was very knowledgable about Cambodia and business in Cambodia. As we rode through several communities, Sam Ath explained to me the industries within these areas and how the families working them are impacted by the weather, government policies and foreign investment; he knows his stuff! He introduced me to rice wine distilling, basket weaving and how this industry was impacted by the Khmer Rouge era, Khmer rice noodle making and of course rice production from the fields. I highly recommend this tour either for a better understanding of the wider Siem Reap communities, or just a fun day out meandering around the beautiful Siem Reap countryside. The bikes are comfortable and cruisy and very easy to ride. With this tour you can relax as all arrangements are carefully organised and your comfort is their priority. Oh and as a solo female traveller, you can rest assured you will be in good hands from pick-up to drop-off at your accommodation."

While the temples complex around Angkor Wat amazed me by their beauty and magnificence, it is the Butterfly Bicycle Tour that remained my favorite activities while I was there. Cambodian countryside is more than beautiful, with borderless paddy fields, green trees and friendly people. We got to talked to many villagers, learnt about how they lived and worked. We also got chance to try making the basket from palm leaf, visit the training class for Cambodian boxing and try rice wine. What made the tour more than memorable and enjoyable was the hospitality and friendliness of our tour guides. As university students, they speak fluent English, kind and sweet. We learnt a lot about Cambodia by talking to them. If you want to experience something more than touristy crowd and services around Pub Street area, this tour is the one to choose. Something very different, and something worths experiencing :). To our beloved tour guides: Wish you a successful future ahead with the company as well as your study. And keep your authenticity, friendliness and sincerity regardless of how popular you will be in the future ;)."

Our guides happily tailored our ride to be a bit shorter as we had a plane to catch and were wonderfully flexible. Having the opportunity to ride and chat with such energetic, passionate and smart young students allowed us a fantastic chance to learn more about Cambodian culture and politics - something that most other tours cant offer.

I visited Siem Reap in November 2015 arriving at the airport very late afternoon and was very fortunate to be allocated a fantastic cab driver for the trip to our hotel. He suggested a that a private tour guide might be a good idea given my limited mobility (I am a wheelchair user but can walk short distances with crutches) and we agreed that a driver, van and personal tour guide would be of benefit getting around the many attractions in the area.Next morning at breakfast we were advised that our driver and guide were waiting for us and so began our amazing week in Siem Reap and surrounding areas. As we set off, we got to know our tour guide Mr Seng Bunly and he us; it was very clear that I in particular wanted to take in as much of the local culture as possible. Angkor Wat and other temples were a high priority and the rest of our trip was arranged by Mr Bunly (a thoroughly decent and considerate young man with extensive knowledge of the temples and area in general as well as Cambodian history and culture. His command of the English language was refreshing as was his enthusiasm to share his vast knowledge with visitors to Cambodia.We got a three-day ticket for Angkor Wat and Mr Bunly ensured that unnecessary distances were avoided so as to make life a tad easier for me with the air conditioned van meeting us at different points along the way (always with icy cold bottled water available for us). He even became my photographer and took some really great shots along the way.We did the boat trip to see the Tonle Sap lake floating village (I have no idea how he managed to accommodate my physical limitations and get me on the boat but he did), and visited a local temple/monastery as well as a visit to the silk factory, the Siem Reap vocational training centre for people with a disability and a visit to Suong village (by water buffalo drawn cart). A shopping trip was also arranged for us and we toured the township of Siem Reap and surrounding areas.I\u2019ve kept in touch with Seng Bunly since leaving Siem Reap and believe I have gained a lifelong friend, he is so much more than a Tour Guide as he genuinely wants to share the beauty and history of wonderful Cambodia. He is involved in volunteer humanitarian work in several rural villages on the outskirts of Siem Reap where most tourists never bother to visit (I highly recommend a visit to Suong Village by water buffalo drawn cart).I cannot recommend Bunly Tours Agency highly enough for their attention to detail, their wonderful attitude and uncanny ability to design individual itineraries which match the desires and needs of the client.Six stars out of five.Eleven stars out of ten."

We based the itinerary on their 18 day tour but then asked for some changes based on things we wanted to do. The holiday and tour were excellent from start to finish. Our tour guide and driver (Heng and Toch) were available, friendly and professional right from the start and before long became more like friends as we went through the tour. Even getting lost looking for hotels gave us all a few smiles and unscheduled 'city tours'. The hotels booked for us were all perfect and as we told them we wanted to get as much local experience and culture as we could they managed to mix in a lot of streetside eating and home visits with friendly hospitable families.Heng and Toch were away from their families for almost three weeks to tour with us but still made themselves fully available for changes and extra itinerary suggestions that we made. When the boats out to the islands were unable to sail they drove us to a nearby beach that we said we would like to visit and they then waited all day until we were ready to leave.Overall from our experience I can strongly recommend booking with Bunly Tours if you want to experience the real Cambodia and our thanks to everyone involved arranging it - especially our friends Heng and Toch."

Nearly two years after an outstanding visit (May, 2013) to Cambodia, I recall pleasant memories and fascinating details of the many temples visited under the expert guidance of Mr. Bunly. While he specializes in the Siem Reap/Angkor Wat area, his referral also brought me to an excellent guide and driver who showed me the beauty of Phnom Penh. Mr. Bunly's personalized tours assured me of seeing and understanding the best of the region. Great local Khmer cuisine (which has to be the world's best-kept culinary secret) was enjoyed at many great local restaurants off the typical tourist path. The local culture, customs, religion, and food were beautifully incorporated into what could have been an average tour with anyone else. Mr. Bunly's \"visitor intuition\" made all the difference! Take this from someone who has visited over 75 countries, in over 40 years of global travels."

My friend and I spent a week in Siem Reap, more than enough time to see the temples and enjoy ourselves. He is 30 and I 40, and we both like the nightlife as well as seeing cool stuff. So we were looking for a way to see the temples while avoiding the crowds, getting lost, and generally all the other potential pitfalls of visiting dozens of temples with endless passageways, in the extreme heat, with no end of people paying more attention to their cameras or phones than the actual temples. So when Bunly came highly recommended to us by some new friends at our small hotel, we were quick to contact him and book a couple of days. Bunly met us at our hotel in the morning with a tuk tuk and driver. We proceeded to head off to the temples. Bunly was thoroughly knowledgeable about the Khmer Empire, as well as contemporary politics in Cambodia. He was quick with a joke, quick to offer us water, and always made sure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. Perhaps most importantly, he knew all the back routes and times when crowds would be arriving, so we were able to enjoy much of the temples with very few other people around. As many of the passageways are quite narrow, and the best photo ops don't have people in them, it was super nice to be able to take in the grandeur and mystery of these ancient sacred places in relative quiet and comfort. Bunly took us to all of the main temples over two days, and a few smaller ones. By the end of day two, he was more like a friend than a guide. You can probably find a cheaper way to see the temples, but you won't find a better bargain for the level of service, knowledge, kindness and fun. Highly recommended."

He knows the best routes around the area to avoid big crowds and is very good at judging your interests after a couple of hours. He is friendly and shares a bit about his own interesting life if you ask. I am a fairly adventurous traveler but after many days on the road, I was worn down and needed to take it a little bit easy for a day, while still wanting to see Angkor. Mr. Bunly met me at my hotel the night before and we planned the day. I opted for a air conditioned car, which I do not regret one bit as it was scorching hot. There was water waiting in the car whenever I needed it. I felt a bit spoiled but a small bit of luxury allowed me to see more and do more. He is wonderful. I would never want to go with anyone else."

Mr Makara and Mr Haut were our guides and were very knowledgeable, professional and courteous. They had lots of interesting information for us about the temples and sites we visited but they were also very willing to answer our questions and share thoughtful views about a wide range of topics on Cambodia's history, government, economy, religion, relationships with neighbouring countries, social issues, culture and food. They also provided cultural advice about appropriate behaviour eg when we visited a pagoda on a religious festival day.Mr Bunly was very willing to make adjustments to fit in unscheduled activities for sub groups such as the Cambodian Circus night and visit to the Land Mine museum.One of the most interesting activities was a Khmer cooking lesson at the home of a family in a rural village.This experience gave us the chance to have a warm and personal exchange with the family, and to learn something of their daily life.As far as any suggestions for future tours, I think that other experiential activities like the cooking lesson would be great because they are actively engaging (egs craft, singing, dancing lessons). Theatre or music performances and contemporary art exhibitions if available would also be great ideas.I felt very lucky to have the chance to learn so much on the tour. I highly recommend Bunly tours."

Mr Bunly co-ordinated everything in a warm and professional approach. We liked both our tour guides, Mr Makara in Phnom Penh and Mr Haut in Siem Reap. They had a great depth of knowledge and were able to communicate to us clearly. Each gave us a good introduction to what we were seeing. They were able to provide more information as we asked questions and discussed issues with them. They also took care of our group and were very helpful in all details, such as making sure we always had cold water available and access to suitable toilets.The guides also kept the group together well by directing us to particular points of interest but also allowing free time at most places so people could wander at their own pace. We visited a lot of places, but were never made to feel hurried. The standard of the hotels and the transport was good, and the driver took good care of us.The meals were wonderful.As the organiser of the tour I was so pleased that I was able to use the services of Bunly Tours.This was the first time I had organised a group such as this, and I initially was unsure where to start. But after seeing the range of itineraries and activities offered on Bunly Tour website, and their very competitive prices, I was able to plan for our group of 13 people. I initially had concerns about organising a tour with a company where there was no Australian based contact person, but it was absolutely no problem. Pre-tour Mr Bunly and his staff provided prompt and informative responses to my many email enquries. Mr Bunly had great attention to detail which gave me confidence, as he clarified and very politely helped correct my errors - such as when I gave a wrong date when asking him to book a special meal for us in Siem Reap and I left off one person's name from the accommodation list. Mr Bunly was so flexible and provided everything he said he would- and more such as getting us last minute tickets to the circus at Siem Reap. He made sure that we got the meals we required as one person had special dietary needs. He was available regularly throughout the tour, making sure all arangements went smoothly. Our group enjoyed every day of the trip. The home cooking experience was one highlight, and the family gave us a warm welcome - and we enjoyed another delicious meal!I highly recommend Bunly Tours, really great value for money and wonderful service."

The guide will make sure you see enough. Some of the temples are very very big so be prepared to be astounded or just amazed at how humans could make something like this. One unexpected bonus was that water and cold towels were provided by the service. The talk truckdriver knew where to go for lunch so we had an inexpensive local lunch. $10 each. Fish curry, spring rolls, vegetarian fried rice, tea and a watermelon smoothie.We wore thongs, shorts and short sleeved shirts. Guide said that would be ok. It was. It is not a religious tour. Ignore all the sellers. They are not persistent. Pay the hotel for the tuk tuk and the guide later No fuss."

Mr Bunly had pateience as I took my time exploring the temples, he carried my bags when I was tired and most importantly ensured that I did not get \u201ctempled out\u201d by keeping the temple facts relevant and interesting without overkill. He was great company during our full day tour, and went out of his way to show me areas and aspects of Angkor that most people would never see, whilst avoiding all the crowds and tourist crowds! He planned the day based on my input/desires so I can vouch that Bunly caters for all and makes it all possible, so you see the not-to-be-missed sights and parts of Angkor that are not on the \u2018beaten tourist path.\u2019 His English is impeccable and he has a good sense of humour. Last to mention, the prices for a private tour was very, very reasonable and is highly recommended, as it is exclusive and tailored to your every need and allows for some quiet time at the temples, and good pictures.Honestly, I would not only recommend Bunly tours for every person travelling to Cambodia but I know I will undoubtedly use him for my future travels there.

During our 3days trip, even under such extreme weather (40-41 degree Celcius), he has manage to make our trip around Siem Reap as comfortable as possible by providing cold drinks and cool towel, even bought us fruits. He knew exactly which spot in the temple to take the best shot of pictures, which I think it saves us loads of time, he will even recommend what time is best to visit to avoid big crowd. As our driver, he even took the initiative to explains the history of each temple to us before we our visit. By 2nd day he is more like a friend to us than a driver. Conclusion: you won't regret knowing this friend"

I am pleased by the professional services provided by them as they explained to me about the histories of the temples in the Ang Kor City and also on the boat trip while visiting Tonle Sap. Comfortable transportation provided by them and bringing me to local food was a value add for my tour.

We had the best day exploring the siem reap countryside and villages. Dany took us the market for a look around and breakfast. We got to eat loads of things that I would never have probably noticed or been to scared to try whilst on my own. We then went to many different villages, and witnessed hand made crafts such as rattan basket weaving, fish traps, hand rolled incense sticks, blacksmithing, rice noodles, rice wraps, tofu making plus many more. We tried \"cupping\" locally which was fun. The people were inviting and friendly. We didn't feel pressured to purchase anything and were able to take lots of very memorable photos. Definitely do this tour. I can't recommend it highly enough. We decided to do the floating village tour another day, and was yet again blown away by Dany and his driver, who again showed us part of Cambodia away from the tourists. We had a boat to ourselves, and were allowed to sit on the deck and just watch this amazing community go about their daily lives."

I joined him and a couple from Singapore, and together we got a real taste of local life in Siem Reap. I would recommend this tour to anyone looking for that extra special experience to top off your visit to Cambodia. Highlights for me included:- eating freshly prepared tofu (made from scratch right in front of us) - food tasting in the local market (unlike markets I've been to in other parts of Asia) - cupping (traditional therapy that has been getting attention recently because of Olympic athletes who have used it... Except on this tour it cost just a fraction of the regular price!) - meeting the locals and seeing first-hand what they do for a living (including basket weaving, joss stick/incense making, etc.) - and more... Dani made sure that each of us was seeing and experiencing what we wanted on the tour. I felt like his tour was an inside look into the lives of the people, as opposed to just the tourist areas (which are fun too, of course). The villagers showed much respect for Dani, which gave me the reassurance that his tours are appreciated by (and helpful to) the locals - they're not an intrusion into their daily lives. I encourage you to book early, as this is a tour you won't soon forget. It's the prefect complement to any other sightseeing you'll do on your visit to Siem Reap."

Dani is a real gentleman happy to customise the tour to your liking and doesn't like to force anything upon anyone. If you say no that is as good as saying yes!! We got to try the ancient form of massage of cupping which definitely will be a memory that will stick with me for life.

We saw hammocks being made, experienced cupping, and got to talk to local people in ways we never expected.Dani is endearing, engaging and clearly well liked by local people. He's lived here on and off for over 20 years, and he knows everyone in town.Dani's tuk tuk driver is very careful and safe, social and always smiling. So lovely!If you are looking to see Cambodia beyond the temples, this is the tour for you....but book early - he is a one man show! My only caution - be prepared for the locals reactions to you. They can't/won't hold back comments about weight/size/appearance/etc. so if you can't handle that, tell Dani and he can bypass some of the less subtle judges (mass market incense maker family is a good one to skip)."

Dani kept it informal and somewhat personalized. He met me at my hotel the night before to talk about what I was looking for in the tour to make sure it was the right fit. He even dropped me off downtown after we met when my tuk tuk didn't show up. The tour itself was incredible. When he says come hungry, he means it. There was so much delicious food, and so many cool things to see and do. We met a kru khmer (traditional healer), which I had been trying to find on my own to no avail. The cupping was great and really helped to relieve some of the back pain I'd been having from the long flight over. I love getting out into the countryside and meeting some of the local people. The trip to the active pagoda was a fascinating juxtaposition to the temple tours. There's just something so surreal about seeing the monks' robes hanging up to dry after being washed. I could go on forever about all of the different things I saw and experienced on this trip, but I'll end by saying that this tour was well worth the money, and Dani was an excellent guide. I would definitely recommend it, and, if I end up back in Cambodia, I will likely book with him again."

Dani met with us the night before our excursion to discuss our preferences and interests so he could tailor the tour to our liking. He promptly picked us up the next morning at 7 am. We were whisked away by tuk-tuk to various locations- wet market, bakery, local home that makes tofu, school, blacksmith, pagoda, and local home. At each location, we were given ample time to take photos and ask questions. We even tried cupping therapy, which looks more painful than it actually is! Dani was a great guide who allowed us a sneak peak into the daily lives of every day Cambodian people. If you have seen enough temples, then take a ride to see the countryside! You won't regret it!!"

My daughter and I joined a tour with Four other lovely people. we went to the wet market, and although my eight year old didn't like the smells (take a perfumed hankie) she enjoyed the food we ate and seeing how Cambodian people shop. It was really busy for the new year and hectic. Dani took us to places and explained what we were seeing, and what we were eating. Don't have breakfast first! On our trip into the countryside we did so much. Lots of stops for water, and for food tasting. We saw insence being rolled rice noodles being made, cane sugar and lime drink tasting, rattan basket weaving, rice being puried into paste for the noodles, tamarind and rice pancakes, a water ceremony, cashew nut fruit tasting, cane sugar cooking and tasting , palm fruit tasting , cupping ( does not hurt) , local scarves, feeding the macque monkey (tugga is so placid and sits on your shoulder). If it was happening on the side of the road, Dani made sure we got to experience it. So many things and great value for money. Dani helped us change currency, found an atm, paid for many treats, and was the most helpful guide. He does not advertise with third party people to be able to cater the tour to suit you. Enquire and he will do what he can to make you happy. His drivers were very charming and amusing. Don't stress trying to organise other tours, just do it with Dani! My daughter said to mention that Dani was very nice and made her feel comfortable with his grasp of Cambodian and being able to translate in English."

As we walked through, Dan would explain what we were watching. Next we went to the villages in the Angkor area to either see local crafts being made or eat local specialties. Our favorite was getting cupped. His knowledge of the area is great and he wants to make sure you enjoy the tour. Getting to meet locals at their houses and see their everyday lives was a good break from temple touring. Highly recommend the tour to get an authentic experience of local Siem Reap and Cambodian culture, not the typical tourist experience. During the day you will be visiting many different places, so be prepared to hop in and out of the tuk-tuk. Each stop is to show you a different aspect of daily life. Great tour."

Dani was eager to answer all questions regarding local foods, and to have me try foods in various stalls - all of which were delicious. We then drove out through the countryside, making stops along the way to see community members that he knows making rice noodles, basket weaving, fishing, making candles, and made a stop at a local restaurant for fresh rice noodles with local vegetables (again, delicious!). Seeing the monkeys on the way back through town and stopping to give them a snack was the icing on the cake.Dani's tour is unlike other \"local village tours\" where one may feel as though they are imposing on the local community - this is very authentic, all people that he has known for many years, and who greet him as a friend. One of a kind. I highly recommend Dani's tours, truly an unforgettable experience in my trip to Cambodia!"

We saw so many great things, like the market (a tour all on its own!), and wonderful Cambodian people in their homes all through the day, doing whatever craft or skill that had been passed down to them. We saw an incense maker, basket weaver, bee keeper, charcoal makers, dogmeat eaters/cooks, noodle makers, voodoo candle rollers, palm sugar makers, and cuppers (i.e. people who perform the act of cupping?)..and also monkeys. It was fun riding along, and pulling over when Dani saw someone doing one of those aforementioned things. We also sampled so much food, I couldn't handle it all! Lots of sugar and fruit, you definitely won't go hungry. That being said, there were a few things I didn't enjoy so much, which is why I have decided on an average rating. When we were first riding along in the tuk tuk, at 7am on the way to the market, Dani was refreshing his memory on where we were from (I am from US, my husband from Wales), and I told him. Then he proceeded to tell us that he was very \"anti-America\" which really, I've been thinking about it the last few days, was quite rude. What was I supposed to say to that Dani? I don't care that you're anti-America, I care that you felt the need to tell me, within the first five minutes of the tour. It placed me in an awkward situation, I wasn't sure if I should defend my country or indulge you. My husband and I also don't like taking posey pictures, but Dani is all about it. We had to pose for multiple pictures throughout the day of us doing touristy things like eating noodles and sipping fruit juice, so Dani could post them to his Facebook. Finally, it felt awkward when we stopped in on the Cambodian families. We would stop in and stare and take pictures. It was just..strange. I felt bad for the people that were the stars of the tour, were only making a couple dollars a day, while Dani cleaned up with our $100USD and was insulting. I have no axe to grind, am not having a bad day at the office, just wanted to share my honest experience. Call me up when you're visiting the states Dani!"

It was really nice to get away from the temples for a day and to see the countryside, but there were a few odd things.Pros:Seeing the countryside in a tuk-tuk, amazing experiencetrying local food straight from the localsfinding countryside stands selling items where I could see them being madeDani found a local ice cream place which I was very happy aboutCons:Dani kept going on about how I was traveling solo and how I \"didn't want to share the experience with someone.\" I didn't think it was that odd and didn't want to explain to him that my father had passed and that was why I was by myself on the trip but finally had to to try to stop the issue arising again.It felt odd taking pictures of people in their homes and monks eating, felt like I was looking in a zoo at timesDani loves taking pictures which is fine but I'm not as much of a photographer so when he would pose me to take several pics of me to get the right one I got a little annoyed, but I think someone who loves photography would be in good hands.I am terrified of being bitten by a monkey and told Dani this, yet we stopped and he fed monkeys while some climbed onto me. I screamed and asked if we could go because I was really uncomfortable but he continued feeding and told me to calm down. Maybe my fear is irrational, but it is my fear and I had hoped he would take that into account.Here's the big one, several months before my tour Dani contacted me asking if I would be willing to move my trip to another day so another solo traveler wouldn't have to pay the single supplement. I was booked on a day that already had people but did not have problem as I was traveling solo myself. Fast forward to the day of and Dani met me at my hotel. I asked about the other traveler which he had no recollection of and said \"and I don't make mistakes.\" I pulled up the e-mail with the correspondence and he acknowledged that but said the girl never got back to him. We went on our way and at the end of the day I handed him payment and he said \"and a $20 charge for the single supplement.\" I was a bit stunned and he did apologize for the mix up but he still charged me. It wasn't a huge amount of money but it colored my experience and ended my trip on a sour note.Overall it was an interesting experience but I would not do it again."

We did the combo tour which gave us a taste of life in Cambodia. We visited a bakery just around the corner from our hotel. Baguettes fresh from the oven (hubby and daughter went back for more on another day). We went to a tofu making home and the wet markets where not only do you have your breakfast but wander through sampling traditional Khmer delights. Breakfast was superb! We then hit the road and travelled less than 15km outside Siem Reap to more rural areas where we visited a basket weaving family, a blacksmith family, a school and pagoda, palm sugar family, rice noodle family, rice paper roll family and a tumeric pancake type thing making lady. Sorry, I cannot remember the name of the dish. Rice paper rolls and the tumeric dish was lunch but you sample each food stop as you go along. We experience traditional Khmer massage called cupping. Does it work? Well k had had a headache for a few days and didn't after the cupping on my forehead so I'd definitely do it again. Be prepared for the marks to hang around up to a week. This is just a 'round up' of the stuff we did - as I go back throu photos there was so much more. Do yourself a favour and book today! We travelled as a family of Mum, Dad and two daughters 19 & 14. Daughter 1 is a vegetarian and this day was perfect as Dani is vegetarian as well. Option to have meat if you wish, we didn't. Since this tour daughter number 2 is vegetarian also - she did not like the wet market!!!

He is very attentive to the interests of your kids. The day starts off with a Cambodian breakfast like you have never had. He then walks you through the giant Khemer market on the other side of town and shows you plants, foods, flowers and plenty of other things you have never seen or understood. You taste bugs, plants and syrups of all variety. He explains where it comes from, how it is harvested and how it is used. Be warned: you will see animal, fish, plants, and flowers being extensively processed. You then drive out into the countryside and he shows you traditional bee keeping, palm sugar production, rolling of incense, traditional rice noodle production (unchanged in 1,000 years) traditional medicine, farm animals (if you want). You can ask all sorts of questions and he can either give you the answer or get it for you. He even takes you a place where you can feed the monkeys. Our 13 year old daughter said it was better than the temples. He is easy going and interesting. Everyone feels safe and the tour never gets too big. Dani is very knowledgeable and happy to share what he knows. Everyone feels engaged and there are appropriate bathroom stops along the way. It came out to $57/person for everything. Great for farmers, families and people wanting to see the countryside and understand traditional Cambodia life. You spend most of the day motoring in the countryside in a tuk-tuk with stops along the way. Tuk-tuk is included in the tour cost.

I tried many delicious dishes and snacks at the market along with a freshly squeezed sugarcane juice. After a good look around the market at all the weird and wonderful produce for sale, we travelled out to the villages. We visited numerous people in the villages, and every single one was up to something interesting....making rice noodles, weaving baskets, cooking down palm sugar, harvesting rice, making flutes, even a blacksmith. All of whom were extremely friendly and it was fun to be able to see what they were doing an interact with them. For lunch we visited two different places - one for some delicious noodles and one for a vietnamese pancake, both courses were fantastic. On the way back there was just enough time to stop off by a troop of wild monkeys and feed them some peanuts. The monkeys were climbing all over us, even sitting on our heads, it was brilliant!!Thank you Dani for a fabulous day, it was a real highlight of my trip and you are a wonderful guide.

I won't spoil it for anyone but I don't think you can go wrong with the combo tour. We have been to plenty of local markets in Asia but having someone with you to point things out and also to tell you what some things are makes a huge difference (assuming you are into that sort of thing of course). And we got to try a few local dishes that we just wouldn't have done had Dani not been there (ever fearful of getting a tummy bug). We had a lot of \"firsts\" that day, \"cupping\" included and yes the marks do disappear but it took about 3 days for my last ones to clear up.All in all, a fantastic day, we finished up about 2 so we still had an afternoon to chill out."

To say the very least, it lived up to the hype. Having traveled a lot over the years for work (TV/documentary/news production), I tend to find the usual tourist traps pretty cringe-worthy. Unfortunately, in Siem Reap the tourist traps have essentially swallowed the town; turning the old market area into a dystopian Disneyland of oblivious tourists and backpackers, and the scam artists who prey on them. After two days of crowded temple tours and desperate attempts at finding any shred of actual culture, we spent our last day in Siem Reap with Bees Unlimited. THANK GOD! It completely changed our experience of Siem Reap, and Cambodia in general.Danni tailors each tour to match the interests of the clients. He even came by our hotel the night before to run through the itinerary and make sure he hadn't left anything out that we might want to see. Our tour group was small (6 including us), which meant plenty of time for individual questions and requests; all of which were answered thoroughly. I won't go into too much detail about exactly what we saw, as every tour is unique. However, I will say that it was one of the most eventful tours I've ever taken. We explored markets, ate the local cuisine (which between us cost about $7 for the entire day, and was 100% vegetarian), met local craftsmen, and even got to experience \"cupping\". The photo opportunities are endless, and highly encouraged. It's also worth mentioning that this is the only tour we encountered that didn't feel like it was mercilessly exploiting the locals. Overall, this is a great tour with a great guide, at a very fair price. My only regret is that we didn't have time to do another one."

We started the tour at 7:15am with a tour of the local market. This was a wonderful way to start the day and Dani provided a yummy breakfast with some tremendous treats. My favourites were the fried rice balls with banana, silky tofu with ginger and coconut and deep fried sweet potatoes. We all left full!! The market it self was eye opening. Be warned- it is very muddy!! Dani had warned us off this the night before so we were aware to wear appropriate foot wear. Was a great party of GE trip. We then went on a Tuk Tuk journey through the countryside stopping off at wonderful and interesting locations to soak in Cambodian life. The trip included stops at- rice noodle making (from making the dough to eating them!), traditional medicines in the form of cupping, incense makers, sugar syrup makers and a visit into their home, a Buddhist Pagoda, a school, basket makers, a black smiths, feeding monkey's, and probably more that I am forgetting. The day was full of beautiful sights, people and food. Dani was a highlight of the trip and he did his upmost to make all of us happy and comfortable. He had every bit of the trip planned to perfection. I would not hesitate to recommend the trip to people with young families. My children ended the day so happy and content. They said it was better than the temples!!"

Dani's inherent knowledge of the delicacies on offer and the locals who make them best, did not disappoint. There was hot corn on the cob, banana fritters, fresh lemonade made on the spot, ginger tofu, fried noodle and yam pancake , amongst other specialties all awaiting the adventurous and curious. Certainly a breakfast to remember! The nature your in the Angkor forest was also unique, partly because of what we saw but also because of Dani's knowledge and passion for his \"pet\" passion ie insects! Things we'd usually pass by, in fact revealed fascinating creatures that only a seasoned nature-lover would know! Having spent many years living in Cambodia, what he now calls home, Dani is certainly qualified to provide the best experience beyond the usual temple tramping. A highly recommended 1/2 day tour. Just be aware of an additional 20USD on top of the quoted tour price that has now apparently become necessary for the temple pass for access to the forest - a new law."

Dani was great about responding to our emails quickly, and answering all of our questions prior to setting up the tour. We did the 'nature tour'. This started at 7am, with a hotel pickup. We went to the market for breakfast, which was an incredible experience. Dani knew exactly where to go, what stalls to visit, where to get things like sugar cane juice, ants, fried sweet potatoes, and Jackfruit. People all great him with a smile, and he was great about making sure we all ate enough and experienced enough. After that, we tuktuk'd to Angkor Wat for the nature tour. We saw many spiders, termites, ants, scorpion, and tarantula. After the walk Dani takes you to his favorite eating spot in AW. He was sure to save our coconuts from lunch to take to feed the monkey's! We had a fantastic day, and were so pleased we found Dani. It's a very unique experience. The walk can be long, so either manage your expectations, or talk with him about what sort of time frame you'd like to spend walking through the woods. He's a great guy."

Dani packs a full day of adventure and new experiences. The market was truly fascinating. Though I value local Cambodian guides, the fact that Dani is a native English speaker means he can describe things and answer questions with a level of detail that local guides often cannot - and there is a LOT to see and learn at the market! Tip: Bring some small Riels in case you feel inclined to reimburse locals in the countryside for allowing you to photograph them when you cannot buy what they are selling or making - I would have been more comfortable doing this instead of just taking photos, learning, and leaving. The best part was that Dani asked about our interests the night before and actually ended up taking us to a few truly personalized stops by tapping into his network here in Siem Reap. Don't be afraid to blab about your hobbies and pursuits - Dani is gifted at finding a way to craft a unique experience! As long-term travelers this tour was a bit over our budget but absolutely worth it."

However, you would be sorely missing out on an opportunity to meet gracious locals and learn what it's like to live in this part of the world if you only focused on temples. Looking back on my time in Siem Reap - I feel like I had a well rounded visit thanks to Dani rather than just dropping in for the Angkor Wat amusement park and leaving immediately after without any sense of what it means to live there. I can be a bit shy about exploring local markets and leaving the typical tourist path but you're in great hands with Dani, he'll put you at ease immediately."

It was great to have Danny's explanations on things we might never have tried on our own - indead all food turned out to be safe (no stomach problems). Then we hit the road by tuk tuk for rural Cambodia - including stop-overs at a local school, at a newly built temple, at rice-noodle making (and tasting), at local craftsmen and rice-wine makers. Danny was great with our children (8/11 years old) and patient in answering our questions. Being back at the hotel after 7 1/2 hours, we felt that the day had passed far too quickly - and we regretted that we did not have another day with Danny for his Tonle Sap excursions (which sound great too)."

Totally recommend everyone who comes to Siem Reap should do one of Dani's tours - yes all two million per year! It's a unique insight into some of the challenges facing not only indigenous eco-systems and the local environment, but also agriculture and horticulture. Unless bees are managed sustainably, crops will fail and people's livelihoods and subsistence will be lost.

While some of us had been to SR before to markets and out into the countryside we had not had such an opportunity to engage with so many local cottage industry's and local producers with someone who has a positive and long held relationship with them. Dani is so very sensitive to being culturally respectful and is also very able at identifying what you are enjoying. The day went from our delish market breakfast with more tasty treats and colourful sights, to visits to many countryside food and other product producers of many persuasions as well as 'treatments', a musical encounter with local men, visiting a regular small holding in the countryside and lunch out with Dani. Dani shared himself between our 2 tuk tuk's so that we could all have some of his time to learn more as we travelled along.Dani is a lovely, friendly, knowledgeable man who has developed a successful business by being himself and helping support locals by bringing people to them in a small scale way. Definitely a good way to know more than the amazing temples when you are visiting Siem Reap."

There can be no better way than to explore the Siem Reap village life than to spend a day with this gentleman who has lived there for the past 25 years. The benefit of a bilingual, vegetarian, Eco warrior as a tour guide cannot be underplayed. His love of the country that he had adopted as his home shines through a Tuk Tuk transported journey through markets, villages and peoples homes. The best tour I have ever had, it was like visiting a family friend and spending a day catching up. We saw the home manufacture of tofu, rice noodles, baskets and rice pancakes. Ate in markets with locals including deep fried tarantulas. The market tour is essentials for any one with any interest in food whatsoever. Simply the best day out to explore Cambodian life. We went as a family of 5 and to sum it up, Dani brought along a butterfly cocoon in a pot ( he collects and hatches these as a hobby) so our kids could see it turn into a butterfly and release it into the wild. Cannot recommend highly enough."

And then go check out the village with him, where he has such warm relationships with people. Cool to see tofu get made, get cupped, and just an idea for life in Cambodia.

But with Dani's help we had an amazing vegetarian breakfast, and then sampled different types of snacks and drinks along the way. Without Dani - not a chance I would have tried any of it. Off to a village (can't remember the name) but it was off the beaten track and JUST what we wanted to experience with someone who speaks Khmer. Dani has friends all over SRP and again we were stuffed with road-side snacks and delicious drinks. Great way to see inside the daily lives of the rural Khmer people who openly welcome you to show you around their homes. We had this amazing palm sugar - straight from the tree into the bowl where it's boiled down into a heavenly caramel-ish sauceNoodle making 101 - interesting fact that Cambodia has NO mass production. Everything here is made in country and by hand. Noodle-dough making is very very tedious and labour intensive. Everyone in the family plays their part in the process as this is their main source of income. These people have NOTHING seriously nothing but TONS of love, smiles and a willingness to allow us to come in and experience a snippet of their lives - TRULY blessed for this opportunity and the eye opening experiences it afford usYOU MUST try Dani - he needs to clone himself and get out with more people to show them the real SRP and the real Cambodia.

This was really interesting.The market is a whole different experience. My son and I have travelled quite a bit through Asia and so are aware of the sights and sounds but this was quite something!We had lunch in the market which was really nice and as we weaved our way around we had nibbles of local delicacies (I decided to be vegetarian for the day as I thought it would be safer!)After the market we got back on the Tuk tuk and he headed out of town to the countryside. Dani is a real local (he has been there for years and is married to a Cambodian). Everyone knows him and they have a great deal of affection for him which is really nice to see. The countryside is beautiful. Totally unspoilt. No electricity or clean running water despite being only a few kilometres out of town.The people are really lovely and we made lots of stops. We had traditionally cupping on our backs for a few dollars, we stopped by and saw an 87 year old lady still rolling incense sticks by hand and loving her job, a family making fresh noodles from scratch, the temple with the young monks, we stopped for fresh sugar cane juice, etc etc. Dani tailors trips around your individual needs. He comes and meets you before the trip and discusses what you would like to do and then tailors the trips around your needs.I am so glad we did this day trip as we would never seen what we saw if we hadn't. I really feel that we got a glimpse into real Cambodian life, not just the tourist bits.I highly recommend Dani and his tours!"

You will truly experience a completely different way of life close up and personal. Probably, something that is likely to disappear in 5 years. From the hustle and bustle of a real market, providing fresh produce (any of which you may sample - and some out of this world photos), to the beaming faces of elementary school kids learning to tell the time. We saw many different aspects of day to day life up close: making tofu, weaving mats, rolling incense sticks, monks having lunch, making rice noodles and much more.All those we visited were so welcoming, we entered their houses, watched them at work and took photos. Danni had a great rapport with them (clearly helps as he speaks their language).All in all a great excursion with a level of access you could only hope for - one of the best tours we have ever done.Well done Danni for supporting this community!Justina and Imamul"

I did some research before we chose which tour we would book in Cambodia, this tour had very good reviews and the itinerary was pretty much what we were after. When I visit different countries I like to experience the way the people live & survive there and this tour showed me exactly that!!! The whole day from start to finish was brilliant, we started off at the local market where we spent prob around an hour there, whilst we were there we had some breakfast at a local stall & also tried lots of the local delicacies. One of the main points I will make here is that Dani has good local knowledge so he can explain to you what exactly it is that you are trying and knows how much to pay for the items so you won't get ripped off, he can also liaise with the locals if needed. We also visited a small tofu operation where local tofu is made from start to finish.We then headed out to the villages where we spent a good few hours visiting different families looking at how they make their living and also most of the time trying out their produce/services. This goes from families making food, cooking food, making wine, rolling incense sticks, selling handmade items to local massage therapies plus lots more. My only advice here is with the \"cupping\" therapy, the sensation is quite weird and worth trying as it is cheap however me and my wife were left with 20 odd round marks on our back for the remainder of our holiday (2 weeks), which then made us wish we didn't have it done. (This isn't being negative just more informative so that you know).After lunch we visited the monkeys and fed them, we also visited the \"Killing fields\" monument in Siem Reap which is small so nice to just nip in and see quickly whilst on this tour rather than making a special trip.All in all me and my wife were over the moon with the tour and the service, Dani even arranged a small temple tour for us as we didn't want a full on tour guide tour so he arranged us a tuk tuk & driver and told the driver which temples we wanted to see. Obviously if you want the in's & outs of each temple you would need a full on tour but just to add at the bigger temples there are tour guides hanging around touting for work.On behalf of my wife and I we would like to thank Dani for this great tour, we recommend it for a great day out discovering the side of Cambodia you may not see if you don't take this tour!"

Besides Dani, there were only three passengers (booked me in with another couple, thanks!) so plenty of time for us to try everything. Pick up by tuk tuk at 7am, didn't return to town until 4pm. Meals are on your own tab but tasting is generally covered. Breakfast at the market is super cheap anyway. You don't know you've been paying tourist prices until you see how cheap street food and market food is for locals. Anyway, you just get to see a lot of stuff you simply wouldn't be able to see without the guidance of a knowledgeable local, it's fascinating and unique experience.there are some minor frustrations you may want to know about prior:-despite everything else he shows you being dirt cheap, lunch is inside the Angkor complex so inflated prices for standard food. The owners are friends of Dani's and I can understand he wants to look after them. But if you want to save 5 USD (which goes a long way here!) BYO baguette for lunch. Fairly underwhelming given all the great local food we'd been eating all morning. If you're monitoring this Dani, I had a great day but didn't tip b/c that money all went towards lunch instead.-be prepared to have your photo taken. often. If you are not cool with that probs mention that in the email when you first make booking, otherwise he sorta presumes you are cool with it and its sorta awkward bringing it up. I was actually surprised he is still so into all the things he sees but sometimes he can go a bit overboard trying to get a good photo. besides those minor annoyances though, it is truly an eye opener and I think if you are interested in seeing an authentic side to Siem Reap this is something to go for.

Dani explained to us many interesting things and facts, and always made sure to answer all our questions. Then, we had a wondeful ride by tuk tuk to several areas where we could see where the local cambodian people live and how they make a living from making homemade ingredients such as rice noodles, fresh palm sugar, etc, Overal it was a unique and unforgettable experience and I would love to join this tour again should I visit Siem Reap again in the future. Thank you Dani for everything! :)"

This tour gives you the opportunity to get out to the villages, see their way of life, taste their food, experience their way of life on a day to day basis. I cannot stop looking at my photos; from the market tour and all of the delicious food we sampled, seeing how rice noodles, candles, tobacco, fish traps, and mango leather are made. We packed so much in. How could i forget my cupping experience and feeding the monkeys?! Observing how the locals exist will put your life into perspective. I loved this day so much. Dani is a well travelled, knowledgable, honest man who enables you to have a real experience. My highlights, while so hard to choose - silken tofu with ginger, deep fried banana, being blessed by a lovely Cambodian woman, visiting the special meat BBQ (it's reality), the rice noodles process end to end, tasting and smelling palm sugar and ALL of the beautiful children and their happy faces. Dani - thank you..."

It started with Dani meeting my son and myself at our hotel on the evening prior to the tour. Dani spent an hour with us, discussing what we wanted from the tour, anything that we were prepared or not prepared to do and getting to know us as people and not customers. We had spent the previous two days visiting the many temples, and although they are awesome monuments, we were \"templed out\" and Dani's tour was everything that previous reviewers have captured in print. Dani and his tuk tuk driver collected us at 7am, and we joined up with the other tour members Caroline and Paul, a couple that were an ideal match and we thoroughly enjoyed their companionship throughout the day. We shared some treasured moments and experiences, that we would have missed without the knowledge of Dani. We visited a local fresh food market that was an experience in itself, as very few tourists venture there and try the vast tastes that it has to offer. We went out to the villages and met Cambodians at work and on two occasions were invited into their homes. We were privileged to view villagers making various things, including the whole noodle making process, which have remained the same for centuries. We watched as bee larvae was extracted from inside a tree by hand, and then sampled it. Over many years, Dani has built a mutual repor, respect, friendship and understanding with the villagers and is able to ensure that every tour has a unique experience. Dani returned us to our hotel after more than ten hours, and incredible value for the very low cost. If you intend to visit Siem Reap for a few days, please book a tour with Dani, you will not regret it."

It was a fantastic alternative to the temples and all in all a fantastic day out,made all the better as Dani is so passionate about Cambodia as a whole!I'm not the most forward or outgoing person but I found the whole day a true experience filled with so many random highlights and at no point did I feel uncomfortable or did I believe we were being intrusive in any way.I believe anyone joining Dani for a tour would have a great time, a personal highlight was seeing a man pull fresh honeycomb from inside a tree and then being treated to a little of the bee larvae! Along the way we stopped and visited so many people, all of whom welcomed us into their homes and even a few celebrations people were having!If I had friends staying in Siem Reap for only a day I'd advise them to spend it taking a Bees tour,as the memories and experiences will be second to none!"

The produce was remarkably fresh and the samples we had were delicious \u2013 particularly the noodle breakfast which I\u2019m still craving a couple of weeks later! The village tour later in the day gave us an opportunity see age old traditions including the rolling of incense, noodle making, hand carved flutes and the preparation of fresh spring rolls. Meeting these people was lovely and Dani\u2019s language skills and in-depth knowledge of Cambodian life was invaluable. All up I can\u2019t recommend this tour highly enough."

Family of four did the combo tour late March.This is a unique tour in that it really gets a good look at real daily life in the villages around siem reap without anything being staged or prepared prior to the tour.It is raw,shocking at times and most of all very eye opening and thought provoking as you see the kmer village life unfold before you.We all enjoyed this tour but I think i really liked it the best. I have been to many places and done quite a few tours in asia and around the world but this tour is special with its slow pace and unique approach and every tour is a little different as it depends on what you encounter while you are out there.some of the places our tour visited was the market which was intense in its rawness and intesnisty.we sampled lots of food and ate a tasty breakfast right there in the midst of everything.we did cupping,witnessed palm sugar being made.noodles/rice being made.visited a local house to see their modest living conditons-very eye opening.stopped for fresh cane juice -khmer style with an orange.we saw a place that serves dogmeat- definitley not for the faint of heart-make sure you visit the back area where it is prepared,and much much more.The tour guide is Dani and he is easy going,friendly if ot a little eccentric,speaks his mind and is full of information-just ask.The temples are a must see but you can only see so many temples,This tour is a definite must do as you will get to see and do things that you will remember forever,It is not a fast paced or adrenaline tour but a very unique,slow paced ,and thoughtful tour that will show you khmer life that is not seen by many,in my opinion a must do tour and well worth the cost.our tour lasted from 7am -3pm.transportation on a tuk-tukpick up and drop off at your hotel,guide will probably ask to meet with you night before to brief you on the activities and what to expect,If you want to do something -this is the time to let him know,lunch stop -near the temples-you pay your own-try the mango fruit drink-very tastybreakfast stop in market -you pay your own -cheap and well worth it,bathroom stops are scarce.do not forget your camera and enjoy!!"

The first stop was a local market. There was so much going on, lots of new fruits, local delicacies, and street food vendors. It is a place that would be difficult to manage on your own. Dani had us trying all sorts of things on the way to a breakfast of noodles, duck egg and veggies. My kids are not the most adventurous eaters, but they loved the breakfast and I was able to get my pickiest eater to try a few new fruits. Dani is a local and as you walk around the crowded market, he makes you feel like you fit right in. We bought a few things to nibble on on our way to the country side. We spent a couple of hours in a village watching a family make palm sugar, another family make noodles, and a lovely older lady make incense. The difference between this tours and others is that this is really part of everyday life. The families are not doing this for our benefit, there is no push to buy anything, this is really part of the daily life and we have the privilege to see what Cambodia is really like due to Dani's unique friendship with the local people in the area. Afterwards, we had a really delicious lunch at a food stall near the temple of the elephants. It was one of the best meals I had on my trip, and we then went on to feed the monkeys. Dani met us the evening before at our hotel to find out what I was interested in seeing, and he surpassed my expectations. My kids and I had a great day and my boys will remember it always."

We toured with our girls (9 and 11) and another family with boys (8 and 11) that was kind enough to agree to let us join their tour with Dani. It was wonderful to have other kids on the tour. We learned allot about making rice noodles, cupping, incense, buying elephant pants, feeding monkeys, sampling cane sugar, how bees live in a tree, how to cut lemon grass at the market...and more. It was a good value for the money and I certainly would recommend it to others with children."

We took the Combo Tour as Dani was concerned that there had not been much bee activity and I was glad we did. I enjoyed a well balanced day of seeing the local landscape, visiting the local wholesale market (slightly overwhelming), tasting Khmer foods, seeing local crafts being produced, crashing a wedding, and yes, tasting absolutely fresh Cambodian honey. Dani is very knowledgable and flexible. I highly recommend spending a day with Dani as a break to your temple visits. You will see an unseen side of Cambodia and get to interact with locals in a way that would not be possible with smaller groups. Plus, you will get some breathtaking views of the temples as you move about by tuk-tuk!"

Dani clearly has a relationship with many of the people you meet which creates a warm, interactive atmosphere.

In February we booked an exclusive day out on 26th March with Dani based on the excellent reviews and had been really looking forward to it.Dani met us the night before we were due to travel and after about 5 minutes let it slip that he'd booked a family of five at the same time and was that OK?Considering we'd booked an exclusive tour it wasn't really and Dani admitting it was his fault was happy to tell the family that he'd double booked and we could have him exclusively as originally agreed.Given how much we had been looking forward to the day and we naturally assumed the family would have also we felt very uncomfortable about this proposal.I suggested what I thought was a very reasonable compromise which was that we would pay half price as we were only getting Dani for half the time. That way all of us would have got the tour and we'd have been recompensed for sharing with a family of five.Dani insisted it 'wasn't about the money' but was totally inflexible with this suggestion insisting that we'd have to pay the full price even though we had lost the exclusivity that we'd expected. At that stage he was still prepared to tell the family of five that they couldn't come but frankly we felt very unhappy about that and in the end just told him to go and take the family as it was worth more to him.We felt completely conned and were hugely disappointed at his inflexibility as we had been so looking forward to it. He also dropped into the conversation that he had recently changed his terms so that if you wanted exclusivity it was an extra $10 each and he reserved the right to double book!That certainly wasn't on the website when we'd booked. He's obviously got so much demand he feels he can pick and choose his own rules. But for us we would not have enjoyed it either paying full price for a shared tour or having exclusivity and letting the family down.That may be acceptable behaviour in the USA but it certainly isn't acceptable to us!"

And most important, we met local people and learned from them, were blessed by their hospitality, and enjoyed the company and knowledge of the incomparably interesting Dani Jump! We actually spent a full day with him before we dove into the temple complex whirl, and I'm so glad that we did. I recommend the full day Discover Cambodia tour, but am sure that whatever you choose it will be fabulous!"

I am so glad we spent a day with Dani, and now feel lime I actually have a little context for understanding what is going on behind the scenes in this country, and what makes this such a beautiful and intense place."

His knowledge of Siem Reap and connections with the local people allowed us to watch many Cambodian people and families go about their daily business in their own backyard-- very fascinating. Tried some great food as well. Dani takes you around on tuk tuk to meet people around the countryside eg families making rice noodles from scratch and an 84 year old woman rolling incense. Just beautiful. Highly recommend for everyone interested in seeing the true Cambodia. An experience I will not soon forget."

Long story short, our overall tour experience with Dani was excellent. After going through the standard temple tours of Siem Reap, we were really looking for a different type of sightseeing and having Dani take us around Siem Reap definitely met this need. We toured the local market, spent time driving through the countryside on a tuk tuk visiting locals, and hit up Dani's wild honey farm (try the wild honey, the taste is amazing). We also got a brief history lesson of the city and got to try some local food as well. Dani is an excellent tour guide with lots of local knowledge of Siem Reap. If you are tired of temple tours and want a more local experience, we would recommend a tour with Dani to anyone visiting Siem Reap."

In my opinion, Dani's tour is what it would be like if you had a friend in Siem Reap who took you around to see everything, and could explain it to you. Same thing, but you give him a few bucks for his troubles. You'll probably only go to Siem Reap once, so see the temples for a day or two, then do this. Or split the team up if you have different interests (as we did). You won't be disappointed!"

We found Bees Unlimited (Your Temple Tour Alternative) through TripAdvisor, and we were impressed by the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I'm happy to report that the other reviewers are right. This is a GREAT experience, and I've already recommended Dani's tours to friends planning to visit Siem Reap.Dani met us at our hotel before going out for the day. I guess he wanted to talk to us to see what we could handle before planning the day's activities. Which is a good idea. If we were posh tourists who didn't want to get dirty, sticky, and sweaty, this might have been a bad day. Fortunately for us (and Dani), we were up for anything Dani had in mind.We started the day with a visit to a local market. Not the Old Market close to the tourist area, but another market. Super cheap, super crowded, noisy, dirty, and wonderful. We ate our way through the market, Dani paying for little snacks here and there for us to sample. He speaks Khmer and knows many of the vendors. Caution: this is not a clean and neat market. We squished through mud, got splattered with fish scales, frog blood, and other unknown substances, and nudged by motorcycles trying to drive through the crowds. The fried silkworms weren't really for me, but we enjoyed everything else. Don't miss the ginger tofu, a great way to start the day!Then we headed out to the villages. All I can say is, go for it. Whatever Dani has in mind, go and give it a try. We watched (and helped) with roadside cooking, we tried \"cupping\" (and I still have the hickeys on my back to prove it), we crashed a village wedding and congratulated the bride and groom, we rolled incense sticks, we sampled sugarcane juice...it was a blast. The only thing we couldn't handle was the \"special meat\" at roadside...we drove on past the \"special meat\" seller without stopping!No crowds, no tour buses, just real Cambodian life. Dani is a former Peace Corps volunteer who has lived in Cambodia for some 20 years and speaks the language. He really loves the country, and it shows. We love it too!VERY highly recommended!"

Dani has lived in Cambodia for many years, and obviously enjoys sharing all the different areas of Siem Reap with visitors. We loved visiting the Floating Village, the city market, and several of the outlying villages going further outside Siem Reap. Traveling by tuk tuk gave the tour even more of a local feel. It's a wonderful way to see a little more of the country, with someone who is very connected to it, and enjoys sharing many of the off the beaten track places of interest. We would certainly recommend Bees Unlimited as an opportunity to complement tours to the temples with your visit to Siem Reap."

Dani gives incredible perspective into Siem Reap life and shares his knowledge and relationships with incredible passion and joy. So many people have commented on what makes this special, but after doing the combo tour, the nature walk and the Siem Reap city tour, we have a few things to add:1) The tour is great for adults and kids.. Our 8 and 11-year old daughters loved the tours and were engaged the entire time. For kids, have them bring a camera. One of Dani's many talents is that of photographer and our kids were inspired to take their own amazing photos after seeing Dani in action2) Book early! If you are reading this review and not sure if you should do this tour, book now. Dani's tours book up early and there is a reason - they are terrific.3) The value is amazing. For the price and what Dani offers, we were amazed. Shocked he doesn't charge more.4) After traveling extensively, we have never met a tour leader who asks to meet in advance to discuss a tour. Take Dani up on his request to meet with you the night before your tour. Not only do you get to know Dani, but he can tweak the tour and answer any questions. Such a thoughtful and helpful idea!We spent two weeks in Siem Reap and started and ended our trip with Bees Unlimited Tours and did the temples in between. It was the perfect way to really appreciate all that Siem Reap has to offer. Even if you have less time, don't miss a tour with Dani. Check out his Facebook page under Bees Unlimited to see photos from each tour - his photography speaks for itself.Thank you Dani. We came to Siem Reap for the temples, but came away with a deeper appreciation of the people, thanks to you!"

My husband and I did the combo tour with Dani and it was above expectations. What we most liked about the tour is the many different things we did on this single day. We also liked the fact that is was a private tour. To visit the market with somebody who you can ask anything about the items they were selling and the Cambodian food culture, was great (I love local food and markets arround the world). The tofu and noodle making was also great to watch and you can try everything. We were very glad we did start on an empty stomach, as Dani advised us. Dani is very friendly and relaxed and you can tell him what you like to see and he will make the tour tailormade as you like it. We also did visit a monk school and Dani arranged (on the spot )a photoshoot with both young monks and a older monk, which was very proud and wanted my husband to take some pictures of him alone too. This was a very impressive experience as it was obviuous not many tourists did visit them yet. Dani thank you so much for this wonderful day and we hope to meet again."

This not just some scripted tour that a group of 30 do, it's just you and dani.

Dani\u2019s combo day tour is the perfect way to casually and comfortably get a glimpse into the real day to day life of the Cambodian people. There are certain stops that he makes regularly on his tours, but he is also very flexible and open to making stops to see things that may interest you (for me that was anything music-related), or spontaneously stopping at any point when you drive by something interesting, taking the opportunity to investigate. As others have noted, he meets you the evening before your tour to discuss what you will be seeing, but mostly to take the time to get to know you, and see if there is anything of particular interest to you, that he can try to fit into the tour. Its a very nice touch. He was easy to communicate with to set up the tour, always responding to emails promptly. He has developed nice relationships with all of the people that you stop to visit on the tour, and speaks Khmer fluently (through he\u2019ll tell you he\u2019s not fluent\u2026!). He\u2019s been living in Siem Reap for 20+ years, and has a family there so is immersed in the community and the way of life, the schools, etc. His wife is Cambodian. All in all, its a wonderful experience, and we felt very lucky to get such an up close and intimate view of the lovely Cambodian people as they go about their regular, daily lives\u2026preparing food, working in the local market, rolling incense, producing palm sugar, kids flying kites in the fields, people fishing in local rivers/streams, and so much more! check it out!

We watched tofu being made and rice noodles too, both the traditional way. It's like stepping back in time. I particularly liked the rice noodles! It was interesting to see an 84 year old lady rolling incense sticks and giving it a go ourselves. Apparently she has been doing this for approximately 70 years!

We were so glad we had booked a Combo tour with Dani to experience the real Cambodia.We left our hotel at 7am with empty stomachs as advised by Dani. First stop was Tofu making. Curdling enzyme was added to the boiled soy milk, which was then filtered and pressed into tofu. We tasted both the freshly pressed tofu and the deep fried version. Thumbs up from my eldest daughter who loves tofu.We stopped by a money changer to get some Cambodia Riel before hitting the local market.Unlike the huge but enclosed Old Market in Siem Reap, this market we visited was fairly open and airy. Although we've wondered around many wet markets in Asia, nothing beats having a 'local' like Dani to point out unique Cambodia snacks and customs to us. We had our taste of a typical Cambodia breakfast: fried fried rice noodles with eggs and chives dumpling, banana rice ball, bean curd with coconut and ginger syrup.... etc. The wet market tour was an eye opener for the kids.... especially live water snakes and live larva in bee hives!!!Next, we visited some villagers and experienced making of incense, palm sugar and rice noodles. Kids even had a chance to try out the stone mill at the noodle making place. It was really fun for them. My personal favorite is handmade rice noodles. I've never tasted such springy & delicious rice noodles.... It was truly a wonderful experience for us. Thank you, Dani!

We also had the opportunity to use a sickle to cut off the rice plants. Dani and the tuk tuk driver were extremely great with my boys, 4 and 7. We really loved the tour and highly recommend it to all going with children to Siem Reap. You will never regret it. Book early to avoid disappointment."

Seeing that Siem Reap did not have too much to offer other than temples that we were interested in, we contacted Dani. First of all, we were impressed that Dani met with us at our hotel lobby the day before the tour, to get to know us and ask what our interests were. He adds a personal touch to all his tours, and he is so accommodating. On the day, Dani came to pick us up, right on time, with the mode of transportation du jour: the tuk tuk. We went first to the local market - somewhere we would have never been able to enter without a guide. Dani speaks Khmer well, and we toured around the market sampling tid bits of food. The warm ginger tofu we had was amazing, even better than the one we had on the streets of Hoi An, Vietnam. We also had some fruits that we had never seen before. I won't give away everything, but the marketplace was very eye opening. We went into the country side and visited families and local businesses along the way. The cane juice with orange was sooooooo good. We experienced cupping, eating fresh noodles... lots of eating, touching, smelling.... If you are done visiting temples and want to get into the countryside, Dani is your man. Honestly, all the things we did, we never would have been able to do by ourselves. This is not our average tour, definitely not for the squeamish! If you want to get a real Cambodian experience, this is it."

After much searching on google I found a few blogs talking about the Bees Unlimited discover Cambodia tour so decided to book on!This by far was the best tour I did whilst in Cambodia (I did all the temples/floating villages museums etc)This tour primarily focuses on food but also gives you a real insight into how the Cambodian people live and work!We started at the tofu factory which isn't actually a factory but more a family home where they make tofu! It was so interesting to see and hear how it's done and there was a lot of tasting to be done.We then moved into the market where we had a traditional Cambodian breakfast of noodles, veg and egg along with some other tasty delights Dani (the guide) picked out for us!After the market we headed to the village, this was my favourite part, interacting with the families, watching how the rice noodles and sugar products are made but also getting the opportunity to try making your own incense sticks and try out the ancient holistic method of cupping (I still have the marks but it's not painful, actually very relaxing) all along the way we were constantly encouraged to try the different foods, the surroundings are beautiful and as the tuk tuk drives along the local children are waving to us and calling out to Dani, but I think one of the top things about this tour is that I did not see a single other tourist during the whole experience, which, after fighting through 1000s of people at Angkor Wat the day before made it absolute bliss!Dani, your guide is from the USA but moved over to Cambodia I want to say 20years ago and is extremely knowledgable and obviously there isn't the language barrier, even the tuk tuk driver he always uses is very friendly, has excellent English and lovely to talk to.I would recommend this tour to anybody who goes to Cambodia who wants to actually discover the real Cambodia!"

We spent our first day with the temples--an amazing and unforgettable experience. We knew we had to change it up for Day 2 to keep the boys interested and excited about our Cambodian holiday. After reading the stellar reviews, I scheduled Dani for the day tour visiting the market and outlying villages. It was awesome and such a great experience for anyone of all ages including kids. We visited at least 5 different homes each catering to different specialities in Cambodia--tofu, cane sugar, rice noodles, incense, cupping, etc. It was enlightening to see typical families and their living environments. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming and tasting much of their goods was either free or less than $1. An A+ tour that all should schedule. Dani was accommodating for our kids and genuinely interested in what we wanted to do and what the kids wanted/needed. We also did the \"cupping\" for $1. Crazy cool experience!"

And Dani also shows you loads of foods that you would be too worried to try or wouldnt even notice. We had a great time on both our tours and fully recommend bees unlimited."

The Bees Unlimited combo tour with Dani blew all of them away. It was our best day in Siem Reap and probably the best day of our whole holiday!Dani met us in our hotel the night before our trip to explain a few bits and pieces which was a nice touch. The trip started bright and early at 7am which was good as the temperature was slightly lower. We started in the city but away from the touristy areas. We visited a family making tofu and then moved on to the market which was really fun and interesting. Being American Dani obviously spoke perfect English. What was more impressive was the fact that he can also speak Khmer! When we walked around the market Dani seemed to know practically everyone and was laughing and joking with the locals. We tried various bits of fruit and local food, all of it delicious!After the market we headed out of town, east of Angkor. We shared a tuk Tuk with Dani throughout the day and it was really interesting chatting to him about his past and local life. The tours vary slightly on a daily basis. Even in the countryside Dani seems to know everyone! This means that he drops by different people on different days. He also keeps an eye out for anything interesting on route and is very happy to pull the Tuk Tuk over and investigate. This is where his knowledge of Khmer is invaluable.On our trip we saw lots of stuff. Some highlights include trying our hand at incense rolling, having a traditional Khmer massage (cupping), stopping at a noodle maker, and popping in to see a rice farmer and his family. We also tried lots more delicious food and drink and met some really friendly and funny locals!On our return to town we stopped at a couple of the Angkor temples for more food and photos. Dani never once rushed us and kept coming up with suggestions for places we might want to stop. He even took us to an interesting Buddhist Pagoda just north of our hotel that we did not know was there. We can not recommend Dani and his tours highly enough. He is a great guy and the combo tour was simply brilliant. We will be sure to look him up again if we return to Siem Reap. If he continues to operate in the same vein then his tours are sure to continue to climb the TripAdvisor leaderboard!!Thanks again Dani. Kate and Chris"

I am so glad that we booked this tour, it was an amazing day with a fantastic guide. Dani meet up with us a couple of nights before had to chat about what we would be interested in seeing, and as per his word he was there to pick us at 7.30am sharp, and then the adventure begins. Our visit clashed with the three days of festive celebrations in Siam Reap, and Dani was a bit disappointed that he wasn\u2019t able to show us some of the things he wanted to, but we were amazed with what we did see, certainly not things we see in our everyday lives.We started off by going to the local market (and I mean where the locals shop), it was amazing and a buzz with people, different produce (meats, fish, fruits, veges, flowers, herbs, breads and much more) and variety of smells (some nice, some not so nice), Dani informed us it wasn\u2019t as busy as it usually was. We got to try some different foods one that surprised me was the ginger tofu ( I was a bit unsure of this especially when I think Tofu) but it was good, it was fresh tofu, with a ginger sauce and coconut cream over it..yummy, Mr 15 even like it but fussy hubby and Mr 8 didn\u2019t try\u2026their loss... also tried snake fruit for the first time. After the tour of the markets we then headed out to the countryside to the villages, and Dani would stop at different places along the way depending on what he saw and if there was anything that caught our eye we just had to tell them to stop. We meet and saw the loveliest people who were always walking around with smiles on their faces, going about their daily lives, not minding at all that these strange faces were watching them go about their daily activities. They may not have spoken English (Dani was translating) but laughter is always the most common communication, and there was plenty of laughter. We had the most refreshing fresh sugar can juice, sampled banana in sticky rice, the best ever Cambodian rice noodles which the kids had multiple samplings of (and we watched the process they had to go through to do it \u2013 wow what a process, we saw it when they started and later in the day finally saw them cooking it - and then getting to taste it) we saw how they made items to use in everyday life (not using any fancy machines all by hand) e.g. fishing traps, mats, we rolled incense with the loveliest old lady (so glad I got to meet her), we tried cupping, had turns at grinding rice, turmeric and water, saw stuffed frogs being cooked on a roadside stall, having a steering competition with a water buffalo, we also stopped at a Pagoda and had photos taken with some of the young monks the list goes on. My boys were amazed seeing what kids their own age do to keep themselves amused \u2026.that is right boys no tv, ipads or ipods\u2026my boys loved every moment about the trip\u2026 Mr 15 said \u201cwow this is fantastic it has been eye opening and amazing\u201d\u2026. Mr 8 said \u201cat least my incense stick wasn\u2019t bendy like yours mum\u2026 and I loved those noodles they were the best\u201d (sorry people he loves his food)... What I have listed is just a part of what we saw and did.Lunch was at #38 at Ankor Thom, the food was so nice, the young girls that served us were so lovely. As Dani stated to us each tour is different, even he sees different things each day, so no tour is the same. One thing I can assure you, if you book one of Dani\u2019s tours, you will walk away with the most wonderful memories. Thanks again Dani and we will see you again when we return to Siam Reap at some stage."

The morsels of food we tried throughout the market soon had us feeling full, however we both managed to find room for our lunch at #38 Angkor Thom. If you're interested in getting a good overview of both modern and traditional Cambodian culture away from the usual temple crowds, then I'd highly recommend getting in touch with Dani and tailoring a tour to your interest.

I am not one to take cultural tours (except maybe in Scotland), and I booked with Dani without realizing that this is NOT a temple-and-food tour. Best travel mistake I have ever made. Just to be clear, though, the tour does pass by some temples, so you get a tiny taste of what tomorrow's temple tour will be.Reading the other reviews, you will note some variability in the reported experiences. That is because Dani's tour goes through real Cambodian life, instead of arranged or staged \"experiences.\" Will there always be springrolls or freshly made rice noodles? Sure, but popped rice or bee larvae, maybe not. (and that is just as well with the larvae)Try all the food, and be adventurous - here is your opportunity to eat weaver ants in the market or grilled frog at a roadside stand, along with lovely fried bananas and several delightful rice concoctions. Dani has a wonderful passion for his adopted home and is very knowledgeable, curious and truthful. He is always paying attention to the people and the natural world, and cares deeply about both. See a thousand year old man tying reeds or bamboo together, and Dani will engage him in conversation to find out what he is making.

However, we me up the night before our tour for a pre-tour run through, and from then on I knew we were in good hands. Even though many of the locals speak quite good English, it is nice to not have to 'filter' the accent from every conversation.Dani was punctual in picking us up, and even brought his son along to help keep our young boys entertained during the day. Then the most amazing adventure began...off to the local tofu factory, which is an eye opener in itself. Onto the local markets for breakfast, where I could have spent all day. Sadly my husband does not share that enthusiasm, and some parts of the markets are not for the squeamish, but we still managed a delicious local noodle dish for breakfast, ginger tofu, bee larvae, drinks, icecream and many other tasty samples along the way ( I had told Dani on the previous evening that food was my passion and he sure did not disappoint!!!) After this we headed off to the countryside where the boys and I all planted rice with some locals, watched rice noodles being made manually the way it probably has been for 100's of years. We hand-rolled incense, had lunch with the locals and returned for fresh rice noodles (I think my son had 3 or 4 serves!). All along the way, Dani gave us an insight into everything he knew about the homes and villages we were passing through, and made sure if we ever wanted or needed to stop for something, we only had to say the word. We did/saw/experienced more than what I can write here - you just have to get out there and try it for yourself.This day was absolutely everything I was looking for in a 'local village' tour and totally recommend Dani to anyone looking to do something different while in Siem Reap. If you have any special interests, just let him know and I am confident that he would tailor the perfect package for you too."

Our trip to Siem Reap started out with a few days of temples and while beautiful, didn't give us an overwhelming sense that we were experiencing the real Cambodia. Prior to arriving in Siem Reap, I had arranged a tour with Dani based on the myriad overwhelming reviews that I had read.Dani was super cordial and prompt prior to our arrival and met us at our guesthouse the night before our tour. He ran us through a basic idea of what to expect and made sure that everything we'd be doing was well within our comfort zone. I immediately felt at ease and couldn't wait until the next morning.A prompt 7am pickup via tuk-tuk and we were off. A quick stop at a tofu factory which was in a residential area was intriguing and a great way to set the tone for the trip. From there we went to a market that seemed to be selling everything under the sun, we were there early enough that it was bustling and quite a sight to behold. Dani being fluent in Khmer was a huge benefit and got me the answers to any questions I had. The nature of the tour is largely \"if you see something you want to try, say so and you'll try it\", so the market was a whirlwind of tastes, smells and new experiences.A warm tapioca pudding with coconut cream was breakfast, from there it was deep fried bananas, pickled bamboo shoots, roasted chestnuts, longan berries, durian sticky rice, sugarcane juice and some tremendous stir-fried, vegetarian noodles for a second breakfast. I'm sure I'm missing something, but mind you this was in the span of maybe an hour. This aspect was worth the price of admission alone. You could spend months in Cambodia and not get an experience this authentic. Oh! We also got a tray of Durian to eat en route to our next destination.What was great about Dani's attitude was he wanted you to try things if you were remotely curious about them, I was interested in trying Durian and he made sure to shop around and get the best deal for the money. Never pushy, but he certainly understands that you may never get a chance to try these things again, so anything you want to try is fair game and his fluency makes sure the language barrier isn't an issue.Durian in hand we were on our way, a super scenic drive into the countryside filled with great conversation and Durian. A sidenote, Durian gets a bad rap and it isn't without good reason, it smells awful and tastes only slightly better. Granted, its an acquired taste, but I managed to eat a few good sized pieces of it and I'm still here. You absolutely have to try it (and Dani loves it, so if you can't finish some -- I'm sure he can help with that). Our first stop was at a palm sugar operation based outside of a house. A mother and daughter were running a stunningly simple, but highly efficient operation and were eager for us to sample the goods. A perfect morsel of a caramelized, almost maple sugar confection made just off the roadside. It doesn't get better than that.After that we stopped to chat with a family that does some basket weaving, then a brief stop for some sugarcane juice (this stuff was amazingly good), onto a rice noodle factory where we got to try some fresh noodles right out of the press, stopped at a rice paddy to see some transplanting in action, and then we met a family that was in full production of a rice & meat dish for an upcoming event.One major highlight was stopping at a roadside stand that had these tasty rice gluten balls with a small bit of palm sugar in the middle and were topped with coconut. About as simple as it gets, but delicious through and through. From there we stopped at a pagoda where we were able to catch the monks eating lunch and we stopped at a wonderful lunch stand to wrap up the day.I really can't say enough good things about Dani and his tour. I went in not exactly sure what to expect and left feeling like I had made a friend and learned more about the country and culture than I thought possible in the span of a day. Go into the tour with an open mind and you'll leave feeling like you should have paid triple what you did. There is so much value to the way Dani presents an area that he truly loves, you won't regret spending the day on this tour. Dani is a class act and we'll definitely be going on an adventure with him when we're back in Siem Reap!"

We travelled to Siem Reap from Thailand for a few days, although initially the plan was to spend a couple of days touring the temples, and the rest relaxing, after a long but very informative first day, we were literally templed out. They are gorgeous but once you've seen the main ones.... which is easily possible in one day, you've seen them all. After searching trip advisor, we came across Bees Unlimited, and made contact with Dani Jump. I wont repeat what others have said already about him, only he's an incredible guy, and will show you things I guarantee you wouldn't see without him. The fact he speaks Khmer makes the full experience all the more fun, and the locals he takes you to see are genuinely delighted to see you. We will definitely return to Siem Reap and Dani will be the highlight of the itinerary. The full experience is a mind explosion of culture and lots of eating ;) you will not regret this combo tour."

Dani Jump is from Michigan, raised in India and worked as a beekeeper in Siem Reap. As such, he has formed many contacts within the local community, which led to an enriching experience that won't disappoint. We started our day traveling via tuk tuk to the upper market. Talk about sensory overload. All sorts of local produce, including custard apples, winged beans, cassava, mangosteens, lotus stems and dragon fruit. Come to the tour on an empty stomach. We breakfasted on fried rice noodles, duck egg (sunny side up) and some sort of fried pastry with greens inside similar to what you would find at a Chinese dim sum. All for about 25 cents. We then tried various treats including boiled cassava, custard apple, fried sweet potato, and something called pig ear which was not pig at all but a fried pastry with green onions. Go figure. One favorite was a rice pastry filled with banana. As this was the rainy season, protein sources were abundant. Lots of fish, crabs, meat (including rats and crickets) and poultry were for sale everywhere. A great plus was that we saw only one other tourist and so this was obviously where the locals shop. After we left the market, we visited a site where tofu was handmade. Won't get any better in any store anywhere! Then we headed to the more rural areas and visited an ailing woman who makes incense for the local community. She taught us how to roll incense; not nearly a easy as it looked but my 6 year old did a better job of it than I. We also visited a local weaver who spun thread with a homemade wheel, had our backs \"cupped\" to remove toxins from our bodies, and visited a family business that made rice noodles for the local eateries. Best noodles ever! We were also taken to a place where they serve cooked dog meat; somewhat disturbing but it's apparently a delicacy here. And no, we didn't try any. Overall a tour off the beaten track and a not-to-be-missed experience."

We toured the market trying anything and everything that looked wild or different from our western palate. Most helpful was Danny's translation and description of everything we tried and the methods that we're being used to create everything. We visited local Buddhist temples, families and handicraft workshops and even rolled our own incense.

Off in a tuk tuk around several villages seeing fresh tofu and rice noodles being made, sampling rice wine, cane syrup,& cane fudge & lots of othe things at the homes of the people who made them. So different to a normal tourist trail, meeting local children and seeing people in their own homes who were obviously relaxed with Dani.

Once we read the reviews about Dani we knew we had to go on one of his tours and it didn't disappoint. We are a family of four with a 9 and 11 year old. Dani met us the evening before the tour at our hotel, to get to know what we were most interested in. Very professional. We started early visiting tofu-making workshop and then on to the local markets. They were awesome. Lively and bustling and full of different sights and smells and then finished off with a local noodle breakfast. So fresh. We then headed to the villages surrounding the temples, tried handmade noodles (very tasty), tried cupping (interesting experience) and tried everything we came across by the side of the road, date fruit, cashew fruit, sugar palm juice...It was just after Khmer New Year and some festivities brewing in a local temple which we had the opportunity to see. It was a very long and very worthwhile day.This trip is all by tuk-tuk. The few days before we had driven around in an air-conditioned car, fearful it would be too hot in a tuk-tuk, but it was really fun and the breeze keeps you cool. And Dani's choice of tuk-tuk driver was spot on. A very friendly and kind man who helped out and was very compassionate and found bags of ice from locals after my son leant against the exhaust pipe of the tuk-tuk and burnt his leg (only minor).Dani is a native English speaker which made a huge difference for our children who could understand everything he said. They were very relaxed the whole day and engaged by what next he would show us. He tailors the day to suit you. Highly recommended. Thank you Dani. We would definitely take his tour again if we ever go back."

Away from all the tourists and temples it doesn't matter if you are alone, a couple or a family, since there is surely something to see and eat for everyone.If you walk onto the market with him, and some random Cambodian guy comes up to you and says \"Great Choice\", then you have probably picked the right tour (happened to us). But the best thing about the tour is that Dani will have as much fun as you have when showing you around. His enthusiasm will really get to you and will make the hours fly by in no time.Dani is probably one of the most interesting people we have met along our three weeks in Cambodia. Born in America, raised in India and in Cambodia for 20+ years, he really knows his way around. The fact that he speaks Khmer (Cambodian) will bring you closer to the real Cambodian culture and living than you might get in any other way. Dani knows so much about Cambodia that you can ask him about anything you want, and he will most likely have an answer for you. And he will take his time with you to really sit down with people and just enjoy the day.We had a great day. And whatever Dani charges you for his tours, it is most likely worth more! Dani will give back to the community in so many ways (which you will see when running around with him), so your money is well spent on him anyway.Thank you Dani for an awesome day!!!P.S.: A word of warning for all those people who like to have breakfast. Don't have any when you go to the market with Dani!! There is enough to eat there for any taste and you need to try that!"

After meeting with Dani the night before our tour and having a chat about things we like to do and see while traveling to new cities; it was evident in the next day\u2019s activities that he took to heart what we had said. Our adventure for the day focused on what makes the village tick and for almost all the stops that was food! After all there is no better way to understand a culture than thru what they eat. From the lively market in the city to various stops around the countryside villages we had the chance to see how specific foods were made and of course sample the fresh tasty delights. But what really made the day special was how Dani and the families he has created relationships with, some he has known for many years while others just a short time, interacted and invited us to see them work and the outpouring of their very generous spirit. And with life in the countryside changing day to day and season to season while we were looking to see if families were making a specific treat we came across another making something else. So you really can say now two tours will ever be the same. So if a great food tour and a fun adventure is what are you look for, this is a perfect tour for you!"

He tailored my visit to exactly what I wanted to see; in this case I was able to witness a sustainable bee harvest not far from the city. Dani's associates built homemade smokers and allowed me to watch as they approached a wild rafter hive to remove a section of the comb for pollen and honey, leaving a place for the bees to return. I was perfectly safe the whole time (nobody got stung) and really enjoyed the experience. Even when I thought I might have to cancel because a driver I had lined up fell through, Dani organized a tuk-tuk last minute and saved the day.

Most of the other reviews speak about how amazing the tour is, and I am going to agree with them. We tried a large number of things we would never have had the opportunity to try, and interacted with many people whom we would never have had the opportunity to interact. I would add this to the itinerary every single time. It is relatively comfortable, easy to get along, a great price, and good fun.

The combo tour offered by Bees Unlimited provides a taste (literally) of the local market as well as meeting a number of people outside town in their daily activities: making tofu; rice noodles; rolling incense sticks; and beekeeping. We also got to ride water buffalo and see a crocodile farm. Touring with Dani is like visiting an old friend and having him take you around to his favorite places. There is no fixed itinerary or agenda- he gets your input on your interests (and those of your kids) and charges off accordingly.

But more than that, I got a real life glimpse at how the Khmer people truly live in the villages outside of Siem Reap. This was, I must say, not only worth the price of the tour, it was priceless. We visited many cottage businesses where I met locals who were weaving mats, making (the most delicious) noodles, boiling palm sugar (also yummy), making tofu, rolling incense sticks, and (of course) keeping bees. I observed traditional ikat and mat weaving techniques and tried grinding rice with a wooden grinder...If you want to fall in love with the Khmer culture and meet some absolutely lovely families who are just going about their daily lives, by all means take this tour.

If you want to discover what daily Iife is like for the real, rural people of Cambodia, schedule a day tour with Dani. Easy to book online and great value for money for the service and content of the personalised tour that Dani makes for you. He met us at our hotel the night before the tour to find out exactly what we would like to see & do from his long list of activities. We went by tuk tuk, visited the local market & then went into the local villages to meet the people as they carried out their daily lives. It was absolutely fascinating as we were allowed to try out many of the foods, take part in the food and craft production processes, look around their homesteads, interact with them and we even rode a water buffalo! He also showed us wild rafter bee hives, tarantulas & pitcher plants which was also very interesting. Dani was a wealth of information, and very respectful of both the needs of the local people & those of his clients. Highly recommend this tour for any age group, we did it with three boys aged from 10-12 and they were kept engaged & interested, as were were, for the entire day. Thanks very much!"

Am fr\u00fchen Morgen ging es zuerst auf den Markt in Siem Reap. Hier zeigte uns Dani was man so alles ohne bedenken essen kann. Danach ging es in den Dschungel. Am Anfang hatten wir nicht viel gesehen, aber Dani zeigte uns auf welchen Baum oder Strauch wir sehen sollen um Tiere oder interessante Insekten zu sehen. Er erkl\u00e4rte sehr ausf\u00fchrlich \u00fcber den Dschungel. 2 Wochen vor unserer Reise hatten wir mit Dani Mailverkehr wo alles vereinbart wurde. P\u00fcnktlich wurden wir von Ihm und seinem Tuk Tuk samt Fahrer vom Hotel abgeholt.Wir k\u00f6nnen Euch auf jeden Fall Ihn empfehlenDani takes a lot of time and effort to show a nature, animals, insects, or simply the people of Cambodia and explain. In the early morning it first went on the market in Siem Reap. Here we showed Dani what you can so without eating in mind. Then we went into the jungle. In the beginning we had not seen much, but Dani showed us which tree or shrub shall we see to see animals and interesting insects. He explained in great detail about the jungle.2 weeks prior to our trip we had with Dani mail traffic where everything has been agreed. Time we were picked up by him and his tuk tuk and driver from the hotel.We can definitely recommend him to you"

Dani's enthusiasm for bees and his respect for both the native bees and the harvesters of native bees in Cambodia translated to a fascinating trip through the forests and villages of Siem Reap Province. He is passionate about teaching sustainability to people who have been harvesting honey from the forest for generations. If you have never seen giant rafter bees or tiny stingless bees, this is a tour you shouldn't miss. There is so much to see and learn from Bees Unlimted that I plan to go again the next time I am in Siem Reap."

We started by going to a home where they make tofu and then onto the busy market ( not the tourist ones) and get to taste food that you wouldn't otherwise dare try. Dani has lived in Siem Reap for 20 years and speaks the language.For us the real adventure began when we went out into the countryside. We went into people's homes where we saw incense sticks being made by an 84 year old woman ( who had never been to Siem Reap!), noodles being made, palm sugar being made, we had a go at grinding rice flour, tasting the fruit of the cashew nut tree, experienced the ancient art of cupping (google it!), the chance to ride a buffalo and lots more besides. We came back overloaded with images and memories of a wonderful land.The trip is planned around....well nothing. Just what the villagers happen to be doing that day. Such beautiful people, inside and out. They have so little compared to us in the West, but seem so much happier. Ooh - forgot to mention the dog restaurant. We decided to pass on that taste sensation!I have a feeling that before very long, it's going to be difficult to book this trip, so do it now before the secret is a secret no longer!"

Our tour started with the local market visit and continued with the life of Cambodians in the villages. We ended our tour around 16.30 with a visit to a budist temple after lunch.Don't expect to have a fixed itenary. It is just the daily life of people. What we liked mostly is you can shape your tour by just asking Dani to stop during tuk tuk driving. Thanks to Dani and the driver, they were really supportive and patient. Dani just stopped whereever we asked. Since Dani is able to speak the local language and known by some of the local villagers, we found ourselves in their daily life for a moment instead of just watching them. It was a totally impressing feeling, a new world. One recommendation, if possible take some candies, small toys or some gifts with you for the kids in the villages. Could be much better instead of giving money to them to protect their purity. As a conclusion, temple tour definitely worth to have in Siem Reap. Don't miss that amazing history, unbelievable sculptures and carvings. But if you have time, don't leave Siem Reap without having this real life tour with Dani..."

We loved the tour of the market and really felt like locals trying many new and delicious foods. And if you are a Caeliac like me it's food paradise! Dani was a wonderful tour guide and a real gentleman. He looked after us and really educated us. He was also really flexible and we felt a real sense of freedom while on the tour. We really enjoyed his company.It's hard to explain the genuineness of the experience but hanging out with a local family waiting for our palm sugar rice ball treats (absolutely delicious - I want one now!) we really felt like we had really visited Cambodia.Dani's love of the people really came through and we fell in love too!

On our way back we had nice lunch at #38 in north gate of Angkor Thom, which also allows us a glance at the antient city without an Angkor pass.The lemon grass fried vege is very nice, even their plain rice is delicious and also not expensive at all.

So you definitely get more than what you expect.My advice is: save some time for a day or two with Dani when you are there, worth it in any aspect."

Before our trip, we were chatting via e-mail to make sure the trip would work despite food allergies and having an active youngster with us. The market trip alone made the day worthwhile. He knew the key stalls that he wanted to share with us, as a Khmer-speaker he could confirm that the items were free of particular allergens, and even more, he is a regular market visitor who the vendors enjoy. We could never have enjoyed so many tastes had we gone on our own.Then the rest of the day was going out to the small villages. This is well described by the other reviewers. The pace, variety, and his knowledge of the people and their products made for an enjoyable and educational outing.If you want to leave the traditional tour circuit and learn a bit about contemporary Cambodian life, talk to Dani."

After spending a week photographing the temples, the tour with Dani was a great way to relax and see how Cambodians go about their everyday lives. Unfortunately, it wasn't the bee season so I couldn't do a rafter bee tour with Dani, however, his tour to the villages was a great alternative. Dani's tour starts off at the local market where you get to see and smell all the different foodstuffs that regular Cambodians buy for their daily meals. You get to have a delicious breakfast at the market before driving to the village. Rather than repeating the same thing as in the other reviews, I will just say that this is a tour that should not be missed. A true vacation is one where you get to see how the locals live and go about their daily lives and you will get this with Dani's tour. I highly any of Dani's tours and if you're there during the dry season, you should not miss the chance to see the rafter bees with Dani."

If you want to see what is beyond the temples and the tourist crowds, then Dani Jump is your man. We booked this tour after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. Dani was very prompt at returning emails and was from the outset willing to personalise the tour to make it our experience. From the beginning, you can tell Dani is incredibly enthusiastic about showing people around this beautiful part of the world. Dani was keen to catch up with us the night before the tour, just to touch bases with us and to get a feel for what we might like to see. We were picked up on time at our hotel and whisked away by tuk tuk to the local food markets. Dani, being a regular and fluent in Khmer, was able to ask for samples of all of the amazing foods on offer, lots of sweet foods, fruits, vegetables, bamboo shoots and wonderfully sweet sugar palm juice which came in a little plastic bag with ice and a straw sticking out the end. We stocked up on some foods for the trip and off we headed into the countryside. We visited so many people, a family making palm sugar, some women grinding rice to make noodles, a wonderful elderly woman making inscense, a little girl weaving palm leaves and so much more. At each stop, we met incredibly gracious people with big welcoming hearts and smiles to match. These were not necessarily all planned out activites. Dani and his driver have this ability to see something on the side of the road, stop and just walk up to peoples homes to see what they are doing. We even pulled up on the side of the road so our two boys could have a go at planting rice in a field, where they were once again welcomed with open arms.On the way back, we stopped at a restaurant near the terrace of the elephants in Angkor Thom complex where we had a delicious lunch and a chat and a laugh about our adventures for the day. My children 11 and 10 really enjoyed the tour. The only place that I ushered them out of quickly was the dog restaurant. That was quite confronting, but this is part of life in Cambodia. If you do this tour with kids, I'd ask Dani not to stop there. All in all, Dani gave us the unique opportunity to see a part Cambodia that I would never have seen otherwise. Cannot recommend highly enough."

If you want a super authentic experience of siem reap with someone who has lived there for 20 years, speaks khymer but native language is english then Dani is worth every penny! First of all you feel like your on a tour with a friend because he takes you where you rarely see another tourist. From shop to stands, everyone knows Dani and with that comes the privelege of free samples, meeting locals and their families, and coolest of all eating at delicious local spots and watching cambodians doing all sorts of handiwork and crafts from incense making to wooden fish traps and noodle making. Not to mention going through endless breathtaking views and nature walks with orchids and carniverous plants and you can ride a water buffalo and taste local honey or find a beehive since he's one of the experts on honey in the area.Aside from the truly magical experience of seeing what I did, what I loved was that Dani customises on the fly depending on what we were interested in and it felt so spontaneous and stressfree! And Dani himself is a whole other story. He is one of the most interesting people having lived in India, south america, and africa doing service projects he knows so much about the world and the earth and nature and he sees and points out the beauty in plants and animals that others wouldn't notice.By far one of the most memorable days of my life!"

They understand that you come from a different culture and will be patient of small cultural faux pas. They were receptive to our visit to their homes & our questions while Dani acted as our interpreter and answered our questions about the Cambodia way of life. We also visited the village temple while the monks were having their meals and tread through the forest to see where the bee rafter was placed.

We called Dani and he said he would meet us at our hotel that evening to talk about what we might want to see. Dani offers much more than just beekeeping tours and we were game for whatever he proposed. The next morning Dani and his tuk tuk driver took us to see the real Cambodia and it is something we will never forget. First stop - Cambodian market place. It was an assault on the senses for sure. All kinds of unusual fruits, meats, insects, and well pretty much anything you can think of - ants, duck embryos in eggs, snakes. We had a delicious noodle breakfast. We took hundreds of photos. We likely would have never ventured through it alone, but Dani made us feel comfortable and understand what they were selling.Next up Dani took us to see some bee hives at his partner's house. The kids were of course fascinated by us and followed us around...so cute. We had a drink and then moved on to visit a number of peoples' houses and how they make their income. We stopped at one house where they make rice noodles, another who makes incense, charcoal, baskets, palm candies, and more. The people were so friendly and nice and we were able to pick up some truly unique gifts and take the picture of the person who made them. It is amazing how hard they work yet how joyful they seem to be.We then went on a short hike in the jungle to see some more beehives and plants. Saw a couple of varieties of pitcher plant and Dani tried to tease a tarantula out of its hole, but no luck. Then we hopped back on the tuk tuk and went for lunch near one of the temples. The food was great and we ended up going back to that spot during our temple visits.Throughout the tour Dani acted as our interpreter and answered our many questions about Cambodia, its history, and the people today. He is knowledgeable, interesting, and goodhearted. He also gave us advice on what we should and shouldn't see in the area.

He is very well known by the locals which makes it easy to ask whatever questions you have and get to see all the interesting things they eat. We tried several things we'd never eat again but that's what made it fun. Definitely a must see. We then went through a local village because we really wanted to see how the country people live. Dani guided us from house to house where we would observe what each family did as their family trade. Some were weaving baskets of palm leaves, others preparing food (including dog meat), and others preparing for rice harvest among many other things. The Cambodian people were so nice and amazingly welcoming of us into their homes. It was a day we'll never forget and are so greatful of Dani's great adventurous guidance into their world for a day.

I'm solo traveling in Cambodia and had a few days of unplanned Siem Reap. After two days of multi-hour temple treks, I was ready to try something else, that didn't involve shopping, Pub Street, or sitting in my hotel room. Remember those youngster days of finding yourself in a world of creatures you couldn't wait to touch and show your friends? Caterpillars, millipedes, giant spiders (yes spiders!)... Well, Dani is a little boy at heart, ready to find that next illusive butterfly or giant caterpillar - and he loves showing other people Cambodia's beautiful creatures. I was blessed with a private tour with Dani, and so I got all the attention :) He and his tuk tuk driver picked me up from my guesthouse at 7am and from there, we headed to the wholesale market for some eats, a walk-through \"tasting tour\" and some great photography opportunities. After a yummy noodle breakfast, I tried red ants (what?! Yes, tasty indeed!) and a few other delicious fried treats before we headed back to our driver, full bellies and ready to trek. If you have hiking shoes, you can wear them, but I prefer sport sandals (Chacos or similar). I say this because there are quite a few ants and termites on the floor and you don't want them burrowing in your shoe, not to mention it can get a little muddy in areas if it's been raining, so a strapped sandal is the preferred option, and is what Dani wears as well. I encountered a couple of mosquitoes, but it wasn't that bad. Bug repellent is advised. We went to the temple grounds, although you don't need a temple pass to do this, so don't worry if you've already exhausted your pass. Our driver dropped us off in a random location which Dani knows very well, and off we went on the trail into the forest. After a while, we happened upon a fisherman, and we were both excited at the opportunity to photograph him casting a net into the lake with a beautiful scenic backdrop (it's out here where you get these kinds of photos!) The fisherman had a prosthetic leg, and through Dani's fluent conversation in Khmer, we found out that he was a victim of a landmine. He graciously allowed us to watch his fishing process and take a few photos. We then headed further into the forest, where the creature fun began. Now, I don't suffer from arachnophobia, but that doesn't mean I like spiders in my general vicinity, much less crawling on my arm. Almost right away, we were greeted by a giant wood spider (Nephila maculata). They aren't the largest spiders in the world, but from what I've read, they build some of the biggest webs. Dani showed me how harmless and actually awkward they are when not in the safety of their web, and after very little coaxing, this thing was walking across my arm, no big deal! We did this again with stick bugs, a whip scorpion (doesn't sting or bite) other spiders and caterpillars. We DID find a tarantula, but we couldn't coax him out of his hole.We then had lunch with our tuk tuk driver and watched the mischievous monkeys while chatting over our findings that day and other things that Dani's come in contact with. He's an all around great conversationalist, patient, and willing to wait until you've gotten the perfect picture of whatever we've stopped for. I could tell that he was really enjoying the tour as much as I was, and got excited at everything I was excited about. I think the highlight for him was when we spotted the Whip Scorpion - that thing was really cool, and totally harmless.It was really, the highlight of my Siem Reap experience, and if you're looking for that additional day activity that will show you \"real Cambodia,\" THIS. IS. IT. Get on with yo wild self!"

I was able to get within 2 metres of a working bee colony, and thanks to the skill of the locals with me, I was never in any danger of getting stung. To be this close to a wonder of nature, and watch these men harvest the honey was a sight I shall not forget. All thanks to Dani and his teaching the locals on sustainable harvesting of the combs. And he made it a wonderful day. Apart from the visit to the bees, his knowledge of the countryside, the markets and nature in general is astounding. Thanks Dani for a great day."

            "review": "Our best day in Cambodia!!!. Our family of 4 (with two young kids 3 and 5yrs) did a day trip with Dani and it was the highlight of our one week in Siem Reap/Cambodia. Although the temple visits are great from a culture and history perspective, I cannot recommend highly enough for anyone to spend a day with Dani to give you a real experience of current life in Cambodia. Everything about the tour (planning to actual tour and afterwards) went really well and I credit Dani for his experience in handling all sorts of travellers! Key points1) There was prompt response to emails before hand and organizing times/dates and high level itinerary 2) After we landed in Siem Reap, we met the night the tour before to discuss what and when to see - Dani was very flexible and wanted to make sure that the schedule suited the kids (side benefit: we found the best mango shakes in Siem Reap!)2) Our visit to the markets & villages were great - we live in the Philippines and travel to local villages in the islands frequently, however what is different in Cambodia is that the villages are more diverse in creating produce/products - and hence with Dani, you can get a true sample of village life. The highlights were - trip to the local market (Dani pointed out so many things that most travellers will look at but not understand), traditional rice noodle and palm sugar making, dropping into a large extended family making wedding treats, trip to the private crocodile farm.Throughout the trip, we could sense that Dani had a heart for the locals and for promoting sustainable and simple livelihoods. . I had originally thought the tour would take less than a full day (because our kids would get bored) - but the tour was so varied and Dani was so patient that we (especially the kids) lasted the whole day!"

Get away from the tour groups and experience the real Cambodia by taking a tour with Dani, an American who grew up in India, spent the past 20 years in Cambodia, and speaks Khmer. He has a great perspective on Cambodia from a Western point of view, knows what interests us and has a deep understanding of nature, Cambodia and the East. Dani tailored the tour by meeting with us the day before to review our interests. You can arrange a schedule geared more towards nature, culture, or both depending on your likes. As beekeepers we wanted to see beekeeping practices in Cambodia but were also interested in Cambodian daily life. We started with a tour of the local market where Dani pointed out all manner of plants and animals consumed by the locals. This in itself makes the tour worthwhile, very interesting. The beekeeping village was about an hour by tuk-tuk but we made a number of stops along the way to see things like how noodles are made without electricity, palm sugar production, and how dog meat is prepared (totally optional but worth a visit to shock our western standards). Upon arrival at the beekeeping village we met with a family or rafter beekeepers and sampled the local honey. We were able to visit a few rafter colonies which are very different from our Langstroth hives.If you have time after visiting the temples, a tour with Dani should top your list. The experience was one of our highlights in Cambodia. Strongly recommended."

He has lived here for 15 years and speak fluent Khmer so this means that he knows many of the people that you meet on this trip very well. First stop was the market (I've seen a lot of markets in the past 7 months I thought), but at 7am and with Dani's help it was another new experience- snakes and frogs and all kinds of strange things. I got to ask the names of all those things I had never figured out before. Mangosteens are delicious by the way. Then along the way in the tuk tuk we stopped for various things- to see a colony of bees high up in a tree, to see how noodles are made, to see dog meat being prepared (optional and slightly stomach turning). My boy Jacob loved riding on the back of a water buffalo belonging to a local family. My main interest is in bees so we went out to search for a rafter colony kept by locals. Unfortunately we only saw one small one. WHen we met the family sadly they told us that 2 colonies had been stolen that day and the son had felt they needed to cut down their remaining one in the area and bring it in, honey, lavae and all, for fear that they would lose it all too. So, if you like to see real life this is for you. Of course the long journey on a bumpy road is a small price to pay I say (we did 7am to 2pm tour). Best to take long trousers as may be walking through the bush."

If you want to see the \"real\" northwest Cambodia, spend the day with Dani, and ask to see all the families he knows along the road to his rafter-beekeeping operation outside Siem Reap.I hooked up with Dani because of the bees, but his tour--starting at the local wholesale market in the morning--will expose you to life as it is actually lived by the people in rural Cambodia. We stopped half a dozen times to visit rural families making their livings in ancient ways--making palm sugar, rice noodles, incense sticks, dyed palm leaves, sugar-cane juice. These are not tourist stops, they're just folks Dani has gotten to know over the years of working with the rafter beekeepers in the countryside.My wife and I are just back from four days in Siem Reap. One day we devoted to the temples, and they are amazing. But for me, the day spent talking with Dani and getting his close-to-the-people look at the countryside was a highlight of the trip."

Sure they see the most popular sites but they miss the some of the beauty and much of the subtlety that this amazing place has to offer. That is where a good guide comes in and Dani Jump is among the best. Dani is westerner but long term resident of Siem Reap and he has his feet firmly planted in both worlds. He will make all arrangements for your tour, show you things and places most mere tourists don't get to see, but he will also tailor things if there is something special you want to see. Yes, Dani is a nature and bee expert but his tours encompass history, culture and so much more. I learned more in just a few concentrated hours with Dani than I had in several days of stumbling around on my own. Highly recommended."

He was recommended by an acquaintance we met in Vietnam, but our tour was far better than we could have ever expected. Dani met us at our hotel at 7am (it gets really hot in the middle of the day here so everyone starts early) and we headed to the market. Since we are foodies, we wanted to try everything- and Dani worked with what we wanted to see and do. We tried a bunch of different fruits and had breakfast in the market, then headed out into the country beyond Angkor. We stopped to watch rice noodles being made, machetes being forged, and tried sugar palm nectar and sugar. We stopped by a place where rice wine is made, and had some fresh sugar cane juice. We went out on a nature hike and saw tarantulas, as well as sustainable honey harvesting and many cool carnivorous plants we don't see in the US. On the way back through, we got to taste the noodles we watched earlier, and headed back through Angkor Thom at stall #38 for lunch.Overall, Dani was incredibly well-verse in all things Cambodian. He knows many of the locals after having worked in their villages as a volunteer, and he introduced us to the 'real' Cambodia. Everyone we met was incredibly kind and welcoming, and really made us feel like we were friends like Dani instead of tourists. We hesitated at the thought of barging in on people's lives, but that is not how Dani operates at all. We went only where we were welcomed, and met many lovely and interesting people. Do not leave Cambodia without doing a tour with Dani, we would have had an entirely different experience without him! Plan another day between temple-ing if you can- it's worth it!"

He picked our party of three up promptly at 7.00 am in a tuk-tuk, and drove us to a site just East of Angkor Wat - a site that no tourists could get to on their own - and took us on an amazing walk through rich forest, ending up at a restaurant near Angkor Thom where he was greeted as a long-lost friend and we all ate excellent food at a good price. Dani is an absolute mine of information, so there was never a dull moment on the walk - and thanks to Jason's keen eyes, we were able to spot tarantula nests and, with a little bit of prodding with a stick, the tarantulas themselves. A unique experience - not to be missed."

Our aim was more than achieved.Dani Jump, proved to be a wonderful tour guide along with his friendly driver, Mr Chan. This was the sort of tour we wanted. Wearing shorts, loose shirt, jandals and getting dirty. Away from the hoards of tourists wandering around the temples of Siem Reap and instead, being amongst the wet lands and rice fields. These two tours proved to be the high light of our trip to Siem Reap.Dani's tour introduced us to bees of Asia. We were thrilled with Dani's knowledge and humbled to find a man passionate about nature and so keen to make a difference in the way honey is collected in Cambodia. His team of bee keepers collect the honey head and not the whole comb. They are able to harvest more honey this way and keep a colony alive. Their dream would be to introduce this method to more areas in Cambodia. It would be so nice if their dream could be fulfilled. In this tour we saw not only bees but magnificent butterflies. We wandered through a wetland and found orchids and lovely pitcher plants. We saw where the bee keeper puts his rafters and we were so excited by this we decided to return in March when the honey harvest is in progress.We enjoyed the first trip so much with Dani that we decided to venture on a second with his driver, Mr Chan. This was called the Temple tour. This tour allowed the flexibility of going about Angkor without the hustle and bustle of other tours. The driver would see aspects of nature and stop for us to fossik about. It was great. Tarantula hunting, more bee spotting and the grand daddy of all, finding a snake and photographing it. If you want to get away from tourists and see more of Cambodia then do book Bee's Unlimited for a tour. Dani, is such a personable host. He is a conservationist and needs all the support he can muster. You can help by going with him then spreading the word. Enjoy Cambodia and its nature."

I researched the company some more and ended up booking a morning out with Dani to check out the rafter beekeeping community he works with in Siem Reap. Let me say, before I even got to Cambodia, Dani was amazingly friendly and helpful- he is a wealth of information and was so accomodating when planning my half day tour, it was lovely to feel like the tour was being planned around my needs and interests. On the way out to the beekeeping community Dani works with we stopped several times to check out different bee species (as Im a hobbiest beekeeper this was a real treat for me) along the way, a highlight was being able to check out a beehive inside a coconut tree, I was able to put my camera inside and take some amazing photographs! Even though it wasnt honey season Dani took me on a tour of the forest and showed me where the rafters were placed for the giant honey bees to settle on when they migrated back next honey season. He also pointed out various orchids, pitcher plants and other points of interest. Dani was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable it was a really fun tour and a great way to see the beautiful Cambodian countryside and interact with the friendly locals. Im already planning my next trip back to Cambodia, this time during the honey season so I can take a tour again with Dani and see the honeybees in full swing!"

His knowledge of the area and his easy going style make a perfect combination. What he doesn't know, he checks with his local honey hunter partner who's lived in the area all his life.I enjoyed getting \"lost\" in the community forest while being shown something amazing at every turn. We were able to see empty rafters where the community can sustainable manage local bees for their precious jungle honey. If you're around during bee/honey season, then you're in for a real treat as the honey harvested is 100% pure and sustainably harvested to maintain the bee population.More sights to enjoy were the numerous varieties of pitcher plants, carnivorous plants, wild orchids, and some amazing berries that the local just picked fresh and handed to us to eat. Take a sip from sterile, unopened pitcher plants, which make a great emergency supply of liquid nourishment in case of a survival situation. Bear Grylls, take note!I loved every moment of this nature walk, and could have stayed out longer discovering more of Cambodia's amazing natural beauty."
