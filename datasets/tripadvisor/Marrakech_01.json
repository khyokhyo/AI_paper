Booked the day before, w/ excellent communication. Tour guide and driver were excellent, although we made several stops we never felt rushed. Left a lot of options open for us to decide on our own to customize tour for us, even bargained with the locals for souvenirs. Rode camels through desert in the sunset, the sunrise in the morning was unreal. Food was amazing, A+++"

Booking was easy and communication was great with Mohammed before our excursion. Would highly recommend a day outside of the city learning more about the Berber culture. We drove out of the city and stopped first to have breakfast with a Berber family then a little further went for a short camel ride. Then drive through the mountains and rode miles up to the waterfall then to an amazing lunch with a Berber family. Hiked back down then drove to the other side of the mountain for some ATV's then home. Long day, but so much fun and learned a lot. Thanks Abdul and Morocco Active Adventures for an awesome day!"

            "review": "Unforgettable Tour through Morocco. We did a private tour for two. We booked the three days trip starting in Marrakech over Ait Ben Haddou, Ouarzazate, Tinghir and Erfoud to Merzouga. The way back we took the route a bit more south passing amongst others Tazzarine, Nkob and Zagora. The booking we did from Germany was really easy and Mohamed from the agency answered all our questions we had upfront really quickly. Starting from the very first moment when our guide and driver Abdul picked us up we felt really safe and comfortable at all times. Abdul gave us interesting information and answered all of our many questions with pleasure. No matter where we stopped, we enjoyed great food and clean sanitary facilities.To stay at the hotel Xaluca was another highlight on this perfect trip which could only be topped by the camel riding and the night in the dessert camp with the friendly staff. We enjoyed a great night with a group of about 12 other tourists from different countries including african live music. Visiting a nomadic family in a mountains cave gave us an impression of local living conditions what we found interesting. By the way, Abdul is a very good driver which we find important given the winding roads in Morocco. We are more than happy with our decision to have booked the trip at Morocco Active Adventures and can recommend it without hesitation. Special thanks to Abdul who made this trip unforgettable to us."

He plan things ahead and therefore managed to change our original plan based on the weather conditions. Listen to us carefully and answer all kind of questions. Unlike most tour guide, he does not force us to buy anything or treat us differently based on our \"performance\". Instead, he observed our real interests and introduced some really nice local shops when we need. Always on time and detail oriented (he always make sure there is enough toilet paper before he show me the way to the toilet...)The sand tour was bravo! Staffs at camp site were very friendly and versatile. After the dinner, there was a bonfire party, with great live music from staff, incl original Africa songs with drones and pop music with guitar. The dromedary guide Hamd's strong will to learn Mandarin was impressive. Hamu, the cute chef, turned out to be a great company. We enjoyed the food, the Dromedary dance he taught us, and company under the beautiful star ceiling. Nice trip and highly recommended!"

We were picked up by Abdul (who was fantastic for the whole trip) in a nice people carrier and started our journey into the mountains. We stopped for Moroccan tea at the first house after this we carried on into the mountains stopping at the best places for pictures - the views are fantastic across the atlas and Abdul certainly knew the best places for pictures and was happy to take them for us. We had a short came ride which was Ok for the novelty factor, after this we carried on driving and eventually arrived at our next destination. We visited a small town in the mountains where we rode mules to a waterfall, hiked for a while and reached a Berber house where lunch had been prepared. We enjoyed the lovey tajine food and fresh bread basically on a roof top looking out over the mountain! The sights alone walking through the town/village were so interesting, to see how people live was great. We hiked back down the mountain after lunch and drove on to the lake area where we did quad biking for an hour. This was really good fun but perhaps could have been a little faster! Abdul was happy to chat to us and answer our questions but also let us snooze and just chill - it was a long day but so worth it! Great service and they even followed up with a whatsapp message the next day to ask if we enjoyed ourselves, where we thought they could improve and also if we needed any more advice or help for our stay. A truly great company - book with them you won't find a better trip that encompasses so many different activities and sights!"

We contacted Morocco Active Adventures via WhatsApp which made it easy to book our 4day trip, since they answered to my questions very quick. Our guide was great and amazing driver. We got lots of knowledge, passion about their Berber culture and fun and laughter too. It was a pleasure to visit Youssef's Berber family, enjoy lots of lovely music, try great food, see fantastic scenery, spend a great night in the Sahara desert under stars with Berber music.The food was very good as well.

The problem was that the reviews in many agencies looked to good to be true. We were sure that the reviews are fake but we were wrong. I cannot say how are the other agencies but the trip we did was perfect. Our guide was Said (excellent!!!) and he really overachieved our expectations. Definitely worth it!"

After good, clear & timely communication per email upfront, we (group of 6 friends) were picked up early at our hotel in a comfortable airco-ed car (although maybe a little small for 6 adults) by our nice guide Abdul and then drove towards the Atlas. Fisrt stop was at a tradiotional Berber family house where we were showed around and tasted some bread and the lady of the house explained about the tea, then back on track towards a beautiful small valley for a short camel ride. Never did it before but what an experience :-) Then a longer drive through the beautiful & scenic Atlas and Ourika valley. The next stop was for a combined hike & mule ride (most of us liked it, myself I found the mules quite wobbly) to some waterfalls and a very tasty lunchbreak at a Berber family home. Then another spectaculair drive to the stop where we drove ourselves on a quad/buggy through the sand/dry river banks. After a long but very nice day Abdul brought us back at our hotel. He really could tell us a lot about moroccon,arabic & berber life and took good care for us by getting us new water bottles every now and then. Would definitely recommend it!"

He met us at our hotel in Marrakesh and started explaining the entire trip to us while we were driving in a very comfortable SUV. He gave us history of every stop and he made stops that were absolutely unexpected (a baby camel and family!). Besides Youssef being fantastic, the trip overall was amazing. We spent time in the Atlas mountains on our way from Marrakesh to Fes. The stops were incredible including rock climbing in a gorge, a visit to a family friend living in a cave and a Nomadic family living in the desert. The ATV riding through the dunes of the desert was unreal and we could not have asked for a more fun trip."

We were travelling with myself, my wife, and our 2 children (10 and 13). We did the one day excursion into the Atlas Mountains, and it was a fabulous experience. We loved the 2 home visits and particularly enjoyed the mule ride up to the waterfalls. The trip was very professional and exceptionally well organized. The guide was thorough, knowledgeable, and even willing to tolerate us pestering him about his personal life as we tried to get some concept of what day today life is like in Morocco."

The route by the ocean is simply stunning. Our guide Abdul is superb and with his knowledge of the history and culture, he makes the tour a real pleasure. The accommodations arranged by Abdul were great and so were the places we stopped for lunches/dinners. This is the second time we did a long tour with Abdul as our guide, as in his company the tour is much more fun and informative. Can\u2019t wait to come back again for another long tour to cover the north of Morocco."

Our four days was jam packed with adventures from horse riding, camel riding (seriously uncomfortable), camping in the desert, sand boarding, quad biking and going to see the waterfall. Said was very informative, funny and kind. One of the highlights of our trips was visiting a Berber cave, it was truly eye opening getting to meet some beautiful people and see how they live. Our adventure was amazing, but it did require a lot of time driving, so if you want to spend less time in the car, just mention it to them when you are planning your trip and they will accommodate you."

Mohamed was very responsive and answered all my questions thoroughly before I made the decision to book the private tour. Tour: The tour was great and highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Morocco. We did the 3 day/2 night Sahara tour. We visited a bunch of places in between and spent one night in the desert. Hassan was friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, and very accommodating. Not only was he a great tour guide he is an amazing driver. Driving through the mountainous regions and tight roads was not easy and I came away very impressed and felt safe. Hassan was always on time and made sure we would be able to enjoy all the tours at a relaxing and enjoyable pace. Highly recommend the company to anyone on the fence about taking a private tour. For those who are considering group tours (the ones you can typically get at your riad or from guys on the street) be aware that those do not come with English speaking tour guides. You just have a driver bringing you from one destination to the next and a group of other tourists trying to figure out what things are."

We took a private tour for 2 and we opted for a pre planned itinerary which started with breakfast in a Berber home, followed by a camel ride, a drive through the Atlas mountains, a hike to the waterfalls, a lunch in a Berber house, a donkey ride and then quad biking in the desert. It was a long day so be prepared, but it was so much fun! Our guides were very friendly and knowledgeable about Morocco and kept us very comfortable with bottled water and stops along the way. This definitely enhanced our trip to Morocco and I'd highly recommend it."

The activities here were amazing. They were the most beautiful memories I have ever had. We also appreciated the customised service. We wanted to add Ouzoud waterfalls, which was on the opposite direction from our tour. But the company managed to do it for us. Our driver Saied and guide Addi were very thoughtful, flexible and friendly. Me and my boyfriend we had really comfortable time with them. We were worrying because many tours would bring you to shopping place, but this never happened to us. Every second we felt it was for us and we enjoyed it a lot. Lastly I want to see, Morocco was super nice. Especially with various activities. We did rock climbing, horse riding, camel riding, sand boarding, star gazing, quads biking... They were all super fun, I really wish could have a trip back there just do all those activities again. It was my first time doing quads biking on the Sahara dunes, we could drive to some areas you can never get access to with camel or walking. Saw those dunes without any foot prints. Wonderful!The accommodations were really good as well. First night we stay in a four star hotel on the way to the desert. It was kinda on the top of a hill. So we could oversee the town. The most amazing was the swimming pool, it had a cold water pool, a hot water pool, and while sitting in the swimming pool you can actually enjoy the amazing view. And the camp in the desert was the best camp I have ever seen. Very awesome and comfy. We moved our bed outside and slept under the stars. It was the first time we saw those stars that clear and the view was breathtaking."

He told us all about the camels and pointed out many things of interest along our trek. He then took us to a Berber village where we dismounted and enjoyed mint tea and pancakes. We then headed back riding against the back drop of the setting sun. This was such a lovely experience to share with my daughter"

The booking process is a bit strange in that you pay a deposit into a pay pal account but do not be concerned about this. Its a very well run business.Pros:- knowledgeable and friendly tour guides- well planned day with lots of activities (perfect if you are short on time)- everything is taken care of and tour price is all you payCons:- none We cannot wait to come back and do another tour."

We could make changes in our itinerary for a \"let's go look at that\" kind of thing. Or he never once tried to hurry us even though we were trying to stay on schedule. Then when we were too tired and just wanted to go back to our hotel, like everything else, \"No problem!\" We slept out in the Zagora desert after riding to camp on Camels (pretty painful for the fellas). The camp was awesome but it was pretty warm (what do you expect) and the driving is very long. However you're going to leave feeling like you \"know\" Morocco when you're done.

Booking and paying a relatively small deposit of 50 euros was simple through paypal. We then got picked up from our hotel at 9am by two really nice guys. The driver was a brilliant driver that drove at decent speeds but we always felt safe which is an achievement by itself as anyone has seen morrocan drivers would know. He told us that we of we wanted to stop for anything like drinks, toilet or just to take a picture he would (and did). The tour guide was really knowledge, interesting and funny. He told us stories of morrocan traditions, as well about the sights. For lunch we stopped in a lovely riad with a pool to cook off as the temp was about 43\u00b0 at this point. Be aware that as they will stop whenever you ask the journey can increase. We didn't ask to stop that much as they advised enough places with spectacular views and sights. So with minimal stops that we requested it took us about 9hours to get to the desert. At the desert we were greated by the men from the camp that led us on camels for about an hour to a camp in the desert( while the sunset) . At the camp we were given green tea and time to shower, settle in etc. The showers were also pretty decent. The tents have a light, beds, a charging point carpets so you could say this was closer to glamping than camping \u263a. Dinner was beautiful, tagines, salad and melon. It was quite windy when we were there so they didn't light a fire but they sang songs, played drums, guitar and danced. They kept us well entertained all night. Switching the lights off in camp gave a spectacular view to the unreal Blackett of stars where we lay until about 1.30. The heat in the tent was incredibly hot and many chose to sleep outside which seemed safe enough As it was very windy on our night we slept in the tent but it was very hot and nosy from the wind. We didn't sleep much but please don't be put off by this because it was worth one night of sleeping not too well. The next day, they woke us up ready to see sunrise, had another really jive breakfast before we rode the camels out if camp and started our journey back. Again we could of stopped in a a few museums but as I was tired I slept and wanted to just get back so our stops were limited. A truly outstanding tour, company and guides. There is so many more good things to say but my fingers are hurting any questions please let me know and il try and help"

We have just returned from a month overseas and I felt compelled to write about the amazing time we had with Morocco active adventures. Right from the outset, Joussef spent a lot of time going over the trip in detail and was very reassuring, considering we were booking at very short notice as we weren't sure of the conditions being suitable for a desert trip with two young boys aged 9 and 11 in July, until we got to Morocco. We felt far more comfortable and confident after speaking to him over any other groups we had spoken to.Abdul our driver was the best! Very friendly, easy going and accommodating. He took every effort to meet our specific, individualised needs - even to the extent that he sourced great places to stay with swimming pools in the most unlikely of locations, when my youngest wanted to have a swim after a hot day travelling! He also went out of his way to help us deal with a problem that occurred in the Riad that we had been staying at in Marrakesh. His service was not only above and beyond, but we had no doubt that it was from a genuine concern for us all having a good time. From Marrakesh to the overnight desert camp in the Sahara and back to Essouira over 4 days, we owe all the amazing things that we experienced to Abdul. We consider him a friend and were sad to say goodbye. I hope our paths cross again. It was a once in a life time journey. I have no hesitations in highly recommending this company, they are worth every penny - in return for a priceless experience."

We went during Ramadan so considering his limitations he was brilliant.The itinerary they offer is a lot of fun - we especially enjoyed the walk to the waterfalls and the quad biking. There is a lot of driving involved but the views are amazing - especially all the changes in scenery and colours.Would highly recommend this to anyone. Even though Morocco is quite cheap and this might seem like high initial cost - you definitely get value for the whole day and see so much you would otherwise miss.Final comment goes to the organisation of the day trip. The website offers chat using whatsapp which made communication and organising very easy for us.Would definitely use this company again if we go back."

I was traveling with my two daughters, ages 21 and 17, and we had Youssef Bani as a guide. He was absolutely wonderful. One of my daughters was ill on the first day, and he was patient and accommodating, allowing us to leave at 2 p.m. instead of 8 a.m. He took us to some amazing places that I don't think we would have seen on a different tour, and throughout the four days he was consistently professional, while also being very warm and friendly, throwing in extras such as midnight sand-boarding for my two girls who were up for more adventure than I was. Although we spent over a week in Morocco, the four days we spent on this tour were definitely the highlight of our trip. I would DEFINITELY recommend this trip, and especially Youssef, to anyone up for a fun, adventurous tour."

We were 14 people in total. 4 couples late 50s/early 60s, six young folk...20s...We all clicked very well. Yassine, our guide, was a 29 year old Moroccan. Amazing ambassador for his country. This is an \"adventure\" tour so you are staying in interesting, quaint hotels. You are travelling in a comfortable van. We covered just over 3000 km. There were lots of stops along the way. There's free time and you are not obliged to eat or always be with the group. All breakfasts were included and about 4 lunches and 4 dinners. You experience local sights with local guides. We rode camels and camped one night in the desert. We walked up a mountain path and stayed overnight with a family, kind of like their version of a bed and breakfast. We had a fish fry over charcoal at a fishing port. Ate in the markets at the food stalls in Marrakech. I felt that that this trip was excellent value for the cost. We all enjoyed ourselves and we did not all know each other before hand. There was flexibility in what you did or did not do....but we mostly all always did all of what was offered. If you are looking for luxury and five stars....this is not your trip. But if you want a wonderful \"experience\", see how the country really is and get an education about this interesting country, try this G Adventures trip."

We visited a Berber family where we drank tea, rode a Camel and did a donkey ride through the mountain, taking us to a family where we would had lunch. We finished the day after a beautiful ride to the desert through the mountains to have a mesmerizing squad ride during sunset. What gave our trip an extra was our great guide Youssef Bani, a very kind, knowledgeable young man who did everything to teach us about the culture and to make us feel welcome. We loved the music he played us in the car (a comfortable 4-wheel drive) as well :-)"

From the moment we met our guide Yussef and driver Mustapha we felt very welcome and excited for all the activities we'd be doing. The rock climbing, hiking and quad biking had been arranged brilliantly and everything went very smoothly, even though we were a bit of a roudy bunch at times! The camel ride to the Berber camp in the desert was definitely a highlight of the trip and the stargazing there was spectacular.

Since Youssef grew up in a Berber family himself, he took us to a a real family living in a cave, to have tea with them. The entire trip felt really \"real\" and was just flabbergasting! I can very highly recommend it!Some of the highlights were driving over the Atlas Mountains after it had snowed, climbing up a cave to meet with the Berber family, Yousseff willing to accomodate us when we said we were climbers (he tried to arrange a short climbing activity for us on the spot), amazing hotel on the way, sleeping in the desert!, riding camels etc etcJust book this trip, you won't regret it!"

Over 2 and a half days, we gained a much deeper understanding of the Moroccan people and their culture and the history and stories behind the places we went. We left as strangers but completed our tour as friends. The camel ride into the Sahara dessert was breathtaking, and nature delivered us a truly authentic experience with lots of wind and blowing sand. How we appreciated the Moroccan shesh (turban) that covered our heads and faces! Good food, a Moroccan drum performance with audience participation, comfortable beds in private tents, and yes...a flush toilet. The staff was friendly and funny and stopped often for photo opportunities. Don't miss it."

We went on a 4 day trip with Mohamed and Youssef to the Merzouga desert and back to Marrakech with 4 persons.The first day they picked us up at the hotel precisely at 8 AM to start the tour. With our luggage on top of the car we left with \"gierende banden!\" in a very comfortable Toyota 4x4 to the High Atlas Mountains. Mo and Youssef where very good companions on our trip, although we didn't speak French and Youssefs English was limited. Mo could tell us a lot about Morocco which made the long car ride very interesting. Driving up the atlas gave us some amazing views. We continued the ride through the Dades Valley and the Valley of the Roses, too bad it wasn't the right season, for we did only see a few roses there. The day stopped at the Tinghir Valley, where we stayed in a small riad with a beautiful view over the valley. Here we had dinner and enjoyed a night with music played by the owner and staff.The second day we started with a visit to berbers in their cave to drink some tea. After that some rock climbing, a climb of about 20 meters, which was very nice to do and also very accessible for non experienced climbers. Then we continued our trip to the Merzouga desert. Arriving in our room we took only the necessary stuff with us to travel to our camp for the night, a one hour camel ride away. The ride was a very exciting experience, with beautiful sights of the desert. Beware of sore legs after haha! The next day we watched the sunrise, which was nice but not that special, since the sunrise was at the not desert side of the camp. It was possible to go sand boarding, we tried it, but since the boards where in bad condition and it was impossible to tighten your feet. You could only slide down and walk back up. The ride back was pretty good, and back in the riad we could wash all the sand away with a refreshing shower. Then, what I think, came one of the best things of the trip: Quad biking through the desert. After a short introduction by Mohamed (Another one, I think about 96% of the people is called Mohamed there) we went for a nice drive through the sand dunes. Mohamed really took the time to make everyone in the group feel comfortable with the quads and the dunes. We took some high dunes and steep rides down which were very cool to do. After the quad biking we drove to a big riad in Quarzazate with a swimming pool, pretty good.Last day we visited The Atlas Film studios and Ait Ben Haddou, an old town with lots of tourists. We also did some offroad with Youssef which was nice. Then we drove back over the Atlas Mountains to our hotel.We look back on an excellent trip and special thanks to Mohamed and Youssef! Who learned us to talk like berbers and make camel sounds, or was it the other way around? Thanks guys! Spartacus!"

Mohamad worked closely with us for couple of weeks over phone/WhatsApp/email in the run-up to the trip to cover all of our requirements and build a customized trip. We are a family of 3 with a 5 yr old with some dietary constraints and demanding to see most of Morocco within 8 days.  After a relaxing flight in business class on latest acfts of Qatar Airways (SIN-DOH A350 and DOH-CMN on 787) we were warmly greeted by Abellatif Essaleh Amanar at Casablanca Airport. Abellatif was a very safe and courteous driver who looked after the tiniest of our needs. He ensured we had a safe vacation and didn\u2019t miss any anything. He also doubled up as guide (although we had dedicated guides at all attractions) with his very good English, contextual knowledge is a walking encyclopedia \u2013 it was very helpful and appreciated. We must say he is indeed the best driver/guide we have experienced from all our visits around the world. An amateur music composer with compilations on youtube. He made the long drives seem very short with his songs, chat about Berber cultures, local experiences and education as we passed landmarks. We got very close to him during the 8 days. In fact, he even invited us to his place in Marrakech for dinner with family. We were amazed and privileged to experience such a warm Moroccan hospitality. We now have a friendship to cherish.  We highly recommend Morocco Active Adventures and Abellatif to all who is planning their next trip to Morocco. Excellent service."

The berber families who we shared breakfast and lunch with were also kind and friendly and seemed genuinely excited to share their life with us. We went on a camel ride, mule trek, walk to the waterfalls and quad biking to finish the day. Moubark our driver was also such a kind, honest and hilariously funny gent and made us feel safe the whole trip, even though driving on the crazy mountain roads. Learning about the culture, taking amazing pictures and eating some of the best home made food you'll ever taste made the trip amazing but sharing the day with Hassan and Moubark made the day so much more memorable and an experience we will never forget.

They took us for breakfast at a traditional Berber village; which was delicious. After that we went for a short dromedary ride.

We continued with the mule ride until we came to a very scenic waterfall, which was a lovely reprieve from the heat.FOLLOWING ALL THAT: we went for a quad-bike drive through the desert against the landscape and the sunset. In summary, it was a really busy day! We did so many things and travelled so far. Our tour guides were wonderful; made an effort to properly get to know us, engaged in lively and jocular conversation, despite an obvious language barrier, and were only too happy to accommodate our requests.5/7 would recommend to everyone."

Then onto the camel rides followed by a mule ride into the mountains. Without doubt this was the highlight of the trip. The views were stunning. Breathtaking. Ali was busy taking amazing photos for me and I was on the mule with my daughter and my wife on another mule. The place where we had lunch was mind boggling. A different world. So relaxing. Views stunning.After lunch we took the mule back down the mountain and to Imlil where we started off.

He was on time to arrive and had water bottles ready for us, which was very kind.

We went through at least a dozen itineraries offered from the other operators, and this one had all the things we wanted to do and all in a one-day trip!We were picked up directly from our Riad and then taken in a very safe/reliable 4x4 SUV to the various locations/activities: tea/breakfast at a local Berber family-house, then camel-riding for 20 minutes (which is more than enough time for the novelty of it), then a more comfortable ride on a mule to a waterfall - which was pretty damn cool and which had a shack with locals providing freshly squeezed OJ, then mule-rode to a Berber house in the mountains and had lunch on the rooftop with a nice view of Atlas Mountains, then to a lake where people jet ski and stuff, and finally quad biking in the sand dunes/hills. The other tours have you riding a camel for waaaay too long (IMO) and either don't have the waterfall bit or the quad biking bit all combined into one day (we got back to Medina at 7pm).Ali was our guide and was excellent. He cracked jokes and went out of his way to make sure we were having a great time.Thanks!"

            "review": "A must do!. My boyfriend and I (ages 23 and 25) booked to do this trip to do on my birthday. Right from the start, Mohammed was great at corresponding with us, making sure everything was arranged before we got to Marrakech and giving us tips. We were picked up at 8.15 (Mohammed emailed to confirm the day before which I was impressed with) and went to a Berber house which was a great and insightful experience. I believe that no other trips do a few different villages! The mule ride was my highlight going up and down the mountain and to villages although at some points it was so steep and narrow I was fearing for my life a bit but that just added to the experience. The lunch was chicken kebabs, homemade bread and then a lamb tagine with potatoes and vegetables which was delicious and it was great that they had remembered my boyfriend is a vegetarian so he was provided with a vegetarian tagine which he said was the best veggie dish he has ever had! The trip is definitely worth the value and is pretty much a 11/12 hour day packed with different things and we basically had a private tour as it was just the two of us in a 4x4 with Yousef which was great. Definitely an experience we won't be forgetting and was a great day out of Marrakech. Would highly recommend!"

I wanted to do something memorable for my 40th Birthday and after much research on various tours in morocco I kept coming back to Morocco Active Adventures. If your looking for culture, tradition, history, fun activities, great food and warm friendly people, then this is the tour for you, this tour gives you the whole moroccan experience and a great time. This was the best experience i had in marrakech and far exceeded my expectations. It was a great tour with many things to do, see and experience and my guide youssef was fantastic!,he was very accommodating especially to my dietary needs, knowledgeable, informative, warm, friendly and patient. I felt extremely safe with youssef the whole day and he really made my trip one to remember ! Most definately an asset to Moroccan active adventures, keep up the good work Youssef.I booked my tour direct through email (morrocanactiveadventures@gmail.com) it was that quick and easy ! I booked my tour last Saturday, flew to Morroco on Sunday and was experiencing my tour first thing on the monday morning (my birthday !)I was picked up from my hotel promptly at 8.00am by my guide Youssef and drove about an hour to the Atlas Mountain through the Ourikka Valley. we stopped in a Berber village where we visited a Berber house to find out how Moroccan and Berber families live, and was a chance to share a local traditional Berber breakfast which allows you to have a taste of real pure homemade ingredients and made a lovely change from the taste of processed ingredients we are normally used to, made by the family, and to learn a bit about them and the history of the Berber people. After a short drive, we stopped to have a camel ride which i really enjoyed. We then drove through the beautiful mountain scenery with amazing colourful landscapes, crossing several authentic Berber villages until we reached the village Imlill via different rivers and Valleys such as Asni Valley. From here, we met with a local expert mountain guide and had a peaceful serene ride on a mule to another Berber house where we had traditionally made mint tea followed by a delicious lunch offered by the local family. After lunch, we went hiking/trekking to the waterfalls, which i found beautiful calming and peaceful. We then drive back on a different road to Marrakech, via Lala Takarkoust where i thoroughly enjoyed myself quad biking!I really enjoyed my trip to Morocco and my tour to the Atlas Mountain and hope to visit morocco again in the near future as i would love to experience the desert tour with Moroccan Active Adventures. This is a must do tour if you are visiting Morocco!! :) Shukraan to Mohammed and Shukraan so much youssef, hope to see you again.Salaam Alaikum"

            "review": "An amazing experience. I cannot fault this company. Our day trip to the Atlas Mountains was flawless from start to finish. Rashid was our guide while Ibrahim did the driving. Both were exceptional. There was nothing Rashid did not know, and he instantly made you feel at ease with him. Being a Berber himself, he knew things that other guides simply would not know. His fun, adventurous personality alongside his knowledge of Moroccan culture and history was staggering and we learnt so much from him. Ibrahim was, well, a good driver as well! It's not easy to navigate the small, dangerous roads which line the sides of mountains but he did it calmly and efficiently and never made us feel concerned. As for the trip itself - it was the highlight of our short stay in Marrakech. We soon learned that you had to go outside the city to experience 'real' Morocco and had we not done this, our opinion of the country would be unfathomably different. If you're considering booking an excursion while you're here, don't hesitate - just do it, and I can highly recommend this company - and I have pretty high standards.For our particular trip (Atlas Mountains day trip) we were picked up from the Riad at 08:00 and from there we had a 30min or so drive to a Berber house. We could look around and see how they made their food and lived, and then the Wife of the house made us Tea (which was gorgeous) and bread. We then drove further and had a short camel ride, after which a mule ride higher up into the mountains followed by a short trek. The mule ride was great - and was such an insight into how the Berber people lived. It is an exhilarating experience being atop a mule on such perilous pathways, going higher and higher (and then down, which is actually more scary) and putting your trust into the two mule-keeper guys who barely speak any English. But in fact they seriously know what they're doing because well, they do it every day. So don't be concerned. We then went on to a second Berber house to have some lunch and (you guessed it) more tea! The food was really good and the snow capped mountains in front of you were such an amazing view. Our guide gave us some typical Berber clothes to try on (something the other one didn't) which just serves to show how this company will go above and beyond to make your experience a little better.The day ended with an hour of quad biking. This was great and will most definitely cater well for any adrenaline junkies out there, myself included. The quads were in good condition, the tracks fun and enjoyable with some great sights along the way. We were dropped back to our Riad at about 7pm, just in time for a good picture of the sunset. Oh yes - they have no problem letting you stop for as many pictures as you want as you go up the mountains, so for all you snap-happy people, fear not. I would like to thank both Rashid and Ibrahim for being such spectacular guides. Both of you are lovely people - keep doing what you're doing. Maybe I'll see you another time."

Just back from the most amazing trip to Morocco where we decided we wanted to see a little bit more than just Marrakesh. Therefore we booked a 4 day trek with moroccoactiveadventures and from the moment our guide Ali picked us us up from our Riad to the moment he dropped us back we had the adventure of a lilfetime.Driving through the Atlas mountains was simply breathtaking as was visiting Ben Haddou Kasbah, a world heritage site followed by the amazing Boumalen Dades famous by its Dades Gorges. Our first night we were blown away to stay in the most amazing 4 star hotel greeted in a tradional Berber way as we walked through the reception. Sat and watched the sunset with a cold Casablanca beer followed by a traditional Hammam massage (naked...who knew?) and wonderful buffet dinner with local red wine.The highlight of day 2 was reaching the Sahara and trekking across the Sahara desert by Camel for a few hours to reach a Berber camp where we met 4 other travellers and were treated to a Moroccan feast and Berber drums and singing and dancing. Such fun! At bedtime we were given a hot water bottle each and our own little Berber tent with double bed and heaps of blankets as it gets so very cold during the night. We lay on the dunes looking at the stars for quite a while....spectacular.... you almost touch them!I will never forget the sights and sounds of Morocco. The camels and goats on the roadside and dusty markets and souks that made you feel like you had been transported back to another age in time. Our 3rd night was in another wonderful Riad with so much charm and beauty. Our guide Ali was marvellous.....went far and beyond the call of duty. He was always smiling and helpful and went out of his way to ensure our trip was memorable. A really lovely guy...very traditional and humble. We miss him and can't wait to book another tour with this wonderful company. You literally contact them with what you'd ideally like to do and what your budget is and they put together a trek based on this. We were expecting to slum it at times but this was far from the truth....We felt like royalty. Thankyou Mohammed for organising our trip and to Ali for the magical journey you took us on and your friendship :)"

We were pushed for time as we were only in Morocco for three days so we booked this action packed one day tour and we were very glad we did. Our guide Youssef was fantastic, friendly, informative, good fun and really made us feel we had some basic understand of the culture of Morocco. The day was full of interest including camel riding, quad biking in the desert, mule riding a fantastic lunch in a Berber home and hiking to a waterfall. We enjoyed every minute as did our 13 year old daughter who was kept enthralled and occupied. When we re visit Marrakesh we will go for longer and book with this company again for a longer tour. The whole event was very professional and easy with Youssef picking us up promptly form the foyer of our Hotel at 8am."

            "review": "What a wonderful trip to Sahara!!!. We just came back from a 4 day trip to Sahara (Merzouga) from Marrakech. It was an unforgettable and very exciting experience! I loved it. My favorite moments were entering Sahara on the camels, quad biking, and looking at the stars at night! I was amazed. Our guide was Youssef, and he was great. He is fun, patient, trustworthy and very knowledgeable, we learned so much about local culture! We joined another couple who turned out to be great companions, so it was 4 of us, which I think is the best way. Initially, I was considering 3 day tour, but I am happy we did 4 days because we had time for quad biking after the sunrise and got to see couple additional places, and weren't driving all day. While on the road, the scenery is constantly changing from mountains to dessert and it's so beautiful that the drive itself is enjoyable too. Youssef also considered our individual needs / desires and was very helpful throughout the trip. The company also provides additional bonus of free shuttle to or from the airport if they have available cars, so it was very nice of them to do that for us. I would definitely recommend Youssef and this company to anyone interested in adventures!!!! :)"

I would really want to recommend to travel with Morocco Active Adventures!Me and my boyfriend had a 4day-trip with Morocco Active Adventures, Marrakech<->Merzouga Desert, which for me was one of the best trips I've done!All events and parts of the trip held a high standard, which made us feel safe and comfortable the whole time. At the same time the trip contained unique experiences, surprises and adrenalin kicks.We had the opportunitity to do the trip together with two other girls, which made us a group of 5 people with the guide - This felt like a good group size and possible to fit in one car. Being a small group made it possible to be flexible and have personal requests about the itinerary.What really made our trip special and great was our guide (and new friend!) Youssef! While being both personal and professional, he taught us about the Moroccan and Berber history, answered all our thousands questions and made us experience a multifaceted and authentic Morocco."

I must say it was an unforgettable unique experience. Our guide was FANTASTIC, probably the best thing in the trip, he was a true berber who knew the culture and history of the whole country. Also, very important he was a very safe driver, which considering how much you travel should be a priority. His name is Ismeil and if you can ask for him. He went out of his way ordering Berber pizza which we wanted to try and setting us up for an authentic Moroccan barbeque. He also knew where to stop to take beautiful pictures. The hotel we stayed the first night was small and modest but we had a delightful host which served an amazing dinner. The views from his riad are also beautiful. The camel trek and desert were also a unique experience. The car used for the trip was very comfortable and well kept. It had bluetooth and a usb charger so feel free to bring your own playlist and also charge your devices. The one downside was the guide we hired in Ait Ben Hadou, this has nothing to do with the company, but i just wish he bad better english. Despite this I cannot recommend this tour company enough. Book your trip and enjoy, ask for Ismail for a superb, authentic experience!Greetings from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil."

You really do not need to look anywhere else when finding an day trip to the Atlas Mountains which includes camel and mule rides PLUS quad biking!! Ali the amazing friendly tour guide picks you up from your hotel/riad at 8am then your magical trip begins. First you drive up to a traditional village house for some tea and bread/dates/fruits while there you can have a tour of the house, theres chickens, cows , lovely views at the top of the stairs also. Next stop is the camel ride! Short and sweet 20min camel ride with again lovely views of the mountains! Ali is always offering to take pictures and is very helpful! Then after an hour of driving (it does not seem that long when you are admiring the beautiful views, Ali always offers stop the car for us to take pictures. He also gives interesting facts and information about the Berber villages and towns). Once you reach the Berber village you are taken on an amazing mule ride it truly is an amazing feeling to be able to ride a mule plus looking at the most breathtaking views! You then take a short walk to the waterfalls (I personally found this waterfall better than the Ouzoud, it had clear water running down). After the waterfalls you can either go back on the mules or walk, we did both and the mules walk with us till the end of the atlas mountain part of the trip. Next was an amazing Moroccan lunch (best food we've had in Marrakech) in a Berber house with a panoramic view of the Atlas mountain, it was truly an amazing experience. Back in the car we go to the quad bikes but that's after we take a stop at another glorious view. That's it. So many activities in one day. Don't look anywhere else this is the best trip to the Atlas Mountains!!! Thank you once again Ali you were an incredible tour guide!!"

We booked the 3 day tour from Marrakech because of the great reviews and can honestly say we were not at all disappointed. Ali, our guide was brilliant. Everytime we stopped anywhere he knew people and wouldn't let us get hassled or pressured into buying anything! We had a slightly extended drive (due to terrible weather) to Boumaine du dades through the most wonderful countryside stopping along the route to eat and wonder round the Kasbar. We stayed in a hotel with the biggest beds I've ever seen and although the food wasn't great it didn't detract from the tour. The following day we drove to Merzouga for our camel ride into the sunset to stay in a Berber tent. Amazing. The camp was great, food fantastic and camp fire very necessary (it was very cold at night) and it even had a working toilet (not traditional I know but very welcome). Next morning we were up early for sunrise, back on our camels and back via more amazing scenery including the snow covered high Atlas Mountains, and finally back to Marrakech.Ali, our driver was truly wonderful, we felt very looked after. He is very knowledgeable and bought us, pizza from his home town of Rissani which we had for dinner after he dropped us back to our Riad. Also, and very importantly, the car was extremely comfortable which was very important as we spent a lot of time driving through the Maroccan countryside. thank you also to jousef for great communication before and after the tour. This is a great company. I really would highly recommend it."

My friends and I had no idea what to expect, but because of our tour guides (Jose and Abdul), we had the experience of a lifetime. We were only in Morocco for 2 and a half days so this tour allowed us to do so much in one day: camel riding, atv riding, hiking the atlas mountains, mule riding, and having breakfast and lunch with a traditional berber family. Jose and Abdul were kind, funny, and so helpful throughout the whole day. They taught us so much about the culture and really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great day. Jose even was photographing each activity and he captured so many amazing photos. He also was able to connect with us through Facebook so getting the photos was easy as can be. Overall, I had the most incredible time and I already want to come back and do a longer tour with this company.

I might sound like a marketing staff from the tour company but I promise you in didn't get paid at all!!! LOL Imagine while other tourists are walking in the gorge you are already trying to climb up the rocky mountain for the very first time; while others are still immersed in the excitement of riding a camel, you have already hopped off the hump and jumped up and down various dunes in a 4 wheelers like in an 80s adventure movie set; while others travel for an hour just to visit a Berber family, you have a Berber guide by your side all day long, not to mention the chance to see Berber family in the Cave! All along with other stuff add up to an 4-day unforgettable experience for me and 2 other friends.Our guide Youssef is too good to be true. He's super considerate all the way, considerate like your family. Attractive and funny and a man with enough knowledge of his country and culture. Any questions you can shoot and you'll end up falling in love with this magical place without feeling like a total stranger. I think it's him that make Morocco, Berber culture and the whole trip so special. Also, his English is phenomenal which makes communication much easier and much more fun. I believe his French Spanish or Berber, now a bit of Chinese as well will contribute a lot to your trip. I'm usually a backpacker. But this trip is even better than backpacking. I know it sounds surreal but tell me how you would feel when Youssef turned a blizzard road closure into a breathtaking snow mountain siteseeing. And most importantly, Youssef is a very professional guide. Everything is arranged perfectly even with unexpected events and there's no unnecessary shopping and extra fees at all. I know it could be a bit daunting to try new things and price might not be cheap as those bus tours.

We booked a three day tour from Marrakech, visiting the High Atlas, Ksar A\u00eft Ben Haddou, the Todra Gorge, the wells near Erfoud, Ouarzazate, Valley Of The Roses, camel ride into the Sahara from Merzouga and more.Unfortunately for us, the tour was postponed by a day (due to heavy snowfall in the High Atlas pass!), but our guide Ali couldn't have been more helpful.Not only did he rearrange our tour, he also spoke to our riad to re-arrange our bookings, and kept us fully informed of what was going on.On the tour itself Ali was always happy to explain things to us, and really helped us get a feel for his beautiful country.The tour was a pleasure. If you're lucky enough to get Ali, ask him to help you find the local 'pizza' that's the speciality of Risanni - it's delicious.Thanks again..."

My tour guides (Jose and Abdul) were amazing and planned everything perfectly. They were so polite and personable and taught my group and I so much about Morocco in such a short period of time. This trip was so great that I am already planning another one with the same company (hopefully same tour guides) for sometime in the future with my family. Thank you so much to Jose and Abdul for the great experience!!"

Our tourguides Jose and Abdul were very friendly and were very knowledgable. It was very convenient (they were able to pick us up at our hostel) and worth every single pennyy. We were able to do so many incredible things in one day (camel rides, mule rides, hiking, atving and breakfast and lunch in a small village). I hope to come back and use the same company to explore even more of Morocco."

We did the one day active tour through the Atlas Mountains with the camel ride, donkey ride, traditional Berber breakfast and lunch, as well as ATV riding. Honestly this experience exceeded any and all expectations we had. Jose and Abdul were amazing guides and they really made the experience for us. This tour was well worth the price and you won't regret it!! It was better than any other tours offered since they really show you the culture and life of the Berber people. A trip myself and my group will never forget. Thanks again Jose, Abdul, and Moroccan Active Adventures for the trip of a lifetime!"

Abdul was a great guide, we drove a comfortable spacious car hundreds of miles through the highest pass in Morocco in the amazing Atlas Mountains . We were disappointed not to see round the studios as we thought that was part of the trip but time was precious.the camel rides and the sunset in the Zagora desert was a treat. The Berber tents were luxurious and the drumming and singing into the night were great. Next day, our return was dashed by a huge dump of snow in the mountains, the first of the winter! This meant we had to divert round Agadir. Nothing was too much trouble for our guide and he found us a great eatery on the long journey.we would recommend books and in car entertainment as although the views were stunning and there was lots to talk about, you might find 13 hours of driving hard! Next time, we would use the same company and have a trip tailored to our needs. The company is amenable to anything. Not just the trips on the website!"

My GF and I had a private guide, that drove us from Marrakech to the Merzouga desert, where we rode camels, tried sand boarding, watched the sunset and the stars in the night and finally also slept there. The next two days, we also got to see very interesting stuff. For example, we had a tour in film studios, where game of thrones, Gladiator, the mummy etc. were filmed and we visited nommads living in caves in the mountains. The guide was very friendly and knew how to treat western folks, such that we had time on our own, but also gained some interesting insights, when he pointed out cultural and other Maroccan specific background information. Overall I would recommend to everyone interested in travelling to book a tour with those guys. One more thing: the contact before our tour was very easy, friendly and reliable. I could just write messages in WhatsApp and seconds later, I already got an answer."

Our driver met us in the lobby of our Riad at 8am and drove us about 30 minutes outside of the city where we had breakfast (tea and homemade bread with honey, butter and oil) with a local family. We got back in the car and stopped for a quick 15 minute camel ride (great photo opp). After that we had the option to ride a mule or hike to a nearby waterfall - my husband hiked wit the guide and I rode the mule. After the waterfall we rode mules to another local village and had lunch overlooking the town. View was amazing and the food was delicious. We drove for a while and then stopped to ride quads for an hour or so. The quad guide invited us to tea before going back to the car. Overall, it was an incredible to experience so much culture in one day. It was adventurous but not overwhelming; the guide really caters to each personality. No place we went felt like a tourist trap. Very authentic and I would highly recommend!!"

Not only did we get engaged in the most romantic setting you can imagine (after a camel ride on top of a sanddune in the desert during sunset), but our guide Abdul made sure we had a one in a lifetime experience!He picked us up from our Riad in the morning and from the very first moment we liked his positive aura. He is very educated and talks very passionately about Morocco. It was such a pleasure listening to him, he taught us a lot about the Berber culture and all the places we visited. He was very caring, making sure we always had enough to drink in the car, or offered to stop the car for taking pictures or bathroom breaks. He always gave 110 percent, explained everything very well and we immediately felt like as if a friend was showing us around. Besides being the absolute best tour guide you can wish for, Abdul is also a gifted musician. He played the most beautiful songs for us while driving through this breathtaking scenery. Every time we listen to one of his songs now, we only need to close our eyes and we see all of those magical places again in our minds: the High Atlas, Kasbah Ait Ben Haddou,Kella Mgauna, Dades valley, Dades gorge, Tinerhit, Erfoud, Risani, Ouarzazate, Erg Chebbi, Alnif, Draa Valley etc... Probably the best part of the tour besides experiencing the width of this magnificent country was staying in a camp in the desert and sleeping in a Berber tent. The people in the camp were incredibly welcoming and went out of their way to celebrate our engagement with us. After dinner, they even surprised us with a song and a big cake with our names on it! Thank you guys, this memory will always be in our hearts and we promise that we will come back to the desert!Abdul and Joussef both made sure that we would get to the desert before the sunset and we want to thank you again for how wonderful you treated us! We felt very special! Abdul stayed with us for a while in the camp, he played different instruments with us and sang beautiful songs with his amazing voice, we simply loved it! Sleeping in the tents was super comfortable, they provided plenty of blankets, we didn't even need them all. We were surprised by the bathrooms in the camp, it made everything feel pretty luxurious. We would recommend anyone who is interested in learning more about the country and the rich culture of the Tamazight to book a tour and ask for Abdul (his English is great!). The booking process needs to be mentioned too. Joussef made everything very easy, he responded quickly via Whatsapp to our questions. They are real pros and we will definitely come back for another tour! We are so grateful for this experience and feel like we have found a true friend in Abdul."

As a maturish/ish active couple, we don't usually do 'organised' travel, but on a short three day break to Marrakech, we looked and saw Morocco Active Adventures and emailed/booked a full day trip to the Atlas mountains. The best decision ever!! Mohamed was brilliant with the pre and after email organisation, and our guide for the day, Abdul, was just amazing. Just us two, every single part of the day, the five different activities and people involved, were superb. Abdul was engaging, thoughtful and told us so much about the history of Morocco and the Berber people.We had a wonderful breakfast with a Berber family which felt like genuine hospitality, followed by a camel ride, a 3 hour mule trek up through several Berber mountain villages to a lunch with another family, onto a small trek to a waterfall, then back to the car and a drive back down from the mountains to an hours quad biking in the desert and a spectacular sunset. Every part of the 'team' really made sure we were enjoying our experience.... no expectation of tips. But my tip, would be to make sure you do have some cash on hand because we genuinely felt that Mohamed made sure to use small family groups to benefit both parties, a little extra for them ...... and a huge privilege for us. I wish I'd had a bit more cash, and I'd have loved to have had a few very little bits for the children we saw, happily playing with spinning tops. Absolutely not necessary nor expected....but we got so much from the day.We are already planning to go back to Morocco, to try another Morocco Active Adventure"

Had a fantastic tour guide and conversation kept flowing...this was one of the best excursion i have ever done. Most importantly, the highlight of my Marrakech trip.My advice to othera: do where comfortable hiking boots/walking shoes, bring wet wipes and a bottle of water. If you need something do not be afraid to ask the tour guide...they will make a pit stop etc.A big big big thank you to everyone at All Trails Tour. I will be booking through this company again when i visit other cities in Morocco.I highly recommend this company."

We were looking for an option for private tours rather than joining group tours that were offered through the travel agency I used to book the trip, and so glad that we made this decision! Our driver was great with very good English. If you are looking for something slightly different to your family tour then I definitely recommend you get hold of them for the Sahara Tour, you won't regret it!!"

Day 1: Picked us up at hotel and drove through the mountains which were beuatiful, then visited a famous/awesome Kasbah where we had lunch. Then continued through the country stopping a few times and then arrived at our hotel for the night. Day 2: Left hotel in morning and then visited an awesome Gorge, Oasis, and town. Absolutly stunning scenery. Also had the opporutunity to visit a nomad family who lived in the mountain side (amazing experience), then continued on visiting ancient desert water wells and a fossil processing plant. Lastly dropped off at the edge of the true desert for the camel ride. This was the highlight of the trip and was surreal. Camped overnight in the desert and looked at the stars for hours among the dunes after a great dinner and music. Day 3: Left on the camels right at Sunrise and got back to hotel, then a lot of driving back to Marrakech. Overall a near perfect Moroccan adventure among out of this world/time scenery. One of the most important aspects of this was our tour guide. He made the vacation/tour unforgettable instead of merely great. Was extremely intelligent, spoke English well, passionate about his country/culture, and was really friendly. Helpful in every way. If you are an English speaker make sure you request Abdul!"

He is an amazing driver and an awesome tour guide. I hope you like off roading and going off the beaten path. We started our trip off seeing the mountains, the gorge was spectacular and met a family of nomads that lived in a cave. They invited us to their home and we all had tea. Everyone we came across was friendly and welcoming, I learned so much about Morrocco and the culture. You'll be eating real Moroccan food, it's yummy! If you're looking for a unique adventure this is it. I highly recommend it. The food and accommodations were amazing, stayed at the Xaluca dades hotel we received a royal welcome of singing at the entrance. Not expected at all! Driving through the desert was amazing but the camel ride was into the desert was the best! After the camel ride you enter a camp site in the middle of what appeared to be nowhere. Don't worry, there is a washroom. We shared the camp site, with a small group of tourists. The stars at night were stunning. The Berber music really set tone for the evening. You'll be able to see some animals, mostly cats, I saw a bat and mouse prints in the sand. Best trip of all time! I would go back in a heart beat. Thank you Youssef!"

All the reviews so far are spot on, you can't go wrong booking with these! I traveled to Marrakesh with 3 other girls (in our 30's) for a week in Sept and we wanted to experience more than just the city life, but we only had a couple of days to spare.Morrocco Active Adventures came up with the perfect package for us, ticking all the boxes....camel ride, hiking, waterfalls, experiencing Berber culture and quad biking spread over 2 days.Our wonderful guide Abdul picked us up at our hotel on time, in a comfortable jeep to start our adventure! Abdul entertained us while we made our way to the Atlas Mountains. He gave us really good insight to Berber culture and Morocco in general, it was really interesting! We were able to have a laugh with him too, which added to the overall experience.We stopped to do the Camel ride first, which was good fun. It was the first time for me so it was a novelty and the guide that took us up the track was really friendly. You can take pictures as you please and you don't feel under pressure to tip.Abdul then took us on to our next stop which was a traditional Berber family home. We were shown around the house met the family, they were so nice. The grandmother showed us how to make a proper sweet mint tea and gave us freshly baked bread with local preserves etc. I also got some Henna done by the young girl in the family. All the time Abdul was translating from Berber to English and we were able to interact with the family. It was a really humble experience. The Atlas Mountains are beautiful, especially in the valleys. We arrived in a village, where we went on a short hike to some waterfalls. Our guide was really sound, he didn't rush us, we could stop and take photos and rest when we needed to. It was really enjoyable.Abdul then met us again and drove us to the next village we would stay for the night. We got our evening meal in another traditional Berber house, in the middle of the mountains where we saw the sunset and had a gorgeous lamb tagine cooked by the family. It was so tasty! We learned some Berber words! That night we stayed in a small hostel down the road, pretty basic. 1 room with 4 single beds, shower facilities. It did the job, don't expect luxury! :) We had fresh pancakes and mint tea in the morning before we set off to do our 4hour hike around the mountains. Our guide was a young local Berber lad, who knew the area very well. His English wasn't amazing, but he got his message across. It was a nice temperature for hiking, not too hot. The scenery is beautiful, very diverse and hard to believe the dessert is only a few hours away!We arrived at another village where we got our lunch served at a local restaurant along the river. Don't expect amazing food here....it's in the middle of the mountains! Before we set off we got a mule ride through the village in these narrow streets, it was a lot of fun! The locals were so nice and welcoming. Our last stop was the quad biking, it was brilliant! Great track where got to let rip but they were still very safety conscience. They took pictures in the middle of it. You will get dirty.....as it is all sand and dust, but I would recommend it if you like a bit of speed!We got dropped back to our hotel that evening after a fantastic adventure! I would highly recommend this tour company to anyone! It was extremely good value for everything we got and I couldn't say more positive things about our guide Abdul!"

At the beginning we weren't very sure about our choice because there are many agencies offering similar services, however it worth every Euro, believe me. We hire the private tour from Marrakesh to the Merzouga desert, our driver Mohammed made the trip really interesting and fun. It was very valuable that Mohammed was completely flexible to stop every time we wanted for a picture or to rest and go to the bathroom. The restaurants and hotels along the trip are very good options because you don't miss a typical meal or you get to stay in beautiful Riads without compromising your comfort or safety. The all wheel drive van was confortable and had all the equipment to enjoy the trip AC, seat belts, nice seats, etc. While in the road we had the opportunity to visit the \"Atlas\" film studios,Todra Gorges, Dades Valley, some local markets and obviously the Merzouga desert experience and camping was amazing! When we got back to Marrakesh the company provide us a local guide called Aziza which was very friendly and knew a lot about the surroundings. Definitely a very good experience I recommend and would take again if possible."

From the minute Youssef picked us up from our Riad we had a great time. There's a lot of driving involved, especially as we asked to head back to Marrakech rather than Fez - but the sights along the way, the continuous information from Youssef and the stops for photos were just amazing. My favourite night was the first night in the budget Riad (very authentic and bit like staying at your Moroccan grandparent's house - very homely, warm and colourfully decorated). The view across the valley was just indescribable - it certainly didn't seem like a cheaper option. My friend's highlight was the following night in the desert. We rode camels in, had a go at sand boarding and then literally slept under the stars, before quad biking across the dunes the following morning. It appeared Youssef purposefully avoided tourist spots where possible, we asked to eat lunch in authentic places so that's where he took us and it seemed like we got to see some of the real Morocco. Three days together could push anyone's limits but the three of us didn't stop laughing and Youssef felt like a good friend rather than a tour guide. We were initially concerned about the price, but honestly, it was worth every penny. It's a lot to do/travel in 3 days which was fine for us but probably a bit too much for young kids so I would say do it over a longer time period.The only thing that could have made it any better would have been setting off on the camels maybe a bit earlier so we could have got more sandboarding in before dark.If you do anything in Morocco, do this tour! We have holiday blues from this excursion alone."

We have given this a 3 star as although we had a great day there were definitely a few problems.Pick up was on time and a good, new, comfortable car, the driver/guide (don't know if he was a guide or not) was good and very friendly.When we got to the waterfalls however he just pointed at a path and said follow that down to the waterfall, we followed this path which stopped and you had to go down the hill with no clear paths. We got lost for over an hour in the 40 degrees heat which was obviously not ideal, other people were with guides on their separate tours (they all weren't heading to the waterfall so we couldn't follow one) and it was hard for them to direct through these woods we were heading through. We eventually turned around and made it back to the start point and then headed down the hill on the other way \"the exit\" route from the waterfalls down the steps and past the shops.We eventually made it down and found our driver/(guide?) at the bottom waiting for us. We were not happy at this point however he redeemed the day by paying for our boat trip under the waterfall and also by reserving us, in or opinion, the best seat in the best cafe for our lunch.The waterfall was a great thing to say however it was Moroccan school holidays and it was full of kids jumping in the water which rendered the water a horrible brown colour at the bottom, we know from a family members previous trip that at different times of the year the water was very clear and attractive. This is not the tour operators fault though of course. We would have scored this a 5 had we not just been pointed in a direction and sent off on our own. This was not acceptable in our opinion."

Our guide, Youssef (also known as Jos\u00e9) was out of this world. We felt not just cared for but like we were truly friends. Our four-day, three-night tour took us through Dades Valley, Merzouga, the Sahara, and Ouzazarte. We were picked up from and delivered back to our Riad in Marrakech. We got to ride camels, have tons of tea with locals, go on an exciting hike through the gorge, chat with Berbers and learn some of the language, play with a ton of adorable babies (Youssef is the world's best baby playmate), get henna in a local home, and, of course, ride camels and watch sunrise and sunset over the sand dunes. But more important than all of these \"active adventures\" (harhar) was the sense of the \"authentic\" Morocco, which we got from visiting donkey parking, eating local dates, and most of all, talking with Youssef. He is a fount of information and is so passionate about his country and people. This sense of cultural exchange was exactly what we were looking for but hard to find in reviews - so if this is what you're seeking, a real dive into what Morocco means to Morrocans, then MAA is the place for you.The entire team went above and beyond in terms of caring for us. Some of the examples I won't even say because others should not expect them - we certainly didn't - but, for example, they helped out tremendously when we were having bank problems, catered generously and attentively to a gluten intolerance, and generally went above and beyond to make us feel safe and cared for. This adventure is what made Morocco and the whole trip for my friend and me. We would do it again a hundred times, and encourage you to do so! It's outstanding and worth it."

We enjoyed time riding the camels, traveling to the other side of the area, learning about local food and some interesting culture.We love the stories from Ali.Thank you all for arranging such a good trip."

            "review": "Amazing guided experience!. Since there were only 3 of us, we were very careful when choosing a tour guide for our first trip to Morocco. A friend recommended us Morocco Active Adventures, and, honestly, it was the best decision we made. Our tour guide was Joussef, and you could see he loves what he does; he was very kind and respectful. Throughout the trip he became our friend; for that, we are truly thankful. It was an amazing trip; the hotels where we stayed were beautiful, and the people who worked there were very amicable and provided a magnificent service. The night at the desert camp was unforgettable and the camel rides at sunset and sunrise indescribable. Joussef is fluent in five languages, including Spanish and English, which was a big plus for us. We recommend Morocco Active Adventures to everyone, it is worth the money and it leaves you wanting to go back.Morocco is a beautiful country!Thank you again for everything Joussef,Alexandra, Jose and Estefania"

Abdul was our guide for the day and arrived a bit late to pick us up at the hotel, mighty apologetic for the delay because he went to the wrong hotel by accident. Anyway, he was there and we got into his car for a fabulous, adventurous journey. Abdul is personable and an excellent guide. He took us to traditional Berber homes in the Atlas mountains for breakfast and lunch and is a treasure trove of history, pop culture, philosophy, religion and anything else you may be interested in about the local area. Since we come from a place famous for skiing, we wanted to see the ski resort in the Atlas mountains. This meant a detour for Abdul from the planned route, but he did it cheerfully. There was some snow there in May which excited the children. On the way back to the hotel, we also hired quad bikes for a trip through some rugged terrain. Once again, enjoyed by the family. By the end of the day, my boys got quite attached to Abdul and were sad that the trip had come to an end. I think that is a great testament to what a superb tour it was. I would definitely recommend Morocco Active Adventures for any type of tour. There is a good reason they have nearly 100 5 star reviews. They have earned every single one of them."

Not only did he do an amazing job during the tour, but he also made sure to take care of us after the tour was over. He took us to the airport during his free time, and even made a stop at McDonalds! We hope to remain good friends with him. As for the actual tour, it was UNBELIEVABLE! The long car rides were so much fun, as Jose made sure to make it interesting along the way. We stayed in a beautiful hotel the first night and then in tents in the Sahara the second night...the tents are more like hotel rooms! Jose and the other tour guides that were in the desert with us even made a cake for one of us who had a birthday that day. Needless to say, Jose and Morocco Active Adventures are definitely the best!"

My friends and I spent a day and a half in Marrakech before we were picked up by Youssef for our three day journey through the Atlas Mountains into the Sahara. The journey to the Sahara is not a short one, but Youssef somehow managed to make it feel that way with numerous entertaining stops along the way. I learned more than I ever could have imagined walking around and talking to Youssef about the different lifestyles that we encountered. Once we finally reached the desert, we quickly climbed atop our sweet camels and rode into the sunset. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed, and it was soon topped by the breathtaking sunrise we experienced the following morning. Our night spent camping out in the Sahara is one that I will never forget, many thanks to Morocco Active Adventures!"

We arranged for a 3-day private tour 5/19/15-5/21/15 starting out in Marrakech and dropping us off in Fez at the conclusion of our trip. We traveled through the High Atlas Mountains, the Todra Gorge, rode camels in the Sahara, slept in a beautiful tent out in the dessert, fed baby monkeys in cedar Forrest. It was an unforgettable experience and the highlight of our time in Morocco. We loved our tour guide Ali. He made us all feel special and took such great care of us the entire time. He was also very knowledgeable and took time to explain, inform and help us appreciate his country. I can't say enough good things about him! Thank you so much Ali! We were three women embarking on our first adventure in Morocco. Before we went we were nervous planning and thinking about things like personal safety and where we would go to the bathroom and how hot was it going to be in the dessert? We never had anything to fear. Our safety was never in question. Yes, there were bathroom stops along the way and they were always clean and what we were used to. In the dessert you had to pour water to flush the toilets but hey we were in the dessert and it was an incredible experience! The vehicle was comfortable and we had AC. The camel ride at dawn and sunset was timed for a perfect temperature outside and it was unforgettable, it helped me experience the magic of the Sahara. I have no words to describe it. It's something each person has to experience for themselves. Ali even helped arrange for a surprise birthday cake for me! It was so special. I will always remember my time in Morocco and can't wait to return. Shukran Ali and the great team at Morocco Active Adventures!"

I can't describe how much we enjoyed our trip, and have plans to return as soon as possible. Thank you so much."

We are a group of 4 women travellers from Hong Kong, and the 4d3n desert trip was the best we have ever had (among our experiences throughout Asia, Europe & America)! We did the trip from Marrakech to Fez, traveling in a comfortable 4x4 with nice local music & wifi (ssssh\u2026 don't tell others!) and seeing all the wonderful views of Atlas mountain, Sahara desert and above all, the unforgettable camel riding and camping under the starry sky. We were taken to a secret place for a nice picnic with amazing desert view, and we also visited berber village and nomads to know about the desert culture. They did not take you to shopping & no extra costs. Well, this maybe similar to other desert tours, but what stands out is the incredible guide & service provided by Morocco Active Adventure (MAA)!MAA was the fastest to reply my queries and I even managed to talk to them via online chat before confirming my booking! This gave me confidence on their experience and as a group of lady travellers from Asia to visit such an exotic country like Morocco, we truly value this ^v^!The guide, Youssef, is incredibly amazing, experienced and entertaining! He is knowledgeable in local culture and traditions, and makes you feel like a good old friend. You will be surprised by the talent he has got, and also find him a funny lad who shares silly jokes and full of wild ideas. We had met other travelers & their guides on our way, and we believed our experience was unique, awesome and the best! We wished we did a longer trip and spend more time in the desert!We visited in April 2013, and we are still in touch with MAA, sharing our traveling experience and others."

The transport was an air conditioned 4x4, very comfortable for the 2 of us and we felt super safe with our driver and his road etiquette. Lots of driving so was very important. Accom was 4/5star and extremely happy with them. All safe clean and very nice.Sites blew us away.. One minute dry arid land the next green valleys of bliss. I must mention or aim was to get to the desert and we were impressed by the scenery on the way.Desert was amazing - exactly what I expected, beautiful serene and peaceful. Our camel rides were an hour into the camp site one night stay and back on the camel the next morning. We luckyily shared a camp site with a bunch of fun and interesting English speaking tourists which made it even nicer! Now to our guide - if you can request anyone Youssef Bani was excellent. He is a wealth of knowledge, funny and energetic and didn't fail to deliver on any of our guided tour with him! He certainly made our tour more special!! Thank you to the team and most importantly to our guide.!! "

Even though the camels did hurt is an experience that should be tried at least once in your life... The night at the desert was one of the best part of the trip...

From Ait Ben Haddou, to the Toudgha Gorges, to the guest house in Ramlia (middle of no where!) to the camel trek for the overnight stay in the Sahara (where you can't help but sing that song by the Police in your head as you have some tea) to the Barbary Apes (monkeys) in the cedar forest of Azrou.

They greeted us with Moroccan tea, we had a full dinner and had a great tent to sleep in. After dinner the whole camp group learned how to play the drums around the campfire. Our guide took us up to the sand dunes and we got to see the beautiful stars. The next morning we went on a 45 minute camel ride and met up with our guide at the end of the ride. We road-tripped back to the city and on the way stopped by some of the sight-seeing places of Morocco. We got to stop by the place where they filmed Gladiator and even toured the city of that particular place. Our guide was phenomenal. He made us feel welcomed and even taught us Arabic! We learned so much from him and he answered any questions we had. The car that we drove in was plasted with music and he stopped whenever we wanted to take pictures. It was an amazing trip because my roommates and I were on a tight schedule and they were really flexible in the trip. They even set us up with an amazing riad the night before our flight. The riad was beautiful, accommodating and fed us delicious breakfast in the morning. We had a flight at 6am and the lady who lived/worked there woke up at 4am to make us breakfast. They were all so incredibly sweet. This trip was by far one of the best experiences I've had my semester abroad. We felt so safe and enjoyed every minute of this trip.

Five years ago we visited Morocco with our best friends and had a wonderful tour of the country which was arranged through a travel agency. We were particularly impressed with our driver, Fedli Mohamed, who not only delivered us safely to each destination, but also saw to our every need. We recently returned to Morocco. Before we left, we contacted Mohamed directly to see if he was still with the same company since it was important to us to secure his services. We found that he was now independent and could not only drive us but also make the complete trip arrangements for us. He planned the whole trip for us, securing lodging, hiring local guides and arranging site visits. We had every bit as fantastic a trip as we did the first time and it was roughly half the price. Mohamed is honest, dependable, and dedicated to serving his clients. He is based in Marrakesh and can either do day trips from there or can take you through the whole country. He picked us up and dropped us off at the Casablanca airport. We reached Mohamed at his email address fedlimohamed@gmail.com"

The places we stayed were all very nice. We particularly enjoyed staying in the Riads because they were beautiful and right in the historic areas. Our trip was sort of a loop around the central part of the country. We went to Rabat, Meknes, Fes, and then out to the desert. It was the best part of the trip. We spent a night in a tent camp out in the desert. Later we met some Berber Nomads, and we had tea with them. After the desert, we went to Essaouira, then to Marrakesh. Key Travel thought of everything to make our trip more enjoyable. All in all the best vacation experience we have ever had."

As a young, solo female traveller I was concerned about how safe it was for me to travel in Morocco, however that concern was no longer after discovering this brilliant tour company that offered all the experiences I wanted for my trip to Morocco from Australia - 4WD, desert camping, camels, sand boarding, quad bikes, local cuisine and cooking class, learning the language etc etc. It was more expensive than the group tours I originally looked at, but so so worth it - even just for the amazing accommodation you get to stay in!! And because it is a private tour you feel safe - my tour guide, Joussef, knows everyone there, and knows everything about the areas and towns you drive through, he taught me some arabic and berber language, and your itinerary is extremely flexible. On the first night he sat me down with a giant map and gave me five different itinerary alternatives, so I picked two and we kind of made it up as we went along, it was awesome! Plus we threw in a whole lot of 4WD river crossing, desert and dune drives spontaneously. A definite 5-star experience for anyone wanting an active-style adventure in Morocco!"

            "review": "Best Tour in Morocco. Earlier last month I booked a last minute trip to Spain along with two friends. While the planning unfolded we contemplated venturing south to Morocco. After booking a four day trip to Marrakech we were realized that if we were going down to Morocco we might as well go out to the Sahara and see the dunes right? Yes, that escalated quickly. It just so happens that from Marrakech the three mayor dune systems are 7.5 hours to Zagora and 10 hours to either Erg Chigaga or Erg Chebbi (BEST DUNES in terms of size, vastness and greatness). At first we were a little skeptical about spending 20 hours driving back and forth from the desert in a four day/3 night trip but \"when in Rome...\" Well we found out that most excursion companies that we contacted refused to take us since we wanted to do to much in too little time. Marrakech Tour Excursions was one of the few that were willing to take us out. This good initial impression never faded away proved to be accurate. From the pick up to the drop off back our driver, Hamid, was very professional, friendly and knowledgeable. We were picked up from Hostel Riad Marrakech Rouge in a very comfortable and I would say upscale Toyota Prado SUV. The added comfort of the personalized tour and the vehicle made the long drive something truly enjoyable. Between the conversations with Hamid and sightseeing from Marrakech to the desert the ride was well worth it. During the ride out you get to see changes in landscape from dry Marrakech to deciduous forest a you go up the Atlas Mountains up to the snow-covered peaks and back down eventually passing Ouarzazate (Moroccan Hollywood) and from there dissecting painteresque towns all the way to the desert. Once we arrived to Erg Chebbi we had the camels, or dromedaries as we learned is the proper name for the one-humped Saharan camel, and our desert guide Said waiting for us ready to go. We got out there just in time for the sunset as we trekked our way out to the Berber camp. Upon arriving I was favorably surprised by the facilities at the camp. The camp consists of a series of huts lined up one next to the other in typical Berber fashion. They even have a restroom set up out there in the desert! That night Said cooked for us the best tagine (chicken) which we had during the whole trip. After supper we went off to build a fireplace and Said played the tbe and bendir (berber drums) and chanted traditional folkloric music of the region. Next morning we we up before sunrise to see the sunrise above the sea of dunes. Once up we were left free to roam the surrounding dunes and sandboard our way to exhaustion. After this we camel trekked our way back to Merzouga while contemplating the vastness and perfectly shaped dunes. Once back at the town Said took us to the Hotel where we had a very good and filling breakfast followed by a shower before heading back to Marrakech. All in all if you can't judge by my experienceI am HIGHLY recommending going out to the desert and Marrakech Tour Excursions made this all possible for us. This is a great opportunity to witness the greatness of nature and immerse themselves in a completely foreign culture. This is why along with the great treatment we were given I would strongly suggest you contact them if you are contemplating any trip around Marrakech. Even if you are not going out to the desert they offer different tours like the Tour of the Imperial Cities in which they take you around different cities in northern Morocco. I cannot emphasize this enough, they are professional, amiable and easily approachable. If I were to go again I would definitely contact them."

We contacted Joussef and he arranged a custom trip that was perfect for our needs (2 days/1 night from Marrakech to Merzouga/Erg Chebbi). Hamid, our experienced driver, picked us up early in the morning in a very comfortable air-conditioned 4x4. We arrived at the desert just before sunset and took a camel ride into the Erg Chebbi Dunes for approximately 1 hour. We spent the night in a traditional berber camp, where Said, our friendly host, prepared some traditional tajine for us. The next day we had a great time sandboarding. The price for the tour was very reasonable. I highly recommend M.T.E. to everyone."

We contacted Youssef about a trip from Fes to Marrakech and he arranged a wonderful itinerary. In particular, our guide Omar was excellent; he had a great eye for sights and obviously knew the area extremely well. As we learned, he grew up in the region where we traveled, and his love for the area really shone through during our trip. He showed us local schools and businesses they were helping to support, and it was really touching to see him and Youssef giving back so much to the Berber communities where they grew up. We spent a night out in Berber tents in the Sahara, another night far off the beaten track in the desert (after a day of off-roading), and a third night in the Dades Valley. Our driver was excellent as well; never once did I feel like we were unsafe or out-of-control, even though we drove nearly 100km through the desert with no roads in sight.The price of the trip was incredibly reasonable -- much cheaper than if we had tried to book individual hotels and travel. More importantly, the company and the guide treated us like family, helping us bargain, recommending local specialties, and sharing stories from their own lives and experiences. No one ever pushed us to buy anything, unlike the guides in Fes and Marrakech. I will certainly be recommending this company to everyone I know traveling to Morocco. One note: the desert areas we visited get quite cold in January, so bring warm clothes!"

It feels like going on a road trip with a good friend - he really went out of his way to make sure our journey felt easy, effortless and personal. Originally from a Berber village in the desert we were exploring, Joussef introduced us to his mother, brothers, and extended network of Aunties. We were invited to have lunch and tea with them, a wonderful glimpse into Berber life. His mom even made us a special drink to try to help calm our rumbly tummies. Joussef's English is excellent, and he was able to answer even our most obscure questions, point out things we could never get from a guide book (try and learn the special hand signal for Berber independence!) and introduced to some pretty amazing contemporary African music (a must for a long, desert road trip). Part of the trip was spent off-roading into the desert, where we really felt like we were the only people for miles and miles. It was a special treat to get to fully experience the silence and remoteness of the landscape. Riding the camels was delightful, and not just some posed picture - we must have ridden the camels for an hour at sunset into the Erg Chebbi, the magnificent dunes of the Sahara. Not once were we pushed to buy anything - a huge relief from the tour guides in the cities. We highly recommend M.T.E. and Joussef for a really personal POV of Morocco."

Our guide Sa'ad (not sure the spelling is spot on!!) was funny and informative. Along the journey to the waterfalls, passing spectacular views, he told us lots of interesting facts about the mountains, Berber culture and gladly answered any questions we had. Sa'ad took us for a little optional off-roading which made our palms sweat!! But, it was fun and he was a great driver even in windy steep parts of the journey. The waterfall itself was nice, but, as it's the height of summer, the water was a little low. We had lunch in a restaurant that the company use regularly and it was fine. There were tables where we could dangle our feet in the river, if we so wished, to relieve ourselves of the heat. Our only regret was not booking a 3 day tour into the desert particularly if we'd had the same guide, as he was great. Thank you for wonderful day. Well worth the money!!"

            "review": "Efficient, tour was exactly as described.. We did a day tour out to the Ouzoud waterfalls. The driver and guide were ten minutes early, and then we were off. It was really worthwhile to have a private tour, and to have something organised from this end before you go. (Youseff is very good at getting back to you by email to organise it all before you set off). I paid a deposit by Paypal, and paid the rest at the end of the tour. Nice and simple. Dirhams or Euros are fine.The trip is long, but definitely worth it when you get there. We trekked about, had something to eat, and then when we were done, we found them and we could go back home. SO nice not to have to wait for a busload of lemmings to finish.Our guide Ismail was very chatty and taught us a lot about how Rammadan works and the Berber people. On the way back I think we all dozed a bit (apart from the driver!!). We could stop to take some pcitures of things that grabbed us on our way (so a cattle bartering market, or a french fortress). Nothing was too much trouble. Ismail's English was excellent.The driver didnt speak much English but he seemed obliging enough. It might be pricier than arranging a cab to take you there and back, or to do a bigger tour group. For us, though, this was totally worth it."

            "review": "Best Travel Experience in Morocco. Merzougha is roughly a 7-8 hour drive from Fes through the Mid and High Atlas Mountains. It is the best way to see large sand dunes. You arrive and then take a 1-1.5 hour camel ride into the dunes. Many choose to overnight in the dunes with an organized tour. Many options are available from many of the local hotels in and around the area. It is possible to have part of your group stay in a hotel and part of your group spend the night in the dunes. We have arranged and sent many groups to Merzougha and many say they prefer to stay one extra day in the large dunes. You can climb the dunes, snowboard down the dunes. The best time to go is April/May. The summer time gets too hot. Groups find it comfortable to do an overnight in during December and Jan. It is worth mentioning that this is a longer drive from Marrakech and cannot be reached in one day. You can visit small dunes in a city called Zagora which is about a 7 hour drive from Marrakech, yet the dunes there are not even in the same category as the ones in Merzougha."

We all then saw the sunrise and it was a moment that I will never forget. You learn about the culture of the desert and just embrace the peacefulness of standing in a sea of sand. -Amazing!"

Our guide's name was Youssef and he was awesome! He met is in Marrakech, and from there we began an amazing three day adventure. A beautiful hotel on the first night, a night in the desert on the second, and on the third day we ended up in Fes. I seriously wish we could have done more time in the desert. I can't describe the amazing views, the amazing experience, it was truly unforgettable.I loved our off-road adventures, and our drives through various Berber villages. It's something that you truly have to experience at least once in your life.Make sure that you get Youssef and his driver (forgot his name.....yikes) for this. Truly worth the money!"

We booked a 4-day tour from a group of 3 young professionals from Fes to Marrakech, and it was by far the best part of our month-long travel in Southern Europe and North Africa. Our guide Joussef was a very friendly and knowledgeable host, with a comfortable Landcruiser that took us to the depths of the desert & close contact with the local Berber culture. Definitely recommended for travellers who want to check out the desert - couldn't have been a better experience!"

With these gentlemen we felt so safe and provided us with all answers of our many questions because we were really excited by the local culture of amazir people. Besides, the SUV was very comfortable with AC which really gave us a release from the burning heat. If you are heading to Morocco don't hesitate to book with MTE team.

We traveled around very cool sights around Morocco like the Atlas Mountains, beautiful gorges, and finally the Sahara. The night at the desert was the best part of the trip. We traveled to an oasis on dromedaries, ate typical moroccan tangine, climbed to one of the tallest dunes in Morocco, and slept under the stars. Youssef and the crew were very nice and helpful throughout the trip and they took us to good restaurants and good hotels. I would recommend this experience to anyone."
