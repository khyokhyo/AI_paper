The temple itself it's big and can imporess everyone. The only drawback of the place is the fact, that there are a lot of rubbish and monkeys (yes!) which can attack you! yes! be careful with coca-cola bottle - hide everything, as monkeys love cola and they can jump on you to steal one....In general - must see place when you are in Kathmandu!"

We came back from our Everest base camp trek and wanted to go to a couple of temples and chose this one (monkey) and durbar square (patan) as our two we wanted to sample. Regarding this temple essentially there's a couple hundred steps to climb which is where you'll find most of the monkeys, be careful as we came across one who didn't seem to want to let us pass and came quite aggressive, so if your taking young children bear in mind that they are wild animals and are unpredictable in nature. Once at the top you have a gold stupa with various temple elements surrounding. What I found disappointing was the amount of people trying to sell you things in and around the temple... This is one of the first temples I've visited in any Asian country which actually had people trying to sell within the temple grounds, I understand it's a poor country and people go where the tourists go to make an opportunistic sale, but kind of took the magic away for me. In the time it took to climb the stairs, have a look around the stupa and then a wander round the other side and reach the car park on the other side you need no longer than 1 hour to do this temple."

Interesting. But the shape of the religious icons and the dirtiness and dinginess of the entire place detracted from the experience. We have seem many religious icons and temples in Myanmar that are so much better cared for - it's sad that this religious place isn't cleaner. We enjoyed the monkeys and the fountain for world peace.

Beware of monkeys - as soon as we arrived they snatched a packet of baby wipes from our bag which was a funny experience. A short climb up the stairs will take you to the main stupa. You can go around it spinning the prayer wheels which is said to bring good luck. You will get great panoramic views of the Kathmandu city below. We found 2 sets of stairs, the one we took was easy. The other one we found was very steep and would have been considerably harder to climb up."

On any visit to Kathmandu, be sure to set aside some time for this temple."

The climb up here steps to the temple itself WAS a challenge, but all the more satisfying to reach the summit at the end. Bring your water - you'll need. It during and after climb's end.

Great views of the city and a very enlightening experience on Buddhism. Monkeys are everywhere, so keep food hidden away otherwise you'll get mugged; one even nicked our map the cheeky git. Best part of the experience was heading into a shop opposite an alley where 'Cafe (something)' Is written on the wall. We met a lovely shop owner who practices meditation and he gave us an in-depth lecture on singing bowls; how they help you relax and cleanse your chakras. My girlfriend and I both left feeling super chilled after he made us both sit and listen binaurally to the sounds. As a musician, I found this really interesting and ended up buying one bowl off him. Only downside is that, with it being a tourist hotspot, there are plenty of stalls trying to sell you gifts and there were a few young (children) beggars, which was slightly distracting from the whole 'spiritual' experience. Had a lovely time overall though!"

The view you get when you climb the steep stairs is just priceless.Secondly, the story of how it originates. Do read it beforehand so you can understand the significance of this place. It is one of my favourite.Thirdly, this place is full of tantrism. The stories are too tempting not to read. There is one old building next to the stupa itself which houses various tantric scriptures and other one nearby where it is believed that a tantric is still meditating after hundreds of years. Both the places are closed for public.Lastly, the reconstructions are still going on after the 2015 earthquake but that won't be an issue. It is full of visitors everyday. If you go there on a clear sunny day, then you get a good view of KAthmandu valley from the top.(A must see view)."

I grew up playing around the temple.There are hundred of legacies, manuscripts and scriptures written about how settlement started in Kathmandu valley. One as such is associated with Swoyambhu Nath stupa. It is said that Kathmandu used to be a lake(daha). When the lake water receded from the gorge, there was a shrine around a lotus which is where Swoyambhu nath is today. This is one of the most heard stories while growing up.It is also believed that there is \"astu\" of Gautam Buddha in the stupa.You can have a 360 degree view of the Kathmandu Valley from the stupa.But as a resident, I find the mornings and evenings, very blissful. Early morning, you will find young, old, male, females everyone walking. Irrespective of your religious faith, if you are a Nepali and a resident nearby, you would walk around. You would pray. The evenings are cheerful around the stupa. We spend a lot of time, meeting friends over a cup of tea."

You can walk 30 min from Thamel and drive to foot hill from all major places. There is 365 steps (which represents 365 days of our life) to climb. Every day in the morning before dawn hundreds of Buddhist and Hindu pilgrims ascend those steps from this eastern side to the hill and past the gilded Vajra (The Thunderbolt) and two lions guarding the entrance, and begin a series of clockwise circumambulations of the main stupa. From the Swayambhunath is the best view of the entire Kathmandu valley and some Himalaya range. There are various temples and shrines around the main stupa. Though it is Buddhist temple both Hindu and Buddhists worship there.You can explore local lifestyle, culture and tradition on the way."

If you look somewhat foreign, they will pull you out of the queue and take you to the ticket booth. Even though its displayed that everyone has to pay, they will only let foreigners pay, which is completely wrong (but seems to be the standard in Kathmandu valley) Oh, on a side note, while I was paying for my ticket, a ton of other tourists managed to get in for free. This randomness is just annoying.-There are a lot of vendors at the stupa, and they are very very persistentIf it wasn't for these issues I'd rate this place higher, because its probably one of the coolest places in Kathmandu to visit."

The stupa and monasteries suffered a lot from the 2015 earthquake, but by now most has been rebuild. So to support the Tibetan community who lives on the Swayambhu hill, it's very helpful to bring a visit to this beautiful area."

You can ask the driver, if you rent a private car or taxi, to take you to the back gate and walk up the paved walkway for 5 minutes to reach the temple. Up on the hill, this second holiest Buddhist temple (after Boudhanath) provided awesome view of the city and was loaded with locals performing religious rituals. It's a big complex rich with activities. The large white stupa with gold ornament on top was surrounded by lots of smaller shrines. You can also find souvenir shops, stalls, restaurants, museum, library, etc. Spent a few hours strolling around and took pictures (Apr. 2015)."

The temple is among one of the UNESCO World Heritage site and its surroundings are said to be home to hundreds of monkeys, considered holy by believers. Many of Swayambhunath\u2019s structures suffered considerable damage in the earthquake and the aftershock of April 2015. The Anantapura shikhara to the left of the steps toppled and there was serious damage to buildings on the west side of the Stupa. We hired a private vehicle to reach Swayambhunath Stupa Temple, which also took us to the top of the monkey temple. But, the most beautiful way to reach the top of this temple is to climb the 365 stairs of the temple. That\u2019s assuming that you are either in excellent shape or you are young!

Very nice attraction but the monkeys make it unique. Tips to feed them: buy cookies from the first souvenir shop on the right as you get in to the attraction. A small package of cookies it cost, 50 Nepal rupees ($0.46). Do not have any sunglasses in your head or any hat etc. they will take it. Do not see in the eye - no eye contact, the monkeys that they carry babies with them. If you give them cookies, one by one and don't make the eye contact, it\u2019s safe 100%. Do not give them the half package and try to save-hide the other. They will follow you and maybe they will attack on you to take it. Give them one by one, some of them they will wait to get 3-4 pieces and then they will leave. When the package it\u2019s done, show them your hand, that is empty and you don't have any other cookies, they will leave :)"

There are many merchants and vendors at the top of the temple and near the entrances, who offer good prices for souvenirs and trinkets, and if you have gifts to buy, this is a good place to do it. Be aware of the monkeys - they are mostly calm, but not necessarily friendly, and will become aggressive if you try to pet them or get to close, especially to the baby monkeys. Also be aware of your possessions particularly food or drink bottles, as the monkeys WILL try to steal from you - often successfully."

The \"monkey temple\" deserves its English nickname- starting at the base, there are monkeys everywhere. It is best not to bring any food or drinks- these bold monkeys will attack if you have something they want. One friend wasn't gripping his soda bottle tightly enough, and a monkey pulled it out of his hands and bit through the plastic to get a drink. My husband had a monkey climbing up his legs and grabbing him trying to steal a water bottle. Monkeys aside, also beware of the many touts crawling all over the base and steps, who will try trick you into paying for a tour. If you can avoid these two hazards, it's worth the walk up the hundred of steps to see the beautiful stupa. There is earthquake damage, but also a lot of repair work being done. If a yellow haze of pollution wasn't permanently hanging over Kathmandu, there would probably be nice views over the city. This site costs about Rs.800 LESS than walking through Durbar Square and is far more beautiful and interesting."

The area is wide spread, you can enjoy the beautiful view over Kathmandu and surely spend more then one and a half hours there!I've been there 2 times and I still think it's a lovely place to visit even more than once."

As other reviewers have noted, if you don't feel like the long walk up the many steps, you can get quite close to the top via a road. I can see why others mention that it feels a little too commercial with street vendors, but I just enjoyed wandering around looking at the variety of architectural styles.

There are more guides at the top vying for your business and if you are interested in the history of the place it would be worth getting one.

At the top the configuration and aesthetic appeal of the main structure is certainly entrancing. But more than this it is the reverence and homage paid by most of the visitors that really makes it. It is not just a place for tourists, although by the amount of tourist goods being sold around it, you could be mistaken. One note however, we went in April just before the monsoon and the pollution in the air was truely unbelievable making what should have been amazing views, virtually impossible.

Our guide dubbed it the \"Monkey Temple\"You can buy coins for cheap and toss them into the fountain for good luck. Worth doing for the local touch!"

As indicated by Buddhist legend, a solitary flawless lotus developed in the focal point of the lake. At the point when the bodhisattva Manjusri depleted the lake with a slice of his sword, the lotus bloom settled on top of the slope and mysteriously changed into the stupa. Hence it is known as the Self-Created (swayambhu) Stupa. The most punctual composed record of the Swayambunath Stupa's presence is a fifth century stone engraving, yet researchers accept there was likely a hallowed place here as ahead of schedule as the first century. Indeed, even before that, it is likely that animist customs occurred on this slope. Swayambunath is one of Nepal's most seasoned Buddhist sanctuaries and it has an antiquated environment, particularly when one methodologies by walking with the pioneers."

The stairs themselves are lined with many small vendors selling stone carvings, beadwork, and signing bowls. Its always very crowded at the top and the smell of butter lamps hangs very heavy in the air. The stuppas itself remains intact after the earthquake and is one of the most magnificent ones I've seen in Nepal. The views from here would be very nice if you could see through the haze.

There's the occasional ringing of a bell, a bit of chanting but apart from it might as well have been a fair ground attraction. To top it all my favorite restaurant with a roof top view lies in ruins (earthquake damage).  Saying all this. If it's your first visit to Kathmandu it's worth dropping by. On a clear day the view is excellent - the climb up the approach stairs and all the monkeys are an experience in themselves and it's cheap to get in.

What I very much enjoyed there was simply finding a nice spot to sit and watch all that is happening around. It is sometimes the best way to absord the atmosphere of a place and definitely worked for me in this case too, with om mani padme hum running at the background from a near-by shop. Definitely a must visit place in Kathmandu, in my opinion. We walked up through the foresty path and walked down the steep stairs, which is a nice change to the general route. The foresty path can be entered from the side of the stupa and is a nice walk up, with tons of monkeys running around. Shortly before the stupa, there's another square with a number of nice things to see and do around. From there, you can ascend to the stupa and after seeing around it, descend from the stairs."

Large crowds of locals rise the many steps early morning to pay respect and worship and is a critical part of everyday life and was very interesting to witness first hand.As with most of the major sights, some of the buildings are badly damaged from the earthquake and a few touts are about offering guide services and the like.Finally a word of warning, make sure you are prepared to climb the steps and work out a bit of sweat as it is hard enough work."

Historical records found on a stone inscription give evidence that the stupa was already an important Buddhist pilgrimage destination by the 5th century AD. Its origins however, date to a much earlier time, long before the arrival of Buddhism into the valley. This is one of the world\u2019s most glorious Buddhist Stupa. Painted on the four sides of the spire bases are the all seeing eyes of Lord Buddha. Swayambhu has two small Tibetan Gumbas with typical colorful shrines open to all visitors."

The higher u go, the more u feel peaceful. Added advantage is that u can see almost whole valley from the top, going is not difficult. You can rest anywhere u feel comfortable.

An honest place to buy paintings. There are many other stalls selling innumerable statues. It was worth remembering that almost everything made in Nepal is handmade, from the most simple memento to the more elaborate pieces.

It's on the hillside so you get a nice view of the valley. I've gone during sunset and it was nice, and the night view with all the lights is nice too. One cool thing was I got to see when a group/area went into load shedding and see that entire area black out while another area lit up. During the day it is also nice to see the surrounding hills and buildings. If you're lucky (maybe 3 days or so a month) it's clear enough that you can see the Himalayas to the east. But usually it's too smoggy, foggy, dirty, hazy. Reason 2 - the monkeys. They're so funny and cute. I don't feed them, but they are nice when you leave them alone and you can get good pictures of them perched everywhere. Reason 3 - the shopping. Most places around Kathmandu don't have these kinds of little stands selling trinkets and souvenirs. These sellers are very reasonably priced and there is a good variety. Almost every stand I visited had different designs in jewelry, unlike Thamel or Durbar Square where everyone has the same stuff. Reason 4 - All the different structures at the base and the top of the stupa. At the base there is the fountain with the gold stature and miniature stupas with the gold top and eyes. There is also the large temple bell and gate. Then at the top there are the lookout towers (unfortunately one crumbled during the earthquake) and the main large stupa. The gold top and eyes are still intact and when the sun hits it, it is amazing. They are known as the \"eyes of Nepal\" and for good reason. The surrounding older buildings with the original wood carved windows and brick walls are also a nice contrast to the newer concrete buildings that surround the Boudhanath Stupa. This place is well worth the 200 rupees to visit."

The stairs are a steep climb but well worth it at the top with great views over the valley and a fascinating temple to explore. Theres a charge at the top of the stairs, only a pound or two.

I visited this site in Feb. during the low tourist season but this place was jam packed. Come early if you don't like huge crowds, and be prepared to walk. You can have a driver take you further up so you don't have to walk up the stairs. They do have bathrooms near the entrance (the \"attendants\" will expect you to leave a tip).

Best attraction in Kathmandu in my opinion, Way better than the durbar square, and the guides selling their tours were far less annoying up here.Possibley a little tricky to find, I missed the main entrance which is quite spectacular, up the long flight of steps, and came in round a back way, Where I also seemed to miss the Ticket selling gate which kinda saved me 1000 Roupees, sorry! I just kind of wandered in and didn't realise you had to pay untill I saw the tickets on the way out! I found it fairly interesting, and you get some great Views over the city. change some money for coins and you can have a go at chucking it into the pond with a budda statue in the middle, I think you got good luck if you landed it at the buddas feet. I missed which totally explained the bad luck I received the next day when my flight to lukla got cancelled and I had to wait 9 hours in the airport to find out! Should have thrown more pennies ;)There really are loads of monkeys, I'd be a little wary of them though one of my mates got bit by a monkey in Thailand and had to have rabies shots!Go here over Durbar square ;)"

It is situated on a hill and this beautiful temple is visible from miles away. I suggest to visit it in the evening before the sunset. You can see Kathmandu city from up above. There are 300 + steps to the hill if you prefer to walk up or you can take your bike/car up the hill too. This place is very peaceful. A must visit if you are in Kathmandu."

We had an independent guide with driver and although this was a cost, if you can afford it, it was worth it for the interesting narrative he provided, as well as making the whole day go smoothly. We went in the morning when everything was just getting underway so the place was a hive of activity. The monkeys though were calm and we didn't feel threatened that they may jump on us. There were also lots of street dogs, but again, peaceful. The central steps are very steep.but others less so. It is one of the must-see places in Kathmandu and well worth the time and money."

People say Buddha visited this place thousands years ago. i grew up in a devoted Buddhist family, even though I am shy to say I'm a devoted Buddhist myself, I love the feeling of being so close to God, i feel peaceful. I met a couple of tourists who are from China, they told me that Nepal is the place which is very close to haven and God. I think that's why i didn't feel unsafe for some reasons. And the Nepalese are all look very genuine people and kind. Seems like they will never had ulterior motive. I would love to come back again, Swayambhunath, i love it. And mind you, a lot of steps to climb! Good exercise for me, again I love it"

The Monkey Temple has not so many monkeys but maybe it was called that because of the presence of a few human friendly monkeys there who are accustomed to tourists offering them food to eat. The temple has many small structures/tombs separated from each other, though in the same vast courtyard. Most structure represent traditional Nepalese architecture and bear fine cravings on stone. You will find many of the tombs and doors of many structures made of gold. Well, in ancient days it was real gold but it is reduced to gold plating now. You can see almost whole of Kathmandu from the top. It's a beautiful view.There are many tourist shops that sell attractive local souvenirs from Nepal \u2013 paintings, singing bowls, healing bowls, chants, and several brass items representing various mythological gods. You will find a lot of Buddha statues available in many materials \u2013 stone, wood, brass, etc. I was fascinated by the big brass bowls (actually they are not just made of brass \u2013 they are a mixture of brass and copper). There are two kinds \u2013 hand made and machine made. You can clearly make out the difference. The machine made ones are close to perfection in the physical form. The handmade ones don\u2019t have such fine finishing but the difference lies between the powers contained in both. The machine made ones don\u2019t produce so much of resonating singing sound as the handmade ones do. I am told the bowls have many uses \u2013 first and foremost of them being healing. Migraines, back-pains, blood pressure, etc. are common diseases that can be cured by using the bows in different ways. The technique lies in producing the sound vibrations and massaging the painful area with the vibrating bowl. If you pour some water in the bowl and produce the sound with the drumstick, the water starts to jump inside the bowl in a very mystic way and those drops carry huge amount of healing power for eyes and face. Well, I bought one bowl and am very excited about it. You can typically bargain up to 30-40% depending upon your need to buy, the shopkeeper\u2019s need to sell and your negotiation skills."

This temple to me was the perfect dilemma (mish-mash) of the Hindu and Buddhist faiths that coexist in Nepal. The Nepalis have managed to somehow merge both these influences in this one temple. At first glance, I did not know if I was visiting a Hindu temple or a Buddhist one! The peace eyes at the entrance of the steps to the temple are quite mesmerizing. But the same set of eyes again greet you at the top of the stairs (where the actual temple is). The stairs are not too difficult to climb. There is an entrance fee (less for SAARC citizens and slightly more for non-SAARC ones).There are plenty of hawkers selling knick-knacks and souvenirs on the stairs to the temple. Lots and lots of monkeys in the main temple area. Too many pigeons for my liking and a couple of dogs thrown in too! The prayers wheels encircle the stupa and it is really calming to turn them. We did see many brave-hearts climbing up from the other set of stairs (too many and too tiring!), which looked very steep, to the temple. Avoid those and just ask your car/taxi to drop you to the main temple area, from where it is just a few steps up. The views of the valley are the best from here. The whole of Kathmandu at the bottom, with prayer flags fluttering in the foreground! Make sure you pray for clear skies though!"

One visits Kathmandu expecting some kind of revelation. What the city does reveal is that the abject poverty that leaks from the city has also fashioned a way of survival for the people who call the city home. Meaning: at many of the religious sites, including this one, the trip is partially spiritual reflection and capitalist intervention. The hundreds of steps up to this stupa can take your breath away. At almost the very top, a man will ask you to pay the admission fee (a NPR 200 for foreigners, 50 NPR for locals). Not a bad idea. It goes to paying for the heritage preservation. Then at the top, you are greated by a gorgeous looking stupa that is no longer made of gold (but used to be). And many dozens of naughty little monkeys who make a game of stealing chapati and crisps from the hands of children, some of whom are brought by their parents to have a family picnic at the top of the hill.The monkeys can be quite entertaining, but I couldn't help but think that they brought a sense of poor hygeine to the place.Then there are the familes coming to the small temples around the stupa for blessings and puja. Very interesting to watch, as they are laced with flowers and given doti of vermillion and red on their foreheads. And lastly I remember the vendors asking if I wanted to buy a Buddha statue. I did. But the price they asked for even the smallest copper / bronze statues (US$45) made me choke with derision and surprise. Nepal has faced a lot in the wake of the two powerful earthquakes, and it is to be expected that people want to improve their lives. I just wish there was a better way other than selling artifacts that are really not genuine artifacts. But is there a better way?Please visit."

We had an unpleasant encounter with the ticket agent who ended up getting 500 NRs for two of us and then accused us of not paying and refused to give us tickets. Fortunately, you do not need the paper tickets (no one at the temple grounds asked to inspect that we had paid admission). After that unpleasantness, everything else about the visit to Swayambhunath Temple was nice. I knew there were monkeys around but I was still surprised at the number of them. It's particularly intimidating when they move --very fast--as a group. There were also lots of pigeons and a few dogs and puppy. The views of Kathmandu from the temple are spectacular. I was sad to see many structures still suffering from earthquake damage. I know there are ways to evade paying the admission fee (probably why the ticket agent was grumpy and accusatory), but please pay it. Hopefully it will help with paying towards repairing the earthquake damage."

Also depends on the actual weather and smog (during my visit it was very smoggy/foggy). This site was affected by earthquake a lot, however in December 2015 was fully accessible with no restrictions and it's partially renowed.Be prepared for local residents - monkeys. They are literally everywhere. I was a bit scared first, bud they are domesticated and \"respectful\", so no need to worry about your personal items (if it's not food sticking out from your bag). There is also a small entrance fee - 200 rupees, a way less than in Durbar Square or Pashupatinath (1000 npr each)."

If heading for sunrise, it can be very dark, so walking the streets take a touch.Swayambhunath is a local place to go to exercise in the morning, so be prepared to share your view with the odd press up and monkey in front of you.Best tip - Get there before 6:30am and you don't have to pay the 200 rupees.After the earthquake it's clear what damage was caused and it's awful to see so many buildings destroyed! Be careful when walking around as there are a number of \"danger zones\" Good news if you go past the stupa and turn right down a side path, there are public toilets. Which is a nice change to other places on Kathmandu.Strongly recommend a visit but if you are not prepared to do the climb you can always take the back road and get a taxi! "

Quite \"sprawling & spacious\" grounds on not one, but TWO levels (don't have to go too many steps from the middle level to the top though) are what await you at this temple on top of the hill by the same name, and the best advice I can give when it comes to this temple is to go up from the back side with \"easier\" steps leading to the middle level where I suggest you spend half an hour to an hour, starting from the two white stupas and the little pond with a standing Buddha in the middle to the back area where there's a rectangular-shaped structure with small dharma wheels around it and a two-story red temple with lion statues at its gate, before going up to the top where the main stupa is. There are also great views of the city below from near the red temple (mentioned above), but the views may be somewhat obscured by trees there, and yes do keep an eye on the monkeys and don't go too close to them (I encountered quite aggressive ones!).And the way I did after the middle level (after coming back to the front side of the middle level from the red temple at the back) to get to the top is taking the steps on the left side which took me: firstly to the back area of the top with a big golden-and-red Buddha and two-or-three-story brick buildings on three sides selling miscellaneous religious items like strings of beads, statuettes and masks; secondly to the more spacious courtyard-like area surrounded on all four sides by similar brick buildings selling similar items as at the back area; and finally to the main stupa at the open area on the left after passing through these miniature tower-shaped & cone-shaped structures on the part of the temple grounds near the Stupa (those structures are actually scattered all over the temple grounds on both levels, but there's a big cluster of them near the Stupa). Also be sure to take in the absolutely \"spectacular\" view of the city below and the surrounding mountains of the Kathmandu Valley from the lookout area just past the Stupa where you might also see some people burning things in small cups or something for maybe some religious reason. The front side which is the side most tourists use (and where the main parking area is) will bypass the middle level and take you straight up to the top (you could go down to the middle level from the top though, kind of opposite to the way I did with the middle level first coming up the hill from the back), but it will be a \"much more\" arduous way compared to going up from the back side to the middle level first. The only things worthwhile to use the steps on the front side are these two pretty identical sets of three golden-and-red Buddhas along the way up (the first set pretty close to the bottom of the hill, the second one a bit higher up), but you could check out those Buddhas on the front-side steps AFTER coming down the hill from the back side (the same way as going up) and walking around or getting your cab to drive around to the front.From Thamel, it's just about a half-hour walk west to get here (have to walk around about another 15 minutes though to get to the steps on the back side), so a cab is just optional which will only be like a ten-minute ride (ask the driver to take you to the back if you want to go up the way I did). I didn't walk here though, actually did a combo tour that day (arranged at my hotel) starting from Thamel to Bodhnath first, then to Buddhanilkantha and finally to this one before returning to Thamel costing 3,000 Nepalese rupees (about US$30), which was a good deal since there seemed no other option to get to those two other places (Bodhnath & Buddhanilkantha) quite distant from the heart of the city (where Thamel is)."

Please visit this iconic landmark and as we did leave a donation at the tented donation desk, you will receive a receipt and monies raised will bring this Stupa back to its forma glory"

It is perched high on a hill in Kathmandu with spectacular views to the city and surrounds below. There are many different things to experience there including a Thanka art school where you can learn about this intricate style of religious art. Be careful of the cheeky monkeys that will try and steal any treats such as fresh coconut you might buy while visiting the temple."

You walk up many steps to different levels where myriad shrines are dotted around the place and after the first climb of steps you'll find that the noise and chaos of Kathmandu has some how disappeared. You will need to walk several flights of steps before you get to the top so take a bottle of water on those hot days; you'll need it.The temple complex at the top was very sadly damaged due to the earthquake, but damage aside I wanted to go, and felt that this holy place still kept its atmosphere. the views from the top are incredible. The temple complex is bigger than it initially seems to give yourself time to talk around - I spent half a day up there, just strolling and find a shaded spot here and there to sit and soak up this place. If only in its small measure does my payment contribute to the restoration of this place then I am please to pay. I donated too because the world would be diminished if Nepal's places of wonder were not restored back to their pre-earthquake condition."

When I learnt about a major quake in Kathmandu in April 2015, I was worried about this ancient monument. So, I was very curious to visit this place again when I went here in September 2015. Glad to see that the main structure is standing tall, in tact, with negligible damage. Some surrounding temple buildings did suffer a lot and are in different stages of renovation.One has to walk between 20 and 40 minutes in two directions to reach the main stupa. It is quite a steep ascent and elderly people find it not very easy to reach the top. The road to top has many monkeys snatching food articles from the hands of the tourists. There are many hawkers lining both sides of the roads to sell small mementos and typical touristic things.Once on top, one can really have a \"bird's eye view\" of the whole Kathmandu city. Small temples around showcase coexistence of two religions - Hinduism and Buddhism side by side, peacefully. It is a beautiful spot for photography. Buddha's eyes painted here are symbol of Nepal tourism and easily identifiable everywhere. This is a scenic spot worth a couple of hours at least. If you have enough time to spare, it is worth even half a day. But do remember, it is tiring at the end of the day."

Without getting too lost in the narrow, curving streets, I walked from my hotel in Thamel, Kathmandu to the Swayambhuanath Temple and up the 365 unevenly cut rock steps and into the gazing stares of Buddha's Eyes. The panoramic views from the top are awe inspiring. On a clear day, most of the Kathmandu City Valley is visible, as are the highest white mountains in the far distance. Every animal is allowed to be at the temple, so hundreds of monkeys play and climb on every building and tree. (Swayambhunath is also called \"Monkey Temple\") I saw several dogs sleeping in the shaded areas, and even a family of goats standing near one stupa. Very early in the morning, the temple is quite, calm and restful. The later in the day, more and more tourists, pilgrims, vendors and loudness move into the area and Swayambhunath becomes a crowded & noisy \"attraction\" rather than a much revered sacred place of worship and meditation. The earthquake in April 2015 damaged one of the tall stupas and it fell completely down. There used to be a restaurant in an upper part, which was also damaged and closed as of October 02, 2015, anyway. Early in the morning this ancient temple is absolutely breath-taking and serene. It's most definitely worth the climb up the steps!!"

On the far side are a number of pools that the monkey population use for cooling off, you can spend ages here watching their antics. Watch you bags and don't eat in front of the monkeys or you'll get some unwanted attention!"

The golden \"Swayambhunath Stupa\", most commonly known as the \"Monkey Temple\", is the oldest and probably one of the most revered holy shrines in all Kathmandu. Its construction dates as far back as the 5th Century. It is a must see in your visit to Nepal's capital city. Strong legs and comfortable shoes are strongly needed, as a long stairway, with 365 steps, leads to the sacred stupa. Keep your good spirits and enjoy a breathtaking view of Kathmandu and its valley. \"Holy\" monkeys are everywhere! Keep your eyes wide opened, your belongings safely secured and watch carefully your steps. Monkeys are not at all reliable! And never never feed them! Souvenir shops are everywhere! I visited Kathmandu on February 2015, nearly two and a half months before the terrible earthquake that devastated Nepal on April 25, 2015. The \"Swayambhunath\" complex has been severely damaged by the earthquake, but the main stupa survived and the remaining structures are safe and opened to public. Visiting Nepal is a form of supporting this country's efforts towards reconstruction. Don't give up your plans! Enjoy!"

They are harmless if not provoked and are very comfortable walking beside you. Remember; however, that they are wild and should never be pet or approached. I found the smells to be quite intense - at times a strong mixture of monkey waste and incense. It might be wise for sensitive travelers to be prepared with a mask.

Most tourists and visitors are taken only to the top where there is a concentration of small shrines topped by the famous \"Buddha eyes\" golden steeple and miss seeing the three huge golden statues at the foot of the hill!Visitors should be warned to take good care of their personal belongings for fear of them being snatched by the wily and quick-fingered hordes of monkeys that roam the complex! And, if you intend to feed them and the stray dogs, don't be surprised to see them fight over the tidbits you offer, although most are shy and wary of the human visitors and will make a hasty retreat at any sudden move! Also, unlike the other Great Stupa, there are many shops and stalls selling spiritual ware interspersed somewhat haphazardly amongst the various small shrines in the complex, making the Stupa more of a shopping attraction than a holy site for me. one also needs to walk the steps and pathways up and down the complex so proper shoes are recommended for this excursion."

This temple on the mountaintop was my most favorite place for spiritual respite. Post-earthquake it still was.You can still get up there. The front maIn stairway is blocked at the top. Take the road around to the left of the main front stairway and you will see a stairway going up on your right --- take it all the way to the top where the monastery is (only minor damage). From there you can see to the next hill with the main white stupa. You can get there from the monastery. The front stairway was where the ticket booth used to be. Going around the left side and up --- no ticket booth.Two weeks after the earthquake the locals had once again reclaimed the top for their rituals. 5 houses and 3 smaller temples up there are undamaged, the rest of the structures are still there and even though damaged you can still get the feeling of what it was like pre-earthquake. The main white stupa is remarkably undamaged --- you can circle it and all the prayer wheels are also intact.Another must-do here is to walk around the entire base of the mountain. On the backside, undamaged, are 3 very large golden buddhas and a wonderful active temple area. If you continue around the circular base you will see, undamaged, the entire base white wall and also many huge prayer wheels in small enclosures. Walk slow, absorb it all. You can easily spend 2-3 hours wandering around here. Then ask a local where Nip's Cafe is and have a marvelous breakfast (or lunch or dinner).AMAZING STILL ! Early morning is best when you will encounter all the locals doing their ritualistic circular walk of the mountain base. I guarantee you will not be disappointed !"

Visited the Swayambunath Stupa and Complex on a cloudy morning of 1 January 2015.The complex is known also as the Temple of the Monkeys , tough we saw that not too many monkeys ,insted, a lot of pigeons here.Took about 20 minutes to reach the complex,located on the western side of Kathmandu city ,our transportation was arranged by Outshine Adventures, as well as our friendly and knowledgeable guide ,Mr.Prasant.Center of the attraction is the Swayambunath Stupa , its the most sacred among Buddhist pilgrimage sites.For Tibetans and followers of Tibetan Buddhism, it is second only to BoudhanathThe Swayambhunath complex consists of a stupa, shrines and temples, like the Harati Devi,Anantapura Shikara some dating back to the Licchavi period. A Tibetan monastery the Dongak Chhyoling Old Monastery,the Buddha Thanka Treasure and more recent additions are also in this complex.The stupa has Buddha's eyes looking on all 4 directions, and eyebrows painted on. Between them, the number one (in Devanagari script) is painted in the fashion of a nose.There are also souvenir shops, restaurants and hostels nearby. The site has two access points: a long stairway with 365 steps,the leading directly to the main platform of the temple, which is from the top of the hill to the east ,and a car road around the hill from the south leading to the southwest entrance.Majestic Temple and Complex, and its one out of 7 UNESCO heritage sites in Kathmandu.Highly recommended to be visited.We are concerned about the condition of the complex after it suffered the Gorkha earthquake , hopefully if its damaged , it could be restored to its original state.We're wondered how was the condition of the stupa and complex, hopefully someone would upload pictures of it at the present."

Visited on 7 May, two weeks after the disaster quake hit this beautiful country, thankfully this so called monkey temple is totally not affected nor damage in many way by the quake unlike many other temple. Even so can see Red Cross tent build inside to help people in needs of help. This is definitely one of the best in Kathmandu to enjoy the best view of the cities itself, came about 5pm, just perfect when the sun is setting down, sit there pray ,soak the atmosphere with an awesome view, what else do you expect from this beautiful and serene temple , awesome .

            "review": "Just breathtaking!. Swayambhunath Temple (or Monkey Temple as most locals and cab drivers call it) is located at a hilltop that requires a bit of physical effort to get to, but I can assure you that it's worth it. The temple itself is like a miniature of what you would see at Boudhanath, but has a different feel to it due to the large amount of animals living there - especially monkeys, hence the name. The monkeys themselves are non-violent creatures and definitely one of the main draws to visit; just don't try to feed them. Even if you're not into the beautiful stupa and the various temples and shops of art, singing bowls, and other ceremonial souvenirs surrounding the hilltop, the breathtaking view of Kathmandu is well worth the price of admission.Unfortunately, based on recent photos from media and local friends, Swayambhunath has suffered quite extensive damage due to the earthquake. Although the stupa still stands with minor damage, lots of the surrounding temples, buildings, and the stairs leading up to the temple are heavily damaged. Hopefully after rescue and recovery efforts are made to the country and affected residents, they can start to rebuild their heritage again in an even better and brighter way. I hope to have another chance to revisit the beautiful country of Nepal and experience its cultural heritage soon."

The view from the top is definitely worth all of the stairs. Going in the afternoon/evening ensures the best view as the skies are the clearest, you will be able to have a 360 degree panorama view of Kathmandu. There are souvenir shops around the Stupa, some have some really amazing paintings. The Stupa itself and surrounding temples are an amazing sight, everything is very intricately detailed. A must see if you're in Kathmandu.Watch out for the monkeys as they can be known to be aggressive. Also keep your wits about you with people out to make a dollar, they follow you talking about the history of the Stupa and then demand money for their troubles. The stairs are also lined with beggars"

Monkeys abound and were very active probably because of all the activity but even so they can be aggressive. Don't approach or try to feed. Guides offer services - be wary about pricing.

From there you can walk around in the park and view the buildings, monkeys and from the top there is a great view of Kathmandu. Nobody bothers you here. When you walk down to the exit that is situated lower, there will be people trying to sell you stuff. You can take a different path down if you want to be left alone. There is no ticket counter at the bottom, so if you want to save money you can walk the stairs up to the temple. Still worth the money aswell though. This is a nice place to visit and easily acessible, so when you have 2 or 3 hours to spare (including taxi ride) this is a good place to go. Taxi ride back to Thamel was 400NPR. You can probably get the taxi rides cheaper if you try harder then is did, but i thought it was about right for the distance."

We started our 4 days visit to Kathmandu with a visit to this Temple / Stupa and it was a good decision.Not too fat from Thamel by taxi our driver tried to convince us the steps were far too challenging for a couple of 50 year olds so he would take us up the (far longer route) to the back of the temple. Utter tosh - it's a pleasant 15 to 20 min hike up steps past religious idols monkeys and small stalls to reach the Stupa. There is a small ticket stall very close to the stop of the steps where non nepali (Or non Asian as i didn't see any indian tourists get charged) tourists pay a relativley modest entrance fee.The Stupa is large and the area around it affords great views over the city - ideal for getting ones bearings. There are plenty of locals attending to their relifious devotions to make this a genuinley interesting place to watch the Nepali way of religious life. That said there are plenty of large tour groups as well.Behind the large stupa are a few small temples and a plethora of smaller religious icons and mini stupas which are fascinating to wander around and take photos or observe life.All in all very well worth the not too demanding walk up the stairs to get here and a brilliant place to get ones bearings."

Second, the views from the hilltop over surrounding Kathmandu are good. Third, the Temple itself is fascinating, with its proliferation of prayer wheels and flags, stupas, and interesting customs. The only blot on the experience was a persistent beggar who wouldn't leave me alone."

A reasonable walk from Thamel getting you out of the more touristy areas, along busy streets, over a disgustingly dirty river, and finally up all those steep steps to the temple itself. A good place to buy prayer flags if you're so inclined. Although the temple itself offers little more than others, the location high up on a hill makes it special. Great place to arrive latish, hang out watching people and the sun set. As with so many other places it's a bit annoying how randomly they apply entrance fees - if you're coming in along the only road where there's a booth and if they happen to be paying attention. Highly recommended."

Once having reached Swayambhu, it was a steep flight of steps to the top of the hill. The monicker Monkey Hill was amusing and not too apt because in India we are used to monkeys in most hill temples\u2026 :-)There are water troughs where monkeys, dogs and pigeons drink water. There is an area where these animals and birds are fed too. However this did not stop a monkey from snatching a bar of chocolate from another tourist.The view of Kathmandu is stunning. But it brings into focus the urban sprawl\u2026.Tip: All the streets all look the same. So if you too choose to walk to Swayambhu, I advise you to carry a map and to ask for directions regularly. We needed to confirm with the locals that we were taking the correct route while walking back to Chetrapati. And do read about this World Heritage Site before making the visit."

As the sunsets you can get a breathtaking view of the Kathmadu city. There are a number of shrines around the stupa and each has its own story and history so it is useful to read about them before the visit."

You can get a cheap taxi around 250-300 rupees from the Thamel area that will take you to the bottom of the temple, which you can then walk the steep path up towards the temple (be prepared to meet many a monkey). It will cost around 200 rupees to enter when you arrive if I remember correctly. The temple is a stunning sight, one you will never forget. Catch a photo with pigeons in flight that swarm near the temple, or a selfie with a monkey, (be careful they'll steal your stuff). If you're lucky and it isn't foggy, you can see the whole Kathmandu Valley, it's quite special! If you're looking for a cultural experience, it's all on show at the monkey temple!"

Somehow it is also known these days for tourist as monkey temple, simply because there are monkeys in and around the temple. The temple is the oldest in Kathmandu valley and is one of the world heritage sites. The iconography of two tall temples on either side the main stupa is surprisingly resemble with that of Orissa in India. I came to know that the Shantikar, the prince from Orissa visited this temple during 5th century. You see the Shantikar temple on the north west side of the main stupa, who is believed to have been meditating below the temple since centuries. The main stupa houses five buddhas and bodhisattvas (one who aspires to become Buddha and is on the bodhisattva path). This means that this stupa is of five Buddhas (Buddhas in metaphorical sense). The Amitabh Buddha on the western part of the main stupa is revered much by the devotees. There is also Ajima temple just by the side of the main stupa who is protectorate of children in Kathmandu valley."

The monkeys, while contributing their own brand of exoticism, do not add much more to the place than what you would expect. Sacred they may be but their manners leave something to be desired!

Perhaps our experience was an enigma, but my friend and I arrived at the base of the stairs to find the place eerie, dirty, and unwelcoming (unlike most everywhere else we visited in Nepal). The people along the stairs of the temple were chastising, and when we arrived at the top we both had the sensation that something sinister was up. I know that may come across as hokey or strange sounding; I'd be sceptical reading that, but it was what we experienced. The monkeys were also kind of terrifying. They overrun the place and a group of them broke into a screeching fight right next to us. We couldn't get out of their soon enough. Maybe it would have been a different experience if we'd gone earlier in the day, but upon the recommendation that we see the sunset there, we went in the evening. This lent to the feeling that the place was touched with (for lack of a more appropriate term) evil. Make of that what you will. I'm not one to scandalize, only trying to honestly review our experience. Definitely will not be returning there.

As everyone notes, the steps leading up are many and steep, but if you take your time, they're not bad and the rewards are well worth it. Be on guard for marauding monkeys, which can be aggressive and easily attracted by shiny or colourful objects and pretty much any item they can snatch."

Each prayer wheel carries the sacred mantra 'om mani padme hum' which means 'hail to the jewel in the lotus'. The prayer flags also carry Tibetan mantras.

They are pretty sly with tickets too and don't try and charge you 'til you are about 20 steps from the top, although it was only about $2.50.At the top there are plenty of people selling drinks and jewellery etc. but the views and the monkeys are the draw.

The mix of people is fascinating, with everything from the devout to tourists to couples having wedding photos taken, and mixed in are the monkeys and the usual stray dogs. Don't take food, as the monkeys are great at snatching it, and will try to pick your pocket if stray ends of a bag are protruding from it.

I visited this place twice first time with family so took the shortest route up. The Stupa is a beautiful architectural wonder with ancient sculptures, carvings, the humongous bells with inscription, and so is the reason its also a world heritage site.Don't forget to light ghee diyas at the Stupa and ask for you wish in the wishing well. To ask for a wish, you need to toss a coin and for the vessel which sits right under Buddha's statue."

            "review": "A uniquely Nepalese mix of Buddhism and Hinduism, very comercialised but a must see!. The number one must-see place in Kathmandu, Swayambhunath temple (though you'll have to tell the cabby \"Monkey temple\" before he'll understand where you want to go) is a large complex atop a hill just a bit outside Kathmandu's central district. When you go there, don't take a tour bus that drives you to the west entrance, but walk all 365 steps up the east side. Not only is it a great workout, you get beautiful views of the Kathmandu valley. You will more than likely be greeted by a person saying you'll need them to tell you all about the temple, and unless you are very familiar with the unique blend of religions expressed here, you might be better off believing them. After the climb (and a few minutes to catch your breath) you walk around the Stupa [CLOCKWISE] and take in the sights and sounds of the locals and pilgrims at prayer, both clearly Hindu, Buddhist and a mix of the two. In the courtyard you will see many shrines and relics as well as a large dorje or thunderbolt, the symbol of Tibetan buddhism.Take the opportunity to visit and quiet yourself in the adjacent monastery, where you will also find a beautiful mandala (one of the forms of thanka painting) apparently made by his Holiness the Dalai Lama. Again, walk clockwise through the building (start by walking left from the door) and remove your shoes, even if the guide just walks in, as it is an expected sign of respect. Oh, and when you getthe fancy to spin the prayer wheels (all around the outside of the Stupa and a big big one in the monastery) you spin them with the RIGHT hand. It is not in poor taste to direct people traveling in the wrong direction as to the correct path, by the way, and many will appreciate the good karma you are bestowing them. Thanka's are also available for purchase in the complex, as well as a lecture on the making process delivered in good English, if somewhat mechanically. Thanka art is not usually sold by the Tibetans and there is a certain dilemma about buying these beautiful works of religious devotion. - Whatever you do, don't be fooled into buying the poor flashy reproductions available in Thamel! Be prepared to spend premium prices ($200 and up) on the higher quality ones, these are no mere souvenirs! Other sights in the complex include the swimming pool for the monkeys, who may or may not be swimming, but will definitely be hunting for any and all unatended food and rip apart any plastic bag they see, no matter how scary the person holding it may be. The monkeys are the first thing you see, approaching the temple hill and are with you all throughout your visit. And they can be vicious. Stay clear of them and they will mostly leave you alone. Hopefully. Next to the monkey pool is a fountain with a pot that people toss coins into for luck. Most seem to miss, though. If you want to join in and show of your skills, you'll need to exchange money for copper coins at one of the nearby vendors sitting on carpers along the sides with piles of coins ready in front of them. This obviously, because local currency is rather short in the coin section. Around this is also a veritable bazaar of stalls selling all the ubiquitous souvenirs and curios. Watch out or you may find yourself surrounded by people packing stuff in plastic bags and rattling off how much you owe them. This really is a huge tourist trap! If you came in from the west entrance, feel free to read this guide from bottom to top, to get an idea of the order you will see things in."

There are numerous temples within the large complex - all around the main largest white stupa. You can easily hire a guide as soon as you enter the complex but we preferred to stroll about with map in hand. Be prepared for lots of 'gangs' of monkeys running or sitting around and although I did not experience anything, you should exercise caution in case you get too near and they snatch any of your belongings. The views of Kathmandu are amazing. As a guide we had completed all the sightseeing we wanted to do in under 2 hours - and that included a short refreshment break."

Once there you are rewarded by awe inspiring views of Kathmandu and the surrounding hills. This stupa is more commonly known now as \"the monkey temple\", so if you decide to walk there (which I highly recommend), then ask locals for 'monkey temple\" because you will surely make an idiot out of yourself trying to pronounce Swayambhunath and be completely misunderstood.The monkeys are certainly an attraction, but they can be highly aggressive, so do not under any circumstances expose snacks or foodstuffs around them or you will surely regret it!The temple itself is... well words cannot adequately convey its sheer beauty. Maybe photos will give you a better idea, but even photos do not capture it adequately. Totally worth the arduous climb... and once again, if you are a regular visitor you will soon work out the way that the locals avoid paying the ridiculously low charges levied upon them!"

Hundreds of monkeys scrambling into and around the trees; feeding on offerings; grooming their babies. Monkeys, indeed, were everywhere. They mostly minded their business, though one of our travelers had a bag with a newly purchased necklace snatched by a brazen monkey.We started at the base of small hill. Cars can't go beyond this point. There was a wonderful pool with many prayer flags and a gilt statue of the Buddha in the center. An umbrella was set above him. This was called the World Peace Pond according to a sign. We walked up and up...some three hundred steps and talked with a monk halfway up. Nice fellow; he told of his visit to the U.S.At the top are many shrines and temples, banks of prayer wheels, and monasteries. Legend tells of how Majushri had his hair cut at Swayambhunath. And each hair became a tree on this hillside; the lice became monkeys. Note how richly decorated the statues are here and take some time to savor the superb views of the city from this hill. Don't feed the monkeys; but do take some time for shopping. There were many fine shops and touristy venues to buy things. Prices were very good and items were somewhat different than in other spots."

You could literally spend a hour just watching the monkeys go about their day. It was very safe with the monkeys around, just make sure you don't have any food or drinks hanging out of your bag or in your hand or it will be snatched by a monkey. The temple overlooks all of Kathmandu which is an amazing view. The prayer flags all over the temple and throughout the surrounding area is magnificent to see. Overall, there's lots to see and walk around to experience and I would highly recommend it."

It would be good if this place had a small booklet giving more info and an insight to the place as a whole. We enjoyed our time here and latterly were asked to leave as all other tourists were as the dignitories were arriving to visit in private. I would say it is a good place to visit; 1 for what it is and represents and 2 as a good city viewpoint. Try to get there using the back streets as there lies a different flavour to Thamal and the city centre parts."

I saw a monkey with a big cut on it's leg and it was quite saddening. When I went to the Monkey forest in Bali the monkeys were all well taken care of and in good state with a first aid place available nearby.

I went at dusk and the colors were wonderful. You can see a number of people walking around the Stupa (clockwise) and a ton of monkeys!! If you walk down the other side, the view is also nice - and more monkeys!!This is a highly recommended temple - just tell your driver \"Monkey Temple\", as most people know it by this name, as well s Swayambhunath."

The cost is 200 rupees for foreigners at the ticket booth on the main steps from the east, but the site is easily accessed for free, from the secondary entrance, from the road along the south side of the hill, and even from stairs from the road on the north side.Along the entire perimeter of the bottom of the hill is a low wall containing prayer wheels. And if you go to the bottom of the hill, to the south and west, near the ring road, there are lots of smaller Buddhist temples, some with the large prayer wheels inside, and one complex with large Buddha statues. I went here and it was such a nice surprise.It is nice just to hang out and observe the religious customs. There are plenty of wares to be purchased, and a lot of advertised rooftop cafes and restaurants. I got a tea and sat on the ground level to observe the Buddhists doing their prayers."

It was really scary!!!I just went there in the 3rd evening of Tihar festival (Festival of light) and the view of Kathmandu was magnificent!. The whole city is lit up in lights, which is a luxury and only happens once a year during Tihar. The stupa is lit up at night as well with light bulbs. I was sort of expecting lots of candles but the reality is there's no one who has enough time to light that many candles. However, still a beautiful place to visit and hang out with incredible view of Kathmandu."

But the silver lining of of those steps is that on each level there are parts of the temple that are worth circling before taking the steps to the next level. Such beautiful and ornate statues, such a lovely sight of prayer flags. There are little market stalls that will sell you little trinkets for keepsakes of the really marvelous temple site. There's a great cafe at the very top so that you can quench your thirst with a Nepali Masala Tea or a Lassi. This is a 'not to be missed' famous site in Nepal."

This is such a beautiful temple...one of my favorites in Kathmandu; however, this is also called the Monkey Temple for a reason...there are monkeys everywhere, so don't have any food visible and keep your belongings close or in a closed bag. They won't attack you or anything, but if you have something they want, beware! My friend set his water bottle down to take a picture and the monkeys took it and bit/tore it open! They're pretty funny to watch, I'll admit.The little shops all around the temple are more expensive, but it's nice to get a keepsake from such a beautiful temple. I bought one of the nicest singing bowls I could find from a shop by this temple."

The vendors encourage you to buy eatables for monkeys and the monkeys look forward from every visitor something to eat. Avoid buying and the monkeys avoid you, anything in hand they expect you to share with them. Be careful with cameras and mobiles.very hot during a sunny day but good to take photos. The city looks nice from the top and you get varieties of arts and crafts with local artists exhibiting their skill. Feel free to bargain and buy.Worth spending the time. The rest rooms are supposed to be free for tourists, willingly give them some money or ignore them if they demand money raising their voice."

Also there's a real Gompa where one can light up the candles to brighten the thinking of all beings. It is a very cool place to hang out for whatever reason, even to do some people-watching.

It is smaller than Boudhah Stupa , but definitely different . There was very peaceful athmosphere as the monks were saying prayers and people were sitting and singing songs in the name of Buddha and the view of Kathmandu from the top was breathtaking. If you are there up during the day i would recommend to take the stairs down so you can see the nice sculptors around."

Plenty of shops within the complex and there is an entrance fee. Go with an organised group with an official guide and it's worth the money, nothing worse coming half way across the world to see something and going away not having a clue about it. this Temple is one of many fine attractions that Nepal and Kathmandu has to offer and do your best to see as many as possible.

Your guide (if you have one) may tell you that its a good school and, in confidence, explain that a 20% discount on the price is good. The person in the store will serve water and explain the painting process (which is interesting). However, the prices are highly inflated and probably quadruple what things cost in Thamel.

True, as others mention, beware of the monkeys - but in my experience if you keep to yourself, monkeys will do the same. There is the option to climb up & down, or just down (and probably not at all) - so if this is a consideration in your travels, it might be a site to consider."

Walking to 'the Monkey Temple' continues to be one of the best free things to do in Kathmandu.There are important local things to see and participate in along the way: local markets, and crucial for travelers: affordable and good health care.Chhetrapati Free Clinic is at the Chhetrapati Chowk. It's not always free to 'foreigners,' but the doctors are excellent (Dr. Joshi, the ENT specialist, for example).There's a pharmacy attached, where I trust the medicines are authentic. The local eateries are also safe and good.In nearby Dhalko, Noor Opticals fitted me with bifocals with high-quality slightly tinted plastic lenses for $45. The testing equipment is new; results were quick and reliable. (I'm 65 so this matters...) Monu, 9803844363.Further on this recent walk, I stumbled on a funeral procession--something that was common to see in KTM 10 years ago. The pall bearers (indigenous Buddhists) headed toward a Tibetan gonpa (monastery) and invited me to sit with them to see the cremation ceremony. Since i'm a philosophical type, that was a great thing. It rained buckets and the ceremony lasted 6 hours. I was very happy. The walk from KTM to Swayambhu is a route that many Nepali processions use. I encourage you to at least see them. Don't be invasive or take photos. Happy trails!"

While there were less monkeys than I had seen previously at this temple (which is not necessarily a bad thing), the story of the lotus flower with the blue light that beckoned visitors to Kathmanu Valleyis charming. You can almost believe that lotus flower really is still there, under the facade of the stupa. The hilltop vista provides incredible views of the valley, and the 7th century buddha statue hidden in a corner underscores that this area is still relatively unspoiled. Definitely worth a visit."

            "review": "Monkeying Around. One of my favourite places in Kathmandu is the Swayambhunath Temple. Part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Swayambhunath is a Tibetan Buddhist site of worship atop a substantial hill in the Kathmandu Valley, and is well known for its resident holy monkeys. After all, it\u2019s not called the Monkey Temple for nothing!I had a nervy taxi ride from my hotel in Thamel all the way to Swayambhunath. I approached one taxi and asked how much for a return trip to the temple and I was quoted at 1200 rupees. This was too much for me, and I tried to haggle but the driver did not want to lower his price. So I walked up the road a little way and asked another driver, and he quoted me 750rupees, which was much closer to my original asking price of 500. I think my price was a bit hopeful, but in the end I was happy with what I got offered. 20 minutes later I had arrived at Swayambhunath Temple. My driver had taken me to the top of the temple, rather than drop me at the bottom so I could walk up the famous steps to the top. I don\u2019t know why he did this, as for most people climbing the stairs is one of the most important parts of the visit. Oh well, at least I saved my energy! The taxi driver waited for me in the car park ready for when I needed the lift back to Thamel.The admission cost for an adult ticket for a \u2018foreigner\u2019 at Swayambhunath is 300 rupees. The first thing I noticed after paying for my tickets was a nice little pond with a golden Buddha in the middle. There were little buckets beneath this statue into which locals were trying to throw coins, presumably for good luck and well-wishing. I saw some rather large monkeys around this area, some of which were stalking around the pond, and others were hiding in trees grooming each other. After a short while, I headed eastward up the steps to the main part of the temple where the stupa and monasteries are situated. I noticed many lines of prayer flags as I was walking up these steps, and it really adds to the atmosphere of being in the Himalayas, as well as reminding me of my escapades in Bhutan at the Taktsang Monastery in addition to the Boudhanath Stupa here in Kathmandu.There were many stray dogs at the top of these steps, but fortunately they were all sleeping around a giant red Buddha statue. I didn\u2019t want to disturb them so I went on my way quickly. Up here at the pinnacle of the hill, in addition to the stupa and the monasteries, I saw so many little shops and the odd caf\u00e9 or two. I didn\u2019t buy anything, but it was nice to peruse a little as I circled the stupa, and contrary to my expectations, the Nepali merchants were not pushy at all in trying to obtain my rupees!The main stupa of the Swayambhunath Temple is actually a mini version of the Boudhanath Stupa. However, here at Swayambhunath, there are other little decorative statues and monuments that encircle the stupa, including a giant Vajra. You will notice many of these pesky monkeys at this elevation at Swayambhunath, and although they didn\u2019t bother me personally, it is claimed that they can attack you if you they are hungry and see that you have food in your bags, so it is always wise to be wary.After a good 45 minutes or so up at the Swayambhunath Temple stupa walking around getting some cool photos, and enjoying great views of the very polluted Kathmandu Valley down below, I decided it was time to head back down to the car park where my taxi driver was waiting for me. I allowed myself one last little look at the some of the monkeys congregating around the entrance near the wishing pond. I then had a little look at some of the items on sale in a market within the temple compounds, and was startled to find real Ghurkha swords on sale, which I didn\u2019t think was very safe in an area which can be full of children. Still, I had a good time at Swayambhunath Temple, and I left with good memories of visiting yet another Tibetan Buddhist site."

If you are not in shape, take your time. There is a lot to see as you go up--monkeys, vendors, views, people, etc. Be sure to take some water along. Once you get to the top you are rewarded with spectacular views of the city and a rather spiritual experience as you explore the temple. Enjoy!"

The best way to get here is to take a cab or just book a car for a day and drive around town its much easier than haggling with taxi drivers.The stupa is set upon a hill so you can either drive half way up or if you are adventurous you can climb the steep stairs.When you are here do try and buy bodhchit bead prayer rosary. They are typical and quite valuable and difficult to come by everywhere.Be careful of the monkeys there are many. Normally they do not attack but, sometimes if they belief u are carrying food they may so please put away your plastic bags, backpacks and other bags are ok.There is a small museum area."

It is almost like a free trip to an animal sanctuary thrown in. The temple itself is very nice and atmospheric, but the main reason to get up to the top is the views that it affords. Perhaps even go for a drink in one of the rooftop caf\u00e9s they have to get that little bit higher and really soak it all in. Depending on when you go I'm sure that sunrise or sunset would both be equally stunning visually."

Do hold onto your belongings, as they will come and investigate and abscond with anything you don't pay attention to.

It is also known as the Monkey Temple as there are monkeys living in the north-west parts of the temple. The hill top, Swayambhunath complex consists of a stupa, a variety of shrines and temples, some dating back to the Licchavi period.The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on. Between them, there is something painted which looks like the nose - but is the Nepali symbol of 'unity'. The site has two access points I have tried both in different times: a long stairway, claimed to have 365 steps, which took 10 minutes for me to scale, leading directly to the main platform of the temple, which is from the top of the hill to the east. The first sight on reaching the top of the stairway is the large Vajra (symbol represent firmness of spirit and spiritual power). Another entrance is a car road around the hill from the south leading to the southwest entrance. Much of Swayambhunath's iconography comes from the Vajrayana tradition of Newar Buddhism (local resident of Kathmandu valley). However, the complex is also an important site for Buddhists of many schools, and is also revered by Hindus.,From Swaymbhunath you can view Kathmandu valley and enjoy being on the top of Kathmandu valley."

Sight itself was great with views back across the city and of the whole Kathmandu valley.

The temple itself is fairly basic, but still nice. There are lots of monkeys and scroungy wild dogs, especially at the top. Be especially careful of the monkeys and don't carry food or drinks with you. My favorite part was the great views of the city and the sunset."

Once we arrived, it was worth the trip, even I had to be careful among the money's so just make sure you don't show any hints of snacks, or even the noise of plastic bags. As you go uphill though, there are less and less moneys so you can concentrate on your visit, enjoying being on top of the city, taking photos etc. Same rule about the shops. If you are not interested, simply don't look at their products at all and they will leave you alone. They are overall friendly and polite people trying to make a living.Our driver dropped us off at the higher entrance to avoid the steep staircase, which you will see at the top and that's where you can take a panoramic view.We didn't stay for coffee as we continued our visit to the dubar square which was about 20min away by car"

This is a working temple area with Hindu temples and Buddhist temples occupying the same hill top area. The macaque monkeys are everywhere too but be careful not to touch or feed them. We had a guide to take us here and as he lives in Kathmandu, he tells the history of the site and I would recommend always going with a guide because you will understand more of what the temple area is used for. I love to see the giant birds flying overhead also. People try to sell you things as you go up to the top of the temple area but they get sopped now from following you all over which is refreshing."

The small and large monasteries are open and monks are chanting throughout the whole of the dawn (you can go in quietly and respectfully to sit and enjoy this); bells, cymbals and trumpets are sounded, Nepalese people are doing their morning rituals and exercises as the sun comes up and musicians are playing.

It's worth taking a breather here as they stretch upward and number 365 in total. One for every day in a year. A word of caution here, keep anything edible out of sight and hold on to anything that you might be carrying. This is not known as the Monkey Temple for no reason.They are expert bag snatchers and muggers and appear out of nowhere and the ice cream you were just about to put to your mouth will dissapear in an instant. But when you finaly reach the top not only do you get a wonderful view over the.city but the Prayer wheels spin continuesly sending out Karmic energy to the world. The huge Eyes on all 4 sides of the Temple looking down upon you, and in the background the deep Bass tones of the Monks Chanting and the Dulcet ring of Temple Bells, gives a magical air, if you can be silent to feel it.

If you love walking, take the 350 odd steps from the north side, else go to the southern side, there are only around 120 steps there. The whole place is teeming with monkeys, so don't do anything to disturb or agitate them. There are quite a few shops selling knickknacks. Don't forget to haggle, you can get the prices down by one-third easily. The views from the top of the city are spectacular. But don't ignore the small shrines and temples surrounding the main stupa, they are quite beautiful."

Like many tourist attractions in Kathmandu there is now an entrance fee, which you must pay after going up the 300 or so steps up to the top. On a clear day you will get an amazing view. Unless it just rained the night before, you're not likely to get a clear day. If you bring bananas for the monkeys, be careful. If they see you have a handfull of them they'll come and grab them from you. It's a great spot to hit really early in the morning before the crowds appear."

Wonderful fresh juices, tasty snacks and great views - a great place to round off your visit to the Stupa.

And somewhere to work off all those pounds that are accumulating from the great food available in Kathmandu. There is a 200NR fee at the top which is fair enough as tourism is the main foreign currency earner for the country and the site is reasonable well maintained."

It has been in use since the 5th century AD. This sacred site is also home to hundreds of monkeys considered holy to Tibetan Buddhists and Hindus. The site consists of a magnificent stupa as well as a variety of shrines and small temples. The Tibetan name for the site means 'Sublime Trees' for the many varieties of trees found on the hill. For Tibetans and followers of Tibetan Buddhism, it is second only to Boudhanath. On each of the four sides of the main stupa there is a pair of big eyes. These are symbolic of God's all-seeing perspective. There is no nose between the eyes but instead you can see a representation of the number one in the Nepali alphabet, telling that the single way to enlightenment is through the Buddhist path. Above each pair of eyes is a third eye, signifying the wisdom of looking within. No ears are shown because it is said the Buddha is not interested in hearing prayers in praise of him. Our guide very kindly suggested we enter the temple complex from the top and leave via the 365 steps. But the stupa has a far greater impact if you enter it by the stairway. It was rather crowded on the day we visited but we were still able to take great photos and admire the view over the Kathmandu Valley. This is a \u2018must see\u2019 in Kathmandu, it\u2019s a very spiritual place and the monkeys are delightful, just don\u2019t let them know if you have any food or you\u2019re likely to have it stolen!"

Next to the temple there is an excellent restaurant with a rooftop terrace offering an astouding view of the city of Kathmandu."

Get the taxi driver (300 rupees from Thamel) to take you up the top so you can walk DOWN the very steep stairs (especially if you have just returned from a long trek!)"

Immediately I was approached by the guide who said it was 200 R for the tour, I ended up giving him a big tip as I really enjoyed the tour and he was a great asset to the visit to the temple. He took me into see the Mandalas and I believe had I bought one he would have got a commission, but they were very expensive and I basically didn't want one. Although I really enjoyed the talk the guy gave about how the Mandalas where made I did feel pressured to buy, so if you don't want to be put in that situation don't go and look at the art. Apart from that the tour was very informative and a highlight of my trip to Nepal. I think my pictures speak for themselves and although the day was cloudy and a bit drizzly it didn't dampen the outing. I think I would class this as a must see when in Nepal."

Swayambunath (meaning \u201cself-arisen\u201d) Temple or the Monkey Temple (as there are holy monkeys living there) has spectacular, awesome panoramic views of Kathmandu valley. It sits on top of a hill. When you reach the top, you will see the whole of the Kathmandu valley which will make you feel that it was worth the climb. It is just on the outskirts of Kathmandu and is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal. Although the site is considered Buddhist, the place is revered by Buddhists and Hindus as well.The Swayambhunath complex consists of a giant Stupa (the stupa consists of a dome and a structure with Buddha\u2019s eyes - representing Wisdom and Compassion - looking in all four directions with the word \"unity\" in the main Nepali dialect between them), a large ensemble of shrines and temples, and also includes a Tibetan monastery, a museum and a library. This site has two access points: a long stairway, claimed to have 365 steps and a car road around the hill. As you are in the site, you\u2019ll hear the beautiful and relaxing Tibetan Buddhist chants.A note on monkeys: The place is overcrowded by hundreds of monkeys. There are two versions about them: 1) People warn that you might be harassed by monkeys who are clever enough to snatch your bags, hats or even camera; that they are a menace and that one should be careful of them.  2) Monkeys seemed to mind their own business, are quite well behaved are quite well behaved and won\u2019t bother anyone. In a word, they are not troublesome. MY personal opinion: I have always been used to monkeys confined in zoos. I\u2019m not saying this is right. I\u2019m just describing my experience. I didn\u2019t feel like having personal interactions with the hundreds of monkeys freely roaming this site! Instead, I enjoyed the aura of peacefulness that the place retains, turning a deaf ear to souvenir vendors, self-proclaimed guides, hawkers & gawkers!What to expect: Thousands of devotees paying their homage (mostly fruit and eatable stuff so the place is not clean indeed. Cleanliness ends up being an issue as in most parts of Asia). The wishing well at the bottom of the stupa: the idea is to flip a coin into a basket at the foot of an idol in the middle of a pond. Lovely! A lot of people competing! Fun! Culturally fascinating. It should be on your list.There is an entrance fee to the site for foreigners."

It sits on top of a hill, and is only a small walk from Thamel. The temple is shared by people of both Buddhists and Hindus, and you can see different aspects of their faith in different parts of the temple. A Stupa sits in the middle, and is surrounded by smaller structures, some housing Hindu gods.You reach the temple by walking up a big set of steps to the top. You can take breaks while climbing up these steps, with many rest points on the way. You can also get great views from these points, and enjoy some of the nature that lines the steps. I believe there is another entrance with more accessibility, but haven't seen it myself. Although people warn that you might be harassed by monkeys, the only harassment we've received were from souvenir vendors and self-proclaimed 'guides'. The monkeys seemed to mind their own business and not bother anyone really.I recommend that people visit this temple, but not reserve an entire day for it - although it is beautiful, it is not that big of a temple, and a few hours would suffice for a visit. Including it with other nearby attractions would probably be best."

However, some of the Hindus also believe that the term \"Swayambhu\" refers to God Vishna. On your way up, there will be so many sellers who try to sell small items such as bracelets, necklaces, singing bowls (a small bowl which is sold with a piece of wood. When you rub this piece of wood, it makes the \"om\" sound and it is used in Nepal for meditation). The sellers will be a bit of a trouble if you stop to just look at the items which are for sale. They will tell you that it is bad luck for them if you do not buy anything and would emotionally blackmail you into buying things. When you reach the top, you would see the whole Kathmandu valley which will make you feel that it was worth the climb. My husband and I spent some time on top of this place. You will constantly hear the Tibetan Buddhist chant \"om mani padme hum\" which roughly translates as the \"jewel of the flower\" which I believe to be a reference to the birth of Prince Siddhartha who later became Lord Buddha. This phrase is written over small cylindrical objects all around the stupa which is situated on the top of the hill. This is a 'must see' for all tourists who visit Nepal!"

This is a photographers paradise and Saturday is especially worth a visit as there is plenty to see and watch. The usual bartering needs to be done wit the stall holders who will always overprice as this is a big tourist attraction. Go early and you can get a better deal as the first customer of the day."

The stupa of Monkey Temple is also pretty, although not as amazing as that of the Boudhanath.Entrance fee for foreign tourists is 200 Nepalese rupees (approx USD 2), I think--not bad at all.

It is a great work out and the walker is rewarded with great city views and lots of inspiring photo opportunities. Be warned though, it can be a tough walk and can get very hot. Wear light clothing and go early to avoid the temperatures and crowds. The final approach is a 'never-ending' series of stairs laid into the mountain-steep slope. Take water and wear your most comfortable running shoes. There is a nominal entry fee at a kiosk located near the top of the stairs. It is home to hundreds of monkeys that can be a little aggressive and equally cheeky. Keep a close eye on your belongings as they are not afraid to grab anything you may set down. Sometimes we choose to walk right from Thamel but there is also the easier option of having a taxi take you up the back road. This road winds it's way almost 3/4 of the way to the top and you avoid all the front facing steps. If time, age, weather or health is an issue, this is the way to go, have the taxi wait for no charge). At the top are countless unique shops and keepsake stores. It is also an active Buddhist Monastery so you will undoubtedly see Monks of all ages in the surrounding buildings and walking amongst the many daily visitors. This attraction, located on the one of the city's only elevated areas is dramatic, spiritual and well worth a visit. (**a popular option is to have a taxi take you to the top of the back road, then after a couple of hours spent exploring, walk back home to your hotel in Thamel**) Highly Recommend!"

It is easier to walk down the stairs to the bottom than to go from down to up.While going down the stairs it is slightly steep so hold the railing.On the way down you can pick up singing bowls and other things.Bargain and you can get a lower price.Mind the monkeys especially if you have bags.DEFINITELY WORTH THE VISIT!!!"

Second, frankly the number of hawkers and stores even within the stupa itself was a very big turn off; third, well you can chose the monkeys who run across your feet or the pigeons that leave their tidings literally everywhere (including on two women who were on the receiving end in front of me). I will say the view, if you can get to the viewing area through the throng of people was amazing. That said we were pushed constantly to move along and not take up space and time to take pictures.

It is a bit of a climb, there are over 300 steps, so be prepared for that, but once you are up, it is worth it. It is a curious mixture of bhuddist and hindu although officially it is a bhuddist temple. We made it there early in the morning and we think perhaps that is why there were few monkeys and they were all well behaved. We did however meet someone who was bitten by one, so they are obviously not as timid as they appeared. The views from the Tempe are quite something in their own right."

View of Kathmandu city is superb and would imagine a visit in the evening will be lovelier. There is a Hindu and Buddhist praying sites on the main stupa ground, very interesting. On the entrance ground, there is a newly built pond with a Buddha statue in the middle where many will try throwing coin into the bowl held.\u2026\u2026..

I spent some time there - it is a very peaceful place and mainly because not enough people make a trip here. The noisy tourists and their cameras are not seen here. Bodhnath is certainly better, but you should visit this one if you have spare time. It is a good short uphill hike too - helps if you are planning to hike in Nepal !"

There are the ubiquitous hawkers on the way up but they have a living to make and we are tourists with more money than sense some times!On the way in we paid the small entrance fee and then were immediately entrance by the stupa with Buddha's eyes looking over the whole of the city.There are shops, other temples and rooftop restaurants where it is possible to while away a few hours, soak up the atmosphere and decide which way down. We walked down the opposite side past a small shrine in a pond where you can throw small coins and make a wish. The walk this side also takes you past the very poorly maintained Natural History Musuem. It is one of the best temples and places to visit while you are there as it gives ypu on a clear day a birds eye view of Katmandu."

There are a Hindu temple and Buddhist temple on top of a long flight of stairs which lead through a maze of hawkers and artisans. Watch out for the monkeys, don't feed them and don't look them in the eye as it is seen as aggression. The west side has a temple and a market. There are 3 huge Buddha statues just up from the west market. It is a nice walk around the kora at the base of the mountain in an easy hour. Swayambunath is well worth it for the views over Kathmandu and the valley."

They are very smart and will surround you in matter of seconds! If happened, just through the food to them!Get your ticket after payment as you can come back here without further payment. I guess the person should stamp it with your passport and visa number on back side.The temple at top is amazing. You can see serious prayers going around the main temple clockwise; bending, kneeing and lying down on the floor again and again and again. Lots of Respect.The view to the city is amazing. If you have read about the history of this place, try imagining the ancient lake and how shiva was overlooking the valley.There are many birds of prey flying around and coming down on surrounding trees.You can hang around here for couple of hours, depends to your interests in history.Very interesting sight.Totally Recommended."

It helps explain why the Nepalese people are widely tolerant of everyone's religious choice regardless of faith. If all people were equally understanding there would be far less conflict in the world today. The site is quite large and takes at minimum of several hours to see, but give yourself another hour or two so as to walk around the entire complex. There's lots of shop selling just about everything, prices are good - actually some of the best we found on the trip. Be sure to barter - meaning walk away the first two times.

In contrast to Bodnath Stupa, where I felt refreshed when reluctantly leaving it, I couldn't get out of here fast enough. i felt I was \"ticking a box\" instead of exploring another culture's spirituality."

It is also known as the Monkey Temple as there are holy monkeys living in the north-west parts of the temple.The Swayambhunath complex consists of a stupa, a variety of shrines and temples, some dating back to the Licchavi period.The stupa has Buddha's eyes and eyebrows painted on. Between them, there is something painted which looks like the nose - but is the Nepali symbol of 'unity'.There are also shops, restaurants and hostels. The site has two access points: a long stairway, claimed to have 365 steps, leading directly to the main platform of the temple, which is from the top of the hill to the east; and a car road around the hill from the south leading to the southwest entrance. The first sight on reaching the top of the stairway is the Vajra.According to Swayambhu Purana, the entire valley was once filled with an enormous lake, out of which grew a lotus. The valley came to be known as Swayambhu, meaning \"Self-Created.\" The name comes from an eternal self-existent flame (swaya\u1e43bhu) over which a stupa was later built.Each morning before dawn hundreds of Buddhist (Vajrayana) and Hindu pilgrims ascend the 365 steps from eastern side that lead up the hill, passing the gilded Vajra (Tibetan: Dorje) and two lions guarding the entrance, and begin a series of clockwise circumambulations of the stupa."

There are a very few signs for the temple in the streets in Thamel, and it would be fairly easy to get lost, but it's worth persisting (takes, say, 30 minutes). On the right, just after the bridge, there is an initial small temple you can visit. On the bridge, stop and view the huge accumulation of garbage (plastic bags etc) in the water and ponder whether tourism and development have been a benefit for this city? Indeed, you can ponder this almost everywhere in Kathmandu.Once at the Swayambhu Temple, there are two entrances - the very steep-stepped \"town side\" entrance, which is quite a challenge to climb, steep steps and lots of them, and a rather more gentle approach from behind the temple, where it seems most transport drops and picks up. Access for people with mobility problems would be very difficult. As you'd expect, there are numerous monkeys (Macaques?) around. We're not great fans of monkeys - as we have a lot of these critters where we live at home - but they seem on the whole reasonably docile and we didn't witness any confrontations or monkey bag-snatches that sometimes occur elsewhere. They are of course great climbers and get everywhere. In many places, the adult males (especially) can be aggressive. In general, it's a big mistake to feed monkeys - it has changed their habits, made them pretty fearless and demanding, and also the food people give them is often bad for them. But, nevertheless, people do so ....We noticed some people were charged an entry fee both at the bottom of the steep steps (NRs150?) and again at an official post near the top (NRs200), and we heard some students complaining about this. Most likely only the NRs200 collected at the top (or at the entrance gate at the more gentle approach) is official. Gifts and artifacts at the top are of course overpriced. Bargaining no doubt would work, if you really want to buy things. But this temple is really a place for the views over the Kath. Valley, where you can see the extended views but also, sadly, the air pollution.If you go back by taxi, of course, these need careful bargaining and many are not in great condition."

It's disappointing how such an important religious site can be allowed, by its users, to be chronically filthy, with dog and monkey feces (often is a diarrheal-looking state) everywhere, locals spitting everywhere and clearing their sinuses on the floor. I also saw a huge dead rat lying out in the open. The shrines themselves were also in very poor repair...and I don't mean intriguingly so, like an Angkor-temple\u2019s poor state of repair, for example...I mean decrepit and junk-looking. Very disappointing."

Indeed, the temple itself is nothing special inside but outside you have plenty souvenir shops, caffe and a chillout place. There are 2 ways to get there but both of them involve steps climbing... You have to pay for the entrance - about 200 RPS if i remember well.If you want to avoid the crowd come at early morning and avoid weekends. Monkeys can be sometimes tricky but most of the time they are just looking for food and don't care about you or them being photographed.

Great views from the top and you can watch the kites (birds) soaring above the city. Theres an imprisoned saint up here (who you can't see) and a working monastary (which you can) Lots of stalls and it feels less spiritual than Boudhanath as its less used as an actual centre of worship. but well worth a visit if you can face the climb.

The entry fees for both have gone up every time we've visited. I recommend the stairs at Swayambhunath, if you have strong legs, good lungs and the ability to contend with beggars. The leg work will give you a taste of trekking if you are headed to the hills. If your legs and lungs aren't in great shape, you can drive almost up to the Stupa from the back gate.There are lots of monkeys and they can be very peaceful if you leave them alone. However, you never know what will provoke a monkey and this last time one of the buggers rushed me simply for taking his photo. Their teeth are quite impressive. (See photo) They are also thieves, especially of shiney things and food. I have not personally been victim of a monkey robbery, but I have seen it happen. These are not pet monkeys. It is best to keep that in mind.This is a deeply spiritual place for some people and it is important to remember that the monks prostrating themselves are worshipping, not offering photo ops. They will pose for you to take a photo sometimes, but please ask before just snapping away. It is the height of rudness to interrupt someone during worship though. There are many opportunities to photograph images of the temple itself, and the pigeons and the monkeys (if you're ready to run).  It is apparently very important to walk to your left when circling the stupa or the prayer wheels. There is a myriad of symbolism here, and unfortunately I do not understand most of it. It would probably take a very long time to understand all of the layers of religion in this one location."

Even if all the other UNESCO sites and stupas around Kathmandu had monkey residents, still 'Swayambu' would be my favorite based on location and relative tranquility as compared to all the other heavily commercialized stupa spots around town.There is a cool upstairs cafe, Nirvana, serving the usual cold drinks at street level prices, so that has to be respected. This was featured in Baraka, however, I wonder why Fricke didn't video the macaques swinging around. Do be aware of their intrepid nature towards humans with any sort of tangible food in hand. Simply put, if you could only visit one stupa, make it this one. It is close enough to the city center, yet towers high above the valley making for a perfect sunset retreat."

When you finally reach the top (the last part is pretty steep and don't forget the altitude of Kathmandu), you are just happy you made it. Just go left onto the terrace and admire the beautiful view of Kathmandu and the Himalaya's. In the middle of the complex there is the stupa. The dome can be full with monkey's. There are different tempels there, Hindu and buddist. There are also little ch\u00f6rten and not a lot of room to walk. Despite of this all and the fact that you can also buy souvenirs at a not so very good price, I strongly recommend a visit. Especially late in the afternoon, when the sunlight isn't that strong anymore. Afterwards walking down again, just walk back to Thamel if you stay there.

I saw first time camera friendly monkeys.7. shops till the top are spoiling the beauty of the heritage big time.8. 50 NPR is the entrance fee for SAARC nationals and 200 NPR for non SAARC.Overall very nice experience must visit place.Over All nice experience."

At the top there are lots of interesting things to see and a wonderful view over the Kathmandu valley. This is not as peaceful a site as Bodnath, but is still worth a visit all the same.Also be prepared for many salesmen offering you goods at highly inflated prices on the way up and down. My advice is to bargain hard and be prepared to walk away - most of what they are selling can be bought much cheaper in Kathmandu itself.If you have the time and want to see some local life, it is possible to walk to Swayambu from Thamel - takes about 40 minutes, through Dhalko."

I'll never get sick of feeding the monkeys here - the trick is to put biscuits in a daypack, and only pull them out one at a time, when not too many monkeys are around. They gently take them out of your hand, or a few who are a little more curious may climb onto your shoulders and try to get into your bag! If they get a little too rough, just move to another area, they're quite territorial so won't follow you too far!There's a great, tiny gallery just behind the stupa as well - the artist is only around 25yrs old, is taught by his father, and does amazing stuff. Bought several water colours from him and he gave me a very fair price as well.Stunning views, great for panoramic shots, especially at sunset."

Apart from the poverty stricken individuals at the bottom of the stairs, the temple at the top, and the views (if you are blessed with a smog-free day) are very, very good. Don't miss the 'back-side' of the temple, or the western half. There is a working monastery there, huge old growth trees, much more shade, and of course - monkeys. Speaking of monkeys - once you get to the top of the incredibly long stone staircase (which is also patrolled by monkeys looking through trash or just lazing about) you will notice them everywhere. Some of the tourists try to feed them, to lure them in for better pictures - but if you don't want to be doing a midnight trade of $500 USD, over a fence, for the first dose of rabies immunoglobulin, then please do not feed them. They can become aggressive very quickly, and your finger may just look like a snack. They also seem to be irritated when starred at while you are wearing sunglasses. I'm not sure how this works, only that they seem to prefer being able to know what you are looking at.A taxi will always deposit you at the bottom of the main stairs, but it is best to exit the other side and walk a block or two before hailing a taxi - it will be cheaper."

Swayambhunath is Located on a hill west of the city, this is one of the most important pilgrim centers for the Buddhists who visit this place from far and wide. As one climbs up the 350 odd stairs, one is watched by the watchful eyes of the Buddha. which have been painted on all the four sides of the tower.While some say that these eyes are part of complex Tantric symbolism, others say that they are there to keep a benign eye on the faithful so that no harm comes to them.whatever be the reason, the fact remains that these eyes leave a lasting impression on the visitors. There are some 211 prayer mills surrounding the stupa. One striking features of the Swayambhunath Stupa is that it is surrounded by five Tathagathas, who are also referred to as Dhyanbuddhas, representing the five elements - earth, water, fire, wind and ether-of the cosmos. They are shown riding different animals.Akshobhya is shown on the elephant, Vajrocana on lion, Ratnasambhav on a horse, Amytabha riding peacock and Amoghasiddhi is seated on heavenly bird Garud."

We visited Swayambhunath Temple towards the end of our stay in Kathmandu and maybe our expectations were high and I must confess to being a little disappointed if I compare it to Bodnath or Pashupatinath. There are just far to many souvenir stalls all over the place that detract from the temple itself. The views I am sure were spectacular many years ago but as Kathmandu has developed you mostly see a sprawling city which in itself is quite interesting.There are two ways to get there, the first is up the longest steepest steps I have encountered in many years and my legs were like jelly when I had completed the trek. I would recommend driving up and the shortish walk to the top which still has plenty of steps.We went at around 11am, I am told it is much better to visit at dusk or early evening when the bulk of the street sellers have departed and the temple returns to it's sacred self. When we return to Kathmandu we will revisit in the evening and hope we have a more enjoyable experience."

I really appreciated the area as it was quieter compared to most of the city, and there are many trees as you walk up the pathway toward the Stupa. That being said, there is a bit of a climb, so wear comfortable footwear. If you enter through the main entrance, the cost is 200 NPR per person (that is less than $3.00 Canadian). There are also some restaurants that are open until 6 pm or later. I went here for dinner after dark with two friends and it was by far the best time to go in my opinion. There were very few people there and a group of monks was chanting and with the burning incense it felt like we had gone back in time. The Stupa was lit up, as you can see in the photo. Dinner was good and well-priced (I wish I could remember the name of the restaurant), and we had a view of the city.I would definitely recommend visiting Swayambhunath either in the early morning (6-8 am), or later in the evening (5-7 pm). That way you are more likely to avoid crowds and the heat. Also, there are two entrances, one of which takes longer to hike from, but is a pleasant walk. Allot a minimum of 2.5-3 hours of your day to visit, keeping in mind that the climb up the stairs may take extra time. From personal experience, be careful around the monkeys, if you are eating a snack they will not hesitate to grab it out of your hands!"

For me, the most enjoyable aspect of the temple was the horde of macaque monkeys running around and creating havoc. It's true; there's an entire gang of at least 50 of them that roam the top, usually feasting on trash people throw over the side. You can see them stealing french fries or marigolds, grooming each other, or getting into a blur of a nasty fight. Respect their power as they are not afraid of people and if provoked can and will bite. Monkey teeth are very sharp!! I could sit for hours watching their behavior, but I settled on 20 minutes."

One goes up through some 365 stairs, and the other is a car lane which leads straight up to one of the gates of the temple. You can enjoy 360 degree view of the Kathmandu valley from this hilltop temple. There are various other old architectural relics at this site, some are libraries and others are scattered temples. If you are a photography enthusiast this place gives you plenty of options for good clicks.

Best is that vehicle drops you on the backside of hill at a height. From there you reach the top of temple after covering steps. On downward journey one can go by steps as it seemed much easier.Entrance fee for Indians is 50 Nepali rupees, it is more for foreigners.There are lots of monkeys but normally they don't snatch your belongings and are comparatively of peaceful nature .Once u reach the top, you are greeted by fresh air and colorful prayer flags.

Take your time to climb and enjoy some old statues of Buddhas and Sanskrit words, motifs, carvings that line along the side of the stairs.

After the 365 steps that lead up the hill, you will pass the gilded Vajra (Tibetan: Dorje) and two lions guarding the entrance. The Swayambunath Stupa is impressive as you look at it. On each of the four sides of thestupa there are a pair of big eyes. These eyes are symbolic of God's all-seeing perspective to the four corners of the world. There is no nose between the eyes but rather a representation of the number one in the Nepali alphabet. This represent the single way to enlightenment is through the Buddhist path. Above each pair of eyes is another eye, the third eye, signifying the wisdom of looking within. No ears are shown because it is said the Buddha is not interested in hearing prayers in praise of him.The area surrounding the stupa is filled with chaityas, temples, painted images of deities and numerous other religious objects. There are many small shrines with statues of Tantric and shamanistic deities, prayer wheels. We were lucky to be there during the Nepali National Day, a public holiday. The place was crowded with people worshiping and making offerings, a photographer's treasure trove.We spent approximately 2-3 hours photographing and enjoying the view.

Lying to the north-west of the city, high on a hill overlooking the city, the Swayambunath complex is an ancient, sacred Buddhist pilgrimage site. The entrance stairway of 365 steps flutters with colourful prayer flags and the famous temple monkeys can be seen running around all over. The complex consists of a central stupa, several temples, shrines and a more modern tibetan monastery. Huge, mysterious buddhas eyes on top of the dome stare out knowingly over the Kathmandu valley and above this thirteen golden pinnacles symbolise the thirteen stages of enlightenment sensient beings have to go to reach Buddhahood.Swayambunath is not just an ancient religious site but an active, living one with pilgrims performing clockwise circumambulations around the stupas. The continual soft chanting of 'om mani padme hum' and the smell of incense and yak butter lamps create a magical atmosphere in the early morning. There is plenty to walk round and you may like some time to soak up the views so a half day is probably about the right amount of time. A rich cultural experience not to be missed."
