It was very disappointing because I had high-hopes seeing as this was the top-rated attraction in Marrakech on Trip Advisor. As a garden, it's very mediocre. I guess it's nice for a garden in the North African desert, but compared to gardens elsewhere in the world, it's nothing special. When we visited, it was absolutely packed with tourists, you couldn't walk two feet without having to dodge an idiot taking a selfie.Skip it, this garden will give you a very bad impression if you're expecting it to be the top attraction in Marrakech like I was."

It was 100drm to enter, this got you to see the gardens and the Berber museum within the gardens. The gardens were okay and I got the connection with Yves se Laurent, but felt the name jacked up the price because of the name. The garden was relatively small and it was okay but nothing that spectacular for the money. I would probably only have given it an average rating but for the museum. which although small I found the exhibits well presented and very interesting and it saved the visit for me and raised it to very good."

It's a short walk through the more modern part of the city and quite manageable on foot. Once we found the entrance (just off a main road and not obvious) we joined a short queue of tourists but only waited a few minutes. We visited in September which meant that the weather was not uncomfortably hot - mid to high 30s.The garden is larger than I expected and densely planted with shady tropical trees and plants and the most incredible collection of cacti. Many as tall as trees and others twisted into incredible shapes.The buildings, fountains and walls within the garden are painted the stunning Majorelle Blue which makes for some beautiful photographs.One of the buildings houses a small museum containing a really impressive collection of Berber artefacts, clothing and especially jewellery which is displayed in a small mirrored room which shows off the exhibits to perfection. Make sure you buy the extra, reasonably priced ticket at the entrance.A cool and welcome respite from the heat and a peaceful retreat from the bustle of the medina."

You can see it in less than 10 minutes if you want. it is really well maintained and it was designed by Yves saint laurent so that makes the price worth to see as you really can see the hand of the famous designer. the other thing really worth to see is the Berber Exposition/Museum - it is a magnificent collection of the different exponats connected with the life of Berber society."

Majorelle GardenThe garden was made in the 1920s by the French painter Jacques Majorelle, with marble pools, groves of bamboo, coconut palms and bougainvilleas and cactii. As the garden was designed by a painter, the garden is composed and coloured like a painting. Many of the built features were painted in a dark blue ('Majorelle Blue') In fact, Majorelle's garden rather than his paintings was his masterpiece. Water is an important feature of the garden - there are channels, lily-filled ponds and fountains. Majorelle was an avid plant collector. After years of neglect, the garden was then taken over and restored by the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Berge."

The garden itself is small but beautifully formed, with an exquisite gift shop (all rather out of my price range) packed full of beautiful things to look at. It also has a super bookshop, and the Love posters exhibition. I gather there is a YSL museum opening here next year which would make it even more worth a visit. Very reasonable to get in, but it wont take you long so don't plan to stay here more than an hour."

We went at about 4 p.m. to catch the \"golden hour\" light filtering through the grounds. Then on a drizzly day to capture the muted shading and raindrops off the cacti. Every year, the specimens get more breathtaking. Meticulously tended, it is a delight. And for color, there is nothing as remarkable as the famous \"Majorelle\" blue as a background for the citrus-colored pots and varieties of sculptural catci. The gift shop is dizzyingly expensive (this is the site of YSL's memorial, so expect couturier prices), but you can get a small can of the famous blue paint to take home. The Berber museum on the grounds is also worth a look. And the bookstore (Librerie) has hard-to-locate books of local interest (Lords of the Atlas, in English; Contes et Legendes Populaires du Maroc, in French)."

This was originally the studio of Jacques Majorelle who originally came to Marrakesh from Paris in 1917-in 1923 he decided to live in Marrakesh. He had an artist's studio built in the Art Deco style in 1931.Surrounding the studio he had a garden built composed of rare and exotic plants from all over the world. The garden was abandoned after his death in 1962 and in the 1980's was acquired by Yves Saint Laurent and his partner. The garden was restored and more plants added. In addition to this, there is the addition of the Berber museum-full of jewelry from various tribes in North Africa. Another thing not to be missed is a small gallery of YSL's yearly LOVE artwork.

If you are interested, then you have to go! There is also a fascinating museum on Berber culture, which is worth the additional cost (70/30 drm). The gardens are outside the medina to the north west in the new city - if you don't feel like walking more than 30 minutes to get there then it may be better to get a taxi."

Definitely worth a trip, but annoyed at the fact that they try and make it all so commercial. It's quite tacky to market the deep blue as if Majorelle invented it. It has origins in the natural colors that Moroccans have used for centuries and still do, to color the famous mosaics, the fabrics and leather etc. Don't buy anything in the shop, as it's all branding - taking Moroccan artisanat and adding a brand equals a 3000% addition to the price, of the same items you can find in the souks. On the positive note, there was a great museum with the history of the Imazighen, which was a great surprise. Try the garden caf\u00e9, great surrounding to enjoy a tea or coffee, although the staff are very reserved and don't talk much."

The garden is exceptional, the Berber Museum is FULL of priceless jewellery and clothing from the various tribes, and the gift shop is the best place to acquire Moroccan items that you won't throw out upon returning home. The place was originally created by the painter Marjorelle, then restored by Yves Saint Laurent. There is a small gallery of his yearly LOVE artwork. Be sure to go early enough to also sit in the caf\u00e9 with the well dressed people. Amazing walled garden to sit and admire.

We went as a family of 4 and consider \u00a340 entry very steep for a 20 to 30 minute stroll round a cactus garden with a tiny museum and very expensive souvenir shop to finish. Tea-room/restaurant prices also cater for captive audience so we didn't bother. 2015 lonely planet guide states cost is \u00a37 so at \u00a310 each, prices have been disappointingly hiked up."

I guess this features high on TripAdvisor and that's the reason I chose it ..though none of the locals were guiding me for it ..I just referred to TripAdvisor and upon seeing it as topspot..I had to give it a dash..So we are Indians ..read ( economically poor Indians lolol) ..taking a cab to go all the way and spending more than what we wanted to ..approx 40 dirhams each way ..considering other attractions meant for visitors were pegged at 10 /20 dirhams .This place felt suddenly expensive ..70 dirhams for the garden and a further 5p dirhams if u wanted to check the msuiem.attached .We opted for the gardens as had had enough of museums .Now don't get me wrong .it was pretty and we'll kept and all that ..but heylooo! It looked more like an indoor botanical garden with bonsai trees and pretty alleys and several parisiennes.It looked more like it has been marketed and planned for visits from rich Europeans who can wow wow again and again..No offense ..but it didn't work for us .I rather spend time ambling in the streets of medina and cafes and soaking it all in..Felt really irritated coming here and then whiling time a wee more coz ur supposed to..after all, we spent 70 dirhams each to admire bonsai and click pics...aah;those mandatory pics..Just see the photos and be content ..I wouldn't exhort this place unless u a lover of botany...Just saying....."

I would recommend going earlier in the morning if you want to avoid the influx of tourist buses later in the day. If you are a photo enthusiast, you will be able to grab some really good nature shots with great light and shadow compositions, mixed with a strong theme of blue throughout.It is small and you can cover the garden and the Berber museum within an hour. it is pleasant to hear the constant chirping of birds although the price they charge relative to everything else in Morocco a little bit on the pricier end. 100 dirhams (\u20ac10) per person for access to the garden and the museum with another 100 dirhams in the beautiful caf\u00e9 for two simple drinks."

There is a cafe also, it was wonderful to bask in the sunshine having coffee. The cafe is expensive, we had a lemonade & coffee 80.00 dh = \u00a38.00. The berber museum was interesting, lots of artifacts and costumes to marvel at, the downside was all the information on the walls and cabinets was in French.Allow a couple of hours to meander round this beautiful place.

Both he and his partner bought and rescued this place from being plowed under for a hotel project.It isn't a great big garden, it's in a Marrakech neighborhood, after all. It does display a lot of different desert flora from all over the world. The walkways and garden pools are tranquil and feature Majorelle Blue, which is supposed to be a special shade of blue concocted by St. Laurant's partner.It does house The Berber Museum which is a must see to get a sense of Proto Mediterranean history shoulder to shoulder with the Ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Egyptians. The Berbers still live in the mountains and speak their ancient tongue among themselves but can't write it. Who knew?Spend a few hours at both the Gardens and the Museum. Cost for both per person is $10 and there is a bookstore, boutique, and cafe too. Very nice."

We had just finished an eight day tour of Morocco and had changed our minds regarding travelling for a ninth day and decided to spend a couple of days in Marrakech. Having seen a couple of reviews in tripadvisor and seeing it was within walking distance of our hotel, we walked up to explore. It's not immediately obvious as to it's location. You notice a few horse drawn wagons and petit taxis on the side of the main road and the entrance is down the side-road Rue Yves Saint Laurent. Just look for the ticket booth or the lineup. There isn't much signage, but the locals recognize the confused look of a tourist and are happy to point it out.  We skipped the additional cost of the museum, opting for just the gardens. What a wonderful place. As soon as you step through the gates, you feel your stress float away. You can no longer hear the street on the other side of the wall, the air smells cleaner and you may notice the birds singing. The plants are incredible. I never would have believed I would find such beauty inside a garden of cactus. The palm trees and bamboo provide shading for the walkways and it felt 10 degrees cooler inside the garden. The colours they have chosen for the fountains, planters and benches provide a startling contrast and serve to highlight the plants. It seemed busy, but it never felt crowded. We did have to wait for three other groups of tourists to take their photos before we could take ours in front of the house, but everybody helped each other with photos.  We wandered around for about 1.5 -2 hours and felt much more relaxed for the experience."

I also wanted to see the museum and when we went to buy tickets I found out it was two different prices, pennies for Morrocans and dollars for everyone else. I don.t support that philosophy especially when we are already pouring a lot of tourist dollars into their economy.The garden/museum shop was gorgeous. The prices were very high. I passed items that could have been purchased in any smart boutique."

It is quite small but well worth a visit when if you are in the area. I left this to visit until after a 5 day trek of Mt. Toubkal and the Sahara. Myself and a friend had a free day and although numerous offers of day treks and tours we were not in the humour for more trekking of driving we just wanted to relax after a very busy and amazing 5 day trek. The price was 70 diram (\u20ac7) to enter yhe garden and 30 diram (\u20ac3) to enter the Berber museum. So that's 100 diram (\u20ac10) for both October 2016. I would recommend doing both for definite. After reading reviews on here some were saying the museum only has two rooms and was bot really worth it. No photos allowed in the museum. It has a small entrance lobby, which has a 6 minute movie showing of the history and culture of Berber life and a smaller screen with older black and white footage. Very interesting to see. The two rooms consist of one with the crafts of the Berber people from jewellery to cooking untensils to everyday tools for the different trades they had. Some very detailed work, and what time and skill went into the making of these items. The other room houses an example of all the clothes they wore from bygone times. Some simple to some very detailed. There was also a wall with examples of doors they made for dwellings and they are amazing, I spent awhile just looking at them and examining the work involved in them. One in particular looked like it was a 'work in progress' with lovely detailed art on the top half of the door, carved into the wood with maybe the idea of doing the bottom half at a later stage."

The place itself is lovely however it is very small and mainly overcrowded - it is impossible to find a quiet place to enjoy the garden. I am sorry to say that but the photos on the internet look far better than to experience this place yourself."

Go just to see the gardens of Marrakesh and the Berber \"museum\" is nice although just 3 small rooms of artifacts. The gardens are nice to walk through but unless you truly love gardens, gardening, plants and greenery you will spend 2 hours here, max. That's including the 20-30 minutes you'll spend walking through the museum. However, I had young kids (ages 5 and 10) so their appreciation for the museum was very limited, we just walked the garden pathways and loved some of the animals in the river."

Boutiques sell jewelry and clothes that are less traditional with a western twist. It's not easy to find boutiques in Marrakech, people mostly shop in the souks. Souks are fantastic for rugs, pillow cases, lamps, leather goods, spices but they are not a place to get clothing."

Beautifully designed and a pleasant walk around to see the plants, ponds etc. There are benches all around so you can sit and relax.

And this from civilisations who developed completely separately, thousands of miles apart...very wierd but very cool.Try to visit quite early, or late on in the day if you just want a quick visit...that way you'll avoid the majority of the tour groups,which does change the atmosphere of the gardens a bit! It won't spoil it though...still well worth the visit, for me anyway even the Berber Museum on its own would have been great...and the Gardens are the cherry on the cake! Great little shop and library here as well as a Caf\u00e9 - not cheap but then you do get to sit and drink coffee in the gardens where YSL himself may have sat and relaxed with a coffee himself!"

You've found it, it's the Jardin Majorelle! It's is just beautiful and I'd like to thank the great YSL for such a gift. Go there see/experience it yourself. It's a must if you are in town."

The person selling entrance tickets had no idea how to be polite or smile but the ticket was purchased. Many many well maintained cacti and tropical plants. The atmosphere was very relaxing after the hustle and bustle of the city souks and medina. The Berber museum was a surprising bonus. Not really what I would normally go to look at but a well put together display of interesting exhibits and a magical mirrored room. The cafe was pleasant although the staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. 'Oh you can't buy that now. Only breakfast.' No times on the menu! By the time we left (about 2 hours after arriving) the place was very busy. Coach trips had arrived. Guided tours. Not quite as relaxing. The garden is not huge, but big enough to see without getting too tired. Look out for the turtles. As we left, we were met with a sea of taxi drivers offering their services for a range of fees. We decided to boycott the confusion, walk 100 metres away and got a taxi for a fraction of what we had just been quoted. In conclusion: go early, enjoy and don't let the eager local taxi drivers charge you too much when you leave. Oh and if you want happy smiling courteous staff, don't expect to find them here. The gardens however are lovely."

Although I found it a bit expensive for a small garden (70 durham entrance + 30 if you wanted to go to the Berber museum), it is a beautifully kept garden. There are plants (especially cactus) from all over the world...kinda fun to find some that are familiar. There are paved paths to follow, water features with frogs and turtles, and birds making it a nice break from noisy streets.Others in our group paid the extra for the museum and said it pulled together all we had learned about the Berber culture throughout our tour. Although small, it had great examples of the art and culture."

Visited September 2016 as a couple.Having (stupidly) chosen to walk from the other side of Marrakech in the September heat, the Jardin Majorelle (we'll call them 'gardens' now) was a welcome retreat.Tip: the entrance is located round the side / back of the property, away from the main road You pay an entrance fee to visit, and a separate entrance fee for the Berber museum inside.On entering the gardens you will see a map of the gardens, which you won't need to memorise at all (just note that toilets are near the entrance). The gardens are actually lovely, with different trees and plants and accompanying descriptions in places. There are various water small ponds and benches to marvel at the foliage!Of course the star of the attraction is the house, painted in a luxurious deep blue with yellow highlighted around windows and features. This of course makes for some fantastic photo (or drawing / painting) opportunities, so get creative! There is a small shop, but it's expensive.The berber museum within the house was great, and it worth the extra \"few quid\". The museum showcases tools, clothing, jewelry, and various others items from their living.Overall 4 stars, as I felt the price was steep compared with other attractions / museums / free parks in Marrakech. You are paying for a piece of YSL history, but it was worth it really."

It was quite a walk, which for a pair of healthy 30 somethings wasn't too bad, just had some throbbing feet by the time we returned back to our Riad. The good news is that once you are at the Gardens it is a lovely place to be. Certainly cooler in temperature than the rest of the area. While it may look like there isn't much there, the dDisplays are beautifully laid out and there is plenty to discover and look at as you meander through. During our visit the Berber museum was closed while a new exhibit was being installed. The cafe looked reasonably priced, and the toilets were good and clean (take some small change for a tip to the attendee). My only advice would be to watch out for young men lurking outside who try and befriend you as leave, they are very charming and try to show you around the New Town markets, which conveniently lead to a families rug shop... then request a tip for their guidance. We spotted this before we got to the shop, and palmed him off with small change."

It's unimaginable that something so beautiful and precious was considered for destruction so that another hotel resort could replace it. It's a beautiful place to spend a day in, if you have the luxury of time - walk around, admire the wondrous fauna and flora from all around the world, dine in the cool surrounds of the garden cafe (everything on the menu that I ordered was a hit!), shop in the indoor gift shop, visit the YSL memoriam or, just sit under a shaded tree and unwind."

There's no real explanation as to the link between yves saint laurent and this garden which is confusing but there's a memorial there and some of his artwork which is cool to see.Overall it's a pretty place that makes for some nice photographs and for 70dirham is worth a visit if you have a lot of time.

Unfortunately the Berber Museum was closed which was dissapointing but perhaps I shall have to visit again. Entry to garden was 70 dirhams, and the Museum would have been 30 dirhams. Usual for Europe but expensive for Morocco, definitely worth it. There were lots of glamorous looking women taking selfies but who can blame them with such an irresistible backdrop? (I was one of the less glamorous ones!)"

Majorelle is only about a 10 minute taxi ride from the big mosque in the Medina. Try flag a taxi down rather than approach a waiting one as you will pay less. We only paid 17 dh to the gardens.It was lovely to walk through the garden and see a different side of Marekech.Very relaxing but hot place I suggest you take water with you as buying it at the cafe is quite expensive 30 dhs for a large bottle. Wander around the garden at leisure lots of great photo opportunities.Museum was closed when I visited not sure why ?Entrance fee is 70 dh per adult and 30 dh to museum ( if it was open).When leaving there is a queue of taxis waiting. If you want the cheap option turn right on exiting garden and walk to main road and flag a taxi. Great postcards for sale from vendor outside exit."

Full of trees, shrubs, and plants from around the world, the gardens provide shade, cool, and fresh air. It's peaceful with a couple of Koi ponds, as well. Do visit the Berber museum within the gardens (an additional ticket is necessary). You'll need to take a taxi from the medina. We easily agreed on a roundtrip fare with a driver, making for a smooth excursion."

As an adult I was very interested in the plants and which part of the world they were from, so spent time reading the information on offer. My teenagers were less interested and found it repetitive, and dull. It's worth a visit and is reasonably priced. Make sure your flash works on your camera as the natural lighting inside the garden is limited and some of the best photo opportunities are in dark areas."

It is a standing testimony to love : the love that Jacques Majorelle had for his art & for Marrakech, and the love that Yves Saint Laurent shared with Pierre Berg\u00e9 for the Berber culture and the garden which no doubt inspired the palette of the designs that came out of Yves Saint Laurent Couture House. This is an attraction that you must visit when you are in Marrakech. An additional fee is required to view the Berber collection and although it is a small collection, it is impressive."

There are plenty of flowers and a few species of wild birds be seen, as well as the bright blue buildings which characterise the gardens.There is a book store and very expensive fashion boutique in the gardens as well as a museum. We grabbed a coffee in the picturesque onsite cafe which is set in a courtyard. We were tempted to order food as well but settled for just drinks. Prices were a little high for Marrakech but normal by European standards and worth it for the pretty surroundings."

Surrounded by high walls you wouldn't be able to tell with the many different trees and plants from all over the world. Designed by Yves Saint Laurent himself the garden does have beauty and mystery. There are plenty of places to sit and contemplate (assuming there are not many visitors) and a great place to take pictures of plants you would otherwise never see. The most attractive place in the garden is the pond in the centre which is still water covered with lily pads. Take your time to view the garden and the house as the calm and relax atmosphere helps to revive you until you leave and join the traffic laden, smog filled, persistent harassment of Marrakech roads! Definitely worth the trip and of course recomended for all."

We were there no more than an hour but from there reviews people had said two hours, which is well over estimated. Not much around here but if you have lunch I'd recommend eating inside the gardens in the beautiful surroundings as the ones outside are pretty average. When entering the gardens there is two prices, which caught us by surprise as on trip advisor it says the local rate. One rate for the Moroccans (40dr) and one rate for tourists (70dr). Nice place to chill, see some amazing plants and take some nice pictures. Not somewhere I'd visit again but if you're in Gueliz then pop in. "

Its about \u00a33 in a taxi to get to it. located in the north of marrakech, and i would not advise walking to it as it is outside of the city walls, where it is extremely busy. Its just a garden thats very peaceful and with beautiful decor. you can also pay a little more to visit to museum there which shows the life of the nomads and the morrocan people through the centuries. have a great holiday!"

Unfortunately, we went in the middle of the day and it was pretty busy. It seems like everyone there needed a personal photo shoot of themselves looking into the distance in front of the iconic blue walls. If you're a polite person, this means you're pausing every ten paces so a dutiful husband--while balancing a purse under his arm--can finish snapping photos of his lady. It opens at 8, go early.Another tip: there is no special \"tariff\" for taking a taxi from the gardens. There's a que directly outside the gardens and were told it was 5\u20ac back to our hotel (in the medina about 1.3 km away) because they have to pay to wait there. As we chuckled and walked away the price was cut in half."

The Berber museum is interesting but a little on the small side with effectively 3 rooms of artefacts to see. One of these rooms is darkened with ceiling lights and mirrors clearing a starlit sky effect.What I would recommend is the cafe in the gardens, a tranquil ambience with cool sprays of water and a good selection of food and drinks."

It was wonderful, everything to myself and the gardeners watering the plants. When you get there this early you can watch the turtles and frogs in the ponds. At about 9:30am it was like busloads of visitors arrived and it was impossible to enjoy the tranquility like before.My advise; get there early! Perfect way to start the day!"

The synthetic shade of blue contrasts so wonderfully with the natural greens and dusty oranges of the gardens and you'll be sure to come away with the most beautiful holiday snaps to the envy of all your friends. It's basically instagram heaven. Yves Saint Laurent certainly knew what he was doing when he designed these gardens.The gardens are big: you can meander round for over an hour, gazing into the pools and exploring the winding paths. There are lots of beautiful vistas and exotic plants to catch your eye and the location is very peaceful and serene out of the way of the main city centre."

Some people are disappointed by it, being used to contemporary gardens of today. However, when you realise when it was designed and created, it was well in advance of its time!This garden is a true oasis in the city, and worth giving yourself at least 2 \u2013 3 hours to really enjoy it, along with the museum and cafe.The Berber Museum is the best presented in Marrakech, high lighting the wonderful costumes and jewellery of the Berber people throughout Morocco. Definitely not to be missed!The cafe is a lovely place to spend a lunch or snack, cool tranquil and relatively inexpensive.From experience, the quietest time to visit the gardens is between 12.30 and 2.30 when everyone is having lunch."

It was my second time in Jardin Majorelle, I visit it very quickly because of the heat and the tourists, and I do recommend if one comes in August like me should definitely visit in the morning as early as possible. I wanted to go to the Berbere museum situated in the old Jacques Majorelle Atelier and the Memorial Yves Saint Laurent, but I didnt go in because of these factors. However, even just visiting briefly i can say that this garden is a unique feast for the eyes. It is an attraction one cant miss if one wants to understand Yves Sain Laurent artistic heritage."

So make sure to bring your own water bottle.Overall, it is a must visit here in Marrakech ."

The cost to gain entry is 70 dh for the gardens plus 30 dh for the Berber museum which is a must if you want to learn more about the Berber people of Morocco. The gardens are kept in a superb condition and are a selfie lovers dream. Beautiful viewpoints are at every turn. The colour of the cobalt blue is truly magnificent. You can purchase the paint in the gift shop alongside many expensive items of quality designed by the gardens creative designer. The staff are very polite and there is a beautiful courtyard cafe to have a coffee and a bite to eat. I recommend the club sandwich. Toilets in the this location and kept to a high standard. You must visit the museum where you will see the finest examples of Berber clothing textiles and jewellery anywhere in the world. I wish I could recreate this beautiful environment in my own garden back home in the uk."

Gardens are generally pleasant to visit, but there is nothing special about this one, so use your time and money to visit other much more impressive gardens in the city, such as the Mamounia's. In Majorelle, they built bamboo fences throughout the place that ruin the view, glass would have integrated much better with the greens. It is generally small and doesn't feel particularly Moroccan. We didn't mind that there weren't a lot of areas to sit and relax because we didn't see a reason to spend much time there. Because it's small and they allow a lot of people at any given time, it is even hard to take a photo of something you like without strangers in the background. The museum is very small and all in French (French is fine for me, but for others they had to see the English explanations when entering a room and hope to remember which artifacts each portions referred to!). The coffee shop is nice, though a bit overpriced.NOTE: If you take a taxi, don't be surprised if the driver tries to drop you a couple of blocks before arriving at the actual gardens, in a busy 4-lane road you need to cross without a traffic light. At the start when you agree on a price, also make sure he agrees to drop you right in front."

The beautiful gardens provide great photos, and there is also a lovely little cafe situated inside which sprays light water to cool down if sat outside which is welcomed.

Otherwise 70 plus 30 for the museum to enter pp. Staff are friendly and offered to take photos of us so full length shots looked great against the vibrant colours. We did tip one as he captured some beautiful shots of us and spent a good ten minutes expressing his skills The mixed cacti has inspired a new garden area for us.Not much to do for children and the area is not huge so needs to be something of interest to you in order to enjoy."

You can't really miss this based on the fact that every guide to Marrakech includes it somewhere in the itinerary, but - coming from someone who doesn't yet think of himself as a green-fingered garden-lover - it was well worth the visit and a welcome break from the sun. And as almost the entire garden is under the canopy of trees and sky-reaching flora, it is wonderfully cool and really hardly something that anyone in their right mind can complain about. Unless you prefer the 43-degree heat lurking outside the garden walls."

It was easy to find and cost 100 Dirham to get in to see the gardens plus the Berber museum. I'm not sure what I was expecting but what I found and saw was certainly more than I imagined. The gardens are beautiful and were a really calm shaded walk and the Berber museum, which I think I am right in saying had some interior design/layout input from YSL himself, was much more than I imagined. Rather than be a small number of rooms simply full of artefacts, the layout and design of the decor definitely took it up a notch and the jewellery room was awesome. The Love Gallery where you'll find exhibits of the annual postcards YSL sent to friends is cool and I purchased a souvenir book with copies of each postcard inside. The amazing blue house itself is well worth seeing in person as the photos don't do it justice! I was tempted to buy a pot of the \"Majorelle Blue\" paint sold in the boutique shop after seeing it! I had a small salad plus mint tea in the gardens cafe which was also good."

The only real value in this attraction is that it is different from anything else you're going to see in Marrakesh. The YSL memorial was disappointing. Also, the place is far from the city center so you need to take a taxi there. Next time I'd go to Bahia palace instead."

After paying to get in I was expecting something spectacular, and can only say I was massively disappointed. I understand people perceive it to be an oasis of calm from the streets of Marrakech, but you can also get that in the Cyber Park and other large park areas near the Koutubia Mosque and those parks have wonderful fruit trees, lawned areas, plants and fountains as well as being able to get a drink of tea from a tea seller. The tourist status of this place also means its busy. An oasis of calm for me is not sitting on a seat watching a train of people photographing a plant pot. There is a paved path which leads through the gardens. It passes some large terracotta plant pots roughly painted and poorly planted, why anyone would paint a terracotta plant pot orange was lost on me.....and my 6 year old niece could have done a neater job of managing not to paint the plant leaves as well as the pots. The planting lacked ideas and inspiration. Its just wholly underwhelming. Not at all worth the trip, time would be much better spent having some tea in a beautiful riad. "

The entrance was a bit pricey for what was there but it was a great experience and we love fashion and design so it was special for us.Don't forget to buy your tin of Majorelle Blue paint...

Also, there is a superb shop that sells YSL paraphernalia and even majorette blue paint! I got a little can but still have not used it. There is a little Berber museum there as well, and a garden cafe. The date/almond/avocado/honey smoothie I had there was amazing and I have tried to replicate it.

The garden is quite small and could be walked around easily in 15 minutes, however there were plenty of spaces for quiet contemplation and the gardens themselves were beautifully maintained.We didn't pay for the museum as I don't really have much knowledge or interest in YSL's work so can't comment on the value for money for that but in my opinion the garden wasn't worth the money compared to many that I've been to for free throughout the world.In addition to the gardens and museum there are also water stands and a cafe / restaurant which serves hotel priced food.Would I recommend you go?

My wife and I stepped into the Jardin Majorelle one hot (110 F) July day to find the gardens beautiful, the atmosphere tranquil, and the coolness of the shade sublime. We spent over 3 hours in the gardens taking pictures, drawing flowers while sitting on a bench listening to the frogs, perusing the museum, and eating a light lunch in the garden cafe.The gardens themselves are breathtaking - and surprisingly cool, thanks to the abundance of shade and water. The gardens provide a beautiful contrast to the Medina outside: from Majorelle's blue compared to the red city outside, or from the quiet chirping of the Garden's frogs compared to the hustle of the Souks outside. The Museum was small - just three rooms, but by far the best laid out museum we have visited in Marrakech and definitely worth a look. The cafe is also very good - and priced similarly to other tourist destinations in Marrakech (we ordered a salad, sandwich and ice cream for around 200 MAD). Visit the gardens, bring a camera and a sketch book, and take your time... breathing in the beauty... soaking in the tranquility... and living in the sublime."

It felt like it had been created around the area that was already there rather than destroying the land and building up again.I absolutely love water features, bridges and tall trees so I couldn't stop staring and taking it all in. It's very rare to be standing in a busy garden/park and still feel calm and peaceful like I did there.I would say this might not be for everyone, it's mostly about appreciating design and architecture rather than physically taking part in any activities or playing on open grass, so it may not be the best place to take young children.Some advice: the restaurant was overpriced without justification. There were a few places to eat just outside the gate that were relatively cheaper but still overpriced for what they served. This is becase the garden is slightly isolated from the city. I would eat before visiting the garden :)"

However, this YSL garden was extraordinary. It was an oasis of unique foliage, a perfectly designed garden. I loved buying a small can of Indigo Blue paint to bring home, the same color as the home of YSL. A museum honoring YSL is currently being built next door to the Jardin Majorelle. Should open in 2017."

The restaurant there is very good, serving a good array of food and drinks. The park itself is absolutely stunning, the majorelle blue makes for a good background for photos. There is a very popular photo spot on the outside of the main building, so try to take your pictures fast(there was always someone waiting). Overall it was a nice stop, but don't expect to spend more than 45 minutes to an hour."

I would recommend coming here, it's a nice escape from the loudness of the rest of the city. It was owned by the late Yves Saint Laurent, so its history is interesting. It provides a lot of shade, so I would recommend coming in the mid afternoon because it doesn't get overly hot and it's not too crowded."

I would recommend going early because the gardens are popular but small so not only do you have to wait to pay admission when its crowded, but also it gets full inside. Still, it is well worth it, especially if you are interested in plants. Additionally, the Museum on the grounds is small but amazing: a video presentation with excellent information, an exhibit of Berber jewelry that is incredible - both the quality of the jewelry but also the way it is exhibited. Another part of the museum shows indigenous clothing from various parts of Morocco - fascinating. A small alcove outside has original posters from Yves St. Laurent which he sent as New Years cards through the years. Lastly, there is a boutique with gorgeous leather handbags and other items."

We were pleasantly surprised to discover that our preconceived notions were wrong.The gardens are gorgeous with so many different plants and flowers from all over the world. The vivid colors of the buildings made fun backdrops for vacation photos. There's a great little cafe in the middle of the garden where were stopped for tea and dessert (and to lament that we did not each lunch there instead of at the Four Seasons pool restaurant). There's also a gift shop of extremely overpriced trinkets (think USD$350 for a silver bracelet NOT designed by YSL).Definitely a must!"

It's not your typical garden but it is magnificent and so peaceful even with the hordes of tourists walking up and down the paths. The water features are lovely and the Berber exhibit in the museum is fascinating along with the spectacular jewelry. Not my taste but I can certainly appreciate the workmanship. There is a history to this garden which pays homage to Yves Saint Laurent and there is a memorial to the designer. Also under construction is a new museum opening in the fall. I couldn't get any information about what would be in the new museum but would certainly love to visit the garden and museum again in the future."

Situated in the new town off marrakesh, these small and quite discrete garden has a link to one the most recognised designers in history, yves saint laurent :-)Just a quick insight its history, Jardin Majorelle was a french orientalist painter and son of the famous Art Nouveau designer, Louis Majorelle. While living in Marrakesh, in 1931 he commissioned the architect Paul Sinoir to build an artist studio in the art deco style with the walls painted the \"Majorelle Blue\" surrounding it with plants from his travels arcoss the globe. After his death in 1962 the garden fell into abandon. In 1980 Pierre Berge and Yves Saint Laurenta acquired the Jardin Majorelle. After Yves's death in 2008 Pierre Berge donated the Jardin Majorelle to the foundation Pierre Berge - Yves Saint Laurent. A memorial for the legendary designer is at the Jardin :-) For price, its very cheap to visit with a separate cost for families too. It has the museum, cafe and a small art gallery within the facility. Personal, I think its wonderful :-)"

Don't miss the Mus\u00e9e Berb\u00e8re, small museum but so rich and beautiful - and look at the books in the library. Simply all together a lovely place to enjoy, alone, with family and friends..."

You don't need a long time here as the place was rather small as it was only the garden of late Yves Saint Lauren which was converted to a garden for public to see. There were loads of exotic cacti in the garden which were really interesting and fascinating if you were into gardening and plants. I found the journey quite interesting as there was a water stream in the middle. There was also a corner where you can see the paintings and arts made by YSL (love corner). His memorial was also inside the garden, you will surely not miss it. There will be gentlemen in blue tops who worked for the garden that would tell you where to go and would monitor what you would do in case you decided to take a photo close to the cacti which wasn't allowed. I got told off by stepping on garden ground LOL. The museum inside the garden would take you back to their ancestry, cultures and traditions which were very informative. The costumes were very fascinating so as the jewellery corner. It was great photo location too but be very mindful as it got crowded because the place was rather small so you have to be very patient to take a best photo. Otherwise it was a good place to visit and to know a little bit more about Marrakech."

Berbers had little to do with garden origins or design, so not sure why it was there. Cafe was extortionate, average juices poorly served (in what appear to be half-pint glasses from 1980's Britain). Was \u00a310 for this privilege. Would recommend going first thing when is quieter (although during Ramadan this isn't possible), but as with anywhere these days the proliferation of cameraphones meant not a single sight could be appreciated without gaggles of people taking pictures of themselves next to it and you feeling like you're in their way.

We had lunch plans elsewhere but we ended up staying and eating in the Jardin's cafe. The food was lovely and the age courtyard is refreshingly cool and very pretty. There is so much to take in at Jardin Majorelle. Put it at the top of things to do whilst in Marrakech."

It's more serene first thing in the morning with the enormous bamboo swaying gently in the ever so slight breeze and the gorgeous greens of the plants, the lighting and shadows make a feast for the eyes. The vivid colours of the entrance, pots and the few other buildings are eye catching and en vogue. Yves Saint Laurent certainly did a beautiful thing for the city when he dedicated this to Marrakech. It's an artist landscaped garden mixing the orient with the west - an oasis and a complete contrast to the bustling souks and hot streets of the city. I didn't visit the Berber Museum which is tucked away inside however the art exhibition from YSL is worth a glance and leaves you wondering more about this infamous fashion icon. Beautiful quality wares in the shop, well made but a little out of my budget. Highly Recommend a visit. It cost 70 dnh per person (2016) Open 9am-5pm daily"

A good way to spend an hour or so in a shady setting when the sun is hot.I suspect this attraction may not be very suitable for active children as there are narrow paths and different surface levels.To be able to enjoy the huge species of cacti when I returned home, I took a photo of the planting and a photo of the plant drawing and explanation.

The fresh juices were refreshing, the lunch menu was appealing, we ordered a club sandwich and fries which was tasty, the deserts were delish.

From the moment we entered, there was an almost mystical feeling about how a garden should make you feel ... transported away from the cares of the everyday world. The minimalist use of strong colors in just the right places; the mix of lush palms and succulents with dense areas of bamboo; unobtrusive benches inviting you to sit and soak it in; small ponds; even the memorial for Yves St Laurant tucked away quietly in a part of the garden. It all blended beautifully for a deliciously lovely escape from the city outside. The small museum on the grounds is well worth a visit. A tasteful mix of photos, video and artifacts tell of Berber life. Before you leave, go into the patio cafe for a delicious juice and maybe a decadent crepe."

The house is stunning and the lapis lazuli blue colouring everywhere is something to marvel at.

I loved the use vibrant colours used on the pots and walls. There is also a small gallery of some of the card YSL created which is worth going to see as well as the museum focusing on the history of the Berbers. We ate lunch here which was very tasty if not a little more expensive than the restaurants and caf\u00e9s back in the medina but that was OK, we were on holidays.

It's a fairly nice garden. Not incredible, not fantastic, not amazing or special out outlandish. 5 stars it isn't.What it *is* is a fairly small (probably 5 minutes walking if you didn't stop) garden full of a stream and some small ponds (which are slightly overfilled with goldfish) which have blue kerbs around the edges, and a blue house. The garden contains a lot of cacti with varying degrees of info signs telling you their names and countries of origin. There's also a museum dedicated, it would seem, to Yves Saint Laurent. We didn't visit that because we're not really fans - though there is also half a pillar in the garden as a monument to him. The most interesting part of the garden, by far, was a slightly ageing British woman and her American consort taking photos (complete with pretentious \"hold the light meter up\" pose) with her skirt pulled up practically to her armpits while their Moroccan guide tried not to laugh. Unfortunately for everyone who didn't make it today, I don't think they're a regular fixture. If this garden were free, it would probably merit 3 stars. As it is, it's a fair walk across some lethal dual carriageways filled with kamikaze motorbike riders to get to a garden that costs 70 MAD each to enter in order to look at a few plants. Save your money, go to Kew or similar when you get home, and enjoy something Moroccan while you're in Morocco."

As I wondered around the gardens drinking in all the delights on offer my eyes were captivated by the eye catching, vivid blues and the creamy yet striking yellows adorning the ceramics and brick work. The groundsmen are truly a testament to the fabled owners, the elegant chic that Yves Saint Laurent evoked in his work is transient in the artwork of nature."

The combination of plant variety (bamboo to cacti) and a thoughtful layout makes it feel like you are not surrounded by a huge throng of tourists. From a photography standpoint, there is not a lot here to shoot - frogs on lily pads, that kind of thing, but they are tri-pod friendly if you reassure them you are amateur.A highlight was the little cafe, complete with misters and sun filters to keep you cool.The gift shop is pricey even by US standards but they have some really nice things.If you have a couple days in the city, I can't imagine this would not end up on your list."

The Riad suggested going early And also going into the Berber museum, both were great recommendations!!The gardens do get busy, but were beautiful to have a wander around and admire the planting and also the beautiful blue painted on the hard landscaping.The Berber museum isn't huge, but worth having a look and taking time to read the descriptions of everything. The clothing / costumes were so intricate and the jewellery was amazing to look at too.Really lovely gift shop too - no tat, all very classy but with prices to match. Certainly worth a look. There is going to be a YSL museum in times to come and I am sure this will just make the whole site even more busy.Enjoy."

My husband and I were happy to learn the history that such gardens in disrepair were rescued from being leveled. There are huge cactus and Bamboo forests, palms, willows all plants were gathered from Jacques Majorelle's travels around the world, and the dead bamboo is then converted into fencing at the Gardens. There's a small Berber cultural museum that totally authentic and matched what we saw and learned in nearby cities. Berber clothing, wraps, instruments Etc. Wonderful. We arrived late so went through the museum quickly and then strolled through the gardens. There are also some lithographs that Yves St Laurent drew. The place is an oasis of calm in the middle of a hectic paced Marrakech. Go there !!"

Well worth the taxi+long queue outside to reach it. They are going to open a YSL museum next year so it will make the trip even more worth.A few problems that prevent me to recommend the garden to everybody:1) it's much smaller than I imagined! Consider spending here at most 30min, and it will be plenty of time to explore the garden. If you are thinking of Versailles-size gardens, you'll be sorely deluded2) There are not enough indication of which plant/tree is which. There are a few signposts for the cactus only but they aren't very clear (if you go, you'll see what I mean). I would have loved more informationsSo from the point of view of a botanic, they are less interesting than you could expect. For everybody else, it's by far the best attraction in Marrakech. I loved the colonial feeling you get here, the quiet and the shops inside and around it with local artists' pieces and products on sale. The YSL New Year's painting are amazing and alone worth the ticket. Do not miss this place, just be aware of the size and lack of informations."

I do or know whether it is always like this or we choose the wrong timing (before noon), but it was very crowded and full of tourists (I had to wait in order to take nice enough pictures). The entrance fee is 70dhs only for the garden and 30dhs on top for the museum. The place is very small and I assume the entrance fee is that high just because the garden had previously belonged to Yves Saint Laurent (there is a memorial of him in the garden). The museum consists of three rooms and the only thing that is worth is the room with jewelry of the Berber women- you can see that part of YSL work is influenced by them. In general I will say that either you should choose different time to visit the garden (when it is not that crowded) or just skip it as it is nothing special (you better visit the cyber garden which is public and much bigger)."

A good idea to get here is with a cab, try to get the price fixed on 40 dirham and make a deal the the taxi driver to pick you up on a certain time for the same price.

It is not expensive to visit jardin majorelle AT ALL - it's 70dh which is about \u00a34 and if you have a valid student card it actually goes down to 35dh which is about \u00a32. I wouldn't recommend paying extra to go in the museum - we didn't and didn't feel like we missed out - unless Yves Saint Laurent really interests you, as the gardens, boutiques and cafe are beautiful and interesting enough on their own.The garden itself is gorgeous - people who complain it's 'just blue paint and cacti' are clearly very negative people who maybe visited on a very negative day - it is lots of blue paint and cacti but it's also bright flowers, ponds, fountains, bridges, tunnels of plants, tall palm trees with splashes of yellow and red and blue throughout - all of which together makes this stunning place 100% worth visiting. The little shops aren't that expensive - I bought the jardin majorelle edition of Letters to Yves for only 90dh (about \u00a35). The cafe IS expensive by Marrakech standards - however you don't NEED to go in there, but I would recommend as it was beautiful and the juices and salads were delicious. A Moroccan salad, fruit salad and two homemade juices came to 285dh (\u00a320). This isn't somewhere you should miss, even if you end up not loving it, you only paid \u00a32-4 so hardly a massive loss. "

We were mesmerized by the beauty of the plants, mainly cacti, flowering and not, but you would expect that with the dry land that is Morocco, and the time and effort put into this precise garden. The bright colours of the pots only add to the magnificence of this garden. We had tea at the cafe and sat listening to the birds. A little oasis if you're tired of the hustle and bustle outside."

The Yves St. Laurent memorial is here, although it's very small and the least colorful thing there. There's also a few ponds filled with koi, frogs and turtles. It's not very big, but it's worth a nice stroll in the shade. Outside is the Berber museum which has an extra cost. We didn't get to check that out tho. There's a row of fabulous shops (pricey tho) before arriving to the entry. Don't be fooled by the taxi drivers outside! Some will charge you double! Remember what you paid to get there or ask your hotel or riad what a standard price should be. Never forget, like all things in Morocco, even taxi rides are negotiable."

The berber museum is nice, but the atmosfeer is a bit strange: no nice welcome but a big set of rules: no pictures, be quiet, wait, not to many people in the museum etc. All this gave our experience a strange negative vibe and we couldn't enjoy the museum that much. If the people working there would loosen up (honour the YSL spirit alive) this museum would be much nicer. JM is worth the visit, an entrance ticket is MAD 70 and MAD 30 for the museum."

Also, the garden is quite small so you might end up spending more time to get there and back than inside...The price is a bit steep: 70 dirhams (about 7 euros). The pathways are narrow so it gets cramped pretty easily, especially if groups take turns snappin g pictures in front of cacti and such.I recommend it for people who stay in Marrakech for a long period. it's not worth the detour if you're there for a day or two."

The cacti are amazing, they mainly come from Mexico. There is some wonderful examples and about this time of year many are beginning to flower. There are little areas where you can sit and just contemplate, although there are other visitors, it is surprisingly quiet. There is a memorial to Yves Saint Laurent who bought the garden along with Pierre Berge who saved the garden from destruction. This garden should certainly be opn every ones itenary."

They were a delightful respite from the rest of Marrakesh. If you are staying in the Medina, they are not reachable on foot. We took a cab. Our hotelier said 15 dh for the three of us, but we agreed to 30, remembering that that's about $3. The cab stand coming back was a harder negotiation, so we paid 50 dh. We were very happy to see turtles and frogs and to hear an orchestra of birdsong in addition to the fabulous trees and flowers. As stated in my title, we stopped at the cafe for a coffee and banana split at about 2:30 pm. The waiter seemed unhappy that's all we wanted, and we did find an \"error\" on the bill, which is never endearing."

The back story is fascinating: Yves Saint Laurent renovates the old home of artist Majorelle and makes it a must visit in Marrkech. The garden contains plants from all over the world -- and also a memorial to YSL. Several ponds contain turtles and koi and the local kids were excited by that. The Berber Museum is really interesting too, but can only be entered with a separate ticket (30 dirhams for non-Moroccans). The shop has lovely pieces of jewelry, clothing, leather etc on offer but at very high prices. There is also a book and photography shop which has some interesting offerings. Thei garden is quite popular and there are loads of drivers etc outside waiting for their groups. Perhaps the best time to visit is early in the AM. Quite a relief from the chaos of the medina."

There is some dispute with what the website and attraction says (open 8 am?) versus what the local riad owners tell tourists (9 am?)... regardless we lucked out because there was a giant group of school children leaving just about the time we got there (10 am). Other than that there was nothing to raise an eyebrow at with the gardens. It is a beautiful, shady, cool place (so much so that I think it would even be bearable during the heat of the day). We walked around a couple times without looking at the map and found paths we hadn't already taken. There tends to be A LOT of posing by tourists for photos, though, so come prepared to be patient if you're seeking great photos."

For some reason we never got there until the last day of our 3-night trip, but it was so worth it.The gardens are absolutely beautiful and an oasis of calm in the hectic city of Marrakech. You are shaded from the sun in the vegetation of the gardens and surrounded by beautiful plants and flowers. The gardens are immaculately maintained. Colourful pots are dotted around and the beautiful blue house makes for stunning photo backdrop. 30 minutes would be a good time to spend in the gardens, although up to an hour if lunching. Also I imagine at peak times there will be a wait for a photo opportunity outside the blue house where everyone seemed to gather.I'd say the entrance fee was on the high side at 70DIR per person compared to any other attractions we visited. The same is to be said about the cafe for lunch (I wouldn't eat there again). We didn't visit the Berber museum.We followed Google maps to find our way to the gardens by foot. This was approximately 35minute walk from the Jema El Fna square through the souks and local markets (part of this route was not so nice to the eye). On our way back we took a much longer route; taking our time walking back through Gueliz neighbourhood (the new town). This was a good walk back and you can find the modern shopping centres with high street stores and starbucks along the way. There are also bars and cafe on the route to stop for a drink (also alcoholic!)."

How compact it was meant that anytime you wished to take a picture there was bound to be someone with a camera or 7 crowding the walkway. I was kitted out with my camera too, but some people to hold up the smooth flow of traffic with photo-taking. The cafe was in a lovely area of the garden. The design, colours and craftsmanship is next to none. I enjoyed it, but would say that there are better parks and gardens in Marrakesh. The Berber museum was very informative, but again because of queues they are happy enough to show you the exit. High star rating because it is beautiful, but wouldn't be high up on my list of to do's in Marrakesh."

Contrast of line, shape and texture of the cacti against the brilliant colour of the bougainvillea and that amazing blue colour that draws the whole garden together iOS a real delight."

And such a rush for your senses after the constants faded reds and browns of the rest of the city. Do go. But enjoy the garden with your eyes more that through your phone camera lens. Please!"

So many different forms, colours and creations, you will be wowed when you turn a corner and find yourself in a totally different zone, like night and day. Yves St Laurent memorial garden is also here. Some areas are out of bounds, should you stroll where you are not allowed you will be gently asked to go back, it's hard to pay attention to the signs when you are surrounded by so much beauty. Bamboo groves where you see so many different types! A real experience, not to be missed! There were turtles in a fountain, a cat in the cacti garden, and birds elsewhere. A MUST DO!!!"

We had to queue and paid around \u00a36 to get in but the queue went quite quickly. Inside it is cool and calming and nice to sit on a bench in the shade. The plants are architectural but don't be tempted to vere off the set pathways as you will be told off! Not sure why Yves Saint Laurent has a memorial there - i think he spent a lot of time in the area - but it's cool."

Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Berg\u00e9 saved this site form falling apart and being taken over by developers back in the seventies and rightly so. Now this wonderful garden sits in a nice part of town and showcases Morrocco and Africa's best specimen of cacti, palm and hot weather hardies. Of course the cleanliness and order are outstanding once you step into this YSL world and it makes you appreciate why order is so important to us mortals: it is utterly calming.And yet this god of fashion has shown us how to appreciate the simpler things in life and one that he only came in contact with when he was here, in Marrakesh, to switch off: NATURE. At the end of your reflective and colourful tour of this Majorelle garden, you will be happy to alight in the caf\u00e9 there, where the charming staff are totally devoted to your comfort. Woe betide the scantily dressed women though, as generally, in the Muslim world they are considered a joke and what's more, of lose morals and thus fair game. But my husband was ill and the waiters plied us with care and hot tea until the driver of the hotel arrived and journeyed us back to our room. Nevertheless, a detour from the Medina you MUST experience when in Marrakesh. And don't miss the exquisitely presented Berber museum under HM Mohammed VI high patronage. This really gives you an unspderstanding of the true nature of Africa's most original tribalsThe city is so grateful, they named the road on which the garden and museum stands, the Rue Yves Saint Laurent. Need I say more?.."

Also at 70d I think it is a little over priced for the size of it, I think you are really paying a YSL premium here. It is also quite a way out of the main city so perhaps it's better to take a cab.

Really nice photos to be had and the museum about the history of the Berber people should not be missed as it sets context to many of the items, clothes and jewellery you see for sale accros the city. Not to be missed. The boutique inside is more Yves St Laurent and the prices match but I am still dreaming about the lovely blue handbag I saw. It's all about and hour's walk from the centre of the medina and this was part of the day out. The cafes and boutiques around this attraction are more cosmopolitan but still good value for money."

What should not be missed is the Berber Museum, which houses their personal collection of Berber artifacts \u2013 clothing, jewelry, textiles, carvings, etc. As one of our companions remarked, she wished that she had seen the museum at the beginning of our trip rather than the end, because she would have appreciated what we had seen so much more.

Unfortunately that wasn't the case.On arrival I was surprised to find that the garden was very small and the museum was charged for separately. You can walk around the whole garden in less than 10 minutes. The restaurant looks very beautiful although I didn't eat there. In terms of the plants, many were damaged as visitors had etched their names into the bark which in my eyes ruined the experience. If a garden doesn't protect the plants they exhibit then it really depreciates it's value.In summary, Le Jardin Majorelle exhibits hardly a shadow of the beauty that can be found in other local gardens such as those in the wonderful La Mamounia hotel and the Jardin D'Agdal. I would not visit again and would suggest the management take a recess to consider how to reinvigorate the garden with the class and attention it deserves."

Then entry to the worthwhile thing, the Berber museum, is an extra 30! While I expect to pay this price elsewhere, all the other museums in Marrakesh are 10 dirhams to get in and some of the Berber wear is found at the dar si said museum where you can take photos. The garden is kind of small with many cactuses and lots of bamboo. There are much larger free gardens with wifi closer to the center of town. The Berber museum was worthwhile, but you cannot choose to so this on its own and will cost you 100 dirham for entrance. The wears inside include 3 small rooms crammed with a nice display and small amount of history about the Berber people of Morocco. Photos not allowed and strictly enforced. In summary, decide if you need to go out of your way for an average attraction with articles seen elsewhere."

This was one of the pricier places we visited (70 dirhams for the garden and 30 for the museum). Wow, that's a whole $10 US! The restaurant is upscale and also expensive by Marrakech standards, but the food is excellent. Stay out of the gift shop or you will be dropping serious $$$, but do visit the gardens!

Given that only one ticket window was open, this woman's personal call meant we had to wait 30 minutes in line to enter the garden. Worst of all, the garden's website clearly lists a discounted entrance fee for employees of NGOs. We pulled up the webpage to show the woman, but she was too busy on her personal call to look at it. She just kept shaking her head and talking away to her friend. Unbelievable."

What we enjoyed most, and they charge separately for, is the Berber Museum at the transformed Jacques Majorelle's old painter studio. Pierre Berg\u00e8 (Yves Saint-Laurent's partner) amassed a greatly curated small collection of Berber items. Gathered during stays at the \"home away from home\" in Morocco. The room with the jewelry display is quite something. The cafe seemed nice, but we did not stay. Maybe we should have, as its in a pretty courtyard."

Big Tip: go as close to opening (8:00 am) as you can because the later in the day it gets the more crowded it gets. You will stand in line to buy tickets and there will be so many people wandering around that it may mar your views and enjoyment. The line will form for the museum as well.

Went here during Easter stay in Marrakech based on top rated attractions of the city and the fact it was the residence of the late Yves Sant Laurent. The gardens are truly beautiful and largely under shade which makes for a really pleasant visit. You could easily spend a couple of hours here (especially if you go with your partner armed with a camera). The variety of different plants would also make it a real treat for any horticulturalist and the ponds and water features give the place a really serene feel despite heavy tourist traffic. For this reason an early morning visit is definitely recommended as well as to avoid the long queues to get in. Also on site is a cafe (didn't go in but the location and tourist clientele indicates it would probably be a bit expensive relative to local standards) as well as a small museum of Berber heritage. This costs extra to get in but is definitely worth it and was the best part of the visit. Inside you will find all sorts of items associated with Berber culture from fabrics and textiles, jewellery, musical instruments, decorative daggers and even blood-letting devices. Exhibit information plaques are all in French but you can pick up laminated cards with all the information on in other languages. Photography is not allowed in the museum itself (which is a real shame) and it's probably advisable to respect this rule as the small size of the rooms plus the fact there are attentive guards stationed in every one means you would easily get caught. Also note that the actual house of YSL is not accessible. It is possible to walk to the gardens from the Medina and it takes about 45 minutes to an hour (you will need a map). Otherwise a chartered tour bus or taxi is probably your only option, just make sure you agree on a price BEFORE getting in the latter. Overall definitely worth a visit."

Entrance is 70 dirham for tourists and 40 dirham for Morrocan citizens Advice: do not pay more than 30 dirham to go by taxi from jmaa el fna to the garden (and that is even too much!!) We went to Ourika for 30 dirham per person which was a 1 hour ride with the taxi (a local fixed it for us). There was a small stand outside of jardin majorelle that arranged balloon flights. Cannot remember the company's name but it was 165 euro's per person.If you do not like nature, do not go."

The majorelle blue color which is throughout the gardens is in great contrast to the many different plants. There is a cafe at the gardens so you can relax/cool off (shade and misters), nice selection of snacks and juices though a little expensive.Cost 70dh to enter, though they only charged us 50dh possibly because it was 3:30 when we arrived and the garden closed at 5p."

It is entirely your own choice to do a whistle stop tour or linger and look out for little gems of vistas to enjoy. The cafe served a small but quality menu and you can use cards and free wifi if needed, taxi back to centre of town is about 20dh more expensive from the rank outside the gate but very convenient when the rain returned!"

They work out much cheaper as you get to visit 2 maybe 3 gardens depending on the tour you book, with a horse and carriage ride too! We paid separately which worked out more expensive.

Also, meeting the usual 'helpful' people that ask you where you are going and point you up in a direction that is away from anything and they tell you the place is closed (just don't get why so many of them do this - just learn to ignore all of them - such a shame - maybe one in 10 would be genuine). Gardens small but very shaded and cool. toilets there and they are clean. Doesn't take long to get around but nice to sit on a bench and relax. A lot of catci areas and a little bamboo area. 70 dirhams to get in which seemed relatively expensive compared to 10 Dirhams for Bahia palace and 20 dirhams for Ben Yousseff house. Little catment area outside with a couple of eating places and smart boutiques. Interesting. Maybe worth a visit on your trip but a little out of the way. I will definitely think about bright blue garden pots in my garden after this visit but a lot of their painting eemed a crude, matte, bright blue and then one area had bright orange and yellow pots with two shades of blue. Not quite so natural although it did seem to be done in some very chalky, matt paint. And, there is a decent toilet to go to. It's nice that the profits go towards a lot of other enterprises."

The downside to that being, there are always a lot of people, tourists and locals alike, even whole school classes, walking around, so even though the noise of the streets doesn't reach you, it's never quiet.In summary I think it's not worth the price of entry or even the time it takes to go there."

I didn't visit the museum so (because i didn't have time) maybe that would have been more interesting but all in all it wasn't what i thought it was going to be. I was hoping for a more wow factor.

We enjoyed a delicious light lunch in the restaurant. The shop was very expensive as you might expect.

You have the opportunity to take some lovely pictures - luckily I went at a time when there were not many people around and the bright blue and yellow plant containers against the different colours of plants such as green and purple flowers etc makes it even more beautiful. Only 70 Dirhams (\u00a35ish) to get in or 100 Dirhams (\u00a37.50ish) including the Berber Museum which I did not have time to see. There is a small bookshop as well. You were not allowed to have food or drink inside the garden area (apart from the cafe) but it would have been very nice to sit within the garden and have something to eat. Can easily spend an hour or 2 here, even if one has no interest in plants! Very peaceful overall and very cool in the heat of the Marrakech! Worth the visit, once you've done a few other things!

We walked from our hotel inside the Medina, but it was a bit of a hike. If you're not in the mood for that then you may want to take a taxi. We arrived around 10, even though our plan was to arrive at 8 in the morning when they open, and because we got there a little later we were there with a school group of children as well as a tour bus of people. It didn't make the trip any less enjoyable but it did factor into taking pictures. There was a bit of waiting for people to clear out of my shots. Definitely go for a visit it's very lovely, and the barber in EZM that's part of it is also quite interesting."

The striking use of colour on the edging of water features (cobalt blue) and large pots around the garden (cobalt blue, soft blue, orange & citrus yellow) was really striking. The on-site Berber Museum, though small, is definitely worth the additional charge."

Although it is located in the middle of the city once you enter you are completely cut off from the outside world and its noise. The berber museum is interesting and overwhelming. If you leave it for last then you might be tired and may not really enjoy the second half of the museum like I me but my husband enjoyed all of it. It is a bit pricey for tourists but we found it worth the money. Going early is a must if you want to avoid long queues. we went around 10am and had to stand in the queue for almost 10 minutes. It was fast moving but still took us 10 minutes to get inside."

It's quiet and calm and completely isolated from the busy streets outside its walls. Outside the gate you can purchase a ticket for the gardens and a separate ticket for the berber Museum. I highly recommend you get both tickets so you can enjoy the wonderful Berber museum at the end of the Garden. Once inside, guests are offered a beautifully curated museum filled with berber history, jewelry, art and clothing. After a visit here -- all the pieces that you see in the souks immediately become alive! You'll enjoy the souks even more after an education on the Berber from this beautiful place."

There is an entrance fee of 70D per person at the time we visited.My wife and I strolled through this venue of natural art twice. We paused for some time at the various ponds to admire the vision of the artists brought to striking reality.This is an adult venue though we watched young groups of schoolchildren being enthralled by stories told by guides, a remarkable feat!This is a must visit if only to award yourself a few moments of tranquility after battling the overwhelming vitality outside."

As much as I loved the vibrant Medina, Gilesh is a lot less crazy and more cosmopolitan. The admission fee for the park was by far the highest we paid for an attraction in the City, but once we made our way around the garden grounds, we could see why. The park was saved from developers by Yves St Laurent and there is memorial to him within the grounds. The park is beautiful and vibrant, yet very relaxing. It is smaller than the other parks in Marrakech, but has a museum (you pay more for this), nice Cafe and a boutique. An oasis of calm in what can be a crazy city."

Whilst we really appreciated our trip here, I'm surprised that it's number 1 attraction and I can understand that it may be a disappointment if you are not a garden lover. At 70 dirham entrance fee (plus 30 for the museum) We'd got a taxi there and back. Our hotel receptionist had told us to pay a maximum of 30 dirhams each way.

It costs 70 dirham for entry to the garden but inside its peaceful and relaxing.We were hoping to discover colourful and vibrant garden with lots of flowers but it was nothing like that. It's just a normal garden with a few plants and palm trees. It was too small we walked the whole garden within 20 minutes. We did not visit the museum seemed ridiculous to pay again for entry that's within the garden.The gift shop is too expensive Overall this place is overrated as being one of the top tourist attractions in Marrakech honestly there's nothing much to see or do. Of course once inside you escape the madness of the Medina so it's peaceful and you can sit down and relax. It's the YSL legacy name that makes this place "

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice enough private garden, but for the price, you'd think you were going to get something more akin to Kew Gardens in London. You're not. This is not a botanical garden with specimens from all over the world, or even all over Morocco. This is just a nice ornamental garden. It's a lot smaller than you'd expect as well, especially given the price. The cafe was a nice pit-stop for lunch and the food there was fine. Overall, this wasn't worth going out of our way for, queueing for twenty minutes and then paying 100 dirhams each. To say we were underwhelmed is an understatement! Also judging by the numbers of fashionistas and YSL worshippers, I think this is a destination for fans of the famous fashion designer. That's fine - but it wasn't for us."

This visit can prove to me a good escape from the hustle and bustle of the Medina and Souks.Only negative point is that there is only 1 taxi rank outside and they charge over inflated fares. There is no other taxi rank, so are forced to pay this. You can try to haggle, but they usually don't budge. However this is no reflection on the garden.Best time to visit is early morning or late afternoon to avoid the crowds and groups.Definitely worth a visit and on the positive side it's only 10 Dhiram per person (roughly 80p!)"

The plants were disappointingly not native to the region but all the same everyone's face looked relaxed and easy as they walked around the area. It is lush, green with the wonderful blue paint creating an amazing feel of being somewhere special and cared for. It was like an oasis in a seething mass of noise. I would urge anyone to go there to feel the calm and care taken over the place."

Beautiful plant specimens, beautiful setting in general. We did not go into the museum, although I wish we had. It took us maybe 20 minutes to walk through at a slow pace. We were given a brochure explaining the history of the place. It was a decent time, but not something I'd go to Marrakech to see, or go out of my way to see."

All seen from sections of pathways.It has been the work in progress of Yves Saint Laurent to redevelop The Gardens and bring them back to their former beauty. There is a monument commemorating him.It isn't overly spacious, but it is very pretty and very well kept. There is a very attractive pond which u can walk around and also view from a wooden bridge, it's home to a variety of plants and reeds and also some of the tiniest Terrapins I've ever seen!,( far better environment than being locked inside a tiny cage in the baking sun to be sold at market)There's a lovely courtyard cafe.The Berber museum is definitely worth paying the extra dhms for."

It being February it was not too busy but clearly a popular tourist destination. It is all easily accessible for wheelchairs with smooth, hard paths.The beds are beautifully kept, very manicured. Lots of cacti, bamboo and other leafy tropical planting. In February the flowers were less in evidence other than bougainvillea which was flowering sumptuously.The star of the show is the colour blue. Rich and deep it contrasts with the planting and is set off by splashes of yellow on walls and on pots. It is a photographer's delight. Shadows on walls and reflections in water just ask to be photographed.There is a caf\u00e9, enticing menu but not so enticing prices. The shop was a disappointment as again, the prices were high. Clearly they were determined to avoid anything that said tourist or tat. Very much high end shopping.The museum is worth a visit if you want to know more about the Berber way of life. Information in English is available but very basic....not a lot of detail.It doesn't take long to walk around the garden but there are lots of places to sit down and enjoy what is in front of you."

The gardens and buildings were really lovely and tranquil. Although no-one has lived there for some time both are very well maintained! There are lots of benches dotted around so you can sit down and soak up the atmosphere. There are plaques with a little bit of interesting background dotted around and displays of Yves Saint Laurent paintings.

Perhaps if you have lots of time in Marrakech it's worth putting on your list but there are better paces to got to absorb the feeling of Marrakech than here. I was disappointed."

MAJORELLA GARDENS (Jardin Majorelle)Jardin Majorelle is a beautiful private garden developed by a French painter Jacques Majorelle (1886-1962) who lived in a house located within the garden which he named \u201cVilla Oasis\u201d. He took 40 years to adorn 12 acre garden with a varied species of plants and trees, bubbling streams, embracing pools and refreshing fountains. It is the most visited tourist place in whole of Morocco. The entry fee was 70 Dirhim (roughly 8 US$) in December 2015, with additional 30 Dirhim for an average type of Art Museum inside the garden. The garden has very charming atmosphere. The most striking feature of the garden is the vibrant blue color which is noticeable from its buildings, pool, fountains, footpaths, etc. It is one of the few places worth visiting in Marrakesh. It was open to public in 1947. After the death of Jacques Majorelle, the heirs decided to do away with the garden and plans for construction of a hotel on the site were in the offing when a French couple Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge bought it in 1980 and decided to continue it as a garden. After the death of Saint Laurent in 2008, his widow Pierre donated the garden to a Paris based foundation which is now successfully maintaining the garden as a best refreshing place in Marrakesh. The Foundation also built a memorial of Saint Laurent in the garden."

What a spectacular effort by one man to create an incubation area for plants being brought in from all parts of the world so they would survive and thrive. It wasn't in full bloom but the different areas of the gardens were exceptional. We particularly enjoyed the bamboo plantings, the exceptionally made fountains with koi swimming around oblivious to the world. The uniqueness of some of the plantings from far flung islands and continents showed his dedication. It was unfortunate it had begun to deteriorate and extremely interesting to find Yves St Laurant had paid to have the gardens brought back to their former glory. There is a memorial to him within the garden. What is not mentioned here is the fascinating (priced separately) Berber museum within the garden. What a spectacular collection of clothing, art, and artifacts of the original Moroccans.

We didn't buy ticket for the museum. However you can still visit Yves Saint Laurent gallery because it's in the outside of the museum.I love to see the cactus plants in this garden. I didn't know that cactus can grow that tall.Overall it's a nice garden. It's clean. They place officers in almost every corner of the garden. And the ambiance is cozy."

However I was quite disappointed with the garden and the museum. The garden looks nicer on pictures than in real and the museum is pretty small (it only has 3 rooms inside). I recommend going only if you have a lot of time to kill. Otherwise, go to the gardens of La Mamounia hotel; they have one of the most beautiful gardens in Morocco."

The food was middling, prices high, but it was OK. It's probably best to eat before visiting, though restaurants outside the main gate were pricey and very busy at lunchtime."

There are some famous places to strike a pose. Namely, the house and 30ft cactus plant. Stef and I visited with friends who hadn't even heard of the Jardin Majorelle, but once they were in, we found it hard to pull them out. The gardens have been sympathetically maintained and the art gallery and shops are a good place to buy trinkets . You can't go inside the house, so don't get your hopes up. It takes around 20-30mins to see everything but you might find yourself staying much longer to take pictures in every corner of this amazing attraction. Make sure you take a drink and something to eat if you do plan on staying longer, as there wasn't anywhere to buy proper food nd the drinks dispenser outside the gardens wasn't cheap."

There were only bamboo, agave, cactus, and Palm trees. Additionally, there were some different colored flowers on various vines.The only redeeming fact was that it completely blocked out all the sounds and sights of the busy city.We did not bother going into the museum as it is another 40MAD. Our time was better spent enjoying other greenery in the city such as \"cyber parc\". It is better located and not packed with tourist lining up to take pictures at various spots. I would recommend Cyber parc which is next to the main square (Jamaa el fna). Additionally, you can see local Moroccans enjoying life with their family and you feel more immersed in Moroccan culture."

Heading outside again the gardens had become busy and full of selfie stick wavers, creating tedium as you tried to avoid photo bombing...though at times was tempted! At 100DH for the gardens and museum was a tad overpriced when compared with the content of special exhibitions at the V&A or British Museum. Advice is to go early to avoid the selfies!"

I felt somewhat underwhelmed with some of the attractions Marrakech has to offer but these (I think mainly cacti) wonderfully tended gardens are a magnificent, tranquil haven set off by the vivid cobalt blue building and the entry fee of around 7 eur (10 with the museum) is far from being overpriced. I'd recommend seeing the Berber exhibits, beautifully displayed and the little room displaying the jewellery with the cleverly angled mirrored walls and tiny white lights evoke a North African starry sky perfectly, hats off to whoever designed it it's quality. Good also to see YSL's 'Love' posters...to sum up, a great all-rounder and you don't have to be a fashion fan for this to be a must-see."

It took 15mins to buy 2 tickets (100dhs each including the Berber museum). This is 5 times the price of any other site of interest in Marrakech. The garden is quite small - and unless you want to sit at one of the very few seats - you will need no more than 30mins to walk around. Lovely colours on the building against the sky but personally I thought Ben Youssef is far more rewarding in terms of culture, photos and fewer crowds."

The gardens are lovely but if they are crowded you cant take a single photo - the exhibition of YSL collages is small but lovely and it is a great shame that on my 3rd visit here they still do not offer posters of these collages for sale - the sales assistants in the library are disinterested and almost rude and I walked straight in and out after the gentleman at the cash desk was more interested in his computer than giving out any information. The tea room which is outside in a little courtyard is sweet but very pricey by marrakech standards as is the shop. However it is a joy to walk around these gardens with vibrant colours.

Worst part is, just the names of the plants along with from where are given without any other explanation. It\u2019s overcrowded and had security in every lane, as if the King himself was residing here. The museum was also a waste, had a decent collection but one could probably find more in a Medina shop.

He managed to hail a cab with an occupant and checked price before we got in 300dm. Once in the cab the Dutch occupant said he had lived in Marrakech for a time and you only paid 10dm for short journeys and 15dm for longer ones. (Local and tourist prices)!! but very little either way. Dropped off at the YSL gardens they are quite small but lovely and the Berber museum is worth a visit.

The gardens are primarily cacti accented with water pools, - some of the cacti I have never seen before - very unique. The gardens are highly manicured - workers everywhere maintaining the grounds. There is a lovely caf\u00e9 and small gift shopping. The gardens have a tribute to Yes Saint Laurent. It was a very relaxing experience with benches to sit and enjoy the lovely cacti. A nice break from the bustling city of Marrakech!"

Beautifully laid out with palm trees, exotic plants, bamboo, cactuses and water features. There's lots of shady spots and plenty of seats and makes it the perfect retreat from the heat and the busyness of Marrakech. They were originally created by Louis Majorelle in the 1920s and 1930s and his studio and garden furnishings are decorated in a vibrant shade of blue. Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion designer, and Pierre Berg\u00e9 bought it in the 1980s and a memorial to YSL is in the garden.In the grounds is a Berber Museum, which has a separate admission change, which has a small but interesting display. There is also a luxury gift shop and separate bookshop. The open air caf\u00e9 is delightful, although expensive by Marrakech standards but nice for a treat. Just check your change if you go as I was short by 10 MAD but when I called the waiter back he gave me the correct change. The gardens are quite small and can easily be done in less than an hour but I ended up staying over two hours walking round, taking photos (the place is very photogenic) and sitting down relaxing. It was my favourite place in Marrakech and I would highly recommend it."

The gardens consist of beautifully laid out cacti, palms, bamboos and generally green foliage. The contrasts are amazing. The Museum is more than worth the extra - do NOT miss the museum. It is small, but exquisitely laid out and while the exhibits do not run into the thousands, they are of exceptionally high quality, with cards in English, French and Arabic to explain and are beautifully presented. Yes, you could whizz around the gardens in 10 minutes, yes, you could speed through the museum in 5. Don't, treat this place like a fine wine to be sipped and savoured slowly. Didn't try the cafe, so no comment. Toilets very clean. 100 dirhams for the garden and museum, yes, it was well worth it. Signposting to the place is naff, so do your map homework up front."

Great for taking a little walk around, sitting and pondering, having a bit to eat/mint tea in the cafe, learning about Berber history in the Museum and admiring the mixtures of colours. Great for photography. TIP: the entrance is well off the main road, there's a horse/carriage stand and plenty of taxis, that's how you know you're close!"

If we'd gone in the heat if summer I'm sure we'd have welcomed the shade too. But I have to say after the 5 star reviews on here & some fantastic photos I'd seen with the amazing Majorelle blue walls/pots I was expecting something spectacular. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. We got a couple of good photos, but for the price (note: they also ask for a separate entrance fee to go into a small museum within the garden!) it really wasn't worth the money or time spent for us. Each to their own of course, but I wanted to express our opinion in contrast to all the people raving about this place, in case it helped visitors more like us!"

It's worth checking out if you're in the area, or if you need a new profile picture, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. One thing that was pretty crappy is that a lot of people carved their names into the plants throughout the garden. Most of the plants were all scratched up with people's names. Not cool."

As the garden is very small, the whole tour took about 20 minutes. The cafeteria in the garden was just awful and very dirty. The only thing about it was the wide range of cactuses and most of our time went there. I would suggest to skip the garden and visit all the palaces and free gardens of the town instead."

Its mainly cacti, which are not my thing to be honest, but still wonderful, with gorgeous painted colours somehow accenting (rather than dominating) the garden and ponds.

The contrast with the crowded Souks can't be much bigger. But, I can imagine the garden gets quite crowded during more polular seasons. Entrance is 70 Dirham, and some extra for the YSL-museum. We only visited the garden. Don't expect to visit the garden any langer then about 45-60 minutes. The garden offers a free toilet and a restaurant wich prices are quite high."

It was a small own tour through the gardens, if you dont mind the people who are taking pictures of everythin, it is quit peacefull. But there are no sitting areas for enjoying this view.

No one is rushed and they ensure that the museum is not over crowded so you may have to queue to enter the musuem, again, worth waiting for and the queue is in the shade. The staff are all very helpful and informative. YSL would have been proud of the staff. We walked from our Riad in the north of the Medina, cooo how exciting was that?!

(It is currently being added to by means of parking/facilities)Locals only have to pay 30 dirhams to enter and the garden is used to host educational events and botany lectures for free, all part of the YSL legacy.You only need an hour to look round unless you want to add on the Berber museum inside this is an extra 30 Dirhams and I only had an hour to spare so gave it a miss.We saw frogs and Terrapins in the ponds, cacti and bamboo which were an awesome sight.The monument to YSL is small but those who weren't impressed by it I think miss the point that the garden itself is a fitting tribute and the \"love\" gallery by the shop is also a tribute."

The rest of my party could not visit the museum because I was not able to purchase the entry to the museum, and again, they said I could not get in because of half a dirham! We got really aggravated and left, my friends went to the front ticket office to get a refund since they couldn't visit the museum either. The clerk said it was not her problem that I did not have half a dirham, but yet did not make the slightest attempt to fetch change. The gardens are beautiful but the staff spoiled the experience for us. Disappointing to the max. Only bad experience with Moroccan people, who tend to be friendly and attentive."

The vivid colours and water features are a treat for the senses and provide some fabulous photo opportunities.

So yes Majorelle is a great place like an oasis, nice garden, and they also have nice coffee place inside the establishment, to relax and have some drinks and food.It's a must see if you visit Marakesh"

You buy your tickets and walk through the gardens and the outside of the house - rich blues and yellows.There are galleries of art and an amazing museum of traditional Berber Moroccan jewellery and costumes - from over many many years. Bohemian heaven .... The jewellery is stunning. For me this was my favourite part.There's a book shop and gift shop with jewellery and some clothes and arty bits and bobs.

After paying the entrance fee (I believe it was 70DH or 7 Euros) you have access to the garden, the gift shop, and a very very small art gallery. You learn that this is where the artist Jacques Majorelle lived and created his art in the 1920s, and you can pay an additional fee to enter his house and museum. I enjoyed seeing all of the nature and architecture that inclosed the garden, but I believe the whole experience was a bit overrated. After walking around the entire garden, we saw less than a handful of plants that were actually from Morocco, or even Africa as a whole. The majority of these plants were taken from areas of Mexico, China, and various islands. We figured there would be more local plants, but it was cool seeing plants from all over the world. I say it was overrated because you spend 7 euros to walk around this garden that doesn't include a whole lot of history. Bring a camera and some walking shoes, but the kids may complain, so this may be more of a \"grown ups\" activity."

Following the visit you have the opportunity of visiting the cafe bar for a very welcome cup of refreshing Moroccain tea."

There is a small museum and if you can grab an attendant they and filled with wonderful information about the pieces in collection, especially the symbolism in design. Would have loved to have spent more time both with them and the gardens. Like a lot a Marrakech museums they do not cater well for English speakers (a universal language I thought). Such a shame as to convey their culture and history serves to extend understanding of its people . It is a beautiful place."

Now this is when YSL was still alive and the area was not as developed as it is today. At the time it was a true oasis in the desert. Today Marrakech has seen an influx in foreign monies that has changed the landscape. I gotta say my recent visit was very disappointing. I felt the true essence of the gardens have been lost.

It's worth doing the Berber museum in the corner of the garden - disappointingly no photos allowed, but it does present facts and information about the berber way of life that would have otherwise passed us by. You can buy a joint ticket at the entrance or pay separately to go into the museum, there is no price difference."

Quite a small area, densely planted, water features, and some architectural gems including a little painting pavilion of Arab-Andalucian style, and the Villa-Studio in a Modernist-Cubist style. Planters and surfaces often finished in deep blues and yellows which glow in the light dappled by giant bamboo. Places to sit and contemplate, listen to the birds singing, and wish you owned it! Nice terrace to purchase your mint tea, again a little more expensive than average, but good quality and service. Palms, other trees and cactus are often named if you have expert interest. Children seem happy with the surroundings also. Not to be missed on a visit to Marrakech if you have any sensitivity at all :)"

It took him some 40 years to landscape the gardens and winding walk ways which are stunningly planted with palms, ferns and cacti providing much needed shade and plenty of 'Kodak' moments at every turn. Later the house was more famously owned by the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. The former art studio now houses a small Berber Art Museum and there is also a walled cafe in the grounds but take lots of water with you. (Visited in October 2013)"

Either just having a tea or having lunch. Lunch portion were not huge, very good size for elder people, I think.The museum in the park charged MAD 30 in addition but it was worth enough for me. The mirror room was so beautiful and artistic. You can learn the culture there.Highly recommending to stay more than 1 hour at least. 2 hour is ideal, having short break at the cafe."

It's definitely one of the nicer, more lush gardens in the city but it isn't large and can be walked around in less than an hour. We walked from the main square which is about 30 minutes away and was easy enough to find (with a map). If you don't mind the walk I'd recommend a jaunt from the main square to the Cyber park, Park El Harti then Majorelle gardens and back which ticks off a good section of Marrakech since you won't spend long in the gardens. The gardens are worth seeing and it has an outside cafe which serves some lovely tea too."

I hear it's at its quietest early and late in the day, and I think others will enjoy it most when you can enjoy it in relative silence. Other reviews have complained about the price: 100 dirhams to visit both the Berber Museum and the Jardin Majorelle, but at \u00a37 for the two, that's a very good price compared to many US and UK museums and gardens."

If you also want to see the museum, it'll be $3 extra. $10 is enough to buy you a nice dinner with drinks here. It's a pleasant little place, sometimes can be crowded with tourists. It takes less than 15 minutes to stroll through the entire garden while taking a lot of pictures. I went through 2 times in 20 minutes to make sure that I didn't miss any nook or cranny. I understand that this is part of a foundation that does good social work in Morocco and your proceeds probably are for good causes but I think it's still overrated. So don't put it on top of your list. If you can't visit it, you won't miss much."

There is a separate fee for the Berber museum.You cannot use plastics to pay to get in (Dec 2015), however they will accept Euros as well as Dirhams, you are likely to have to queue.This is an exceptional garden even to the novice, a very leisurely stroll, with art decor, symmetry and bright colour used for emphasis contrast, which blends in beautifully.If you didn't come by taxi, almost immediately outside are taxis, it is worth bartering over the fare"

Luckily, my friend and I took a cab and did not have trouble finding the place. The entry cost is 70 dirhams. It's quite a small garden and can be visited in less than an hour. It uses art deco style and lots of bright colors. The YSL memorial is unimpressive. For the price, I was quite disappointed, especially considering how it was esteemed to be the best garden in Marrakesh. It was much too modern and ordinary for my taste. There's a pamphlet inside that explains that it is non-profit. I think I would've rated this much higher had it only been 30 or 40 dirhams instead (which is the price that Morrocans pay... yup...). To compare, Kew Gardens in London is my favorite garden in the world and I would pay to go regardless of the price. Can't say the same for this place..."

However, the cost of \u00a35 does not justify a visit (its cheaper for the locals). The gardens are so small that you can walk around in 10 mins and you are done. There are not many benches around; I suspect they don't want you to get comfortable and hang around for too long. You have to go early morning or late afternoon to avoid the harsh sun otherwise your photos/videos will come out lousy with too much of shade. This has to be the worst value-for-money attraction in the city, even if YSL had something to do with it. Disappointed."

The plants and setting are stunningly presented and the Lapis blue colouring throughout the garden takes your eye and makes you sigh.

The Berber Museum, which introduces Berber Culture is also quite small but beautifully done and a stark contrast to the far less curated Dar Sid Said museum (also in Marrakesh) - stick with the Berber museum over the two, for sure - you can see where your $10 entry fees go."

It is definitely a beautiful place, with vibrant colors and a wide range of palms and cactuses. There is a nice small museum you can visit for a small additional fee, and it houses some lovely old artifacts of the local Berber people.We went as a group of five, and overall we were all a little bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely a peaceful oasis in a bustling city and the \"majorelle blue\" color that adorns the entire garden is one of the most beautiful blues I have ever seen. But if you're limited on time and trying to squeeze this in, I would say take a tour of the Atlas Mountains instead!"

The place is actually quite sterile in a way with little atmosphere, other than seeming contrived. Dead-eye Gulch with lots of cactus but tidier.There are lots of security personnel to keep you moving, especially in the museum which is rather like walking into a high end boutique with no prices on the items - same feeling.Nice toilets - the staff conveniently stand outside waiting for their tips.Can't say I would recommend it."

We didn't visit the museum so can not comment on what is inside if it is worth the price tag.Personally I would have given it a miss if someone would have informed me about what to expect."

I marvelled at the care that has clearly been spent on the plants, ponds, trees etc in particular they seemed to produce excellent views as you walked round - it seems that the layout and botanics have been carefully considered and every step gave you another nicely balanced view. The deep blue that predominates is an excellent and resonant colour and comes out well even on rubbish cameras. The Berber museum is very good and worth the extra. It has some interesting artefacts and good explanations for its exhibits and I particularly liked the fact that the costume manekins have no faces and are shaded by the overhead lights - wierd when you are alone. I loved the quite good free wi fi in the cafe which meant I could contact my daughters after having been out of town for a few days. So why isn't it five stars?After I had been there some time I noticed that it had become packed with people and the original mellow vistas were now thronged with people taking pictures so either they were in the few I took or I was in theirs. There was nowhere to tuck yourself out of the way and contemplate the subtle beauty of this place anymore. As I left c. lunch time I noted there was a huge queue to get in now along the boundary wall. The other slightly negative element was that (certainly by comparison to other attractions in Marrakech) I found it a bit twee and contrived after a while. It is nevertheless a lovely attraction and has plenty of potential for superbly composed pictures when it is quiet."

And to get there you'll probably need a taxi, because it is in the modern part of Marrakech, away from the medina.If you're not a botanist or really into gardens, I suggest to skip this place. If you're interested in the Berber culture go to the Dar Si Said museum in the medina. It's much cheaper, you will see the same things and on top of that you get a peek inside a beautiful old building."

This is probably the top attraction in Marrakech because of the serenity (even when it's crowded) you can find in the shade appreciating the lovely gardens. The admission fee (70MAD) is high compared to most other attractions in Morocco (cheaper, of course, for locals) and does NOT include the fantastic Berber Museum! Make sure you add on admission to the museum (another 30MAD, I believe). It's wonderful and I felt I learned more about the Berber people while appreciating and enjoying the exhibits and accompanying artifacts, clothing, jewelry than I had in 2 weeks touring Morocco.Fantastic!There's also a somewhat pricey cafe, but if you're needing a little bit of class and European dining, you'll like this."

In 1980 good old YSL and another guy bought it and restored it. It is now rather nice and includes a memorial to Yves Saint Laurent. You walk along painted concrete paths and brightly coloured pots and urns filled with plants. There are beautiful tall trees, bamboos and a wonderful collection of all kinds of cacti. There are lots of pools and fountains It is a lovely peaceful oasis amongst the madness of Marrakech. It will cost you 70 dirhams to enter the garden, around \u00a35 and a further 30 dirhams to look around the Berber museum. it's not a large place so 1-2 hrs is plenty of time to see it all. The Berber museum is small but houses a small but beautiful collection of Berber jewellery and clothing. You can take photos in the garden but not the museum. There is a small shop selling a variety of clothing, bags etc but in true YSL fashion it is very expensive, as is the nice courtyard cafe."

I have read that you need to get tickets the day before to avoid the queues, but I went in the afternoon and there was no queue and were straight in, However I did visit in November. Access the gardens cost 70 MAD and the museum is 30 MAD. Which is approx \u00a36.50 for both. The Musuem is inside the house and is very small and only on one level, it is fully accessible for wheelchairs. You can pay seperately for the musuem on the door, if you only purchased garden tickets and change your mind. I loved the colour of the house, its like nothing I have seen before and the gardens are beautiful. There is a small art gallery and shop aswell as a restuarant.I would recommend getting a taxi here from the medina, it cost 40 MAD (approx \u00a32.50) and dropped me right outside. You can walk, but it is a far distance and the surrounding area didn't feel very safe for me. It is also not sign posted until you are almost there. Do bring a camera! Fantastic pictures because of the brightness of the house."

The gardens are a bit outside of the city walls, perhaps a 45-minute walk from Jamma El-Fna. Unfortunately once leaving the Medina the walk is not the most pleasant we\u2019ve encountered \u2013 busy city \u2013 but the reward is worth the trip. Alternatively it is a short inexpensive taxi-ride (we returned via taxi - note the first taxi outside the entrance/exit said 50 dirham, we walked away, then 40 dirham, we continued to walk, then 30 dirham, still walking, finally 20 dirham and we got in)Once inside the walls the lush gardens are peaceful and tranquil, with a focus on bamboo forests and cactus. Being near the city centre, although not inside the walls, the gardens are not massive. Yet they are large enough, along with the Berber Museum to spend a couple of hours if you take your time. The few hours were a calming escape from the intensity of Marrakech. At 70 dirham for the gardens and another 30 dirham for the Berber Museum the entrance fee did seem a bit pricey although it certainly did not deter visitors as the gardens are quite popular.Although there is an additional cost for the museum it is well worth it. Having just spent three weeks touring Morocco, most in the south through the Berber areas the museum was a fantastic presentation of Berber culture and life. An excellent opening video of Berber people and villages followed by exhibits of costumes, weaving, doors, ornaments and jewellery, musical instruments, tools and weapons made for an informative and fascinating presentation. The Berber gift shop, while expensive has a number of beautiful, high quality items for purchase. As well there is a Caf\u00e9 for breakfast, lunch or a drink.My wife is the gardener but I readily admit I too very much enjoyed my time in the Gardens and the Berber Museum, which should tell you how wonderful they are."

The Yves Saint Laurent connection is there too, which didn't really mean much to me I have to admit, but it all adds to the appeal :) we arrived at lunchtime so headed straight for the lovely garden cafe, and the food was delicious and well priced. We tried to walk there but got lost as the maps are named but the actual streets don't seem to be, so we flagged a taxi (always confirm the price before you get in!!) and there's a taxi rank right outside for getting back too.

Mostly palms and cacti it's the juxtaposition of textures and leaf shapes that hold you spellbound. It's quite small, but very very interesting and well designed. It also holds the Berber Museum which is absolutely a gem! Artefacts, clothing and jewellery are displayed. Fabulous. Highly recommended. There is also a cafe, a small gallery and a shop. There is also a bookshop at the Musee Berbere. Don't miss this. Go early to avoid the queues."

Compared to other attractions in Marrakesh this one costs 100 MAD to get in i.e. about 5 - 10 times more than other places. The garden is actually fairly small and unless you're very interested in plants probably takes no more than 30 minutes to walk around. There is a large display of cacti. Included within our ticket was entrance to the small on site Berber museum which was interesting enough although all in French - takes about 15 minutes., There is quite a nice cafe on site also. We walked there - it's about 15 minutes walk from the city walls and easy to find - use offline maps and GPS on your phone and you can't get lost!"

There is a wide range of trees and exotic bushes and plants from around the world. There are also lovely ponds. The Berber Museum (no photos allowed) is very interesting with displays of clothing, jewellery, musical instruments, weaponry, etc. There is also a memorial to Yves St Laurent, a very good caf\u00e9, a bookshop and a boutique. You can have a leisurely stroll though each section. You can even find a bench to sit and let the world go by. About a half day to get there and back and see everything. Definitely worth the time!"

However once there it was easier to buy a ticket for the garden and the Berber Museum, rather than buy the tickets separately. The garden is actually a number of different gardens located together. It is extraordinary to walk into a cool path shaded by bamboo, to find a large cactus garden and then find a water garden.The Museum takes time though it is only 4 rooms as numbers are limited at any one time and the pace is slow as each group is given time to watch videos and examine the displays. I had lunch at the caf\u00e9 sitting in the courtyard. It was busy but the service was efficient and pleasant and the food was tasty. There are cafes outside the gardens which served a variety of food and looked busy and pleasant.I decided to wait for the Bus to get back to Ville Nouvelle which resulted in a long wait as the bus arrived about 20 minutes after the time advised. There are other options as there were plenty of taxis available and it is possible to walk, though it is quite a distance.Overall it was a very pleasant way to spend a few hours in a location different to the shops of the Ville Nouvelle and the bustle of the souks."

You can stay here for as long as you like, I saw a few people sitting on benches reading novels in the garden so I could imagine that would be a nice idea if you lived in the city. The gardens also contain a book & gift shop where I bought a really pretty bookmark. There is also a little cafe here which I decided not to stop in, it looks very pretty but from what I can remember the menu was a little disappointing. If they worked on improving the cafe I think the visit would definitely be enhanced.

We took our two boys (6 & 7) and they enjoyed looking at the wildlife in the ponds particularly. It is not massive, but such a beautiful place doesn't have to be. The taxi & horse and cart drivers can be a little over inflated on their prices back into town (with so many tourist about) so haggle hard if you think you are not getting a fair price, and just walk down the road a bit to find someone a bit further away if you need to.Highly recommended."

The cacti, the layout, the colours, the tranquil atmosphere really struck a chord with them. Don't skimp on the entrance fee - the Berber museum is a little gem and well worth the extra. Top marks for the cafe too - really nice food, stylishly presented. It may be a bit more expensive than some places around Marrakech but the setting and the staff make it good value for money (which is more than can be said for the items in the boutique and the bookshop - the pricetags merited a very sharp intake of breath!)."

If you're Moroccan you gain entry at half the price, if not it come at a slightly higher entrance fee of 70md (around \u00a34). It's a great place for photo opportunities and makes you feel like you're in a different country all together with the bamboo and exotic plants and animals- it definitely made me feel as though I was in a rain forest. The garden closes at sunset so be sure to goa few hours before dark- they're very strict about closing time and will literally shoo you out! Any one who works there will most likely expect a tip if they take a photo of you or oh ask them questions so do your research and ask other tourists for photos!"

In addition it contains an excellent museum dedicated to Berber culture - beautifully put together - well worth the 100 dirhams entrance for both attractions.

After the death of YSL in 2008, Pierre Berge donated the gardens to the Foundation Pierre Berge - Yves Stain Laurent. The foundation Jardin Majorelle was established at this time. A memorial to the French Fashion designer was built in the garden. The colours are amazing and one can spend a quiet tranquil time just sitting in the garden. I would recommend a visit here for all garden lovers."

It is more expensive than other attractions so either visit at the beginning of your stay or make sure you have enough left over towards the end.

I'd recommend going early because when we went it was really busy and you couldn't really see everything as the paths are quite narrow. The cost was 70 dirhams each to entry - about \u00a35. If you don't want to sit and reflect you'll finish walking around in 1 hour. You can then bumble around in the local area and have a coffee - it's nice around the area."

Also probably the most expensive attraction of the Country, as the ticket cost ten times the price of any entrance to any other museum you may visit. The berber museum shows the same artifacts you will have repeatedly seen if you visited other parts of Morocco. Particularly unpleasent, in a place of this kind, to be harrased by one of the supervisors who was insistently pretending I was taking pictures of one of the workers painting a pot. Instead of directly asking for money, as it would experience anywhere outside, he insisted I had to ask for permission to the worker (who could not care less) and take I picture I had not intention to take in exchange for a tip. With what the Management asks to pay for the entrance or a coffee in the restaurant, that staff could be the better paid and put in condition not to harrass tourists."

Charm of it might be that it is supposed to be a calm oasis just out of the buzzing city life. However, since the place is filled with tourists it ruins the essence of the place. The caf\u00e9 has nice food and drinks."

The pond, the water lilies and the house may be unusual for Marrakech held no great attraction. To be fair the Berber Museum had an attractive selection of items especially the silver jewellery. A memorial to Yves St Laurent and some Christmas cards of his design are also exhibited.My wfe however thought the place had some charm. Horses for courses."

In 1932 he built a studio in Art Deco style, painted Majorelle blue, a colour synonymous with Morocco today. He created a garden of exotic plants and rare species and opened it to the public in 1947. After his death in 1962, the property fell into ruins until 1980 when Pierre Berge and Yves Saint Laurent purchased it, restored and expanded it. The studio was redesigned as a museum to Berber culture. Later a bookstore, Cafe, and Boutique were added. After Yves Saint Laurent's death in 2008, Pierre Berge donated the property to the Foundation Jardin Majorelle, and a stele memorial to Saint Laurent was built. Saint Laurent's ashes are in the gardens."

Costing 70d per person just for just the garden visit (the museum was extra) we were disappointed that it was quite small, taking only about 10 minutes to walk around, and quite unimaginative. It boasted some unusual and exotic plants but the arrangement was uninteresting and certainly not inspirational. Most of the planted areas were laid in large straight edged beds with plenty of space between the plants, similar in feel to a zen garden. A couple of fish ponds with a few gold fish and Terrapins broke up the planting interspersed with a few pretty tiled areas."

Entrance fee of 70 DH is pretty expensive comparatively. The fee for the Berber museum inside the garden is separate and will cost you another 30 DH. The Cafe Bousafsaf inside however gives you a peaceful moment, sitting down to have lunch or good coffee and cakes. The menu also provides Moroccan choices. Having a chance to enjoy the nice gardening environment, please expect to pay pretty much. One cappuccino and one lemon tart cost 100 Dirham in total. Herbal tea about 40 Dirham. Alternative choices should be the restaurants on the road right outside the entrance."

Created in 1931 by the French artist Jaques Majorelle, the house was later bought by Yves St Laurent and became his hideaway and favorite place to work and relax. The house is painted in an extraordinarily vibrant indigo blue and the walkways and garden pots are painted to match making it a small \"Blue Heaven\". We were taken to the gardens by horse carriages, which were an extremely comfortable ride and a very good way to see the city, but we couldn't help feeling sorry for the horses who had to compete against thundering great lorries on the main roads."

Set in the bustle of the city of Marrakesh the gardens are amazingly tranquil and cool. Take a stroll around the paths and admire the exotic plants and ponds full of fish, enjoy the Berber museum which is an attraction in it's own right, and then take some refreshment in the on-site caf\u00e9. This is a delightful way to spend a couple of hours in the heat of the day."

The woman we purchased our tickets from didnt give us a receipt so when we went to enter the garden we had to return to the ticket booth where an argument ensued over the \"lost\" tickets. The garden is well suited for a distraction from the business of Marrakech life. The garden is beautiful with various plants. The garden is outside so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Located inside the garden is the love gallery where some drawings of Yves Saint Laurent New Years Eve are located. Throughout the garden there are two gifts shops. One is the main gift shop and the other is just a small gift shop as you exit the museum. Also, within the park is a free museum that displays native Beber artifacts, clothing and intricate jewlery. Although there is no photography allowed with in the Berber displays my favorite was the jewlery. The room that houses the jewlery is made to represent a dessert night and is complete with sand and stars. Overall, it was a relaxing enjoyable experience."

This isn't terribly large, it was pretty full of other tourists and it's certainly one of the most expensive sights in Marrakech. That said, it was very diverting for an hour. There are some lovely ponds - one in particular is covered in lilly pads and looks like a Monet painting. They have fish and turtles in the ponds, and they are fun to watch. The Berber museum is really interesting. It costs a further entrance fee, but it tells you a lot about their everyday way of life. The cafe is sweet, I recommend avoiding the little table all the way over on the right under the tree. It looks inviting, but birds poo on unsuspecting visitors (yes, I was one of them!) There is an indoor section that is air conditioned, but people were smoking in there. I would have loved more explanation about the plants we were looking at. The bamboo is amazing and so are all the cacti, but there were loads of plants that I couldn't identify, and some signs would have helped. Overall it was a nice visit, a little different to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech streets - although as soon as you leave you are pounced on to take a taxi!"

I didn't quite understood why the guardians asked to see the inside of my purse (luckily I kept my two boxes of tampons in a separate bag for which they didn't show any interest), but as they talked to me in a very respectful manner, I accepted to swim down the stream (I then saw that I wasn't the only one whose insides of her purse weren't a secret anymore).

A visit well worth making , the layout is good utilising many opportunities to create vistas and features which is hard in essentially such relatively small garden . The typical use of water and hard features gives the skeleton to the garden and many photo opportunities are offered as a result. The planting is not hugely varied but the scale of some of the species more than makes up for that. I found some of the eye wateringly expensive retail opportunities a little incongruous and the prices in the cafe were higher than in most places but both of those need not spoil an otherwise excellent visit. Good to see cactus collections still going strong and walking through 10m high bamboo is a rarity. Maintenance standards are very high and those with less mobility should visit as the paths are very well maintained and easily navigable. Operators ought to be aware that traders on the exit from the old city are regularly telling people on foot the garden is closed for a holy day ....it's not , so just keep going !!"

You are given a booklet which tells you all about the gardens, In English! It tells you the history and all of the stories behind the gardens and how they have developed throughout their time. There are different languages on the boards. There are also a lot of birds which make the gardens more magical. I do not have a favourite part because i thought all of it was beautiful and amazing.. minus the food. i Loved the frogs in the pond though. I have seen many gardens in my 18 years of life as my mother is a crazy passionate flower gardener freak. This was one of my favourite gardens. Well worth the visit. However, i do not recommend the restaurant, its very expensive and i couldn't eat the food served to me as it had a strange taste. The gardens do not allow you to take in your own food. There are a lot of other food places about outside of the gardens though! There are places to sit and read, you can take photos and there are toilets ( they expect you to pay but this is normal) I think it is suitable for everyone, all ages. Enjoy!"

Saint-Laurent would roll in his grave if he could see the memorial created for him. Horrible! The museum is much better than the garden."

Finding Jardin Majorelle was not easy. The entrance is not on the main road as our map indicated but with some help we found our way. If you get to the garage you have gone too far.The road of the entrance has shops unlike most in Marrakesh, they are very western, designer and expensive. However you can get a proper expresso in the cafe opposite the entrance. It is an expensive entrance fee, but i was still excited. Once inside it was packed and very small within ten minutes we had walked the whole garden. Yes there are some beautiful plants and amazing cactus but nothing special and just so small. There is of course a cafe, which is again pricey and not that great. I would give it a miss and spend the money taking a cab out of Marrakesh and just go for a walk and you will see far more of natures beauty."

The patio restaurant was nice, though not surprisingly a little bit on the expensive side--you're paying for convenience and ambience. Food was decent though. Overall, the 70 dirham entrance was perhaps a bit steep. It might be worth it if you bring a book and make a plan to sit on a bench in the shade for a while. Otherwise it's a pretty quick stroll with a lot of other tourists. But like the other reviewers have mentioned, it is a nice setting for some pretty photos. If you have plenty of time in Marrakesh, or just need a break from the intensity of the medina, I'd recommend it. "

When we arrived by taxi, I was with a Moroccan friend of mine and we noticed that there were different prices for foreign tourists and local Moroccans. I thought paying the 70 dirham price would be fine until I walked in. The Gardens are much smaller than I expected, the museum was closed when we were there and although some of the plants were pretty to look at, it was full of plants from other countries, I felt it would have been better to have plants from all over Morocco. Many of the cacti and plants I had already seen from spending time abroad and traveling throughout America. Overall, I thought the gardens were overpriced and can't believe that it is the #1 thing to do in Marrakech. The souvenirs in the gardens store were quite pretty but also WAY overpriced and you can find similar gifts at the medina for much cheaper."

I visited with my husband and kids (11, 8 & 7) as part of a horse & carriage trip. We only had about 40 mins there and I would have liked much longer. It was probably the right amount of time for the kids who started to flag in the heat. The garden itself isn't that big but the winding paths, water features and clever planting make it seem quite big. Obviously the planting is limited to the soil/climate but there are good examples of cacti & palms. There was a cafe, book shop & museum but we didn't have time to use them. I will definitely return (on my own so I can really enjoy it!)"

It was cheap to get in and staff were very helpful. There are signs and posts around to explain where the botanical plants have come from. A lot of hard work has gone into caring for this place.If you are into gardens, nice scenery and like the designers work then it's a lovely dove to spend some time. The cafe there was my favourite place throughout our stay. Our children had crepes for a snack and I had the mint tea which was the best mint tea I had throughout my stay. I could quite happily sit in the courtyard cafe for hours just reading a book or looking around people watching. There's also a lovely bookshop and a small shop with Yves Saint Laurent goods. There's plenty to read about the designer and his story of prints. There's a museum which teaches about the different 'tribes' and times from area to times. This was fab for the children to learn about too. If highly recommend a visit here."

The museum is small but skillfully curated; starting with a short video on the Berbers and following on with the most wonderful artifacts especially clothing, jewelry which is just exquisite to ceramics, pottery and leather work. This small museum demonstrates the rich diversity of BerBer culture and because it is small one is not overwhelmed.

The gardens take about 20 mins to see (pretty small), they have a lovely design for a hot country with amazing cactuses and a gorgeous lily pond. But coming from London we're pretty luck to have amazing gardens all around town, so perhaps we're a bit spoilt. We enjoyed a nice (but expensive) brunch in the cafe."

Number one it's more than double the entry cost of any other attraction or palace/garden and the cafe is so overpriced as to be a joke. A glass of lemon (citron presse) was a ridiculous 55 dirham (approx. 5 - 6 euros at the time). Sandwiches or cakes were the cost of a whole three course evening meal elsewhere. Its a beautiful place and an oasis of a place, with stunning planting but take your own refreshments or be prepared to take out a mortgage."

The Berber museum was really well done and gives you an insight into their jewellery and clothing - I recommend saving this until you can't stand the heat anymore - it's air conditioned in there. You can easily get around both areas within an hour if the objective is only to see everything. The only disappointment was having to pay money to use the bathroom. 100 MAD is surely enough of an entrance fee to cover that."

The soothing architecture and vibrant colors make this sanctuary almost magical. If they'd only have a spa next to the quaint cafe, it'd be perfect.

Unfortunately it's VERY EXPENSIVE and very out of the way for what at most is a 30 minute visit? If even?If you were really into photography, I can understand the appeal. It is a photographer's 'dream' except that it is so crowded with tourists that no matter what angle you took the photo someone was in it.We paid over 100dh for entry to the garden and in to the museum. The museum was a complete let down - a total of three rooms with not much to see, we walked in and out within 3 minutes! They have a cheek to have a gift shop (which is bigger than the actual exhibits!)When we visited, there were a lot of bins sitting out and staff maintaining the ground so they spoiled any photos we took. The benches were freshly painted with wet paint signs so you couldn't sit down and take in the 'sights.' We noticed that a lot of the garden had been vandalised with graffiti or etched into the plants.If the taxi and entry fee wasn't so expensive, maybe I could have enjoyed it.If you're a photographer, yes, go, (early to avoid the crowds) but I wouldn't bother with the expense for a walk that takes less than 10 minutes!"

My husband stayed at our hotel while me and my two friends took the visit. This is not really his thing but i did tell him after i think he would have really enjoyed it. Once there you feel like you are in a completly different area to the hustle and bustle of the city. It is so peaceful and tranquil that walking round you just have a constant smile on your face seeing the beautiful and vibrant colours, the amazing differnt cactus and plants and just genrally having a very calming experience. Yes it is just a garden but it just seems to have a differnt feel to it then 'just a garden'. At a gradual walking pace you will be there for a hour but if you want to visit the museum in the garden do allow a little longer. It is cooling with all the shade but we did arrange to go early in the morning which also meant that there were not very many people arround fighting to get a good picture or taking away the calmness. There is no wonder why this is a top rated thing to do in Marrakech and i for one highly reccommend it."

The cafe is situated in a very pleasant courtyard and do stop by for the Majorelle juice, a refreshing blend of healthy fruit. The Berber Museum is also worth a visit, especially the jewelry room which is most impressive. The boutique is quite overpriced, but then the Yves Saint Laurent memorial must be complemented by top-end jewelry and leather products."

The garden may be difficult to find if you are a newcomer to Marrakech as its down a small side street in the new town however it is worth the search. It's a beautiful shady garden filled with lush tropical trees and there is also a memorial to Yves Saint Laurent as he died in the town in 2008 and had spent time there. There is a little section at the side of the garden showing his famous LOVE prints, he created a new version every year. They were replica LOVE postcards in the gift shop which I bought several of. There is a small Berber museum within the gardens at a small extra cost. We found the museum very interesting with lots of traditional Berber costumes on display. Definitely worth going to for an hour or too but maybe not as a main event as garden is not huge. We had mint tea in the cafe which was very enjoyable but prices were possibly a little higher in reflection of it being a well known tourist attraction. Definitely worth the visit if you venture out of the busy square."

Jardin Majorelle is one of our favourite attractions in Marrakech, and it's definitely worth taking a trip there even it's quite far away from everything else. A lot of photo worthy spots, and staff are generally very helpful and are willing to take group photos for you.Because of its popularity, taxi drivers outside and around the garden are particularly unscrupulous. Consider walking back to the medina or only hail a taxi streets away from the garden. Our taxi ride from the riad to the garden cost us 15dh (negotiated price), and generally wherever we go drivers are happy to take anything under 20dh. The taxi driver accosted us outside the garden (who is a part of the 'official' taxi drivers with the Majorelle Taxi t-shirts), took us to the car and asked for 100dh. We left the taxi and walked a street away in a fury, and another taxi (independent driver we suppose) offered to use the meter, which turned out to be rigged, costing over 30dh for a much shorter distance. Our riad is near one of the mosques, and despite our insistence that we do not plan to go inside the mosque but back to our riad nearby, the driver said we could not go there and took us to a wrong area 15 min walk away from our riad. His friend on the street offered to show us the way (for the tip), even the riad is definitely reachable by the taxi."

The gardens are extraordinary, but DO NOT MISS the Berber Museum. The room that displays the jewelry is dark, lit only by a ceiling of lights that looked like stars.

It's a nice garden with lots of shady spots to escape the midday heat, but that's about it. Our guidebook had said entry would cost us 50Dh but when we got there, they said it was 70Dh for the garden and 100DH for the garden and house, which is basically hosting a berber museum. In my opinion, 70Dh was much better spent on the several other landmarks we visited like Bahia palace or the Ben Youssef Medersa, all of which charged 10-20Dh per person. If you're short on time, I'd recommend you skip this."

Look out for the frogs, we heard this incredible level of noise almost like a raucous peacock and were looking overhead - it took us several minutes to realize it was these tiny creatures on the lily pads in the water. The numerous species of cactus, the myriad shapes and sizes, is amazing - their stillness amidst the exuberant foliage and bright electric blue and gold pots around such a good contrast. The Museum is also worth a visit. There was an exhibition on the Amazigh (Berber tribes) which was very interesting."

There's also a boutique shop and small gallery of YSL Love prints that you can buy as postcards. You also get a free map and info leaflet. The tearooms are delightful, we had sorbet and drinks but the lunch menu looked brilliant. Maybe a little pricey but worth it. Also good WC facilities. Recommend getting a taxi there and onwards."

Visit early if possible, as I imagine big crowds detract from the tranquil atmosphere. The Berber Museum is well worth the few extra Dirhams, and provides insight that I feel enriched my understanding of Morocco overall. YSL collected a significant amount of Berber artifacts over many years, and they are artfully displayed here. The collection of various traditional Berber clothing was particularly fascinating."

Nice to see and get a rest from the soaring temperatures -- it's beautifully cool in there with shade and a light breeze. Not sure it's my number one for Marrakech but nice nonetheless."

The Garden and house was initIally created by French painter Jacques Majorelle and later became famous as the home of designer Yves St Laurent. It is a beautiful and tranquil escape from the hustle of Marrakech. It is only 70 dirhams to enter and an extra 30 for the Museum, which is definitely worthwhile. Even in the heat of the day the gardens remain cool and have a wonderful air of peace and tranquility. The restaurant is very reasonably priced with a good selection of coffees, soft drinks and food. This is a lovely place to spend between 1 and 2 hours relaxing."

In high season be prepared to get there early by taxi, to avoid the queues. It is not a massive garden but you can spend a good couple of hours here, beneath the trees and if you are a cat lover like me, you'll be able to spot some adorable cats and their families living amongst the plants. There is a delightful little caf\u00e9, a chic boutique and decent loos all within the garden. Outside the garden you will find yourselves in a hip part of Marrakech, more French than Arabic - chic shops and cafes so make sure to stroll around these too."

With over 300 types of plants and lots of carefully placed walks and fountains, the garden is a beautiful haven you can escape to when the red of the city gets a bit too much. One of my favourite things about the garden was the dominant cobalt blue colour, or as it is known in Morocco Majorelle Blue, that was all over the garden, in the bridges, pagodas, flower pots and fountains. Within the garden itself, the combination of blue, teal, orange and yellow creates a stunning result that makes the garden both look wild and meticulously put together at the same time. I could see myself spending many hours in that garden if I had the chance, taking a stroll or just sitting in a quiet corner to read or write something. It's the combination of plants, flowers and water that make it a very tranquil space that is definitely worth visiting, so make sure you add it to your list."

None of the staff pressured us when we were browsing. We did not eat in the cafe. The museum inside was well worth the extra cost, and was extraordinary. At the time it was a Berber exhibit. It is small, but world class presentation. There is also a nice museum gift shop with books, pictures and postcards - more cultural and historical than touristy.We walked there from the main square (was a little too far in the heat) but took a taxi to the Saadian tombs - which cost 50 dirhams. There is a cluster of cabs outside the gardens with some sort of ring leader who will approach you when you leave - but the driver himself arranged the price with us. The driver gave us a lovely tour on the way back."

We got to see all the zillion varieties of cactus imported from Mexico and visited the garden shop, which sells some interesting objects including some authentic, well-displayed antiques, which are extremely pricey. Note, some of the same cushion covers can be had outside for a third or fourth of the price and while the antiques too are expensive, it's possible they are far older than what you might see in the other antique shops. Don't miss going to the 33 Rue Majorelle store outside the garden, which has products from various local designers. I believe the Berber museum is very nice, with many artifacts unlike most Moroccan museums we saw. A good place to see the variety of Berber jewelry in case you intend to buy any from antique shops."

The onsite Berber museum, although very small, was also really interesting (grab an English exhibit guide as you walk in as most signage is in French). The cafe was well-priced and very quaint.We could have stayed all day, however come midday it started to get crowded with tour groups so we headed on our way.

The Gardens are owned by the estate of Yves St Larent and cost 25 Dirhams entry fee and a further 25 Dirhams for the museum. I cant think of any attraction in the UK that costs less than \u00a33.50 p to get in and is well worth the money. We were in no rush and spent about an hour wandering around the gardens, and the water features, there are numerous photo opportunities as well as the Museum, a gift shop ( expensive in my opinion ) cafe and toilets.Its a lovely way to spend a couple of hours and I thoroughly recommend it."

After seeing many uninspired photos of the gardens I wasn't sure how much I would actually like it especially as the entry fee is only around \u00a33.60 (nothing compared to what you might pay to visit some RHS gardens back near London)We walked the 20 or so minutes from the medina through the busy streets and missed any signs overshooting the turning by a block so keep your eyes peeled.Luckily when we arrived the gardens weren't too busy so a leisurely stroll around, taking photos wasn't a problem. It is a shame that people have felt the need to engrave their names in the base of many of the beautiful bamboos and even cactii but it is better that than the alternative of high fenced off walkways meaning you cant get close to the planting.Nothing can prepare you for the intensity of that YSL 'Marjorelle' Blue though. Painted walkways and the central museum blow you away with strategically placed contrasting pots making fantasic photo opportunities. I did hear one man ask his partner why she was taking a picture of a bare blue wall!!?If this is you, then it is probably best to stay away as you won't get anything from you visit but if like us, you take time to soak it all in, you can have a lovely relaxing walk around.The cafe was affordably priced in comparison to London and the food very good..We do recommend their fabulous fruit juices (about \u00a33) to quench a thirst and set you up for the short walk back into the Medina"

It's inspired my husband to paint some pots and try out some of what we saw - how it will all look in the drab Kent sunlight will be interesting! I would have liked more information on the day of house and the French painter who created it to give the place more of a context and history. A little more information on how Yves St Laurent came to be involved in the place would have been interesting to. All this can obviously be found through a quick Google search but a brochure would have been good.

The garden itself and the architecture and colors within it are stunning, and it's well worth a visit...the Berber Museum here is also beautiful and interesting (it's small, though). I liked learning about the history of the garden and the fact that it was saved and restored by Yves Saint Laurent and is currently managed by his foundation (which means it's very well maintained). However, there were so many people here on the day we went that it made it very difficult to enjoy the garden or take photos. We went first thing in the morning and there was already a long line and throngs of people in the garden. I had heard this place described as tranquil and a good place to sit and read a book of an afternoon, or to meander and enjoy some peace and quiet in hectic Marrakech, but there was easily a couple bus loads of people here. It's similar to other major attractions in Marrakech in that way--like the palaces or Saadian tombs, so just be aware of that. The gift shop has some beautiful and unique items, but none of it is inexpensive. If you're going to get a taxi from the garden to the square or something, go over to the main street...don't take one of the taxis lined up directly outside the garden--they'll charge you 50 dirham to go anywhere, even for a short distance. This was one of the most exorbitant quotes we received. The max it should cost to take a petit taxi anywhere within Marrakech is 20 dirham during the day, 30 at night. We tried to haggle two of the garden taxi drivers down to 20 and they let us walk away, presumably because there are many tourists visiting the garden who are willing to pay the 50 dirham. The petit taxis have meters, but they are typically turned off when foreigners are involved, and we never succeeded in getting a single driver to turn on the meter in Marrakech despite asking repeatedly...just another issue to be aware of when getting to and from center."

The homage to Yves St Laurent was good too, but i was somewhat mystified as to why the monument to him was what appeared to be a piece of a doric column. There is a cafe inside, selling ice creams as well as food, but it is more pricey than the cafes which can be found very close to the entrance. We took about 2 hours to look round, and used a taxi to travel to it from our road in the medina (50 diram)"

This one was a late-comer to the city, having been planted in 1947 by a famous French furniture designer. It was later purchased and expanded by fashion mogul Yves Saint Laurent. It is a very peaceful and relaxing refuge from the busy city streets of Marrakesh. Particularly nice was the shady bamboo forest and the extensive cactus gardens. As an added bonus, there is a Berber museum within the grounds. This museum has many interesting displays about the culture and history of the native people of Morocco. Well worth a visit!!"

There was no space to relax as people asked you to move.. again for some more unoriginal pictures. Although there was a wide variety of plants it was to clinical and manicured to death. Amazing plants were carved with graffiti. The museum; although a nice thought and some great displays; did not leave you time to explore. Again too small and crowded.Full of pretentious tourists that appeared to come more for the name associated with the gardens than anything else.If you are on a budget I would not recommend this at all.

Save time also to visit the small but very informative Berber Museum on site. It is well done, and a nice compliment to the gardens. It can get quite crowded when multiple tour groups arrive together. Take time if you can to sit for a little bit in an out of the way spot until the crowd dies down; the garden soon becomes more peaceful, and easier to enjoy."

It was her birthday on the 12th May and we booked a holiday to beautiful Sardinia leaving on the 12th but few days before I got given this role which meant not only we had to cancel our holiday to Sardinia but I was going to be away nearly all week on her birthday, naturally she didnt want to go alone and equally she wasnt so keen on staying in London alone. Normally this isnt an issue but she is 5 months pregnant!! :)I managed to persuade the production to take her with me so she can relax by the pool while I am working and once I am finished we could enjoy Marrakech. Anyway I dont want to do this review of Marrakech as its another story so lets stick to Jardine Majorelle.I advice anyone not to go. I know die hard fans of the garden and Morrocco raising eye brows but stick with me till the end and I will tell from by perspective why so.Firstly its an odd place. Unless you are lucky and staying fairly close distance you will need to walk alot to get to it. While we are a nature mad, trekking, mountain climbing, canyon descending kind of family but at 40c plus 5 min walk equals to running circles in a sauna. You will need to get a taxi to and back. I strongly advice not to get a tour! it will add to the cost and disappointment. Again let me explain who we are. We live in London but not loving it, only for work. We do not like to live in any city. We are a nature kind of family and feel complete when we close to to the land, nothingness, plants and vegitation, mountains and rivers, animals, forests.. So going seen these gardens was on the top of our list as well as hiring a car and just driving out of marrakech towards the Ourika valley and river which we did! Its wonderful by the way but not to be included in this review.Anyways, the Garden is pretty with full of cactuses, money plants, massive bamboos, colours of the building are lovely.. But its only 50m square or something! Its tiny and I promise you we walked in in less than 10 minutes. I live in London, and have a small roof top, I promise you I have more flowers and rare birds coming to my garden than there are in Jardin Majorelle! Not to mention I have a resident Squirrel family living on my roof top. He is pain in my..... but thats another review.Yes literally you could do the round walk in less than ten minutes. And there is nothing to make you say Wow. Only good thing about it the staff that maintains the gardens which they do a great job and guides along the paths which are more than happy to take your camera and snap you mementos in every classical angle. The Museum is worth scene though only because they have incredible examples of early 19th century photographs of Berbers in Sahara and other photographs. Photographer in my gives 5 stars. cafe isnt too bad, lovely location tucked in that 50 m square! Food ok but thats another review on Morroccon food.So there you go, I know its only 50 dirhams which is about \u00a33.60 for the entry but its not the money but disappointment of expecting something grand which is not. I clicked late but you could actually stay outside when you finish and sell you tickets back to other poor tourists for half price, this would pay your taxi fares so you only lost out on your precious time :)1 star I gave to this not because its horrible but its just nothing amazing to worth the track and waste money and time. Most hotels have more plants and little pools and wild life than this garden. Oh just to let you know we went at 9.15 am last week to avoid tourists with white shorts and cameras but guess what, entire tourist population thinks the same. Garden is too small and We have not one photo without a tourist with a hate and camera not in it!I recommend hiring a car for about 300 dirhams, \u00a319 and drive towards to mountains. But that again you are never alone with the nature in Morrocco!!Would I go again to visit. Only to see Sahara."

After experiencing a \"way too much walking\" day on our first full day in Marrakech we decided to take it a little easier on Donna's reconstructed ankle. After some reviews my expectations were somewhat limited and measured about what to expect at this tourist site. We ended up spending more time than expected there and enjoyed it very much. The cactus and the bamboo are particularly impressive and we got some ideas about what to do with some of our spaces back home (many same plants). We paid the extra small fee for the Berber Museum and thought the collection informative. We ate a leisurely meal at the within the grounds restaurant which met our (again) measured expectations. All and all a delightful afternoon during a stifling, early May heat wave Marrakech suffered this year. I have marked this as a 1-2 hour attraction which I am guessing it will be for most visitors but we spent 3-4 there ourselves. So it all depends."

While the Medina and Jemma-al Fanah are bustling with tourists, food stalls and shops, this garden-cum-gallery-cum monument is a tranquil place, set in an elegantly upmarket locality of Marrakech - closer to the French side of the city. The place, originally conceived by Majorelle, was revived by famous designer Yves Saint Laurent who stayed and died here. The gardens, YSL's memorial are all brilliantly colour-coordinated with blue being the central theme. The place houses YSL's posters, designs and creations as well as his memorial. But what brings uniqueness is the gardens have an amazing collection of cactus. Local experts say it is one of the biggest cactus gardens in the world. A must-see. It is not an exhaustive trip and the entry fees are quite reasonable."

I think the gardens took us around an hour to walk through in total including a few breaks on the comfy benches. There is also a cafe in the middle which looked good. There is an interesting room full of pictures created by Yves Saint Laurent which was good to read and snap photos of. The only bad thing is that as it's such a big tourist spot in marrakech it is packed out so if you want to take photos you do spend a lot of time waiting for people to move out of the way or you find yourself ducking out of other people's photos!"

            "review": "Still the best garden in Marrakech - but this isn't difficult. The standards at Majorelle gardens had well and truly slipped since my last visit here 4-5 years ago. Then, the specimen plants were of the highest standard, all side shoots removed in relevant cases, and the gravelled beds were smart with raised rings of gravel around the plants highlighting the space between them. A genuine masterpiece. This time the quality of the plants had significantly dropped and the raised edging borders designed with little imagination with plants that can be picked up from your local supermarket. More asparagus ferns anybody? Substandard and deteriorating plants have been left in place and basel growth left unchecked resulting in an untidy appearance. Also, fewer gardens staff were seen this visit so perhaps cutbacks in maintenance have been put in place over the years to make the gardens more profitable for its owners. Surprisingly, and if my french translation is correct their leaflet boasts employing 90 staff at this attraction, but of those I only saw one doing any actual work in the gardens! In my opinion this is no longer the world class garden it once was. That being said, the shop, museum, cafe etc were just as good as before. If you want to see how it was in the good old days I have a link to my old photo album together with my original review from 2011 at: http://gardenofeaden.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/majorelle-gardens-morocco.htmlIts true when they say you should never go back...."

We decided to visit early as we'd heard it gets busy later it the day and we discovered this to be true. It was a relatively simple walk from our hotel to the gardens, although crossing the road was sometimes interesting. On our arrival we headed to the small cafe for a mint tea before spending a pleasant couple of hours strolling around the pretty well kept gardens. There are a lot of areas in the shade to sit and enjoy the sights and sounds, although if you're not a fan of blue you may get a little bit bored. Taking photographs does require a bit of patience as everyone is trying to get the same picture, but with pointed elbows it is possible to get some great shots. Overall I would recommend a visit to the gardens just don't go expecting European style formal gardens."

The shade of the overhanging trees offer shade in the afternoon and it's a good half hour stroll around the gardens, however they are smaller than expected, and we also had presumed maybe there would be space to have a picnic as such, but it is solid stone paths so no such luck. The gift shop and gallery are brilliant and although we didn't eat the little restaurant looked incredible (but pricey). Would get 5 stars if the admittance price got you into the house as well as that is extra."

Alas for me the experience is somewhat spoiled by the hordes of tourists navigating the garden's narrow walkways. If you are looking for an oasis of calm you will be bitterly disappointed, and your time is probably better spent visiting the fantastic gardens of La Mamounia. Nonetheless it is worth a visit if you are in the area..."

Majorelle has beautiful grounds and is a peaceful place to be if you go when it opens (9.30am) - at around 11am it starts to get a little too full of tourists which disturbs the tranquillity. I would recommend a visit, and I enjoyed the museum too. It's quite small but interesting. Look out for the plastic guide sheets explaining the exhibition in English, otherwise most of the signage is in French."

First of all, if you're a typical Botanical-gardens kind of person, please be realistic and do not expect a huge area from Jardin Majorelle.I spent two beautiful hours in this garden as I was there before it opened its doors and the tourist buses haven't even arrived. I read tips here on TA that there will be alot of tourist buses after 10am so I came very early on my last day in Marrakech. I decided to see this before I left back home as I wanted an oasis, away from the crazy Medina, souhks and the crazy people traffic at the main square. I wanted to destress from all the buzz I saw and I was very glad to have not missed this place.If you like relaxing in gardens, sitting on a bench, making a sketch or perhaps just watching blooms and cactuses....then this is for you. If you're just here to take selfies, then this is not the stop for you (aside from the area where you can take a photo of the blue house). But for those who actually love greenery, you will enjoy it here....IF you go very early! I found it very amazing to see every single detail from the lense of my camera. I believe if you only make the effort looking into the details, you will very much appreciate Jardin Majorelle....very, very much indeed :) When I showed photos of this garden to my husband and his family, they felt they needed to go to Marrakech only for this....such a beautiful oasis! TIP:Do NOT take the cabs outside the gardens....not even the small ones or the mercedes ones. The mercedes ones takes large groups and the small ones takes solo travellers like myself or couples. They are a rip off! Grab one at the main road, just a two minute walk from the gardens and ask that the meter to be run. I had no problems whatsoever and paid a quarter of what the cabbies were asking outside the gardens ;)"

Art deco style and painted in garish blue and yellow, it may not be to everyone's taste, but I loved it. Totally different to anything else you'll see in Marrakech, it's well worth visiting."

Ah, it has a covered aquarium with a few colored fishes and this is an excellent place to take a 5 - 10 minutes brake in the shade and take it in. Worth visiting Good luck"

The gardens are predominately green due to a high volume of cacti and other desert plants and the memorial to Yves SL is a little underwhelming but the Berber museum is an excellent exhibition of the various styles of dress from the different regions and the pieces of YSL artwork are fun.Walking back to the Medina takes less than 15 minutes so taxis are not necessary.Beautiful if somewhat pricey caf\u00e9/restaurant."

I arrived at around midday and there was a large queue. The ticketing staff kept the queue moving along quickly though, so it wasn't long til I was in the gardens. Entry to the gardens is Dh50, with an additional Dh25 to go into the museum (opening times vary throughout the year so check the website http://jardinmajorelle.com/ang/).The gardens themselves are not that large so if you are not that interested in cactus and plants, you may not spend long there. If you are interested in the history of Morocco and the various groups that have shaped it into the country it is today, then I highly recommend you get a ticket to the museum which exhibits the many differences between the tribal groups within Morocco, from clothing and jewellery through to language and living arrangements.

The gardens are so beautiful and the striking, cobalt blue colour is my absolute favourite, so it was easy for me to fall in love with this paradise. We would've likely wanted to take more pictures but with the amount of people it was very hard. It is definitely worth a stop and I completely understand why it's rated #1 in Marrakech.

We visited in the spring and many trees and plants were blooming. No a large garden area but visually and spiritually appealing. Get there early before the tour buses come in. We were there an hour after they opened. it was not crowded. We were enjoying the peace and quiet which gardens are great for when suddenly a flood of people came in. It continued for over an hour and then we left.We walked from our Riad in the medina and it was not that far. We also walked from the gardens to a restaurant called the Amal Moroccan Restaurant and Women's Training Center which is another great experience. Beware of taxi drivers around the garden exits. We started to take a taxi to the Amal. One driver wanted 60 MAD to take us. I had him show me on the map where he was taking us and I knew he was going to the wrong part of the city. He argued with me and then we just decided to walk using my phone's GPS system. It was a 10 minute walk from the garden."

The stunning Jardin Majorelle is well worth a visit although we got there late (around 5pm and closes at 6pm) so only had an hour. The garden was created in the 1930\u2019s by artist Jacques Majorelle and restored in the 1980\u2019s by Yves Saint Lauren and if you need to take some time and sit somewhere tranquil, this is the place. Until hearing the call to prayer, I\u2019d forgotten how close we were to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech, and hearing this muffled by the garden, added to the atmosphere and experience. As we were staying in the Medina, got here on the hop on/hop off \u2018bus touristique\u2018; on the \u2018Tour Historique\u2019 route. Although you could get closer on the \u2018Tour Oasis\u2019 bus within the same price, we had just missed one so rather than wait 1/2 hour for the next, walked from stop no. 1 near the Office de tourism which took about 10 minutes.You could pay a little extra to see The Berber Museum but given the time, we didn't do that but did have a lovely mint tea in the lovely little courtyard caf\u00e9."

It is reasonably small but I wouldn't let this put you off, it's nice to have a seat and escape from the busy city outside. The museum (again smallish) was interesting and worthwhile. We had a nice lunch at a small restaurant called Pause Gourmand just outside. Would go again."

Frankly, I have a hard time to understand how is it possible that this place ranks so high on Trip Advisor. Here are the facts: it is a very, very small garden (I believe less than 400m x 400m!) yet it cost 50 Dirham (about 5 euro) to enter. The only thing in there are some exotic plants (mainly cactuses!) and bus loads of tourists walking around in that small place. If you have been to any other city in the world with a botanic garden, then give this place a miss because it will not be anything special. And you won't find any locals there! Only tourists go there!Besides, there is the challenge of getting there, with taxis charging at least 10 euro for a one-way trip. Personally, I decided to walk there from the Medina: it was a very enjoyable walk, passing through lots of cafes and local neighbourhood, and is less than 2km. So in my case, it was the journey there (rather than the destination) which made it worth it :-)"

Then you see a lot of varieties of Cactus and other trees. Through out the path, trees provide shade from the sun. In the middle, there is a pond having white and pink lotus flowers, charm little tortoises and fishes. At the end of the trip, you see like a climax - variety of trees, colored Bougainvillea flowers, gigantic cactus plants providing you a scenery worth memorable.

It is beautiful if you like plants, and the date palms are really amazingly tall. Look out for the terrapins in the ponds."

They were looking at it as a possible lunch spot to include on their itinerary for their very wealthy clients. We found scores of people in the garden itself, everyone taking the obligatory photos, and in the restaurant section there was no place left to sit. Basically, we just walked in and walked out and they crossed it off their list for lunch (would up choosing Dar Moha instead.

Inside the garden is lovely but very overcrowded which made it impossible to really enjoy. The Berber Museum is interesting and far less crowded (there is an extra charge to get in). The 'gallery' is a small collection of YSL's 'Love' posters - colourful, derivative (especially Matisse) and unremarkable. Not sure it was worth it - if you time it to go without the crowds it would be a much better experience."

The foliage is complimented by the use of colourin this peaceful oasis, but I'd suggest going early or perhaps later in the afternoon when its not too busy. As we arrived a school trip was leaving so it wasn't too noisy and as the afternoon wore on we found the gardens became very peaceful and the colours used in the gardens become more vibrant as the sun goes down. We also had drinks in the little cafe garden which was very nice. We visited the museum in the garden which was twice the price of visiting the gardens alone, and whilst it was quite interesting, you don't really miss much by not going in - and a shop which sells overpriced objects in the style of Yves St Laurent, but is in fact NOT Yves St Laurent! I'd say visit the gardens for definite and if you really want to see a lot of really old berber tools and costumes, before finding the well disguised YSL shop then go for it!."

The gardens are kept to a wonderful standard and the whole place really was beautiful and so unlike most botanical gardens.

Just about every guide book will tell you to visit the Jardin Majorelle during a trip to Marrakech, and it does deliver by way of a lush garden setting with its famous striking colours. On the whole we thought it was over-touted and over-priced, although of course not by European standards. With entry at 50 dirhams (5 euros) it was the most expensive place we went to, with sites such as the magnificent Saadian Tombs and Ben Youssef Medrasa charging only 10 dirhams (1 euro). So it is clearly a tourist magnet and exploited as such. Taxis will overcharge to get there, caleches will pester you for a ride, and of course there will be many, many visitors, especially at peak times. The best time to go is as early as possible, before the first coaches arrive.The cafe looks delightful but is also expensive - there are other options outside the gardens, if you make it through the barrage of taxi drivers wanting to take you to your next destination.If garden are your thing, go to the Mammounia Hotel (dress sensibly), where access is free, and you can even enjoy a delightful cappuccino on the terrace while star-spotting. The cappuccino costs as much as the entry ticket to the Majorelle but that would be my choice.And by the way, talking of 'gardens', don't bother with the much-touted Menara gardens, where there is little to see apart from the 'famous' pavilion and pool. But at least they are free too."

So there's no point in getting there after the morning as it is too packed to appreciate properly. We got there at about 9pm, which was fine, but on our way out it was filling up and the ticket queue was round the street. Don't pay for the museum or cafe. Too expensive and not worth it.Don't pay more than 50 dirhams for a taxi from outside jemaa el fna. It isn't a long journey and tourists can get ripped off. Always agree the price with the driver before getting in the taxi. You can walk back or else there are lots of taxis in the area to catch.Overall, it's a beautiful place with a juxtaposition of vibrant colours, including the beautiful blue sky, that is unlike any other place. Definitely a must visit if you're in Marrakesh and be sure to take your time walking round and take loads of photos. If you walk quickly you'll do the whole thing in 15 minutes, but you'll regret not capturing more images to remind you of how stunning it was once you get home."

Its an interesting walk from the centre as you pass through the sights and smells of a huge fruit and vegetable market. The restaurant is obviously designed for the tourist wallet but offers a good selection of traditional food - there are a few restaurants just outside the walls of the garden too. Don't bother with a taxi there and back, just walk and enjoy the diversity Marrakesh has to offer the visitor."

You step through the gate and what meets you first is the colour green, everywhere you look. Then you notice the vivid blue of the artefacts and structures that adorn the gardens. Only when you get over this smothering of colour do you then start to notice the astonishing blend of bamboo, palm, cactus and so much more. It's cool too - not in the trendy sense, as you seem to lose awareness of yourself, but in the sense that the temperature inside seems so much more bearable when it's stifling outside. I love this place and will definitely return."

The garden features many species but has a huge number of cacti and euphorbia (cactus-like spiny desert plants.) The surroundings are idyllic. There is a small but excellent museum of Berber artifacts. After Majorelle died, Yves St. Laurent, the celebrated French fashion designer bought the Majorelle and kept it in a trust so after his death, it would be maintained. This is a real gift to the world. Do not miss the museum, which has a small selection of the costumes St.Laurent acquired, as well as videos of Berber life. The museum is extraordinary--one room makes you feel you are in the open desert under the stars, but it's a trick of mirrors and lights. Incredible. Do. NOT. MISS!!!"

Hosting an impressive collection of exotic plants collected from Majorelle's travels around the world, you can feast your eyes on the stunning cactus and yucca plants, coconut, banana and bamboo trees, water lilies and white water lilies, water fountains and ponds and of course his villa paint in \"Majorelle Blue\"; a striking ultramarine blue he created in 1937 and used to adorn the large ceramic jars dottted around the garden. Small but enchanting and well worth the visit. There is also a museum of Tamazigh culture which I did not visit."

The whole garden has been revamped and the cacti, palms and succulents are beautifully set off against a background of coloured pathways and iridescent blue paintwork - Sounds rather 'in your face' but in typical YSL style, it works amazingly. Entrance is in the side road (turn left where the horse drawn carriages are situated and its about 100 yrds on the left - mind the smell of the horses as that can really take the romance out of the carriage idea!) Great place and definitely worth going"

Took some brilliant photos here, and I didn't want to leave. There is a gorgeous little restaurant/cafe within the garden, enclosed within a brick courtyard, the atmosphere is special and the place extremely pretty. The food was good (mixed morrocan salad/ club sandwich). A highlight of the gardens is the love gallery, such vibrant colours. If I am ever lucky enough to return to this amazing city I am returning here. One of the nicest experiences I have had. We also paid to visit the small museum, the clothing and jewelry on display is interesting, but the exhibition is a lot smaller than we had anticipated.

There are so many photographic opportunities but so many visitors make it hard to get that perfect shot. Leave your cares at the door and meander along the pathways. Do not be in a hurry."

An attractive garden, it's true, with great specimens of cacti and tropical plants from various corners of the globe, in a tranquil setting.But they are really playing off the history of Yves Saint Laurent owning it and living there. They charge 50 dirhams per person for entry - for comparison, most cultural sights in Marrakech are around the 10 dirham mark - and there's very little to hold your attention. A quick walk around (10-15 minutes) and you're done, with very little in the way of information about the plants etc. The house within the garden has been converted into an interesting exhibit of Berber art and clothing, but you have to pay an extra 25 dirhams for this, and I really feel it should be included in the price of entry to the garden.One tip - if you do go, head there early in the day - when we left at about 1030-1100 it was starting to get crowded and there was a long queue at the gate."

The price (50Dh) is not \"cheap\" if you compare to Arsat Moulay Abdaslam (which is also very nice, but free), but the beauty and harmony of the place more than make up for it. Birds chirping, away from the noise of the city, with lush green surroundings and vividly coloured buildings and pots, this place is a work of art (it is, after all, the garden of Jacques Majorelle, a painter). I could've spend the entire day there if I had had the chance. Tip: avoid the caf\u00e9 in the garden if you can (and most caf\u00e9s in the area, for that matter); it's very expensive. A 5min walk outside the garden will bring you to nice caf\u00e9s for half the price."

The gardens feature and impressive collection and palms and cacti from all over the world. My only complaint would be graffiti carvings in some of the plants should be dealt with. If you are only in Marrakech for one night I'm not sure you would find it necessary to trek out there and miss all the action inside the medina. But by the third day I would say it's a welcoming break."

The garden is beautiful and really makes you feel like you are somewhere else entirely. There are lots of Palm trees and cactus, and they keep everything manicured to perfection. The actual garden is not huge, but there are many different paths that you can take through, as well as a cafe and museum to see while you our there. Our family enjoyed the 90 minute detour, and would recommend it to others if the crowds get to you in the Medina."

And do if time allows a stop for the cafe the food is excellent and well worth it."

The gardens are exremely well designed and landscaped and the coloured pots really make the place a great place to be. I also enjoyed the museum inside the gardens. Although very small, the museum is informative, interesting and high quality. The book store and shop though are outrageously overpriced with random books costing up to \u00a3100, so this can be ignored. Note the taxi dirvers outside will try ripping you off in price: the cost from here to the medina is under 50 and to outskirt hotels ~70."

Exotic plants from around the world were there. They were well looked after and user friendly for visitors with shaded corridors and seats, dotted around. The museum, on the other hand, is well worth visiting as it gave us a very in depth understanding of the Berber history and culture. Do not miss the gallery where YSL's LOVE greeting cards over the years were on display. We took pictures of the ones significant in our life, e.g. marriage, births etc. The cards actually gave an indication of changing times, colours and popular culture of the different years.

Would definitely recommend a visit, but be warned it is quite far outside of the city - after a long hike in the mountains we were very close to ordering a taxi back but managed to stumble back to our riad, about a 30/45 minute journey on foot."

The small Berber museum within the park villa is the most interesting feature"

There was something incredibly calming about them - really peaceful and we had a pleasant, relaxing stroll.I read a review that said 'not worth paying for' and I understand the comment, but it only worked out at about \u00a33 each so I really don't think it breaks the bank! It is worth the entry fee to keep the gardens open. The cafe, however, was expensive by Moroccan standards and we chose not to eat there.We spent about 30 minutes wandering around the cactus' and I don't think you could spend much longer unless you visited the cafe.It made a pleasant change from the hustle and bustle of the shops and markets."

Formal gardens are contrived but meticulously planned and laid out, this one neither fits the formal nor the planned, with 'specimens' spread out on an ad hoc basis. Beautifully tended. The best part of the garden is the cactus plantation, which is impressive. Lovely shop, pricey, but top quality compared with elsewhere. The gardens are worth going to if you can't find anything else to do or you need a break from the noise, but it's a paying experience which is OK but not great, it gets quite crowded with visitors and coach trips, all jostling on the narrow paths. It's a small place so you will not be alone to enjoy the tranquility."

Hence there is a monument to him in a quiet corner.We particularly liked the museum. Although small, the displays were stunning, especially the jewellery in a 'starlit ' room with mirrors, and the range of costumes worn by people in different parts of Morocco, shooing woven and embroidered materials. There's a book shop, a cafe and a shop selling beautiful examples of Moroccan crafts of high quality. Outside the garden Marrakech is such a contrast; step inside for an oasis in the city."

When we arrived the gardens were still peaceful and quiet, which is exactly what you want in comparison to the hustle, bustle and sometimes hassle of the medina area. It is about 5 minutes in a taxi from Djemma El Fna. The gardens are not big, and I imagine in the height of summer perhaps not so peaceful either as we visited at a fairly quiet time of year just before Christmas. The colours are so vibrant and I don't think I have ever seen such an immaculately clean and orderly garden before. There are many benches to sit on and listen to the trickling of water fountains. The Berber museum on site was also an interesting diversion and the star lit room made me \"wow\" on entry. A lovely why to start off the day."

Definitely worth a visit."

Even though the garden is very well looked after and maintained meticulously, to my personal taste it looked rather plain. I believe to remember that there were fountains and waterways made of mosaics. Today everything is painted blue. Even flower pots are painted blue and yellow. Yes, the garden is still a magnet for tourists. However, I would rather say it is a mausoleum to Yves St. Laurent."

With a 50mad entry fee and an extra 25mD fee for the museum I'd expect something worth while. First, the garden is small, you could walk the one path in under 10 minutes. While walking you will see variety of cacti and a plethora of Europeans taking pictures of those cacti with their cell phones and iPads. There is only one circular path in the garden, but map is provided so you don't get lost. After you pay homage to Yves Saint-laurent, who is commemorated by a rock, you can look at the Berber museum, which is the size of small house and will require you to wait in line, which for us took over 30 minutes. Don't worry, when you leave the park any cab driver there will ad 30mad to the fair because he or she will have had to pay to park in the taxi stand.The only upside, and there reason this got 2 stars from me, is that there is a liquor store right next to the entrance."

After travel and the first experience of the Medina and Souks on our arrival day we needed a break from the hustle and bustle and thought the Gardens seemed ideal! We walked all the way from the heart of the Median which was absolutely fine with regard to distance (even with a 5 year old) albeit dusty although a bit mad traffic wise, so entering the Gardens was an amazing experience - green, lush and calm! One of the first places you see is the Bamboo grove which is very impressive. We were lucky and early and could sit on one of the benches and just look up, which was fantastic. There is a pathway through the gardens but plenty opportunity to stop, look, enjoy, take, photos ... Marrakech is overall quite hectic but this was a really tranquil and peaceful break.The colours are amazing and the Majorelle blue of the museum at the back of the Gardens creates a wonderful contrast to the green. Our little boy especially loved the cacti secion where we spent a lot of time.We walked around for more than an hour and were really sad to leave. Personally I could have happily walked around for longer, it's such a wonderful oasis!"

When you buy your ticket to the gardens, make sure you also get a ticket to the Berber museum. While small, it is very impressive and well curated and on display is an amazing collection of traditional dress and jewellery.

There were plants from all over the world not just this region. I found the museum very interesting. Each room had an English card to translate the signs. The displays were well designed and informative. The gardens fill up early do go when they first open. Also in the winter bring jacket it's quite cool in the shade.We spent about 45 minutes in the garden and museum. We could have spent a little longer, but not much.

No mean feat given I was interested in it from a design and Architecture pov and he ( having recently completed a book on ecological restoration) is interested in gardens from a plants and nature pov. We were both blown away by its beauty ( and despite its small size and crowds) it's meditative ambience. The stunning colours were shown at their best in the clear, soft December sunlight we were lucky enough to have on our visit. It also has a lovely outdoor cafe, and a very fine gallery exhibiting YSLs Love poster designs plus a small photo and book store. The Berber museum ( reviewed seperately) is well worth a visit also. The shop has some ( as one would expect) very fine and beautifully designed pieces but is very expensive. Near the Jardins, a street of cool designery small stores have opened varying in quality - but worth a look. Overall, a chance to visit these gardens should not be missed."

We decided to get out of the old city to get some peace away from the hassle and filth of the souks. The gardens are only a few acres and are certainly well maintained and have a nice selection of cacti. Unfortunately most of the plants are unlabelled and unlike scientific gardens, there is no recognition of a particular geographical biosphere. There are plants from various continents planted together. I found Marrakech totally uninspiring and this was undoubtedly the best part of it. It's a shame it's so small. Mo"

It's incredible how peaceful the gardens are despite their location in the middle of a city. There is an amazing cactus section of the garden and I loved the Colbalt Blue Building which houses the gift and book shops. One a side note the gift shop is super expensive! I think it trades of YSL's name but I certainly wouldn't pay the prices they were asking for jewellery and scarfs. We're talking hundreds and sometimes thousand of pounds which for me is ridiculous.

A huge collection of cacti and other flowering plants (some against the very vivid cobalt blue backdrops) arranged very thoughtfully, which makes for an excellent meditation on aesthetics and provides myriad opportunities for picture-taking. The entry fee is expensive (by Moroccan standards), but the experience worth it. Interesting bookstore on the grounds as well as a boutique, and a restaurant that serves excellent (though overpriced) juice concoctions. Probably best to go in the morning when there are not masses of tourists, though when we went -- at noon or later -- the garden was not overly busy. Good place to spend a few hours; great way to dodge the frenzy of the medina for a while."

I had expected the gardens to be larger but wasn't disappointed. There was an air of peace and calm as you walk through. I spent about 2 hours there, including the museum and bookstore, which I found very professional and extremely interesting about the Berber culture. A wonderful place to escape to after the hecticness of the Marrakech square. I could have easily spent more time there, sitting/reading/relaxing and having a coffee in the cafe.I was a little disappointed that we weren't able to walk around the residence, which is now closed off."

The garden is naturally small and contains many desert plants arranged around simple water features like fountains. There is a cool aspect to it though as it has bamboo and a few imported plantsthat surround a koi pond. In the garden, the heat and noise of the city evaporate and despite the gardens taking maybe an hour -it is well worth the calming change of pace. Do not miss the berber museum - bright blue cobalt building -and the gallery beyond. They are small but give a nice insite to the local culture (Note the museum is all in French so bring a guide book if you don't understand the panels). Worth the visit."

The Berber Museum (25 DH) and bookstore are also fabulous - very well presented."

One waiter was a bit 'straighty-one-eighty' and the other offered a more friendly, enthusiastic service. Food was good, slightly 'expensive' for Morocco but the best part was their flexibility on payment - they accept card and euros. As for the garden: beautiful and interesting. Especially loved the fact that it used to be maintained by Yves Saint Laurent & his partner. The Love gallery is cute. Berber Museum is beautifully displayed and well thought-out. Great spots for photos and overall a memorable experience."

Odd place as you're dropped off on a main road and the entrance is down a side street where you immediately spot other tourists. 75Dh for entry and the Berber museum - worth both. It is a beautifully maintained garden which, but for the other tourists ( though to be fair we were there in November so it wasn't unduly packed) is quiet and restful and set out lovingly: the bamboo forest is wonderful and then the other array of cacti, agave, money plants, aloe vera, tree ferns to die for and the strikingly beautiful colour of the pavilion which has been made into the museum - it's hard to miss the blue! Museum was interesting and tries, in a relatively small space, to cram a fair bit of Berber context together. The cafe in the courtyard behind the museum pavilion is lovely and calm, food choices were good, fairly priced with good service. If you go anywhere in Marrakech, go here!"

We got a horse-drawn taxi from the Kasbah region at the south of the city up to the gate nearest the gardens, Bab Moussoufa (cost us 200 Dirhams - about \u00a314 - although we haggled that down from 300 Dirhams each!) and walked up Boulevard Allal Al Fassi and along Avenue Yacoub el Mansour. We decided to walk back to our Riad in the Kasbah, which took about 45 minutes. Entry to the gardens was just over a fiver a head, and you could walk round the whole lot in under an hour - but we sat and took in the view, enjoyed the quiet and contemplated the evening ahead. The Yves Saint Laurent memorial was neither here nor there, but the cactus gardens and fountain area were truly beautiful and very photogenic.

The plants are exotic cacti, succulents, palms, bougainvillea and much more with waterways / pool / terrapin and a Cafe that offers superb food especially the Tajine Kefta - meaballs and egg! In season, can imagine Majorelle is bustling with tourists however there were few tourists the day of our visit which added to the calm, cool, tranquillity of this small, intimate space. The choice of shrine to Yves Saint Lauren is not as expected. Sadly the Berber museum wasn't opened however it was simply delightful to sit, relax and drink in all the beauty. Very impressive and definitely recommended."

It gave us great inspiration for our new garden. Worth the effort to go there. If you look through gates and over walls you can see where YSL lived as what we are allowed you see is but a small Portion of the real garden. Walk around the block and see the now tired pillared entrance to the real house. The neighbours on the back street have even made an effort and created nice cactus and Palm front bays. Some of the security staff will offer to take pictures of couples together for a small tip of course but they do it in just the right way, waiting respectfully without hustling. 5dm for the service should be more than enough as he does it 1 couple per two minutes or thereabouts so is on a good earner!This time of year is great to visit Marrakesh as the weather is still warm but not cold and certainly not scorching. As always ignore the taxi touts outside, walk round the corner and get a real cab back to town by the petrol station. Far cheaper. 30-40 DM back to main square.Nearby to the garden entrance is a great cafe called Kaowa which serves really nice burgers and the most enormous quiche plus good juices. Not cheap but good quality and smart service worthy of any place in Europe.. Well worth a break there. There is also a boutique shop selling nice stuff but bloody expensive. Upmarket Parisian style with prices to match. Really nice metal cactus....yes metal cactus but at eye watering prices. No haggling here as everything is priced and labelled which is nice after days of laughable prices in the Medina."

We were rather late arriving and had only 1 hour before it closed. It's rather expensive to go in, 50 D's and more if you want to go into the museum. There is a lot happening in a fairly small space. The garden is well set out with particular plants in each area and brightly coloured pots everywhere. The are ponds with water lilies . Everything is closely packed. There is the usual shop selling very expensive goods and a cafe."

The Majorelle gardens situated in the Ville Nouvelle area of Marrakech were laid out by the French painter, Jacques Majorelle in the twenties and thirties, and after his death in the early sixties were taken over by Yves Saint Laurent, before passing into trust after his death.The gardens which can be visited in around one/two hours offer a calm oasis from the bustle of the city. The gardens feature bamboo groves, cactus gardens, and numerous pools, as well as the striking cobalt blue house itself. Entrance is 50 Dirham (children under nine go free) with an additional 25 Dirham if you want to visit Saint Laurent's collection of Berber craftwork which is housed in Majorelle's former studio.

There is a monument in the garden to Yves St Laurent."

After a wander around the gardens we stopped at the cafe for a drink and were pleasantly surprised at the unique selection of teas and cold drinks on offer. We tried two of the cold milk drinks, one made with dates and orange blossom and the other with almonds, dates and avocado - they were delicious and we want to try recreating them now we're home!

The Majorelle Garden was one of the few attractions in Marrakech that I had not visited over the years and I wanted to rectify this omission at the end of a 14 day photo tour of southern Morocco. I visited mid-afternoon expecting the best light of the day and not knowing what to expect. In the event, I found that much of this magnificent garden is in shade and could perhaps be best visited earlier in the day when the light is higher. However, the major exception is the area comprising the exterior of the Berber museum and the adjoining ponds. The building is painted in the trademark deep Taureg blue with caramel coloured panels to the doors and window grilles - all of which is absolutely stunning in the late afternoon! There are so many delightful views (= photo opportunities) as you stroll round the gardens.Following my visit deep into Berber lands, it was wonderful to visit the garden's Berber museum with costumes and fantastic jewellery from many of the areas that I had just visited. The museum's presentation which looks like a galaxy of stars is just amazing!I was also fascinated by the number of original black and white photo prints that dated back to early 1900's and were for sale in the garden shop. There were also many items of YSL inspired quality available to purchase.Overall, I expected a brief visit to the gardens but ended being completely enchanted by all that was being shown. Thank you - a delightful experience!"

This is a complete haven from the madness of 'Kesh and well worth the 50dh entrance fee (museum is 25dh extra). Any photos you have seen just do not do this place justice - even the graffiti on the bamboo and cacti are now part of the whole experience. Unfortunately tho this is still ongoing and on the 2 trips we made there was very fresh carvings on some of the cacti - the security is not enough to stop it. Make sure you allow time to have a meal at the cafe - the food is some of the best we had in the 2 weeks we were in 'Kesh and reasonably priced as well."

After spending 5 euros for admission to the garden I expected more. It is basically a maze of cactuses and palm trees with the odd water feature. It has the potential to be peaceful (especially compared to Marrakech's medina) but it is somewhat lessened by being filled with tourists all looking for the reason entry cost 5 euros. We didn't go into the museum, so perhaps this is the draw, but it costs extra."

The gardens are very well kept with plenty of seats available to sit and enjoy. We visited in the morning and whilst there were others there it didn't feel busy.There is a nice little cafe where we stopped for some mint tea, they also served lunch which looked good. The waiters were polite and the service we received was good. The only downside was that the Berber museum was closed when we visited......................oh and the guy in the ticket booth was brusque and rude when we bought our admission ticket.............he did not represent the ambience and beauty of the gardens at all!"

The upkeep of this place is amazing.the plant life from all over the world especially south and central America that thrives on that garden is beautiful.

You can glimpse the hot African sky beyond, but there is a lot of shelter here. There is a museum of Berber life which you should not miss and the combination of palms, cacti and succulents are beautifully displayed and cared for. In all but the most fierce of temperatures, this is walkable from the city centre, but the open top bus will take you to within a mile or so. I enjoyed the best salad ever in the restaurant, so don't believe what some critics say about the cost and value. A fine spray of water refreshes you every few seconds. Delightful.

He bought it and ask for the help of other artist to give it a new life. It's definetely a must-see because of the gardens, because of the pots are painted with the famous Saint-Laurent colours (blue, yellow, fashionistas and lovers of fashion will remember which nuance I am referring to), because the Berber museum, even if a small one, is well-conceived and designed. One must add that Marrakech has still a lot to learn as far as the (western) concept (I admit) of a museum is concerned...but the Museum settled in the Jardin Majorelle is a must-seen too...I would say that this is a nice place to visit when the temperature is rising...."

The planting features a huge range of cacti and many sub-tropical shrubs and trees. The design is distinctive, with a lily pond and other water features, and there is much use of pastel colour but also of that wonderful lapis lazuli blue. It isn't a huge place - you could scurry round in ten minutes, but that would of course miss the point, which is to enjoy the tranquillity of a special place. Indeed, we would have stayed for longer but it was close to closing time when we left."

While it's refreshing to find a garden like this in Marrakech, I didn't quite understand the great reviews.Pros -Scenic enough small garden for a half hour stroll. Surprisingly had bamboo plants near the entrance, giving it an Asian vibe. Had a pretty pond in the back. Cons -Most of the garden consisted of various cactus, spaced fairly far apart. While there were some picturesque spots (esp near the front and all the way in the back), the majority of it seemed a bit deserted, which may be apropos for that region of the world, but did not leave much of an impression on me. Maybe I am simply jaded. It is also very small and you can easily stroll through in less than half an hour.It's quite a good distance from Jemaa el Fna and cabbies will try to swindle you to get there. Definitely do not pay more than 30 dirhams to get here!"

The colors and plants are so vibrant and the history is also interesting. There is a museum inside the gardens with Berber artifacts, I'd definitely recommend checking it out as well. It costs extra, but it is well worth it. It is one of the better designed museums I've ever been to. You can really see how Yves Saint Laurent was influenced by the Berber textiles, jewelry etc. A word of advice, the garden can get very crowded, our Riad recommended going after noon, we went at 11 because our morning plans fell through and it was packed. By the time we finished with the museum etc. it was afternoon and the crowd had cleared out considerably."

There were literally queues forming, just for people to take their one snap, then shuffle onto the next one. Had we arrived a few hours earlier and been able to walk round at our own pace and soak up the atmosphere and incredible popping colour of this place (blues, yellows, greens) I think we would have enjoyed it much more.It's also worth noting that the Jardin Majorelle isn't near a single other thing. You will need to take a taxi/horse & carriage there AND back. It's a long, long walk to the next sight. And no bars/restuarants of note to enjoy before or after."

And yes, there is a nice little blue house in it, and there is a small expo about the fantastic designer Yves Saint Laurent. But that's it. Actually you can visit it in 10 minutes or less, as it is so small. And the entrance price has skyrocketed in last years, up to 50 dirhams now, plus an extra 25 for the house. That may not seem a lot, but as confirmed afterwards by local people we knew in Marrakech, the overall price was just 30 not so many years ago, and all other PUBLICLY held musea and so do only charge 10 dirhams.So for me this attraction is just not worth the money ... If you are in Marrakech and want to have a stroll in an amazing garden, go to the garden of the posh Mamounia hotel ... entrance is free, and it is like 5 times the size of the Jardin Majorelle ... it has an amazing cactuscollection, and an educating herbs and vegetables garden all the way in the back."

Created by the painter Majorelle and fashion pioneer Yves Saint Laurent, now owned by the Majorelle-YSL Foundation, the gardens are an absolute must-see in Marrakech. Rare plants from around Africa and the Mediterranean are proudly displayed against a pastiche of YSL colours, including the beautifully-vivid deep blue which is characteristic of the garden. These are then supplemented by superb architecture which stresses the harmony and tranquility of the Majorelle Gardens, despite a throng of tourists constantly photographing themselves in every possible direction.The gardens have a DH50 MAD entrance fee, and for an extra DH25 MAD you may also buy entrance to the small, but still interesting, Berber Museum. The Museum features images, objects and textiles from Morocco's Berber heritage, alongside a delightful little gift shop with a broad range of French and English books. This is supplemented again by the nearby Garden-wide gift shop, which sells fabrics, paints (such as the YSL blue), metal objects and literature... all at the price characteristic of a famous European fashion label. Certainly a nice place to visit, if only to take some of the heat away from your day and relax in the mist-covered Jardin Majorelle cafe. A great must-see for the beautiful plants, architecture, colours and landscaping."

The gardens, walkways and ponds are immaculate, and burst with assorted ferns, bamboos and cacti. The sound of traffic disappears as soon as you enter ...There is also a wonderful museum dedicated to the tribes people of Morocco, featuring their clothing, jewellery and everyday treasures (beautiful wooden boxes, carved spoons etc rather than stuffy objets d'art) which you should definitely include on your entrance ticket. It takes about half an hour / three quarters of an hour to stroll through. There is a lovely cafe / restaurant in the midst of the gardens, for mint tea, coffee or even a full meal. Prices are moderate, not cheap.The area has recently been improved too, now offering a fabulous cafe (with brilliant coffee) and a range of small artisan shops. There is a wonderful bookshop too, offering both English and French language coffee table books on Morocco and north Africa. It has the most gorgeous wooden front, and is almost directly opposite the entrance to the gardens.One word of caution - DON'T take a taxi from outside (or even look as if you're the sort of person who might want a taxi). They will pretend to offer low prices, but then jack up the price as soon as you agree to go with them. It is distinctly unpleasant, and can be avoided by walking the 50 yards back to the main road and hailing a small taxi to take you into the city (no more than 30 dhirams)."

He was horrified to learn they were being bulldozed to make way for some concrete monstrosity! So.. He stepped in.. bought the land and over the years, honed it into the little oasis that is Marjorelle Gardens.It's 20dirahms in. I think 10 more for the museum tour which we didn't bother with. We were there purely for the shrubbery! The photo ops in here are ample but impossible with everyone wanting the same thing. Patience is a virtue if your a budding photographer and want that fab snap!This place is serenity.. lush bamboo growing; with lovers who've cheekily carved their initials into the bamboo or leaves of the Agarve plants growing here (they're used in tequila don't you know!). HUGE palm trees jut out of the canopy into blue skys! There's a hut just as you walk through the first part onto your right side that springs out into a long thin water feature that makes a great photo.Such variey her in foliage and fauna. So very tranquil even with all the tourists about.The gardeners are about tending to their pride and joys. They do smile at you- some any way lol. There's lots of staff wandering about too in bright blue t-shirts who'll always offer to snap you and a friend next to a 50ft cactus! The cactus's by the way...even though they look smooth they're really not. I put my hand on one and got HUNDREDS of tiny spines in my hand and were very painful and got all over my body!! I had to change my clothes when i got back to the hotel..DO NOT TOUCH!! There's no signs anywhere giving you that advise so be warned!!It's hot. REALLY hot. It's in the shade but still hot. There's benches dotted about so you can sit down. The little memorial plot for Yves Saint Laurent is simple in design. A lovely spot. But again, lots of tourists ooooing and aaahing at it.. If you look really closely you can spot turtles living amongst the water Lilly's!The cafe inside... #Looks# great. But we didn't eat there. Too expensive in our book! There was a much cheaper place directly outside the gardens called Kaowa! That did HUGE wraps and cold as ice smoothies for half the price. Don't waste money on a pretty place i say..It's there for sakes sake. Like the gift shop at the end of a museum. Kaowa people. There's toilets. No baby facilities at all... One poor lady was changing her newborn on the floor of the bathroom with tourists stepping over her!!!!! Not cool. The maid looked quite annoyed she was doing it but where the hell was she meant to go???!! Morocco is quite anti-baby and anti disabled i must say!It takes around an hour 30min to get a real sense of these gardens and why YSL saved them. A good deed i say! Sometimes city's NEED their greenery! A must see it's simply a lovely break from the car horns and and road fumes."

If you love plants and bold colours then this is definitely for you. It might seem odd to go to Marrakech a visit a garden developed by a foreigner but he was clearly inspired by his surroundings (among other things) and it shines through in his garden. It is delightful way to spend an hour or so, wandering around in the shade and admiring the many different species of plants carefully placed among pots, benches and walls all bursting with colour.A bit hard to find but worth the effort."

Firstly it was Yves private garden & then used to gather vegetation from around the world, mainly cactuses. It's such a beauty on its own!!!It's small & colourful, gives you the feeling of a little oasis within the dryness of Marrakesh & also links the town to its spanish past connection. A lovely vegetation display where you will also find a Berber Museum inside, at an extra cost of course.Worth the knowledge."

However, this is the sort of Garden that you bring a book with you and a good camera, find a spot you like and sit and enjoy for as long as you like. It isn't very big and I would guess you could rush around it all in 15 minutes, our guide gave us 45 minutes free time in the garden which gives you an idea. I thought that the cactus plants were amazing and the ones in flower stunning. As others have written the Caf\u00e9 is over priced, there was also a charge for the extra museum within the Garden which we were unaware of, 25Dhm pp. Although I think overall it should only be rated as average, that is mainly based on the fact I couldn't honestly say it was \"very good\", good possibly but very good I am not so sure. I enjoyed the Garden but wouldn't argue with those that have rated it either better or worse than I have. I wonder if it wasn't for the name YSL would it be as popular?"

Looking back at the photos of the Jardin Majorelle I am stunned by the colors and re-enchanted, though on the day it was too hot and too crowded for maximum enchantment. Unfortunate timing brought us on a day when there were two weddings and temps were the 100's. Benches were at a premium, so meandering was the only course of action. But don't let me bring you down, it's utterly gorgeous and unique. Don't miss it. The dose of intense coloration alone is worth the price of admission. The cafe was quite over priced, 45 dirhams for three or was it two? tiny boules of ice cream. At that point in the day any cold was considered a medicinal must have item."

            "review": "Go early. I must agree with some reviewers that the garden is slightly underwhelming. I find the whole concept of bringing plants from five continents together and cramp them all into a rather small space a little over-ambitious. If you have travelled the world a little, you won't find anything new or exciting here. I did like the indigo blue throughout the garden though. It seems unconventional if not disturbing at first but it works. It breaks up the garden into little focal points and eventually makes you look at the plants. Without the blue vases and structures, the whole garden would be pointless in my opinion. I also don't agree that the Yves Saint-Lauent memorial is laughable. He was a rather private and shy person, so a small pillar in his memory seems more fitting than a giant marble tomb. He did not want to elevate himself above a place and culture he loved, and this should be respected and appreciated.The key to appreciating the garden better and to see how the green and blue work together, is to either go very early in the morning or very late in the afternoon. We arrived at around 11am and it was a total zoo. Go either before 9am or after 4pm. In between it's more like summer sales in China.I believe the best part of the garden is the Berber museum inside. Most people don't want to pay another 25 dirham on top of the 50 dirham entrance fee for the garden. But that's a huge mistake. The museum provides an extraordinary insight into Berber culture and art. The majority of Moroccans are Berber, and we have to thank Pierre Berge and Yves Saint Laurent for an astonishing collection of art pieces. There's nothing like it anywhere in Morocco. While I would give the garden an average score, the museum is a straight five. If you have time for only two museums, it should be the Berber Museum and Maison de la Photographie."

Though, if you are looking for a bit of respite, like myself, from the busy lights of the city then this is the place to go. When inside you forget where you are, it is so quiet and tranquil.

It is a place where you can escape the noise and madness of the Souks and Medinas, a place you can find peace and tranquillity. It was the summer residence of the designer Yves Saint Laurent.I went with a dear friend a couple of years ago. She was recovering from a serious car accident, which sadly, her partner didn't survive. The garden has many many different species of plants, but notably cacti, set in the most beautiful gardens, and in the centre, the most magnificent bright blue house, that gleams with the clashing purple bougainvillia and bright blossoms that surround it.My mother used to collect cacti when I was a child, and seeing these magnificent plants suddenly reminded me of her. I felt sad, and a little reflective and tearful. I turned to my friend, and said, \"I'm having a moment abut my Mum...\" She turned to me and said \"Today would have been Nick's Birthday.\" We hugged, and shed some tears, but in the most beautiful, peaceful, healing space.We went on to have delicious freshly squeezed juices in the lovely cafe, and there is a shop which sells a particular brand of Saint Laurent perfume that my friend can only get there. So whenever we go to Marrakech, we have to go to the Jardins Majorelle to restock her supply!There is a little gallery with some lovely samples of Yves Saint Laurent's artwork, books, and photos of Marrakech.It is best to get there early, or certainly out of season, as it can get quite crowded, which does rather spoilt the lovely peace and calm."

The gardens were nice and given the current exchange rates cheap to visit, but I thought they would be a bit more extensive. For a \"round the world\" garden there were a lot of cactii (which were fascinating in their variety), but felt it lacked a bit. It was though very pleasant to walk around and an oasis from the heat and bustle of Marrakesh. But... get the dual ticket to involve the Berber Museum. It may have only been four rooms, but it was fascinating and we spent a long time in there. It gave a really good insight into the background and history of the whole area and was well worth the visit, with informative displays of how the people have lived for the last millennia. If you are in Marrakesh, well worth going to for the museum alone."

You walk into an oasis of striking bamboo that makes the walk serene and tranquil. There were many different plant species and an abundance of cactus. Plants are well labeled and the meandering path over bridges and past ponds is very relaxing. The bright blue ceramics and tiles make the garden seem like a piece of design work. There is a lovely monument dedicated to Yves Saint Laurent and a room highlighting the artwork he used over the years for his holiday cards. Not a large place but definitely worth the visit if you enjoy natural beauty."

We were a group of four and I think we all thoroughly enjoyed these gardens..... so green, so lush, so exotic and so beautifully maintained (as all the public garden spaces in Marrakech seemed to be). Plant pots and buidlings are painted in vibrant blues and yellows which contrast wonderfully with the lush planting and the stillness of the beautiful calm water 'feature' (sorry, that word just does not do the long narrow pool justice). The museum was interesting and the Love Gallery delightful. The gift shop had some beautiful items but a little too pricey for us, also the book shop. There is a delightful little cafe with a courtyard garden - the food once again was pricey - we just had a coffee which was excellent. Disappointing was the memorial to Yves Saint-Laurant which was entirely dull and uninspiring. Also, I had not realised that the house that YSL had lived in was private and not open to the public. The street leading up to the gardens also has some charming little shops and it is easy to grab a caleche there for the ride back to town."

Even at this time of year it was busy so I imagine there would be queues forming in the summer months. I guess the best time of day to visit would be early in the morning.

The gardens were beautiful and the trees and plants provided an adequate amount of shade from the hot Moroccan sun. The museum was another 30 MDH inside the garden, and it was a great insight into the historical progression of another culture. I especially enjoyed the tribute to YSL and the few of his art pieces displayed within the gardens a few steps away from his monument. Definitely a relaxing way to start a busy day in Marrakech!"

Don't go expecting manicured lawns, panoramic vistas, lakes, grottoes or statuary - this is more like a walk through through the palm house of a botanic garden! The paths meander around pools with water lilies in full bloom, bamboo plantations rustling in the breeze, cacti sweltering in the summer sun and palm trees of all different shapes and sizes. Not to mention many other plants combining together to give wonderful aspects just crying out for pictures to be painted or photos to be taken!The colours are amazing; from the cobalt blue and brilliant yellows of the planters to the pink and purple of bougainvillea not forgetting the flash of gold from the goldfish in the ponds.It's a lovely spot to while away an hour or two in the heat of the day with plenty of seating provided and a cafe to refresh yourself, if you can afford the prices!Mornings in the gardens seem to be pretty busy with large groups of tourists being shown around but by noon, it had quietened down.By the way, the main entrance gates are locked; if you are standing looking at these gates, you need to continue down the main road to the right and the small entrance for the public is down a side street, usually choked with caleches, taxis and coaches!"

Enclosed by huge trees separating the fumes and noises of Moroccan life you forget where you are. You can even take a nap on one of the many benches. There's plenty of shade if you're thinking of bringing small children here, and a cafe to rest your legs with a refreshment, but not really for a backpacker budget. Learning the history behind the park also adds to your visit, you get a small flyer with your ticket explaining the background. There is a fantastic array of over 300 different species of plant, including a great cacti garden. The park is full of contrasting colours, making the green from the trees look really lovely. When we went it was relatively quiet, people were respecting each other; reading, napping, drawing etc which was lovely. There is a very small room in one corner filled with posters of Yves Saint Laurent's 'Love' collage artwork he made every New Years. You can buy postcards of these from the shop opposite which is a cheap way to remember your visit and take away something colourful.The only thing I would advise is taking a large bottle of water as you can only buy small un-refridgerated bottles inside the park for a steep price. Packing a small lunch might be a good idea too as lunch at the restaurant is a little overpriced. Overall, it's a lovely place in the city to waste away a few hours if you like, or just visit for half an hour. I got the impression I could've stayed all day. There is NO need to get a horse and cart if you arrive by taxi and it drops you a street away - it's only down the road!"

Yves has a phallic pink memorial in the Gardens. Although Morocco is a relatively liberal Islamic country, it's still slightly odd to wander the former home of such an overtly gay celebrity. In the souks a shopkeeper was trying to sell me a pouf - \"it is a pouf not a poof - we don't like those here either\". Yves Sant-Laurent loved the city, though, and there's a definite ambivalence to homosexuality in Marrakech. You only have to wander the Djemaa el Fna and witness the cross-dressing men dancing seductively and clashing their zils with a rhythmic passion to see that. This behaviour is not just tolerated, but watched with great interest and cheered on by the mostly male crowds that gather around.Yves didn't build the gardens, he bought them. They were originally laid out by French artist Jacques Majorelle when Morocco was still a colony of France. The gardens are marked by their extensive use of a strong cobalt blue paint, this colour became known as Majorelle Blue. It's a beautiful and tranquil oasis and a great place to escape to when the crowds of Marrakech start to overwhelm you !!"

            "review": "Don't waste your time and money. As an experienced traveler who tries to stay out of tourist traps, all I can say is: what a hustle. First, to get there, you will have a very difficult time finding a cab willing to take you for metered fare. They all demand at least 50 Dirham (fair price on the meter is about 17) and say this is the standard \"special\" price for Majorelle gardens. I had to start walking towards nearby police officer before the coalition of petit taxi drivers standing there would finally relent and give me a fair price on the meter. Once you get there, you find out that admission is 50 Dirham per person. For Moroccan prices, this price implies to me that you're about to see something really incredible. Okay, so you buy the ticket and walk in. Oh boy!! What's in there?! You see a small garden, packed to the gills with tour groups who have been dumped by the busload. It's far too packed to stroll properly, and no one quite knows what to do there, so many people are taking banal selfies and cactus macros with their phones to the extent that you can't enjoy what little that this garden has to offer. Fifteen minutes later, after two circles around the pathways, we began anew the exciting journey of finding a metered cab back to the city center. Only this time, the hustle is systematic! There's a man standing out front with a clipboard who will arrange for you to get into a cab for 50 Dirham. Ignore him, and walk a few blocks away from the tourist area and flag down a cab that isn't circling. Either get him on the meter, or offer him 20 Dirham to Marrakesh center (this worked for us). When we got into the cab, the first question we were asked: \"so, second time in Morocco, huh?\" No, first time actually; tourist hustling operates about the same the world-over.In summary, I found this garden to be highly emblematic of Yves Saint Laurent and the fashion industry that he embodied: overrated and overpriced."

He went and got our tickets handed us our change and lingered. I think he wanted a tip, but we didnt give him anything. The gardens are beautiful. Plenty of photo opportunities, although modern tourism has brought people to carve into the bamboo which was sad to see, rather like la casa di giulietta in verona. We enjoyed lunch in the cafe which was expensive but not too bad. Taxi drivers leap on you as you exit. Ignore their pleas of \"it costs 10dh to park\" and state your lowest price and walk away. You will find he grabs his keys and grumbles the same price. They would rather make a little than nothing at all! Xx"

There are lots of benches dotted around to sit and drink in the lovely peaceful atmosphere and just gaze at the gardens or people watch! It's possible to walk here from the main square in the Medina, it takes approximately 15 minutes, there really is no need for a taxi although crossing the roads is pretty scary!It's worth buying the double ticket for the gardens and the Berber Museum as both are worthy of your time. I wouldn't recommend visiting with children, there is nothing to amuse them.The on site restaurant is lovely, it's not terribly expensive although there are much cheaper eateries in the medina. The food is pretty good quality and the fruit drinks are to die for. Staff were very accomodating."

Fortunately I was wrong. It is a charming testament to the vision of its founder, and to that of Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge, who restored it and made it a public garden. The small Berber Museum within the garden is a stunning collection of Berber textiles and objects, beautifully displayed and curated, with multilingual signage. The major disappointment with the garden is that it gets very crowded. Best to arrive very early or very late in the day. It is difficult to enjoy such a contemplative space when surrounded by noisy crowds. It can be seen in a short time, or one can linger here for hours, especially if visiting the Berber Museum."

Lots of different sections to the garden; with ponds (complete with tortoises) a memorial to Yves Saint Laurent, a lovely shop and a bookshop all inside the walls. Beautiful architecture and real attention to detail from the hard working gardeners.There is also a slightly overpriced restaurant.

A great place to sit a while on a hot day, it's like an oasis in the city. But the crown jewel of the property is the Berber Museum! The collection includes jewelry, everyday implements and traditional dress and textiles of the Berber peoples.; a truly remarkable cultural collection. As an aside, I was very disappointed in the gift shop."

We had a free Sunday morning prior to returning home, so into a taxi, and back we went.There were no large tour groups that day:very quiet. We started with coffee in the lovely courtyard cafe (had the place to ourselves) and then spent several hours wandering, sitting and looking., A horticulturist and photographer's paradise, and despite being relatively small, there was so much to see. The birds sang throughout and it was a fantastic experience. Returning to the cafe for lunch, we had fresh, tasty and inexpensive food beneath the orange trees. Magical. The admission cost to the gardens is 50 dirhams, around 5 euro, and the the Berber Museum was an extra 250 dirhams: great value for an impressive and beautifully displayed exhibition. The jewellery room was the most stunning museum display I've ever seen (and I've been to many!) with clever hidden mirrors giving a infinitepanorama of stars and the artegacts glowing in the clever lighting: just superb. You won't have time for this unless you visit independently: even the taxi driver suggested waiting for us, since he said we would need just 30 mins. If you like gardens, and want to relax in a stunning, cool environment away from the city bustle, allow at least a good couple of hours. So beautiful: wished my partner had been with me as it's a romantic spot! Will definitely go back again some day."

With the literally hundreds of tourists likely to be there at any given time, it is hardly the peaceful place it was designed to be.

We were very impressed by the design of the gardens as we were unaware of its history\u2014we later learned that it was laid out by the artist Jaques Majorelle in the 1930\u2019s and bought by Yves St. Laurent and his partner Pierre Berg\u00e9 in 1980, who continued to improve it until St. Laurent\u2019s death in 2008. When our time was up we felt we hadn\u2019t seen all we wanted to see, and did not take time to visit the museum, so we resolved to pay another visit before we left town. We did a few days later, did the longer circuit of the garden itself, and spent about an hour (time well spent!) in the beautifully conceived and executed museum of Berber culture. On our next trip to Marrakech we will definitely devote a few hours for the peace, quiet, and beauty of the garden."

There are also many benches provided for you to sit and enjoy the lush surroundings. There are also water features and a lily pond pool and much of the garden is painted in a brilliant blue colour. We also really enjoyed the gallery of love - YSL would create a love card and send them to his friends on New Year Day each year and they display them in a small gallery at the back of the garden. I wished they had sold prints of them in the gift shop!

So many beautiful cactus plants, trees, flowers, gardens literally made into pieces of art, dark azure blue skies as a backdrop and even though it was quite busy, there was still a hint of peace and quiet. Certainly worth visiting and if we happen to be in Marrakesh again, most definitely would return for another look."

I was not particularly impressed with this Garden, seeing that you can get to Holland park for free, and it is extensively bigger (no comparison, this one is VERY tiny), with more landscaping going than in this garden, I did not feel that the 50MAD was truly justified, but as for something you can do around Marrakesh I guess it is another tick in the book, made popular by the lack of other things to see unless you travel further. If you can time go and see it, but if not, you are not losing much."

Take a taxi as it is slightly too far to walk but make sure you negotiate the price and have plenty of change. They might say 80 and you only have a 100 note so you are really being overcharged. The smaller taxis which only take 3 people are cheaper than getting a big Merc if there are 3 or less of you."

It does not take too long to walk around the garden paths, and there are many benches on which to relax and grab some shade.

It contains plants and flowers from all over the World, with fantastic colours and beautiful foliage from all angles (see pictures). The garden is small and will take around 45 minutes to traverse. A great place for photos.The garden also houses Yves Saint Laurent's Love gallery, with pictures he created every year from the opening of the garden to his death. Some of these are beautiful (see pictures) and I wish prints had been available.The garden also has a shop. It sells boutique clothing and jewelry, which are sold at European prices (and not branded Yves Saint Laurent designs). They are obviously high quality though and so of the designs are fabulous.The museum hosts varying fashion/art exhibitions. I didn't find the Berber Women exhibition particularly inspiring and would only buy a ticket if the exhibition particularly caught my eye."

The gardens were absolutely lovely and amazing. A bamboo and palm forrest, accented with an appreciable collection of cactus, bougainvillea, and water features. The designer obviously knew what he was doing, because the proportions and colors are not the sort of thing an amateur could figure out in a way that still works 85 years later. We bought the extra ticket for the Berber museum on the grounds. Again, I wasn't exactly looking forward to it, but was pleasantly surprised. I learned a great deal about Berber history and culture, and the displays of jewelry, tools and clothing were beautifully done. I highly recommend both attractions.

We spent a very pleasant hour and half here - the one thing that did mar our visit was the sight of quite a few dead goldfish floating on the surface of the lily ponds ! However there were plenty of live ones to compensate. We paid to go around the Berber museum which was interesting and very importantly had English translations for each of the rooms and exhibits - not the case with other Museums we visited.The cafe proved to be really busy with a queue already formed by the time we got there so we just made our way back to our Riad by horse and cart which was quite an experience in itself weaving in and out of the busy traffic!

Nothing wrong with it, but it's not very big, and you just follow a path around a garden of plants which in a lot of cases have sadly been graffiti'd and defaced. I'm guessing a large garden is a bit more impressive if you live in a desert country. If you come from a green country in the first place, this won't be very impressive!"

The cacti are impressive in their variety and planting design. I liked the fountain and some of the pathways painted in vivid blue.I did not find the garden relaxing as it had few \"quiet corners\", tourists were fed through the various pathways, the cafe was nice although very busy- possibly my expectations were too high but overall while a pleasant this visit it left me definitely underwhelmed."

The Berber museum had a variety of displays of Berber dress, lifestyle, jewellery, weaponry and all in English and French guides.

We chose to walk to the location and our guide book/map did not assist us too much in finding it and we eventually arrived hot and ready to rest. We were not disappointed once inside.If you expect to keep walking and be entertained then don't go here! If you want to sit and admire the numerous views and relax in the tranquil location then this is a great place to do it. It is not a huge place, but we found that 2 hours drifted away and we were left uplifted by the experience.Stunning photo opportunities in every direction you look.Entry price was a bit steep, but worth it."

But in a city as hectic and tiring as Marrakech this is a great place to come and unwind.The selection of cacti is certainly extensive, if you love green spiky plants then you won't be let down. As someone who enjoys photography I enjoyed the opportunities that the various plants and the colours afforded me.The museum was interesting as well. The impression I get is that the exhibits vary, I was lucky enough to find a display on the history of Berber culture, a people I knew little about. The ticketing system was slightly confusing though - the signage outside the gardens suggested a combined garden-and-museum ticket could be bought at the main entrance. Upon getting to the ticket desk, we were told that we had to buy museum tickets inside the gardens, at the entrance to the museum. It turned out that we could, but almost every other customer had a combined ticket that they had bought from the main entrance.But the highlight by far was the turtles: a mother and 3 children. They live in the main pond with the fish, and even as a big, 6ft, toughened Scotsman I found them pretty adorable.So yeah, worth stopping by for a few hours to de-stress."

There was a short queue at the entrance but it only took a few minutes before we entered the gardens.It is certainly very peaceful and the shade makes the area quite cool compared to the open areas surrounding the gardens. It's probably a combination of the lack of city noise, hustle and bustle and the heat but it is really peaceful in here with the water features helping with the cool feeling. Unfortunately you have the usual idiots who have carve their names in the beautiful large bamboo stems, defacing them in the process and taking something away from the pristine feeling of the gardens.Even a relatively quick walk around would take about an hour but you could easily spend a couple of hours here.

The garden, established by Jacques Majorelle and further developed by Yves Saint Laurent is quite different from any other I have seen. It is small enough to get round, and include lunch or a snack in the lovely cafe in a couple of hours. The cactus planting was particularly impressive, and bougainvillea provided splashes of colour, as did the vividly painted building and plant pots, including the striking, iconic, Majorelle blue. The pools with water lilies, goldfish, and a fountain were restful features. However short your visit to Marrakech, this is well worth including in your programme."

It was disappointing that we weren't told at the entrance that they would advise at least 2h to benefit from the beauty of the garden as opposed to cashing another 2 entry tickets\u2026.Many of the plants were engraved with messages / names by indelicate visitors. The garden was a bit dry, I didn't feel it was well maintained (time of the year maybe)? I'd recommend a few hours to spend there, especially for photographers as there are many close up shots to take, but beware of the opening times. I wish the Garden owners did pay more attention to keeping their plants free from people's own silly tags. Very quiet place."

The prevalent blue colour is such a contrast to the plants and flowers but it is magical. We enjoyed a 45 minute stroll around admiring the different varieties of plants from tall bamboos, to wacky cacti and colourful bourgainvilla. There were a few water features which added to the ambience. It is not far from the centre of Marrakesh (150 dhms from the Medina by taxi and the driver will wait for you for about 30-40 minutes).

No Arabic here; just English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Dutch. It's a place where European tourists could escape from Marrakech, whilst in Marrakech. That's essentially what Jacques Majorelle was doing there as well, a tourist building a fantasy of an exotic Northern African gardenscape. For the same price as the admission price, you can have a nice meal out for two, and the entry fee is five times more than that of historical places that are hundreds of years old, like Bahia Palace or the gorgeous Dar Si Said. The cost of entry per person is about 10% of the average monthly salary in Morocco--which I would imagine would make this a very cost prohibitive place to go for most residents. The garden is essentially a European post-colonial intervention in the middle of Marrakech. It's a lovely place to linger for an afternoon, but it should be recognised it for what it is."

We arrived at midday, the garden was very busy with coach parties of tourists, so heed other posters advice and arrive early if you can! The greenery is punctuated with the bright colours of the pots, lots of Marjorell blue, yellows and oranges. The walls of the buildings are also painted in the same palette of strong colours. There are ponds filled with fish and turtles.The Berber museum is worth the extra charge and is well set out inside, again this was busy and we spent some time in the cafe waiting for the crowds to thin out before going in. I think you need to have an interest in plants/gardening to get the most out of this place.There is also a shop there which sells a range of items (jewellery, textiles, etc) but these were expensive."

The gardens are small and full of either people blocking your way while they all get photos of the endless cacti (engraved with people's names! - how trashy of them) and palm trees. It is not calm at all and is also full of men crying on each others shoulders, presumably over the death of a man they've never met - get over yourselves! It was crowded (we were there out of season) and so highly over-rated. We paid another 40 dirhams to escape this dirty neighbourhood and went to the Hotel La Mamounia where we paid 60 dirhams for a lovely Moroccan mint tea on their beautiful terrace. We walked around their gardens (free of charge) and they were far superior to the rubbish at YSL's. Lovely friendly staff. Two totally different experiences. Let's see -130 dirhams to go and see a dump and no refreshments, or 60 dirhams for a drink in beautiful calm surrounding and gardens to wander at your leisure - what would you choose?"

Me and my family all love gardens, cacti and plants so this was a perfect way to spend a day. Reasonable entrance fee, 50Dh, yes it is a small garden but we spent 3 hours there, this did include lunch in the cafe, and we still could have wandered around again! Full of stunning mature cacti and succulents, a long with impressive cascade of vines and bougainvilleas, I can't recommend a visit here enough. The cafe was nice, limited selection and not the cheapest place to eat in the city but still enjoyable. The museum was also good, very informative and a good added extra. The whole garden was well maintained and in good condition, but why people feel the need to graffiti the agave plant I don't know! It was a shame to see such mindless vandalism to plants of all things."

The garden is named after a French painter, Jacques Majorelle, who lived in Marrakesh, acquired this plot of land in 1924 and opened the garden to the public in 1947. After his death It was taken over by Yves Saint Laurent, the famous French designer, and has been restored to absolute splendor by him. Not only the plants are interesting, in particular a fantastic collection of cactus, but also the choice of colors on the flower pots, pathways etc. There is a memorial for Yves Saint Laurent in the garden so that you do not forget his part in creating this small paradise.If you want to, you can also visit a Berber Museum in the park.Most visitors, however, will flock either to the caf\u00e9 or to the Yves Saint Laurent shop where for out of this world prices you can acquire absolute top quality goods beautifully displayed. Beware to go in there !"

We walked from the medina and it took around 40mins to get there. It was 50dhrms (5euro) each. The park is small, but very very well kept, quiet and a nice place to spend a few hours. I would recommend paying a little extra to include the museum admission, it a museum about the berber people, interesting stuff."

It is worthwhile paying extra to visit the Museum with its beautifully displayed Berber artifacts. There is a delightful reasonably priced courtyard restaurant, and by using its toilets you avoid the queues at the public toilets elsewhere in the garden. There is an official outside the gardens who organises the taxis. Beware, they charge more than twice the going rate, so walk down the short distance into the main road where you can flag down a cab at normal prices."

We pottered for a while then went to the caf\u00e9 for a very pleasant dessert and drink. And it was so nice to find a toilet where I didn't have to argue with someone to get in!After our snack we strolled around again and you could tell how popular it is by the numbers of people there. It was nice to have a quick look in the gallery and souvenir shops, although they were pricey! There is a large shop outside near the garden entrance which is fascinating and was worth a look.It is slightly higher priced than the majority of tourist attractions in Marrakech but if you need to get away from Moroccan bustle (and they really know how to bustle!) then I do recommend this place."

The area around the garden is clearly well to do and there is a lovely coffee shop almost opposite the entrance. The gardens themselves were rescued by Yves St Laurent who has a small shrine there to his memory. \"Majorelle Blue\" was invented to paint the buildings and post with and is wonderful. The gardens themselves contain many plants that survive in hot climes, including the most amazing collection of cactii. The main building houses a fabulous museum of Berber history and is a must see. Admission is covered by the entrance price. There is an excellent cafe too and if you time it right then a good look round, with lunch, could take a couple of hours out of your day. However it is a major stop for tourist coaches so if you want to be alone arrive early or late - at midday it will be heaving and you will inevitably appear in alot of other people's photographs!"

It seemed like any other ordinary palm tree garden. If you were to venture over to the left, you could see through a large gate into what was basically a building site. After venturing past the rather dull Yves Saint-Laurent monument, we were finally greeted by something interesting. A beautiful pond and a lovely over-vegetated bridge that then led us to the vibrant cactus farm that sat next to a large bright blue building. This was more like it! However, to our disappointment, that was it. There was nothing else to these famed gardens. So be warned, if you're expecting a grandiose walk then you might as well go somewhere else. However, for a quick short walk around a rather pleasant environment, go for it."

As with so many of the city's delights, this mini-paradise is just off a dusty road, making entry into its cool confines all the more wonderful.The aura of the great Yves San Laurent, who lived nearby, is palpable; but the Berbers win out in the end.

The simplicity of the exotic planting, the tranquil ponds, the organic bamboo fences and the vibrant but limited colours used for the pots, building, etc. make this garden a peaceful oasis in busy Marrakesh. At the same time its impact on the senses is huge. The garden is immaculately kept. There is a Berber Museum and a small gallery containing Yves Saint Laurent's original Love paintings used for his New Year cards. If you visit Marrakesh this place is a must."

I think the real point of interest in this is the Berber (?) museum, which displayed great objects of Berber everyday-life and ceremonies. You can see a wide range of marriage and special events clothing and jewelry, and a lot of interesting, typical objects. It also explains a lot about the origins of this community, its religions, beliefs, uses... It really worths it.

There is also a suggestion that the only reason Majorelle has over 6000 reviews, is because of its affiliation with YSL. But the site does give a completely different complex on Marrakech, especially with its multi colours away from the pink city...the plants on show are very eye catching and you can surprisingly carve your name on selected cacti on show! The cafe and souvenir shop are most definitely at YSL prices. The strong points of the gardens are tranquility, peace, relaxation and colourful.

Prices in the shop require an insurmountable level of Zen like thinking however... 4800 dirham FOR A TABLECLOTH. That's \u00a3380. Best not to touch anything.I didn't eat at the cafe as I was already booked in elsewhere, but the menu looked nice, but not cheap. Wouldn't require sale of first born though, unlike the tablecloth. All the information as to price and location in the 2013 Lonely Planet Morocco guide complete codswallop. Annoyingly so. The entrance is NOT \"corner of Avenue Yacoub el Mansour and Moulay Abdellah\" - that would be a Shell petrol station. In fact it is 0.3 km away back along Yacoub towards the Medina. When you get to the caleche stand, turn left past the row of restaurants and nice clothes shops and the entrance is 50m on the left. Cost is also 50 Dh for teh garden and 25 for the museum."

The most surprising thing about this Garden is its right on one of the main roads though has a large 10ft wall around it. The entrance cost was high in comparison to other attractions in the city 50dhs per person. Once inside it was basically an oval path with two centre paths which even at a slow amble took no more than 20 minutes to get round and apart from a lot of bamboo which was quite impressive after the first couple of metres but got a bit repetitious after that there was not a great variety of plants and nothing that had any wow or unexpected factor. The place though is a little oasis of calm from the madness which is Marrakesh \u2013 as said it\u2019s right on a main road but once inside the walls all that is blocked out. It\u2019s one to see and tick it off the list but if you are only in the city for a short stop do not waste your time with this one go to the main square and the souks every time there are hundreds of things you can see out there that are unique to Marrakesh any posh garden centre in the UK would give these gardens a run for their money."

The other attraction is the tranquility that awaits you after all the hustle and bustle! The Cafe was expensive, but you will find 2 outside more reasonably priced."

This is a small garden & if your idea is to sit on the grass & contemplate lush greenery, then this is not the place for you.This little oasis is more for a quick stroll and some photo ops.They do, however, have a great little shop with items designed with the influence of Yves St Laurent & I highly recommend paying the extra fee to go see the Berber museum which I foundvery interesting & informative. Kudos to YSL for amassing & preserving all this items that showcase Berber artistry at it's best! This museum only makes the trip out to Majorelle worth it.Also suggest that you take the time to peruse the shops right outside the garden entrance. They have wonderful shops there that offer unique & edgily designed items that you won't find elsewhere. Totally loved the shopping there. Well worth the time to do all three - the garden, museum & shopping!"

There is a cafe - we didn't try it but it looked like a nice seating area, again very shady and prices looked good. Overall a pleasant way to while away an hour on our last day.

I'll be quite honest here, I honestly don't know anything or care in the slightest about Yves Saint Laurent and his connection with the City and Country, I was going for the calm and tranquility.I think it's 50 dirham for the gardens and 25 for the Berber museum, or vice versa, either way it 75 dirham entrance fee, which is a fair and decent price. The gardens are ( and I know this phrase has been used to death ) a real oasis of calm. From the abundance and selection of cacti to the beautiful flowers, palm trees and other tropical plants of which I have no idea what they were, you can very easily just spend an hour walking around the gardens, totally chilled and relaxed. The Berber museum, for me personally, was ok. Don't get me wrong, as museums go, it was spotless, highly informative, educational and filled to the rafters with \"stuff from the past\".......that last statement probably telling you that history really isn't my thing. But in the World of credit where credit is due, it was a fantastic and well spent hour looking around and taking in all the history of the Berber people, the tools they used, weapons they fought with, clothes they wore etc. In short, I loved the gardens, and although the museum wasn't for me as such, I still found it highly impressive and enjoyed my time there. Oh, I almost forgot the wonderful cafe hidden away in the middle of the gardens, you really need to stop for a cafe au lait or mint tea here."

The plants and trees are beautifully arranged and all labelled so that you know what they are; the cactus garden is particularly impressive. There is a very interesting and well-presented Berber museum, from which I learnt a lot. But what makes this place unforgettable is the wonderful colours - the 'Majorelle blue', bright yellow and greens - of the buildings and garden features. Marrakech has many fine things to see, but these gardens were our favourite."

The garden itself is not very big but, despite being packed with tourists, it is a real haven to have a rest and recharge batteries before going back to the chaos outside its walls. The fountains and ponds surrounded by many different plants from around the world for the joy of those interested in botany, and the buildings and plant pots painted in vibrant colours make a strange but somehow harmonious mix."

Although relatively expensive to get in compared to the entrance fee to other attractions, the gardens are beautiful and an oasis of calm and tranquillity in the heat. The colours are amazing and there are information boards around the gardens detailing the different plant species and their origins.Watch out for the taxi drivers outside though. The gardens are not in close proximity to the city centre and make sure you are happy with the price and are clear on what you have agreed before getting in. We paid 30 MAD to get there from the Medina but found that drivers were demanding more than twice this to get back!"

Unlike other gardens in Marrakesh, Majorelle is much more sculpted and landscaped and it shows with the number of people there. Great for photographs, but you will have to accept crowds of people in every frame. personally I preferred the museum to the gardens.

It fell into disrepair after his death but was then rescued by Yves Saint Laurent who brought it back to its former glory. There is an almost reverent hush as you enter the gardens from the bustling street despite significant numbers of visitors. This gives a very peaceful and tranquil feel to the gardens which are easy to walk around. The plants and pathways are well maintained and the memorial to YSL is simple and elegant. What truly stood out for me, though, were the colours. Majorelle blue is a stunning, vibrant blue that can be seen everywhere from the house to the ponds and plant pots and are interspersed with pots of equally vibrant oranges and yellows.Even if gardens are not your thing then a visit is well worth while to see the fantastic Berber museum created by Majorelle. Certainly the finest display of artefacts in Marrakech depicting the life and customs of the Berber people who live in the surrounding Atlas mountains.The book shop after the museum is expensive as is the gift shop although the souvenirs are not your average tat."

We found this to be worth every single penny we paid to get in.As soon as you enter you come to a little courtyard type area with a fountain and it is just then you realise you can no longer hear the traffic or noise from outside, just the sound of the birds singing in the trees.Very well laid out and immaculately tended gardens which instill a nice sense of calm and tranquillity as you walk around, the trees obviously provide some very welcome relief from the sun and I can imagine in high summer they would be be a huge boon to visitors.Plenty of flowers still in bloom which was nice as it added a splash of colour every now and then to the greenery and they perfumed the air with a nice light scent. I'd love to see the riot of colour that must happen in spring and summer though.Usual goldfish in the ponds but plenty of terrapins too.The museum is full of Berber artefacts and we found this to be very interesting, it was about a 15-20minute wait to get in and I think we were in there for about 30 minutes. The museum is extra on the garden entry fee and I'd say it is worth paying. The museum is also right by the cafe in the gardens.By the time we had a spot of lunch and a final wander we realised we had been in the gardens for over 3.5hrs! yet it didn't seem that long at all whilst walking.There is a gift shop on site but the pricing is verging on high to ridiculous in there.This is very well worth a few hours of your valuable holiday time and we'd highly recommend it."

That said, the gardens are very pretty, even if you don't necessarily know what kind of plant you are looking at at a particular time. Also, the gardens are smaller than you would expect, and you can get through them quickly without trying to.Lovely gift shop, and not nearly as expensive as comparable gift shops at major stateside attractions.

A stunning combination of water features, cool bamboo-lined pathways, tropical plants and an incredible cactus collection provide a welcome break after the intense experience of th medina. The beautiful blue used throughout the garden shows the artists eye of Jacques Majorelle and the legacy was continued and developed by St Laurent and Berge. The cafe provides a reasonable meal but is worth it for the ambiance. Included is an excellent bookshop and the shop which goes way beyond the obligatory souvenirs to provide YSL love themed items among other high quality stock. The shops across the road from the main gate are also worth a visit for higher quality shopping."

It's a big disappoimntment in that, quite simply, there is nothing much to see except a wide variety of cacti from around the world and some very tall bamboo trees. And a rather self-obsessed little museum in the grounds. It certainly does not merit the entrance charge. This for us was a waste of a trip. 15 minutes was quite enough time to devote to it assuming you also had an expensive cup of tea in the cafe. It does not deserve to be on the same roster as other magnificent buildings and gardens elsewhere in the city"

The toilet facilities are kept very clean hence you pay a small fee to use them.Taxis and carriages wait outside the park exit so going on somewhere afterwards is easy although we flagged down a taxi on the main road as there is no commission that way.I think it cost 30 Dirham per adult to visit the gardens.

Amazing to see so much of their culture gathered under one roof - a real legacy. The jewellery collection certainly allows you to see the inspiration that Yves Saint Laurent then took to the world in the design of his own jewellery and the bottles for his perfumes.The gardens are really refreshing to visit on a hot day (it was 45 degrees the day we went) and appear as an \"oasis\" within downtown Marrakesh where you do not see a lot of parks and gardens.Taking a horse drawn carriage there helps you wind down and arrive at the garden in a relaxed mode. Even if you are not into gardens do make time to visit here while you are in Marrakesh."

NoIs it a welcome break from the city? YesWould you be missing an amazing experience? No, but the museum is worth a look as it's very different to the others.It took an hour to walk very slowly around the garden and the museum, taking lots of photos and reading everything (ie: it's not big).

We had to walk past the central bus station to get to the gardens, so after the smell and noise, piles of rubbish and chaotic traffic, it really did seem like a small piece of heaven. Although there were quite a lot of other people in the gardens, this in no way detracted from our enjoyment of the beautiful colours, amazing cacti and other plants and the quiet area around the memorial to Yves St Laurent. The gardens are beautifully kept and definitely should be on everyones visit list. The Berber museum inside the gardens is very well presented with some spectacular displays of costume and jewellery, worth the small extra payment to visit."

Marrakech is so full of bustle, sound and smell, and yet the Jardin Majorelle was a total contrast to all the mayhem. Luckily my partner had taken heed of the warnings to go early and we arrived at 09:30am, it was quiet enough that I could take photos unhindered by other visitors and view what I wanted to. By the time we left, the queues had started to form at the entrance and the coach parties were turning up, so please do go early if you want to enjoy the garden at its best. The myriad of plant types and colours really are a joy and provide a nice shade from the sun, there are plenty of places to sit and quietly take in the experience. It may not be the largest garden in the world, but I certainly believe the small entrance fee worth every Dirham. The garden is well tended and the facilities \u2013 tea room, toilets etc clean and inviting. Again, going early meant that we could slowly peruse the gardens yet still be the only ones in the tea room at the end of our visit. I would heartily recommend a visit to the Jardin Majorelle, it\u2019s only a couple of hours out of your day and more than worth the jaunt away from the Medina."

The colours were interesting and vibrant, the \"Yves Saint Laurent blue\" against yellow, but next to a cactus garden it all seemed to Mexican. Also the house in these gardens were not that of the great man but his guest house. ( Winston Churchill stayed here according to our guide) and there is no access.The great man's memorial was here (boring) and his house was on the other side of the fence which nobody can see nor enter. I would have thought his house would be a great museum piece and many whom come to this garden think they are going to see something of Yves Saint Laurent's life, but alas it is not to be. Some of my neighbours gardens are more impressive."

Although expensive, the garden is definitely worth going to and taking your time, sitting on the numerous benches and relaxing. There is a small monument to remember Yves Saint Laurent, one of the last owners of the gardents. It's a bit odd looking.There are two ticket options, either including or excluding a visit to the house. We opted for only seeing the gardens and still had a very pleasant time. The garden can get very busy at times, especially if travelling groups are visiting. Yet, the stream of visitors seems to vary throughout the day, thus, taking it slow will help to enjoy the garden in lovely peace and quiet eventually.We did not visit the Cafe in the garden but the menu options sounded delicious.

The guidebook we had said you cannot buy water inside, so we bought it from a vendor outside for something like 10 dirhams for small bottle...just inside the gate though they were selling for 5 :) It's relatively 'expensive' compared to other sites in Marrakech, 50 dirhams while palaces and museums are usually 10. If you want to take a taxi back, do not get them from near the gate! They are sooooo pricey. Instead, walk down to the main street and hail one a few meters away. Same goes for the horses- negotiate and try to find one a bit away from the gate. We got a carriage back to the main square for 30 dirhams for 2 people. They try to tell you a price, then later say it's for only one person- make sure you say TOTAL PRICE :)"

In June, the flowering trees towered over the shady walkways, and for a nominal fee you get to experience what it must be like to be super rich and own your own designer line. There is one particular area full of cacti that was breathtaking (not just because its so hot). Don't be surprised, the gardens are not that big, but what it doesn't have in size makes up for in beauty. Take one of the horse-drawn carriages from here but make sure the driver doesn't swindle you out of your money. I think we paid 400 dirhams to be nice, but I think 200 is more reasonable. They will intentionally drive you to a \"drug store\" apothecary to sell you argan oil...and since they were so nice (swindle) we bought some."

There's a pleasant enough cafe where prices are many times what you pay on the street.For me, the best part of the visit was the museum of Berber culture. This seems to be not much more than a footnote on the publicity for the Jardin Majorelle but outshone the garden entirely. It's a beautifully presented and extensive collection of Berber costume and jewellery. 5 stars for this!NB. The garden and museum are run by the Pierre Berg\u00e9 \u2013 Yves Saint Laurent Foundation. I loved the bit in the leaflet we were handed where it said that Berg\u00e9 and YSL had established the foundation \"to celebrate and preserve the genius of Yves St Laurent\".

The park wardens are very lovely and were happy to take photos of us and chat.There is a small room of posters designed by Yves Saint Laurent in the gardens during his ownership of them- if you're a fan of fashion it is great to visit as his ashes were scattered there.The real highlight of the trip though was the little gallery in the gardens. It housed artwork, tools, costume, jewellery and so on from the Berber tribe of North Africa. Which was all very interesting when explained by the BEST GALLERY GUIDE OF ALL TIME. He was very witty and spoke 5 languages, filling us in on the background to the objects and also just providing genuinely lovely conversation. I wish I could remember his name. BUT everyone should visit for him alone!"

The area is well maintained and has many different kinds of plants, although most weren't flowering. Not sure if this was due to the time of year or the type of plant. Still pretty to look at, although we were expecting more color. The majority of color contrast comes from the painted planters and building walls. The cafe has a very inviting patio area, where you can sit and relax while enjoying your order (coconut sorbet - fantastic!)"

The plants and cacti come in many different colors, shapes and sizes, which was really cool. The house in the garden was also a very beautiful shade of blue and with a mixture of other colors, again very pretty for pictures.The gardens itself are not very big. You can be done in well under an hour if you don't stop much to take pictures."

This is actually a fairly small place where you walk around set paths looking at plants from across the world.Still really nice and there are some benches to sit on but personally not somewhere I could relax and spend a couple of hours chilling away from the hustle of Marrakesh.It also does get very busy and being set paths you can end up a fair number of people in front or behind as well as queues at the 'idyllic photo' locations. A tip would be to try and visit early in the day.The charge to get in is moderate and it is a taxi ride from the main square although we did actually walk back ourselves."

We walked from our Riad in the Medina to the gardens which took us a very leisurely 40 minutes through the market and past the bus station. There were lots of taxis and coaches dropping people off at the entrance, but it is easy to find walking there if you have good instructions. There is an small entrance fee to the garden and another fee to the Museum. There is a cafe where you can get a drink and a snack, meal and refreshments (no alcohol). We did not go, so cannot comment on the restaurant. The gardens are lovely, people taking advantage of the many seating areas, but we did not linger as we had a lunch reservation elsewhere. Nice way to spend a leisurely couple of hours"

We walked to the gardens as our Ryad was only 10/15 minutes away so it was surreal going from the hectic roads into the beautiful quiet oasis that is the Majorelle Gardens. The gardens themselves are relatively small but they are beautifully laid out and looked after. The paths allow you to walk rounds as many times as you like and there are benches along the routes so you can sit and relax. The towering bamboos provided great shade so its lovely and cool, especially as it was 39C on the day we went! We chose not to pay the extra for the museum but had a lovely mint tea in the caf\u00e9 there instead. It wasn't the cheapest but the location was beautiful and the mint tea delicious, it also came with a Moroccan pastry which was tasty. There is a small shop on site, mainly selling traditional Moroccan gifts but it was a bit pricey, there is also a small book shop. The Love Gallery displays the Yves Saint Laurent artwork posters that were produced each year. The garden does get very busy with tour bus loads of tourists so I would recommend going in the morning."

The buildings and walkways are cobalt blue amidst the most beautiful gardens. The site is run by Yves St. Laurens foundation in Paris. It was designed by French expatriate and furniture maker Jacques Majorelle in the 30's. There are many birds, cacti, and ponds in an exquisite environment. Do not go to Marrakech without seeing these gardens. I will attach some photos."

The Majorelle Gardens, also known as the YSL Gardens, is a colourful and cheerful space which manages to combine a sense of calm with pops of vibrant colour, a place for reflection yet also inspiration and a serenity amongst the hustle and bustle of this major Moroccan City. These botanical gardens are unique, especially in Marrakech where everything is so fast-paced and a little hectic at times, but they also combine nature and art and you can see why YSL chose to have his final resting place in this exquisite spot. There is an homage to the great designer with a collection of his works of art \u2013 fun, pop-art style posters with the central theme of love. Take your loved ones for a memorable stroll in this sublime space and absorb it\u2019s essence and beauty as you take a deep breath and appreciate all the wonderful things in your life."

It does not make this any less of a stop but you should come prepared that the garden will be full of people. The garden has a nice collection of plants and a walkways on wood. The trees provide a nice cool shade. The museum has some art from local artists and some history of the local people. There is a small shop also attached to the museum.

We walked around once, taking in the picturesque views of the wildlife and plants within the garden before having some lunch in their outdoor cafe. The food was very good value again, considering it is the only place you can eat in there we expected it to be a little expensive but it wasn't. We then walked around for a second time to get some photographs.

The museum costs extra but is worth it - interesting and informative - not about the gardens so much, but about the local area and people.The garden is very well managed and maintained and has a great collection of cacti, and the water features are well laid out.Needless to say, there is Majorelle Blue everywhere, and it looks wonderful.Don't miss it if you're in Marrakech, it makes a change from the palaces and Madrassa etc."

It is only a small place and cost 50DH to enter with an additional 25DH to visit the berber museum once inside which was certainly worth a visit.The museum was really interesting BUT all the signs were in French and arabic, by the time the place started to fill up there was many english around so it was a little disappointing they could not have translated some of the information into english too, still i enjoyed looking at all the magnificent berber clothing and jewellery.Watch out for the taxi drivers when you leave that want to take you to see other places like spice markets or carpet shops, we had to be firm and insist they take us where we wanted to go or we would not pay"

Shop is missing a trick - no prints, no postcards, no cheaper smaller items.We bargained hard with the taxi drivers outside who had first quoted twice the price it had cost us to get there."

It is a little expensive compared to other attraction prices (50 dirhams to enter plus 25 dirhams if you want to visit the Berber Museum), but it is such a nice break from the dust, heat, hustle and bustle of the medina. There are a ton of different plants, ponds, and also turtles and fish to look at. There is also a nice cafe (again expensive compared to the food prices you can find in the medina) with very nice staff and good refreshments. I definitely recommend a visit to this garden to see a different side of Marrakech!"

Also I missed a (very large) sign and after another 100 yards the common 'i will help you, police knows about us and we are approved' guide came out from a shelter. It is quite easy to find really as there is a big sign and there are loads of horse drawn carriages on the main road where you turn left. The garden itself is beautiful but not very large. I went around 3 times to take pictures and was out within the hour. There is a cafe there as well but as a mint tea was 5 dirham more than the entrance fee to the gardens, I decided to get that somewhere else. Definitely worth a visit and overall a great experience."

The shade does keep the area somewhat cooler which I am sure will only become more welcome as the city becomes sweltering come June/July. The cafe is expensive but appeared to be serving crepes being enjoyed by more than a few.Wouldn't make it a set stop but would fit it in somewhere in the itinerary. I would save it as a \"tag along\" attraction - maybe save it for a quick stop on the day of your flight out of Marrakech like our group did - a nice finish to the trip and something a little more relaxing than the streetfight mentality of the souks..."

The taxi driver said it would only take 20 minutes to walk round but we spent a very relaxing 2 hours there and took alot of photographs. We also visited the museum within the grounds which was interesting as they had written guides in English unlike many other Marrakech attractions. It cost 60 Dirhams entry including the museum which was on the high side for Marrakech. The small gift shop was very expensive as was the cafe. We crossed the road outside the gardens and had and excellent lunch at a reasonable price. The day we vised was exceptionally hot so we really appreciated the shade but if you are expecting lots of colourful plants you may be disappointed. We had spare time to visit but I would not put it near the top of my list to visit.We walked back past all the caleche and taxi drivers and it took just over an hour,"

The garden cafe is a delight, serving a wide range of delicious food. No alcohol. The Berber Museum is a must. It is by far the best small museum on Berber culture and artefacts in the city. Beautiful examples of the items presented, perfectly displayed and lit.It's a pity about the poor, smelly, tourist horse-carts outside the garden gate - not to mention the outrageous level of rip off taxis awaiting the unwary (if you walk to the main road and hail a taxi you will get a much better price).

It is a place where you can reflect on all of the impressions you have made in crazy Marrakech. Dive deep into this small paradise and take in the spirit of this place.

Morocco and it's tourist trade seem oblivious to the fact that this city is experience-lite when it comes to entertaining the culturally curious tourist and after visiting the Medina and souks it soon loses it's appeal. The Jardin Majorelle is a brief glimpse of what could be offered by a visit to Marrakech if the authorities appreciated how fortunate they are to be getting this number of visitors. The aesthetics mimic a Japanese garden and the shocking contrast with Yves Saint Laurents cobalt blue used on all the buildings makes it a visual feast. A visit would be a sublime experience if not for the shear number of visitors pushing and jostling in what is quite a small area. A botanical garden is always a beautiful diversion in a city and Marrakech's climate would make it a natural choice.Try to pick a time when the level of tourists visiting Marrakech is low; the jardin Majorelle could be the perfect place to spend a quiet afternoon reading a good book and enjoying the calming effect of water features and lush vegetation."

Everything Is laid out beautifully, as if the garden were a piece of art.On our visit, and contrary to all our guide books, the Islamic Museum is now a Berber Museum. This was very well curated and the quality of the items on display were of a very high standard.Lunch at the cafe is also a very calm affair with enough choices to suit most people, and there is a large selection of interesting drinks.This is a gem and should be on every visitor's 'to do' list in Marrakesh, especially if you done the souks and old palaces.

Would not take small kids who are noisy and like to run. There are escorts to keep things quiet and zen like, and most plants have needles.But be sure to hit the cafe for an early lucious lunch. The Kafta was excellent.The Botique has some interesting gifts, but pricey. Be sure to go when the buses aren't there. It was crowded when we arrived, but then a short rain chased everyone off.

Amazing cactus and succulents, very well-maintained, set off very effectively in raked gravel. Could have benefited from better plant identification. The tour buses arrived around 10 am and the place was jam-packed with people not too interested in gardening or Berber culture - too bad since they took up a lot of space. Perhaps best to visit first thing in the a.m. or later in the afternoon.The museum of Berber culture is well worth the extra admission - extremely well-presented, good audiovisuals, very good examples of their art and daily use tools, clothing, etc. Just enough to give a good feel for them, without overwhelming you with hundreds of similar examples."

It was later renovated by Yves St Laurent and there is a memorial to him there as well as a display of the annual 'Love' cards he sent to his friends and colleagues each Christmas.The cafe was a pretty, relaxed courtyard where we enjoyed an ice cream.The straw chips looked amazing!

Last visit I tried the Avocado, date and Almond smoothie, absolutely delicious. Well worth visiting within the gardens is the fantastic Berber museum, good exhibits and interpretation and fabulous jewellery and costume displays. Again not huge but these three elements - garden, museum and restaurant - make an ideal afternoon excursion and one with a real feeling of calm (unless you go high season when its packed!)."

If you are a botanist specialized in cactii, it would probably be worthwhile, but otherwise it is just a small garden, well maintained, but nothing special. Would not recommend. There are very beautiful gardens all over Morocco which are free to enter.50 dirhams for a 10 minutes walk in garden, in Morocco, is not small money. Don't waste your time."

There are also various water themes which gave the gardens the feeling of tranquility it has. There is a Berber museum here which is well worth a visit. The cafe was very good and reasonably priced.

There are also lots of lovely water features - channels, fountains and ponds. the trees provide shade and coolness, and the atmosphere is one of peace and quiet. After Majorelle's death, the garden was neglected for some year's until it was taken over and restored by Yves St Laurent. there is also a very interesting Berber Museum, opened in 2011, with a collection of photographs, films, music, etc from the world of the Berbers.

There is a beautiful (but expensive) YSL gift shop inside as well as a gallery. The Berber Museum inside the gardens is also well worth a visit.If you want to combine the gardens with a horse drawn carriage ride, its ideal as there are plenty just at the end of the street."

There are lots of tropical plants to see with lots of different cacti and bamboo. It didn't cost alot to get in. I can't remember exactly how much but around \u00a34.50 per person. There is a very small museum in the gardens. We didn't pay the extra to see it as we were off to the Atlas mountains and did not have time. There is also a small cafe but again we didn't go in. There are limited toilets available, with attendants waiting for you to cross their palm with a few pence on the way in/out. They were very clean and tidy though. WhenYves Saint Laurent died in 2006 his ashes were scattered in what is now known as The memorial garden. Well worth a visit"

Unfortunately, when I visited, maintenance was being carried out in parts of the garden, meaning that several paths were out of bounds, which had an effect on the flow of visitors; it seemed really busy. Interesting cactuses and lots of shady places to sit. The Berber museum is definitely worth a visit - it's really well laid out, and there are information cards in English about all the exhibits. Small, but the best of the museums I visited in Marrakech. Nice, but pricy outdoor cafe, and good clean toilets. I've got a strange urge to paint everything yellow and Marjorelle Blue now. Caleche stand outside, but it's an easy walk from Gueliz and the Northern Medina riads."

The blue buildings were odd, but somehow fit in perfectly to the surroundings. There was plenty of great photo opportunities. There was even a dedicated area to Yves Saint Laurent, that was lovely as there were lots of pictures hanging up that he had designed.The problem we encountered that let the gardens down was the restaurant. we ordered drinks and ice creams, as it was fairly hot out and we had been walking a day. The restaurant was full and the guy took our order. We found that in Marrakech they take their time to serve food, but other people were coming in and ordering food and drinks, time passed the other people received their drinks and food. Still we waited.......and waited, until another waited asked and we said we were waiting on food, he disappeared and carried on serving people. 40 minutes went pass and still NOTHING!!!!.So, we left. Outside the gardens was a excellent drink place where we settled to have a drink. This experience with the restaurant let the garden down and I understand that they were busy, but to serve others who came in after us. Even if I just had the drink then I would have been happy. Other than that it was a great day out with my family, (Dad, Mum and Sister)"

Before going to Morocco I already had my heart set on going here, all the pictures I saw were wonderful and as a keen photographer I was eager to check it out.We went in March and the temperature in the city was higher than we're used to, but as soon as we entered the Jardin Majorelle it was cool and shady, a complete contrast to the hot and hectic city outside. A lovely place to stroll and admire the wonderful collection of plants and odd cacti. There are numerous water features which add to the beauty. Also a rather bizarre collection of bamboo canes which have been carved and scratched with visitors' graffiti, which is rather unique if a bit untidy. There is a caf\u00e9 within the gardens which is very pretty but also rather over priced which was a shame as it put us off buying anything. This and the fact that it was smaller than I was hoping are the only bad points. I would defiantly recommend for those who enjoy gardens and having a bit of quiet time, make sure to also visit the museum tucked away in the gardens!"

You can walk around and look at the extremely well-kept gravel gardens and cacti, or find a shady spot to settle down in and enjoy the view over the fish ponds and bright blue and yellow museum. Here you'll also find a memorial to Yves Saint-Laurent, who owned the gardens; a Berber museum which easily has one of the best collections in the city; and a couple of art galleries to take a look at. We ended up spending half the day here - well worth the \u00a32!"

It does not take that long to walk around the gardens so the 30 minutes we had been given by our horse and carridage drivers was plenty long enough. However, for those who wanted to stay longer there is a cafe within the gardens and also a further museum which we did not pay the extra to visit.The entrance price was quite expensive for the size of the gardens (around \u00a316 each).

We walked for miles in squalor, dust and heat to reach this supposedly not to be missed garden and couldn't believe what the fuss is all about! The entrance fee of 75DH was ridiculous for visiting a garden full of bamboo and cactus and a small museum with nothing to write home about. The environment is serene and peaceful, and is very well kept with lovely primary coloured walls and paths, but the YSL monument is underwhelming and there is really nothing of great interest to draw people. I think the lack of strong landmarks in Marrakech makes this an over-rated draw for European visitors.One bright spot is the nice if expensive cafe in its own walled garden with friendly staff and good food."

The canopy of leaves above you dapples the ground around you and creates the sensation of being somewhere you've never been except in a dream. Water features and fountains cool in the shadows and obscure the sounds of the surrounding city. There are two structures painted a startling dense blue, one a viewing pavillion and the other an exotic little building housing a Berber Museum showing St.Laurent's extraordinary collection of Berber Jewellry and Tribal Costumes. There is an excellent bookshop and photographic prints at reasonable prices. Around the back of the Museum is a courtyard cafe with excellent food and refreshments. We spent about 3 hours or more in this garden adding lunch in our reluctance to leave the place.St. Laurent was born in Africa and built his getaway home adjacent to the garden. You can glimpse it with it's fanciful turrets and terraces through the greenery. It is not open to the public. The garden requires a modest charge to visit. An absolute must."

Maybe more picturesque in the afternoon though. 50DH for entry and another 50 for museum. Well-run and well-kept garden.The cafe has free WiFi. Delicious food at tourist prices. Nice way to enjoy the garden view/setting at end of our tour.Took a taxi to Majorelle and from Djemaa el fna Square for 25-30DH each way. 15-20 mins ride depending on traffic."

There is also a cafe to have a bite to eat and/or a drink, though we didn't use this.There is a little free gallery of so of Yves Saint Laurent's work in the Jardin which has some nice pieces in it. There is a shop where you can get copies of these works and some Berber themed posters, books etc.The museum contains a lot of Berber history and was very interesting. It has arrays of Berber clothing and jewellery etc. The museum is not recommended for those with small children as they do not allow pushchairs so we had to carry him.There is a Berber themed shop, though this was expensive."

Morocco/Marrakesh & tour operators really need to work on this aspect as it leaves an awful lot to be desired. In addition we witnessed our 3rd out of 5 accidents during that day - pedestrians are really not considered that important it would seem. Therefore by the time we reached the gardens we were probably not in the right frame of mind to fully appreciate the gardens."

What these gardens are, in a relatively small space of around 10,000 sq m or 2 acres, are a bunch of cacti, palm trees and bamboo nicely mature and well tended. Around the gardens are shocking yellow, blue and ochre pots against blue walls, I thought they were horrible plastic until I examined them and found they were painted terracotta. The visitor is restricted to the pathways, these are inevitably crowded and often quite noisy which destroys the atmosphere a little (and makes taking photos a bit difficult). There are some water features and a couple of block-built pavilions, an expensive caf\u00e9 and a museum which I didn't see. The taxi from the old town to here, waiting for the 30 minutes we were inside and returning us to the town centre cost Dh100 which was the cost of the entry to the gardens. This is \u20ac5 each which is not expensive by Western standards but is quite expensive in Morocco. Yes it was worth it but I'm not sure you would bother in an environment less boring that Marrakech.The best bit, turn right out of the exit, walk 30m until you hit the main road, turn left and 10m on your left is a brand new alcohol supermarket with very keen prices. Not easy to find beer in Marrakech so worth the trip for this alone!"

Ni It's really worth paying the extra to go into the small but perfectly formed Museum of Berber life, which has intelligent and informative captioning ( English translations available) and good design. The 'starlight infinity room' displaying jewellery made sense for us as we has just been on a tour of the Berber Villages in the landscapes of the Atlas Mountains, and you could see how they were trying to express some sense of the almost spiritual power of the space of those landscapes. Gift shops also quite smart and high end, good cafe."

The gardens are intriguing, calming, peaceful and packed with exotic plants, colourful pots and shady pools. If you are a photographer you'll love the colours. It wasn't too busy when we went so this no doubt added to the ambience; it may be a bit hectic in the height of season. Easy walk from all areas of the medina. Tip, avoid the touristy restaurants outside, there are plenty of better choices nearby."

Could hear birds and breathe relatively clean air - a nice break from from the moped exhause, noise and pestering by the merchants of Medina Marrakech. It sort of makes you feel sorry for the people of Morroco that it seems the most beautiful diversions from the native culture were created as walled off mansions built by the French. Nice to have these jems, but it does emphasize the divide between the haves and have-nots. My children feel very, very fortunate to be born in a country with so many conveniences unheard of in the rest of the world. The walk from Medina Marrakech to this garden emphasizes this..."

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this was the most average of all the gardens we saw in Morocco. The entry fee was expensive, the gift shops uninspired (they were selling prints of Persian tilework in the Berber museum shop - this seemed patronising, and quite absurd), the pond seemed cloudy, and nothing was quite well cared for enough. Possibly it's also a taste thing - the famous Majorelle blue didn't thrill me as I'd thought it would; it seemed to wash out the sky (how do you make the Moroccan sky look BAD?), and it greyed the skin of everyone I photographed against it. The Berber museum is small but well displayed. We liked the little alcove with YSL's yearly 'love' posters. Otherwise it sort of felt like we'd wandered into an 80's primary colour fashion shoot, but not in a good way. All in all, not the fabulous we were expecting."

It's the most expensive tourist attraction in the city.The gardens themselves are small. Very beautiful, but you don't need more than 30 minutes to see the whole thing. The Berber Museum is absolutely tiny, and entirely in the French language, except for a handful of panels written in English. Don't bother with the Museum. It's a total waste of money.There is a small caf\u00e9 inside the gardens. It is a pleasant environment for some relaxation. However, the prices are horrendously expensive for what you get. And the food is not very nice. They have a captive tourist audience and they take full advantage knowing that they will never see these customers ever again so why bother with decent food?There is a Yves Saint Laurent Memorial inside the gardens. It's just a 3 foot concrete column on a plinth. Totally underwhelming. There is also something called the 'Galerie Love' inside the garden, dedicated to YSL's art. Again, underwhelming.There is also a gift shop next to the 'Galerie Love'. This is perhaps the biggest rip-off of them all. Even something as simple as a candle can cost 30 Euros! Disgraceful gouging.And outside the gardens you will be harassed VERY aggressively by taxi drivers and people selling counterfeit wrist watches. You have to be quite rude to get them to leave you alone as they will persistently follow you down the street even if you totally ignore them!Overall - Definitely not worth visiting this place unless you want to tick it off your list. Don't bother with the Berber Museum and you should probably avoid buying any desserts from the caf\u00e9 as they are awful and expensive."

Designed by the late Yves Saint Laurent, the garden is not big, but what it lacks in size it certainly more than makes up for in 'wow' factor. Whilst the planting comprises for the most part bamboo (rustling gently in the warm breeze) and a myriad of cacti and succulents, you are not left wanting for colour. The pots and buildings are painted in the richest of hues: yellow, terraccoto, mauve and of course the stunning Majorelle blue itself. I defy you not to want to bring something home in that colour alone after having visited the gardens. Take light refreshments at the restaurant or visit the Berber museum. We took a caleche (horse-drawn carriage) to the gardens but walked back to the souks after."

It's a beautifully presented display of artefacts from the many tribes who live on and around the Atlas mountains, clearly described in French, English and Arabic. It also gives you a good idea of what's real and what's not if you go shopping later in the Souks. There's a good little illustrated guide you can buy on your way out - no need for it in the museum as it repeats what you're told in the captions.Well worth the extra 25 dirham on the admission price to the Jardin Majorelle."

After having entered to the garden, we have an impression to be in a rainforest (I've never been) Very green and very nice bamboos and exotoc trees, flowers everywhere. Very well kept. Incredibely nice and colored potsherds. Even the light is missiong sometimes, you defintiely need to have a good camera to take nice pictures, even for my iphone it was sometimes too dark. In the garden you have the Berber Museum where you can find out how people lived couple os centuries ago. The shops in the Garden are highly priced, the caffe of the museum is not the cheapest neither, but the it has a small teracce garden, very cosy and symphatic. When finished, just take a \"caleche\" you can find them next to the garden. If you go to the MEdina, eg. Jemaa el Fna, don't pay more then 120 dirhams. We paied 150, but asked the driver to take a small tour of the medina walls and it was like if you would hired a professional guide. Our driver knew everything about the town, and was able to looking at the map, while horses ran alone....you have to try it!!"

I had been forewarned that it was pricey and not worth it. I didn't dine but glanced at a menu as i walked past. Pricey, yes.

I wore an orange dress and the contrast of the colors led to wonderful photos. Also, the Museum of Islamic Art is absolutely worth the visit. What I find strange is that it's not really a muslim museum. It should be called ''the Berber Museum'', because it focuses completely on the Berber culture. Nevertheless, the museum was great!

The garden was created originally by Majorelle and after his passing his family then sold the property to Yves St Laurent, who along with his partner kept it going, then after his passing have left it so that all can come and see it. Make your trip around lunchtime as there is a wonderful cafe/restaurant, with great food."

It is compact but very well designed and maintained. Predominantly palms and cacti so lots of interesting structures. Yes there are waves of coach parties (even in November) some more appreciative than others, but if you let them pass there are moment of calm. Our guide advised visiting early (they open at 8am) to avoid the crowds. We didn't have time for the museum but other friends said it was worthwhile if you have an interest in the culture of course."

Basically this is a very well manicured garden of Palms, bamboo, cacti etc but few flowers as such. I liked the bold blue and yellow colours on the Berber museum and surrounding structures. BUT AVOID the cafe/tea room--- so expensive for Marrakesh-- 3 Euro 50 (35 Dirhams) for a milky coffee. There is a high enough charge for the garden (50 Dirhams) and museum (25 Dirhams)!

The gardens are not large and there are not rows and rows of regimentally placed flowers, however I loved the bright vivid colours with the 'majorelle blue' bright yellow and green together - it's more of an escape from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech than a 'British Country Garden' type place (so don't go expecting that). The Berber Museum is well worth paying the extra 25LE for, beautifull exhibited items of clothing and jewellery - unfortunately no photography permitted and rucksacks are asked to be worn on your 'front' as to not bang or rub against any of the exhibits. Entrance is 50 Dirham and the Berber Museum costs an additional 25DH"

The hustle and bustle, the bartering and the banter, plus swerving out of the way of approaching scooters, bikes and donkeys are all part of the attraction of Marrakech, but sometimes you just want a bit of peace and quiet where no-one will try to sell you something, tempt you into their restaurant, offer to be your guide or run you over. Jardin Majorelle is the very place. I have been to the Jardin Majorelle before and find it inspirational. I am drawn to the contrast between the colours: the bright tropical foliage and the magenta bougainvillea; the yellow, orange and powder blue plant pots along terracotta paths and around murky pools. And, of course, the bright cobalt bleu majorellebuildings against the blindingly bright cloudless sky. The other big attractions are the tranquillity \u2013 interrupted only by the whispers of visitors and the tinkling of the fountains \u2013 and the shade. There is also a brand new museum of Berber culture, which we didn\u2019t visit on this occasion, preferring to laze in the shadows of the palms. The caf\u00e9 \u2013 in a small courtyard \u2013 is also excellent, although the prices are far higher than the world outside the walls!"

The green, green, green is restful on the eyes, the lush and exotic plantings good for your soul and the strategic seating invites weary feet. And while you are there, don't miss the small museum devoted to the artisanal work of the Berbers of Morocco. This is by far the best museum I have ever experienced in Morocco.....especially the unforgettable, octagonal, starry desert sky room housing traditional jewellery. Listen for the sounds of a desert tribe somewhere in the distance and transport yourself to another era. For me, one of the finest and well curated displays I have ever seen."

We didn't pay to go in the museum, and just walked around the garden and the shops. I have to say I'm not really one to appreciate gardens so, although I thought it was nice, I wasn't really overwhelmed by it. My partner is however, and she loved it, so that was good enough for me. The one thing that we did both comment on was that there wasn't many flowers - but this could have just been down the time of year. There is a cafe on site, but we found it quite expensive, so went to one of the little ones outside before having a carriage ride back to the hotel, which was pretty good value and a nice way to travel back (being taken through some off the beaten track areas, so seeing a slightly different side of Marrakech) and completed a very pleasant morning."

I get that, but it has to be more going for it than that. It is a green oasis amongst a rather dry, arid area. I did enjoy the oversaturated bursts of color in the buildings and pottery against the greenery. That is unique, but the overall design seemed a little tired and haphazard. As a photographer, I was looking for some great shots to showcase this site, but I was hard-pressed to find any. The main house is probably the most striking due to color, but getting a photo from any vantage point was very difficult. It can make a pleasant stroll if time is no problem, but I would not overlook other sights to fit this into a jam-packed itinerary. If you are going to enjoy the Berber Musuem located in the main house, then this sight does warrant a little more attention. Be aware that the sight is outside of the Medina tucked off a major street among very modern, non-descript housing blocks. This is not a charming neighborhood by any measure. Walking there from the Medina is not that much fun. Most people seem to take a cab or use a tour operator. Do your homework and make sure you have the time and inclination to spend time at this attraction."

I understand it is also fully wheelchair accessible.There is a memorial to Yves St Laurent in one corner which made us giggle. It was rather phallic, but perhaps that's just our dirty minds! He bought and restored the gardens after Majorelle's death in the 60s.The workmen wear uniforms of the same cobalt blue which is the keynote colour of the gardens and apparently that blue was originally inspired by the colour of French workmen's uniforms. So that's very appropriate.This garden is located a little out of the way so a taxi may be a good idea, but on no account should it be missed. It was a highlight of our trip. There are a few cafes and souvenir shopson the road outside and also a rather nice bookshop on the road opposite the entrance."

Can be busy, and is a bit of a circuit you follow rather than wander at will, but you can linger at any point and just chill. You can end up queueing behind others to get good photos. The cafe is great, can recommend the paninis, but can be difficult to get a table and you feel a bit awkward standing waiting. You do get 'misted' with water though, nice and cooling. The museum bit is good if you don't really like museums as it's small, but does have a few interesting things so you can say you've seen ancient daggers & carved doors & stuff. No good if you really are a history buff. Beware the taxi's outside, they charge a mint and won't come down in price as it's such a prime location. Walk a couple of blocks and get one on the street for half the fare. I'd say don't miss it but it is just a garden, and quite cultured rather than buzzy."

Date of visit 3/10/2012First, you need to dispel any ideas you have of gardens in the English sense - this is a garden designed for it's location and terrain using sculptural plantings of predominantly cacti and palms. It also has been designed to make the most of the limited colour palette - the predominantly green of the plants, the 'Moroccan' blues of the house and pots, interspersed by sunshine yellow - and the natural light and shade. Thadows and reflections can be as important as the physical plant.It is a calming oasis amidst the heat and bustle of Mararakch and a perfect retreat to contemplate. There are some seating areas dotted around and it is worth taking advantage of them and just sitting for a while and absorbing what it in front of your eyes.Various carp, frogs/toads (?) and turtles can be spotted at the ponds. Birds can be clearly heard singing although they were harder to spot.The garden opens at 8 am and closes, relatively early, at about 6pm. (Please confirm these times if you are going to visit as I may not be accurate. It is a shame it is not open in an evening too as it would be a magical place to walk around with appropriate lighting. I visited at about 10-30 am and although busy, you could still walk around and not feel that the garden was over crowded.Within the garden is a Berber Museum (sperate ticket). Although small, I thought it one of the best folk lore museums I have been to. It is worth taking time to watch the video displays of the old photo's (although a seat would have enhanced my experience). The jewellery display is particularly well done - you can find replica's of many of the items in the souks (although you may well be told they are antique too!).The cafe in the garden, although a pleasant location, is not cheap (think in terms of equivalent to UK tourist sites eg National Trust). I have to say I found this place the worst for service and attitude in all the places I stopped for a drink. My order did not come complete but they failed to tell me there was a problem. When I brought it to their attention all I got was a shrug of the shoulders and a gruff 'We've run out'. As stopping to take refreshement there was a treat for me this did rather take the edge off it for me.Toilets in the garden and at the cafe were clean.Ticket price: Garden 50 dh Berber Museum 25 dh - both bought at the entrance gate. N.B. People with mobility problems/disabilities - this is an ideal site to visit (assuming you like gardens) as it is flat and the paths are fairly wide in most parts. There is a bridge across a pond at one point that has some steps but there is an alternative route possible around the edge.I would love to visit this garden again someday as I am sure at different times of year the light conditions will give it other dimensions of appeal.Beware if you want to get a taxi when you leave here. My first impression was good because there was a marshall who seemed to be calling cars in order. My next impression was not so good as the driver wanted to charge me 90 dh for a relatively short journey that should cost 20 - 30 dh max. Needless to say I walked away from him but he called me back supposedly agreeing to my price but as I was about to get in he uttered another price which was still too much. To save all that hassle it is worth walking on and around the corner and picking up a car on the street - still being careful about price though."

After reading the reviews of Jardin Majorelle, my partner and I decided to take a stroll through the medina to outside of the walls to see the gardens. However after spending nearly \u00a310 to get in we had completed the repetitive walk round and seen the extremely boring memorial to YSL in about 15 minutes and that included a little sit down.I have been around the world and have seen some beautiful gardens which have been inspired but this a small garden with cacti and blue walls, there are much better things to see in Marrakech that are free.

Expensive to get in for Marrakech (50 dirhams for the gardens, plus 25 for the museum per person) and small in terms of size for gardens however very beautiful with the contrast of the colours ( cobalt blue) the plants ( succulents, cacti & bamboo) & water features. Delightful to photograph & plenty of seats to relax and take it all in .The museum was modern, exhibits beautifully displayed with info in English as well as French.Well worth a visit as lots of sites in Marrakech it's the architecture you view rather than artefacts - here there were exhibits of Berber clothes, jewellery, rugs which were artistically displayed.We ate outdoors in the courtyard cafe , ( tagine royal 100 dirhams) & whilst slightly expensive by Marrakech standards the ambience, food & service were very good .We spent 3 hours there in total were pleased to have made the effort to visit -it was a very welcome respite after a morning of historical site and souk visiting."

It's not that the gardens weren't beautiful, peaceful and inspiring (they were), just that it was all a bit monotonous after 10 or 15 minutes. Lots of trees, cacti and plants. Not sure what I was expecting really, lushious meadows and wildflowers perhaps.Several sections were closed off when we visited (I looked through the hordings though, no meadows behind there) which was a shame. Also, not the most relaxing layout.. you sort of go in at the start and walk around in a circle until you pop out at the end, kinda felt like visiting IKEA but without the furniture.There is a Berber museum on site which you have to pay extra for but which is well worth the money. Plenty of exhibits and a really enjoyable insight into life in the Atlas mountains. There is also a lovely cafe which is a nice place to chill out before heading back to the medina.All in all, worth a visit if gardens are your thing, but be sure to pay the extra for the museum."

It is not really 'walkable' from Djemma al Fnaa; if you take a 'petit taxi', make sure you negotiate a reasonable return fare IN ADVANCE. The taxi drivers always wait outside the gardens for you. Some will try to tell you that they will only wait 30 minutes or an hour- take no notice, they are just trying to bully you.Yves' personal contribution to the garden reflected his own talents; it was colour- but what colour...A special blue now known as 'bleu majorelle' as a background colour , then pots all painted in pale citrus colours. The plants are all ones that would flourish in a desert & some of them make the most extraordinary shapes.Although the garden is in a side street off one of Marrakech's main roads, it always feels peaceful inside and there are plenty of benches where one can just sit & meditate.Yves St Laurent's personal memorial is very simple but none the less, touching.There is a building in the centre of the garden which usually has on an exhibition of some sort related to clothing. A while back, I was lucky enough to be there when an exhibition of some of his original designs was running. More usually, there is an exhibition of Berber costumes, which are interesting.There is a cafe, where it is lovely to sit outside, or inside by a small waterfall. The food & drinks are not cheap, but all is high quality and beautifully presented.There is also a shop which I find very expensive.Like many visitors, I go back every time I visit Marrakech. It is genuinely unique and happily Yves left enough money in his will for the gardens to be maintained in perpetuity.The 'Majorelle' district is now one of the most expensive addresses in the city. There are some nice 'designer 'shops opposite which certainly contain some lovely things - but at sky high prices."

We came from the medina and travelled by cal\u00e8che (we negotiated a price from the main square to the gardens and back again, the driver waited for us whilst we visited and we paid him upon return to the square \u2013 it was a great way to travel and we didn\u2019t feel rushed or ripped off). It\u2019s a bit out of town so it\u2019s not recommended to walk it from the medina, there are plenty of taxis available but we thought going by cal\u00e8che hit two birds with one stone, making the journey there an experience as well as the gardens themselves. There is a prescribed route around the gardens, it\u2019s a tranquil place and home to plenty of birdlife and turtles. The colours are vibrant and beautiful. The size and variety of cacti are very impressive as well. It\u2019s not a long walk to take everything in, plenty of benches to stop and admire the plants and so on, so those who are less mobile or those with younger children shouldn\u2019t find them too much of a challenge.

We walked along the route (can be done in about 10 minutes at a slow pace) and ended up in a highly overpriced caffe/restaurant which is a part of the garden. 50 mad for a bottle of sparkling water - expensive even by European standards. The garden itself is nice but thats all it really is. I definitely wouldn't go again as it just isnt all that interesting / picturesque. Maybe worth a quick visit for anyone on holiday in Marrakech but try ad have a low expectation so you aren't disappointed at the end."

The guide told us to take our time as its a special and romantic place, my take on the place is that its a load of Cacti and a nice little pond. The pond was interesting as it had little terrapins in it that we loved but think this should be a free public area and if you want to see it no need for a 'guided tour' which we found terrible and overpriced but just get a taxi here (it costs next to nothing to get in)Nice but perhaps a bit overrated, we spent 10-15 mins here and was a bit under-whelmed especially as the guide had spent 10 minutes previously building it up."

Even though there were many other tourists and school groups, it's a calming escape from the hustle and bustle of the medina. My husband and I decided to stop here on the way to the Atlas mountains for a hike. In addition to the more tropical plants like vibrant bougainvilleas, there are water and cactus gardens. You can get some great pictures with the incredibly vivid blue used on the property. See what I mean with a google image search."

There is a restaurant which is nicely laid out for a drink/snack - prices looked quite high but we didn't go in.My other piece of advice is, if taking a taxi here, ask for them to use the meter (this applies to anywhere around the city), because tourist traps such as these attract ridiculous fares [many drivers quoted us 50/60MAD and we got there for 8 in the end...]) - I would also recommend walking up to the taxi rank 100m up the road, rather than paying inflated prices as you leave."

The garden was very nice, but really was nothing unique, beyond being a nice, medium-sized botanical garden, comperable to what you'd expect to find in most major cities. It was, however, a nice respite from the heat and mayhem of the medina. I've heard that going early allows you to avoid the crowds. We went around 11 am, and it was fairly busy.A major highlight for us was visiting the attached Berber museum. Definitely worth the extra entrance fee. I thought the displayed jewelry was incredible. We had already visited some of the Berber regions of Morocco, so seeing the exhibits helped us put context to our experiences.In summary: gardens = ok, museum = excellent."

It is here where YSL asked for his ashes to be scattered after his death. Walking into the garden, there is a sense of tranquility and colour that is very welcoming. The garden was originally a private garden owned by Jacques Majorelle, a French painter who took residence in Marrakech. He selected plants from all parts of the world and created an artistic palate that he shared when he opened the garden to the public in 1947. Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berg\u00e9 were friends with Jacques Majorelle while they were living in Marrakech. When Jacque Majorelle died in a car accident, YSL and Pierre Berg\u00e9 purchased the garden and restored the property to ensure its continuing existence. Within the garden, there is Mus\u00e9e Berb\u00e8re. The museum is housed in the former painting studio of Jacques Majorelle. The exhibits are of the various indigenous tribes of Northern Africa (from the Rif Mountains to the Sahara desert). The displays were beautifully and professionally presented \u2013 a real treat to the visual senses. They provide insight into how these tribes influenced and continue to influence Moroccan culture. The museum is an extra cost to the overall price of visiting the gardens but well worth the price. There is a fabulous display of Berber jewellery (you can see YSL and Pierre Berge\u2019s influence most prominently here \u2013 first class all the way) \u2013 this was my favourite part of the museum. It\u2019s a shame to miss this museum as it does complete the visit of Le Jardin Majorelle. I would definitely recommend a visit to this lovely oasis in the middle of Marrakech."

I had been to the Majorelle Gardens before in October of previous year but I had rushed through the gardens that first time so this time, I took my time and enjoyed the gardens with a different frame of mind and found it even more engaging and captivating as I concentrated on the surroundings, the textures and the colours. I even noticed this time the \"architecture\" of the plants and had a great time photographing them. I especially enjoyed looking at the stark vibrant blue of the buildings that you don't find anywhere else in Marrakech. For 50 dirhams I experienced again the Matisse-like painting in living colour! Spend some quality time here!"

They're best visited earlier in the day before the coach trips disgorge as the gardens as small. However their clever design gives a feeling of space and you can wander around easily for a couple of hours. You really need your camera as every turn in the path brings another photo opportunity! Stunning bright colours and you can really see how the garden would have inspired Yves st Laurent.. A lovely restful place and its hard to believe that the madness of Marrakech is just outside those walls. There is a cafe/resturant there and you can buy water at a kiosk at a reasonable price. There is also a small gift shop and a somewhat 'up tight' boutique shop."

We paid a total of 150dh for two to visit the gardens and the small museum on berber culture and history (exchange rate at the time \u00a31 =13.3 dh). Glad we spent the extra on the museum otherwise we would have been in and out out very quickly. There are other, free gardens around the city (e.g. next to the Koutoubia mosque) which were far more pleasant."

Bought by fashion designer Yves St Laurent and his partner many years ago when it was almost condemned to be destroyed, the gardens are now a bouquet of vibrant colours and exquisite textures. Take your time walking through this small paradise to appreciate the many tropical plants, their arrangements and the amazing landscaping. Come early because the tour bus crowds will take away your full enjoyment of this treat if you arrive after 11 AM. Also by coming early you may have breakfast at a gem of a an outdoor cafe inside the Gardens, and savour the bright morning sun and chirping of the birds. Don't miss the museum of Berber Arts inside the Gardens. Painted a brilliant blue, this small museum will open your eyes to the culture and lifestyle of the indigenous Berbers. All in all a wonder of a place, and one of the reasons why we travel. I tip my hat to Monsieur St Laurent and his partner. Merci beaucoup!"

Inside you approach the bamboo section and as some people have already mentioned there are a few etched in initials in the bamboo which is a bit of a shame. YYou then walk towards the big blue building (the museum) and before you reach it you come accross the monument to YSL which is a bit anti-climatic. We took in the gift shop and the little room showcasing some of YSL's art work which shows why he stuck to being a designer. You then come to the cactus area which was my favourite section and then you find yourself out of the exit. Give this a skip, even the taxi driver on the way said to go to the Palmeraie instead."

I do not understand how anybody could say they didn't enjoy the wonderful vibrant colours of this beautiful place. We knew it wasn't huge, but this is quality not quantity. When we had walked all around in one direction, we turned around and had quite different views in the opposite direction. It was so tranquil and we enjoyed the birds singing. The exhibits in the Berber museum were different, interesting and unique. Entrance is now 60D, with extra 20D for the museum/Our only complaint was the cafe - there were so many people smoking (as smoking is not permitted in the gardens itself) and the open area had a covering of strips of canvas which only served to keep the smoke in. Also the prices were exhorbitant, but we ordered the soup at 60D (\u00a35) and sat for about 30 mins before the waiter came back to say there was no soup!! Disgusted that he had not told us that on ordering it, we left and took our custom elsewhere. Drinks were also 60D. We would advise people to avoid this overpriced, smokey tourist trap (cafe) and eat elsewhere, but the gardens are well worth a visit - there's nothing like them anywhere else we have been."

My husband and I visited Majorelle Garden as we had heard it was a must see!We paid around \u00a36-7 per person to see a small garden with some impressive cactus and plants. It was a nice relaxing place to sit and do nothing for an hour!I think the entrance should have been slightly cheaper to reflect what you're actually going to be seeing!If you're a nature lover and like plants etc, but you might appreciate the place more than we did.I think the place is over hyped due to the Yves Saint Laurent connection to the garden (as his ashes are scattered in this garden).Lets put it this way - you're not going to miss out if you don't go there!!!"

Add in a cab there and back (having had to haggle down from an especially high rate on departure too) and it was easily our most expensive visit during our stay. We didn't linger in the cafe when we saw the cheapest food was 70D and a club sandwich 120D!"

Though crowded with people (February), it was a very serene and nice place. Fresh air, hoorah! Minor thing is the price. To see the gardens we paid 100 MAD, which is about 10 euros for the two of us. This is quite some money for just half an hour looking around. Of course you can spend more time by sitting in the restaurant or visiting the museum, but that would only mean spending more money. We enjoyed the photogenic surroundings and peaceful atmosphere, but it was a pity that so many people did the same."

I'm not really a gardener though, so I walked round it in 5 minutes, peered into the stagnant pond and then moved onto the art!What in my opinion it IS worth going for is the little gallery with all the 'Love' prints that YSL made-they are unique and beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed looking at them.I'm sure if you were here in the summer this place would be a cool, shady godsend, I just wouldn't put it at the top of your agenda in Morocco."

Bright yellow and blue painted pots contrasting with the limpid pale turquoise of the fountain waters, combined with the extraordinary sculptural shapes of the cactus garden (including some really unusual species) make it an aesthete's heaven. I would also highly recommend the new Berber Museum - the best museography in Morocco - and the erudite but accessible commentary. It really brought home the millennial character of Berber culture and how miraculously it has survived today, grafted onto Arab culture, having maintained extraordinary decorative skills combined with that tradition of hospitality, an ancient echo of their hunter gatherer origins."

It is peaceful and calm, lots of stunning cacti and beautiful blue, orange and lemon coloured pots. A fascinating blend of Morrocan and European design. Nice cafe, small museum, classy and quite expensive gift shop. Outside there are some more boutique -type gift shops, quite a contrast to the hustle and bustle of the Medina. In January this wasn't too crowded and the temperature was perfect. Take a good camera!"

Upon entering one finds a complete contrast to the sometimes dusty roadway of Morocco - be tantalized with blasts of blues and greens and yellows. Note the attention to detail along each line of the architecture, and leafy pathways. Don't forget to stop at the shops - there are some amazing posters and smaller sized art perfect for gifts or home. We booked an hour to explore Majorelle and grabbed a nibble nearby."

What a lovely trip!The most noteworthy aspects of the Jardin Majorelle are the wonderful vibrant colors, and the peaceful atmosphere. After all the bustling madness of the souks and the Medina, it was so nice to have a respite like that. When we were there, an exhibit about fashion icon Yves Saint Laurent's patronage of the garden had just ended; but his presence was still keenly felt.Incidentally, our driver was very nice, the drive through the urban sprawl (nondescript hotels and apartment buildings, etc.) was fun, and as I remember it, the driver's charge was very reasonable."

There really isn't much to see in the garden and it is not near anything else. I didn't go inside the museum in the gardens based on other reviews read on here and to be honest I couldn't wait to leave after arriving and being utterly disappointed.

We took a walk from our hotel up to Majorel Gardens, evading marauding Moroccan drivers, who are quite honestly mad as hatters on the roads!We followed the map until we saw a sign for the gardens, and continued following the signs until we came upon it. There was a small charge to get in, and another small charge if you wanted to visit the museum that's inside as well. We opted for just the gardens, and spent a very nice hour or so wandering around, and taking pictures of the flowers and plants. It's amazing how peaceful the gardens are, considering the noise of the traffic which is just outside its walls.There is a small tea garden, where you can order beverages and snacks, slightly higher prices than you would expect in a normal Moroccan caf\u00e9, but clean, tidy surroundings, and good service.There is also a small boutique where you can buy various items, much dearer than you can barter for, but if you're not much of a one for bartering, then it's nice to have prices on things...for all I know you might even be able to haggle in there!There was a room with a selection of paintings to view, and some books on Moroccan art to browse through.All in all, a nice way to spend an hour or two!"

Cafe inside serves nice sandwiches and drinks. There are a few interesting shops and a supermarket just near the entrance of the Garden.

I visited it in November and also New Year's Eve.It cost 40 local dirhams or roughly 4 Euros and additional 20 (2 Euros) if you choose to visit the Berber museum within the compound. The November visit was just stunning and that is what made me visit again to record some video. I was a wee bit disappointed for there was lack of colours and not as many flowers. The sun being low on the horizon at that time of the year took away from the magnificent colours of the first visit. So you should go as early as possible and morning preferably. Take a taxi of horse drawn carriage but make sure you fix the price of the ride before embarking."

A good place to go for a respite but in my opinion, not worth the entrance fee if you have a chance to see the real thing elsewhere.

The pathways lead you round the whole garden from dappled shade in the bamboo space to sunny, open areas round the ponds and the museum building. There are numerous benches where you can sit in the calm atmosphere and reflect.It's generally best to visit earlier (before 11.00) or after 15.30 as the bus parties tend to visit in the middle of the day and it can get crowded as it's not a huge garden.I don't understand how anyone could fail to be charmed by this place."

Do not believe the high reviews of this place in Marrakech, we have been to Marrakech twice, absolutely loved the country but I have to inform anyone reading this that the Majorelle Gardens was a waste of time and not to bother going. Before going to Marrakech we bought several guide books to swat up on, all boasting that \"Majorelle Gardens\" is the place to go and is a \"must see\" when visiting Marrakech. When we finally got there what an anti-climax! We should have listened to the taxi drivers and even the hotel manager who was directing us to visit other gardens or the Palmerie. I thought they just wanted our money and a longer fare but they turned out to be right. We were greeted at Majorelle Gardens by two rather obnoxious security guards, the place looked very small and we wanted just general information about the place, we had our own food and wanted to know if there was an area we could sit and eat, the ticket seller said yes, the security guards saw we had our own food and said no and tried to take our food. We did not want to eat in a touristy cafe on garden ground which we were envisaging selling overpriced european food ala hotel food. We decided to walk round the garden, there was no picnic eating area, the garden had no open air and in Febuary in Marrakech the shade can get very very cold, even in the day. There was nothing to this garden but paths through lots of bamboo. There was not one thing in this \"garden\" that I could justify paying the 40DH entry for. I would avoid this place like the plague, do not believe the mindless rubbish the guide books try and feed you with. This was the lowlight of our trip and something we would never do again nor recommend to anyone ever thinking of visiting Marrakech. Instead visit the Palmarie, not a \"garden\" as such but that was far more interesting and not so much a tourist trap with only one thing in mind which is to squeeze every tourist for every last penny they have. If you want a good garden the Cyber Parc beat this by far. In my opinion though there are a million and one more interesting things to do than visit the gardens, especially the Majorelle Gardens. It is very small and could be walked round in 5-10 minutes."

Marrakech's Jardin Majorelle is superlative - almost sanctuary-like if you go early. Reminds me of Monet's house/garden in Giverny, France! Morocco is leagues ahead of Jordan. Morocco is much more colourful and showcases the Arab and Islamic culture in a more sensitive and representative tone. Also, the Berber and other tribal art and culture are alive. Most of all, the warmth of Moroccans - whether in big cities like Marrakech, Casablanca or in tiny villages along hiking trails - is most welcoming. Even though they are poor, they have genuine smiles - unlike the Jordanians who are mostly surly and $$$-minded.Make time to do oasis walks and savour the stunning vistas of various kasbahs (forts), whether small or big. Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator are shot in Morocco for a good reason! Our guide, Aziz, is trained in law but free-lancing as a tour guide due to Morocco's economic hardship. Aziz went the extra mile to shar the nuances and inside track during our trip. I still keep in touch with Aziz via e-mail as he is a young man worthy of tour referrals for FITs and small tour groups."

The plants are amazing, tall and well-cared for, bamboos, palms, trees, aquatic plants; the building and infrastructure colours are strong and startling, the air is full of birdsong and splashing water yet the overall feel is relaxed and peaceful. The garden was created in the twenties by painter Jacques Majorelle and it is a real delight and despite plenty of visitors didn't feel crowded. It's a must-see for any serious traveller to Marrakech. It's a pity the plants aren't labelled as many were unusual or rare, but we discovered later that there is a guide book which could be worth using as a guide"

From cacti and other succulents, the grove of asiatic bamboos (perhaps sadly disfigured by teenage carvings - but hey (pun intended!) bamboo is a grass after all - to the lilies in the water features, the Norfolk pines (neither from Norfork nor are conifers, but I nitpick here) and the tradescantias and zebrinas The overall impression that we came away with was pleasurable."

They were much smaller than I expected and consisted of biggish beds planted with similar plants e.g bamboo, cacti, grasses etc. I believe they are meant to represent the 5 continents but I had difficulty working this out. The lilly pool was the prettiest part for us; there were some small turtles sunning themselves on the edge.The cafe was pleasant but a little expensive, the shop was outrageously expensive!There is a Berber museum within the grounds which is an extra 25 dirhams to visit, if you are even remotely interested in this culture it is well worth the extra as it has some fascinating artifacts inclusing some stunning jewellery."

We visited the Majorelle Garden when it opened at 8a.m. as we wanted to savour this artistic oasis before busloads of tourists descended upon it. At that hour it was so tranquil, numerous birds were singing in the palm trees, and the shady walkways and various water features helped keep it cool.Don\u2019t expect to find a lot of colourful flowers here as the essence of the garden seems to be more about juxtapositions of texture, shape and foliage, enhanced by the vivid deep cobalt blue paint which Majorelle borrowed from Berber house decoration and made the signature feature of his garden, using it here on pots, tilework, walls and buildings.  The plant collection is extraordinary, with a mini forest of whispering bamboo, cacti - some of which have attained amazing girth and startling height, palm trees, succulents growing in painted blue, lemon or ochre pots, and aquatic plants including lovely water lilies. Unlike Monet\u2019s free form water lily pond at Giverny, Majorelle\u2019s pond has strict geometric lines, and the stunning reflections in the water include the tops of palm trees, lending it a fantastically exotic aspect. The use of terracotta gravel to surround plants in the garden beds and reddish paint on the cement paths adds yet more colour to the garden.This small garden in Marrakech is a photographer\u2019s dream, and a must-see for anyone interested in gardening and landscaping. A caf\u00e9, gift-shop, free toilets, and museum are located inside the garden. It opens daily at 8a.m. (9a.m. during Ramadan) and admission is 40dh (garden only) additional 20dh for museum admission."

First the price was about four times the average charge for garden. Secondly, it is a design which smacks of pastiche and derivativeness (e.g. the use of Chefchaouen type blue) with no eye for perspective or proportion. It is interesting to walk round but of limited creativity. Try instead the gardens in the Bahia Palace in Marrakech (10 DH), or Jardin Jnan Sbil gardens in Fes or the Moulay Ali Cherif Mausoleum in Rissani south east Morocco"

The plants and ponds are well kept, I have never so many types of cacti in one place. Good place to have a romantic, relaxing walk and to clean your lungs."

The colours are beautiful, and the trees provide lots of shelter. Not really a place for little'uns as there isn't really anything for them there other than the view, and cacti are spikey fellows to play with. A few turtles, fish, and visiting birds provide wildlife. Nice for a peaceful stroll, and to pass an hour away with a book.You can easily view the garden within 30 mins, but worth taking a little longer and relaxing. Unsure of museum, as it was sadly closed when I visited. Inexpensive entrance fee. Bags are searched upon entry. Could just about manage a wheelchair and buggie, but definitely an adult attraction. Try to visit early morning or late afternoon when less people around, as this is definitely a place to lose yourself in tranquility."

We spent a while in the cafe as it was much cooler than the garden which was like a sauna! There is a museum you can pay extra to visit, there is a gift shop and a room with some pictures in.. Not entirely sure what the point was but it was something to do with Yves Saint Laurent. I was too hot to care at that time. On our way out, one of the staff in the blue tshirts offered to take our picture, so we let him, but he required a tip for this. We didn't expect that but we probably should have!

The garden is very well kept. What I think was very sad is how so many people just had to engrave their names in the plants and bamboo. Besides that and the garden being very small this place is definitely worth visiting. We payed 40 dirham per person and we spent about 90 minutes in the garden. Which should be more then enough unless you would also like to sit and relax at the terrace."

Except of course that 95% of visitors to the garden are tourists and the cost of entry pretty much rules out the great majority of the people of Marrakech from being able to see the gardens.I found the Cyber Parc to be just as interesting to walk around and because it was open to anyone it felt actually like a part of the city rather than some artificial 'westerners' hiding place.In summary, it was a nice garden and quite peaceful, but the cost and exclusory nature of it annoyed me."

The nature here is a true, living organism that kindly welcomes you by a hug with all of its colours and scents. Please forgive me being a bit sentimental, but it's just the way this oasis made me feel :-)It's basically a kind of a botanical garden - lots of cacti, succulents and other exotic plants - but it's very special. The colours here are amazing (even on the toilets! :D), rich and very vivid, contrasts are almost eye-blinding in their expressiveness, and still at the same time, this place has the power to make you forget about everything and calm you down.Of course this is valid only for the type of people who LET it to do so and who enjoy these kind of things - nature, flowers, peace and a bit of philosophy maybe :-) If you're not into nature that much, it would probably be a waste of time for you.

Marjorelle Gardens was one of the attractions I wanted to visit on our recent trip to Marrakech as I'm interested in different garden styles. I certainly wasn't disappointed. There was a cooling and calming atmosphere to the place as we walked along the pathways through the various garden rooms. I was quite taken by the colours which dominated - yellow, blue and orange, and the plants blended so well with these. The cacti garden is quite superb and extensive and quite a photographer's paradise with the many varieties of cacti and the interesting ways they show themselves through their flowers and spikes. Even my husband said it was one of the best he'd walked through! A must on a visit to Marrakech."

Quite a nice garden, made up of various palms, some shady spots, and a cactus garden. The courtyard cafe is pleasant with cooling mist jets and we had lunch there. It is rather expensive though, costing about \u00a310 each for a panini with salad. The museum was closed when we were there."

The garden has been open to the public since 1947.It a serene garden full of \"architectural\" type of cactii, bamboo,palms and plants native to Morocco. Exceptionally well kept - good walkways. A camera is an absolute must!! The house, which is a museum, was closed for renovation during our visit (April 2010). There is a cafe (did not try it) and also a \"boutique\" shop selling very expensive items!Since Majorelle's death in the 60's, Yves Saint Laurent (died 2008) and Pierre Berge bought and restored the property and subsequently established a trust to ensure the continued furure of the garden. Give at least two hours to vist and take in the beauty and calm of this lovely garden."

The Jardin Majorelle is a peaceful, cool & tranquil respite from the hot , bustling medina of Marrakech.A photographer's delight ,there are so many opportunuties to capture the perfect arty shot of the striking, spiky cactus against the cool backdrop of the 'Rive Gauche' blue artists studio.I strongly reccomend the beautiful courtyard cafe for lunch or a refreshing drink, we sampled the lovely, fresh salad Majorelle which was enough for 2. I also reccomend trying one of the many different teas on offer.All in all a definite must when visiting Marrakech."

The birdsong alone was worth the visit (in March) to this garden of several sectors - notably the tall bamboo garden with many different sorts of bamboo and the cactus garden with all sorts of mature shaped cacti. Superb use of water enhances the garden and creates a great tranquil atmosphere - despite the large number of visitors. The courtyard tearooms are probably the most beautiful I have ever visited, if expensive by local standards."

We spent about an hour or so there, getting there quite early before the crowds.Unfortunately we were disappointed to learn on arrival (March 2010) that the Museum of Islamic Art within the grounds was closed for renovation. There was nothing to indicate this on their website and no indication at the entrance for a reopening date. You don\u2019t need a map, not that there is one, just wander along the paths. It is more of a plant garden than a flower one, but very nice. The cacti were impressive and set off nicely in gravel. Some of the large succulents and bamboo had graffiti on where people had scratched their names, unbelievable that people would do this.There were a couple of particularly good spots for taking photos, by the ponds, and some benches dotted around where you can sit.Wouldn\u2019t think they do much business in the caf\u00e9 as prices were exorbitant, but at least they have the menu with prices displayed outside."

The artist Majorelle designed these beautiful tranquil gardens then they were bought and brought back to life latterly by St Laurent. Cacti, fountains, beautiful tiled walkways and stunningly colouted pots and bamboos. All a haven of peace and style, with the crowning glory, teh stunning blue pavillion (the artist's former studio). Definitely a must see - then worth a revisit and a revisit.... DON'T GO TO MARRAKECH WITHOUT VISITING THIS!!!"

Bring your camera for pics of weirdly shaped cacti, and great portrait shots of your co-traveller. I don't know if we were just lucky on the 40 degree celcius day we were there, but the light was perfect for portrait photography. Picturesque backdrops in all directions - really fab."

Entered from a slightly incongrous alley past some new building development you step through the gate into another world. Entry to gardens only was 30DH/person. The Museum of Islamic Art was closed for renovation when we visited but when it is open you can get a joint ticket for both attractions.It was quite busy with visitors when we went but it still remains calm and quiet. The high growth of much of the plants brings a lovely cool shade around much of the gardens. I'm no botanist and couldn't tell my bougainvilea from my jacaranda (and probably cant spell them either) but so many of the plants are spectacular. I loved the grouping of cacti for example.On a negative note, watch the charges in the cafe. It is a welcome chance to stop for a mint tea as you are not allowed to consume your own picnic. However, 2 juices, a mint tea and a small plate of pastries set us back 250DH, approx \u00a321. A bit steep in my view."

Great way to escape the city, its very peaceful inside and all the water and greenery makes you feel cooler & calmer. There is also a museum of islamic arts (we didnt go in as you had to pay extra), a small boutique and a cafe (not sure how another reviewer missed these?). The cafe makes really nice fruit drinks, although not cheap for Morocco standards.Only down sides were , slightly busy for its size . We seemed to arrive the same time as two coach loads of french tourists. The other is the taxi`s waiting outside asking exuberant prices, our Riad was only a 10 min walk away but due to a sandstorm we wanted a taxi. They were trying to charge us 60 dirham, instead of a normal 10-20 dirham. Managed to find one for 20 in the end."

You can walk around it in about ten minutes and as it's a bit of a hike out of the medina I don't think it's worth the effort. We did use getting there as an excuse to have a trip in a caleche and that was the best bit! It does have some good cacti but other than that it is just tiny lawns you're not allowed to walk on, and practically no flowers. There is nowhere to buy a drink or even any toilets so you can't linger for a few hours even if you wanted to. There were lots of people visiting so it obviously gets good reviews in all the guidebooks but personally, I thought it was disappointing."

The Jardin Majorelle was created by the artist Jacques Majorelle and has a huge cactus collection, as well as various other flowers. The blue villa is a gorgeous building.
