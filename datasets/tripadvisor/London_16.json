Aside from the beautiful architecture inside are the crypts and shores of the Royalty of England dating back 1000, yes 1000, years! Most of the Tutors are buried here as well as many literary and cultural icons. Chaucer, Jane Austen, Shakespeare, Lawrence Olivier and too many more to name. There is an informative free audio tour which you can pick up at the entry, but entry itself is not free (@$20 pp, depending on the exchange rate). Do not miss this if you are visiting London!"

The amount of history crammed into this church is mind-boggling. Of course I knew about the royal weddings but realizing that there is a thousand years worth of history in this beautiful building was mind-blowing! The audio tour was fun to listen to as you walked along and I learned so many facts and tidbits. It made me want to learn a lot more about royal history as well. There was actually a church service going on when we visited which was great to see as well."

The staff then end up being the walk-this-way police, or the photo police, or the move along barkers. To make it worth your 20L go early and avoid some of the hastle."

After arriving from our hotel by tube We caught changing of the Horse Guard at Whitehall 11am then strolled on over with our pre purchased tickets ($11 online) saved us time in the que and nice because they were good for anytime on that day. The interior is spectacular and huge but very manageable due to available helpful staff and very easy to follow audio guides (included with all tours) you use independently. We did not use the personal tours which you can join at specific times. Very cool, one of my favorite London experiences."

We spent hours learning, listening and enjoying the beauty of the Abbey and art and architecture within it's walls. It is a feast for your eyes, seeing the burial crypts of kings and queens, noblemen and holy men as well as artists, poets and scientists. I was humbled to stand in the same space where Kings and Queens worshiped, coronations were held, royal weddings performed and many were laid to rest. It is more magnificent than I ever imagined it to be.Surprising to me was Poet's Corner - where the artists are entombed or honored. Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, and Sir Henry Irving to name a few. Sir Isaac Newton's Grave is huge and a work of art like many of the others. Charles Darwin also rests in the Abbey.The Coronation Chair, made for King Edward I, that is still used, also resides in the Abbey - be sure to see it before you leave."

We wandered aimlessly last time trying to see everything through the crowds of people. We were there at exactly the same time of years as two years ago and yet it was much less crowded. We paid admission of 17 Pounds each and an additional 5 pounds each for a private tour. The private tour was well worth it, so informative and such a great guide. Because we are Canadian and members of the Commonwealth the guide sat us in the chairs reserved for the Canadian High Commisioner in the choir. The building, those buried there, the coronation chair, the stained glass and the history make this an incredible part of your trip to London."

            "review": "Hanging with the \"Royals\". I found myself with nothing to do on a Wednesday afternoon near Parliament Square and decided to visit Westminster Abbey. It normally closes at 3:00 or 3:30 but on Wednesdays its open to 6:00. There was a line which is usual and a certain number of people are allowed in at a time. The price is \"pricey\" @ 20 or 17 for seniors and youth. Children are even less. There is also a group price but group tours are only at certain times. It is well organized and audio tapes are available. It is also an active church so portions were roped off for people praying. It is a spectacular Gothic Church which goes back to 1245 although coronations have been done there since 1000. They have used the same throne since 1308. However most of the church is a cemetery with both aboveground and below ground burials. Henry III is the oldest Royal burial but there is also Edward I, Edward II, Richard II, Henry V, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I [Mary and Elizabeth, enemies in life are buried near each other] and Charles II. English History is everywhere at Westminster Abbey- Charles Darwin, Richard Hakluyt, Robert Adam, Charles Dickens, Samuel Johnson, Benjamin Disraeli; and Geoffrey Chaucer. It might get a little confusing without an audio and people are walking in all different directions. Its a spectacular church with lots of history. If you know British History, its a series a rediscoveries. If you have no interest in history, it might n be worth the 20. Kids may get bored. It can get hot. Gift shop is very nice."

We first went on a Tuesday only to realize the place was not open though the website said it was open. They have a bag search at the entrance and not that they do it thoroughly but if you have lots of stuff in your bag, they make you move them around and take them out of the bag (not so fun with items such as underwear). Although to buy ticket online, you have to purchase it for a certain date and time, it doesn't seem that they really keep track of the number of people inside. when we visited, the place was packed which made moving around, standing and reading stuff a bit difficult.Note: Photography is not permitted inside the abbey."

We had booked prior to our visit and took an audio tour. There is so much information available that the audio guide is a must although parts can be skipped if you wish. We spent around 2 hours visiting which was enough given the crowds and the slow progress.

Would love to visit again and spend longer here, a place not to miss."

Of course, everyone has heard about Poet's Corner and all of the famous people buried here. And the church is gargantuan. But very little effort was put into making it beautiful. There is an exquisite section behind the main alter, which is dedicated to the fallen from the Battle of Britain and it has a gorgeous ceiling, but much of the church is austere. Also, the oldest parts of the building are apparently unstable, and consequently off-limits. So it's worth peeking into, but I wouldn't spend too much time here."

There are other cathedrals to visit if you really want to get a feel for these buildings. That said, there is so much to see inside Westminster that it's easy to be overwhelmed. My reason for visiting was to see \" Edward the Confessor\"'s tomb. I love history and this is an important of English history. Lucky for me there was a world prayer service and was able to go up to see it. Normally it's a closed area and the tomb can't be seen from floor level.Speaking of floor, be careful! Due to it's age, it's very uneven and the crowds are not very friendly. You will get stepped on. Come on American tourists be nicer. This is a site where you take your time not plow through."

The rich history, the burial places competing for space and attention, the remarkable variations in decoration, function and age make Westminster an utterly unique experience. Everyone will find something breath taking and special-relating to a favorite person from history or the arts. Ambling through with the self guided headphones was easy and enjoyable-the snippets of music and detail in the tape quite lively. Note-the cellar cafe at the exit serves excellent lunch, coffee and cakes!"

Seeing the 700+ year old tombs of Kings and queens was awe inspiring. I really don't understand why they have men like Darwin who hated God buried there, but it most likely stems from their shift at some point from the worship of God , to the worship of man. You can see lots of adoration of generals, statesman etc... exhibited within. I still recommend it, though. But I would add we liked St. Paul's much more."

As entrenched as it is in English history, I was more eager to see the resting places and memorial markers to my favorite English authors. Jane Austin is not buried there, but there is a plaque for her. Charles Darwin is there as well as Issac Newton, (for you DaVinci Code fans). Then there were the kings and queens, famous and infamous throughout history. I love places like this. When you actually see the places or the tombs of those people you read about in history class, it makes it suddenly \"real\". I particularly enjoyed seeing Queen Elizabeth I's tomb. \"Gloriana\" herself! I was amused to learn that her older sister Queen Mary is buried immediately below here. As they fought so much during their lives, they are spending eternity together. The Abbey is a must, but it is about 20 pounds sterling entry fee. (It depends on the daily exchange rate, but I believed this would have been $25 or $26 US dollars) I had been doing research prior to the trip and knew that admission to London museums is free, (well, they do ask for good will donations). It is definitely worth it. They have guided tours but they also have the audio, self-guided. As th is is an active place of worship, access is affected by services. There are also hourly prayers offered by the clergy."

Were you to walk through it's splendidness unaccompanied it would be a wondrous place. Sadly for the individual tourist, that will never be the case. It gets busy, very busy. There are a lot of tourists in there. Tourists however are not the main problem. The main problem is the ubiquitousness of those blasted audio tour devices. Whatever happened to the good old days when if you wanted an audio tour you used headphones? Sure, it looked strange seeing hoards and hoards of people engrossed in headphones as opposed to looking around, but at least there was still silence. Now if you chose not to listen to the audio tour yourself all you can hear are almost silent snatches of words in a variety of languages. I imagine that's probably what purgatory is like; constantly roaming Westminster Abbey whilst listening to a Jeremy Irons tour on repeat.Ranting aside it is a beautiful place and well worth a (costly) visit. If you'd rather explore the abbey using your own senses I suggest taking earplugs."

They provide an excellent audio guide but I would suggest trying to get into one of the daily tours offered by the Warders - 5 or 6 pounds but well worth it. I would also highly recommend, even if you are not religiously inclined, to line up at the west gate around 4:15 to get into Evensong.

When I visited Westminster Abbey I had a rudimentary knowledge of history and some famous historical figures. I never knew what it would really feel like to step over Sir Issac Newtons Grave, but I know now. I had imagined what the king's coronation chair looked like, but was I surprised, and wrong! I had not a clue about the damage done to this and other historical buildings during war bombings. But one afternoon in this beautiful Abbey and I was left with lasting impressions and memories for a lifetime. I literally stepped over Sir Issac Newton's grave, which was in the floor inside the abbey. At first I was in disbelief, and thought it rather improper to step across it, but it was part of the floor. Realizing everyone else was walking on it, I felt a great desire surge inside and I did step across the grave of the man who brought such change and insight to our lives. I won't give away the story of the coronation chair as I think it is better learned in person. The abbey is beautiful, old, royal and like none other . I would return to Westminster Abbey in a moment if I were able, and I hope someday to take my daughter there. It is full of educational opportunities, history and 'awe' for anyone. I recommend to everyone a visit to Westminster Abbey. It is worth the time and cost tenfold."

It was one of her choice of \"places to see\" during her stay in UK. We paid \u00a354 (1 adult, 1 over 60, 1 student) which is not cheap despite I know that keeping running such building must be expensive, and waited in a slowly moving row for about 45 mins. Inside we got audio tour guide which was excellent, very clear and understandable. But due to HUGE amount of visitors you don't have feeling of fully enjoying the place. It's incredibly interesting, every corner, every place is connected with the history, sometimes I felt like \"pushed\" going forward with the crowd. I think it would be better to sell certain amount of tickets for certain hours ( also online which you cannot do now) that everybody could enjoy visit here."

Also the numerous staff/wardens located around the building who were friendly and approachable, very knowledgable and obviously enthusiastic about the building.Although my husband and I were there for about 2 hours and saw so many amazing things when we read the book we brought home with us we realised how many other bits we had missed.

The wait was well worth it. Early birds in line for this service (which is not a full mass but prayer highlighted by much choir singing) have a great advantage: only a few (on our evening, less than 20) get admitted to the quire, which is the tiered bench seating facing either side of the aisle, and is where the choir sits. Later admits sit in folding chairs on the right angle sides (transepts?) to the aisle and only the first row or 2 there can even see the choir or the other participants; the rest have to watch the service on a tv monitor. You still get the awesome acoustical experience of the choir in that great cathedral but it's not the same."

The church is closed to tourists and they vigorously keep them out so after the device, those attending were escorted out. They also have a no photography policy that they enforce as we saw several people sneaking iPhone photos that were asked to stop. We did not return on a normal visiting day as we did not want to fifth the crowds (which were big) so can't really comment on the historical aspect other than to say that it was meaningful to be in the same place where royal weddings and coronations have occurred."

We arrived about 10 minutes after opening and got in straight away. Once inside, you can go as fast or slow as you wish, you can elect to read everything, or listen to your audio guide about select things, depending on your time constraints. Unfortunately you are not able to take any photos within the Abbey itself, and there are very serious watchers to ensure that you comply. Lens caps have to be on all cameras, and no mobile phones are allowed out. The various influences on the architecture inside and the various plaques, memorials etc, the age of some of the pieces, it is all quite extraordinary and remarkable. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We were there when the gardens and cloisters were opened as well, and enjoyed these as well, and you were able to take photos here. After our visit we enjoyed a snack at the Cellarium.

The website allowed me to select a same day booking but when I got there I was told it was too late in the afternoon to enter (around 1pm on a Saturday). Many, many other people had this same problem that were standing around the entrance with me, and we were being rudely told basically too bad and come back Monday. Well, many of us were not in town that long so basically just made a donation to the Abbey that we do not feel good about. I highly recommend they offer a refund (I also emailed and asked for this and was told again, too bad, non refundable). I would have probably said yes if they had kindly asked to make the fee a donation. but now am just annoyed. I've recommended the website block reservations if dates are not accurate (vs just processing them with the next available date-by then it's too late). No reply."

Immediately upon entering the Abbey ask any employee where to sign up for the Verger Tours, Tour sizes are limited to ten to twelve people and you are allowed to visit portions of the Abbey where other visitors are not allowed to go.

I would say we waited for 5 minutes max before going in. We also arrived around a half hour after it opened, timing it just right to avoid the tour groups that were also organizing to go in.For kids, the audio guide is pretty boring but the staff have a treasure clue hunt with questions regarding the historical tombs and monuments, which my little cousins really enjoyed. At the end, they get a chocolate gold coin, which they all loved. I'd also recommend going on a day where the rest of the areas are also open because those extra gardens and spaces were really beautiful!Overall, good place to absorb some history but it could be boring for the little ones."

I had heard through friends that he gave an amazing tour of the Abbey (tours take place regularly throughout the day and are 5\u00a3 in addition to the price of admission), and we were not disappointed! Benjamin made the Abbey come alive for us during his 90-minute tour. You can ask if he is working when you sign up for your tour (at the Abbey entrance after you have purchased your admission ticket), and request his tour time. A truly memorable experience!"

Great view of history because of the graves, the architecture and memorials. From Issac Newton to Chaucer, the graves of Queen Elizabeth the 1st, and her sister Mary. Really worth the entry fee. The architecture and history of its expansion are really impressive."

We had the London Pass so it was included in that. Well worth every cent. Queen Elizabeth 1 is buried here along with her sister Queen Mary, and Mary Queen Scots is also buried here too. If you are isiting London this is amust, also the Houses of Parliment are just across the road,so make sure you get your tickets for that as well and do them at same time."

I had only coffee & ' Victorian Sponge' Just 2 hefty slabs of what is really only a 'VictorianSandwich'( a type of butter cake) & only made edible with lots of jam & cream filling.

Within its walls, memorials, shrines, tombs and statues of seventeen monarchs and 3,300 British notables vie with one another for space. At times, it seems a jumble that detracts from seeing the actual interior. It is not the most beautiful religious edifice, but it most certainly is a monument to the nation's rich and bloody history.My favorite area was the Lady's Chapel with its richly fan-vaulted ceiling. Magnificently carved mahogany stalls contrast with the light-colored stone walls and ceiling of this chapel. These stalls were used by the Knights of the Order of the Bath and are adorned with the crest, coat of arms and heraldic banner of each knight.Audio guides are a must during the visit as it is sometimes difficult to figure out where you are as you snake your way around the abbey. My spouse and I spent three hours since you can walk at your own pace without being hurried and shuffled from place to place. We especially enjoyed hunting down the tombs of the more famous such as Darwin and Newton, along with the notables buried in the Poet's Corner.We also enjoyed seeing the cloister and garth, so don't leave without a visit.The Chapter House was closed to the public at the time, which was a disappointment.We arrived in the morning on May 09, found a long line had already formed, and expected an excruciating wait. But the line moved at a fast pace. The senior rate was 17 pounds each, and we were able to use our credit card. It was more than we paid for any other church or cathedral during our two-week tour of Great Britain. But then, one rarely has the opportunity to walk through Time's Attic."

The architecture is amazing and steeped in so much history. There are kings and queens, poets and many more historical people buried here. You get an hand held audio machine telling you little stories about areas within the abbey or you could have a guided tour. We choose for the audio machine. Unfortunately, the Museum was closed on the day we went, but I believe that is really good too. There is a coffee shop, toilets and a souvenir shop inside the Abbey. Not sure it is suitable for wheelchairs as there are a few tight places. Overall, a lovely, interesting abbey,"

Seeing all the graves of historic figures was hard to wrap my head around that they were actually buried there or had been there. You get a free audio guide at the beginning which I found really helpful. Since there are a lot of people in there, it was nice being able to listen to the guide when you couldn't get near enough to read the signs. The guides also come in many languages. We went for opening which I would highly recommend. It gets busy very quickly so it was nice being there early. We also had the london pass so we had a bit of a fast pass in. I would also recommend giving yourself at least 2 hours to do it if not more. There is so much to see and read."

I know Westminster Abbey rather well, having been to a local school that was serviced by the Abbey and hence my children and I chose not to use the free audio guide. Despite this a few minutes after entering the abbey a verger comes up to us telling us to use an audio guide, despite my saying we'd prefer not to his response of \"well, really!\" was rude aggressive and unwarranted. Visually the place is crowded and not just with shrines, plaques and graves. The information leaflet and signage is poor and visitors seem to dump their litter is all sorts of peculiar nooks and crannies. We were herded around a set walking route, fair enough, but then we see another verger tap dancing in the nave and discussing loudly whether there was anything under the flagstones with his colleagues before dancing again. Most extra-ordinary is a doorway tucked away labelled Britain's oldest door........ no evidence, no background nothing surely Britain's oldest \"known\" door........... You are also not able to see Edward the Confessor's Shrine - not acceptable for such a huge entrance fee - I am hardly likely to attend a service at 8am in the morning on a Tuesday to see it - we get it's old, fragile etc but sort something - even if it's only a visual by a video link. There's also no point signing medieval floor tiles when they're covered by line.......... surely some of them could be covered with acrylic? All in all underwhelming given the extensive history of the building, the staff need a lesson in manners and the place needs to decide whether it is a church and or a museum as at the moment the balance is simply not right."

So many Kings, Queens and other persons (don't want to spoil it, but absolutely loved Poets Corner).We just missed the 11am tour (maximum of 20 people) and included in the entry price was the audio system, which we were very impressed with, not too deep with just enough information. Many parts of the abbey are tight and the audio reminds you at this stage to assist by not lingering too long. All persons did exactly as they were asked and there are several times you can just sit and look around you, its amazing how much more you can see from floor to roof. Toilets well placed towards the end (and clean) of your visit and 2 shops with the usual fare plus some extras, my wife chose Christmas Tree decorations (as you do). I never saw a single flash from a camera and people seemd to be extremely well behaved. If in London I would recommend you visit. There is a caf\u00e9 near the exit but we did not visit"

It is important to remember when entering Westminster Abbey that it an active Anglican church with members and services like any other church. As such, it is also subject to closure to tourists during those services. We ran into that, but were still able to tour the abbey quite nicely in the late afternoon (just rearranged the plans for the day). So much of England's history -- it's kings and queens, statesmen, artists, and poets -- are in that one place. It is truly awesome (in the correct sense)."

But our kids felt like they saw enough while sitting for the concert. I think concerts are on Sunday's, late afternoons. The cathedral is quite beautiful. But the organ concert made it come alive.

I highly recommend arriving early in the day as the crowds do swell as the day goes on. A heads up that there are two entrance lines, the one found on the right hand side as you face the door is for those with the London Pass while the line on the left is for those buying tickets. Another visitor explained a staff person had come out shortly before we arrived and told them where to stand. I am glad they did as the London pass line up was significantly longer and we were buying our tickets (using the National Rail 2for1 vouchers). There was no signage explaining this at first so that was a little confusing. In fact, the signage did not go out until about 5 minutes before they opened. If you plan on taking the free audio guide tour, I recommend downloading the audio guide app on your phone before arriving. It is very user friendly and interesting. I actually listened to part of it while waiting in line to get in. You cannot take pictures inside which I understand, but would have still loved to do given the beauty and grandeur of it all. We did not take the paid tour, but did hear snippets from tour guides as they passed by and it sounded very good. I was the only one that really wanted to visit Westminster Abbey while in London so my family went there mainly because they knew it was important to me. In the end, my husband and three teenagers all found things they appreciated there as well. We spent just over two hours there including a short visit to the gift shop. I probably could have stayed a little longer, but I could tell my kids had their fill by then and it was also starting to get much more crowded. It was well worth the admission cost and it is one of my favorite destinations while in London."

We have done similar quizzes elsewhere where the kids have been able to better engage.

Westminster Abbey was one of my top two favorite attractions I visited during my two-week trip to England and my favorite in London. Not only is the interior beautiful from an architectural standpoint, but the extent of British history throughout the centuries that is virtually at your fingertips is mind-boggling. The final resting places of kings, queens, famous figures (for example, Charles Darwin) are all in this location. The coffins for royalty are pieces precious metal work and decorative art; I was numbed by the sheer number. Not free nor inexpensive, nor discounted with the London Pass, but well worth the visit, and recommend a second visit to fully absorb the sheer quantity of historical items. I add that it was quite crowded during my visit, which is not surprising, so prepare to blot out some of the background pandemonium and crowd effect to fully enjoy the experience."

The 10th Century Abbey is actually worth the (very high!) price. It is more than a monument, a royal burial place, home to coronations and royal weddings. Westminster Abbey is a sanctuary of faith as much as it a sanctuary of architecture and history. I asked one of the staff how long a visit would take and they said 1.5 hours. I left 2.5 hours later and I felt I would love to have had a longer detailed guided tour. Definitely worth visit at least once!"

We found many places in London do not allow pictures. So be sure to take ur mental pictures. It was very impressive though and to consider the history and how many royals have been crowned there. Many tombs of royals and important people through history like Darwin and Newton. The chair where the king or queen is crowned is the last thing you will see before u exit the church and it was incredibly impressive. It is behind glass, for obvious reasons. Well worth the experience and right across is Parliament and Big Ben."

This is a must see for every first timer, or even if you've seen it before!"

Otherwise considering that most attractions open at 10 Am and close by 5pm. it is very difficult to plan your day due to the crowd.But, this place is worth it. Be early and spend time here. One thing to note is that Westminister Abbey is closed on SUNDAYs. SO NEVER PLAN YOUR TRIP to this place on sunday."

Again, even if you're not a religious person, is worth it! The Abbey closes, and they only let the people that want to participate enter. In other words, you have the Abbey just for yourself and some other few people for an hour! When I went, we sat at the middle of the nave and there was a choir singing for the mass. I had one hour to sit there and enjoy every single part of the paintings and structure and ornaments as the choir sang! Now, I don't know if the choir participates on every mass, so I suggest to ask or to visit the website before you go!"

Based on genealogical research, it appears that I found an ancestor, and the staff let me take a photo of his burial with SPECIAL PERMISSION. You must see Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Mary, the Coronation Chair (minus Stone of Scone now), and many other famous monarchs. Also, the 1000 year old stone sarcophagi of Abbots line some of the lesser populated areas but they really touched me. Note: It is very crowded so be aware.

I suggest googling the long list of people buried in Westminster Abbey but the standouts for us were Darwin, Sir Issac Newton and countless poets and writers. The downside of the visit was the mass hordes of people. We arrived 30 minutes before opening with a London Pass and the line up was already long. Once the doors opened the people are funneled through the Abbey in a slow moving horde. It was very difficult to go back if you missed something because you are trying to move against the swarm of people and many areas are very narrow. It made me think what would the Da Vinci Code be like if Robert Langdon came in with the crowds and was packed shoulder to shoulder in front of Newton's tomb. I really loved the Abbey and would like to come back in an off season time and have time to peacefully explore Abbey at our own pace.

Some bits are two long for the space you have to look around by generally good and Jeremy Ions does the commentary. The musical options are also nice as it adds to the atmosphere in the abbey. Let downs - no photography. This isn't the same across the country in these large churches so that was disappointing. No reason for this to be honest. It works in St Pauls Basilica so not sure why it can't work here. Also, women's toilets - there were huge queues. Needs to be many more."

As a building it speaks of 1,000 years of English and then British history; as a place of worship it can be sublime. But when attending evensong the vergers ensure that one isn't actually viewing the building without paying by ushering one in and out along strictly designated routes.Evensong is a wonderful - and particularly Anglican - service. I have managed to attend evensong in a significant number of English cathedrals, but have to say that a winter evening in Durham, or a quiet service in Manchester or Birmingham, can be more moving than in some of the 'statement' places of worship, where it is obvious that many in the congregation aren't actually there for the service.When the regular choir is away, in the summer and after Christmas, all sorts of visiting choirs appear; on this occasion services were being sung for a week by the choir of Trinity Church, Boston, MA. (This isn't the church used for the 'one lamp or two' signal at the beginning of the Revolutionary War, it would have been a delicious irony if it had been).Some Episcopalian choirs in the US are quite excellent: St Thomas, Fifth Avenue being a good example. But if a large American choir gives it their all, as in this case, some of the subtleties of the acoustics, and the music, can be lost. Or maybe Stanford and Howells don't really suit this choir. But it was still well worth attending this service."

To suddenly see everyone, of all nationalities, stop and be still was inspiring to say the least. There was history at every turn, though you had to jostle a bit to get close to it.

The architecture in itself is astonishing so anyone without any historical background of the place or royals buried there can spend hours marveling at it. Once you have the chance to catch up on the historical aspect through the concise,beautifully-delivered comments and movies on the audio guides included in the price of the tour, you find yourself lost in time. Make sure you go there early in the day, since you might find yourself being quite hurried on if it is close to the time that the choir starts practicing for the day's mass. And yes, the price is quite steep, but I found it worth every penny. Now going with children(8&12 in my case) is a bit tricky. For an adult this can be enjoyable and interesting for many hours on end, but the kids were fed up after one hour. A run through would've sufficed for them. They're too young to appreciate history, art or architecture, so if you're planning a long visit here, you might want to reconsider. They even got a kids' course map and pencil to count lions, find other animals and answer history questions with the promise of a big commemorative chocolate coin at the end. They only managed to fill less than a quarter of their \"assignment \" but we're thrilled to still get a chocolate coin at the end. Our visit left sweet impressions on them too:) The gift shop is one of the best gift shops a church would offer and the prices are not exaggerated. I personally hope I'll get another chance to visit on my own someday so that I can lose myself in all that splendor for hours and hours."

The line moved fairly quickly for us as we had a London Pass. We recommend buying a London Pass if going to more of these popular attractions. When you first walk in you are in awe of the church. There are burial plots dedicated to famous Brits and British elites. There is a remarkable feeling of piece as you walk through. The entirety is a work of art with amazing sculptures, stained glass, carvings, and metal work. The church is also quite large. There is the main bit where most of the famous gravesite are, but more of the church describes its complex history and changing perception in London. Walking through it we ended up exiting at a different entrance and were able to see it from a different angle.

There is a free audio guide that you can download on iTunes so you dont have to use the ones there. Take headphones.

We arrived just in time for a summer Wednesday evening organ concert (which is a usual scheduled event) so the ambiance was awesome. In the abbey there are monuments to those buried here but also commemorative plaques for prominent (or wealthy) citizenry. My favorite spot was poets corner. Make sure you stop here to appreciate the markers for the writers of our civilization. Oh! I don't think the audio helped too much. I listened to about 5-6 sound stops.

The audio guide, narrated by Jeremy Irons, is mandatory.Also, in addition to major religious figures and monarchs, the abbey also pay homage (and houses the remains) of notorious englishmen and women, like Darwin, Lord Byron, Isaac Newton, etc. I think this is a must do for London."

The abbey is a living cemetery with so many famous people buried in this abbey. The flow of the tour is very well laid out to keep the tourists moving through the various sites.

The history of the building is remarkable. The architecture is superb. Wandering through the various alcoves with their distinctive themes and dedications is a treasure. And it certainly develops a sense of respect and awe in one as you contemplate the various persons buried there whose lives were instrumental in western civilization."

This was a spur of the moment tour as our prior tour ended in Westminster Square. The kids took off to other parts and I did a self tour alone.This was awe inspiring and words cannot describe the depth of the beauty of the architecture and craftsmanship. The moment you enter, your breath is taken away. I was given a recorded tour and it flowed smoothly. I was flabbergasted to find how many crypts and tombs are in the Abbey. You are literally walking on someone's grave at almost every step. If you time it correctly, you can attend a mass. I was able to sit in a mass as well as light a candle. As with most churches and holy places in Europe, photos of the interior are prohibited. However, there are several hallways outside that have beautiful stained glass and architecture you can capture.Photos and videos of royal weddings do not capture a fraction of the amazement and grandeur of this church. It is rich with history of England. You must see it in person. I would visit it a second time on my next visit."

We went in the afternoon on a Monday in August and waited about 45 minutes to get in; the pass line moved very quickly and the wait was probably five minutes. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are many luminaries, all the way from Edward the Confessor forward, who are buried here. The audio tour comes with the price of admission, and is very informative and of an appropriate length; plan for about 90 minutes. There are prayers every hour on the hour, and a service at 3 pm every day. This is right next to the houses of parliament and Big Ben, about a 10 minute walk from Buckingham Palace."

We did have a look at this majestic Abby from the outside and I feel that's it is one of the most beautiful building I saw in London and its a credit to the British Royal families and government to open it to the public for tours (even though the price is 20 pounds) though saying that it probably goes to the up keep of the building and that's well worth it. Looking around outside it wasn't as big as I thought that it would be and was really surprised - guess that the only time I have seen the exterior and grounds has been a televised royal wedding and the exterior was crowded. Its a really beautiful building/church and hope they continue to keep it in such good conditionI would suggest that if you do intend to go here try and find a tour company that has skip-the-line tickets and that will save you a great deal of time.

The histories of Westminster Abbey and England are almost the same as the Abbey was built in 1065 (the remains of 29 kings and queens, hundreds of memorials to poets, politicians, scientists lie under its stones). The best way to see and understand the vast history of this place is to pay the entrance fee that includes audioguide, cloisters and Abbey Museum. To avoid the steep entrance price you can attend 5:00PM evensong, but no pictures are allowed and make sure you like the 45 minutes of singing version of the evening prayer in the Anglican Church:))"

I would advise getting here early, the queues get quiet long. I wouldn't prebook as the queue to pick up the tickets was just as big. The abbey itself is gorgeous and breath taking, but the huge amount of history you are able to witness inside is amazing. The guides/staff are fantastic, so knowledgeable, don't miss out by not asking them."

The architecture is spectacular and the place is filled with history and famous literature persons. Suitable for all ages as they also offer a children's self-guided tour/treasure hunt to keep the little ones entertained whilst you look around.Definitely pick up an audio guide, they are free and the Abbey does not have many info signs to explain the different areas. Some areas are only able to be seen on group tours that you pay extra for, so if you really want to see it thoroughly this may be worth it for you, although there are grainy videos of the areas on the audio guides to make up for this.Do make sure to visit the gardens on a nice day, they are open on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays and are pretty (a nice place for a picnic).. The abbey does offer a 2For1 rail ticket deal outside of peak seasons (20th July-5th September I think) so try and visit outside of this time to save money (See national rail website for more details). Otherwise entry is \u00a320 for an adult.The staff were really helpful and friendly, they answered my questions happily.We spent about 2 hours there, listening to the whole audio tour.If you are short for time or money, then the Abbey is a bit like a larger version of St Paul's so I recommend visiting one or the other if this is the case.From memory St Paul's seemed more wheelchair accessible than the Abbey, which contained steps into many of the chapels (however the abbey do offer a video so that you do not have to miss out on seeing parts of the abbey, though these aren't great quality)."

It helps a lot if you read up on English history and read a book about the Abbey before visiting -- know something about what you are seeing! Your visit will be greatly enhanced. If you're a Christian from a denomination that values the liturgy (Catholic, Anglican, Episcopalian, Lutheran, etc.) try to attend a church service there. Most inspiring! The only negative comment I can make about the place is that it is usually crowded, so take your time and don't let yourself get pushed along by the crowd. Also there are frequently noisy groups of schoolchildren - always French in my experience, but there are certainly others from elsewhere too -- who will run you over as they move quickly from one thing to another."

I'll be honest, I didn't want to go to London that much but my husband convinced me. I wasn't sold on anything and basically took advice on what \"I HAD to see\". Usually I'm overly prepared for trips but not this one. Westminster was worth it, just like everyone said. I can't believe how beautiful it is and all the history there. We had the London Pass so it was free entrance and audio guide. That is what we used and my husband and I took turns taking care of the stroller and baby while the other went to see the smaller areas of the church. There is just so much! You can go back every time you visit and I swear there will be more to hear. Cons: Since we did the audio guide only that's the only thing I can really comment on. It's kind of confusing starting out, you are sure if you need to stay in the initial atrium and listen to it, or if you can walk through the first hallway to get to the first station (you do). The audio guide doesn't really talk about any specific entombments at first, so even though you'll see Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton, they aren't really discussed except in passing. But stations 1-4 are excellent, lots of information (though I think they probably glazed over a lot). Things start to get very crowded after this and it's not clearly labeled (or at least I had trouble finding the stations on my own) stations 5 & 6 are good but especially 7-9, 15 & 16 are hard to find and a pain in the butt to figure out who they talking about. It's all incredibly fascinating but you can lose your baring if you're not careful.Also, I wish they would do more in the audio guide about the beginning of the church, most of it was focused on the Monarchs who had contributed to building it up but very little is said about the time it was a monastery. I did pay for the Souvenir Guide so now that I am at home I can do some further reading, but I kept hoping there would be more about that during the audio tour. Pros: Just when you think you're getting lost, you climb the stairs to Henry VII's Lady Chapel. This is, in my opinion, the best part of the entire tour. There is so much in this section of the church and as a personal Philippa Gregory fan this is the part that probably would be most interesting to younger female history fans. Make sure to see the Cloister Garth, it reminds me of Hogwarts and there are some really beautiful memorials in there. Family Tip: If you have a child young enough, I highly recommend forgoing the stroller and wearing your baby if you can. There is surprisingly a lot of London that is accommodating to strollers and while you can bring in your stroller into Westminster, take it from me, it is much much easier to wear your baby through this particular attraction."

For this reason the audio guide is a must. There is little to no signs indicating whose tomb is whose and since the majority of inscriptions are in Latin, most people will be out of luck without the guide. The building is quite crowded even early in the day so it does require a bit of patience if you are going like did in the summer months and it would not be a good visit for anyone hoping to run in and out.

I have never entered, so I cannot comment on the interior.Westminster Abbey (which is not an abbey anymore) is famous because of its significance in coronation and burial site (for royal and other significant people, such as Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin), but the building exterior itself is typical gothic that you can find anywhere else. Beautiful, but not unique in itself."

I have seen dozens of the greatest churches from throughout the world and while it is not number 1 number 2 or number 3 it must be in the top 10. Beyond the basic architecture what is truly impressive is the history of the building instructed over so many centuries. For the beyond that people buried in the building and the nature of their tombs. The most interesting and possibly most impressive of which being poets corner. It is definitely a must-see. I wish there have been some way to get past the long lines but it was well worth it"

I waited and watched the queue of people stream past. The security guy asked me what I was after and I explained his colleague told me to wait there. After a quick search of my bag, he let me in and I joined the queue with the others. Not quite sure why I couldn't have just joined the main queue outside as it made little difference. Once inside, we were given our wrist bands and free audio guide (I downloaded the app beforehand but didn't want to use up my battery!) and off we went. You know, I've wanted to go inside here for years, ever since I was a little girl and it was more than I could have imagined. The place is beautiful and bursting with history. You can read what you'll see here on the official website so I'll spare you the details. You're guided around (a bit like sheep) thanks to the audio guide so you're all pretty much going in the same direction. It's a lot smaller than I imagined so plenty of, \"Excuse me please\" was going on - so many people just stand there having conversations without a thought for the people behind waiting for a glimpse of Elizabeth I's resting place. I was there for a couple of hours but would have happily spent another two hours going around again."

Get the audio guide to Westminster. It is well narrated by Jeremy Irons and helps guide you along the best route to see the most of the abbey. Photography didn't seem to be allowed in the main part of the church but I saw people taking pictures with their phones- however, I feel like soaking it in and just absorbing the magnitude of the entire place is a better use of time than trying to photograph something you really aren't supposed to. Outside the main cathedral, photography is allowed so go to town out there. In a nutshell, give yourself plenty of time to experience this amazing site, get the audio guide, and set down the cell phone."

I would allow at least two hours to experience the Abbey, and keep in mind that no photography is allowed inside the church, but it is permitted in the cloisters.Also, make sure you check out the downstairs room in the gift shop!

We very much enjoyed this service which was only slightly spoiled by the tourists who came in and left after 15 minutes, interrupting the service by the noise they made in leaving. We enjoyed the music and singing so much, it contributed to us going to evensong at York Minster a couple of weeks later. The disadvantage of not paying to get in earlier was that you are very restricted in what you can see at evensong and exploration of the Abbey during tour hours is strongly recommended.

These were the movers and shakers of their day that shaped the course of human events right up to today. We are all living the results of their actions and can learn a great deal from their triumphs and mistakes. Plan to spend some time here and coordinate your visit with Parliament (reservations needed) across the street. Try to get a guided tour of the Abbey (Check with local tour groups as this is a very crowded site) and then walk around to find significant figures from the past on your own. Handicap accessible but limited access to nooks along the walls in places. A great place for older children who have studied some of these figures but be respectful as it is an active religious facility."

We toured the Abbey and then enjoyed a delicious meal in their Cellarium Cafe, while waiting for the Evensong, an awesome musical presentation by their choir and some Scripture reading. We we near the front of the line which allowed us front row seats to not only hear the choir but to actually see them sing. Such a special treat for all of us. No photography is allowed inside but the outside of the building makes for some amazing photos.

I knew I wanted to go in there, so on one of our free days, I went by myself. Well worth the 20 pounds to get in. I ate on the Abby Grass, and then took a 2 hour stroll. I couldn't believe how many royalty are buried there, along with so many important people...Charles Dickens, Sir Isaac Newton, Sir Lawrence Olivia, and ironically, Charles Darwin. Sarcophagus's are everywhere. I am amazed anyone would get married with it all around them. I found it so surprising that in the middle of the Abby, is the organ loft and choir area. I have never noticed it during Kate and Will's wedding. I asked if it moves and they said no. In fact, if you are in the back half of the abby, there is no way to see the wedding or coronations, so they have to have televisions up to see them. That really surprised me. It is an absolute fascinating place to see."

You could probably spend a whole day inside if you like history. I would still say that 20 pounds is a rip-off though. But the pricey museum tickets are a well known aspect of tourism in London. If you don't have 20 pounds to spare on this visit, I'd advise other activities which you could do for free \u263a"

We arrived in time to do the 11am Verger tour and Andrew our tour guide was fantastic and it was well worth the extra money to do it as you get to go inside the shrine of St. Edward the confessor. This was a particular highlight for me as this also houses the tomb of Henry V and all you see from outside the shrine are his feet. Others highlights included the Coronation Chair, the Tomb of the Unknown warrior and the plaque marking Anne Neville (Richard III's Wife). I really wanted to see this as I had seen Richard III at Bosworth field before they took him the Leicester.We had lunch in the caf\u00e9, while a bit pricey and slow service it was extremely good and there were not many people.It is one thing to see the Abbey on TV, but it is a whole different experience to actually be there in person and soak up the atmosphere and the history. While on the Tour Andrew told us not to worry about walking over anyone buried in the floor as there were over 3000 people in the floor. The only one which is never walked over is the Unknown Warrior as a mark of respect.I can't wait to go back!"

The highlight is really the exterior the interior is really a graveyard of rich people, politicians and former royalty the church or Abbey is not comparable to others in Europe or locally St. Paul's. It's divided into smaller chapels and and lacks the great expanse of churches like St.Pauls (where Charles and Diana were married). We made the mistake of trying to enter the wrong entrance (where others were being admitted) and encountered a very unpleasant female employee. For anyone who likes to actually take a picture, forget about it here, my daughter went to take one picture and had this crazed deacon screaming at her. Definitely not a good experience and certainly our experience did nothing other than reflect poorly on the Christian faith. Restrooms were disgusting."

Thousands of people are buried or have their ashes interred here, including kings, queens, statesmen, soldiers, poets, priests, heroes and villains. Some interesting facts: the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held here in 1997, the wedding of Prince William and Kate took place here in 2011, Queen Elizabeth II was crowned on King Edward\u2019s Chair, along with every monarch since 1308.

Even if you're not overly religious, the historical significance of Westminster Abbey is worth the trip - please make sure you're respectful of their \"house rules\" though (e.g. silence when the group prayer is conducted each hour, no photos inside the Abbey, not touching artifacts which are marked accordingly etc). I tried to visit the Abbey a couple of weeks ago, but it was closed to sightseers unexpectedly (it is primarily a place of worship after all), so I recommend checking their website before you go to check their opening hours. A word to the wise: skip the queue by purchasing your ticket online - you bypass all queues and go straight through the rope barrier. There are no photos allowed inside the Abbey, so make use of the exterior and the Cloisters for photo opportunities. You can also purchase guidebooks or download professional photos for free from the WA website. I highly recommend paying the extra \u00a35 to attend one of the Verger tours - their insights on the history of the Abbey, the events which take place here, and the artifacts inside are fascinating. Well worth a visit!"

            "review": "A Must See in London. A tour of Westminster Abbey is certainly at the top of the list for sightseeing in London. The history contained within its walls is incredible, including the final resting places of a number of Kings and Queens of England.Entrance to the Abbey is not cheap - for the 5 of us, it came to over $100 dollars US. This did include a handheld electronic device that provided a guided tour. I had wanted to see the tomb of King (Saint) Edward the Confessor, but this was blocked off from foot traffic because of its age. You could peek in to the area and see the resting place of the king who had built the Abbey. This was one of the only sights that I did not purchase tickets for in advance and it was no problem. The line was not long and moved very quickly. If you are going to visit other churches, such as St. Paul's, you may want to consider going online and buying a pass that includes entry to all of them. But, since we were not going elsewhere this worked out just fine.It took us about an hour to go all around, including reading the markers and listening to the guided tour. I'm sure that it may take others longer, depending on how much you want to study and observe. It seemed like one hour was sufficient to see most things and still not be rushed. There is a nice garden off to the side and you can sit for a little while and enjoy the peace and tranquility. There is also a nice, albeit small, gift shop at the end of the tour where you can find books on English history and other assorted mementos. All in all, a very enjoyable stop."

Now, you're no longer allowed to take photographs; and it seems a lot of the abbey is roped off and inaccessible, and what bit you can look round is so cramped & packed with everyone else who's visiting that you don't get the opportunity to really stop & look at anything.I understand that with the amount of visitors they must get each day, they have to get people round as quickly & organised as possible, but it did take some of the enjoyment out of it. We travelled to London with National Express so were able to take advantage of their 2 for 1 offer - if we'd had to pay the full \u00a340 for the 2 of us, I'd have been pretty miffed.That said, the staff were really nice, especially the security guards."

Amazing number of recognisable names on the many tombstones underfoot. On site guides were patient and informative. There are toilets available and a tea room. The shop sells the usual souvenirs but also has a more upmarket and tasteful section with a lovely selection of jewellery, scarves and religious ornaments. Well worth a visit as you really get a sense of connecting with history."

We had the audio set which was most helpful and gave us very good information as we moved along. It was also great reading and hearing of historical people buried underfoot and in the walls of the abbey. I was pleased that we could really visit the whole part of the abbey and on departing the Abbey we could see the Coronation chair which has been used for all the Coronations. It looks a bit worn but the History of it is amazing. There is a shop onsite if you require souvenirs"

Despite the fact there were hundreds and hundreds of people around me I found the Abbey to be a peaceful and spiritual place. I bought a guide and would recommend it to those interested in knowing what they're looking at. I spoke to a couple of members of staff and they were keen to answer my questions and happy to chat which made me feel very welcome. Parts of the Abbey made me emotional but I always found space to take a minute of contemplation when I needed it. As a recreational historian I enjoyed feeling the weight of history around me. It was also a nice surprise to stumble upon the oldest door in Britain, I wasn't excepting that and it was fun to know even an incredibly popular, well known and famous place like Westminster Abbey can hold unexpected surprises and secrets. Just a tiny complaint, the toilets were horrendous, dirty and no toilet paper, but the Abbey was so wonderful it didn't matter to me and I'm still giving my visit 5 stars."

Tickets for this event are available by written application to the Australian High Commission in London, apply online.Being present for this event on such a historical day and in a historical building was a day we will not forget, the sounds of the organ and choir singing, the military bugles resonating through the Abbey, the procession of royalty, religious clergy and other dignitaries, a time honoured tradition is etched in my mind. The ANZAC Day service was incredibly moving, Westminster Abbey was a gracious host."

There's no rush on the tour although in places, such as in the side chapels, you need to keep moving as the entrances and exits are narrow and single file. There is no photography allowed until you exit and head to the cloisters. It's food for thought as you try to piece together the timeline and places in history of the people who lay at rest here. At 12.30pm each day there is a short service that everyone is welcome to attend. The cloisters and chapter house complete a superb tour. Highly recommended and in a great part of London with Big Ben and the House of Parliament so close by."

There is a little cafe and it food is very nice and a bit expensive but its bustling with the atmosphere of the whole place.

We did this and when you have your ticket printed with you, you skip every line and go directly inside. It saved us a LOT of valuable time.

Get a guide or at least the audio tour and plan on spending a long time after the tour is over. The building itself is quite historic going back to William the Conqueror. Be sure and tour the Abbey's grounds for a change. HIstory will come alive for you. I particularly enjoyed Elizabeth I's chapel where she and her sisters are buried. Visit the area where Elizabeth II's coronation and Charles and Diana's wedding took place. Be sure and note the monuments to the various soldiers and sailors. Many many notables are buried here. I would suggest you get a listing of them from online and visit the tombs of those you are most interested in. No food, and the Abbey is only moderately handicapped accessible. Be sure and schedule a time to visit when a servie will be heard."

There was already about 100 people in line. There is a little cafe kiosk that served coffee and snacks on the corner of the Abbey. We got coffees and a pastry to share. We left our apartment very early because of rush hour on the tube (very busy at this time and took longer than we expected). We waited a little over an hour to get in. The inside is very dark and takes a little while to get used to. We got our audio guides (recommended), and enjoyed the self guided tour. It is just amazing, all the history and beautiful artifacts. The ceilings were incredible. It got extremely crowded which made it hard to stop and take a closer look. All in all it was very beautiful and not to be missed.

He had such a great wit and all the little insights that truly made this an enjoyable visit on a rainy day. The mausoleum for some of the great kings and also infamously knighted people are very interesting. To think of all this history is almost overwhelming. They only offer two private tours per day with less than 20 people, so register at the Abbey early. Within the Abbey, Kings, Queens, poets, entertainers all buried within these walls. It is considered the people's church and a big tourists attraction."

Although it was busy you still got to see everything including poets corner and the tombs of Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I. I really wanted to see Mary's tomb and wasn't disappointed.I only give a 3 out of 5 because you misrepresented online booking and the cost.

The rich history is fantastic, but next to the Sistine Chapel, this is the most beautiful church in the world. The coronations, funerals, and weddings that have gone on in the Abbey lend themselves to a depth of history second only to Rome. The audio tour is full of all the historical significance that would keep an avid sightseer entertained and educated. There are shops, and small eateries for you along the way, and you can opt in to a guided tour for pay, the audio tour is free. Be respectful that this is a church and not a museum like the Tower of London. They do have prayer and areas that may be closed off for sacred events.Some highlights of the tour include: Queen Elizabeth 1, Mary Tudor, and Mary Queen of Scots graves. There are also the graves of Isaac Newton, and several famous historical poets, like Charles Dickens. No Photos!"

Definitely leave between 2/3 hours to wander around especially if you plan to listen to the audio guide."

My husband stayed outside with our 2 boys, ages 9 & 7, and I went in with my mother. Audio guides are free, and give more information than you could ever want. There are plenty of friendly staff stationed throughout to guide you and answer any questions. If you are a Royal Watcher, this is the place where everyone gets married. It's super fun and cool to walk the same floors that millions of people see on TV when royals get married! No photography allowed inside."

It has also been described as the \u201cparish church of the world\u201d. The nearest underground station is St James\u2019s Park.The Abbey is steeped in over a thousand years of history. Benedictine monks came here around the tenth century, to set up a tradition of daily prayers and worship. It is first and foremost a place of worship which unfortunately many tourists seem to forget.Seventeen monarchs are buried in The Abbey as are some of the most notable people in British history. It also has the tomb of the Unknown Warrior. There are beautiful stained glass windows around the Abbey. You are not allowed to photograph within the Abbey Church \u2013 which again many tourists seem to forget.The Queen\u2019s coronation ceremony took place in Westminster Abbey.Last entry is at 3.30pm and the Abbey closes an hour after this time. Admission prices online are GBP20.00 per adult and GBP 9.00 per child up to 16 years of age. A family of 2 adults and 2 children costs GBP45.00."

I really liked that because it meant that the fact that I hadn't researched the history beforehand was taken care of. If there weren't audio guides, then I wouldn't have really noticed just how much history I was walking through. This is a great place to go if you have any interest in British history. There are many influential figures of history buried there such as Mary Queen of Scots. Also, the architecture is really beautiful. It has the type of ceiling which you could just lie on your back and stare at for a while. This would also be a great trip if you follow the British royalty as this is where most of them are crowned, married, and buried. Westminster Abbey is right next to Big Ben as well, so those two kind of go hand in hand. Overall it was a great visit!"

In itself that's not a bad thing as you see everything and it controls the crowds but it does make you feel like you're just being shepherded around and you don't have time to really see everything. Also, you can't take pictures, even non-flash pictures, which seems odd when you compare it to other European and London 'attractions' of this nature.It's a beautiful abbey and I am glad I went BUT it does feel wrong to have to pay so much for an experience which isn't what I thought it would be."

I could have spent several days in there. They give you an audio device that tells you a story about many of the locations within the abbey. It's a bit hard to see many of the posted numbers but the map you are given should help. Sadly, you cannot take pictures inside the abbey.

Although a place of worship has existed on this site since before the Norman Conquest, the present church was begun in 1245. There is so much to look at and absorb that you need time, comfortable shoes and probably to make more than one visit. For me the most memorable part was seeing the death masks of both Elizabeth 1 and her sister Mary, Queen of Scots, and the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The ceiling is a joy to crane your neck to see. If you can, try to attend Evensong or the daily short prayer at 11am."

Of particular interest to me were the tombs and shrines of royals such as Edward the Confessor, Edward I, Henry III, Henry VII, Elizabeth I and Mary I.

I don't want to spoil any surprises for anyone as discovery is part of the pleasure but there is something for everyone there. I used the audio tour and took my time ambling around, there are plenty of places to sit during the first half of the tour but not so many once you have gone past the coronation area. The audio tour was sufficient but if I go again I would definitely go with the tour guides ( arranged at front desk), I could hear them going into more detail for other visitors going around. The museum was shut when I went but the gardens etc were open and pleasant enough. The toilets are at the end of the tour so a comfort break might be in order before visiting. The toilets are near the cafe and are clean enough, I had tea and scones for \u00a37 in the cafe around 11.30 and I could see it was going to get very busy at lunchtime.

The Abbey is the resting place of numerous kings and queens and other notable figures in history and the guide gave fascinating information on their lives and deaths. Take some time to just take it all in and look at the small details found everywhere. If you are going solely to take photos, forget about it as you are not allowed to take them inside. We saw many people trying to sneak them anyway and found it incredibly disrespectful in such a place. Expect to spend a couple of hours touring the Abbey if you want to see everything.

Queen Elizabeth II was crowned here and one can see the original Coronation chair; not as ornate as one would expect for Royalty, but is very old, and was no doubt covered by her Royal coronation robes anyway. This abbey serves many purposes; it is the place where new knights are installed in the Order of the Bath. It houses the tombs of many famous people, including that of Royal Sovereigns as far back as Elizabeth I, Edward the Confessor King, etc., and others, eg., poets, politicians and the like. Not to mention home for the many wonderful portraits which are hung here. The workmanship is exquisite. The quire stalls are also a site to behold and one can only imagine the wonderful voices singing the hymns on royal and other Holy occasions. But the public can attend the services. Founded as a Benedictine monastry, it is a living church in that it is still used for worship as well as for royal occasions.We were only going to stay a short while, but ended up staying for a few hours it was so wonderful. It is not inexpensive but is money well spent. Tickets can be bought on line and save time but one still has to queue for the security check. It is located near the houses of Parliament and Big Ben."

The audio guide was fantastic and very informative. Although I really wanted to take pictures as everything was so beautiful I think it's better that photos are not allowed to protect the sanctity of the place. It was very peaceful walking around and taking everything in. This was part of a 3 week trip I planned for my partner who had never been to England, and he told me this was one of the highlights for him. The price to get in is a little expensive, but it's worth the cost."

It also pointed out aspects of the Abbey, which would have skipped right by us were it not for the informative audio guides.It's just a shame photos were not allowed in most areas, as there's no words that can describe this amazing structure."

And again he just said \"up there\" pointing his finger towards Victoria and turned his back on the lady, as she was a little perplexed with his lack of assistance I decided to help her and told her how to get to the Cathedral.I would seriously urge the Westminster Abbey \"Management\" to undertake some training with their door staff, as I found it disgraceful that someone working in the house of god can treat someone this way.What a great advertisement for UK tourism, I think not!"

We didn't purchase the audio tour, but it's probably worth it as the floor map has minimal information. Great historical significance in a small space."

You can buy the Tour for 20 pounds ($30) Monday through Saturday which gets you in to see the entire inside chapels and tombs (there are lots). Or you can go to a 5 PM church service for free (please leave a donation) called Evensong (about 45 minutes long). You get to sit in the main Chapel and hear the spectacular boys choir and experience the Abby as a church which it is. This was the most relaxing and fulfilling part of our 5 day trip in London. If you only do Evensong buy and read the Guide for the tour in gift shop before you go to the service. The line for Evensong is at entrance where gift shop and starts forming around 4 PM. Guides in robes will guide you. The earlier you get there you might get to sit in ornate pews on sides by the boys choir rather than temporary chairs in center. Either way you won't be disappointed."

Many days are sold out so if you want to see it, just book online. Also be sure and get the audio or you will have no idea what you are looking at. This is a place you can spend about 3-4 hours. You can however do it quickly, but you will miss things, so I suggest take it slow and take it all in. You can however do both the Westminster Abbey and the House of Parliament on the same day, and when your finished walk the bridge over the river look back and take a picture of Big Ben."

Had I known how absolutely amazing it was inside, I would have visited a long time ago. Everywhere you look is pure beauty and so much history your head starts to spin. You cannot take photos inside, which, as a photographer, almost killed me, but if you take your time and really look around you will see sights that will stick with you forever.Enter through the north door and turn right down the north aisle. At the end, see the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, as well as the Coronation Chair. From here, turn around and head down the nave, through the choir and to the High Alter. It is stunning, and so fascinating to think of all the monarchs who have been crowned and weddings that have taken place here. Around behind the High Alter is Henry VII\u2019s Chapel, more commonly known as the Lady\u2019s Chapel, which is stunning in every way. Just look up and you\u2019ll understand what I mean. On opposite sides, see Elizabeth I\u2019s tomb and Mary Queen of Scots tomb; both very fitting memorials. On the left, see Poet\u2019s Corner, where the greatest poets, authors, musicians and even actors are either buried or honored for their contributions, including William Shakespeare, T.S. Elliot, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Robert Burns, George Frederic Handel, and Lawrence Olivier. The first to be interred here was Geoffrey Chaucer. Wow!From here, be sure to visit the Chapterhouse, Norman undercroft and cloisters. The gardens are especially beautiful and well worth a look. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend a stop at Westminster Abbey. It is one of the highlights of a trip to London."

The inside was even more awe-inspiring. The sheer number and beauty of the monuments was phenomenal. For me, the Scientist's Corner was the highlight, including Maxwell, Darwin, and of course Newton. Quite humbling and inspiring at the same time. I also really enjoyed the Poet's Corner, including Tennyson, the Bronte sisters, Jane Austen, and Dickens.

The most special part for me was the prayer service in the oldest part of the Cathedral, it is not typically accessible and only for the sure-footed. My toddler was asleep in his carrier which was the only reason he was permitted up. When he woke up, the cloisters made for a great place to work off some extra energy. I was not expecting to come across \"Britain's Oldest Door,\" but that was a labelled attraction while walking the Cloisters. The little gardens in the middle were a calm oasis amid the grandeur and crowds. This is definitely a popular location, so bring your rain gear because you will have to wait in line outside."

Please use them as there is so much to be seen and so much of history lies here which these guides explain. The Abbey has tombs of numerous royals and famous people. I was really excited to see Isaac Newton's tomb and the Poet's Corner. Many of the famous British poets' grave are there in this area. But what a pity , people can freely walk over these graves. Maybe it is a poignant reminder that after death even the biggest of names are reduced to dust.History buffs can easily spend half a day or even more in the Abbey. We spent only a couple of hours here as my family including our teenager children became restless after some time. But there was a lot of stuff that we couldn't cover in this short time.

We all know of the architecture and grand history of Westminster Abbey, and sure it's filled with the notable dead, but it's the living that make this place even more delightful. I am disabled, and they made sure my visit was on parr with everyone else's. They stored my walker and loaned me a wheelchair, and arranged paths to accommodate my needs. Every single person I encountered was welcoming and warm. I am not even a Christian, but was definitely shown the traits called for in their religion that one hardly ever sees anymore. In addition to their kindness, the Abbey is fantastically beautiful. Put it high on your \"to visit\" list."

We originally stood in the line for LondonPass and Internet tickets but no one was telling anyone that was the purpose of the line up.The longer line up was for visitors who needed to buy a ticket.We arrived in the abbey with just enough time to book the GUIDED TOUR for an additional 5 EU per person. The tour lasts 1.5 hours, is conducted by a VERGER, a robed employee of the Abbey who assists with royal ceremonies and church services.WORTH EVERY PENNY. A great investment. The Verger provides detailed information and leads you on a historical walk of the Abbey and adds humorous anecdotes. The guided tour gives you access to a place the audio guided tours do not permit visitors: the inner alter which is a small alter area where Will & Kate disappeared to when they signed the registry.The guided tour provides interesting info also about how the Abbey is set up for CORONATION SERVICES and the process of crowning the Queen, and the history of the Coronation Throne which is also on display there.The guide was very knowledgeable about the various tombs and details tourists would be interested to know.We thoroughly enjoyed visiting the Abbey and the guided tour by a Verger made it come alive!FYI: PHOTOS ARE NOT PERMITTED IN THE ABBEY and they strictly monitor that.Although we hoped to visit EVENSONG, we didn't have time to come back.If you have an opportunity, Evensong is daily at 5pm or Saturday at 3:00 and it's FREE.It's a music based worship service with scripture reading. If you arrive early enough you sit in the Quoir with the Choir."

After getting settled in our hotel and learning how to take a public bus (very easy) to Westminster, we were on our way. We were delighted to walk right in - no lines, no waiting!After paying the entrance fee, we were offered a headset for a self-guided tour. Definitely take the headset as it provided valuable information on the various parts of the cathedral and visitors are able to tour at their leisure. We were fortunate that a service was being held as we walked through and we were able to hear the wonderful organ music.Westminster Abbey is filled with so much history in the form of artifacts, memorials, and tombs. Many notables are entombed here including monarchs and poets. This is such an interesting place and should be on everyone's list of must-see places in London.Try to go on Wednesday afternoon after 4:30PM. The crowd was very light. As we passed Westminster Abbey the next day, it was mobbed with people!"

We had our tickets pre booked and saved on my phone. We went straight in with no huge queue to have to stand in. We were given our wristbands, shown where to get our audio tour and off we went. The audio was factual and not too long to listen to. The tombs and memorials were absolutely mesmerising and the hourly prayer read out was a wonderful way to slow the day down to a peaceful calm. All the staff were happy and polite. Especially the gentleman at the end collecting our head sets who was guessing the nationalities of the guests, with a huge degree of accuracy. We met the abbey cat inside who was lapping up all the attention! Would defiantly recommend to everyone with a passion for history!!!"

It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not interesting, it\u2019s just that the cynic in me says it\u2019s an ornate cathedral with lots of dead people. Is that heretical? Historical, yes. Beautiful, yes. Famous, yes. Much of the history buried in the cathedral is available other places and seemed repetitive. Before you even get inside, you should admire the architecture and the beauty of this grand cathedral. Pay attention to the details, because that\u2019s where it\u2019s really interesting. You\u2019ll see gargoyles, intricate carvings of faces and masterful stonework. A tour about the exterior architecture would be a wonderful complement to the inside tour. See if you can find the statues of ten 20th century Christian martyrs above the Great West Door. Once inside, get an audio tour (it\u2019s included in the price of admission) and start your self-guided tour. There\u2019s good commentary of the fascinating history within its walls. Pictures however are forbidden.I was disappointed to learn that some plaques are simply commemorative, historical markers for famous people that aren\u2019t actually buried in Westminster. It\u2019s simply a sign of honor and distinction. By all means, visit. I just didn\u2019t find it as interesting the second time."

We took advantage of the 241 rail card offer, (I would say \u00a320 per adult is a little steep). Audio phones were on offer & we took advantage; I would recommend these as it gave you some useful information at certain points along the way. Best for use in conjunction with the free maps. Staff were friendly & helpful; one advised us that the upstairs part of the Abbey would be opening in 2018 so it may be worth a re-visit at this time. There were plenty of people visiting, however, it didn't feel too packed in the Abbey itself. I believe a couple of hours maximum is all you need to see what's inside. If you like history then the Abbey is definitely worth a visit."

We were given a headset and keyed in the numbers on the plan as we walked round. Just as well really because a lot of the inscriptions were in Latin. One or two of the numbered areas past the nave were also a little hard to find. Nearly all of Britain's monarchs had their coronations here and there are many of them now rest here but I was just overwhelmed by the sheer number of tourists bustling through. It actually felt a little bit disrespectful for those who are buried here and I question why the church asks for charitable donations when they are surely receiving thousands of pounds worth of revenue every week... Most of the museums in London don't get this sort of wealth!!"

The public tour, including individual audio data, was fantastic. It was all I could do to keep moving throughout the magnificent facility; the stunning architecture and the history of this church were nearly overwhelming to me. Details and guidelines provided by the audio headset information were of great assistance. If you tour, please take advantage of this free service.As a Christian woman, I wanted to attend a service on the Sunday I was in London. I was so excited that I actually was prepared to go on Saturday! I was kindly prevented from catching the bus from my hotel by the wonderful concierge at the Grosvenor Victoria, who gently informed me of the correct day of the week! I did, however, attend an 8:00 service the next day (appropriately Sunday...) , and it was lovely. Visiting and photographing this incredible cathedral were a major highlight of my trip. Not only is it the site of many, many historical occasions, but it is a functioning parish for the Anglican Church of England. I am blessed for spending time there."

It is breathtaking beautiful and romantic!We loved seeing where \"William Wilberforce\" (Who led the movement to abolish slavery) is buried and near by is his friend, Prime Minister, William Pitt, who played such an important role in \"Pittsburg, PA\" after all its named after him. Also you'll see Isaac Newton's tomb, and so many heroic people's tombs. And oh my goodness! Queen Elizabeth I, buried in a most beautiful marble sculptured tomb of her on the top of the tomb. Also to be able to stand and see where Queen Elizabeth and Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh and also Prince William and Cate, were married. Was so exciting!!! There is so much to see and experience for history lovers! which we are. They also have a lovely gift shop with beautiful things to purchase and bring back to family and friends! We will definitely go again and again."

Thoroughly enjoyable and the audio information is as good as I've experienced elsewhere. Enjoy and let the history soak in.

The verger is able to answer questions about a wide range of subjects of interest to visitors to the Abbeywhether it's a first visit or a repeat visit. Every time I visit I appreciate the grace,beauty and power of the architecture, centuries old, the resonance of being in a placewhere so many have communed with their maker for so long.

They claim to allow 'skipping' the lines and give you a quicker entrance....not the case. As I was told, by employees, you need to purchase your ticket from the Abbey website and print it. That said, the line moves rather quickly.I had no idea there were tombs inside including legendary names such as 'King Henry the VII' and Charles Darwin. The coronation chair is amazing to see...what history. The audio guide is worth the purchase, otherwise, you're just looking at things."

There is so much to see inside the Abbey. Set aside at least two hours to see everything and more time if you want do more than just walk through. There is an area where you can sit down and light candles, listen to a choir, or just rest while you look at all the amazing things in that area. The beautiful architecture, the tombs of famous people (including the poets' section which I enjoyed) and the entire atmosphere kept us in awe.

Then my nine-year-old had to go to the bathroom. While the pastor was talking about worshipping God the staff was treating us like we were an inconvenience. Which apparently we were. I guess they didn't get the little memo about when we welcome a little child we are welcoming Jesus. Or the part where Jesus talked about showing hospitality to strangers. So we couldn't go to bathroom #1 because there was an event going on. They shipped us outside to bathroom #2. We couldn't use that bathroom because the guard said would couldn't. The grumpy bathroom bouncer was kind enough to send us across the street to a bathroom that was locked. Meanwhile...the above mentioned nine-year-old has had a bladder that is ready to burst. We try to get back in the church. I finally talked my way through the security. Then James and John cut us off because worship was going on which was the whole reason we wanted to go back in. We did get to dismiss with the masses which is a euphemism for the guards detaining us from going out the main doors because of an event. They opened God's table to all. Except a visiting pastor and his nine-year-old son."

Memorials for many famous artists, musicians (Handel), writers....You many also learn much interesting about England's complicated history with Scotland. There's also one chapel which unfortunately I've forgot the name of it, with spectacular a ceiling, a marvellous demonstration of carving art.

Eucharist was open to all who partake at their home church.A bust of William Blake stared at me throughout the service, and some of the folding chairs were on top of commemorative stones. I was seated in Poet's Corner, yet I didn't realize it until I left. I'll return another day to explore the area.Friendly yet firm guides asked visitors to return Monday through Saturday when services are not held.

The English-language tour is narrated by the delicious Jeremy Irons.Every monarch since William the Conqueror has been crowned here, with the exception of Edward V who was murdered beforehand, and Edward VIII who abdicated because of his love for Mrs. Simpson.The magnificent tiled sanctuary is the iconic centrepiece of the Abbey and is stage for coronations, royal weddings and funerals.The British monarchs that have been interred here, are as follows:-\u2022 St Edward the Confessor and his wife, Edith of Wessex (St Edward was the founder of the Abbey)\u2022 Henry III of England\u2022 Edward I of England and his wife, Eleanor of Castile\u2022 Edward III of England and his wife, Philippa of Hainault\u2022 Richard II of England and his wife, Anne of Bohemia\u2022 Henry V of England and his wife, Catherine of Valois\u2022 Edward V of England\u2022 Anne Neville, wife of Richard III\u2022 Henry VII of England and his wife, Elizabeth of York\u2022 Edward VI of England\u2022 Anne of Cleves, wife of King Henry VIII\u2022 Mary I of England\u2022 Elizabeth I of England\u2022 James VI & I of Scotland England and Ireland and his wife, Anne of Denmark\u2022 Charles II of England and Scotland\u2022 Mary II of England and Scotland\u2022 William III of England and II of Scotland\u2022 Anne, Queen of Great Britain and her husband, Prince George of Denmark\u2022 George II of Great Britain and his wife, Caroline of Ansbach\u2022 Mary, Queen of Scots, mother of James VI & IPoets' Corner is the resting place of Chaucer, Dickens, Hardy, Tennyson, Dr Johnson and Kipling, as well as Handel and Sir Isaac Newton.Interesting Fact: In the 19th century researchers were looking for the tomb of James I, because he had gone walkies and nobody knew where he was. During their search they opened the vault containing the remains of Elizabeth I and her half-sister, Mary I of England (who had the then Princess Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower). Both lead coffins were founded stacked, with Elizabeth's resting on top of Mary's.James I was finally found... in the vault of Henry VII."

It's hard to grasp that so many figures from British history have their last resting place in the abbey - that's actually them beneath those plinths and flagstones.The only thing I struggle with, as I do in all Cathedrals etc, is having to pay an admission fee. It brings to mind Jesus in the temple with the money lenders. I'd happily donate to the upkeep, but I do resent being forced to pay: it's taken 10 years to persuade me to go inside!"

The first two times we didn't bother to get off the bus as the lineups were incredibly long. The third time by the Abbey, there were no lineups at all so we jumped off the bus and walked right in. We used our London Pass so we were covered for the entrance fees. The Abbey was overwhelmingly beautiful and we could have spent far more than the precious hour we were able to spend there. My favorite stops were to see the crypts of half sisters, Queen Elizabeth I and Mary Tudor, and their cousin Mary, Queen of Scots (beheaded on the order of Elizabeth I) entombed directly across from Elizabeth I on the other side of the Abbey. Religiously and historically the Abbey is a must-see but to avoid lines plan for first visit in the morning or later in the afternoon. TIP: buy the guidebook as you won't remember a third of what you see. Also use the commentary headset to get the most of your tour. "

Two things that are important, they now charge \u00a320 to enter and NO PICTURES can be taken inside. I suggest a minimum of three-four hours as it seemed to be an extremely popular site and was packed full of people (Saturday visit). The audio tour is nice to do on your own, but let me recommend the Verger tour (approx. 90-120 mins). A Verger is someone who works in the church and helps make the church work smoothly as such. They help with services and other responsibilities. You can tell them apart from other guides by their black long verger gown. It is an extra \u00a35 added to the \u00a320, but well worth it as you will learn more and get to go into areas others cannot. The tours are limited to 20 people per tour, so as soon as you get into the Abbey, check at the information desk for the next possible tour. We got there at 12:30 and still hadn't seen everything by 4:30 p.m. With the Verger Tour, you are invited to Evening Song and the Verger will get you seats in a prime area. Another must do. The music and voices is heavenly. Take your time and look at every little detail of the Abbey. Well worth the \u00a325 for the visit."

The blues start as early as the lines, long but are efficiently guided, you pay \u00a320 for entrance and audioguide, you move along the lines and marked interest points. You see amazing statuary marking the graves of people you know nothing about, but have shaped England. It's dirty-looking and Gothic and old and relevant only l if you wish to understand a bit more of the thoughts of kinghood and empire ie: the need to rest stately and be remembered for grand things. It's a thousand year old mausoleum that functions as a transient's church. Where the oldest graves are disintegrating lumps and can't be touched for fear of collapse and the newest ones can be gaudy and as far from a spiritual monument as a Hollywood prop. It remembers the masses and the sacrifice to a righteous cause (the Unknown Soldier) and memorializes singular genius (Newton) in and among those who may have bought themselves niches in history. I don't know for sure, but it's human nature is it not? It's interesting, when you think about it you will be hard pressed to see past the spectacle and the reminders of finite time to a place of hope....I doubt if it will lift you up at all, despite all the achievements & gravitas and pageantry mori. I'm not saying it won't but for me it made this clear : our time ends, marble & history encased or not. And then you run out of buttons to push and you shuffle out...but before you walk through the glass you see a small American eagle looking fierce in a corner, away from the ages of kings and hallowed places. He is part if FDR's commemorative plaque as a friend of Great Britain. Odd, but for me, he (the eagle, not FDR) was the only thing there untouched by age...he looked alive and new and unwilling to rest stately at all. Fierce. But maybe that's because he was near the door and in the light and my mind had had enough of my moroseness.Of course, Westminster Abbey has to be seen..the above review notwithstanding, Thank God."

If we had done nothing else during our trip, visiting Westminster would have made the trip worthwhile. This is the building in which British royalty has been married for centuries. Kate and William were married here. The only royals to break tradition and get married at St. Paul's Cathedral are Charles and Diana. The audio tour is very complete and discusses so many interesting points. The docents are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. It is obvious that they all love their jobs. The interior of the building is beautiful, although the stone walls are dirtier than I expected from the touch of visitors over the centuries. One could spend a full day reading the memorials and discovering the names of people who are buried there. The graves for Darwin and Newton are quite obvious. One must pass through the archway where they are buried to go from the entrance of the abbey to the altar. One section contains the graves of famous literary figures. I would not have wanted to miss visiting Westminster Abbey.A bit of advice, the line of visitors gets very long. Order and pay for tickets online before your visit. This allows one to go to the head of the line rather than waiting for an hour or longer."

He lifted the rope and said, \"Come in here.\" It basically allowed me to skip the line and walk right in. They give you a headset that provides a lot of information as you walk through. The place is a \"Who's Who\" of British history. I would have appreciated more explanation of the religious art and the religious nature of the building, but I suppose not everyone would want that. My two favorites were the Lady Chapel (beautiful!) and the Chapter House. Many people might miss the Chapter House because it's not inside the Church. Be sure to walk down the cloister when you're done and you'll see it, as well as gardens. I would have really liked some places to sit down in the Lady Chapel and Chapter House to just pray and/or reflect, but you can't do that. Nowhere to sit. I would say I found this to be a great place as an experience of history (which I love), but disappointing if wanting a religious experience."

This is a must for anyone visiting London, it is full of interesting artefacts, none less than the stones that mark the graves of famous people that lie beneath them. We queued for 20 minutes on a warm sunny day but the queue went quick enough. You have to own your bags for security but this is no problem and the gentleman doing this was friendly but firm - nothing would get past him. We were struck by how immaculate all the staff were, which is not always the case. Once inside you are guided by a lady checking size of your group and directing you accordingly to the appropriate cashier. Then you pick up an audio guide (included in the entrance fee) and s map of the Abbey . As you listen to the audio guide you will see people simultaneously staring at different parts of the Abbey, it's quite amusing to watch them. The real gems are the people working in the Abbey - the people in the Green robes are volunteers, with extensive knowledge about the Abbey, they should not be missed out, they stand quite unabtrosfully and will answer any questions that you may have - the are a fountain of information. We spent a lot of time with one such lady and her information was extensive and extremely interesting.The staff in the Red robes are salaried staff. They too are equally knowledgeable and full of interesting facts and information. We spent sometime with a lady in the Lady Chapel and she was extremely interesting and informative .We throughly enjoyed our visit to the Abbey. One word of warning though, there are no seats around the Abbey, just the ones in the main body of the Abbey, so do take time to sit & view the ceiling & feel the atmosphere while you rest. No visit would be complete unless you visit this wonderful Abbey."

To say that this church is awe inspiring is to put it mildly! Breathtaking is a more accurate description. This venue is more than 900 years old and is the resting place of notables such as King Richard, Elizabeth The Virgin Queen, her arch rival Mary Queen of Scott's entombed next to her tormenting her for all eternity, Sir Isaac Newton, and Charles Darwin author of The Evolution of Species, to name just a few. The famous and infamous are laid to rest here at this magnificent chapel and you will be fascinated for every second of your time there! I arrived early just after opening and I cannot recommend doing that enough! The price of entry and the Audio tour was 20 Pounds and worth every penny. Arriving early will help with the crowds as once the day wears on it gets packed. You will need to allow your self three to three and a half hours at this chapel and do not rush! Explore every nook and cranny and soak it up. The tombs and monuments there-in are amazing and the rich history of coronations and funerals there is enough to make your head spin. The Abby is the Spiritual Center of London and it's not to be missed. You can light candles there for loved ones for just a small donation. If you are a history buff you will be thrilled with a visit here. It is very close to the Westminster Tube Station and just adjacent to Big Ben so it's easy to find. There are NO PHOTOS allowed inside so be prepared not to be able to take them. Make the time to visit the Abby in her 900 years of glory! I'm so glad that I did."

The audio tour was absolutely fantastic--full of interesting info and easy to use. Jeremy Irons narrates and his voice is perfect for this church tour, lol. It keeps you moving throughout the church and offeres lots of spots to just sit and take it all in. You can attend a service too. If you have kids with you be aware the church is very quiet and you'd probably want to move a bit faster through the various rooms, but I do think kids would find it interesting. There were a bunch of people with strollers taking the tour without issue. There is lots to see outside the main church as well (plus restrooms and cafe) overall I loved this tour and would recommend it to anyone."

Being English, my childhood was full of stories of our monarchy from the very establishment of an 'English' king. I feel a deep connection to the monarchs crowned and then buried in the Abbey. It is part of who I am. However, it is difficult to even walk around the Abbey because there are just so many people inside at any one time, and even more difficult to actually get close to most things. I doubt that most tourists even know what they are looking at. Obviously, more people means more money for the Abbey. Expect to wait a good while before gaining admittance and look forward to being a sardine during your visit. Photography is not allowed but it wouldn't make any difference if it were."

Don't expect to take pictures though, as they are forbidden; however, I think it helps keep the crowds moving. Another London location to go early in the day to avoid the huge crowds."

The very first poet interred here was Geoffrey Chaucer in 1400! \"Canterbury Tales\" anyone? High school AP English flashback, anyone? Anyway, our professor, \"Dr. D\" had seen fit that all of us memorize and recite ye Olde English version of the General Prologue to the Tales. Twas a nightmarish twillig gillig! Or something. I've forgotten the Prelude but never have forgotten Chaucer. He'd written one about Armageddon but I like thinking it's how one could strive to live in the present moment. Why not work like this now?...\"To splash at a ten-league canvas, with brushes of comet's hair\" sounds good. And then get a load of those last three lines. That's the way to live. Why wait until you are dead?"

There were a few things closed that day - the gardens and the little cloister, to be specific - but there's still plenty to see. The Abbey does tend to get crowded, so I would recommend going early, if at all possible. We got there about half an hour after they opened their doors, and it was just starting to get stifling. By the time we left, the crowd index was insanely high. I love that you're allowed to walk at your pace, and to take your time in viewing all the history surrounding you. It's amazing to me the things they have on display - that they were recovered, that they're in such fine condition, that they leave them within touching distance of some of the more oblivious tourists."

I had been carrying a plastic bag around with two banana peels in it for hours and needed to make room for the gifts I was about to buy in my backpack. I asked twice could I please throw away this plastic bag in your trash. I was told no the first time and I thought well maybe they can't do that for every tourist. I'll see if they do when I get to the register. The unfriendly cashier again informed me even though I was about to spend roughly $70 American dollars there that no she did not have trash in the store at all and she could not take my small plastic bag. This was really infuriating considering I was trying to be respectful of the city & not litter and I was a good paying customer. So, I couldn't bring myself to patronage their store and when she told me after ringing me up that I couldn't use their trash, I said I'm not going to purchase these items and left. She said nothing.

Photography is (rightly) forbidden but it doesn't stop the selfie stick generation from trying.However, the grand history of the place is magnificent and the tales brought to mind and narrated on the audio tour are fascinating... from royalty to Poets' Corner there are memorials and burial places of familiar names throughout.From the magnificence of the main Nave to the tiny memorial chapels the architecture is awe inspiring and from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to the Coronation Chair (finally and happily without the Stone of Scone) the history is palpable and I deny anyone not to feel a little wonderstruck.A fantastic building in which to spend a good couple of hours and, now that I've been once, I'd love to come back on a quieter day and spend a lot more time exploring the place without the cattle market atmosphere."

Unfortunately, we did not have time to stand in line to see the interior, but I still loved seeing this monstrous church! There is no way possible to could miss this church. It is absolutely gorgeous! During our Sandeman's walking tour of London, I learned that usually royalty have their weddings here. For anyone old enough to remember Princess Di's wedding shown on tv, I kept thinking \"This cannot be that church.\""

Thank you for them!The whole tour is like walking through history, meeting kings and queens buried there who you only know of from your history books, and also The Poets' Corner gives you a chance to revise all those giants' names who you don't read nowadays as bedtime reading :).A wonderful visit, no-one should miss it."

Well worth booking direct on the Abbey website if you do not want a long wait.The audio tour is informative and spreads people out in the abbey and it is a pleasant experience not overcrowded and the bits of information are short and to the point.Magnificent building with friendly staff well worth the long queue."

After seeing many famous churches throughout Europe with a smaller admission charge or ones that are free (e.g. Notre Dame in Paris), I was a little skeptical on why the 20GBP admission fee. Just walk inside and see centuries of history and the who's who of tombs and you will leave with a big smile on your face. The surprise during this trip was the ability to walk through Abbey gardens and they were in their full spring glory. Also provides a nice backdrop of pictures for Parliament as well from the gardens. No pictures are allowed inside the abbey which is disappointing, but understandable with the volume of people and a sacred place of worship."

Once within sight of the place; however, it was easy to not get lost. There is a not insignificant price for entering. I must say I was a bit surprised at how expensive was the price of admission given I was entering a church. On the plus side you can get audio guides for free and these were very helpful though for some people a guide would probably be very useful as the ones we overheard were very informative and answered questions readily. I tend to want to go on my own pace so opted for the audiotape guide.This is not the place for people who feel uncomfortable if there are a lot of tombs around, which turned out to be a problem for my friend. This is also not a place for one to step in and not spend hours going through the different chapels and corners where prominent people and royalty are housed. One quickly succumbs to information overload and has to adjust the amount of attention one gives to the different effects. We spent a good 4 hours here and barely touched the place, though we did walk through all the areas, Lord Nelson's tomb is a do not miss as is the tomb of the unknown soldier, Poet's corner and the Lady's Chapel. Some of the tombs and the search for some of the people, such as one needs to do in Poet's Corner demand a lot of time and close attention.Gorgeous building inside and out. A real must see. Luckily we are planning to return and since I have now been here once I know to spend a few hours a day soaking in information and visual delights and then heading outside to recuperate to return the next day."

Westminster Abbey is one of London's iconic buildings and a must visit whilst in the city, however although we have visited London often, the \u00a320 entrance fee always seemed to be steep! That said we made use of South West trains 2 for 1 which makes the visit far more reasonable. On arrival there was a long queue however this was clearly well managed by staff and we were quickly in the Abbey being directed to the efficient ticket desk. The next stage is the audio guide desk which I would recommend, the guide (which is in multiple languages) was easy to use (unlike St Pauls) following a logically route around the Abbey with plenty of information helped by the map provided and signage. The guide takes everyone in a circulatory route which helps to reduce pinch points and although busy wasn't over crowded. The Abbey as expected is full of English history and was as expected, one f the most important buildings in the country. Outside the Abbey main building there are the cloisters and a garden to visit which gives a further insight. On a practical level there are new toilets and a caf\u00e9 which we didn't use. Westminster Abbey not surprisingly doesn't disappoint and should be included on any itinerary whilst visiting London (if you can swallow paying the \u00a320 entrance fee). Recommended."

Every nook and cranny of the place seems stuffed with a monument to great kings and noteworthy contributors to the fabric of Great Britain. Westminster Abbey is definitely worth a couple of hours to take in, and the Lady Chapel steals the show.  > Buy tickets online in advance to avoid the long lines to get in > Get the audio guide on your smartphone by downloading it ahead of time > No Photos allowed inside the Abbey > Use caution as floors are uneven and there are lots of stairsThe line to get into Westminster Abbey can be quite long, but you don\u2019t have to stand in it with a little pre-planning. When we arrived on rainy Friday afternoon, it stretched the entire length of the Abbey and around the corner. To save time, order your tickets ahead online. We did, and when we arrived and saw the daunting line, we were disappointed. However, we went to the attendant at the front of the line and asked where to go if we already had tickets -- he looked surprised, checked our tickets, and then let us in right there, and we skipped the whole line completely. Download the audio tour to your iPhone or Android device yourself before going. It\u2019s available via the Abbey\u2019s website, Apple Store, and Google Play. It is the same tour you get if you wait in (another) line to pick up a headset tour in the Abbey, and quite helpful for making sense of all that is around you. They don\u2019t allow pictures inside the Abbey, which is a shame, but pretty standard in the UK. Many of the floors are quite uneven, and there are a number of steps inside the Abbey. I wouldn\u2019t say this was a particularly accessible attraction if that would be limiting to you. Finally, the cafe at Westminster Abbey is among the better \u201cattractions cafes\u201d we ate at during our trip, so don\u2019t hesitate to give them a try."

The tour starts with a walk through the tombs of some of the most notable figures in history, including Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton, before bringing you to the tomb of the unknown soldier. From there you begin the walk up the aisle towards the nave and quire before coming to the high altar which has seen the Coronation of Kings and Queens, royal weddings and funerals. It is stunning and you can't help but be moved by it. Following this, the tour takes you past the tombs of Edward the Confessor, Edward Longshanks, Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots and many other Kings and Queens. Poets' Corner is the resting place for Chaucer, Tennyson and Dickens and memorialises the likes of Shakespeare and Austen.

The main sections of the Abbey are beautiful, but what really surprised me was the amount of space give over to tombs rather than religion. I don't mean any disrespect, but in a house of God should the need to glorify mortal man be the main consideration? This is historically the \"done thing\" but I feel sadness this is the norm.This opinion may upset some, and I apologise for doing so. But, I do acknowledge Westminster is a beautiful building well worth visiting. I just didn't feel the same joy or warmth as I did in Salisbury Cathedral. Sorry."

That said, it is also an overcrowded tourist attraction that can be hard to appreciate as a church full of history with so many other people. Admission is also quite expensive.This was my second time going, and I'm honestly not sure I needed to go again. There were long lines, and once inside it was hard to stand to look at anything for more than a couple of seconds because of the constant push of people. The free audio-guide is good and gives you some of the highlights, but again, it's hard to use it when you're being rushed along by a steady stream of visitors. There is no photography allowed, which makes sense as it is already so crowded with people looking at things, but sometimes you wish you had the opportunity to snap a shot as the postcard collection in the shop leaves something to be desired.If you can get here during an off-peak time I think you will have a much better experience."

It was a rainy day and so I got wet `cause there was a line to get into the abbey...which was breathtaking. the building, the tombs, the detail...It was truly grandiose and I`m so glad I went. I like the fact the not only people of faith were honored in the abbey. You see writers and musicians memorialized, just about any one who has had a huge impact in the English society irrespective of origin. Saw the tombs of Queen Elizabeth I and Mary I (which by the way are together), Tomb of Mary, Queen of the Scots..The Abbey is huge,with so much crammed in and really beautiful so it takes a while to go through. Saw the coronation chair too! The guys in red/green jackets are really nice. They had locked up the chapel earlier than planned and one of them, Ed opened it up for me and helped me with pictures!! How nice.Helpful tips (I hope);1. Costs 20 pounds, which I believe is excessive.2. Comfortable footwear especially if you`re the sort to take in everything, is a must.3. Audio-guides are provided and are free4. Your can get a tour guide for an extra five pounds.5. Pictures aren`t permitted except in the chapel house.6. Last entry is 16:00hrs"

I didn't read up a lot on Westminster Abbey before going, and I was expecting just another cathedral. However, it was more like an indoor cemetery than a church, with centuries of kings, queens, scientists, mathematicians, and poets entombed in the floors and walls! Seeing the stones with the engravings so old they've been worn almost completely off was humbling. Some engravings were surprisingly well-preserved; even some in Latin and Old English. The \"free\" (\u00a320 entry fee) audio-guide was easy to use and did a good job of explaining key points.I'm conflicted about the \"no picture\" policy. On one hand, I would've loved to take some pictures, since this ended up being my favorite attraction in London!

It costs \u00a320 per person to enter. We made our visit on a 2 for 1 entry with our rail ticket. Presumably the London Pass would include some kind of deal for Overseas visitors. As a general tourist without using any special deals, I think the entrance fee is exhorbitant. I realise upkeep is enormous, and I don't think the Abbey gets any kind of Govt subsidy. You can of course attend the services for free. Having said the above, it truly is worth a visit.P"

My recommendation would be to attend a service because you get to take in all it's beauty without it being completely overtaken by tourists. We attended an evensong service, which is a service of which the majority is sung by the choir. It was free to attend, beautiful to hear the choir sing, and a good chance just to sit down and take in the sights. I believe the evensong services during the week are around 5pm. We went on a Saturday, and the evensong service was at 3 pm. We arrived around 2:45 pm and had no problem getting a seat. Not sure if that is the case all of the time. Check the website for times of all of the different services."

We got there around 10:00 a.m. and there was already a long queue, though it moved rapidly. If you want a really good seat, though, get there about 45 minutes to an hour ahead. Some folks who queued up after us weren't able to get a seat (though they did allow them to stand). The choir and Kingston Brass were amazing in that setting. It's about a 1.5 hour service. PLEASE, if your children have difficulty sitting through a church service at home, DO NOT believe for a minute that they will miraculously behave during this service! Leave them with a sitter and do not ruin the experience for others."

He wanted to visit Westminster Abbey, so we obliged.Booked tickets online. \u00a340 for 3 of us. I'm so glad we had booked online, as when we arrived around 9.40am the queue for entry was huge. Thankfully, as we'd booked online, we skipped the queue.As a huge Princess Diana fan I was looking forward to being in the Abbey where her funeral had been, and where Prince William got married.We were given audio equipment to listen to which pointed out the chapels, where Queens & Kings crypts were etc. I found it very interesting, as did our son.Seeing the altar where Queen Elizabeth was crowned & the Coronation chair were fab. And the tomb of the unknown soldier.I lit a candle for a loved one & also added a colleagues name to the prayer list, as he's suffering from cancer, I thought it lovely that we were able to do this.The Abbey is much bigger than it looks & we spent a couple of hours touring it.Visited the shop afterwards, which wasn't overpriced. I felt initially \u00a340 to tour a church was a bit much, but having been, felt the atmosphere & seen so much history, yes, I do think the cost was justified. All the money the take from sightseers is what maintains the Abbey & pays the guides to tell us all the interesting history of the Abbey. I felt humbled as I left the Abbey. Having been where sad, happy & world changing events have taken place.Highly recommend a visit here. The only thing I was slightly annoyed at, was the ban on photography inside the Abbey. Especially as in the Basilica we were able to take pictures. "

The details I could have stared at all day and I am not a history nor architecture buff! I was surprised of its location. It was there long before the hustle and bustle of the city surrounded it so its right on the main street with cars and pedestrian traffic zooming by.

Inside, the crowds were thick and we were ushered through our tour rather quickly, which is understandable with so many visitors trying to pass through. We loved seeing sections of the original floor tiles...worn but still beautiful. Stained glass, elaborate statues, paintings adorn the walls, corridors and altars. The property oozes royal history and houses the tombs of many of GB's Kings and Queens. Also memorialized and buried with the walls are authors, poets and notable historical figures. I love the sense of humor of our British friends - burying Queen Elizabeth I alongside her cousin/half sister, Mary Queen of Scott's.

Effectively for an extra \u00a37 we got the services of the excellent and entertaining Robert for a more witty and personalized tour of the Abbey.If you want the whose who of literature, Science, politics, they are all here. Best still the tombs of my favourite monarchs such as Henry V, Edward, Elizabeth 1, etc etc etc. The coronation chair and the ceiling are worth entry alone. Yes, it gets busy but as you pass through each part, with a fantastic tour guide, you felt so engrossed in the rich history you didn't notice anyone else around. In particular Robert reduced many to tears while reciting \"In Flanders Fields\" in front of the tomb to the Unknown Warrior from WW1, very moving. Just looking up, to the lofty ceiling, was a joy. I know it's expensive but it's worth doing, better with a guide so if they do tours while you are there pay extra, you get so much more. The only annoying thing is after the walk you are not allowed to wander freely as you've paid \"group rate\" - an entire \u00a33 discount!

It is home to the remains of many Kings, Queens, Poets, Writers, Nobility and many others. I appreciate being able to see the graves of say Richard II or Mary Queen of Scots but it also saddened me to see a church functioning more as a beautiful palace for the dead than a house of the Lord.

Of course, you'll get to see the exact place where they crown the Kings and Queens up to the latest one, Queen Elizabeth.

The guide's audience, mostly young, knew exactly what he meant. They loved it.Gossip. This was bringing history alive in a way that might have been unexpected in a great cathedral.

Names like Churchill, Darwin, Chaucer and the like are resting at WA. The cloisters at the end of tour are also worthy of viewing. Each has its own story.

At one point I found myself next to the tomb of Sir Isaac Newton - an unexpected surprise. The Gothic architecture of the building is what makes it so very special, the soaring vaulted ceiling a particular highlight for me.

We arrived 45 mins before the service, and were able to sit relatively near to the front, which was great. The service lasted an hour and a half, and was extremely well organised and put together, with plenty of information in the order of service to help anyone who wasn't familiar with the order of the ceremony. The stewards were friendly and helpful. The music was outstanding, and the visit was worth it if for nothing but that. We didn't get to take any photos or get much of a look around, but we weren't there to be tourists - to be noted by anyone that wants to do the same!"

We used the handset guides which were most useful both with the route and additional information. A beautiful building with magnificent architecture. Wonderful decoration in the side chapels and interesting tombs and memorials of monarchs, prime ministers, poets, composers, writers and more. As they were preparing for evensong at 5pm we felt we were a little rushed at the end and they were shutting doors on the chapels and we missed out on the tomb of Elizabeth I. It was busy as we passed it earlier and intended to return as we had to pass by it again. However, the door was slammed in front of us and we were told, by a hard faced lady in a red gown, that we were too late and we could not go in. We thought this a bit harsh since there was no one else behind us wanting to go in and 2minutes would not have made any difference to the running of the Abbey. We did not argue but as a Christian myself I did not think this reflected Christian values. Had we known that we would be so rushed we would have arrived 15 minutes earlier. One benefit of being in the Abbey at this time was being treated to the wonderful singing by the choir.Generally a very special building and well worth the cost of the entry."

Great photo ops of the London Eye and Big Ben.During our visit there was a war memorial display of thousands of tiny crosses and flags all over the grounds.Even if you can't get inside it's a wonderful exerience."

On arrival, we walked straight in ahead of a line approximately 300 metres long! We paid \u00a35 for the verger tour and spent almost two hours being shown around by a cheerful and incredibly informative verger, and when we later did the audio tour on our own, we realised she had shown and explained almost everything we were hearing on the audio tour! During our visit,there was a minute's silence for the people of Belgium after the bombings, and the entire Abbey was completely silent. A true sign of respect. This Church has such an intimate feel despite the numbers passing through each day. It might be physically a bit chilly, but the warmth that eminates from it is very special. I found Westminster Abbey a highlight of our trip and would recommend it to anyone as a must see!"

Useful to listen in to the guides alongside the handheld audio guides provided. Disappointing not to be able to enter the Edward I area but I guess understandable due to it's frail condition. Plenty to keep visitors occupied for at least two or three hours. Certainly learnt a great deal in a relatively short space of time. Restaurant and snack bar is available in the Abbey. Seemed reasonably priced for London. Would have liked to have seen more of the restoration activity being performed in the older part of the Abbey."

We did it as a London Walks tour which I highly recommend. There is an audio guide but I find those boring. The church is quite large and there is so much history. Neither of us are overly religious but this is more of a historical building than solely a religious center. You get to see where famous people are buried or memorialized. I went to see Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots and was not disappointed. The memorial for the unknown soldier is also very moving. It was also interesting to see the coronation chair and where coronations take place and how they add scaffolding for more seats. It was also interesting to see the progression of the church and when new areas where added on."

You could easily spend a full day in here, there's so much history to see. See where the coronation of the monarchs of England takes place, take in the splendour of the architecture of the building, and view the resting places of numerous people, including former kings and queens, poets, authors, actors and actresses. I spent a good couple of hours walking around and only left because the Abbey was closing, sadly there's no photography allowed inside but well worth a visit."

You can also get quite close to the throne in which the monarchs were seated while being crowned. This is the final resting place of many of the kings and queens we read about in our history books.

I tend to visit every five years or so to see if anything has changed. The beauty of the Abbey is that in a dynamic city like London very little does change inside. The highlights for me are as follows: the tomb of Edward the Confessor, for whom the Abbey was founded. He died nearly a thousand years ago; the sword of King George VI, which is really his only memorial in the Abbey, and the beautiful sparse Chapter House. If you want to start ticking off resting places of monarchs, then this place is a good start: the remains of Elizabeth I, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, Henry V, Henry VII, James I, Edward III, Richard II and Edward VI are all here. Just as impressive is an understated little door near the entrance to the Chapter House, which bears a plaque stating that it is 'The Oldest Door in Britain'. It was installed in the year 1050. do not miss the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, which is quite a humbling thing, and the Coronation Chair. Chaucer is here. There is a constellation of poets. And finally, do not miss Thomas Parr - 'Old Parr'."

He had said that no one walked over him when he was alive and they werent going to do it when he was dead!So many influencial people buried or remembered here, blink and you will miss something.We went on a quiet day, but stil lots of people here, but I can imagine the Abbey can get pretty congested on a busy Summers day so may be best to get here early on.There is so much to see if you are interested in British history, that you will need up to 3 hours to take it all in in.There is a very nice coffee shop/restaurant to visit after you have visited the cloisters.

We were there for just over 2 hours, so for most people you would need 1-2 hours for your visit."

Luckily the college garden was open and I could take a stroll through the very nice and quaint little garden.

Towards the end of the tour is the Poet's corner where famous poets, authors and composers are buried. Not to be missed. For me the highlight was seeing yhe tomb of Queen Elizabeth I. I highly recommend going to tour the Westminster Abbey. One FYI - I bought our tickets online thinking that doing this saves me from queuing at the ticket buying line. I was mistaken - still needed to go in the ticket buying line because the online ticket needed to be scanned by the person selling the tickets.

As well as the main Abbey there are other things to see such as the small gardens and cloisters.

As we arrived just after 9:30 (opening time) in February, there is absolutely no line to enter into the Abbey, and it remained quite spacious even in the smallest chapels, which is always nice. Hence, early morning (like every other top attraction) is by far the best time to visit the abbey. You enter through the Northern entrance (not the main entrance).Westminister Abbey has been the place for grand English ceremonies in the past, and it certainly shows in architecture. The gift shop seems to emphasise this with multiple pieces on the Queen's coronation and the royal wedding. My personal favourite part of the church is the Lady Chapel (Henry VII Chapel) with one of the best ceilings in the world, and the tomb of Elizabeth I.The Jeremy Irons audio guide (both downloadable or free with entrance) is one of the best I've used in Europe. Not too dull, so you can absorb all the information about the monarch of England (with its turbulent history), other important Englishmen buried here, and the grand architecture. The only small letdown is no photos (even without flash), but that's understandable. We spent just under 2 hours in the Abbey, and it is definitely my favourite church and attraction in London."

The Service of Choral Evensong has taken place at Westminster Abbey, at 5.00 pm every day for the last several hundred years, and it is a very special occasion.We arrived at around 4.30 pm to ensure that we had a good seat, and we found ourselves on the edge of the Quire itself, with a wonderful view of the Altar and of the almost incredibly impressive ceiling of the Abbey.At 5.00 pm, prompt, the sound of quiet chanting, in Latin, can be heard, getting gradually louder as the Choir makes it's way up the Nave to the Quire, where the Choir take their places for the Service.It is an almost mystical experience.It is easy to follow the Service from the sheet provided to each visitor, although some of the tunes are sung in Latin.The quality of the singing is superb; the choir is VERY professional and effective, and the sound of their voices seems to lift up to the wonderful ceiling above.There is time for quiet contemplation and prayer, and we stopped to pay our respects at the tomb of the unknown soldier as we returned down the Nave at the end of the Service.Although there is an Entrance fee for visiting the Abbey during the day, Entrance, together with the programme for Evensong at 5.00 pm, is absolutely free of charge, making this about the best value of any visitor event in the whole of London! They don't even pass a plate for a collection round at Evenson, so I put some money in the box for donations near the main door.Altogether, I thought that this was a fabulously uplifting experience, and I still find it hard to understand how such a magnificent place was built, using the basic technology which architects and builders had at the time.Just go to Westminster Abbey, stand in the Nave and look up at the stained glass windows and that fabulous ceiling/roof, and MARVEL that man has made such a wonderful and fitting tribute to our Loving Lord and Father."

At first I was put off by the steep admission price to enter the Abbey, but after spending several minutes inside studying the art, architecture and tombs, I realized the price was money well spent. The Abbey is maintained extremely well and provides a treasure trove of history. I had no idea it also serves as a mausoleum of sorts housing the remains of some of England's most well known historical figures. The chapels are incredible, particularity the Henry VII chapel with it's beautifully intricate ceiling to colorful banners hanging down the aisles. I spent a good amount of time here and would go back in a heartbeat. The only downside is that photography is banned inside (which is bittersweet and fairly typical of other churches in London)."

But I haven't been to that many of the famous attractions for some time, due to one factor - crowds.But in mid-2014 my wife and I decide to do a London Walk, having enjoyed many Paris Walks (while in France, obviously) and as we were staying near Trafalgar Square and we'd always wanted to see Westminster Abbey we chose a tour of the Abbey.It was fabulous. The crowds were there but being with a group we didn't have to queue and the guide was amazingly knowledgeable. If we'd gone there ourselves we'd have shuffled around and looked at this amazing building but not really known what we were seeing.As it was we heard about the unknown soldier, Edward the Confessor, seen where the queen sits, heard about the royal weddings there, seen the old throne, heard about monks being flayed alive and nailed to a door (not such a nice story but fascinating) and so on.It's an amazing building packed to the gunnels with history and still much used by the nobility and the famous today - and when you do go I strongly recommend getting a great guide like we had."

While were not there early enough to sit in the choir, by all means try to sit here if you can to just absorb the sacred space and moving sound of the choir itself, it was still a peaceful respite after a day of touring. When my 9 year old heard the choir, he assumed it was a CD \u2013 like those that his father listens to \u2013 and was blown away when he realize it was live singers filling the space. After the service, we were able to walk past the Cosmoti Pavement and through the choir and as we left, the Dean of Westminster Abbey wished us well. You cannot tour during or after service. The next morning we arrived early and queued up on the North side of the church. We were among the first 20 to enter the church and immediately asked how to get the tomb of St. Edward, the King who built this church. We were told it was an additional 5 pounds, and I was willing to pay, but when I asked a red-caped docent, he immediately brought our family there. It was especially moving as there are many Edwards in our family, and with reverence and awe of all the pilgrims before us, the docent afforded us the privilege of praying in one of the niches under St. Edward the Confessor\u2019s tomb. For us, this church and the tomb were the highlight of our trip. My advice, go early and take it all in. The audio tour is very informative \u2013 better yet, if going with kids, view one of the BBC\u2019s documentaries beforehand (on YouTube) and the significance of this place will resonate more with them (and you). Don\u2019t forget to walk in the cloisters on the way out and be sure to take a peak at Kind Edward\u2019s coronation chair, on the left, just before you exit at the front of the church."

I easily passed a couple of hours in here and found the audio commentary very interesting. The staff were also very approachable and informative about the Abbey. I sat in the garden for a while as the weather was so beautiful and it is hard to believe that it is in the centre of a capital city, right next to parliament.My only gripe is that photography is not allowed inside the building.

I had the privilege of meeting Jenny Petersen who originates from Melbourne and she is the real face of the Abbey. She was friendly, informative and clearly adores her calling in life. A real ambassador for the Abbey. She did the call to prayer on the hour where they ask people to stand still and pause for a quiet moment of reflection and prayer. It was pitiful how few stood still.She then held a short 5 minute service of prayer inside the Edward the Confessor chapel which was lovely.I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Abbey and it is wonderful to walk around and see where such momentous occasions have taken place over the years."

Even as a non-religious person, this place was probably my favorite stop while we were in London. The history, the architecture...simply amazing. If you have never been, do yourself a favor and check it out!"

You can do the listening tour where you hold your own little radio that explains different spot in the Cathedral for free. You are not allowed to take photographs inside at all. Also and I have to say this STOP TOUCHING EVERYTHING INSIDE. It's history you can't remake these things I don't care how tempting it is there are signs everywhere to not touch and the amount of times I saw people rubbing and poking things.

The tombs, graves, inscriptions, stained glass windows and age old flags and standards are unique and priceless (if you can use that word). The Abbey is basically an age old burial site/ gave yard.

We loved walking down the isle that Will and Kate walked down on their wedding day. The cloisters were fun to explore, and we learned so much about royal history while we were here.

There is also a service at 12:30pm during the week, so either go earlier or later if you want to avoid it. However, communion is open to those who wish to partake. You can also write a prayer request and light a candle once inside. (No charge.)On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday you can also visit the gardens.

If you don't know who all the people are, take a notebook and google them afterwards. The same applies to the monuments and memorials in Poets Corner, and the transept full of long-gone philanthropists and politicians. If you're lucky enough to be there for Matins, the choir is one of the best anywhere. And when the Choir School is on holiday (well, they're only boys) other good choirs fill in. Google beforehand to see what music you might be lucky enough to hear. Don't rush this, and don't think of yourself as box-ticking tourist.

Incorpating architectural styles from Norman through high Gothic, it includes stunning memorials to some England's most famous and interesting monarchs. Also the graves of or memorials to many famous and interesting Britons. The graves of a plethora of monarchs are here: including (but not limited to): Henry III, V and VII; Edward (besides St. Edward the Confessor), I, III, V, and VI; Richard II;Mary Queen of Scots (ok, not a monarch, but still), Mary I & II, and Elizabeth I, James I (VI of Scotland), Charles II, William III (II of Scotland), George II... The graves or memorials of poets and writers. Alphabetically: W. H. Auden, William Blake, Robert Burns, Lord Byron, Lewis Caroll, Charles Dickens, John Dryden, George Eliot, T. S. Eliot, Thomas Gray, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Samuel Johnson, John Keats, Rudyard Kipling, Jenny Lind, John Masefield, John Milton, Laurence Olivier, Alexander Pope, Nicholas Rowe, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Thomas Shadwell, William Shakespeare, Alfred Lord Tennyson and William Wordsworth. And others. Not to mention scientists: Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin., along with a memorial to Michael Faraday. Plus many other famous Britons. It contains memorials in addition to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Martin Luther King, Jr. (interesting to us as Americans), plus a memorial paid for by the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It is also a working church and cathedral. A moment of silence is held hourly in a refreshing and humble manner. Of course, services are also held daily.Westminster Abbey is an almost ridiculously magnificent and interesting place.

The audio guide was a bit of a let down, considering all the tombs and monuments in the place and the architecture of the building there were only 15 stops on it and you didn't get much information for each one. Despite all of the above, the building is still a magnificent one and should be seen at least once. Only minutes from Westminster tube station, it's only open from 9,30 am until 3.30pm so arrive early, no photos are allowed inside the Abbey either."

The service was lovely, and the atmosphere inspiring, but some of the visitors were not.Please, don\u2019t attend a worship service if you have no intention of worshipping \u2013 it\u2019s disrespectful. (The teenage boys across from me who were snickering, whispering with one another, and shrugging their shoulders were obviously not told by their tour guide how to behave in this setting. My advice is to follow the service in the booklet \u2013 even if that\u2019s not something you do at home. It is always best to err on the side of politesse.) And please, please, don\u2019t bring toddlers to an event you wouldn\u2019t expect them to sit quietly through at home. This is an experience not to be missed, and you can find out when it is offered by visiting the website or the church itself.

I would sincerely recommend doing the guided tour - you get access to areas the general public don't which is fabulous for only 7 pounds extra not to mention extra history and information you just do not get in the audio guide. I had just missed the start of the tour by 5mins and was poorly advised that the audio guide provided the same information. WRONG. After 30mins of self touring, I was able to overhear and catch up on the English tour (which was obviously much better informed about each of the areas) and after asking the guide if I could join, I was able to run back to the start, buy a ticket and join them almost halfway through. Staff not helpful, guided tours great, audio guide very average. Watch out for big groups of tours going through at the same time it can get quite crowded."

My wife and I have wanted to visit here for a long time and yesterday we took the train down to London..a 2 hour journey..to do exactly that.We prebooked our tickets on line which if the Abbey is likely to be busy is probably a great idea and even though it is the off season there were still quite a few visitors around.Ours were \u00a315 each which on booking we thought was expensive but in reality was well worth the expense.We opted for a guided tour by one of the cannon/verges..not your normal type of guide but a member of the \"church community\".This was a further \u00a35 each but was more than worth the cost.They only take these tours in English but will take up to 20 people apparently but surprisingly there were just the two of us on ours which made it a very personal for us.David who took us around was a excellent, full of knowledge but also very down to earth and with a great sense of humour.This lasted around 100 minutes and whilst he can't possibly show you everything,there is so much to see, we felt we had got through a lot in the time but at a nice pace with nothing rushed.There are audio tour facilities which many obviously took up.We decided to stay for the Evensong service which took place at 3 pm and lasted around 50 minutes.The Abbey choir sang at the service and were joyous to listen to.An added bonus and totally unexpected was When David found out we were attending this we were found seats in the area where the choir sit and during important services the members of the royal family etc sit.I'm sure this isn't always available but was a major treat for us.Would we go back again...we still had a lot to see..well of course we would.The only thing I would warn people is not to leave it late to go and try to establish the service times as I believe the Abbey will close to visitors during these times but equally if you are happy to join the service then everyone can provided of course you remain for the whole of it and respect the fact it is a period of worship."

The queue was excessive, but it moved quite fast so don't be off-put by that. You won't be waiting long. Downers about Westminster Abbey would be that you can't take photographs/videos, that they're sticklers about following the provided routes, and half the staff looks unapproachable (and some actually ARE rude). You can read and see only too much here. Highlights for me would be the Queen Mary and Elizabeth I room (for obvious reasons) and St John the Baptist's Chapel (because the monument on the right is missing a nose, making it look like Voldemort). Overall, great experience. Don't pooh-pooh the spots at the end either because you'll get great photos there since it's not \"in the church.\""

I was moved by the commemorations to politicians, scientists, artists and military men. Even old Charlie Darwin gets a mention in the nation's leading house of God. I bet that wouldn't please the Oxford professor of evolutionary biology (not Darwin himself, guess who). Joking aside, I enjoyed it very much. Recommend finishing with the Chapter House, a place of simple beauty after the overwhelming clutter.Cafe is okay, with very pleasant staff.Main criticism: despite the cost of upkeep a \u00a320 admission fee for adults is unacceptable. Furthermore, in 2015 it was \u00a318. My dodgy maths makes that a just over 11% increase. Let's not forget money is also being made from cafe, shop and sites around the building soliciting donations.

We were pulled out the back of the queue by a large and formidable security guard who took us to the front even though there was an hour wait.Inside the huge abbey soars above you into a complex symmetry of arches and ceiling bosses. The light through the stained glass windows danced a million colours across the seats laid regimentally across the centre waiting for the next service. All around, liveried staff waited with natural smiles for questions from visitors from across the world.As one would expect, burials have been going on there for over 800 years and you will discover a wide-ranging spectrum of people. From lords, kings and queens, to poets, authors, scientists, composers, as well as previous clergy and dignitaries.The centrepiece is the tomb of the unknown soldier, carried back from Flanders Field and laid to rest beneath a black marble slab near the entrance. Permanently surrounded by poppies it is a place to stand for a moment and consider the pointlessness of war.On our visit we used the facilities which were excellent for disabled and able-bodied alike. I would recommend at least two hours to get a good look at all facets of this fantastic building as the architecture alone takes some time to realise it was put together block by block with nothing more than pure grunt without the benefit of hydraulic lifting gear, laser levels and machine tools."

And if I am being honest with myself it was because she and I woke early on the morning at the end of April a few years prior to watch the soon-to-be crowned Kate walk down the aisle to Price William. Although you enter from the side, instead of the bottom of the narthex, it is still breathtaking to walk in and be where so many have. The only downside is that pictures are prohibited, but that forces you to look closely all around you to capture in your mind all the incredible things you'll see. The pews, the crypts, the floor - it was all great. Don't skimp out on getting a radio/walkie talkie-thing. Those were invaluable to our visit."

We were warmly welcomed to our seat in the front row and had the pleasure of a full view of the abbey choir. For a blissful hour we were peacefully transported by the voices of angels to a higher place. We had taken time out of our busy travel schedule to sit and reflect on our blessings, all our wonderful travel experiences, to simply sit, enjoy and be grateful. I even had the pleasure, before the ceremony, of a pleasant conversation with a delightful young local who was also there to worship. Taking in the sights and sounds around us during Evensong was a special and fitting way to experience Westminster Abbey"

The thing that really narks me is that this is supposed to be a holy place of worship but it hugely misses the point of being a Church, in my opinion. Sure, there are some famous kings buried here, but it's meant to be about God, not people who were friends of the royals hundreds of years ago. Maybe I'm being overly harsh; I don't know. I just feel other cathedrals are more welcoming. There was a really short prayer for people who have passed on that we love, but I thought it could have been more substantial. I did like the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. I would like to attend one of the services in future. Maybe that would make more sense to me. Thanks for having us, and Christ be with you always."

You can also see the burial place for Darwin and the Unknown Soldier. The Abbey is a magnificent piece of architecture and the artistry is amazing. I would recommend this over many of the tours in London. You can do this at your own pace and get lost in a world that existed hundreds of years ago. This is also where all the coronations have taken place, where the funeral of Princess Diana occurred, and where Will & Kate got married.

We found this room to the side that was wide and sort of round, with old painted panels in between each wall angle. One panel showed a \"dromadery\" with the word written next to it--a teaching moment for medieval era big wigs (but little-travelled?) sitting in the room."

It's historic and lots of notable people are buried or at least have memorials there. But at the end of the day, it's not Disneyland -- it's a functioning cathedral, just like all the other functioning cathedrals one will encounter in many parts of Europe and around the world. What that means is people seem to have a different notion of what they will see there and go at great lengths to see it, which results in lots of big tourist groups, lots and lots of kids (who have very little interest in being in a cathedral), and long lines to get in during busy times of the day. In my opinion, the best way to see this iconic site without killing too much of the day is to a) read up on the Abbey before visiting, b) go either very early in the day or at the very end of the day, and c) budget no more than about 45min-1hr there and move through it at a reasonable pace. The audio tour isn't that insightful, and the crowds are quite heavy so it's hard to really enjoy the 'serenity' which might otherwise be found in most cathedrals. About 90 minutes max (including waiting to get in, seeing everything, visiting the gift shop, etc.) is about all you need."

Apart from the extortionate cost, I was amazed at the degree of regimentation, verging on the bullying, and the lack of respect for its visitors. In this I include certain voluntary staff. I am aware that many are dedicated volunteers, without whom the establishment could not function. However, there are a small minority who seem to regard the donning of fancy dress as an opportunity to dominate others. Regrettably, I will not be returning, children do not seem to be welcome.

Very basic stuff - wikkipedia could tell you more.No photos allowed - change from our last visit and one of the only churches you can't take photos in in the UK. This would be fine if the price they charged wasn't so exorbitant and it wasn't advertised and priced as a tourist spot.Not enough historical informationNo mention of William Wilbourforce who was the driving force behind abolishment of the slave tradeNo mention of William Pitt the Prime Minister at the time - in fact his grave plaque is unreadable and hasn't been restored..... a disgrace really. Far too many staff standing around doing nothing (peering upon people waiting to catch them out doing something wrong - reminded me of being at a catholic primary school).We learnt nothing - many tombs with no signs/translation into English or any other language. Would we go again - NO.Would recommend trying to get a discount voucher as for 20 pounds per adult and an hour visit. If you have young children they will be bored there is nothing interactive or event at child height to read or look at. Viewing their annual report shows they are in no dire straights financially although this is the spiel is many responses to posts in trip advisor - infers that the entry is what it is to cover cost of running.To the management: If you read this it would be great if more was invested in the audi guide and history - people wouldn't mind paying as much if this was quality. For reference Churchill war rooms and Edinburgh castle audio tours are outstanding.Real consideration needs to be given to your pricing - if I was with a family it would have been simply unaffordable. Do you care - not sure, but you should.In summary if you are a visitor who cannot afford or so not see the value in paying you can go in at mass times for free, take some photos out the front and buy a historical book - you will learn more."

I absolutely treasured my time during this service. Sitting in this amazing place, listening to music, is a calming, peaceful experience. I felt great by the time the service was over. I headed into the gift store afterwards, they have beautiful cross necklaces for sale here.

We arrived at Westminister Abbey at about 13:50 (be sure to check hours of operations for Westminister as they change on the day and season). There are two entrances for visitors into Westminster, one for those who wish to pray (free, but you don\u2019t get to tour the full grounds) and the other for tourists to visit the whole abbey (admission 20GBP). The last admission into the abbey was at 14:00 (again, based on the day and season), however I would highly recommend coming around this time, there was almost no crowd (have I mentioned I can\u2019t stand crowds at museums?). The Abbey was absolutely breath-taking, even though we came close to closing time, we still had plenty of time to see the entire grounds. Audio-guides are offered for free giving a brief history of the highlights through the grounds. Service and prayer may be conducted during your visit, you may be asked for a moment of silence or have to go around the service to continue your tour (conversely, you can also stay and listen to the service). Be sure to see the Coronation Throne before exiting the Abbey (its over 700-years old)!"

The self-guided audio tour was fantastic and allowed me to choose which areas to focus on. The Abbey was not very crowded so the atmosphere was quiet and somewhat dark and mysterious. On the visit four days later, I spoke to some of the guards. One guard, Alex, told me he was at the Royal Wedding in 2011 and even told me to \"youtube\" the video that showed him standing next to Kate!

Yes this is one of those London sights (unlike so many) with a steep entry fee, but it is worth every penny. The Abbey helpers are extraordinarily friendly and knowledgeable. But the audio guide is one of the finest devised. The sublime voice of Jeremy Irons accompanies you on your tour, and the beautiful sounds of the Abbey choir are constant delights. It is a magnificent building, and surprisingly compact (unlike say, St Pauls). Architecturally stunning, the highlights include the choir, the altar, countless tombs, and the exquisite Henry VII Lady Chapel - the intricacy of the ceiling will take your breath away. As a museum it offers so much - endless graves and memorials to the famous. Your favourite English composer, writer, poet, actor etc is sure to be featured. Poet's Corner and the Shakespeare Memorial stand out. And outside the main body of the church, ensure to spend some time in the cloisters, the wonderful Chapter House, and the impressive gardens. A feast for all the senses."

The entrance is free and it was well worth the visit, since one gets to feel the real atmospere of the church. The stewards at the entrance weren't particularly polite, since they were trying to prevent the tourists from entering the church for sightseeing, so make sure to tell them that you only want to attend the service, not to visit the church, otherwise they won't let you in."

It is important to note that the opening hours are 9:30 \u2013 3:30 which means that this attraction closes much earlier than many of the other attractions in London so plan your visit accordingly. In addition, there is a fairly steep fee to visit so it is a good idea to get a London Pass or, if you are two, the 2 for 1 passes that are available at most train and tube stations. This pass literally cuts the cost of everything in half as it is taken pretty much everywhere. And the tube pass that goes along with it is a great deal too as the tube is by far the best way to travel longer distances in London. It is a great walking city if the weather permits.Westminster Abbey is well worth a visit as it is much more than \u201cjust a church.\u201d It provides a great look into more than a 1000 years of British history and it is not just about purely religious figures\u2026.on the contrary, information is provided about kings, queens, statesmen, military, and many famous writers/poets. The audio guide is very good although it is sometimes difficult to determine exactly where you are in reference to the dialogue on the guide.There is an option for guided tours but the day we were there, they did not seem to be available. We weren\u2019t interested but I happened to hear an upset patron. Should you be interested, I suggest you check exactly when these occur prior to your arrival.Note that if your time is short and you can only fit in one religious attraction, we were four people and we all preferred our visit to St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral."

Around 1050 Edward the Confessor ordered the construction of Westminster abbey and church on an older monastic site of uncertain date.Present day Westminster abbey is largely due to a reconstruction campaign initiated by Henry III from 1245 onward.Visitors can discover the church with the help of a free audio guide following a one way circuit. Sadly no photography is allowed inside the edifice. Church and abbey have great architectural interest. Highlights in this perspective include the thirteenth century Cosmati pavement in front of the high altar, the fourteenth century murals in the chapter house and the magnificent perpendicular chapel added by Henry VII.The church is particularly a must for history buffs given its use as a royal coronation and burial site. Although it is a significant plus to have some background about the deceased particularly the fifteenth and sixteenth century tombs are very ornate.The audio commentary was very interesting but I felt a lot more stories were left untold. I would therefore encourage the management to invest in extra audio tracks.Hint 1 : Online tickets come with a discount.Hint 2 : Check the opening times of the abbey online in advance as they differ each day.Hint 3 : Be aware that the shrine of Edward the Confessor can only be visited as part of a guided tour, to be inquired about in advance."

Even if you don't take a guided tour (we used Rick Steve's tour from his London book), you can learn a lot of history.

While listening to the audio tour, you will also hear the Charles Darwin and Issac Newton's tombs are located there as well. Pity I could find their tombs as there are so many around. The gothic architecture is intricate and very detailed - built from 200 years of contruction and rebuilding from the war. No interior photos to share as no photography is allowed inside. This is where you really need to enjoy with your naked eye - something your camera can't capture! Enjoy"

I'm posting a photo of their open-close hours (taken on 19th dec 2015) for your reference. Check on photo post.You can also take a walk (or you can take the tube) to the trafalgar square which is probably only 10-15 minutes away by foot, so does the Buckingham palace. So plan your day beforehand for efficiency. You can cramp a lot of place in a single day with westminster abbey. Hope these tips are useful."

To be quite honest, after nearly a week of paying not-so-inexpensive entrance fees to phenomenal, iconic cathedrals in the UK, I was hesitant to pay one more time for this phenomenal, iconic cathedral. I went ahead, because my family religious heritage includes the Anglican Communion. I am so glad I did. As I learned, it is no longer an abbey, nor a cathedral, but it is of enormous political and historical significance. It doesn't have the majestic reputation of St. Paul's Cathedral, which is not far away. But, British history comes alive inside the Abbey. It is the resting place of kings, queens, artists and other legendary historical figures. That alone is worth the price of admission. I knew that the Abbey is an active congregation, but I was a bit surprised when I, along with everyone else, was invited to participate in the liturgies going on while we were there. That's not for everyone, but I appreciated it. Yet, here is what clinched the whole experience for me: I spent most of my time looking up: at the architecture and epitaphs on countless burial markers. While I was looking up, I heard a woman behind me remark, \"I can't believe that HE is buried here.\" I looked down and found that I was standing on top of Charles Darwin. I haven't stopped telling that story yet, as you now know. Perhaps there are iconic structures you want to visit first, but don't miss out on a great, historical experience. Visit Westminster Abbey."

In my view, it is one of the most impressive buildings in the world. The vast amount of history that took place in this building is astounding. It is amazing how many famous people are buried here. And the architecture is beautiful. Go there, get the self guided tour, and experience a thousand years of British history."

I was a little taken aback that I had to pay for my visit each time I went, but it was well worth it. St Pauls has a system where you pay once, and can opt for an annual pass, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be available at Westminster Abbey. However, I was blown away by my visit.Every corner is crammed in with sculptures, tombs, plaques, etc., to the most famous of people and many kings and queens. I was particularly tickled given the history that we read, that Queen Elizabeth I is commemorated on top of Mary, her sister (I wonder what Elizabeth was trying to say with that act), and that just down the corridor, Mary Queen of Scots is commemorated \u2013 Mary and Elizabeth would probably be turning in their graves at that one. Also Queen Elizabeth's effigy was apparently modelled on her exact hands and face which is a bit spooky when you see her. \uf04a I took an audio tour \u2013 these are also available to download onto your phone through the Abbey website, but the free audio tour kit worked very well. I also took a guided tour. Unfortunately, our guide must have had a rather long day, as she was not very animated, and appeared to be stifling sighs of boredom all around. However, she did take us into Edward Confessors shrine which was incredible, and I felt extremely fortunate and honoured to be allowed in there, given it\u2019s age and what it\u2019s been through over the ages. That was very special indeed.I only managed to do half the audio tour before our main tour started, and unusually the person who guided our tour really didn\u2019t tell us much that we couldn\u2019t have found out on the audio tour, which from my experience is an exception to the rule.However, I wonder how many of the guided tours go into visit Edward, and also save us a seat in the quire for the evensong service \u2013 that was a major bonus.I will return in a few months\u2019 time, to complete the audio tour at a leisurely pace, in case anything was missed out on our guided tour.Evensong was ethereal whilst sitting in the quire. The choir boys and service were magical. I don\u2019t often go to church, but I think in future, that this will be my favourite service to attend if I feel the need. One could feel that it dated way back to around Henry VIII time and was just really, really special. Normally one has to queue outside the Abbey entrance until around 5.15pm and then be let in, once the Abbey has closed to the public. But since we were on the afternoon guided tour, we were tipped off to show our visitor wrist bands and stay in the Abbey to get to the front of the queue for the best seats for the service. If you want to sit in the quire, then you need to be at the front of the queue as it is first come first served.There was disabled access to most items, although the toilets are currently in a portacabin up some steps, so I\u2019m not sure how that would work for the disabled. There was a nice caf\u00e9/restaurant. The shop was a bit lacking I felt. I enjoyed the shop at St Pauls more \u2013 can\u2019t put a finger on why though\u2026.Can\u2019t wait to go back and explore more than just the main building \u2013 there is plenty there probably for the whole day if you take it slowly and soak it all in.Loved it."

This was by far the highlight of our trip to London and I would recommend that everyone visit here at least once in their lifetime. We bought our tickets online. They are for a specific day (of your choosing and based on availability), yet fortunately they are not time certain. This at least gave us some flexibility as to when we arrived. We walked over from the St. James' Underground Station. As we approached, we could see this magnificent building rise in front of us. It is truly magnificent and knowing some of the history and events that have taken place here over the years makes it even more incredible. They were in the middle of placing the small Poppy Crosses on the lawn for the Field of Remembrance. Over 100,000 would eventually be installed. It was a time for reflection looking at all of the names, units and countries represented. It was also very much a time to be thankful for their service and sacrifice. While photos are welcome outside, you are prohibited from taking photos inside the Abbey. While this was a disappointment, it is certainly understandable. We visited in early November on a Tuesday morning and arrived right about opening time. We had read about the 90 minute Verger Tour so we inquired and found spaces were available on an upcoming tour. We opted to wait about an hour. You can look around inside during this time or go back outside. The Verger Tour only cost an additional 5 GBP and was the best money we spent on our whole trip. There is a small food wagon set up near the entrance. Their coffee is really good (not too strong). As we entered, there was basically no wait (due to the time of year) and the security guard was inspecting bags. We showed out Verger Tour ticket and were directed to some chairs to wait in or we could look around until time for our tour. Our tour was small with about 10 people (it is limited to 20 maximum). We started at the west door and worked our way down the Abbey as you would see in a formal procession, all the while being informed of historical features and events. As an example, I did not know that the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior lies in the middle of the aisle inside the main entryway near the west door. The wooden Coronation Chair is also nearby. We were taken into the choir loft and allowed to sit while we were given more details on the construction and history of the Abbey. We proceeded down to the High Altar, up the wooden steps to the Chapel containing St Edward the Confessor's Shrine and where a total of five Kings and four Queens are buried, onto the Lady Chapel where Elizabeth 1 and Mary 1 are buried in the same tomb, nearby is the tomb of Mary, Queen of Scots among the burial places of many others, finally we ended the tour at Poet's Corner. After it was over, we were free to walk around more or simply sit and enjoy the Abbey. We opted to go to the Cellarium Caf\u00e9 for lunch. We both ordered the 8 oz Rib Eye with B\u00e9arnaise Sauce and it was the best steak we have had in quite a while. Perfectly cooked and very tasty. The menu is varied and alcoholic beverages are available. Restrooms (toilets) are nearby, as well as a small gift shop. The only negative of our whole experience was prior to our entry when we needed restroom facilities. We were directed to a large portable \"sanitation station' around back that was unisex as both men and women, including the construction workers who were using this facility. There was also what appeared to be an older male employee that appeared to be responsible for maintaining this facility, however he was more concerned about listening to the game that was being blasted on the radio than cleaning the facilities. The place was disgusting and wreaked of urine. Something desperately needs to be done about the facility conditions. So, if you can hold it and eat at the Cellarium, I recommend that you use those facilities. Otherwise, this was an amazing journey through time and I am grateful for the opportunity to check another big item off of my bucket list."

It is so full from top to bottom that it is hard to take it all in. However if you are interested in important people in UK history and beyond , it is certainly stunning. Admission is expensive and my consolation is that it's supporting the church in maintaining this pilgrimage site for so many. There is a cafe we weren't able to visit and nice shops we were. Apparently you can visit for free during services , but visitors at those times cannot tour the many tombs and memorials. Get there early as the line is long even then. The staff is friendly and helpful. You are able to wander and staff are available for questions and info in different spots."

You just follow the stops which correspond to audioguide and hear about the immense history of the abbey. I ended up spending about three hours in the abbey.

One of the most historically significant churches in the world, Westminster Abbey has been the site of many British monarch's coronation, wedding, and burials. Maybe that is why the admission price is so high: \u00a320 per adult.While the Gothic-style architecture was certainly impressive, it was not as unique as other impressive Gothic-style churches in Europe that are free to enter like the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris to justify the high price. Aside from its historical significance, I think the Abbey's selling point is that it's the burial site for not only the British royalty and aristocrats but also famous individuals like Issac Newton and Charles Darwin, so if you get fazed by cemeteries in general, this may not be your cup of tea. Otherwise, this is the place you will get as close to these notable figures without a time machine!I personally did not believe the church was worth the admission, as the exterior was more impressive and iconic than the interior. Unless you already have the London Pass, you can safely pass up going inside if you have and will be going to other churches in Europe.---tl;dr version:1) Impressive but not entirely unique architecture to justify high cost2) Burial site for many notable figures - good or bad depending on how you handle dead people"

As we had London Passes, we were able to gain express admission and thereby just walk straight in. At the entrance, we were issued with our audio guides for our self-guided tour. The audio guide takes the visitor to about 22 different points of interest inside the abbey and around its environs. Included in the points of interest are a number of small chapels which contain the tombs of various eminent people.The interior of the abbey is absolutely stunning. The audio guide provides a very good insight into the various points of interest. During our visit, many parts of the abbey were very crowded with people which made it a bit difficult to dwell in any one spot for too long. It may have been better to visit on a weekday rather than on the weekend.After we had completed our tour of the abbey, we visited the abbey\u2019s souvenir and gift shop which is located just next to the abbey.

Walk along the sanctuary and view the crypts, the artwork and styles of the past. This is an active church and services are still held so you are asked to be quiet but many talk softly. The floor tiles also cover crypts and you can names and dates marching back through time. This is my favorite in London and you get a real feel of the age of the monarchy just by walking the time-worn floor through the church. There is a gift shop just outside the doors. Impressive!"

It was still quite busy and we can't imagine being able to see much of the Abbey in peak tourist season. We also used the '2 for 1' discount eligible for National Rail travellers which made the visit much better value.The Abbey itself is just stunning and I loved being able to see the place I had seen so often broadcast for special royal occasions. It was also quite awe inspiring to see so many memorials and tombs. The free audio guide was also very helpful and I would recommend utilising it. We would highly recommend this site to those in the off season, even more so for those eligible for a discount. If you are a true history buff or of a faith persuasion I would say the entry fee is worth it. It is definitely not a cheap attraction but I understand why a church would have this entry fee in place."

Westiminster Abbey is not the most beautiful church in the world, but a visit to it is mandatory at least once in a lifetime, even if it is just to contemplate its beautiful architecture and huge nave.Visiting the place is more like visiting a mausoleum for the monarchy and very important people. Of course it still have regular services and masses, but the great highlight for the tourists is the history behind (or should I say below) its foundations. The place serves as a tomb for several kings, queens and member of the monarchy. The good part is that they offer a free audio guide, and without it, your visit will be somewhat boring, unless you just want to see where the Royal Members get married or get their coronation."

First, it costs quite a bit to enter, so it's not a pop in, pop out attraction or one to which you would return, unless it was for Evensong or for another service. It should be said that you never have to pay to worship here. Second, there are a LOT of people, so the visit is very organized. You will have a difficult time just wandering about unless you want to say \"excuse me\" a lot and be in the way. The audioguide is a must to get the most out of the place, and it will guide you through. You'll fall in with the parade of visitors who step over and around (and sometimes sadly on) the graves and memorials of many a famous person. The guide will help you identify these people as well as explain the history of the building and the chapels that you will see. Given the crowds and the volume of things to see, this is not a site to squeeze into your itinerary. Leave enough time. In spite of the guided visit, they have done a good job of keeping the church a church rather than converting it into a museum or tourist attraction. Most people are respectful about the noise level, and every 30 minutes or so, there is an invitation to stop for prayer. As well, regular services such as the noon eucharist DO go on, and you can attend easily. If you are visiting this place as a baptized Christian or if you have an interest in the Christian faith, I would highly recommend participation. There are also clergy and lay ministers available for prayer or to talk with about spiritual matters and concerns simply for the asking. London is chock full of attractions, but I would recommend taking your time here, not only to make the most of your tour but to take advantage of the spiritual resources available at the Abbey. Amos, while the church visit takes a long time,the peace of the cloisters is not to be missed."

The entry ticket includes a free audio guide, although you could also pay 5 pounds for a 60-90min guided tour (which I did and thought was informative, as I didn't have the patience to listen through audioguide). The church didn't feel as vast I had envisaged. Sure, the nave has a tall ceiling, but the length of it is broken by the Quire, which splits it into two sections, as far as the viewer on the ground was concerned. Unfortunately they didn't let us take photos, which I never understood why (St Peter's Basilica, a far more spectacular and significant church, allows photography indoors). Also, the outside isn't particularly impressive. Nevertheless, it's worth a visit simply for all the history within its walls."

At this time of year you are greeted outside by the poppies laid in Remembrance, its worth taking a few minutes to look at these and remember the fallen.The queue also wasn't too long, only about 5 minutes wait however, that did include people bailing out of the queue - don't know why.The entrance fee is \u00a320 per person, we used 2 for 1 which made it better value but you do need to download the voucher and show network rail tickets so its not available if you are a tourist staying in London (not the Abbey's fault). The audio guide is very informative and, of course, included in the price. If the Abbey wasn't included in the 2 for 1 we wouldn't have gone; \u00a320 pp is a bit steep.Photography is restricted, there are areas outside of the main Abbey where photos are allowed.Currently the museum is closed as it is going to be re-sited, we couldn't find the caf\u00e9 and the toilets have been moved outside to a Port-a-Cabin (there was an enormous queue of young school kids waiting to use it - lucky it wasn't raining at the time!) The College Garden is only open three days in the middle of the week so we couldn't see that either. My gripe here is that we paid the same as when the Abbey was fully up and running, yet not all the facilities were available to us.The tour route is well thought out and the commentary, as before, is informative. We'd just missed one of the guided tours so I'd suggest that you look at their website and time your visit as I'm sure the guides are very good from what we overheard.We'll probably go back in a few years to see the new museum but will use 2 for 1 again."

My whinge is not with the 20 pound entry fee but with the absurd obsession of the docents and staff who seem to spend most of their time in this place of reverence shouting at people enforcing the \"no picture\" rule. I understand the no selfie stick rule common in museums, I understand the no-flash rule. but no pictures at all why? there is probably not a single artifact in the Abbey that is not findable on the web so copyright is not an issue, and no flash imagery wont damage anything so whats the problem? My pictures are generally personal, moments of memory or experience which cannot be found in stock photography. We visited a day or two after memorial day, I was lectured aggressively by a grey cassocked employee when I tried to take a picture of two quite venerable ladies holding hands and looking down at the poppy adorned memorial to the unknown soldier and sharing some ancient memory. Later a white haired docent became quite histrionic when she caught me reading! my iPhone as I uncovered the background of the relatively new stained glass window in Poets Corner. She thought I was taking pictures. My final dressing down came in QE 1's mausoleum when I tried to document the lack of hands on the little metal statues that are mounted on fence around her place of rest. I asked a couple of the docents.. the best they could come up with is that the \"dean forbids it\". It really is silly though, in the current world taking pictures is part of life and of the social world in which we live, leave the signs up just please stop screaming at people just because they want to document some personal moment in a placed steeped in history"

This in fact was NOT the case when I booked. As a frequent traveler, I am very careful when booking anything and this is one important detail I would NOT have overlooked. Additionally, when I pressed the representative to please reconsider providing a refund, I was ignored completely. It' s a shame that this is the experience that will stick with me whenever I think of Westminster Abbey. I am sure the inside is lovely and well worth the visit, but sadly I will never know and can say that their customer service is lacking!!!!!"

I realize many of those who show up during services are there to be tourists and not worshippers, but it's still a church and you really never know why someone walks in the great west doors. My tip is to visit the cloisters, which is free and barely visited by the thousands who pay to see the interior of the abbey."

Kate and William also got married here in the Abbey. behind the Abbey, has a huge garden, little museum and a british oldest door. this place is huge and worth a visit."

There is an audioguide included with the entry, and it's narrated by Jeremy Irons who is suited perfectly for the job. I wished I could take pictures inside, because the Abbey is filled to the brim with wonderful things I wanted to remember.Sunday morning service was less crowded and absolutely fantastic. By a stroke of luck, my friend and I were ushered to sit directly behind the choir. The hour-long service was almost entirely sung and simply gorgeous."

Recently, I went back on a Sunday for Choral Communion. Unlike many other big churches/cathedrals it reserves Sunday entirely for worship and both the building is closed to tourists and also the shop outside. This creates an absolute oasis of serenity minus mobile phones, selfie sticks and all the rigmarole of tourist life. Even when the fabulous boy choristers are on holiday the adult men put up a fine vocal performance the lifts the spirits. Hats off to the Abbey for keeping Sunday special"

As this is a working church, visitors are not allowed to take photos, but to be quite honest it was so busy during our visit, it would have been difficult to get good photos anyway. We enjoyed listening to the audio guide while touring around. There is of course, several gift shops on the grounds so visitors can purchase both religious type goods and London souvenirs.

After watching the royal wedding a few years ago it was wonderful to be able to see in person this stunningly beautiful and historic church. We visited with a private guide and it was great to go with a local who knows the church so well. The architectural and details are a sight to behold, and as a working church it was just lovely to be asked to stop for a moment at 10 am for a prayer -- a regular occurence deserving of respect and courtesy. Take your time here - there are members of the royal family interred here, as well as Britains unmarked grave for the unknown soldier. Great names are memorialized here and some buried here. An interesting tidbit -- the scene in the DaVinci code at the memorial to Sir Isaac Newton was not in fact filmed here (photography is not allowed inside the church) but in the cathedral at Lincolnshire. Walk the cloisters and read the names of those who came before us. It is moving. We caught a climpse of young students of the Westminster Boys Choir, who board and are schooled on the abbey grounds. It was neat to see them in their uniforms and cloaks. If you have questions there are volunteers positioned throughout the abbey, and they like to answer questions so don't be afraid of them."

It was a lovely experience if somewhat spoilt by children running around & parents oblivious to their childs behaviour! The guides were brilliant & very informative. The cafe is reasonably priced but some of the staff need to learn to SMILE ! ! A gorgeous day out get there early though to avoid the queues!It was amazing to see our countries past Sovereigns in such fabulous surroundings, will be back again ! !"

From the beloved Poet's Corner to the graves of Queens Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots, standing in an intimacy across the ages which they were unable to realize in their then historic lives, the Abbey stands as an edifice of prayer and practice, aspiration and life of the human race, and as a sentinel of the pillar the British are for us all.

We were able to use the much shorter \"online ticket\" line, and it was discounted, and cheaper. We also chose to be here when the Abbey opened so our wait was only about 5 minutes to get in.The Abbey is magnificent; history, Gothic architecture, tombs, crypts, and memorials abound, leading you on a walk of over a thousand years of British history. The various chapels are lovely. Be sure to take advantage of the audio tour provided by the Abbey. It is very well presented, voiced by Jeremy Iron, and the player is very easy to use. It took us about two hours to make our way completely through, and there are two very nice gift shops and a lovely restaurant on the premises (we had breakfast at the restaurant and it was very reasonably priced and really delicious.)"

The accumulation of English history in this 'church' is just stunning, as is the statuary and other decorations within - you could spend hours just wandering from nook to nook reading and absorbing the information on well-known historical figures.Most disappointing to not be able to take photographs inside (even without flash) but I do understand why - the jostling of the incredible crowds for the best viewpoints would be intolerable!Spent some time talking to a visiting minister from the US and she was most informative about current activities in the Abbey and then I watched as she led prayers shortly after.... a most rewarding few hours.Don't forget to visit the small museum and old chapel with the restored frescos out in the cloisters - also very rewarding and you can take pictures out there!"

As English churches go, it is majestic but in a gothic, rather than the more beautiful Central European baroque, style. Looks aside, it is a must-visit for the pure history contained within its walls. Trouble is, every other tourist in London also wants to see it, and that will be your greatest challenge. Without professing to know all the options, you seem to have a basic choice of either visiting independently (and relying on the audio guide), or going as part of a tour group. Visiting independently, your initial challenge will be getting in the place and swallowing the fairly high entry fee. The line to get in can be long, like a block long.If you go with a tour group, there is a seperate entrance for groups and you avoid the long line. Choose your tour carefully though, as some charge more than others and the quality of guides varies (any guide really has to know his English history to be credible in such a place so full of history ranging over the centuries).We went with London Walking Tours, which at only \u00a38-10 per person, combined with a small discount on the Abbey's entry fee, is an economical tour with guides qualified under London's Tourism Body. Our guide was excellent, so excellent that when we were inside the Abbey and the guide was giving her spiel on something, some people not on the tour would stop their audioguides and listen to her instead. The tour gives you a little less than 2hrs in the abbey, and you can stay longer after the tour ends if you wish. There is a lot to see in the Abbey and it really was funny seeing the independent visitors wandering around the Abbey like zombies listening to their audio device (no doubt getting value out of it but looking funny in the process). The advantage of a person-type guide is that they focus you into the really significant objects/places/people in the Abbey, giving you historical background on some so that you can understand why they are significant. Of course, you are at the mercy of the guide's competence and diligence, so that's why it's important to choose wisely.IN SUMMARY, it's a real lesson in English history, so try to understand what you are seeing either via a person-type guide or the audio guide. Have a strategy to avoid the long line to get in."

It's the same price - \u00a320 per adult and \u00a317 for seniors. We spent about half an hour in the queue which wasn't too long but I wish we'd thought ahead. There are free audio guides, which are a must. We decided to explore under our own steam so we weren't pressured to move on, but we did tag on to some of the tour groups to listen to interesting facts and backgrounds. We spent about 4 hours in the abbey and could have wandered around for longer but it was closing time and a service, which we could have attended, was about to begin. A fabulous visit, well worth it."

Once on my own time table where I had several hours to really see the Abbey and once on a tour in which I was allotted 1.5 hrs to see all that was there. If you are on a tour and just want to say you have been to the Abbey then, see it on a tour. But if you really was to see this beautiful abbey in detail and remember some of the wonderful history, then you must go on your own and spend some real time here. I brought teenage boys this trip and to be honest, it was a been there-done that type of thing that they checked off on their list. But the abbey is worth the time to really immerse yourself to the vast history, glory and gore of this wonderful building."

It is just awe inspiring to think of those that passed through the doors over the centuries. And many royals were married here as well.

When I entered the Abby, a gentleman asked me what country I was from, said good morning to me in Dutch, but unfortunately couldn't give me a headset in Dutch.I took the English one, which was fine, the narration was done by Jeremy Irons, who has a great voice!There are so many important and well known people buried here that it is easy to overlook them. When I started my narration it took me through an aisle, where I did see Mr. Darwin's plaque on the wall. Which I would've missed if I hadn't looked up in time.The beauty of the narration is, that you can stop and start it at will and it has extra you can listen to, by punching in a different number.So when I sat down to take it all in, I could continue whenever I wanted to.It was truly breathtaking, amazing tombs, ceilings and woodwork have been carved in the days of old...actually it is too much to take in! I will have to go back there again!As to the admission fee, it might be a steep one, but absolutely well worth it!"

The tours take you into a couple of spaces not accessible if you are not on the tours; also, it was really helpful to have him tell about the coronation ceremonies, and where everyone sat for royal weddings. He explained where the Queen and other dignitaries would sit during services. One interesting note (which applies to Westminster and other churches in England): Coming from the U.S., it was fascinating to see military memorials inside the churches. Separation of church and state is so significant for us, it just surprised me over and over to see this.One other note that impressed me: In every abbey we visited (and we went to several), including Westminster, they stopped every hour or so to welcome visitors and ask for a silence while they said a brief prayer. It reminded us that we were in a house of worship. Very meaningful and centering.I would highly recommend these tours and a visit to Westminster Abbey."

Use the map to keep track of where you are, and which AV section to listen to.

The outside does no justice to the artistry of the insides.Downside is it is kind of a pricey visit."

Well worth the \u00a320 fee as it goes towards the upkeep and maintenance of this beautiful, historic, timeless building. We found the automated guide to be helpful and interesting, so well worth doing. Also an opportunity to light a candle for your loved ones and write a small prayer for them was special. As others have said the history of this immense place is quite extraordinary and to see all the buriel chambers housing kings and queens from hundreds of years ago was outstanding. The whole experience puts into context that this is not just a place where William and Kate married, they are only the tiniest part of it`s history. Make it a must to see the Lady Chapel, it`s really special.A final word is to say `avoid the tea room at all costs`. It was dreadful, disorganised, rude and unhelpful staff. Serving overpriced, stale cake and luke warm drinks....yuk, in a completely out of sink, modern setting that bore no resemblance to the gothic beauty of Westminster Abbey. Such a shame as they really let the side down. The shop wasn`t anything special either, very touristy and expensive."

We walked through the Abbey and listened to almost all of the audio notes, so we learned quite a bit. Seeing where so many kings and queens of history were wed, inaugurated, and buried, was really interesting, and definitely worth a visit. A final note is that there are no photos allowed inside the Abbey, so leave your camera at home."

I knew that many, many people were buried beneath the floor but somehow was not prepared for all the tombs in the midst of where worshippers congregate. That past and present exist so three-dimensionally in the same space. Yet it is not spooky -- at least not during the day. ;-> The funerary art is wonderful to behold as well as the magnificent architecture. The slides in art history class just didn't do it justice. The soaring vaulted ceilings, the panapoly of English history, the faith and dedication it took to build such an edifice at a time when high tech was pretty much a lever and a pulley are truly awe-inspiring. Okay, having said all that: if you aren't doing London Pass or purchasing your tickets ahead of time, pay with a credit card. A docent from the Abbey came down the extremely long line of people waiting to get in to re-direct any one who had pre-purchased tickets and then asked if anyone was paying with a credit card. We did and had virtually no wait to get in. The tour (both the docents moving you through the line and setting you up with the audio guide and the audio guide itself) is so well organized that you can take it all in and appreciate the surroundings in spite of the crowds. And Jeremy Irons' narration made for easy listening. If it is open during your visit, check out the Abbey garden. It is a quiet oasis in an extremely tourist packed part of London. Also be sure to check out the little museum which explains a fair amount about the burial rites of the rich and royal back in the day. If you stand in the right spot when you exit, you should be able to snap a shot with Westminster (Abbey and some spires of the Palace) as well as Saint Margaret's church and Big Ben. We got all sorts of amazing shots with multiple iconic landmarks in them."

It is a gorgeous building that you will marvel at. The building itself takes your breath away. To think they built it without all the modern equipment we have in today's world is in itself mind blowing! Take your time as you go through Westminster Abbey so you don't miss anything. If you are blessed that day perhaps a choir will be singing in preparation for an upcoming ceremony or service. It is amazing if they are. Truly my favorite attraction in London. So very spiritual. I always light a candle and pray for those I know who are fighting cancer or have needs when visiting any church or cathedral in the UK or Europe or anywhere in the world!

Entrance wasn't cheap - 20 pounds, but I think it's worth it. An audio guide is included in the price. I found it easy to operate, and the commentary interesting.

Time was tight so I asked a bus tour guide which he would recommend out of St Paul's and Westminster Abbey (formerly called St Peter's - from where the saying 'Rob Peter to pay Paul when building St Paul's!). After a long pause he said Westminster but was clearly torn between the 2. Our family was also challenged over this question after visiting both. St Paul's was a wonderful refuge from the Tower of London crowds and rain and offers incredible domes and a whispering wall but Westminster offers amazing history. To view the tombs of kings and queens, poets and writers, explorers and military and naval greats is very humbling. To walk down the nave where Prince William married Catherine was a treat and the arched ceilings are beautiful to behold. Lovers of King Henry VIII will appreciate viewing the tombs of his father, 2 daughters (Elizabeth I lying on top, of course) and courtiers made famous in history fiction and non-fiction books. We visited on a wet day around 11am and although there were no crowds to enter the abbey, the crowds in the church made the visit less private, rushed and crushed. Perhaps try first thing in the morning or listen to the organ play on Sunday afternoon when there is no entry fee. This is a must see for lovers of history, royalty, poets, writers, musicians etc. A tour might be the go, or an audio tour but try to choose a quieter time of day than we did."

This is probably one of 5 most popular visitor attractions in London.To quote many of our British friends \u201cwe were gobsmacked\u2019, an expression used to describe beauty and astonishment.

It would be difficult for even the most gifted poet to put into words the visual treasures of this abbey. Gift Shops \u2013 there was a great variety of items in the gift shop for purchase.

What you'll find inside is one of the best example of architecture that will make you wonder why the hell why don't try to emulate it instead of building stuff in \"modern\" ways? The Lady Chapel in particular is pretty amazing - the ceiling is a masterpiece! Moreover, you'll see and admire some of the most important kings' tombs, last but not least Elizabeth I's one. The symmetry with Mary of Scotland's one give to the place a weird but very fascinating climate. Don't forget to visit the Coronation Chair, and try to think about how many kings and queens in England's history have sat on it - it gives the shivers! The Chapter House is hard to stand thinking of how it was damaged in the Blitz (I'm half German, I really felt ashamed of it) but the glass walls are amazing!Try to see all of it, because it is totally worth it!Also, check out the time for the Evensongs, they'll leave you astounded!"

They do have a gift shop where you can purchase books and postcards, and such. If you enjoy architecture, and history and grandeur - you should definitely visit."

After a week of being nickeled and dimed (an American slang of being charged for EVERYTHING), I just walked outside of Westminster and did not pay to go inside. I did go into the gift shop and paid money for a Will and Kate Wedding book. I labeled average as I really didn't experience the inside and I think it's overpriced. I don't know how the landmarks in London expect people to afford their admission fees. Ok, so you don't have to be free like the Smithsonian in US, but you should figure out how to link admission fees across London attractions."

If you have not booked to \"fast track\" a day ahead, even holding a \"London Pass\" requires a long queue. \"Verger tours\" led by Abbey vergers take you to places other cannot go, costs an extra 5 pounds, which can be purchased after entering the Abbey. This tour is highly recommended and offered several times during tourist days. Check in advance for Verger tour times, and be prompt! Otherwise, you will have only an audio guide option. Allow 2-3 hours for a complete visit to the Abbey.Lastly, for a spiritual experience, take advantage of 9:00am prayers in a small side chapel. Praying is free!"

For a place that is a tourist attraction, it still felt very spiritual and holy to me. I'm actually really glad they stop you from using your camera because if you were busy taking pictures you'd really miss out on the essence of this place. I am also very glad they included the audio-guide with the ticket admission, because some places don't. I found the quality of the audio-guide to be very good. It really educated me on some of the meaning of the monuments within the Abbey. It expanded on the little knowledge I knew before visiting, which is extra value for money really. Because it was all so amazing, it is hard to pick a favourite part or highlight. I loved it all!Here's a tip though, I went in the second week of September and got there a bit early at 8.50 (it opens at 9.30) and there was no one there. It was great for me because I had time to get myself a coffee and have a good look around at the building exterior and admire that. So when the time for other visitors came to line up, and the ticket assistants separated us into separate lines, I was one of the first inside. Oh, and if you buy your ticket online from the Abbey website, you get in before the London Pass holders."

Come to Westminster Abbey to see centuries of history- from the coronations, tombs of Kings and Queens, burials of numerous famous people, spectacular Gothic architecture, etc.. It's definitely a must- see attraction. My only complaints are the ban on photography and the very steep admission fee. It's unnecessary since most of the major Cathedrals across Europe don't impose this. It wasn't a deal breaker for me, and I did sneak a few photos inside. I enjoyed the audio tour- also be aware that it gets very crowded inside."

I began my visit attempting to read all the memorials and give them each their due, but quickly realized how enormous the Abbey is and how many memorials there are and had to abandon my original plan and be more selective about which I spent time on. The self guided audio tour had some good information, but I somehow got off track and it was a bit difficult to get back on. Regardless, there was an overwhelming amount of history to try to absorb here. It's all very beautiful, and as an American, the time span covered is so far beyond what we are used to it's amazing. One thing I realized as I was standing in the area where royal weddings have been conducted was that it's a beautiful place, but you are actually surrounded by hundreds if not thousands of dead people, so I'm not sure that's the ideal wedding spot. They are in the walls, in sarcophagi scattered around the entire structure, and underfoot in the floor. Well worth the time and expense to visit though!"

Westminster Abbey is most noteworthy for its history and being the final resting place for English Monarchs. It is also where the relatively rare coronation of English kings and queens take place. There are marvelous chambers in the Abbey where you will find the crypt of Queen Elizabeth I (with her sister Mary tellingly buried underneath her) among others. As might be expected there are magnificent stain glass windows, but I was more impressed with the enormous pipe organ and fantastic seating areas for the various choirs (the boys choir apparently has its own school on the premises). Exhibits include the accouterments used for coronation ceremonies. A visit is much more constrained than for other Abbeys such as the ones at Bath or Yorkminster, since you can't take pictures and there is no tower climb, but other than that it is a London must see if you haven't experienced it before."

There was no wait there and I think regular payments had a short wait. There were so many small chapels and alcoves that I would have loved to explore and enjoy listening to the audio guide. Unfortunately, we had to just get in and out so as to get our 2 year old back to the hotel for a nap. I would love to return to Westminster Abbey, possibly by myself. I believe the regular admission price was \u00a320 or \u00a322, and this is well worth it, especially if you have enough time to really enjoy it.

We'd been looking forward to revisiting the Abbey for the first time in 30+ years .After queing for a short while we reached the entrance. My wife is waiting for a knee operation and the problem had suddenly got worse over the previous couple of days and she said to the guy at the entrance that she did'nt think she could manage to walk around the Abbey. She was'nt offered the use of a wheelchair and she asked if there was somewhere for her to sit whilst I 'did the Abbey'. She was directed to St Margarets church , which is about 100 metres from the Abbey. When i entered the Abbey the first thing I noticed were a row of chairs before the attendants checked my ticket, but by this time my wife had hobbled her way to St Margarets, also wheelchairs were available..Another big moan is the entry charge of 20 quid ( 17 for students and pensioners ) to visit despite the fact that the Church of England is one of the wealthiest landowners in the Uk .At the time of our visit there were no toilets available ( due to building work ) within the Abbey .This is an absolute joke considering how many people visit every day.

The average price for a adult ticket is \u00a320.00 per person and if you want the guided tour, it's an extra \u00a317.00 per person! - to really understand it's history, the tour is really a necessity. Everything is included in the price, including their magnificent gardens, but for me, I had better value at the other attractions we visited. I appreciate that they have no official funding, it's purely visiting tourists that help maintain costs, but as I have already said \u00a337.00 for one person if you include the guided tour was overpriced."

Maybe Webminster Abbey could split the queue. The queue starting at the left for everybody without the online-ticket or London Pass and a queue starting at the right for people with the online-ticket of London Pass.

Visited on a particularly wet afternoon which may have resulted in the large number of visitors escaping the weather.You are asked to pay 20GBP entry but get access to a free audio guide device.To be honest I did not get any sense of spirituality or tranquility at all with all the crowds of mainly overseas tourists.The majority of the abbey is basically stone tombs in side chapels and it is not clear why they so expressly forbid photography. I would have found it useful to have photographed a number of the tombs to examine in peace later.If you are looking for a place for quiet contemplation or even a solace from the city DON'T come here - there are many smaller and more peaceful churches in London.The central location and the fame of the Abbey make this a tourist trap which the church authorities milk by charging the high entrance price.They claim you can enter free for worship, but that is the last thing I would like to do at this church as stated above.I have visited other great English cathedrals such as Salisbury and Liverpool and found them to be more pleasurable visits.The Abbey contains the tombs of the great and good (and bad) from centuries of British history, and this is fascinating as it is the only place of its kind, but it is difficult to appreciate or even enjoy the experience with the huge number of visitors."

If you can go in during church time to see the service and look at it that way (no pictures allowed during that time) that's definitely better as the cost is definitely not worth it. It's no Italian church! So if you can get in for free, worth the time, otherwise skip out. Go into the mini church right beside it as it's free and also pretty."

OK, firstly the admission fee - get real people this building would take a LOT to maintain and there are a lot of staff around to assist you - this has to be paid for.If you are a history buff this is an amazing place - my wife loved it. Parts of it date back 100s of years and it really is the state church of England and reflects the history of England and its monarchs.While there was a moment of prayer on the hour and services being conducted during the day I still find St Pauls to be more inspirational and conducive to both sightseeing and prayerful reflection."

I\u2019m afraid I could not say the same about the Abbey. A small leaflet is issued and free audio guides are available but I prefer to have a written general guide as I find audio detracts from the experience. Unfortunately none were available until you get to the shop at the end of your tour, which defeats the object of the exercise. Because of this we did miss the significance of a couple of things. I did expect it to be quite busy (10 am) but not the vast shuffling groups of students and tourists which we encountered. For me there was no sense of awe that one usually finds in any cathedral and apart from the short prayer announcement at 11 am, no sense either that this was a living church. This is a very marked contrast to St Pauls, where history and the present are mingled. The Abbey is basically a museum, overwhelming you with tombs and memorials to the great and the (sometimes not so) good, not a place of worship. I was unimpressed by the sight of one of the ushers openly touching up her makeup in the Lady Chapel. The price of entry I found to be way over the top (Seniors \u00a317 each)That said, I particularly enjoyed the Lady Chapel ,the tombs of the early monarchs and the Coronation Chair. Overall I am glad that I visited but felt that the lack of written information very disappointing"

The history alone is amazing and every corner you turn, alights your senses and your mind with experiences that you will never forget. The only downside was we could not take photos inside, and with hopes that a DVD would be for sale in the gift shop at the end of our stay, we were even more disappointed to find they had no DVD of the interior of the Abbey or the history for sale. :( It's such an enormous place it would take years to go through it bit by bit to acknowledge everything there. It's indeed a magical, serene and exquisite place that must be seen when you visit London. 20 GBP per person to get in, children are discounted... but worth every penny. I'm still playing pictures in my mind of the Abbey... it's stolen my heart."

Plan to spend at least a couple of hours inside with your audio guide because there is more to see than is possible to digest on just one visit. We were fortunate to get there during a noon service. There are guides everywhere and NO PHOTOS. I am torn because I do like taking photos but it is so refreshing not to have people standing around snapping pictures and ignoring the magnificence of the experience. It forces one to really pay attention to what one is seeing. It is beautiful; it is inspiring."

Unfortunately you could not take photos inside (which isn't allowed anywhere there are oils on canvas paintings) but there are plenty of places to purchase photos if you want. It wasn't particularly crowded on the day we visited so there was plenty of space to move around the smaller areas of the Abbey. Highly recommend a tour."

Westminster Abbey was like stepping into a past that was replete with Royal Weddings Royal Funerals, Coronation and great figures of history rolled into one. The Audio tour is a must. No photographs are permitted inside the Abbey itself which is a bonus given the high number of selfies that are taken at every other historical attraction but once you enter the Cloisters and other sections of the Abbey precincts photography is permitted. The first thing that struck me was how small Westminster Abbey is. It is not a large Church at all! Canterbury, Salisbury, York Minster are much larger but Westminster Abbey is rich in tradition and history'- the tombs of Edward the Confessor and the greats of English Literature as well as those of the Benedictine Monks whose Abbey Church it once was, Kings and Queens of England are all there. For those who are familiar with Latin and Middle English, the Abbey is a treasure trove. The Funeral effigies of several Kings and Queens of England are on display in what would have been one of the Monastery work places. Did you know that Queen Elizabeth1 was less than 5 feet tall and very tiny? The Coronation Chair is in an alcove beside the Great West Door. Combine a trip to the Abbey with a visit to St Margaret's Church which is in the same precinct of Westminster. A visit to Westminster Abbey should be top priority especially if you love history. If you time your visit well, you may be fortunate to hear the Westminster Choir sing Evensong."

Of course, the outside of the Abbey (including views, within the area, of the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, and the London Eye) are simply stunning. But it\u2019s the inside that is amazing; it is absolutely worth the price of admission, and I would also recommend buying the small guide to the Abbey, which goes deeper into the history of each section. The entire Abbey is fantastic\u2014highlights for me were the Coronation Chair, the graves of and memorials to many famous English church musicians, Poet\u2019s Corner (with graves and memorials of many authors of famous English texts), and, of course, the Henry VII chapel, with its stunning ceiling made of hand-carved stone. What a marvel of early human achievement; I\u2019m not sure modern architects could figure it out! After visiting the main Abbey, it\u2019s also worth spending time in the cloisters on the side, which reveal some of the most ancient parts of the building and all of London.At the Abbey I was particularly struck by the sense of history mixed with vibrant, current life. This does not feel like a dusty museum; it feels like a living institution, vital to the nation in which it stands and still devoted to daily worship, education, and spiritual life.Along those lines, if you have the opportunity to attend Evensong, do. I attended on a Tuesday evening on which the service was sung by the lay vicars; they were a superb choir and the repertoire (traditional English church music\u2014Byrd, Tallis, etc.) was perfect for the setting. Particularly gorgeous were the sung responses to the prayers. Evensong takes place in the quire; if you arrive early, you can sit in one of the wooden stalls (if you arrive later, they set up folding chairs next to the quire, which is perfectly suitable).I\u2019d put this on the must-do-list for London. Of lesser consequence is the store, which is quite well done as tourist shops go\u2014great postcards and various souvenirs, along with a wonderful CD collection (from the Abbey\u2019s choirs and organ) and jewelry collection."

The church is the Monarchs church, therefore a Dean not Archbishop presides over the community on behalf of the King or Queen. It's all but a thousand years old, full of historic tombs and gravestones and beautiful wooden carving. If you're lucky enough to hear the choir practicing then you will think your hearing angels sing."

The price of admission includes an audio tour. This is rather a bad idea, because it means that all of these tourists insist on going to see everything on the audio tour and ignoring everything else. If you want to have a look at something that is on the audio tour, it is overcrowded with foreign tourists. If you want to see something not on the tour, maybe one of the more obscure graves--Prime Minister Gladstone, Stephenson (of Stephenson's Rocket), C.S. Lewis--again you can't because the foreign tourists are all walking over it, ignoring it. They have it all roped off so you have to see everything in the order they want you to see it. You can't say \"Okay, this bit is crowded right now, I will come back to it later\" because it is impossible to avoid the direction of traffic the crowds are funneled in. I ended up unhooking a velvet rope when none of the vergers were looking to go back to an \"earlier\" part of the cathedral. I have never been in any other European cathedral where I wasn't free to wander around.They do say a formal prayer every hour, this seems to be an attempt to remind the crowds that this is actually a place of worship. Then there are small short prayer services in more isolated parts of the cathedral. I joined one at the shrine (i.e. tomb) of St. Edward the Confessor that lasted about 15 minutes.I came here both because I love the history, and I love the sacred religious heritage. I really couldn't figure out what the vast majority of the rest of the crowd were doing there."

We are retired police and military, on this occasion all we wanted was to pay our respects to the Unknown Warrior... We had been in London all day and had no desire to see the abbey again... The aggressive and rude 'cannon' on the door would n or let us in to this area which after all is just inside the main entrance... Disappointed that the authorities will not allow genuine people access to this monument without charging us \u00a334 to do so.. The extortionate fee is one thing but rude aggressive staff is totally unacceptable."

Get there early, I would suggest an hour before the gates open. There is a dedicated \"fast entry\" line for London Pass holders unlike other sites. So this is where the Pass really comes in handy. You are afforded no photography inside so keep that in mind. Our self guided audio tour lasted about 2 hours, but you could go quicker or well longer based on your preference. They have a cafe and gift shop inside. When you're done you are literally across the street from Westminster Pier, Parlament, Big Ben and the River Thames.

During our visit, they asked people to stop and either pray or meditate for one minute on a subject the announcer suggested. This was so much better than in other churches where they keep repeating \"silence\" over a speaker. As tourists, we should respect these holy places with our silence, but when our visit is continually interrupted by someone on a speaker reminding us, it is actually disruptive. Westminster's approach reminded us that we were in a holy place, and the purpose of being in the church is to pray. It is a beautiful place, with so much history--don't miss it!"

The architecture is beautiful, and the atmosphere does feel very reverent- a nice break from the busy chaos of London's streets. Swimming through the crowds got frustrating at times, especially as there were a lot of slow-moving tour groups to navigate around. Also note that there is no photography allowed- I would've loved some interior photos to show friends and family back home, but it did force me to put the camera down and appreciate my surroundings more. Other than those two cons, it was an interesting and enlightening visit that I'd recommend to anyone!"

I took so many pictures of that sun coming up over those building that everyone is going to be sick seeing it. We walked on to Westminster to utilize our London Pass. We were fast tracked in, and on our way with the audio guide. I encourage people to get this audio guide because it was extremely informative, and very user friendly. The map they provide also assist with the guided tour nicely. There are no photographs allowed in the Abbey. It is so overwhelming with all the people around you, and looking in every direction (including down) that it can be over stimulating. The architecture if phenomenon and just takes your breath away. Knowing that so many famous people have stood where you are at, that so many royalty \u2013 including monarchs \u2013 have gotten married there that the history alone is just humbling. All the tombs of famous people like \u2013 Lewis Carrol, Chaucer, Queen Mary of Scotts, Queen Elizabeth I, William Bennet, and there\u2019s a poet\u2019s corner commemorating several incredible authors of our time. There is a list of all the famous people buried there on the Abbey\u2019s website."

We got there about twenty minutes early and, much to our surprise, got a seat in the Choir section next to the singers and close to the speakers.

I didn't realize that it only knocked about a pound off the entrance fee, and for the price reduction, the Abbey doesn't give you one of the audio guide gadgets. So I guess it depends on whether you prefer fixed pace with a live tour guide that you can ask questions of or a program that you can listen to at your own pace.But you need either the audio guide or a live guide in order to appreciate what you are seeing.It did seem that at the price they were charging, they could provide better facilities than the unisex bathroom in the trailer outside.Bottom line, it's crowded and over-priced but probably a must-see if you have any interest at all in British history."

This Cathedral was a setting for many of England's coronations, royal weddings and royal burials. The unique feature of this Gothic Cathedral is the number of important English persons buried or memorialised here, including Edward the Confessor, Ann of Cleves, Mary I, Elizabeth I, Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton, Goeffrey Chaucer, Rudyard Kipling.

The second time I came, I came with a purpose....I discovered that several ancestors of mine are interred here. I recommend doing a little reading about those who are buried here before going. I think it helps one understand the historical significance of this place. The second time, I spent no less than 2 hours wandering in and out of all the little chapels. It is nothing short of mind blowing to see all the intricate carved details of the sculptures and the ornate design of England's past monarchs' effigies. The guides are extremely helpful, and were genuinely excited that I brought bits and pieces of my family tree for reference. They all had extensive knowledge of each person, and even made note that I resemble a few effigies. They were wonderful. I have to admit that I walked around a good part of the day looking up with my mouth dropped open in utter amazement. This place is well preserved, and to know you are walking amongst some of the most powerful and notable people in history, and that you are standing in the very place that history was founded upon and the very place that marriages were held that changed the course of history is almost overwhelming. Do a little homework. Ask questions. Reflect on the signifigance. :) and also please note: pictures are not allowed...and if you attempt to take them, you will be swiftly corrected."

We were there in late March, before the heavy tourist season and walked right in. If you are able to go outside of the summer, I would definitely recommend that. Not just for this location, but anywhere in London. We did not encounter lines anywhere we went."

It houses the tombs of some of our greatest and well known kings and queens and others and also commemorations to some of the country's greatest figures from the arts, literature, science and engineering. There is an admission charge of \u00a320, but less for concessionaries, children and families. You can queue for a few minutes to gain admission so choose a quiet time to visit if you can. Opening times vary, but it is generally open from 9.30am to 3.30pm most days. Spend at least 3 hours there to do justice to the visit. If visiting London it should be at the top of your list of attractions! It really is fantastic!"

I found it peaceful (in spite of the crowds - it does get busy!), and the architecture will take your breath away, especially the fan vaulted ceiling in the Lady Chapel. Nowhere else on earth can you literally stand beside kings and Queens - Elizabeth I, Bloody Mary, Mary Queen of Scots, Edward the Confessor and countless more are buried here, along with commemorations of a real \"Who's Who\" of the great & good. It feels like you are literally touching & breathing the history of Britain. I'd recommend booking online, for ease & speed of entry. Also download the app and free audio guide (voiced in the English version by Jeremy Irons - wonderful!) to your phone, and take your own headphones - otherwise noise from other people's audio guides is a real intrusion to your peace & tranquillity. A once-in-a-lifetime experience, truly memorable."

There are many others (hundreds), they are the ones I can remember. The Abbey has been the place of royal coronations since 1066 and seventeen past royals lie entombed here in the Abbey. Of course, more recently Prince William and Kate were married here (as well as Prince Andrew, Princess Anne, Margaret and the Queen less so recently). Twenty pounds is an expensive entrance fee but you are seeing significant history here and the audio is one of the best I\u2019ve come across on my travels.

The audio they provide with the maps are also very informative. I was in awe of everything."

This way you also bypass most lines. Otherwise, admission is 20 pounds.You are provided with an audio tour. It is breathtaking to walk amidst hundreds of years of history. My favourites were the tombs of Queen Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots in the Lady Chapel. Also, Poet's Corner, where Robert Browning, T. S. Eliot, Rudyard Kipling, Oscar Wilde and Dickens are buried, to name but a few.It was also thrilling to walk the aisle when Prince William and Kate walked to their wedding and Diana's funeral was held."

Whilst access to some areas is no longer pemitted the guided tiour via headphones is well worth it and included in the entry fee.So many of our monarchs are buried here and when one adds the memorials in Statesmen's Corner, Scientist's Corner and Poets Corner you get a great insight into a colourful history.The architecture is inspiring and keep looking about you to take it all in."

My favorite parts are Poets' Corner and the tomb of Mary & Elizabeth.The tour of Westminster Abbey is a bit expensive, but I obviously feel like it is worth the price since I've taken it twice. The ticketed entrance is on the side, not the famous front. There are two lines: one is for those with a London Pass, the other is usually going down the sidewalk toward the Parliament buildings. The line moves pretty quickly, though.Included with the tour is an excellent audio guide. It has explanations for much of the history and items in the sanctuary. There are other areas/buildings that you can explore outside the sanctuary, but make sure you exit through the sanctuary in order to see the coronation chair.There is a cafe (and restrooms? I've never used them) on the premises. There is a gift shop that can be accessed from the outside without taking a tour. You will find it to the right of the famous front facade."

We used the London pass and arrived 15 minutes before opening time and the cue was already quite long. The history, architecture, and structure is incredible. The building is not terribly stroller friendly and especially when seeing the side chapels, my spouse and I rotated going in to see everything. Besides that, this is a must see!! "

We went early in the morning and did not have to wait to long in line.My only negative point would be that as you walk through you visit a series of small enclaves which houses several caskets but there is no indication who these people are - the audio tour points out a few which if they had lists or some indication of who is in these rooms would make the tour more interesting.There are a number of attendants standing around that you can ask questions to but they are mostly there for crowd control.

Excellent information guides with long coats/smocks are located at various points around the facility to answer your questions. Beside the main great halls of the Abbey there are side chapels with tombs and another era of British royalty and intrigue. We went in a counterclockwise direction and wound up in the famous English writers wing at the end (a must-see). Again, watch your step or you will tramp on old and new authors that seem to go so well with this facility. Also, the British equivalent of the US Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located in one of the halls, surrounded with flowers. Unlike the US, that honors its Unknown with a military site and guards, the British Unknown is recognized in this religious facility. My wife and I were almost the last folks to leave and I mentioned to one of the info guides about this fact and he asked me to come with him, behind the exit ribbon to the tomb. He pointed out a pillar next to the tomb that had the US Medal of Honor on it that was presented to their Unknown at the same time that our Unknown was recognized with the British equivalent some years ago. What a memorable gesture. We were truly moved by the whole Abbey...not sure youngsters could make it through it all."

I tend to have issues with the whole idea of royalty, so I was not thinking I would appreciate this place that much. But it was on my wife's list of must see things in our short stay in London. So yes, there are lots of kings and queens buried there, and their histories are quite varied and interesting (for some reason I'm digging Mary Queen of Scots) but there is a whole lot more. Upon learning about some of the brilliant minds that are also either buried or memorialized there (Darwin, Newton, etc.), it was a truly awesome experience. The entrance price is reasonable (compared to the Eye, for example), and they provide a self-guided tour playback device that provides great information and at no additional charge. If you like places of worship, it is a must see, and even if you don't you will probably still like it. We went early on a busy Saturday, and got in before the lines got too long. You can easily spend 2 hours inside the Abbey, but if you attempt to read everything you might need days."

However, we did not feel that we waited a long time. Audio guides provide a lot of information and it is a church that you will need interpretation to get the full effect. The church is essentially a building of tombs, unlike many other churches that you will visit, it is chock-a-block. It almost felt more like a museum than a church. My educational background is English language and literature, so of course I loved poet's corner. The coronation chair is a star attraction. You will also see the oldest door in England, dating back to 1050. So much history, so much to take in. Fascinating visit."

The walkways are clearly marked and they will lead you past the various points of interest in the cathedral. Also, be sure to pick up an audio guide as the narration by Jeremy Irons is quite informative. You will see the tombs and markers of Kings, Lords and other people of significance for their time. You will be in the place where Royal weddings and funerals have been held along with the Queen's Coronation. You can even see the Coronation throne.As you would expect, the cathedral is quite large and you really need to allow a couple of hours to see it properly.

Westminster Abbey is not just a historical landmark; it is first and foremost a sanctuary and a tomb for some of the world's most influential figures. The thing that separates Westminster Abbey from other cathedrals in Europe is the respect they pay to those who were lain to rest in the Abbey as well as those currently worshiping during services. While other countries use their historic churches to shove as many unruly tourists through the doors as possible, set up souvenir depots at every corner, and allow selfies with ongoing worshipers, Westminster takes the higher ground. Because cell phones, cameras, and other tourists grub hub is strictly forbidden inside, it allows visitors to take in all the stunning architecture and historical influence the Abbey has to offer and actually feel something (other than a selfie stick across the head). My biggest regret was not knowing enough about all those former figures who rest in the Abbey. I won't make the same mistake again. For those who do want Westminster Abbey souvenirs, there is a gift outside adjacent to the entrance."

This often made it difficult to move around as the space around some of the monuments can be quite restricted and at times this was very frustrating when views were blocked. This didn't detract from the magnificence of Westminster Abbey itself or the feeling of awe generated by walking amongst the resting places of so many great (and not so great) historical figures and monarchs. I recommend availing of the free audio guides when you enter the abbey as they contain a lot of interesting and relevant information. Also, the English guide is narrated by Jeremy Irons who is a wonderful guide! :)I was particularly interested in the tombs of the monarchs and in Westminster Abbey you can see those of Edward the Confessor (partially hidden), Edward I, Henry III, Henry V, Henry VII, Elizabeth I and Mary I (buried together) and Mary Queen of Scots amongst others. In the chamber containing Elizabeth I and Mary I you can also see the urn containing bones believed (but certainly not proven) to be the princes in the Tower (Edward V and Richard, Duke of York). It was placed there by Charles II when the bones were discovered at the Tower of London in 1674 and Charles decided that they must be the lost princes.You can also view the coronation chair as you exit Westminster Abbey and the famous painting of Richard II.Also worth checking out is the museum which contains funeral effigies of a number of kings and queens.After all that walking around, the Cellarium cafe offers some excellent coffee and muffins.Also worth seeing is the church next door to Westminster Abbey where Walter Raleigh is buried.Westminster Abbey is easily accessible by bus and by tube and is well signposted. The cost of entry is \u00a320 but concessions for senior citizens and students (student card necessary) are available reducing the entry fee to \u00a317. If you want to really take your time over viewing the many magnificent monuments and tombs in relative comfort I recommend not visiting during holiday seasons if possible."

Even if it's not your thing (Evensong is a boy's choir), it is a great way to see the church's interior free of charge. The service is around 30 minutes long and is an interesting way to see this amazing piece of historical architecture. I'd recommend it even if you aren't Catholic or religious in general."

A recommendation, is to attend the 5 pm evensong service open to all but limited to 800'people. The service is 45 min. Long, is free, and allows you to get a flavor of the majesty of this place if you do not want to pay the 20\u00a3 admission fee. Start lining up around 4.10 pm around the side of the abbey. If you are too late, you will be seated where you will hear the service and choral singing, but not see the participants of the evensong service.

It is primarily what you have been lead to expect: tombs and monuments to a lot of historic names, most of whom you haven't heard of. However what will likely surprise you (at least it did me) was the majesty and expanse of the environment --- this place has a 'ceiling' that rivals that of St Peters and there are so many crypts, statues and plaques crammed in here that you wonder how there will be room for anyone else. Once you get over the creepy feeling of walking on someone's gravesite, you will just have visual overload on all the things to try to take in. I'd say get the audio tour if for nothing else than to help you focus your attentions --- it seems to cover a sizeable percentage of the more recognizable figures in the facility. At 20 pounds per person (~US$30/pp as of today's exchange rate) it feels a bit pricey, however I'm sure it takes a lot of money to keep this place maintained and just face it: you're in London. You're going to be spending some pounds while you're here and at the end of the day, this is one of those things that you would probably regret leaving this city and not seeing."

My recommendation: on your first stroll through the abbey, DO NOT use any sort of guide. I'm serious. The traffic flow is clear, so just make your way around. Look. Read. Think. Stumble across names you now...Newton, et al. When you're done and already thoroughly amazed by the experience, then go get a tour book or something like that. Repeat the stroll. Enjoy the majesty of the place...and don't forget, right before the exit, peer to the left for a clear view of the Coronation Chair (aka, King Edward's Chair).

The line is usually not too long, and a free audio guide is included in the admission fee. The audio guide is nice because it allows each person to move at their own pace, and it also gives a very informative background on each item you see displayed in Westminster Abbey. It is also quite interesting to see the actual coronation chair and learn about all the different monarchs that have ruled England. If you research further, you can find the times that the chapel is in session, and you can come watch or participate if you wish. Young children may become bored, as there is not much to keep them occupied, but the great thing about a self-paced tour is you can leave whenever you wish."

            "review": "Surprisingly Interesting. This was one of the stops i was told we must do. I didnt know much about the Abbey other than it's use for the Royal Family. I wasnt looking forward to touring yet another church. However i'm glad i didnt make an issue about going because it was an amazing, eyeopening experience.First i was unaware of all the people who are buried within the church. It was odd since i have never been in a church where people have been buried within the church. Besides awe, it gave the place more of an aura of respect. You are not just walking through a church (where respect levels may vary based on your personal religious beliefs) but you were also walking around a graveyard, something that i feel makes most more somber and respectful. The included audio guide was great, as was they way the church is somewhat sectioned off to guide you through it, yet you can go through at your own pace. While there they had a mass which you were able to attend. I personally had a great experience with one of the volunteers. While seeing the tomb of the unknown soldier I noticed a plaque on a column with a ribbon. It was a US Metal of Honor, presented from the US to the UK tomb of the unknown soldier. While explaining what it was and how slim the chances are we would ever be so close, literately within inches, of a real metal of honor in our lifetime to my friend. An elderly gentleman came up behind us and said \" you two must be Americans\". He then shared with us some stories about his experience as a kid during ww2 and his posting in southeast Asia a couple years after the war ended. It was a great experience and one that i will always remember.Speaking of the war, there are still signs of the damage from the wars that personally really hammered home just how old this place was and how much history/change it has seen through the years. For history buffs i would recommend planning a day just to tour this place. I was there for only about 3-4 hours and still had to rush through and skip some because of time. Non history buffs i would say 2-3 hours to really see everything."

I am not a religious person, so this was not the draw for me. I was there primarily for the beauty of architecture and historical value that the Abbey presents. The thing that surprised me most is that although photographs are prohibited, just about everything is hands-on. I took a few moments and spoke with one of the very friendly and knowledgable staff about the reasoning for this as we visited Sistine Chapel and the Vatican and it was quite the opposite. I was told that as the Abbey is the property of the Queen, she holds the copyright to all of the contents and has not given permission for pictures. Additionally, with the advent of \"selfie sticks\" and \"go-pro\" cameras they didn't want to have anyone climbing on the tombs. The reason for the hands-on is that the Abbey is a working church and holds services every day so the decision is to allow parishioners and those interested to touch if the spirit guided them. Made sense to me."

This time, we bought tickets online before our arrival, printed them out and got there before opening time and waited along with lots of other people however we were at an advantage.... Many of those waiting in line had the London Pass or needed to purchase tickets so we actually ended up being the very first to enter the Abbey that day! Awesome!!!! Be sure to ask the Folks in green robes at the entrance which line you're supposed to be in...it isn't clearly marked in any way...I think that also helped us with the getting in first part. :-)We also had our 9 year old son with us and it was SO special. There is a little scavenger hunt along with the audio guide for the children and it really kept his attention...and is free! At the end they get chocolate for completing the hunt! What made the visit so special was the wonderful man working for the Abbey who took the time to speak with my son and he actually got the chance to go into the roped off area where the choir boys sing! The man spent probably 20 minutes with us answering questions and we left feeling so grateful for the experience.Make the effort to go here but plan in advance!"

I considered Westminster Abbey a must-see even before ever being to London simply because in my mind it kept a testimony of british history so important to the whole of Europe and of the world.I wasn't wrong, I am by no means an expert on British history but seing all those graves really gives one a perspective on how important and present monarchy has been in British history. More so that in any other country.To understand better England this Abbey is a good step forward, and it is a powerful and beautiful reminder of how many important men Britain has produced and how many important tasks they accomplished.A humbling experience for a 30 year old as myself who has often read of these men in histroy books, marveling at their victories without realising that many of them had my age when they accomplished such things.Aside from all this it is a pleasure to see this architecture and the hundreds of details, statues, engravings inside the Abbey, and although the Abbey in itself is not very big (at least comparing it to the basilicas w have in Rome) it is really a wonderfulsight inside and out. Again an A+ for the organisation.All this said I must be honest, I do believe that \u00a330 is a bit much specially compared with the fact that museums are free. It was quite an expensive visti for the both of us, it was my first time in London and I had to see it, but let's say that if I do get back next year I am not sure I would spend that kind of money again."

The magic for me of taking a photo is in bringing home a photo that captures something of significance to me. The place was incredibly crowded . While most staff were kind and friendly the security guard on the front was rude and gave me the wrong advice twice (I asked him where people with online tickets were to line up and he pointed me to a long line up for people who didn't have tickets were to go. When I double checked he sent me back there again. We were later pulled from the long queue by other staff and allowed to enter because we already had online tickets. We encountered the same guard and he was rude again (July 20 at about 10:00). Having said all of the above, the Abbey is one of a kind and it should not be missed.

Make sure you get the audio guide to listen to the various recordings as you make your way around the Abbey. They do offer guided tours that seemed pretty good, but we preferred to do it ourselves by walking around at our own pace. While Notre Dame in Paris is impressive, this was actually even more interesting. If you want to experience the rich history of England in a gigantic and beautiful space such as this, make sure you visit Westminster Abbey. It's right by Big Ben, Parliament and the Winston Churchill museum. You can also head on over to the Thames River and jump on the tour boat and take a ride up to The Tower of London and Tower Bridge. By the way, this is included in the London Pass. If you're looking to do all of the key tourist sites in London, it's crazy not to get the London Pass. They do charge a hefty admission here if you don't have the pass. You'll save plenty of money."

Over a thousand years of monarchs have been crowned and married in this building, not to mention some MAJOR notables who lay buried on the property (I got a kick out of Darwin's gravestone myself). For that reason alone, it's a must see for visitors."

Seemingly, anyone who's ever been somebody in English history/culture is either interred here or is at least memorialized in one form or another. It's not too expensive to get in and the free ear phones are a must to guide you and to explain some of the highlights. Don't rush, there are wonders, views and history all around you. We arrived @ 3 PM, suffered through a short line at entry, and departed near closing (@ 5 PM?) fully impressed by it all!"

You can get a free audio guide which I recommend getting so you know what you're looking at.It was \u00a320 to get in, which is a bit steep but if you have room in your budget for it, it's worth going in.Toilets are in the Abbey but from what I could see and heard it was unisex and not really clean, so make of that what you will.There was long lines to get in but as long as it was, we got in within 15-20min. There was a guide patrolling the lines to move people through if you had a London Pass, so maybe look into those if you have no patience for lining up. We went in early July 2015 so peak season with lots of tourists.Overall though highly recommend visiting."

There are very few signs explaining everything, and without the guide we didn't know what we were looking at most of the time.

We planned to tour inside Westminster Abbey but arrived at 4:15pm and found that tours not only cost a bit more than we wanted to spend, but they closed at 3:30pm to prepare for \"Evening Song.\" What's \"Evening Song?\", I asked. Evening mass. Which happens at 5pm every evening. And as a religious service, it is free. This is a highlight, folks. Trust me.So we waited in line for about 15 minutes. The advised that no photography was allowed, as it is a full, hour long religious service. They checked our bags and seated us inside.The service was glorious. Words cannot describe the ethereal sound of the choir (all males) as they processed into the cathedral. It brought tears to my eyes.The service itself was fairly brief, about 1 hour, and included a mix of songs sung by the magnificent choir, prayers and readings. On the day we attended, one of the readings was done by a foreign diplomat, which was kind of interesting, also.They did usher us out (gently & slowly) at the end of mass, leaving ample time to meander about just a bit and snap a few inconspicuous photos. Docents chastise you if they hear the click of a camera, so use your cell discreetly if you are inclined to photograph the cathedral before or after Evening Song.And again \"Evening Song\" is religous services at 5pm daily, and it is free entry."

And then too, where we were standing, on the graves of some of the so-called martyrs.

It is the chapel of the Order of the Bath and the flags of the Knights are flying above their stalls. Also, the tomb for Henry VII and his queen, Elizabeth of York, designed by Torregiano is referred to as ushering the Renaissance into Britain. A pivotal work of sculpture and art.The Abbey houses many other important realia of English history; the Coronation Throne, the Shrine of St Edward the Confessor, and tombs of important figures such as Winston Churchill, Mary, Queen of Scots, the Unknown Warrior, Geoffrey Chaucer and the like."

This incredible abbey is breathtaking to experience, allowing all to pay homage to giants of history buried there, enjoy art & architecture or to reflect and pray as countless people have done for the past millennium. An architectural wonder this ancient place of worship in the heart of Westminster caters to every traveller, tourist or pilgrim. Once the meeting place of the English government, it is filled with beautiful architecture, stunning stained glass windows, monolithic sculpted tombs and memorials to some of the most important people in history. From Elizabeth the First of England to Charles Dickens, Sir Issac Newton to Charles Darwin etc.The place where the British monarchs have been crowned, buried and celebrated is a must see for anyone coming to London.I advise looking at website before you visit - often closed to tourists for religious services and memorials; the opening hours are varied and few compared to other popular London attractions.Go early as there are often massive queues of tourists waiting to enter and it really is much more special when it is quiet and there are fewer people. If you are entering as a tourist you must pay and admission charge - I think it was around \u00a315 for an adult which I think is very expensive. There is an audio guide included in price and it is very detailed explaining many facets of history, art, contents and religion. (The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and happy to talk & help) The audio guide takes you on a tour of the abbey its chapels and cloisters. If you are there to worship entry is free but Id avoid busy times as being so popular it can be very full with tourists and school groups from around the world. Despite the very expensive entrance fee, it is so worth the cost! Whatever interested you have from history, art, the monarchy etc the grandeur and majesty of this jewels in Londons crown is so worth a visit. (On a side note - to help spread the cost as a tourist in London - i recommend entering the abbey with the London Pass - available for tourists from one to several days - this card provieds access to abbey as well as many other incredible London landmarks - which when visiting a few or many can become quite expensive after the travel costs admission fees are added up.)"

The small choir is excellent - young boys through adults - and just like you may have seen on TV.

Everything else was a freaking bonus and a half!Westminster was absolutely stunning both inside and out. There was so much history to take in. When you arrive, you pay inside or present your London Pass (I had a London Pass) and get started on your tour. If you have the London Pass, you get a free audio guide (looks like an old school cell phone that you hang around your neck and put up to your ear). The abbey is setup with a clear path around the whole building so you get the full experience. Things to note: make sure you look for the numbers indicating when you should move on through your audio guide. There's an area where you can light a candle and leave a prayer that they will say out loud at the designated times. Bring your own pen! There are times throughout the day where they ask everyone to join them in prayer and it's beautiful to see a whole slew of people, stop, bow their heads in silence. There are other times throughout the day where they do special ceremonies but it is a working abbey so you will see clergy cleaning, setting up, etc., which is also cool. Of course, the historical significance is amazing. So much to learn, to see, to do.Things to note:1) Make sure to pay attention to the numbers and your audio guide, it can be a bit confusing.2) When they say an area is tight, they mean it. Be careful if you're claustrophobic.3) If you have issues with stairs, be careful, a lot of the stairs are uneven. It's old!4) Do not take pictures. There are signs everywhere asking people not to do so for a reason - it ruins the artwork.5) After Poet's corner, there is an area with a lot of seating for services, etc., in case you need a break.6) Plan for plenty of time, trust me! You'll want it!"

It is always worth a look around Westminster Abbey - there is so much to see that you always learn something - but this time I found it to be more like a tourist attraction than a church.First of all had to queue to pay (and was unable to gift aid the fee like many other Cathedrals), and felt that the adult entrance fee of \u00a320 was a bit steep, even for London. The roped areas led everybody on the same path around the Abbey, and it was disappointing that photography was prohibited - even without flash. Most visitors were listening to the audio guides, thus inadvertently blocking the way to others.To be honest, I found the hordes to be a bit overwhelming, and passed through quite quickly. The one place I wanted to see was the Chapter House, but it is not open to visitors.Have given a rating of four for the history, but really was a bit disappointed this time."

In all my trips to London over the years I have avoided Westminster Abbey as it's always been so busy This year I was in London in mid January and there were no queues. I can't believe what I have missed all these years. It is the most amazing place. If you have any interest at all in English history this is an absolute must. To see the multitude of monuments, tombs and memorials to the greatest of British people is just overwhelming. I could have spent the entire day there, 5 hours was just not enough time. The audio guide is very good although it doesn't cover everything (how could it?). The various officials standing around are very helpful and knowledgeable if you have any questions. There is a wonderful little book in the bookshop called 'Who's Buried Where?' that would have been very helpful had I bought it when I went in rather than when I left. I would have liked to have found some of the more obscure tombs.Of course the atmosphere, the windows, the building itself are all extraordinary. It is still a working abbey so services are conducted there.It's a must - allow at least a morning or afternoon. You won't be disappointed."

As you walk through the building all your are reminded of the many historical events, housed within these walls.

If you are able, I would highly recommend taking the tour. As with most sites, it really makes the significance of the building come alive. Just as impressive as the interior, the exterior is a site in itself. The architecture of Westminster Abbey leaves one speechless because of its soaring towers and intricate beauty.

It is no wonder that the main churches of London have so many visitors and even anti-imperialists may find the collective story of Britain to be much more than East India Company and its peers plundering one nation after another. Westminster Abbey shows us those who have brought so much to mankind as well, from science to poetry, exploration of Africa to the exploration of the universe.But there's the rub. So much to see and so many people to see it, Westminster Abbey has become an efficient conveyor belt and one walks in, gets passed a guide device and off you go in a surge of others. That's great for income but I would give two pieces of advice. 1) Find out when it is quieter to go there.2) Buy online and print your tickets. You can save ages waiting.It should be 5 Stars, the notch down is because I and other tourists are legion...that's a population issue and nothing to do with the abbey itself."

More secular than sacred, Westminster Abbey is directly under the Crown rather than the Bishop of Canterbury.\nThere is much worth seeing here, but best to wait for a docent led tour by one of the clergy, which happen perhaps twice a day. Nice little gift shop, and just a short stroll to Parliament."

The Abbey is fairly expensive for the entrance fee, but it is so important that it is worth consideration. The Abbey is remarkable in that it is a functioning place of worship as well as a historical site. It is like a short history of England in one location. It dates back to Edward the Confessor and stretches up to historical events of today like the wedding of Prince William and Kate. Considering the amount of visitors and the many roles the building plays they handle the visitors very well. It is also a place of physical beauty. It is more than historical, it is a work of art. If one is a Christian it has even another level of significance as an important site of Christian history. It is also a functioning graveyard in a sense. Many of the monarchs of England are buried there as well as poets, musicians, and historical figures like David Livingstone. I would highly recommend a visit to the Abbey."

Adults are 20 pounds ($31.42 USD) and children between 6 and 16 are 9 pounds ($14.14). With so many things to see and do, we opted out of the tour inside. However, even if you aren't going to tour inside, there is plenty to take in and photograph. There is a little chapel on the grounds that you can enter free. While there is lots of history around Westminster Abbey, we opted to visit St Paul's Cathedral and go inside for free."

My teenage daughter loved it too. We even went back for the Evensong service which was beautiful and uplifting. It was a honor being in the church. One funny thing did happen to us...one of the people working there said, \"You must be from America.\" We said we were and asked how he knew...he said, \"You were smiling!\" I guess Americans smile more!

I bought my ticket online and skipped the queue out front, not that it was long on a wednesday morning. I expected a quick walk through and ended up spending over 2.5 hours in the Abbey, I even participated in communion which was a very neat experience. Communion too place at 12:30 and is free to the general public as well as those on the audio tour. The only caution I would have is if you are traveling with kids.

You cannot walk around to see much, only what you walk past on your way to the choir stalls. However I would not trade in this experience for a tour of westminster. A unique and breath-taking experience which gave the surrounds so much more atmosphere and vice-versa.

The stories about the Abbey were so interesting that even our 9 year old was entertained until the very end of a 2.5 hour tour.There is so much to see and you are part of it all- nothing like your typical museum!The inside is stunning. If you had to pick one 'cultural visit' in London, Westminster Abbey, should be it!"

Its also a bit much to forbid your paying customers to take photographs- apparently on the grounds that the abbey is \"sacred\"- doesn't stop them taking lots of your money on entry though and routing the exits through their shop and tearoom! I've given four stars on the basis that it's Westminster Abbey but as a visitor attraction it leaves much to be desired."

Also, I highly recommend paying the extra 5 pounds for the verger tour. I learned so much more than from the audio tour and it was much more engaging. Also, on the verger tour, you are allowed to go into the shrine to see the tomb of Edward the Confessor and several other British monarchs. We spent almost 5 hours here. There is literally history at every step! The cafe was also nice - enjoyed a nice lunch and then went back to exploring the abbey. This was quite possibly my favorite place in London. The only negative is that you are not allowed to take photos inside the abbey (which I totally understand). Fortunately, they have several nice books for purchase which capture the beauty of the abbey."

It is very busy inside and some of the chapels that you will go in are very small it's just something you have to put up with.If you walk around the cloisters this is counted as being 'outside' so you can take photo's and you will come across a tea room also serving light lunches and they have toilets here."

Westminster Abbey is chock full of history in every nook and cranny.You can see the burial spots of some of the most famous monarchs, authors, poets, scientists, etc in English history, not to mention the coronation throne that dates back centuries. There is also the gorgeous Gothic architecture. The only real problem is that when it's crowded it can be very difficult to see many of the special things. There's nothing that can be done about that, short of turning the whole church into a giant queue, but it is a legitimate issue when you're trying to see a certain tomb or appreciation some of the beauty around you. With crowds pushing from every direction it can be difficult to enjoy, especially if you're of the shorter variety. Also, I hated that no photography was allowed inside the church.

It's like a symbol of strength for the Nation (it survived the London bombings of WWII immaculately) and also of continuation, as many monarchs rest here spanning a period of 1000yrs. There are over three thousand people buried in the Abbey: notable among these is the Unknown Warrior, whose grave (close to the west door) has become a place of pilgrimage and Heads of State, who visit the country, invariably come to lay a wreath at this grave.The Abbey has been the setting for every Coronation since 1066 and for numerous other royal occasions, including sixteen royal weddings (the last one being the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's in April 2011). Today it is still a church dedicated to regular worship and to the celebration of great national events. It also houses the Westminster Abbey Choir and the choir's school. with an extensive repertoire that ranges from early sixteenth century polyphony to the very most recent commissions. The Abbey contains the most important collection of monumental sculpture anywhere in the country with 600 monuments and wall mounted tablets: the famous Coronation Chair that was made for King Edward I in 1300 circa and that enclosed the famous Stone of Scone (brought over fm Scotland) is just one of those. You'll most likely hv to queue around St.Margaret's Church in order to get in on most days, but it's generally fast moving. Tours take 1.5hrs, but if you really want to take it all in and give yrself time and dedicate attention to the antique artworks and tombs I think 2-3hrs is more realistic.Audio-guides are included in the price of yr entry and are very informative, besides being recorded with the incredibly manly and yet soothing voice of British actor Jeremy Irons: you won't want to hand it back!!"

The building is breathtaking and it is worth taking a seat when you can and looking up and around, so many people were rushing around but it is so worth sitting and taking it all in.The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and all in all it was a fantastic experience and well worth the money!"

We went for 930am opening time & still it was so overcrowded. The audio tour was ok. Still lots of information missing. We got in quickly arriving at 920am. But the abbey which is beautiful soon became so overcrowded you squeezed through the chapels. Significantly more stewarding is required to ensure single file through the chapels.I didnt take in as much of the abbey sights as I would if it was a crowd light tour. I would like to return well outside of tourist main season."

Get the London Pass if Westminster Abbey as well as other popular sites are on your list of things to do. The Abbey houses tombs and monument stones to just about anyone who was anyone in England during the past 400-500 years. Royalty, authors, poets, statesmen, etc. are all commemorated in this beautifully ornate building. You can tour at your own pace and there is much to see. You could probably spent 60-90 minutes in the Abbey. The adjacent grounds (the Cloisters) are also beautiful to visit. To stand in front monuments for such authors as Charles Dickens, T.S.

First, buy your tickets online so you can by pass the long line to purchase tickets. Second, take the Verger tour if you can arrange it. I do not know if this can be arranged in advance, but it was clearly worth the additional 5 pounds. I would recommend spending additional time with the audio equipment either before or after the Verger tour to see everything at your own pace.

My friend noticed a trend in England: you could have the most amazing attraction or monument, visited by millions of tourists, and then in some corner you'd have a pile of trash, or a really badly-colored wall, or exposed electric wires, or something that makes the site's maintenance look very unprofessional.The Westminster Abbey is an extreme example, which has all of these elements. Large parts of the abbey's walls which are supposed to be bare stone, are painted with many layers of cheap paint, including some ceilings. The stones at your level are often filthy and blackened by human touch. There are exposed electric wires going right on top of some memorial plaques. And this is one of the most-visited tourist sites in the world. It really takes away from the experience.Other than that, the abbey is not bad. It's interesting as a church, and of course for the main interest\u2014being the burial place of many key people in history, such as Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Winston Churchill. On the other hand, the place is so crowded that you can't properly stop at many tombstones, and you're likely to miss many important ones if you don't look for them specifically/ask the staff.It's probably worth a visit once if you're in London (prepare for long lines), but don't hold your breath. You certainly won't see the amazing theoretical splendor of the abbey as portrayed in movies like The Da Vinci Code."

With this in mind, I would advise the following when planning your visit: 1) Try and get on a tour very early in the morning, as early as possible, as the crowds through most of the year (March to October) are very busy. If you can visit in the winter months, so much the better. 2) When on tour, of all that is to see in the Abbey, there are obvious highlights such as Poet's Corner and the Royal Tombs. However, for me the highlight is entering the King Henry VII Chapel, with its stalls and banners for the Knights of the Bath. If this doesn't take your breath away, nothing else will. 3) Please do attend a service at the Abbey, ideally the Evensong service usually at 3.0pm. Entrance to the services is free. Just say you are attending the service at the door and you will be shown a seat in the Quire. Here you will hear the world famous Abbey Choir, and listen to the equally famous 110 stops Harrison & Harrison Organ. It is only when the crowds are gone and you are listening to the service, that the magic of this ancient Royal Abbey church truly reveals itself, and is highly recommended."

Many famous names are part of the rich history of Westminster Abbey, from royals to scientists, poets and aristocrats. If you are a romantic, you will want to see this church where Katherine Middleton and Prince William were married in 2011.This church is also one of the background locations in Phillipa Gregory's book, \"The White Queen\". So if you read the book or followed the TV series, you will enjoy this place.Tip: If you need a break, the cafe near the gift shop serves really good tea and scones for a reasonable price."

Westminster Abbey is an iconic medieval structure and the site of many historic royal and national events, from coronations and weddings to burials and even deaths. Centrally located in London, Westminster Abbey was first constructed in the eleventh century by King Edward the Confessor, a Saxon king who dedicated this new church to St Peter. Wonderful thing to see. Did not like the line to wait for 1 hour to enter the place."

Surely the monuments, burials, and the cosmati pavement are worth a visit, but the experience compared to other cathedrals/abbeys leaves something to be desired. One person in our party probably summed up the experience quite well: the other places we visited were loved by a dedicated staff of volunteers, at Westminster Abbey people are just doing a job.Though it is worth a look, I realize in the other cathedrals/abbeys the \"feeling\" of the place is much more to my liking and adds to my enjoyment."

The most recent time, in early June 2015, we arrived before opening to stand in line, and it was well worth it. The crowd was very minimal, and at times we were completely alone in parts of the abbey. It was almost magical, and added greatly to the experience. I did not bother with an audio guide because I already know much about the abbey. To be in the presence of kings and queens and statesmen and nobles and poets and writers - it is incomparable for any person of English descent. To pay homage to Elizabeth I, Henry VII, and so on ... you need to visit Westminster Abbey at least once in your life. The more, the better, in my opinion.And do not miss out on the Abbey museum! It opens at 10:30am, while the Abbey opens at 9:30am, but the museum is wonderful. It's a small collection of various things like royal wax effigies and extant costumes for them, and a very old altar piece, and more. It is one of my favorite parts."

The TV show \"Monarchy\" with David Starkey is a good start (we watched on Netflix). At Westminster Abbey, we took the paid, guided tour and the audioguide tour. The paid tour is well worth five pounds, if for no other reason than gaining access to the normally-blocked-off tombs of Edward the Confessor, Henry III, Edward I, Edward III, and Richard II - truly some of the most noteworthy British kings of all time. After the 1.5 hour guided tour, we got free audioguides and took that tour as well. Each tour covered many subjects that the other did not; there was only mild overlap.If you appreciate history, dig royal weddings, or are Anglican/Church of England, Westminster Abbey is ground zero.

It's everything you hope it will be. It's a MUST on a London sightseeing trip."

The building itself is a fine example of ancient architecture. All the Kings and Queens of England have had their coronations there.But most interesting are the buriel sites,monarchs, prime ministers, poets and playwrights are all buried here. Because there is so much to see it is best to get a map of the Abbey before going in. Photography is not allowed. It is best to go early in the day because otherwise the queue can be quite long."

They spoke to us as though we were a group of primary school students, not young adults. If not for this, the experience would have been perfect."

The afternoon sun made for better pictures than last time, but there was a line and the attending employees were telling us and everyone behind us that waiting was futile, we wont get in. Never shaken, we went for it and made it through. The Abbey is a stone wonder and really built around \"The Confessor's\" tomb. Yes, many Royals are buried here and this building is spectacular and history bound, but at its heart it still a functioning ode to England, it's people and God. See Poets Corner and all the famous resting places(The Confessors tomb) is off limits due to a fragile floor. The Coronation Chair is now behind glass and everything is as I remembered it, old and venerable. We did feel a bit rushed as it was towards closing and they were sealing off sections as people filed through. Still we love this church and always admire the past here. There is no entry discount vouchers, though London Passers and students are obliged. There is no photos here sadly ( we have many from when you could, and much video, but that was then). Westminster Abbey should be seen by all at least once in your lives."

We started with a light lunch in the excellent Abbey Cellarium Cafe - quite hard to find off Dean's Yard but well worth seeking out - and then to join a short queue for the Abbey itself.A|lthough we qualified for a concessionary entrance fee, it still cost \u00a334 for the two of us. Although we know it is the the only source of income for a building with what must be tremendous upkeep costs, it still seemed a lot to pay to enter a house of worship for only an hour or two. But there is plenty to see. The internal architecture is much more interesting and spectacular than the exterior and the place is absolutely full of tombs and plaques.It's quite impossible to take it all in on one visit so a return, despite the cost, is very much on the cards. As might be expected the Abbey was full of tourists and once or twice we got caught up with largish groups with a guide which made progress quite difficult as in places, they tend to create a blockage. We didn't take up the offer of the audio guide which was probably a mistake. Photography is not allowed which seems a shame as no such restriction applies in many similar buildings, especially abroad, although I accept that it can be intrusive for other visitors. There is a set route round so that you are sure of seeing everything but, other than trying to return against the flow which would be quite difficult, there is no means of retracing your steps to have another look."

The building is still magnificent. I don't even mind the hip-to-haunch crowding of fellow tourists. But the Rococco clutter wears you out. The longer the epitaph and the more numerous the weeping-angel statues, the less significant the honoree. Too many monuments are more about imperialism and hereditary privilege than virtue or service. But go anyway. You can't not go. Put my grumbling out of your head, study the Abbey's web site and install its app, brush up your English history, pick a date that's not a bank holiday, and go."

See the burial tombs of King Henry III, Mary Queen of Scot, Queen Victoria and many King Edwards."

One of the places that we neglected to do much research on was Westminster Abbey, only because we knew we wanted to see it regardless. When we both walked into this place, we were floored. The tombs, altars, stained glass, individual shrines, and statues are unbelievable. We actually enjoyed this more than the British Museum in this regard. To be in such a momentous place seeing the tombs,markers of Isaac Newton, Florence Nightingale, Chopin, the Bronte sisters, Jane Austen, kings and queens, and others was mind-blowing. Such a unique treasure. Don't miss out on this place. The phone audio guides provided in various languages are neat and guide you through the abbey from location to location using numbers. We were also lucky enough to hear the organ and choir practicing while we were there. It gave me chills."

However, it did not deter me from visiting this beautiful place. I first saw Westminster Abbey was on television when Princess Diana had her funeral in year 1997, and later Prince William's wedding in year 2011. This place looks like a place for the royal family for coronation, wedding, and funeral.Inside of this building is very grand and has a classic Gothic design. I was really amazed and impressive with its grandeur architectural design. One thing to note, there is Martin Luther King's sculpture just on top of the West Entrance door arch.

Westminster Abbey was built between 1245 and 1517 in French Gothic and perpendicular Gothic styles. Its cloister preserves some Romanesque features of an 11th century abbey built on the site by Edward I \u201cthe Confessor.\u201dI am not a big fan of paying an admission charge to visit a church and consider a \u00a3 20 entrance fee for the Abbey out of all proportions. However, the cloister is free to visit. You can enter the cloister from the Dean\u2019s Yard that is situated behind the adjoining building.When entering the cloister, you will receive a yellow laminated card you must show. At the back of this is a map of the cloister, just in case you lose your way walking around the cloister. The rib-vaulted Gothic cloister was reconstructed after a fire destroyed the original one in 1285.From the cloister there is a view of the south fa\u00e7ade of the Abbey with its flying buttresses and Gothic windows. The cloister also gives access to the Chapter House where Henry III\u2019s Great Council and the Commons met until 1395. The Chapter House is accessed through a beautiful archway in which you can find what is considered Britain\u2019s oldest door from the 1050s. The octagonal structure was constructed in 1245 and preserves its original tiled floor and very beautiful murals.The cloister also provides access to the Pyx Chamber, the Abbey\u2019s treasury chamber. The Romanesque chamber dates from the late 11th Century. The name derives from the wooden chest holding coins that were used to judge newly minted coins and that was kept in the chamber. From the cloister, you can also access the Abbey\u2019s museum. Among its exhibits are replicas of the crown jewels used during the rehearsals of the coronation.When I visited on a Saturday morning, it was not very crowded. After visiting it, I saw the long queue of people waiting to enter the Abbey itself. So, if you do not like to stand in line to see a church or the tombs of famous people or if you are not too keen on parting with a considerable amount of money to do so but want to see some of the Westminster Abbey, this may be a nice alternative.In no way am I suggesting you should not visit the Westminster Abbey. If this is that one time you are here and you can afford it, don't deny yourself the opporunity to visit this famous and beautiful Abbey. Even then, don't forget to visit the cloister. I recommend a visiting time of less than an hour. This is more than enough time to visit the cloister and the elements mentioned here. A visit of the Abbey itself may require considerable more time."

Arriving at the opening we had to wait only around 20 minutes at the queue which I think was absolutely ok for such a popular attraction.Near the entry you can book a verger tour for additional 5 pounds. I highly recommend it! Verger tour was one of the reasons our visit was so successful. It is 90 minutes tour full of history, humor and fascinating information. Audio guide is good (I used it after the tour to visit areas not included in the tour) but verger tour is amazing!We also entered some areas normally closed for visitors.I suggest to plan at least 3-4 hours at the abbey.After verger tour we wondered around with audio guide and after 4 hours the decision to leave in order to see other places at Westminster didn't come easy.I also suggest to read about relevant historical figures (monarchs, writers) prior to the visit.You will find the visit more interesting.You will note many curious facts: Queen Elizabeth I is buried across Mary Queen of Scots and shares the grave with here half sister Queen Mary I, Princes from the Tower are buried here as well as their sister Elizabeth of York and people who might be suspected in their death (Henry VII, his mother Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville the wife of Richard III)..."

Words can't describe the experience of walking through the cathedral that has been the backdrop to so many iconic weddings and funerals. So many amazing figures in history are housed in their final resting places here. The audioguide points out all the major things you want to see. I also used the Rick Steves guide as well. Well worth the price of admission. We went first thing in the morning and it wasn't too crowded."

We got in just before 3:30 pm and stayed so we could get in line for the 5:00 pm service. Don't leave the abbey - if you want to stay! They will let you get in line. Folks start lining up around 4:30 pm for the 5:00 service. We were able to sit in the pews which are right next to the choir. There is limited seating and they direct you were to sit.

They start at the North Door, last for approximately 90 minutes and include a tour of the Shrine (containing the tomb of Saint Edward the Confessor), the Royal Tombs, Poets' Corner, the Cloisters and the Nave. I took one with some visitors last summer and it is the only way to do it. I think it cost \u00a35 more on top of price of entry and you have to call ahead and book it but it's well worth it.

A communion service is also offered twice a day, always nice to partake of this in the abbey, you do not have to take communion you can have a blessing or just stay in your seat if you wish. Another good thing to do is put a card in the box near the candles to be read out during the service for a prayer for someone. To really get the full experience you can also attend Evensong, just check the days in advance when this is on. You can do all or none of these but l found them all to be well worth the experience depending on how much time u have, if you just do the Audio guide allow around the 2 hours .

Of course, the secret is to order your ticket in advance and be there at the opening before the tour buses arrive. I was able spend some time alone with Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots and study their resting places and remember their tangled lives without being herded and pushed through by the crowd.

I totally agree with the reviewers Rab365 (May 17 2015) and Darwinbeagle (May 16 2015).I considered an interior visit (\u00a320 per person) and heard that this place was included in the National Rail '2-for-1' offer but when we went up to London could not find it included in that offer in the National Rail Booklet with its vouchers, so we went somewhere else instead.I sent a message to Westminster Abbey asking why this was. Someone there eventually bothered to reply, several weeks later. They informed me that the Abbey was indeed included in the offer (so why wasn't it in the rail booklet?) and 'the scheme runs until 15th April'. The message was sent to me on 11th April, so a fat lot of good that was!!!What a pity I cannot award ZERO stars.This is undoubtedly a great and historically important building but if the Christian Dean and Chapter who run it (who undoubtedly know a thing or two about some writings of 2000 and more years ago but precious little about service to the paying guest in the modern day) can treat you in such an incompetent manner perhaps it is time that such a nationally and internationally important edifice was taken over and managed by another organisation or even by the Government.I would be very interested to see if they bother to respond to this as I know they read all these reviews.If you pay the money and go inside you'll almost certainly enjoy it, but why not just admire the magnificent exterior (as I do now) and visit one or more of the many other visitor attractions in this area instead? St. Margaret's Church is beside this and is well worth the effort.You can attend services in the Abbey (there are 28 each week) and this is one way you could at least see part of the interior without paying the steep admission fee, which is too high for those with limited means."

Many agitated visitors walked away as their 'plans' did not give them time to wait. Audio tour very basic. Recommend full guide book for a better understanding. Only limited toilet facilities inside (another 10 minute queue - good job I wasn't desperate). Staff managed inside numbers well however. Not overly crowded inside, which was probably part of the problem with the queue outside. RECOMMEND you get there early i.e. just before official opening time to minimise waiting. Museum worth a visit."

The church, itself, is just lovely...with so many different alcoves and rooms. It is a must see on any London visit."

Rather than pay to get into the cathedral we attended one of many free services as our time was limited and we were there on a Sunday. The down side is that you can't take pictures at all when you are inside (at least not so they can see you!), but the up side is you can worship in the abbey. We went to a free organ recital which was incredible. The main thing we noticed about the church was how much of it was for the glory of man....the kings, the queens..... Didn't seem to be much about Christ or the disciples. However, it is a beautiful cathedral. My favorite picture is after the service as we are outside leaving the abbey, the priest comes out in his red robes and is shooing everyone away as it's time for the choral matins. Most churches are trying to get people to come in, but not Westminster Abbey."

Before we began our tour, we went into the Dean's Courtyard to a small restaurant for lunch. During the tour, we had audio guides which were very helpful. Westminster Abbey has been the place where royalty has been crowned, married, and buried since 1066. The architecture of the building is incredible. We saw the exact spots where Queen Elizabeth II was crowned and where Prince William married Kate Middleton. The Lady Chapel has beautiful stained glass windows and an incredible ceiling. We saw many tombs of kings and queens and others important in English history. Particularly interesting was Poet's Corner. in this section were plaques and memorials honoring the great English poets and writers: Dickens, Shakespeare, Tennyson, and so many more. There is also an Air Force chapel. The stained glass window has religious figures in it along with pilots and parachutes. It is a tribute to WWII flyers. Our audio guides led us through each part of the Abbey explaining each section as we went.After our tour and after an ice cream break, we went back for the Evenson service and are so glad we did. The church had been cleared of tourists. Worshippers were led in and seated for the service. Evensong lasted about an hour and was beautifully done. This is such an historic place and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing it."

IF you know anything about English history, this is a must see site. Consider looking at this SANCTUARY from its religious origins. Take time to read about its history (as you will be in a very important neighborhood of London). So why consider the RELIGOUS origins of the Abbey ? Because even TODAY there are services conducted by the Church of England, here. Bases upon my multiple personal visits, I recommend you plan your trip so that you spend an hour that overlaps during a weekday Choral Evensong OR a Sunday Choral Worship service. These traditions of the Anglican communion are visible now CENTURIES, later and practiced in a way that brings glory to God. This is NOT a review to suggest changing whatever your religious beliefs might be --- but just listening to the choral music of English masters will refresh your soul...Remember: WA is still used for official events, so plan ahead if you are from out of town to not be disappointed if it is closed for such official events.

It is over 700 years old and is located in central London, in close proximity to Big Ben and The Thames River. It is one of the most notable religious buildings in England and has been the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and, now, British monarchs. The building is no longer an abbey or a cathedral, having instead the status of a 'Royal Peculiar' \u2013 a church responsible directly to the Sovereign.Daily worship services are held at Westminster Abbey. Services are open to the public. The abbey is open to tour on most days from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Self-guided tour tickets are 20 pounds per adult, this includes an audio guide. The history that Westminster Abbey holds is engrossing and the architecture is quite spectacular. Of particular interest are the Cloisters, Lady Chapel, High Altar, the beautiful stained glass windows, the choir, and the Poets Corner. No pictures are allowed inside, but we were able to capture the beauty of open areas and the architectural majesty. It takes several hours to appreciate the abbey.

The Abbey itself is impressive and beautiful, but the real intrigue comes from all the kings and queens who are buried there. To walk past the tomb of Queen Elizabeth or Victoria is just incredible, or to walk past those of Kings from 700 years ago is amazing. The fact that coronations, royal weddings and funerals have taken place here is also quite awe-inspiring. The entry fee can seem steep, but it's reasonable for the sheer sense of history in the place. If you're on a budget but you love history, come here. If you just want impressive churches, maybe head over to St Paul's. Ideally, see both!"

Yes, it costs a fee to get in, but that fee includes an excellent audio guide and access to as many places as are open at that time. Plus \u2013 come on, people. The abbey doesn\u2019t get any funding from anyone but the visitors (which I find confusing), so all the restoration and upkeep is paid for by you!The only thing that made me sad is that pictures are not allowed within the Abbey. I understand it, I think, but it would have been nice to be able to have pictures of some of the plaques within Poet\u2019s Corner, or some of the awesome stained-glass windows dotting the walls. I gladly would have paid a \u201cphoto pass\u201d fee to have that privilege.We were both immediately struck not only by the architecture \u2013 soaring ceilings, marble and granite and gilt covering almost everything, intricate carvings everywhere you looked \u2013 but by the history as well. Yes, it\u2019s a theme that I keep coming back to \u2013 so much history! Tombs for kings and queens, memorials for poets and artists and musicians, paintings that were created 700 years ago, floors that are just as old, stain glass windows that partially survived the years and WWII, it just didn\u2019t end. Every nook held a piece of London\u2019s history. Every room had a story. And most things were displayed in an easy-to-understand-and-follow kind of way.The Abbey does tend to get crowded, so I would recommend going early, if at all possible. We got there about half an hour after they opened their doors, and it was just starting to get stifling. By the time we left, the crowd index was insanely high.I love that you\u2019re allowed to walk at your pace, and to take your time in viewing all the history surrounding you. It\u2019s amazing to me the things they have on display \u2013 that they were recovered, that they\u2019re in such fine condition, that they leave them within touching distance of some of the more oblivious tourists\u2026I\u2019d say it took us about two and a half hours to get through everything, what with the audio tour and fighting the crowds. There were a few things closed that day \u2013 the gardens and the little cloister, to be specific \u2013 but there\u2019s still plenty to see."

It's not the cheapest venue in London but if you take your time and look at all the history on display it provides an experience that is both rich and fulfilling taking the visitor through over 1000 years of British history , and the excellent audio tour is included in the price. The Abbey has manywell-known spots, you can tell these because the bulk of your fellow visitors will congregate there, but there are areas in which fewer visitors linger which have plenty to offer. I found that some of the side chapels, especially in the older part of the Abbey were very atmospheric and bore the marks of previous users over the millennia. The Chapter House and Museum are some other less popular areas of note, the former having some of the finest and ancient of carvings and paintings in English history and the latter as well as being in one of the oldest parts of the Abbey has a fascinating display of items from royal funerals. I love this place, and whilst you can do the visit in around 90 minutes would recommend that you slow down and value the sense of history and occasion the Abbey offers"

This is a church, which has been standing for almost one-thousand years. It has great Gothic architecture and interior design. I visited this place on August 2014, and the queue line to enter the church was really long due to the summer vacation period. The regular admission fee to enter the church is quite pricey (\u00a3 20.00 !). Fortunately, I am still a (graduate) student, so at that time I presented my student card and got \u00a3 3.00 discount (luckily). When I entered, there were some people who offered free audio guide, which was very useful to learn the history of this church if you travel alone without any tour guide.My sole intention to visit this place was to pay my respects to my most favorite scientist of all time: Sir Isaac Newton (I am definitely a nerd), who was buried here few century ago. I became aware of his burial place from a famous passage in \"The Da Vinci Code\": \"In London lies a knight a Pope interredHis labour's fruit a Holy wrath incurredYou seek the orb that ought be on his tombIt speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb \"I later found out that there were many famous British scientists buried here as well, i.e. Charles Darwin, Sir. J.J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, and also memorials dedicated to many famous British scientists who was buried elsewhere, i.e. Lord kelvin (William Thompson), Paul A.M. Dirac, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell, James Prescott Joule. However, since this is basically a church, taking photographs are not allowed. I didn't aware of that in the beginning, and I took some pictures inside the church. Later some security personnel approached and told me that I should stop taking pictures. They explained that since Westminster Abbey is basically a church, so taking pictures (with generates sound and flash) may disturb other visitors experience who may come to Abbey for worshiping purpose. So, please be aware of this situation before you buy the admission ticket. For me, I may say that the experience inside the Abbey is worth the admission fee."

Alongside all of these are magnificent tombs to the rich and famous of former times, many with effigies or other memorial statuary. Then there's the coronation chair, the wonderful Cosmati mosaic floor, the tomb of the unknown soldier and the magnificent vaulted ceiling. The 10' tall Waterford glass chandeliers look only a fraction of their true size when viewed against that vast Gothic height. Poet's corner boasts memorials to all the great names of English literature, though not all are actually buried there. Geoffrey Chaucer is and his monument was the first in that area of the abbey.This only touches the surface of what's to see at Westminster Abbey. Give yourself plenty of time, and for a really magical experience wait on for Evensong. Also, I took the verger's tour which casts an extra \u00a35. Well worth the money."

I learned so much, I started to question the sanity of the ruling class of this country. Sheesh!The rest room situation is a little odd. There are maybe 5 or 6 water closets out back with one attendant making sure everyone stays in line. There is no men's room or ladies room. They are all for both, so it truly is first come first relieved. Again, the line move quick enough, and the attendant seemed to be paying attention enough to resupply as needed.

Everyone we spoke to was very knowledgeable and friendly, and seemed to have their own favourite bit to talk about.There is so much history in one building, you could easily spend a few hours wandering around.There was lots of people visiting at the same time, but we didn't feel rushed, or pushed etc at any point.Don't miss the cloisters area, and the oldest door in England, and of course the Coronation Chair."

Not only is the building itself historic, having been the site of many royal coronations and weddings, but it has become a tribute and monument to some of the most influential (and in some cases controversial) people in English history. You can't turn a corner and not bump into a name that comes straight out of your history book. Memorials and/or graves of Newton? Darwin? Chaucer? Kings and queens? Check, check, check, and check. Add to that the splendid beauty of the cathedral and it is no wonder why this site is so popular and a \"must do\" for visitors. But with the popularity comes some problems. The queue and crowds were crazy, with lots of pushing and shoving through the many tight spaces throughout the building. Over the years the constant stream of visitors have also caused deterioration of many of the monuments and statues inside. This damage goes back hundreds of years, and adds a layer of... charm? history? not sure what to call it, but even the coronation chair has been heavily abused over the years, but it still gets called into service, engravings of childhood initials included! But that's part of Westminster. That's history. A few things to note about your visit. Expect crowds, and there are lots of tight spaces. So be prepared. Also download the tour app for your phone (it is free) and use headphones to carve off some personal \"space\". I used noise cancelling headphones and it really helped isolate my experience, even though I was in the middle of a sea of people. Visit the undercroft as well - it is included in the tour and has some interesting relics as well. Minus one star because of the 20 pound entry fee. Ouch!"

We were on a wait list for the abbey led tours that only allow 20 people. HIGHLY recommend you do that as only a select few people get to go into the old St. Edwards chapel and this is how you get in. It was worth the 5 pounds/person cost. We ended up doing the tour and then leaving because you could get in later the same day and it was getting crowded. That was a smart move because when we got there later in the afternoon it was after the school groups had left. Much calmer to visit and see things. We visited during lent so they were doing prayer every hour (not sure if that is year round).

Also, if you plan to visit do keep in mind this is still a place of worship, and if they ask you to be still and observe a moment of silence, do it. Put the audio on pause and respect the customs. Also, if you must entertain your children with electronic devices such as phones or handheld games be courteous and turn the volume off.

Firstly, the Lady Chapel is stunning and well worth visiting, but I resent having to pay \u00a320 to visit one of our 'National treasures' - St Paul's is much better value (and they do 2 for 1)! Lots of tombs and memorials, but you are shepherded along and it is busy - I think it is overpriced but I appreciate that the cost of upkeep is staggering. Personally, I would rather pay less for admission and give a donation or spend money in the Abbey Shop.The advertised 'Fast Track' if you buy tickets on-line beforehand does not really work. We ended up queuing for 30mins in the queue along with people paying by credit card (the queue for paying by cash was longer) so don't bother booking ahead, just use your credit card, it's the same queue.I was very disappointed that photography was not allowed. Like most people, I like to take personal photos of what interests me, and then share them with friends and family. How can you show how good somewhere is if you can't show them a photo? Yes, there is the opportunity to buy postcards at the Abbey Shop, but I want my own photo-memories, not someone else's. Please, Westminster Abbey, follow the example of St Pauls and charge visitors for a photo pass (\u00a32, I think) - more revenue for the Abbey and more memories for visitors (and the chance that the photos they take will entice more visitors).Having said all that, the Lady Chapel is truly stunning - wonderful architecture and visually stunning. It is probably worth the admission fee for this on its own."

We had 2for1 attraction vouchers, which was great as full price seemed a bit too much afterwards.The Abbey is nice - full of history, interesting facts from the past, ancient tombs and a very special atmosphere. Audio guide system is good, but unfortunately there was (and probably will always be) some people unable to pay attention to anything else but the magical voice in their ear. A place worth visiting, yes. Would I go there again? No. Make most of it and go there after lunch or full English brekkie, as it will take time to explore everything there is to see. There is a caf\u00e9, but it's well overpriced and their food is quite a disaster."

I really enjoy London walks as they are good value for money (especially if you get a two for one offer with the rail card deal) & the guides are all execellent. However I was disappointed with the expensive price to actually get in to see the abbey. There is a lot of British and religious history in the place and there is much to see. But it seems more like a museum than a place of worship. Now I know maintaining a historic place of worship costs money as I work in one but with the millions that visit annually does it really need to charge 20\u00a3 and ask for donations? Westminster Cathedral up the road has no entry charges. Neither does Southwark cathedral. Please consider lowering the entry fee. Are there other ways to raise revenue? Concerts? Art events? Exhibitions? I did enjoy the visit but I would be reluctant to become a regular visitor."

We went in September 2014 and spent a couple of hours wandering around the interior, marvelling at the beauty and the history of the building. The best way to visit is to pre book your tickets and then you can avoid the long lines. There are audio guides available, which I suggest you get as they offer a lot of information and point out focal points you may otherwise miss. There are many famous people buried there or their ashes, people such as Jane Austen, Mary Queen of Scott's, Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens, Tennyson, and many many more. There is also a tomb for \"The Unknown Soldier\" where the Queen laid a wreath. This is to honour all the men and women who have died serving their country. We also found a tomb for a person who when we worked out the date of his death was 152years old. We wondered if we had read it wrong and so asked one of the many helpers of the Abbey, and he was happy to give us some information. He said that Thomas Parr was supposedly 152 years and 9 months old when he died. We soon had a lot of people gathered around to hear the tale of Thomas Parr's life and death. Westminster Abbey is full of history and definitely worth spending a few hours looking around."

However, there is a lot to take in and the audio guide may have been better. That said - there is probably too much for the general visitor to see everything. If you have a specific interest in art or religious history, etc. you may need a longer or multiple visits.The Abbey is set up such that there is an assigned route to be followed. It is not too obvious but is intended to ease congestion in some areas. The Abbey gets very busy with some larger school and college groups.Overall a very interesting and historical building."

There were a fair few people inside but it wasn't overly crowded and very easy to see everything. I was a little disappointed you can't take photos inside, but given it is a working church, it is understandable. And once inside, the history of the place is just amazing.

The poets corner was equally educational and was such a touching sign of respect to those whose works live on even today. It was rather expensive to enter but I am so pleased I have seen the building and will not forget the experience."

            "review": "Westminster Abbey - Excellent but Expensive. There are few places on earth like Westminster Abbey for sheer history. There is simply too much to see in one visit and here in lies part of the problem. Receiving no government funding the Abbey has to stand on it's own two feet and that mean the entry fee is expensive (like many of London's famous attractions). At \u00a320 per head (\u00a317 concessions) and family tickets at \u00a345 (family of 4) you certainly get your monies worth to be sure, but it is a lot of money and more people would be able to view this marvellous place if it were cheaper. This is no fault of the Abbey.....and i will leave the politics there.On top of your ticket however it is worth getting the Verger guided tour. I have been many times but for the sake of the family i happily tagged along. Two very quick hours later i was still enthralled by the really excellent guided tour (and i really hate guided tours).The bonus is you get into some areas that general ticket holders do not.For those who do not want the guided tour the language ear phones are available in many languages and seemed well received.Reminder that this is a working Abbey so it is closed on Sundays and best to check there are no major national events going on before you plan your visit. In addition Saturdays are very busy. You can book tickets in advance and i found this to be a good idea.Still it is the Abbey and worth seeing once in your life time."

The Abbey, with its own history spanning over a millenium, marks the last resting places of many Kings (and Queens) of England, and famous poets, authors, politicians, explorers, scientists and others who have contributed to the development of the country and its civilisation, especially in the last 500 years, are all remembered here. A must for every tourist genuinely interested in the changing culture of England over the ages."

Fortunately, it is worthwhile going in to gaze at the site of some of England's important historical events. Coronations have been taking place here for hundreds of years. Funerals of noteworthy personalities have been held here. Oliver Cromwell's body was dug up 2 years after he was buried, decapitated and hung. He is no longer here.The most beautiful part is the Lady's Chapel with its white stone carved ceilings. The Quire where the choir sings is also interesting with its carved wooden panels. When it was a Benedictine abbey, this is where they would sing their prayers 7 times a day. There are royalty buried here, butit is the Poets' Corner that appeals to most visitors. Here, you will find the graves of Charles Dickens, the Austens, Tennyson, Lord Byron and lots more.We all enjoyed our visit, including my nephew who's only 8 years old.

It was not busy and there was plenty of room to linger at strategic points. Visitors enter at the North door just by the front door of St Margaret's (in itself an interesting place). Entrance fees are a bit steep but not bad if you remember how much it costs to keep the building in good repair - \u00a320 adult (only \u00a310 at York Minster and Durham is free but donations welcome), \u00a317 concession for students and old people like us. Free if you live in Westminster, and it seems that Parish Churches can get free passes for their members.Included is an audio guide which is not too verbose and quite adequate.The Royal Tombs are indeed awe inspiring, from St Edward right up to the Tudors. Later regal burials are marked by simple engraved tiles in the floor and are very easy to miss.The Lady Chapel is incredibly beautiful and houses the first Tudor King, who built it!, and his wife.But there are other interesting things too see at the end of the Abbey itself, not least the architecturally stunning Chapter House with medieval tiled floor, the lovely gardens, and the quirky little museum with many death effigies. A recently opened undercroft restaurant serves excellent if very expensive food. Soup and a sandwich costs an arm and a leg but you can see prices before you go in. We stayed on for Choral Evensong, sublime. Of course, if you just want to go to a service (Evensong at 5 every day, not always sung) no entrance fee. But if you want to sit in the Quire for Evensong it is as well to join the queue at the Great West Door at least 30mins early. There are also free organ recitals on a Sunday (see website).There are toilets off the South Transept (Poets' Corner) and next to the restaurant."

The Henry VII chapel is the real highlight; the rest of the building can't compete. The Museum didn't really add much to the visit for me: some of the effigies of Kings and Queens past were interesting to see but the rest of the collection wasn't worth a look. My only criticism is that some of the audio guide commentary is very brief and there is not much - if any - information given about the various people buried in the floor/memorialized along the walls as you walk from the entrance to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and up the Nave. This area includes Prime Ministers, statesmen, explorers, military figures and others yet you would miss them entirely if you were not carefully looking where you were standing."

These factors aside, Westminster Abbey is a joy. It oozes history from every stone, it fascinates, amazes, and should be on the itinerary of every visitor to the Capital. From Queen Elizabeth I's grand tomb, to Anne of Cleves tiny niche, this building is British history encapsulated in ancient stone."

I have travelled to London many times over the years but had never visited Westminster Abbey until a few weeks ago and then realised what I had been missing. Wonderful architecture and sense of history. Quite an amazing place. My favourite bits - the ceilings, the tomb of Mary Queen of Scots, and Poets Corner. We arrived just after 10am on a weekday morning and the queue was not very long, took just over five minutes to get to the entrance. I did think that the entrance fee of \u00a320 was a lot (\u00a317 for seniors). However it does include a free audio guide that you collect once you are in. We took around 1 1/2 hours to go round but I am sure it could easily take longer if you linger."

Memorials and sanctuaries abound in remembrance of the great, the good and sometimes the not so good. All are described on the audio-guide included with the entrance fee.After a brief bag search we quickly passed into the abbey. We had paid on-line and so our e-ticket was scanned. We picked up a very easy to use hand-held electronic voice guide with Jeremy Irons to emphasise the depth and wealth of history of this building.My most memorable moment was being alone in a side chapel with the tomb and thus remains of Queen Elizabeth First and her older sister Queen Mary.School parties abound, just wait for each wave to pass; or, go in early.Yes, it is very expensive, but worth it."

I was here on Wednesday I had a great day.On entering I thought \u00a320 is a bit steep for this sort of attraction and was gutted to find photos weren't allowed - yrs there's some postcards in gift shop but not of the things I wanted. I had hoped that like Carlisle cathedral you could buy a permit to take pics...First time around wasn't great as I hadn't been given one of the audio handsets but a member of staff sorted me out and I started again, next time i might prefer an actual tour.Highlights were - seeing where the coronation and royal wedding took place, mary queen of scots, poets corner, memorial to baden Powell and the oldest door in Britain. Liked I could light a candle. The place is steeped in history and the ceilings are just amazing I spent a few hours and could have spent longer. Special mention to the toilet attendant - what a lovely man :) Will return. Please consider if there are any suitable places for pics inside :)  "

Amazing to see the intricacy of all the tombs of past kings and queens. They give you a free audio guide which tells the fascinating stories surrounding some of the people buried there. The level of detail in everything they have done is amazing and just looking up at the ceilings or stained glass is a site to behold. Have done almost every major attraction but nothing compares to this. You know you are a part of history while you are inside."

At the entrance, you can get an audio guide to help you during your visit. The audio guide provides some details that you can't notice without it (for instance, a whole on a wall of the cathedral, made during the London Blitz (1940-1941) You have to travel inside on a fixed path - and you can't come back. So, walk slowly, paying attention to every plate - on the wall and on the ground! Lots of historic characters there and you may miss an important person every time. So, if you love history, spend 2 to 3 hours in Westminster Abbey. In my case, I was really interested in Isaac Newton's tomb. Darwin and Shakespeare are not buried there, but there are some tributes to them. Visit every single chamber so that you don't miss an important king or queen."

Love cathedral architecture but this one is so full of monuments to people that its difficult to get a clear view of the inside of the building. If you are a history buff (with 20 pounds to spare) you will enjoy the audio tour but there is so much inside that there is no way for the tour to cover it all. Do check out the 14 century paintings in the Chapter House.Personally I prefer the look of a cathedral like York Minster or even St. Paul's. They aren't so crammed full of marginal history, monuments to rich people who didn't want anyone to forget them."

Nice restaurant for something to eat as well and a small shop for the kids to buy something to take home! Toilet facilities were not the cleanest (which was surprising to us)."

Again is a self guided tour with an audio (if you can choose the English one as is Jeremy Irons' voice and that's definitely a plus) I know it's very difficult to fit the whole story without making the tour too long, but in my case at the end of it i found myself wanting more. History can be a hell of a story but in westminster's case is just little tips of what happened or about the people who's buried there. Enjoyable, yes... but i was honestly left with a sense of... not enough."

When I visited, (early afternoon on a December Wednesday) there was no queue and it wasn't too busy inside. I had plenty time to linger at the most impressive tombs (Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots). Expensive? Yes, but I'll probably not visit again so as a one off, it's not.

If you are going during a busy time, I recommend getting there 15-20 minutes before opening time, otherwise you may face quite long queues. Call ahead and book a verger guided tour. It costs 5 gbp more than the general admission (which includes the audio guide). Only 20 people are allowed on each tour, and a verger personally takes you through the Abbey and explains things to you. You get to go places that you otherwise cannot with the audio guide (most notably, the shrine of Edward the Confessor, where Kate and William signed their marriage license after their wedding).The Abbey is quite large, and you cannot take photos inside. Plan for at least a few hours for a visit. There are so many famous and important people buried here that you will lose count. Also, I initally tried not to step on the graves of people, but quickly realized that it was physically impossible to do so, so don't worry about it when you are there. Sometimes the Abbey carries weird hours. If you can't get in for a tour, definitely go to a service, Evensong if you can. The Westminster boy's choir sings at many of these services, and they are quite impressive."

The building is unbelievable beautiful. The masonry and the ceilings are out of this world. I was able to light a candle for a loved one which felt special. There are a lot of tombs! Poets corner is interesting to look around. Then outside are the cloisters and you can easily visualise its' origins as an abbey. You can see the spot where the coronations take place as well as the coronation chair itself. All very interesting. We did not take any children - they may find it interesting if they were doing kings and Queens at school ! They do a family ticket which seemed good value. One hour was just about enough time.

The greats of english history or buried here as well as being place where so much history has been made over the centuries. The whole area is beautiful with statues and memorials. It is well worth the time to take the tour and get more of the details of the history in this Abbey. It is small area and with a lot of tourists it is difficult to get around. I enjoyed the Poet's Corner as have a special interest in Chaucer. You can probably get to see all that is of interest in about an hour, so does not take too long. Using the the audio tour is also a good choice. Be sure to go to the Abbey Museum and see the exhibit of the clothing made for the Kings and Queens and the mannequins they used. Very interesting. Also, the Abbey shop has good selection of souvenirs and interesting items to buy. Downstairs of the shop you can get some nice tapestries."

The only downside is the fact it costs nearly $30 US to enter (you can get in for free if you are there for worship, but I didn't see anyone doing that). It seems a bit pricey, I recall it being only about half that price a few years ago. I understand the need for upkeep, but the price is becoming prohibitive and turning many away from a truly iconic landmark in England.My average review is due to the price, not the content, which is magnificent...I hate to see others turn away from such a treasure due to the cost."

You can hire an audio guide, but we didn't see these till nearly finished (the crowd entering may have hidden them from our view when we went in. The lady at the ticket entrance didn't point it oiut to us either. Most places wnat to get an extra bob or two by having the audio guide, but after the entrance few I would possible not have paid for it anyway. This was not my first time in London, but it was the first time I gave into temptation to enter this sight. I will never have to do it again. And wouldn't have done it in the first place if I knew how dissapointing it would be.You will recognise a few of the names on the tomes and stones on the floors and walls, Newton, Livingstone, the Queens and Kings gone by. I would expect that the audio guide may have made it a better experience, but the entrance fee is so high it should be included in the entrance.I think it was said on the very poor leaflet that was given to me at entrance (and it was not a history guide) that thousands visit each day - so at \u00a318 a head x 1000 equals \u00a318000-00 a day good money if you can get it.....Not worth the visit (at that price) but unfortunately its a place that is on everyones list."

His knowledge of the Abbey's history and his presentation skills are fantastic. The building is magnificent and the number of historical figures buried or represented there is astounding. The cost of the tour is only \u00a35 more than the entry fee and is the best value. There are only a few tours per day and limited to 20 people per tour, so best to call a day ahead of your visit to the information desk and get on the list. You still need to wait in line and buy an entry ticket so arrive well in advance of your tour starting time.In addition to the insights of the Verger guides, you get access to the choir stalls and the chapel of Edward the Confessor. These are very memorable.If you are touring London, don't miss Westminster Abbey. If you visit the Abbey, don't miss the Verger tour."

There is the Pantheon in Rome, Notre Dame in Paris, or St. Patrick's in New York, but none really compare to the sense of true awe that is Westminster Abbey. This is the place of coronations and marriage, funerals and average Sunday Christian Worship of the Who's Who of England. Not as large as St. Paul's, it is big on the names on its stones. Here is a chance to walk among the wise and famous. We suggest taking a tour as the best way of seeing it, although everywhere you turn there is glimpse into the glorious past. Even an atheist will sense that this church is special. No photos, lots of people, do not be rushed."

It's simply overwhelming, too much, to fully grasp the enormity of the history and the importance of this particular building, from the actual events that have taken place there which are too many to list, to the royalty actually buried there under your feet, to the poets and novelists who proudly take their place among the monarchs. It's not so much a 'church' as a living, breathing testament to the history - both tragic and glorious - of Britain. Yes, it's expensive to get in, but surely worth every penny, and as others have said, if you go at Evensong you get even more of an impression of the Abbey's ongoing importance."

The event was ticketed and sold out quite quickly, and we were so excited to have been a part of the mass. The sheer size of the abbey is breathtaking. It is absolutely immense...not your average parish. It terms of the history, you can't even begin to imagine the events that place has seen. Not only has it hosted hundreds of coronations, weddings, and funerals, but it also serves as the burial site of some of the most influential minds of the past hundreds of years. It is an absolute must see, I cannot stress that enough! The earlier you go, the better to avoid the crowds. Keep in mind too that it is only open for services on Sunday, although seeing the abbey for its main use is a wonderful way to get the full experience.Happy travels!"

There was a very large queue but the Abbey staff (all very pleasant and welcoming) were organised about getting us inside quickly. Once (free) tickets were checked, seating inside was unallocated (apart from the choir reserved for VIPs). We sat in the nave which seemed to be favoured by most of the congregation. However, I understand from friends who had been before that the sound of the choir is actually better balanced with the organ if you sit in the transept (and choosing the transept also gives you the chance to walk through and see more of this stunning church). Bear in mind that there is no public transport in London late on Christmas Eve. You may be able to get there by bus or tube, but it's a walk or taxi home (unless you have a car and there is easy parking nearby on Christmas Eve at this time). In summary, the service was very nice, the choir is fantastic, the church itself is just amazing, and it was very nice that all the clergy were outside at the end to greet the vast congregation. I'm not religious at all, but I must say I left with a very good impression of the Church of England. Well done Westminster Abbey."

And the weather plays no part as , for me, the colder and duller it is the more atmospheric it is. If you're planning a journey always check that there's no ceremony or Royal visit on your day which happens frequently and will mean much of the Abbey is closed before, during and just after each visit. I taught at Westminster Abbey for many years so I got to experience the Abbey on a weekly basis (hence my warning about closures during events) and I can honestly say that every single time I arrived I'd notice something new, something different something I'd not noticed before.

Here are my tips for your first Westminster Abbey experience:- Don't rush through the first section of the Abbey because you won't be coming back to it later. You buy your tickets at the North entrance, walk inside and immediately you're given an audio guide. The first chapter of the audio guide kind of rushes you into the nave. But make sure to take your time in the first part of the Abbey because it has some amazing art and you won't return to it later in your self-guided tour. Dictate your own pace through the abbey - don't let the audio guide rush you through.- The Abbey is pretty expensive to visit (\u00a318 per person) but well worth the price. If you absolutely cannot pay the \u00a318, you can still see the beautiful nave by going to a service or one of the Abbey's many free events. In addition to doing the audio tour, I went to a 30 minute organ recital on Sunday night (check the online schedule) and it was excellent! Hearing such a masterful musician play the world class instrument inside the beautiful and resonant space was well worth my time! Make sure and queue up outside the abbey at the west entrance 30+ minutes in advance.- To warn you \u2013 there is no photography or recording inside the abbey. Photography is allowed in the cloisters and garden.- Plan on allowing yourself at least 1.5 hours to look around."

There's great photos to take outside of the amazing Gothic architecture but it's a shame that as with so many historic buildings that you cannot take pictures inside as there are so many monuments and structures to remember. There is a specific route to take around the building ( all ground floor) with a hand held audio guide included although I'm the type that could have done with extra literature on many of the tombs and plaques as I enjoy history. Toilets are towards the end of the route but the many staff will open up the cordons to let you through if like me you can't wait that long ! Don't forget that this is a place of worship so quietness is encouraged as services do take place as you are slowly drifting along. I will definitely be revisiting once I have researched more about Henry III, ELizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots etc"

I got there about an hour prior to opening and only had a small line prior my arrival. Maybe 50 people. By opening time, the line stretched around the block. My first bit of advice, GET THERE EARLY! Lots kings and queens buried here. So much history. It's just amazing and like going back in a time warp. My only negatives is that no photography or video allowed inside. There is security everywhere and they watch people with cameras pretty closely. Don't know what happens if you get caught. Once the crowds build inside, it's kind of hard to take pictures anyway because there are so many people in the way. Allot about 3-4 hours to see it all. \u00a318.00 or about $25.00 for admission and for me it was worth every penny. If you like history, it's a must see."

The original building was established in the 11th century by King Edward the Confessor although has been changed over the centuries. It is built in a gothic style and for anyone who has visited other famous England cathedrals (ie Salisbury, York Minster etc) you will find it externally quite underwhelming. However, despite what you think it is certainly worth the ridiculous 17 pound fee to get in. Internally it possesses some of Englands greatest treasures, as well as the resting places of its most famous & influential including most monaches from Henry III to George II, Sir Issac Newton, Charles Darwin , Dickens, etc. There is no photo\u2019s allowed inside, which to be honest is probably a good thing. It does get quite crowded, although people push through at a decent rate. There is normally a queue outside, although once again this pushes by at a reasonable pace. It\u2019s a \u2018must do\u2019 for anyone in London, regardless of whether you have been to other famous England cathedrals before. Given yourself 2-2.5 hours."

It is well lit and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. We went straight to the front of a very long queue thanks to having granny with us aged 90! You need stamina to get the best out of this visit. We skimmed over much of it just gawping at the amazing number of plaques and burial spots of lots of historical figures...Darwin, Gladstone, Kings and queens etc. the most moving part for me was the tomb of the unknown soldier. I loved the words on the tomb. However, the tomb that really amazed me was that of Elizabeth 1st. Her face is actually her likeness as it was taken from her death mask.The stained glass is fantastic and you can stop for prayers/ silent reflection at various times. The hand held interactive commentary was very useful although Jeremy Irons' voice did start to grate after a while. When one of the guides found out it was our first visit and that granny had a special birthday - he spent time showing us some personal photos of the wedding cake sent to all the cathedral staff after Kate and Will's wedding...a lovely touch.The loos are fab and the caf\u00e9 was fine - although it is underground. Hot chocolate was good.I was initially irritated that I couldn't take photos - but then relieved as it meant you had to really look at everything and absorb the atmosphere instead of clicking away. I would not have liked it to be any more crowded - so go early. Also save up! Cost us \u00a366 for 4 and that was despite a student pass and a senior ticket ( ouch!)"

If you have an interest in the history of Britain, you will find this a fascinating place, my only negative is the fact that in the side chapels so little written information on the lesser titled lords & ladies, it would help because few of us can read the Latin inscriptions."

I highly recommend buying a ticket and touring the inside--if you go later in the evening it will only take you about an hour and a half to get through it all (5:00 is a good time on a weekday). You can avoid the crowds that way. I also recommend picking up the free audio guide, because it takes you on a complete tour of Westminster Abbey, and informs you of a variety of interesting facts.

The tour is a fascinating timeline of British history, politics, music, and literature told through the Abbey's monuments. After you've done that, return again to attend one of the daily sung worship services. It's when the Abbey is serving its intended purpose -- as a place of worship -- that it really comes to life. On this visit, we attended the daily 5pm Choral Evensong. The monuments are largely off-limits before and after services so it doesn't replace the tour experience, it complements it. If you're fortunate enough to be in London in mid-October, the annual Edwardtide National Pilgrimage is the ultimate way to experience the Abbey from a spiritual perspective. You approach the visit as a pilgrim rather than a tourist. It's well worth it if you ever have the opportunity to attend. You can find details on the Abbey web site."

With your entrance ticket to Westminster, you get a free audioguide, which is very generous because a lot of other places make you pay extra for that. Surprisingly, Westminster seemed smaller than I thought, but that didn't take away from the grandeur of it. It was relatively crowded, but not unmanageable. The Verger tour was an additional fee (I think 5\u00a3). The group was myself, my husband and another person. So we definitely had a very individualized tour. At first, I thought we were moving so fast through the church, but he told us that with our ticket, we could go back through, even with an audioguide. The nice thing about the tour is that it is very informative. We saw a lot of interesting architectural features that we wouldn't have seen on our own. We also heard his personal stories about the royal wedding and other events he's been a part of. The best part was getting access to Edward the Confessor's tomb, which the general admission ticket doesn't let you see."

You will realise the scale and extent of British history that is far too great to describe here.This is utterly inspirational and should be compulsory for everyone!"

To be there in person where so much history has been played out was such a special experience. The complimentary audio guides were very nice to have too as it not only told what the history was and what rooms where what, but also acted as a sort of map as well. The Abbey is such an awe inspiring place and the bells are beautiful with the prayer at the top of the hour. To be able to actually be inside the chapel where HRH Prince William got married to Princess Kate was such a neat experience. Having gotten up at 4am to see their wedding on TV and later to be standing in the same place was amazing! My favorite place of all however, was the Poet's Corner, especially the C.S. Lewis memorial stone. As an avid reader of the classics, it meant so much to me to be able to see all of these memorials to the great classical writers whom I have read, but C.S. Lewis' stone was extra special for me. It was also so neat to be able to see the actual real Coronation Chair of the Royal Family! Pictures aren't allowed and it is rather expensive to go in, but visiting Westminster Abbey and seeing so much history and famous names was definitely a wonderful experience and I highly recommend it."

The tour costs 18 pounds but the services are free, so we informed the people at the gate we were there for the service and they welcomed us in. We entered the great West door about 2:45 and followed the rest of those there to do the same. Evensong is primarily a choir based service. It was inspiring and moving and lasted approximately 45 minutes. We sat, worshipped and appreciated the incredible surroundings.

The ability to be able to walk around to each chapel, see the age and beauty of some of the tombs was great. For the Tudors historians amongst us, the Lady Chapel is outstanding. To see the tombs of Mary I and Elizabeth I together, together in death if not in life, Henry VI and Elizabeth of York, Mary Queen of Scots and Margaret Beautfort is like seeing history right in front of you. Henry VIII is not buried here, he is buried at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

At least you'll come away with that impression after a visit to Westminster Abbey. With the French having trashed their royal tombs St. Denis during the Revolution, Westminster Abbey stands as the greatest collection of historical figures in Europe.This is History with a capital H. All the greats of English and later British royal history are bured here, as well as many notable historical leaders. The church is magnificent, but there are scores of great cathedrals all across Europe (including the above-mentioned St. Denis, the first great Gothic cathedral). But none of them has the breadth of historical sweep that you will find here. Kings and queens have been crowned here, then interred when their reigns were over. And in places like the Poets Corner, notable writers are buried or memorialized as well (not everyone who has a stone in the floor or walls of the Corner is in fact buried in Westminster Abbey). I definitely recommend the self-guided audio tour. It takes you to all the highlights (Queen Elizabeth I's tomb, the Poet's Corner, Chaucer's tomb), and lets you go at your own pace. While not cheap (nothing in London is), it's good value-for-money. And be sure to stay away on Sundays when the Abbey is an active, working church and tourists are kept out."

Although a bit expensive to enter and a bit of a wait, this was definitely worth it, especially when you learn how your entry fee contributes to the running of the Abbey. For a history-enthusiast like myself, this was almost too much to take in at once. The audio guides they give out (included in the entry fee) are brilliant and really gives back to your visiting experience. To be able to see the tombs of the old kings like Edward III and Henry V, as well as the Tudors, from Margaret Beaufort to Elizabeth I and her nemesis Mary Stuart was great, but the Abbey with the beautiful architecture and setting is worth a visit in itself."

You will learn about the history of the Abbey, why a church is actually called an Abbey, and also will get a very informative and interesting narration about all the British kings and queens, as well as other dignitaries buried there.

The only negative point is that it is not allowed anymore to take any pictures. The first time I visited in 1996, at least on one evening in a week picture taking was allowed. The official reasoning that it destroys the arts is SCIENTIFICALLY wrong and false (provided one doesn't use flash, and nowadays everybody should know how to switch flashlights off).The audioguide is for free and pretty informative. Unfortunately you cannot go inside without an entrance fee. Even 10 years ago you could at least enter the nave up to the very first altar to have a glimps into the church, in case the price is too high for your taste. Pictures below are from this year, interior pictures are from 1996 when it was allowed to take photographs, so the quality might be low, but it still might give you an impression why you should visit this place."

The architecture is stunning \u2013 as you would expect from a church approaching almost a 1,000 years in age \u2013 and if you think the outside is impressive\u2026 Well, regardless of your religious affiliation, everyone should enter a Gothic cathedral at least once in their lives.Before entering, you\u2019ll get to experience the solemn queue up to the ticket booth. The cost may seem a little high up front, but it\u2019s worth it. They do happen to have a military discount if you ask (student rate) and are eligible. Once inside, you\u2019re handed a map and a fairly high tech audio guide that comes with the entry price. From there, you listen to the sweet, sultry voice of Jeremy Irons as you follow the solemn queue on a winding path through the Abbey. At a few stops the audio guide, which has a little LCD screen, can also show short videos.I was visiting to see the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, but the Abbey is also known for honouring national figures such as scientists, poets, generals, Prime Ministers, as well as past Kings and Queens. Notables buried or commemorated within Westminster are the likes of Darwin, Newton, Chaucer, Dickens, and for the Canadians: General James Wolfe (tomb only \u2013 he\u2019s buried elsewhere). Many of the tombs are quiet elaborate, and some are surprising to even be present ie. Mary, Queen of Scots. Cromwell only has a marker, as he spent three years interred before being dug up and \u201cparted out.\u201dI would budget at least 2 hours to work \u2013 3 hours is better \u2013 your way through the Abbey. No photography is permitted within the church, which is understandable. Most of that time will be spent following the solemn queue, which bottle necks in a few areas \u2013 unavoidable with the design of the church and the crowds it receives. I don't think they planned for so many visitors back in 1245 AD. Once you\u2019ve exited the main hall of the cathedral, there\u2019s still the Westminster Abbey Museum to visit, as well as some of the surrounding gardens. Surprisingly, this is one of the few places where you won\u2019t \u201cexit through the gift shop.\u201d To reach it, you exit through the west door, head outside the fencing and turn left. Can\u2019t miss it. It also means that you can visit the shop without having to pay for admission. Finally, for those looking to worship without the tour, the church is still a church (surprise, surprise) and runs posted services. This option is free of the mandatory entrance fee during the \u201ctourist hours,\u201d but if you must absolutely, positively say a prayer outside of these service times you\u2019ll be required to pay for entry."

It was all tee'd up to be a true highlight for us. We are not particularly religious, but we love visiting churches. We love the architecture, the vaulting, the windows, everything. We visited 9 churches while were in England (in 10 days!). On a previous trip to Rome I visited more than 25 churches. We don't get \"church'd out.\"Despite our love for churches, Westminster Abbey was both a hit and a miss.The good:The Sunday evening organ concert was sublime. My husband is a musician, and one of his favorite things to do in Europe is hear organ concerts in different churches. You see, every organ is different. Many are built for a specific church with specific acoustics, and it's interesting to hear the differences between them. So we made a point to go to the organ concert one Sunday evening, and it was just incredible. The organist did a wonderful job, and the church staff made sure that the people visiting were there for the concert - not there to tour the Abbey. Did we get to walk around afterwards? No. But we got to be still in that place for about 45 minutes and just meditate and take it all in. Bonus: it's also free.The bad: We visited a second time a few days later, intending on it being our \"tourist visit\" to walk around. We made the mistake of visiting it after a tour of Parliament (which we LOVED, by the way), so we weren't first in line. By the time we got there it was absolutely mobbed with people... many of whom were trying to sneak a photograph here and there (photography is not allowed), and of course we got jostled around by multiple tour groups. It was crammed to the brim.It's also \"busy\" in terms of the number of plaques, monuments, markers, etc. you see. Let's be clear - many of these are grave markers. But many are not. Churchill, for instance, is not buried there. Yet, he has this massive marker at the entrance of the Abbey. Jane Austen is also not buried there. But she has a marker in Poet's Corner. How many people visit Westminster Abbey and think they saw where Jane Austen was buried? After we left, my husband called it \"the basement of the realm.\" It seemed to fit - if you're British and you're famous, your name will be on a plaque somewhere. In a way, it rather took away from the solemnity that we typically experience when visiting European churches. Between that and the mob of people, we were just turned off.So in conclusion: this is Westminster Abbey. Of course you have to visit. But I would also encourage a visit to some other churches in and around London. Of the 9 we visited during tourist hours, Westminster Abbey was actually our least favorite. Our favorite was probably Winchester Cathedral, closely followed by Canterbury Cathedral. Those places are truly awe-inspiring and manage to welcome tourists without losing their purpose."

A beatiful building inside out, and it is very hard to describe this exquisite place I am lost of words, I regret not going to this grand church before, for some reason I have explored the whole attractions in this area, the London Eye, London Aquarium, London Dungeons, maybe because they are well advertised and never felt the need to visit this stunning Abbey. I guess I was lucky today as I went with my son's school trip for The First World War Remembrance Day, and what an experience it was, the Westminister education center staff were amazing, they taught us about the First World War, showed us a short documentary, and a soldier shared his expereince, we then went on a tour, and then prayed at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior, the service was amazing. It is expencive to visit the Abby the charge for an adult is \u00a318.00 but worth every penny, I have not paid the fee to visit the Abbey but I will not hesitate going again and paying double the fee after my visit today so I can spend more time on my own or with my husband to see this amazing Abbey. It is a must see place is absolutley amazing. Every thing is astonishing and impressive and the employees are very helpful and ready to answer any question, a great holly and rich place to visit."

The Lady Chapel is breathtakingly beautiful. The admission fee includes an excellent self guided audio tour, and there are Abbey employees everywhere ready to answer questions and provide more detailed information than the audio guide (and they WILL most definitely notice if you attempt to photograph anything...spare yourself a genuine scolding and avoid it!) Every hour, a prayer is offered, a lovely touch, reminding visitors that the Abbey is still in use as a church. As such, it is closed on Sundays. We spent a leisurely two and a half hours here, but we did read every sign, see every chapel, every statue, every interesting bit of architecture, so that's probably longer than many would find necessary."

For anyone who has never visited this monumental religious attraction of London, then what are you waiting for. It is such an impressive building from when you first see it in the distance but it has so much more to offer when you are inside. The price was reasonable especially for a family and we all agreed that is so worth every penny spent. All of us were in awe at actually standing next to Kings, Queens, Prime MInisters, Poets, & Knights as well as many other famous names that we all recognise. The Abbey is so grand and anyone who says they did not enjoy it must be from a different planet. So much of our British history in one place is well worth the money and definitely a place we would all go back too."

I would go for the audio tour, since it walks you through the building in a good pattern, while hitting you with some of the history and letting you know why certain things are where they are. They make you walk through a gift shop on your exit, but it's up to you to shop. I didn't."

Cons: long queues even though we had prebooked a tour, a lot of security but understandable given what goes on these days. We couldnt see the Houses of Commons as parliament was in session.

We bought the guide which is full of pictures and information. It has taken pride of place in my son's room.If you are in London, visiting Westminster Abbey should be your number 1 place to visit!"

Trying to avoid all the crowds, we booked our tickets online \u2013 18.00 pounds each \u2013 and waited by the gate of the Abbey at least an hour before it was open. With time it did get crowded, though not as much as it would in any other time of the day. Once we set foot in the Abbey, we were excited to be surrounded with so much history, knowing so many greats have been part of it. Ever since its beginning, in the 10th century, the Abbey has been the place of coronations, commemorations, burials, and weddings, the first coronation being that of King Edward the Confessor. We saw many statues, memorial tables, and tombs, including the ones of Queen Elizabeth I, Mary I, Mary II, Edward III, Henry V, among others. Along with the royals, there can be found tombs and statues of many famous musicians, mathematicians, philanthropists, sailors, admirals, historians, writers, poets, architects, scientists, priests, and politicians. We were especially fascinated by the whole Poets Corner, thrilled to find so much literary grandeur in one place. Starting from memorial tablets of Jane Austen, the Bront\u00eb sisters, Edmund Spenser, William Tyndale, WH Auden, Keats, and Shelley; the statues of Shakespeare, Samuel Butler, Coleridge, and William Blake; the memorial stones of CS Lewis, George Eliot, Lord Byron, John Dryden, Lewis Carroll, and TS Eliot; the stained glass windows of Alexander Pope, Christopher Marlowe, Elizabeth Gaskell, John Milton, and Oscar Wilde; and the graves of Ben Jonson, Charles Dickens, Geoffrey Chaucer, Lord Tennyson, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Rudyard Kipling, Samuel Johnson, and Thomas Hardy. Among the tombs of other historic people, we were able to see those of David Livingstone, Lord Kelvin, Handel, Henry Purcell, and the famous scientists Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. We also found the memorial stones and tablets of famous people, such as Oliver Cromwell, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. It was touching to see many of the memorials of people who lost their lives in the two World Wars, whose bravery hasn\u2019t been forgotten. We enjoyed our visit and we recommend it to all history lovers."

We had tried to visit two days earlier, but there was an unscheduled event at the church that prevented us from entering. It did take us almost 20 minutes before we are able to get in. The moral is to arrive early and probably on a weekday rather than a weekend. At \u00a318 a person (\u00a315 for children/seniors), it is quite expensive for a \"church\" visit. You also get a really good audio tour in your fee. Guided tours are also available. Remember, no photos are allowed, though I'm not sure if I would want to take photos with all the memorials/graves.The abbey itself is smaller than St. Paul's Cathedral, but the sheer number and significance of the Britons buried here overrides St. Paul's. What's interesting is that the entire church is in essence a big cemetery, where people are interred in the ground, in the church walls, and more. The architecture is beautiful, though it doesn't match the splendor of St. Paul's. There are some substantial other things to see other than the graves - there is a small museum and gardens area.But what makes the place special is it's the burial place of many of the significant figures in British (and in many cases, world) history. You see graves everywhere, every step (a famous individual could be buried beneath your feet) - just every foot that you walk. The gravesites, coffins, whatever - many are elaborately decorated. In fact, many are so old that their letterings have faded from years of people walking over a stone, etc. The figures are just significant in history. I was especially interested that many scientists were buried there, including major figures such as Darwin, Maxwell, and Newton. You also have your requisite kings and queens and the royal family, but you also have poets and other literary masters as well. The audio tour provides great history and facts as you tour separate sections of the church."

It is now quaintly described as a Royal Peculiar responsible directly to the British monarchs. The coronations of British kings and queens are traditionally performed at this great abbey located near the Houses of Parliament.I can think of only one fair description of the interior of Westminster Abbey in London - almost impossibly beautiful! The exterior of this Gothic building is magnificent but the glorious interior of this national treasure surpassed any expectations held by my wife Dianne and I. My wife loves Gothic cathedrals and we had visited Notre Dame in Paris, Cologne Cathedral, and the Frauenkirche in Munich but the astonishing beauty of the interior of Westminster Abbey simply took our breath away. In our opinion, the interiors of those famous French and German cathedrals cannot match the beauty of Westminster Abbey. It is impossible for me to convey an impression of that beauty here because photography is not permitted inside the great abbey, but excellent interior views can be found at the online home of Westminster Abbey under the heading \"Abbey Treasures\" at http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/abbey-treasuresInside the abbey, the Gothic sculptured stonework and carved woodwork is magnificent. The decoration of the interior by master craftsmen is superb. Statues of famous people from English history are to be found on every side, as well as the burial tombs of historically famous people. Unfortunately, we visited Westminster Abbey in July 2014 when most of Europe, Asia and North America appeared to be on holiday and visiting London. Despite the dense throng of visitors to the abbey in July, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit but promised ourselves that we would try to visit again in late September or the first half of October when everyone is back at work or school. Entry to the Abbey is from 9:30 to 15:30. The admission charge per adult is \u00a318 and \u00a38 for schoolchildren (11 to 18). Children under 11 are admitted without charge if accompanied by an adult. My wife and I entered without paying as one of the benefits of our London Pass. Taxis are conveniently parked outside the abbey."

If your time is limited, you might want to look at a guide book or YouTube video to help you narrow down what is important and one of the many volunteers can point you in the right direction. The audio guides are very helpful by identifying some of the tombs, but you really need a detailed guidebook for background or for those not on the audio guide. Tudor fans should head for the Henry VII Lady Chapel to see the tombs of Elizabeth I and her sister \"Bloody Mary\" among others. The ceiling is fantastic. We enjoyed excellent scones and tea in the cafeteria near the Abbey Museum (which is also well-worth a visit.)If you want a decent seat to hear the choir sing Evensong, get on line outside the church by 2:30.

Once you pass inside you collect your audio set which friendly staff provide in various languages and then you can wander around following the guided instructions via the audio set. Even though the Abbey is busy the place and layout is so well organised you just follow the flow even though it was busy you do not feel jostled or hurried. The Abbey dates back to Edward the Confessor in the 10th century and is full of history with many famous monarchs and people buried there in the various chapels. The architecture is wonderful and breath taking as to the scope and magnificence. Once the tour is complete you can visit the caf\u00e9 and museum and don't forget a visit to the shop before leaving which is filled with a variety of goodies to buy."

Not only has this cathedral witnessed every coronation except two since the battle of Hastings in 1066, it is the final resting ground of many famous people. And many more who aren't actually buried here have a memorial stone dedicated to them. For example, I didn't know that Sir Isaac Newton or Anne of Cleves were buried here. The tombs of Queen Elizabeth I, Mary I, and Mary Queen of Scotts are most impressive, as is the tomb of Edward the Confessor. The only way to see the area where Edward the Confessor is buried is to take the guided tour. I highly recommend the guided tour because you will see all the highlights in a small group. The tour guide has a way of clearing crowded areas so you can step right up and see various memorials and tombs.Unfortunately you can't take photographs, but the cathedral gets quite crowded and lingering photographers would probably make the congestion worse. Don't be discouraged if you see a long line waiting to get in. The line moves quickly. When we arrived the line was all the way down the sidewalk to the street but it probably only took 10 minutes to get to the entrance."

It was so crowded it was almost impossible to appreciate the beauty. There were also ropes set up to control the flow of visitors. This helped to contribute to congestion points within the Abbey. It was also sad to see that the chapter house now has a carpet covering the original tile floor with a small portion of the tiles exposed near the center. It used to be you had to take off your shoes and put on special foot wear to enter the chapter house. I am sure the change was made for conservation reasons but it was disappointing none the less. If you have not seen the Abbey, go see it. Just be prepared for very large crowds. If you have been before they started charging admissions, rethink your visit. It will not be the same as before."

I'm neither a churchgoer nor a history enthusiast, but having attended Westminster Abbey twice I recommend that nobody miss it for the world.The building alone is a wondrous feat of majestic architecture, and what impresses outside serves to contain only greater treasures within. What makes the historical elements of the Abbey's luster so very captivating is how they materialise in the bones of British heroes and heroines lying so close to your fingertips as you traipse around the Abbey. You are brought into very really contact with some of the greatest figures of Britain's most prime and celebrated culturally identifying moments; Chaucer, Elizabeth I, Darwin, the Unknown Soldier... And until you are confronted with these figures in such immediacy as the Abbey offers, you've no idea just how capably moving they are. Aside from the figural history, the Abbey retains much charm as an operational place of Christian service - and this I say as a devout atheist. The church's appeal is simple in that it is raw; behind the veil of such awesome architecture is an admirably basic motivation: to continue a Christian tradition that has been conducted and evolved on this same site for countless centuries. And there is no better way to end one's visit to the Abbey than with tea and cakes at any number of the adorable cafes open around the site. Ask not what specific reasons there are for you to visit Westminster Abbey - ask what valid reasons you have to turn down the opportunity. Really, there can't be any."

But they do it so well. This is my 5th visit to the Abbey over the years and every time I go there I see something new. If I didn't have the 3 Day London Pass I doubt if I would have gone again because the queuing and the crowds do get a bit annoying. But I'm glad I did because the pass gets you to the head of the line and once you've been there before you have a better idea of what you want to see. Anybody who is anybody in British history is buried there and the architecture and the memories of coronations and weddings that have taken place even in my lifetime make it all the more interesting.

But who can forgo seeing Queen Victoria's actual tomb and other incredibly historical burial sites of royals and other notable like Jane Austen? There is a nice gift shop adjacent to the church for your souvenir needs once you leave. The entry tickets included an audio tour but we were fortunate enough to come upon one of the guides who works in the abbey and he really complemented what the audio tour might have left out. Again, buy your entry tickets before you \"cross the pond\" as it does help with the lines when you arrive. Of all the attractions we visited, including Windsor Castle, Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace, this by far was the most crowded.

A few suggestions follow:1. Arrive between 2:30 and 3:00 PM when entrance lines are shorter. The line can be frustrating as visitors are fumbling for cash and credit cards.2. The \"audio tour\" (free with admission) can be somewhat confusing and difficult to follow. Some \"stations\" on the audio tour are closer to each other than it would appear on the accompanying map.3. To fully enjoy the abbey, be sure to look up and down as well as straight ahead and side-to-side.4. Even though you have the audio tour, do not hesitate to ask questions of those who work there. They have stories and anecdotes that you won't find on the audio tour.5. Poet's Corner was a highlight for us! There you will see tombs and monuments to the people you learned about in school. Spend time there. Take out your smart phone and read summaries about people like Charles Dickens, Chuacer, Sir Laurence Olivier, John Masefield, and Alfred Lord Tennyson.6. My only criticisms are the traffic flow (which is inevitable in a site this important) and the audio tour (which could be a little more explicit in helping one to find the site being discussed).Go!!

Architecturally the place is amazing and then to think your walking where the first Royal wedding was in 1100 AD. They have mass there regularly and if you want to say confession you can meet with a priest and do it there. There is one downside the bathrooms provided to visitors are atrocious. I told my husband had this been a car stop on a road trip we would have gotten back in the car and gone on down the road. Filthy, smelly and cramped. So go to the Abbey, just go empty."

Although there seemed to be a number of staff wandering around nobody seemed to be doing anything.Eventually we got served but instead of dealing with orders immediately the waitress was busy doing other jobs so was not handing in the orders to be made up. Long Wait again. Coffees came but I think we must have been on rations as got short measure.When we went to pay, there was no one there to help us. We nearly felt like walking out.What a shock! They were adding a service charge on top of the already expensive coffee-What service?. The old set up in the cloisters was much better as they served lovely soup,coffee and muffins-reasonably priced."

The men and boys' choir offers a different sung high mass each week, and summers offer visiting choirs an opportunity to perform. Voices ring and echo off the high vaulted ceilings, and the organ peals away in performances that lure me into feeling I'm at a recital rather than a mass. The plummy tones of the clergy offer prayers and homilies granting either time for reflection or time to regard the splendid architecture. Sitting in poets' corner or statesman's corner is for visitors always a memorable experience, but after mass, the ushers will try to herd visitors out so the next service can begin. After mass, have a bite at the spacious modern cafe, and wonder what the monks might have dined on in ages past. Then visit the wonderful little museum, where Lord Nelson and William and Mary figures are dressed in their own clothes, and old vestments and memorabilia sit in glass cases. You can buy a CD or bookmark at the museum shop.Nearby is a small enclosed garden, but you just get to peer in from a gate."

Its not a comfortable seat but its pretty old & has had many a royal backsides on it from a long time esp when they were stiff & steady for Coronations.There is a poets corner & well known poets will be seen there interred, Chaucer I recollect was one. Chapels inside the Abbey is for the Monarchy.Even the current Regina _ Queen Elizabeth. Not to forget the weddings - most royal ones were held here - including Prince Willima with Katherine.Once you step out there is a huge courtyard - where you can click pics & enjoy a tea. Souvenir shop is not really great. Along with the ticket there will be a free something for the kids, which will entice you to visit the souvenir store & stand in along queue. You get a chocolate coin (thats what I got) for all your wait- but try telling that to your kids. So skip the souvenier shop if you can. Psst ! you will get it cheaper at Camden!!"

A very worth while purchase.The architecture in west minster abbey is breath taking and the audio guide was very informative although at some parts it seemed to go on a little too long for my liking and I felt that I was just standing around listening to it rambling on.A truly breathtaking experience and I would really recommend a visit here while in London, whether you are religious or not it is definitely an experience you don't want to miss.The only thing that disappointed me being a tourist was that there was no photography allowed inside Westminster abbey :( how can a tourist and avid photographer travel to london and look at brilliant sights and not be able to capture those memories. Perhaps a no flash photography policy would be better than no photographs at all. Just an idea!!"

There is a charge to visit the interior spaces and photography is not allowed. Pictures and other things may be purchased in the Abbey shop. Check the Abbey web site before going as the building may be closed for special services or other state occasions. The critically acclaimed Abbey choir of men and boys is not to be missed. There are many opportunities on Sundays during the choir term to attend a choral service. Evensong- a late afternoon choral service is sung almost every day. Again check the Abbey web site for times and dates. In summer these services may be sung by visiting choirs. My biggest criticism of Westminster Abbey is the less than friendly attitude of it's vergers and clergy. They are cold and unwelcoming treating visitors like school children or interlopers."

After all, you are in a Church, (and you can sit in for a service if you'd like). I went with my boyfriend and we both enjoyed it. I do think that children might be a little bored and might not understand the full capacity of what they are seeing.The entirety of Westminster Abbey is really large - the overall tour, listening to everything and fully taking everything in actually took almost two full hours. Inside the Church is hundreds upon hundred of memorials and tombs for the rich, famous and important people of England. From the Kings and Queens of England to Charles Darwin! It is amazing how much they've stored in there, and how beautiful it really is!I managed to get this tour in the morning, drop by the National Gallery and the Museum of Natural History in one day.

When tourists pay \u00a318 a head to go round, they're entitled to expect to be allowed to do what tourists do.) In contrast, one of the Volunteers, asked where a particular window was, kindly looked it up in his book and then conducted us there even though it was at the opposite end of the Abbey from where we were when we enquired. It is difficult to move around. Some of the aisles are quite narrow and people are lingering, listening to the commentary on their audio-guides, or - in groups - to their guides. Of course, too, many memorials are on slabs set into the floor so people back into you looking at them. One has to go once in one's life, I suppose, but it will cost and won't be easy."

It was overwhelming (in a good way) learning about all of the history, people married and buried at The Abbey. I understand it but wished that we could have taken photos inside, but I do understand and respect why they prefer no photos. After the tour inside, you are able to take photos on the back lawn that gives a full view shot of the church, it's pretty amazing! 100% worth going. Also, I bought the London Pass which gives you the Fast Track entry, so glad we had this since the normal line wrapped the building. The London Pass saved us so much money and waiting time!"

Headsets are included in the admission price and provide excellent detail on the history, tombs, and architecture. You can take your time wandering around.

There are restrooms near Poet\u2019s Corner and in the restaurant, but you\u2019ll need your ticket to exit and return.

The signage was a little confusing and the staff were quite snooty and unhelpful. The worst aspect was the toilets which were absolutely disgusting! Half of them were out of order and those that were working were filthy and had no toilet tissue. We found this to be quite unacceptable considering the entrance fee. We were embarrassed to be British as the majority of visitors were from overseas and were expressing their disgust quite vocally.

Then at noon we attended a mass in the Abbey and received Communion. The mass was almost identical to a Catholic Mass but this was the Church of England but very similar. After the audio tour was over as we left we walked by the museum and spent some time there and we also went into an art exhibit in a room of stained glass windows and one of the staff explained the stained glass to us which was fantastic because there were so many nuances we would have missed.

The ticket is definitely over priced. It should be around half the price. Then decided to go. After all, we had spent a lot in coming to London. It was an excellent piece of history which we saw, but more for the Britishers or those of the British descent for herein lie graves and memorials of past English monarchy and nobility. A smattering of graves of other luminaries like Oliver Cromwell and Charles Darwin including Lister can also be spotted. It was interesting to see the graves of Elizabeth I and Mary of Scots on opposite shrines. Lovely architecture. The statues and wall stained glass windows were a marvel. The wooden pews and central alter were beautifully carved. Quite marvelous. Regretfully, photography was not allowed. But, the free audio guide is a must. You must take it. The visit is worthless without it. Take it and walk by at a measured pace so that you can fully enjoy the experience.... expensive as it is.While we were there, the 12.30 mass was taking place. The topic of the day was the barbarism which was taking place in the middle east and there was a plea for harmony amongst the various sects and religions. All in all, a good educative visit."

Steeped in History, Royalty, Beauty, Architecture and presence you may have heard some of the stories of famous kings, English legends and the word-renowned buried within the Abbey itself. But it doesn't do justice to say one or two famous names and leave it at that.The list of influential persons buried under the floors, walls, and in the crypts here is a literal \"who's who\" of significant matters and English as well as other National Heritage. Each with stunning displays in varying beauty memorialized in marble inscriptions to classical and ornate statuary spanning the ages.Isaac Newton, Shakespeare, Churchill, to Queens and Kings of England's greatest and most trying times. Poets to playwrights the Abbey is an amazing treasure trove worth exploring and honoring.There is a fabulous audio tour (excellent and most appropriate English narrators, but I won't give the secret away) included with your ticket purchase which you must do: as listening to it explains the beauty and origins of the Abbey ( from humble monastery to it's gothic grandeur), it's ornate individual chapels to the entombment of famous and important dignitaries. The latter which will astound you as to how many persons are contained within the Abbey to this day.Don't forget to stop into the small museum area as well as the cloisters, and college gardens if you are lucky enough to visit on a day the gardens are open (I think M-W but check.)Well worth your time and definitely a must do when visiting London. There truly is no other place like it, and Westminster Abbey is rightly deserves to be called a historical wonder. "

It really added a lot to our visit - the stories behind the people are one of the things that make Westminster so interesting. It's right across the street and to the right from the Westminster underground stop.Westminster Abbey is very close (easy walking distance) to Big Ben, Churchill's War Rooms and St. James's Park - all are worth a visit. That makes this a great underground stop for a day but it is quite a crowded area, with loads of people stopping to take lots of photos.The lineup can be deceiving, it moves quickly. Also, it is not cheap to get in. About \u00a317 if I remember right. The crowd inside was quite subdued and respectful - there are a few of the side chapels that are quite claustrophobic but well worth the time to explore them. Watch out for raised bits on the floor as you enter some of the side chapels. You might not see them because you will be staring at the amazing ceilings! There are so many monuments and memorials in this cathedral that you really are tripping over them. There is a lot of gold, very ornate ceilings, and so much of interest. Poet's corner was really nice, with all the memorials to Shakespeare and lots of others. This is a magnificent cathedral and, unfortunately, you are not permitted to take photos inside.Don't miss the coronation chair at the end of the tour."

So when we got the London Pass Cards, it was my number one thing to visit. We got fast track entry and surprisingly we were given free audio guides. As soon as you walk into the Abbey, you feel like you have moved back in time. It is just a magnificent place. Everyone should visit and experience it for themselves. Every single corner of the building is full of history. Make sure you take an audio guide, otherwise you will have no clue what to look out for. Take your time and explore it fully. It is worth every penny you pay, but I would recommend getting the London Pass Cards as you go in for free and with fast track. The queues for normal entry are always very long and the adult ticket is around \u00a318.50"

It is a magnificent attraction, a major piece of British history beautifully preserved. The audio guide is superbly executed; it lets you walk through the chapels in your own pace. I am not a technical talent but it was very easy to navigate and also to select from the additional multimedia content. The English version is narrated by Jeremy Irons, the Hungarian version also uses well known voices from national TV which we found an advantage. The attendants are very helpful. It is difficult to understand why you are not allowed to take photos at all (not only the use of flash was prohibited)."

My husband and I were so excited at the thought of attending a worship service and free organ concert at Westminster Abbey on Sun Aug 17, while we were visiting London Aug 16-22. But surprisingly, it was not a good experience from the moment we were ushered in until the minute we left. No one was friendly or even polite. In fact, I understand that positively NO pictures are allowed inside the Abbey, but the workers were beyond MILITANT about it, constantly pacing back and forth, eyeing the crowd and barking \"NO cell phones!\" and \"NO photographs!\" at anyone remotely looking as if they were reaching for a cell phone or a camera throughout our visit! It was actually ridiculous and quite unpleasant. So, although the stone work inside the Abbey is beautiful in its own way and the church itself is of course an iconic masterpiece, steeped in history, the actions and attitude of the staff who work in the Abbey undermine and overwhelm any positive experience we could have otherwise had there during our visit. The organ concert was excellent and obviously, the organ itself was exquisite as the sound enveloped every corner of the interior space. But, other than that, we were left feeling exceptionally cold. Even the sermon message surprised me, as it was wholly secularized and politicized, having nothing to do with God. Although I did light a candle and pray for the Lord's peace on our world on my way out, this experience was not at all what I anticipated, considering it is a functioning church and therefore a house of God. It certainly wasn't warm or welcoming as one would reasonably think a house of God would be. But, considering its history, I suppose it's still worth a visit as a tourist attraction, and maybe paying the entrance fee and going during tourist hours is better than going when we did for the free organ concert and evening worship service on Sunday (with NO choir or communion, by the way). That said, if you are only going to visit one church in London, I'd strongly recommend skipping this one and going to St. Paul's Cathedral instead!! It's a far more warm and welcoming environment with friendly staff, both for tourists and worshipers alike!! No comparison!!"

Friendly Abbey staff on hand to greet you and to provide an audio guide (included in the price). Unless you are on a guided tour then this is a must as there is limited information around the cathedral. The audio guide is narrated by Jeremy Irons and provides a lot of information as you follow the route on the map. Even with the number of people visiting this is a fairly peaceful place. Take a seat near the nave / quire and take it all in. A real \u2018wow\u2019 moment and made me feel overcome with joy.

The Choral Evensong is an Anglican religious service conducted primarily by the officiant and the Abbey's (or a nearby Abbey's) choir, however, all are welcomed to attend. While I sat/stood and listened to the choir, I marveled at the history around me and it's awe inspiring for anyone with any interest in history.There is no fee associated with the religious service. Just line up along the West Gate (that's the gate in all the photos of the Abbey). When we went, ppl queued up at 4 pm, for the 5:00 p.m. service. Just be aware that you will not be able to roam around the Abbey. It's a religious gathering after all. Do go early though, and you may find yourself seated behind the choir, which is also quite a treat, considering you're probably using a bench previously occupied by some nobility.My wife and I attended with the understanding that we're participating in a tradition that's lasted several centuries, in one of the world's great religious sites. Besides, you'll probably recognize the Lord's Prayer, so your heresy is marginalized."

However, the whole experience was made disappointing by how rude the stewarding staff were, which is why I've downgraded the rating to Poor.On entering the Abbey, I pointed out the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to the teenager who was with us. The steward nearby said (in a very rude tone of voice) \"You can look at that later, you need to go and sit down\". Now I understand that they need to keep people moving, but he could have simply said \"Would you mind going to your seat, please - you'll have the opportunity to look at the tomb on your way out\" or similar, and the tone of his voice was, frankly, disgraceful. Further down, two other stewards were too busy chatting to each other to welcome people. Not one of the stewards welcomed us with a smile.So, all in all - the service was a lovely experience, but I think whoever has oversight of the staff needs to have words about customer service.

This is a review not so much of Westminster Abbey -- whose awe-inspiring importance as an ecclesiastical building can hardly be overstated -- as of what those responsible for its operation have reduced it to: one of London's most grasping and user-unfriendly tourist sites. A logical analogy might be made with St. Peter's in Rome, where - despite the pressure of even greater crowds -- entry is still free and staff more or less amiable. By contrast, the entrance fees (\u00a318) to Westminster Abbey are extortionate and many of the staff condescending and surly. It now operates like a living allegorical embodiment of the money changers in the Temple, although those responsible for its reduction to the crassest commercialism seem to have no recognition of the irony of what they have made of it. One would have thought that the senior churchmen responsible for its operations would have recognized that excluding on economic grounds much of the population of Britain, and employing staff many of whom are short-tempered, condescending and sometimes downright rude in their attempts to hurry through the building as quickly as possible patrons who have paid handsomely for the privilege of being there, are betrayals of the trust placed in them in their roles as guardians of what is arguably the most important and historic public building in England. The Dean and Chapter should be ashamed of having allowed things to come to this sorry pass. Much the same might be said of the similar surrender of St. Paul's Cathedral to economic opportunism."

The Abbey is worth a visit just to see the structure itself,but, if you wanting to see the inside you can go during services as the Abbey is still a working church. Just don't be a jerk and leave mid-service. The choir is lovely and if you are really lucky you can listen to the boys choir. If you are wanting to pay to go in...it is not a cheap venture,stuffed to the gils with people...go EARLY and avoid the long lines."

Took my kids for the first time, and it was a great history lesson for them. In the past I have gone to a service, which I highly recommend. It is always full of tourists, so if you don't go to a service, you are likely to NOT get a spiritual experience here. The audio tour is very good - I like listening to Jeremy Irons' voice.All of the tombs give you a great opportunity to share with kids what the people have contributed to science, literature, music, etc. Before London we were in Normandy, so my son liked seeing the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the Churchill memorial.When you leave the grounds, make sure to go across the street to Parliament Square and admire the statues.If you have small kids, be warned that the bathroom experience is not great."

I think the fee was cash only so make sure you have it on you after waiting in line.Once inside, go straight to the free audio guide. Then you can relax and listen to Jeremy Irons soothingly teach you about British history and the Abbey. The flexibility of being able to go to different areas and hit the corresponding number on the audio player was terrific when it was so crowded with tour groups as you could skip sections and come back rather than be forced to follow an order. Don't miss Poet's corner at the end. Truly amazing history.

The Abbey is a beautiful building and I loved the artitecture. The tomb of the unknown soldier is very moving. However there are so many people buried here that it felt like a grave yard. You walk over them and in all,of the side chapels someone or many paople have been buried so that the chapels are lost. I wondered as a christian why these people are buried inside the Abbey? Poets? Musicians? Historic military people? Why inside the Abbey? Old monarchs are also buried and they just added to the 'graveyard' feeling. It comes across as a celebration of he great and the good and powerful.,rather than a place of worship. If it was not for the tomb of the unlnown soldier I would say it is not a \"must-see\" in London.St Pauls is so much more impressive cathedral. Be prepared for crowds, walking in a one way system, using the audio guide - I did not find it held my attention. It did not feel like a palce of prayer."

Most people seemed to be so-and-so's brother's niece, but since all the inscriptions are in Latin or Old English so it takes a bit of decoding.

As we had already paid a rather high fee to see St. Paul's Cathedral, we decided to attend the 5:00 evening song so that we could see the famous abbey for free. You need to arrive a little before the service begin (or, if you get in early enough, you can sit in the choir section). You have to tell the guard that you are there for the services, and he will let you through without charge. I loved looking around at the beautiful architecture and enjoyed the lovely service. We were seated on hard chairs that are probably set up for service daily as they aren't permanent fixtures, and we were packed in tightly. It wasn't the most comfortable service ever, but it was easy to see and hear everything. I really would have loved to explore the abbey for hours, but I was really over paying ~$50 for my husband and I to tour London attractions.The only real complaint I have with the churches in England is their double standard. If you are going to charge a (rather high) fee for admittance, you really lose a little bit of your credibility of calling it a sacred ground and therefore banning photos. Profiting off a religious ground and not even allowing pictures is a little shady."

The architecture is absolutely stunning and it's simply amazing that this building has been standing for hundreds and hundreds of years. Even more impressive is the sheer number and importance of the people buried within its walls. To stand near the graves of Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton, Charles Dickens, and Geoffrey Chaucer was a feeling that I shall never ever forget. If you're in London for a short trip and are wondering which places you should see, Westminster Abbey should be your #1!"

This is one of the most important sights in the country and a place that is well worth including on your must-see list of attractions. This is the sight of English coronations, weddings and funerals processions for the monarchy for the past millennium. It is also the resting place of many important figures throughout British history, probably the most remarkable collection of tombs in the English speaking world. Entry price is a bit steep at (\u00a318.00 per adult and \u00a38.00 per child) but entry includes a very good audio guide, narrated by Jeremy Irons, that helps you identify important tombs and understand other things you are seeing. There is also a handheld brochure map that you can use to help navigate your way around the abbey and grounds. Do make sure you pick this up once inside. In addition to the many important tombs and other interesting things to see, the abbey itself is a gothic masterpiece, with a attractive nave, vaulted arches, stained glass windows and other classic gothic architecture that provides the perfect medieval feel for this attraction. While visiting, try to make time to also see St Margaret's Church in the courtyard, the Abbey Museum, lovely Chapel House and Cloister. There is also a Abbey Garden that you can visit, the Cellarium Cafe found in a 14th century store room and gift shop at Westminster Abbey as well. Altogether, you can easily spend 1.5 - 2.5 hours here if you use the audio guide visit the rest of the abbey grounds leisurely. Tip: A great way to visit Westminster is to arrive around 8.50 am in the morning, allowing you to hear Big Ben sound off at 9am. Then, you can make your way over to Westminster Abbey to queue for the opening at 9.30am.If you are in a group, one member can stand in the queue, while the rest of your party walk across the street to Parliament Square to see the statues of important historical figures found there or you can walk around the abbey to admire the Gothic architectural exterior of the abbey. Then it will be time to enter Westminster Abbey at 9.30am to begin your visit."

Many royal events have taken place here over the years. More recently, my friends (smile) Prince William and Kate the Duchess of Cambridge got married here. I visited here on my birthday, July 22nd which happens to also be little Prince George's birthday (their son) that he shares with me I might add (smile). As I walking toward the entrance, the bells were chiming loudly and it lasted for quite some time. I wonder if they were recognizing Little George's birthday oh and of course mine. I didn't have to wait long as I was using the London Pass which had a fast track entry. The inside was just breathtaking as well. So many famous people from history coming from all walks of life are buried here. I was walking in the footsteps of them and the royals who have visited there. The courtyard and gardens are also impressive. The greenery surrounds you and it is so serene in the midst of all of the visitors. As I was leaving, I heard angelic voices. It was the choir practicing upstairs. I stood there and just listened for a few moments taking it all in. I then recorded a few moments of it and got a little teary-eyed. It is a must see on so many levels! You must make it a part of your visit to London. If you are using the London Pass, your admission is included. If not, there is a fee and it is worth every penny. I highly recommend it to everyone reading this. Plan on spending about 2-3 hours there. You will walk away with a better understanding of all of the beauty and peace these cathedrals have to offer."

The periodic pause for commemoration and prayer by the Abbey minister reminds you that this is, after all, a church. Searching for, and finding, your favorite dead person is a treat and often surprising. Charles Darwin has one small likeness and a plain slab! And it's next to Isaac Newton's much grander memorial.The size of the place spreads the crowds out to a tolerable distribution.

Our verger had been present for the wedding of Will and Kate and the funerals of lady Di and the Queen Mum. He shared stories from events. I feel forever connected to the place now that I've sat in the quire and stood at the foot of the high altar where so many historical events have and will occur. The tour took us behind the high altar where Kate and Will signed their marriage certificate before exiting the church. The knights' chapel with all their colorful banners and coat of arms contrast with the deep dark wooden chairs and sky high ceilings carries you back in time. It's the resting place of many kings and queens, poets and writers, scientists and the who's who of centuries. Names like Sir Isaac Newton, Mary Queen of Scots, and Rudyard Kipling link this cathedral to the notables of history gone by. Walk through the towering arches and let this landmark take you back to the distant and not so distant past. Westminster Abbey is a must see!"

However, it is extremely crowded and over priced. I have been to cathedrals all over Europe and Westminster is pretty 'standard' in terms of architecture. I'm certain you can find just as amazing, if not more spectacular, quieter cathedrals throughout the country. If cathedral architecture is your thing, head out to smaller centres. If you want to learn about England's monarchy and see some historic tombs, go to Westminster. After visiting for the second time, I realized that its historic burials are really the main attraction (but most of the time you cannot get close enough to the actual tombs because of crowds). If you have the money and the time you shouldn't skip it altogether. However, if you are on a limited budget, do not worry about skipping this place to save a bit of cash."

We arrived about an hour and a half early and there was no line. We explored the area and had a great time taking pictures until a line started forming about 45 minutes before it was supposed to be open. Once the line began forming, we jumped in. The line was allowed to enter the gates and wait outside the door to that Abbey once the opening time arrived. We were however left waiting there for another 30 minutes before anyone was let in as there was a service going longer than had been planned. Be prepared for unexpected wait times!Tips:- Arrive at least an hour before opening and get in line. The line is actually around back, we had a hard time finding it.- There is no way to buy tickets ahead of time. You can however buy a London City Pass, and that will get you in here. - There was a separate line for those with a London City Pass. This line was much shorter. - The audio tour is great if you have the time, and budget, for it.- There are no pictures allowed inside. - I found that one of the buildings serves an afternoon tea, I did not get to partake in this, but I would love to the next time I go. - There is a store that can be accessed at any time and you don't have to tour the Abbey to go in. - I believe there were restrooms on site.In summation, this building is beautiful, full of history, and worth a stop. Make sure to get there early and plan in enough wiggle room for unexpected waits."

The original coronation chair that every King or Queen for last 800 years has been crowned in was a highlight as was the rest of the Royal history inside."

You can see tombs of people like Newton & Darwin. There's no personal guide, but they give you an iPhone with a preprogrammed tour, and this will lead you on your journey. You can even see the tomb of Queen Elizabeth and her rival Mary queen of Scots. At some point it gives you shivers in the back.

The Gothic architecture is breathtaking, it is like the Palace of Westminster, one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen. 1,000 years of history covering Royal Marriages, burials and Worship. Poets Corner - has burials from Chaucer, Tennyson through to Dickens. There is seating here to rest and absorb the atmosphere and read all the famous names. If you are a history buff you will be in your element. Go early - opening time - as the queues can be horrendous. I recommend the audio guides. It is a bit pricey for a family but worth it. It can be busy in the tomb area particularly near Edward the Confessor but we were ahead of the crowds and had no problem. It is dimly lit which adds to the reverence of the place but watch out for the occasional uneven flag stone and small steps. The beautiful vaulted ceiling, tiled floor, pews and heraldry let you know you are about to walk down one of the most famous aisles in the world - most recently walked by William & Kate & now us! There is just too much to mention - all positive. Beware - the coffee concessions are to be avoided as a real rip off - expensive - sneaky cups full of froth no coffee. They are a concession in the walkway/quad that rely on the fact that queues are too long to go back to complain. This negative is minor to what is a brilliant day out. You won't be disappointed. Very highly recommended."

The architecture can be compared to the great Gothic styles of Paris . The flying buttresses help to support the weight of the structure. The interior of the Abbey is equally impressive. Though I was surprised at the size. I thought the interior was much smaller than it looks on TV. I watched the weddings of both Princess Diana and Kate Middleton and the Abbey looked so much bigger on TV. The Abbey is quite beautiful inside. Many of the previous monarchs are buried at the Abbey as well as national heroes like Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. We enjoyed walking in the gardens and the museum was very interesting. We attended the Noon mass in the Abbey which was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the day."

I was taking photos and wondered why some people were refused entry and others were admitted. Standing near the Keeper of the Gate I discovered the password \"Evensong\" and what a world it revealed. Being seated in the body of the Abbey we heard the Abbey's Boys Choir in full voice which was amplified by the acoustics of this wonderful place of worship. In the service itself we witnessed the Church of England at it's very best. The following year we went again and as others were rejected we whispered the password and the Gatekeeper quietly said \"Certainly, you know where to go\". This time it was slightly different and we were seated at the back of the Choir Box immediately behind seven members of the Men's Choir an experience that still remains crystal clear in our minds. Fast forward to Friday 6 June just gone and we are back again at 4.45pm for the 5.00pm Evensong service. However, things have changed no password needed just join the 20 metre line but the experience is still the same, magnificent. If Evensong at Westminster Abbey doesn't bring you closer to God it will certainly make you ask questions of yourself and what you can do better. England and it's Church in all their glory."

Jeremy Irons narrated the English version that we used. The tour of the Abbey can be done at almost any pace.

It wrapped all the way around the corner, but it moved fast. Very fast. Was it expensive? Yep. The cost for adults was 18 pounds (around $33) and 8 pounds (about $14) for kids. Both fees were worth every penny. I was traveling with 19 teenage students, and I required them to see the inside of Westminister Abbey because it's seen the coronation of every British monarch since William the Conquerer! This is history!I can't recommend the audio tour enough. If I didn't have the audio tour, I would have had no clue what I was looking at. The audio tour is excellent. It takes you from the entrance and all the way through the abbey. It is informative and perfromed by Jeremy Irons, a.k.a. Scar from The Lion King. So, Scar will educate you all about almost a thousand years of the British Monarchy. Well, William the Conquerer was technically French, but in 1066 after the Norman Conquest of England, he was the monarch who changed England and the English language forever.As you meander through the abbey (it takes about an hour and a half), Scar will enlighten you about the tomb of Elizabeth I, her sister Mary, and loads of other members of the who's who of British Monarchy interred at the abbey. Again, Queen Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, the greatest monarch who ever lived, is entombed in this abbey. Queen Elizabeth I, who defeated the Spanish Armada! And if the Renaissance isn't your bag, Elizabeth II was coronated here, as was her father George VI, AND Prince William and Kate Middleton were married here!And Poet's Corner? Fantastic. It was everything I thought it would be and more. You'll recognize the names of dozens of authors who are either buried here or have monuments dedicated to their memories. Brilliant! The audio guide will provide you with details about the most notable tombs, and since it's the end of the tour, you can take a walk around and enjoy the waft of literary history for the remainder of your visit.There's a lovely gift shop at the exit, and if you look closely, you can check out St. Margaret's Church which is on the property, but you might miss it if you aren't looking for it.So from the first tomb of Charles Darwin, to the lovely gardens at the end of the tour, this is a \"must see\" in London. Don't be afraid of the crowds or the pricey entrance fee. You're in London to see the most important attractions. The student tour we were on did not include this on the itinerary, so we ditched the tour and went on our own. I would do it again because this is one of the most important attractions in London for all visitors to experience."

So prepare for distracted tourists bumping into each other or standing on you (you'll do it too!) My only negatives are that it assumes a great deal of English history awareness already... And without that it was about a lot of very old names flung together without much context. If I hadn't seen The Tudors & Reign on the tv, my GCSE in History wasn't enough - and it pains me that such dramatisations were of vital use!I would also have liked to see more about the recent royal wedding. A sense of the occasion - as to be honest - that's my only awareness if Westminster, and would have given me more of a connection. Maybe walk us down the aisle with Kate and Will and explain what they'd have seen or what little, in fact, those in the service might have seen but how it would have felt. Overall considering I was reluctant to do anything so religious - I was pleasantly surprised, though the price still felt quite steep."

This really is an incredible building - there is so much to see and so much history, you feel as though you are in another century!Take time when you visit Westminster Abbey - and if you can time it to hear the organ practice then you will treat yourself to another great delight! During the week is better, and if possible not during school holidays - but if that's the only time you can get there then bite the bullet and face the crowds, it's definitely worth it!"

It appears having a London Pass can save you a few minutes with it\u2019s own designated entrance. We spent three hours in total taking the audio tour, then down to the museum and down the corridor to explore the outdoor gardens past the abbey. Judging by the lack of visitors outside, this space is often missed by visitors, because it isn\u2019t well marked. Follow the corridor past the museum/store and around the corner to the left. Great views of the Parliament towers and Union Jack can be seen along with the charming gardens of its residents. This is a must do for history buffs as you imagine if these walls could talk."

From the elaborate crypts of the numerous bygone monarchs, to the place where current royalty are crowned and married, it's just too important to bypass. The architecture and interior adornment alone would be worth it without the rich history. But my favorite feature was the Battle Of Britain Memorial stained glass window in the Royal Air Force Chapel in the rear of the interior. The stained glass window, by Hugh Easton, contains the badges of the fighter squadrons that took part in the Battle.In four panels are shown visions which symbolise the Redemption. In one a squadron leader kneels before the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child. Below this she is represented in her sorrow with the dead Christ across her knees (a symbol of the sacrifice of the mothers and widows of those who died in the conflict). On the opposite side a panel shows a sergeant pilot kneeling before the Cruficifixion (a symbol of the sacrifice of the pilot himself). Lastly, above this, is the Resurrection seen by a pilot officer (representing the pilots' triumph). Seraphim, with six wings and with hands outstretched to paradise, are shown in the top row of the window. In the central section are the Royal Arms, the badge of the Fleet Air Arm and the badge and motto of the RAF \"Per Ardua ad Astra\" (Through struggle to the Stars). Extremely moving."

And there was William Pitt, the Older and the Younger. The Ladies Chapel....oh gosh, Queen Elizabeth I lays on top of her sister Queen Mary. The monument to the Royal Air Force was wonderful...\"we band of brothers\". Sir Laurence Olivier's monument lays right below the statue of William Shakespeare. Atlee, Allenby, Austen, Bonhoeffer, Booth and John Bunyan....and on it goes. Personal hand held tour that you carry with you and punch in the number for the narration....with the price of admission. And every hour visitors are asked to stop what they are doing an pray for a minute or two....lest we forget that this is a church. Very inspiring to me. Oliver Cromwell, Sir Francis Drake and Samuel Johnson...I would recommend some time on You Tube researching British history. Movies like Elizabeth I with Kate Blanchett, and Amazing Grace with Ioan Gruffurd and Benedict Cumberpatch are a good start.We couldn't do all that we wanted to do, it was impossible in the short time we were there, but I am so glad that I made this a priority."

I think this attraction is suited to either Christians who wish to join the mass at such an iconic abbey, or to those who are interested in the general and specific history that surrounds it. All in all, if it was not through the pass I would have been rather angry at the price that I would have had to pay for it. And that, I suppose, says it all."

Lots of former monarchy are buried in the Abbey as well as many famous poets, musicians, etc. from Handel to Shakespeare. Definitely do the audio tour so you can have a little more context of what you are seeing. It is worth the trip. Allow yourself some time as there is a good bit to see."

There was an audio self guided tour available, but I just walked through on my own. While on one hand I am happy to support the abbey, the price seemed a little steep to just walk through, and a freewill offering with a suggested amount would have been more palatable. In general, if you are going to go inside, dedicate some time so you can see everything and get your money's worth. If you just want to look inside, and see the coronation throne on the way in, save the money and go for a worship service. Also, photography in the abbey is prohibited, shutterbugs be forewarned."

As a Sixteenth Century historian specializing in the Tudors, I am extremely biased about this wonderful building. I first visited this site in 1975 and together with the Tower it inspired me to become an historian. In 2009, I returned to the Abbey for the first time since then. When I first entered such hallowed ground, I broke down in tears of joy and of reverence. It's a relatively small space but packed with great sites that tell the history of this great country. I always head for Elizabeth 1's tomb. As David T said in an earlier review, take your time and just breath it in. Forget those audio guides -- they detract more than add to your experience. Last year during my visit with Elizabeth 1, I stepped back to observe the other visitors. A young man was so glued to his audio guide that he quickly walked past her tomb without ever looking at it. What an incredibly sad waste of time and effort! Walk slowly into each room and carefully read the inscriptions on the tombs. They reveal much about the Medieval/Renaissance attitude toward life and death, our place in the universe and man's relationship with God. Also take time to study the magnificent funereal art and what it reveals about the inhabitants. If you can, attend one of the prayer services for Edward the Confessor. For one thing, it's the only way to see the tomb and also it's a lovely experience which only takes about 5 minutes, but 5 minutes well spent. Also, as David said, make sure you look down at the floor or you'll miss something quiet wonderful, such as the tombs of King Edward VI, Henry VII\"s son, who is buried in front of his grandfather's extremely lavish tomb, and also Barbara Villiers, Charles II's favorite mistress. Once you've finished your tour, walk out into the cloister area. There's a small museum there which is worth a few minutes. I noticed last year that they replaced the lovely little eatery with a higher priced restaurant. I'm not sure it's the worth the extra money, but I'll let you all be the judge of that. You must also visit the site dedicated to the Unknown Soldier from WWII. It is quite moving in its simplicity. Once outside, definitely take in the garden in back. It's a lovely place to sit and reflect on your experience which I'm sure you'll enjoy. Also, you can see Parliament looming up before you, yet another grand site. I have always been somewhat disappointed in the gift shop which acceptable for post cards and music recordings, but that's about it. The book selection isn't nearly at good as at the Tower. That said, the Abbey is one of the great sites well worth visiting numerous times. I can't wait for my next visit in late August. Maybe I'll run into some of you there."

We were in the Abbey for 2 or 3 hours... there are so many chapels and so much to see. At the end you can see the Coronation Chair which is in a secure spot as it is an important antique. It goes back many centuries yet is still used when a new British monarch is crowned. The only downside is that this is a very popular attraction and very crowded in June."

I took the tour this morning and was thoroughly impressed with Mr. Mott. A quick Google search indicates at least 4 other reviews mentioning him by name. Extremely knowledgeable -- there are approx 3500 people buried on the Abbey's grounds, many beneath the floor of the building itself, and I'd guess he knows all of them. The oldest part of the grounds date from the 11th century, although most of the Abbey itself is from the 14th. Not just royals buried there either, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Chaucer, and David Livingstone being amongst the riff-raff. Of note, if you have access to video of Kate and William's wedding, Mr. Mott can be seen escorting Princes William and Harry from the Chapel that was used as their holding room."

It's THE consummately British affair and the home of democracy with excellent tearooms that hark back to Edwardian grandeur.

The architecture and beauty of the building is really incredible. Not to mention the beautiful tombstones and Graves including that of Henry 11 Winston Churchill and believe it or not Charles Darwin. It is a beautiful as the store place in the little side attractions like the monuments to the Saints and the nights Templars are really something you to see at least once-in-a-lifetime. Plus you can light a candle to your favorite saint etc. We also really enjoy the cool and interesting gift shop. It is very centrally located near Parliament big Ben etc. and be a great port of a walking tour in that part of London. The headsets provided adequate historical background and knowledge of the building in my opinion. We did not take the stairways up for the scenic views. Let me also Holly recommend the little food court that was right outside of the exit of the building. We all got hot dogs and waffles with ice cream etc. there and everything we had to eat was great and actually reasonable. I don't remember the cost of this cause it was portable London pass and I believe that we actually had a quick entrance to this using the pass. In any event the lines were not bad at all here. We spent about an hour and a half to two hours which seemed adequate for this attraction although you could easily spend the whole day in this beautiful building. But with teenagers an hour and a half was plenty. It is not as cool as the Tower of London but the matter what it says on here I would rate it is one of the top attractions in the city. "

One thing I missed on my first visit to the Abbey in 1998 but I did not miss this time was the Stone of Scone. It is located in the back of the Abbey and it is a MUST that you learn it's history and what happened with it at the time of Queen Elizabeth's coronation.Unfortunately photography is not allowed in the Abbey so do purchase one of the nice books that describes the history of the Abbey and provides great pictures of important tombs of interest. You may also light a prayer candle and ask for a prayer intention. The prayer intentions are picked up every few hours and the intentions are prayed for by the Abbey's priests."

When I was last here there was no entrance fee so I wondered whether a visit would be worthwhile for small children (for whom there's no charge). It was! While it no longer offers brass rubbings for them, it has created a unique workbook for children which sets up a kind of treasure hunt, asking them to complete questions about the people honored there, about the number of lions and other animals they're able to identify, and about the various monarchs enshrined in the various chapels and gravestones. For example, one of the questions asked was what happened to Oliver Cromwell, which they will learn from the free audiphone tours provided (Cromwell was buried there but later removed by Charles II, beheaded posthumously and left in the streets to rot). My children loved the exercise and they were rewarded with a large chocolate coin in the gift shop at the end of our visit. They especially enjoyed Poet's Corner, seeing the graves of Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll and other authors they already appreciate. A high point for them was an informal tea in the Abbey's cafe, with light sandwiches, cakes, cookies and hot chocolate! They were not bored for a second and we were there for almost three hours. They actually enjoyed this experience more than the London Eye and the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace. So for short stays with children in London make sure Westminster Abbey is high on your list."

Each is full of interesting information sp as an adult it's well worth taking the time to listen. Could I suggest a children's audio like an abridged version. Despite this we enjoyed the experience greatly. Literally everyone who is anyone is buried here...the queen Mother to Dylan Thomas. The leaflet provided gives details of key past events and info regarding services which all are welcome. The only downside are the toilets. These are situated on an outbuilding round the back. They are unisex and few were open. I would buy a coffee at tge cafe to use their toilets. But all in all a good destination"

As this card is giving you free access to many attractions, including Westminster Abbey, we took this chance to visit it. So, my first advice, before to enter and if you have good weather, make outdoor photos of Westminster Abbey immediately !!! Because weather conditions in London are changing so fast that you can have sun when entering and rain when going out... You can get an audio guide in your mother tongue, but expect many people all around you watching and standing at the same place as you during all your visit ! I did not use it and I think it was much better, as I could move where I wanted and when I wanted, because not everything that you will see will interest you for sure...We took some photos outside but it was not authorized inside. Generally speaking, we saw it once, but no chance that we want to see it again ! It was more than enough with one visit. Mostly you will see tombs and a lot of sculpture with written things about people you have hardly even heard about, sorry but it was not that interesting to my eyes...Well, good luck if you want to visit this place and enjoy your day there ;-)I will soon post some photos, as seen from outdoor only.otterboris"

Sadly, based on the talk by the tour guide, Westminster seems more about being a tomb with the graves of many famous people as well an edifice to glorify the monarchy. You could quickly lose sight of the fact that it is a church. With all the tombs, the nave is very cluttered and, frankly, takes away from the majesty of the building. That being said, the building is so rich with history and is indeed impressive architecturally that it is a must see in London."

Bear in mind however that they do NOT allow photographs inside the Church. The fee for an adult admission is \u00a318.00, but my wife and I bypassed the line using the London Pass (which is totally worth the money for all the attractions it's good for). We visited at the right time because the Abbey was due to close for the following 2 days of our trip for a Royal ceremony. So, just a head's up, be sure to check that the Abbey is open for the public as it can close for private events at any time and DO check the hours of operation because certain areas and exhibits close at different times. The cloisters, college garden, and St. Margaret's church are free to visit, but do not grant entry to the main Church.The architecture was stunning and the craftsmanship on the many tombs was fascinating. Many historical figures from great writers to Royalty are buried there and others have memorials there. In the first hall there is a place where you can write down and leave a prayer or light a candle for a loved one. I lit a candle in memory of my late mother. I would have left a prayer, but the pencils provided were broken. The Abbey provided a free audio tour handheld device narrated by Jeremy Irons, but was also available in several other languages if necessary. It can get crowded, so be prepared to exercise a little patience while maneuvering through the different rooms and halls. There are members of staff on hand to answer questions and give historical information as well.So, if you are touring London, be sure to see this spectacular piece of history, but just be sure to check in advance that it's open to the public the day you visit or you could be sorely disappointed. I heard many, many people throughout my trip talking in passing about \"going to the Abbey tomorrow\", but we had to tell them it was closed for a few days for a private event."

Not as grand as many cathedrals but many interesting nooks and crannies and the history -- all the coronations since William the Conquerer have taken place here -- was marvelous.

The grandeur of the architecture and the history contained within the abbey are overwhelming to experience. My understanding is that you cannot purchase tickets in advance. I had purchased tickets for all other major attractions online but could not do so for the abbey. (There was a fast track queue for those who had a London Pass.) My husband and I arrived about 30 minutes before opening, and there was already quite a line.Because the experience is so overwhelming, I would suggest doing research before going, so that you know in advance what to expect. You can go to the Westminster Abbey website and actually download the audio tour (narrated by Jeremy Irons). I listened to the tour 2 or 3 times before going, and I was still overwhelmed and missed things. You will be so busy gawking, listening to the tour and trying to keep on track, and being pushed along by the crowds that you will miss a lot. I wish that I had purchased the official guidebook at the gift shop (about 5 pounds) a day or two in advance of my tour, so that I could have further prepared myself for the tour. For the money, the guidebook is a great souvenir (especially since you can't take pictures anywhere in the abbey).I went back a few days later to attend a 5:00 Evensong service. The service is free, of course, and if you get there early, you might be lucky enough to sit in the quire. I was seated right across the aisle from the choir. The service was moving and so beautiful."

We happened to go on an extremely crowded day, as the Abbey was closed for a church ceremony until 1:30. I recommend you check its schedule/website before visiting. Despite the crowds, it was a delightful visit thanks to a decent audioguide (included with admission) and a millennia of history to peruse. Poet's Corner was a highlight of the visit. The cloister was a lovely & restful outdoor space to be enjoyed, as well."

That's what I would recommend- figuring out when they will have a service or organ recital so you can go and enjoy the church, the organs, the preachers, and the people. Plus attending a service is free so you can leave a small donation for the church without paying exhorbitant entrance fees as the tour groups do. A beautiful interior with an amazing history-- if you opt out of the tour be sure to have a guide book and read up on the abbey before your visit so you can fully enjoy the interior. Know that if you attend a service you will walk through the cathedral to get to the service area but will not have access to every statue, every nook and cranny so if you have the time to stand in line for hours and the money to spend on the tour it may be worth it to pay for a visit if you are interested in seeing a particular person buried in the church or exploring its entirety.No photos allowed of the interior- whether you pay for a tour or not."

No pictures are allowed inside, so keep that in mind. The history in this place is AMAZING! Tons of people I've never heard of are buried here, but they must have been important to have a place among so many people I did know about. We didn't take the audio tour because we wanted to have conversations among ourselves, however, our conversations were all questions about who people were. Therefore, get the audio tour and I imagine you'll leave there with an even greater knowledge of why it is such an amazing place. Lastly, you're going to be walking on people's grave sites, but apparently they wanted it that way so don't feel too weird about it. It's the Cathedral's own fault for making you feel weird. And now the last point for reals, don't miss out on the King and Queen's that are buried here. Amazing costs went in to their place in the Cathedral. One other tip, it's still a church and you can wait in line to attend a service there, free of charge. Enjoy your trip!"

It stands as a symbol of Henry VII and his incredible influences on the country and the church. The history of Westminster Abbey is extensive. I could take an entire class dedicated to this subject alone. The church was built and added onto for years. The history of the architecture is important to the abbey\u2019s creation.The abbey was built in the middle of the English Gothic era. Some say it is a perfect example of this era. The English Gothic area lasted over 400 years. Westminster Abbey continuously grew and changed during this time. Westminster Abbey is one of England\u2019s largest examples of English Gothic architecture. Henry III started building the Abbey in 1245. He was especially fond of Saint Edward the Confessor and built the Abbey as a shrine to him.Westminster Abbey\u2019s largest distinguishing feature as English gothic is the pointed arches. This is a key gothic feature. The elaborate details in the arches is another important detail. The abbey is extremely detailed and elaborate. Additionally, the Abbey has many lancet windows, which are thin, narrow windows that line the Abbey\u2019s nave. The nave is the main area or middle of the church.Overall, Westminster Abbey is this massive church that not only illustrates the English Gothic architecture era of its time, but the influence of the church in England."

When we got in line, the sign said 30 minutes, but it was way less than 30 minutes. Make sure you take your time walking through it and find all the amazing tombs. It's a bit surreal! The Abbey wasn't crowded when we were there so we had no problem walking around at our own pace. However, I can see how a large crowd would make it very difficult to walk around and fully take all the sites. If you're going during high season, I highly suggest that you go early to avoid the crowds. The site is truly fabulous and definitely worth a trip and the ticket price."

But at 18 pounds (with a modest discount for students ... and this is the only place where they asked for (and carefully scrutinized) proof of student status for my student-daughter) it's horribly overpriced. While many other costly sites at least offer 2 for 1 admissions, this one does not, making it, by far, the most expensive site on our itinerary. We visited several other churches and cathedrals, and I was more than happy to drop a few pounds into the donation box, but this place is just extortionate.Once inside, the included audioguide offers some basic historical information on some of the chapels and monuments, but if it's not on the audioguide, there is no information at all to tell you what you are looking at or who the people are under all those grave stones or in those tombs. For that, apparently you have to go to the gift shop and buy a guidebook... (And once you've exited to the gift shop, I'm not sure you can get back in.)"

There were easily 5000 people touring when we were there. So at some points you are shoulder to shoulder as you try and view the many artifacts this huge church has to offer. We found the audio guide devices quite useful but several of the check point numbers were missing around the church so it created a lack of coherence and flow as you attempted to tour. Found the volunteers in green robes to be helpful and charming. There is a maddening no photography policy although pretty well everyone was ignoring this rule. Guess they're not making enough on the admission charged so they need you to buy the photo booklets as well and not have you take your own pictures. The sense of history remains powerful but if you are looking for a spiritual experience you can pretty forget it here as there are just too many visitors. All in all though it remains something the visitor to London still must see."

Westminster is in our top 3 or so because of the amazing collection of people interred there, and not just the usual kings and queens. Poets corner is a fantastic place to pause and reflect on the great writers and poets who have gone before. Indeed, add in Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton, the Unamed Soldier, Handel, Mary Queen of Scots, Edward the Confessor, etc, etc, etc then you get the idea. They all seem to speak to you as you stroll around. It is good they provide an audio guide as part of the entrance fee because otherwise it is steep frankly. The magnificent gothic ceilings in some of the chapels and main areas are breathtaking. Because of its popularity it gets crowded which spoils it a bit and it is not a cavernous space like the Cathederal at Sevilla, Spain where you can escape and draw solace. Nevertheless it is an amazing old Abbey that is a must see if you are a history buff. Make sure you check opening times though to avoid disappointment, and wonder around the adjacent Deans Yard to see how the other half live! Guys, you really should allow respectful photography inside, that is a but mean by other comparisons."

You might want to stay after the tour to see things that were missed, as the tour can't possibly cover everything there is to know."

Westminster Abbey was closing early on the day that I visited so I nearly decided that it was not worth paying the entrance fee since I would have less than an hour. I am so glad that I changed my mind and went inside. It was amazing! I used one of the audio guides that was provided for free and while I was rushed the guide was very informative. Next time I will allow time for one of the guided tours."

I was heart broken to see people shuffle through the church, stumbling over crypts, names, history, people without thinking twice about who these individuals were right under their feet. It really bothered me to see the names, dates and text worn off the crypts due to the foot traffic through the church. I was bothered by this. It seemed really disrespectful to me and made me want to know more about the history of each tomb. In the bookstore I found several books that gave insight on the individuals & made me realize that the church has hundreds if not thousands of years of records - so the information that may appear to be \"lost\" may have visually been removed but it has not disappeared forever. I hope the church improves the exhibit and how the visitors flow through the church. There has to be a better way to respect the sites and preserve the scripts on the tombs."

It is located in the City of Westminster, whole region that occupies the area, leaning on the left coast of river Thames between the Lambeth Bridge on the south and Westminster Bridge on the north.To the east from this gorgeous gothic building is the Palace of Westminster or Parliament Building which outlines in the dawn or in the dusk, we had seen so many times in old britain or holywood movies.This church was the traditional place of the coronation and the burial of England and later British monarchs. If we look back in the past, we can say that coronations started from the 1066 year, since William the Conqueror, the old Norman ruler.I entered naturally inside the Abbey, and remained stupefied for quite a time, perceiving the magnificent nave of the church, the King Edward's Chair, a very nice early middle age paintings, a recumbent effigy or likeness lying in repose, the cloisters and garth, the great number of inscriptions on the walls of the halls and on the monuments.That was the genuine top of the cake of my sojourn in London."

I first attempted to visit the Abbey on a Saturday afternoon---the line was around the block!!! I was devastated, as this was my only chance to see it because we had other things planned for the rest of my short stay. I decided I would wake up super early the morning I was leaving and be first on line. Visiting hours start at 9:30....I arrived at 8:30 and there was nobody there. I decided to take a walk to Starbucks to grab a coffee and muffin, and when I came back, there were 3 people in line. YAY! The doors opened right at 9:30 and after paying an 18 lb. fee, you were led into the Abbey and given a little electronic tour guide that looked like a phone. Wherever there was a sign with headphones, you'd input the number on that sign and it would give you a whole background on that particular area. Amazing. The Abbey itself...though it is quite large, it looks much smaller than what it looks like on TV. Especially the organ screen and the choir area. So much smaller and intimate. And it is so much more than just the church you see on TV. The tour will take you about an hour. Behind the alter are a bunch of different chapels and tombs...including Elizabeth I and King James and Shakespere. The architecture and detail of these chapels and tombs are absolutely breathtaking and quite moving. Also Note: No photography. I'm usually one to sneak a pic on my phone anyhow..but I just felt so disrespectful and wrong doing so....and NOBODY was taking pics...plus they have people watching you. In the Abbey shop they sell lots of pictures and post cards of the inside of the Abbey, so I bought some to remember some of the architecture. There are also the cloisters to visit and gardens which were also beautiful. At the end of your abbey tour, by the front glass doors, there is the coronation chair which I was excited to see. Also the tomb of the unknown soldier, surrounded by poppies...just so moving. If there's one place to see in London while you are there...arrive early to the Abbey and take a tour....you will not regret it!!"

The church is a Gothic gem, but it's the history associated with it that really glued us to the place for well over an hour. It's the burial place of most of the kings and queens of England, and so many musicians, actors and writers are either buried there or have memorial plaques. This is a walk around the best of England's royal and cultural history...from Edward the Confessor to Charles Dickens, Geoffrey Chaucer, Handel, various prime ministers, many of the nobility...please don't miss this! Tip: if you go on Wednesday, the abbey is open till 6.30pm, other days it closes at 3.30pm."

I've been a fan of England's royal history ever since I first read about Henry VIII as a nine year-old and visiting places like Westminster Abbey have been my dream ever since then. I finally got to visit the place about a week ago. I arrived an hour before it opened and simply seeing its magnificent edifice before me as I walked up the street was enough to inspire awe within me. I would strongly suggest going here early so you can take photos and still be at the front of the line since the queues rapidly from about a few minutes prior to opening time. The entrance fee of GBP18 might be a bit steep, considering that most museums and galleries in London offer free admission, but since this goes towards the upkeep of such a hallowed place, I didn't mind in the slightest.The Abbey was founded in 960 and is well over a thousand years old, and this hits you the moment you set foot within its walls. Countless monarchs have been crowned here ever since William the Conqueror's own coronation after The Conquest, and about seventeen of them are buried here too. I could have wept with reverence when I was before the tombs of Elizabeth I (my favorite monarch), Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, Margaret Beaufort, Anne Neville, Henry VII, and Elizabeth of York as I have been reading about them for most of my life and standing before their graves is the closest that one will ever get to actually meeting them. Bear in mind that you can't take photographs inside the Abbey, but I surmise that this was a mercy since you are forced to truly focus on the astounding sights that are before you. Many other dignitaries are buried here as well, such as Isaac Newton and the great Laurence Olivier, with memorials set up for literary luminaries like Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, and William Shakespeare, of course. Finally, no visit is complete without stopping before The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, a memorial to the numerous and nameless soldiers who fought and died for God, King, and Country during the War.One last tip: If I'm not mistaken, somewhere in Poets' Corner is a niche in the wall, which opens up into a small chapel/prayer room. I was able to spend a few quite minutes there in silent prayer and thanksgiving and I don't recall the last time I felt such profound peace within my soul in that little space.I heard the Abbey Choir's Evensong is also quite an experience, so I will endeavor to witness that on my next trip to London."

I could tell they were setting up for service so I asked if we were allowed to stay. The wonderful gentleman said the best place to wait is here inside, because once you go outside you have to wait in the general line outside. So we waiting for well over an hour before we were let in. To our surprise, the families of the boys choir were escorted in first to take their seats behind the boys (in the beautiful red velvet chairs you have all seen the dignitaries sitting in on the TV).....well, there were 4 seats left open in that area so WE GOT TO SIT THERE!!!!! the moment they started to sing I was overcome with emotion. I sobbed a majority of the time. It was truly a once in a lifetime experience and in my top 3 best days of my life!"

It was founded in 960 and the Coronations of a myriad of Monarchs happened here. Oh if the walls could talk! :-) It is a treasure trove of memorable sights. Literally hundreds of monuments and memorials. Seventeen Monarchs have their resting place here. It is also, with all of this, simply a beautiful, breath-taking place. Westminster Abbey is a working, usable church and holds 28 services a week. All are welcomed to these and the widely renowned choir are amazing...Parts of the interior are dim so if you have limited sight, that may be significant.

It was great to pay respects to those who have changed the course of our history, from Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Henry VII, Elizabeth I and Mary I and Edward the Confessor. The tours are a great way to see the Abbey as you don't get lost and double back or miss important sites and it's great to be a part of a larger pack, as you don't get shunted around so much by the amount of tourists they cram in there. One thing that really got me annoyed though, was the amount of tourists taking photos. It may just be my belief that you don't disrespect the dead, but I thought people cramming into the enclaves to take photos of the tombs was wrong- Westminster Abbey has signs posted telling people not to take photos but it seems most don't listen (it was the same in Notre Dame in Paris when we visited a week later). But that is personal opinion only. Overall the experience was awe inspiring and a fantastic way to start our history day in London."

Nevertheless we were inside within 25 minutes so not too bad - & well worth the wait & price of admission.The Abbey dates back over a thousand years & is an architectural triumph which you can't fail to be impressed by. Tombs of Queen Elizabeth 1st & Queen Mary to name but a few. Name plaques to honour all manner of well known & not so well known & some fascinating funeral effigies in the basement. There's also the famous Coronation Chair which has been used for all coronations since the 13th century (I think!). A visit to the Abbey is to walk the path of the great & mighty.Lunch a tad expensive but, hey, this is Westminster Abey after all & the food & service were excellent.There's also free entry to the adjoining St Margarets Church - where Winson Churchill was married - which is also well worth a visit.Of course you can also take in the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben & Westminster Bridge all of which are only seconds away & all of which are mightily impressive"

This is reflected in the price of admission, which was 18 L per adult, or 36 L for family of two adults and one child. Many other attractions in London have free admission. Self administered audio guides are provided for a circuit around the Abbey to view all the highlights. Going early at the opening hour of 930 am gives one a hint at how popular and potentially crowded the Abbey can get. London Pass holders can gain access without waiting in the queue which can be quite lengthy as the day wears on. The many venues within the Abbey are interesting but not compelling. Finding the various names of the many well known individuals buried here was not easy. Photographs are NOT allowed within the Abbey. The incredible range of nobles and historical figures over the past 900 years is impressive but a little monotonous. Historical information on the many individuals on site is not readily available which takes away from the informative potential of any visit. The structure, grounds, and monuments are certainly unique and worthwhile to study in person. However, I came away underwhelmed by the experience."

We opted to use the audio guides included in the ticket price - you receive a map with the audio guide that shows you what numbers to enter for each area. We probably spent a little over an hour following the map/audio guide.There is so much history! The guide points out notable tombs for numerous kings/queens/important people. There are tombs which are hundreds of years old - I think King Edward the 1st was the oldest we saw. Sometimes you do have to look around a little to figure out what the guide is talking about, but we didn't have too much trouble. I found Poet's Corner especially interesting because the average person can recognize many of the names.You can get close enough to touch nearly all the tombs, but that doesn't mean you should. We were saddened to see where people had scratched words into some of the stonework, these are tombs people!. Note that some of the Viking \"graffiti\" around the abbey, so be on the lookout for that. Another pet peeve of mine was people standing in small walkways, keep walking until there's space to stand and stare without stopping everyone behind you."

I can't imagine visiting this place without a tour guide. The abbey is massive, and there's so much to cover in such a short period of time. It was originally built as a monastery by St. Edward The Confessor and was later rebuilt in the Gothic style by King Henry III. The abbey that we see today is so much more than a place of worship. It's also the place for Royal coronations, weddings, and burials. As you walk though the abbey, you'll see memorials and burial sites of famous monarchs, poets, scientists, musicians, prime ministers, and actors. The Poets' Corner in the south transept of the abbey has names such as Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Robert Browning, Charles Dickens, George Frideric Handel, and Sir Laurence Olivier. You'll see beautiful architecture all around you from the cloisters to the cathedral. You don't have to be religious to enjoy it. It's worth a visit for it's historic and symbolic value. My only regret is not being able to spend more time here. Don't miss this experience."

It is expensive and, while I do not object in any way to paying to enter any church merely to look and admire rather than worship, I do resent paying \"top dollar\" and then have to jostle with mobs of visitors and then missing the Coronation Chair because it is boxed up to protect it from work going on around it. When that happens, the ticket price should be reduced.It is a grand building but there are more beautiful cathedrals and abbeys. It resembles a mausoleum for the great, the rich, the influential of nearly 1000 years and many of the lasting memorials are grim beyond belief. Kings and queens are squeezed in where there is space and that leaves little space for the mobs to contemplate their lives and their impact on our history and to see their last resting places. Poets Corner is also a resting place for the living as it accommodates lots of folding chairs in rows for the weary tourist. It is not a pretty sight and and that is a shame as the volunteers and guides are willing, informative, knowledgeable and, despite the masses (of tourists), pleasant. Our history is lost, hidden and forgotten in such a clutter. Only the human contact with the wonderful volunteers at the great west door made this tolerable for me."

The whole history of England, indeed the UK, is here with the final resting places of countless Kings, Queens, dignitaries and luminaries from all walks of life. Poet\u2019s Corner is a must \u2013 just to revel in the monuments and burial sites of such diverse groups of artists. A bit like visiting Musicians Corner in the Central Cemetery of Vienna. It is worth reading up some of the tourist guides of the Abbey prior visiting so that you don\u2019t miss too much. A nice little caf\u00e9/restaurant is now on site where you can recharge the batteries before further exploration. Compared to St. Paul\u2019s, there appear to be more monuments and tombs and the design of the building is of a more grandiose scale. Like St Paul\u2019s it does reveal the military history of England with so many of the famous persons celebrated and laid to rest. So much of the stonework, dating back centuries, is of such beautiful craftsmanship and skill that it is a delight to explore the side chapels and crypts. Again, like St. Paul\u2019s, it is a working Church and your visit may have to work around Church commitments. The famous Choir area is a treat to see as we are all familiar with these places after various Royal weddings and funerals over our lifetime. You are not permitted to take photos or videos."

There is so much to absorb here that even as a British person with a tenuous grip of domestic history one feels that you are treading water just to keep ahead. Beautiful, mesmerising, overpowering and empowering. Be better if the balance between worship the essential revenue generation extracted from the tourist were brought together so that those who just want to \"do\" the Abbey appreciate the whole reason it is there rather than just marvelling at history"

My daughter, a history undergrad was most keen to visit QE1 monument which we did with time to really take it all in. We were in the abbey at the right time to take prayers at Edward the confessors chapel very special it felt too. It is a very cluttered building with family monuments obscuring other monuments. Resembling at times an architectural salvagers if that isn't too impertinent to mention. All the same a very special place. Would've stayed for lunch but the prices were pretty hefty not in keeping with a religious place. Look at Durham cathedrals refectory for example"

The London pass includes a audio guide that will guide you as you go along the tour inside the abbey. People are not allowed to take pictures inside, this is to preserve the sanctity of the abbey. There are many famous people that are buried inside they abbey. It is really large, and there are lots of places to explore. Sometimes, there are guided tours offered. We were trying to keep a schedule, so we only went through the highlights of the place. I will go here again if given the chance, so that I can learn more about the place."

Thanks to my lack of research, I was surprised to see that it is the burial place of hundreds, who are memorialized with huge statues mounted over their crypts. Now I have to admit, I am a graveyard gazer. I love to look at ancient graves and imagine the lives of those buried beneath my feet. But this takes it to an entire new level. I greatly enjoyed standing at the burial site of folks I have read about in history books. Maybe that's macabre, but, that's me.We also had the opportunity to take communion in the abbey. My husband and I are non denominational Christians, and my husband is a former Catholic. The service was very reverent and lovely, and I am glad we attended. Though I don't normally care about the building in which to worship, I have to admit that the abbey inspired some deep worship.I also have to admit that I got a kick out of walking down the aisle where royalty was crowned and married. It was fun to see pictures of Prince William walking in the exact place I stood. If you enjoy the history of the British royals, even a little bit, I think you will enjoy the abbey."

Somewhat put off by the high admission cost, we decided to go to the Sung Eucharist service on Sunday morning (no fee when attending a worship service, but no additional sightseeing permitted). It was wonderful. We were seated in Poet's Corner. They have large video screens placed so you can see full service and choir even though some of nave not visible from our pews. The music (boy's choir plus men's choir) was glorious; the service interesting and thoughtful. Got to see much of Poet's Corner during service (Chaucer memorial and window, Dryden memorial was at end of our row; Robert Adams stone was at my feet, Shakespear memorial nearby, and more). And we saw much of church on the way out, including the beautiful windows, many famous memorial stones, (Sir Isaac Newton's , Winston Churchill's, Noel Coward's and others), tomb of the unknown soldier, coronation throne, etc. Did not get to see tombs of the royals, but that was offset by opportunity to enjoy the abbey in use as a living churh, and to hear the choir. I would recommend attending the service even it there was a change; it was even better that there was not."

It is a must-see for any London visitor, and I am chagrined that it's not ranked within the top five attractions for the city. If you are not awed by the Gothic architecture, surely you will be impressed by the names of great people who are buried here. Within this church you will find the last resting place of kings and queens, lords and ladies, great poets, scientists, generals, clergy -- Elizabeth I, Mary Tudor, Mary Queen of Scots, Henry V, Henry VII, Charles Darwin, Sir Isaac Newton, Oliver Cromwell, Chaucer, to just name a few -- and memorials to many other influential and prominent figures of British history. The Abbey is also the home to the Coronation Throne.You can rush through the church in an hour if you skip various chapels. However, for a satisfactory visit, budget at least two hours or more if you're a big history buff or fan of British literature as I am. When we visited last weekend, it was 18\u00a3 per adult to visit the Abbey, which is very expensive (but London is one of the most expensive cities in the world to visit). You will be provided with an audio guide (offered in many different languages), which highlights the history of the abbey and of the people interred there.Photographs are not allowed inside the church itself.If you have the time, I would highly recommend attending an Evensong or Sunday morning service, which are free."

The Abbey is a short walk from these tube stops, providing lovely scenic routes along the way. Westminster is a pretty area within London, so the quick walk will be pleasant.The Abbey is a focal point within Westminster, situated extremely close to the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, the London Eye, the Churchill War Rooms and Buckingham Palace. This area is dominated by government and business aspects of London city life, however it is nonetheless a nice area to walk through and explore.The Abbey:I could not have imagined the beauty and prestige of Westminster Abbey before I actually experienced the real thing. The Abbey holds more than 1000 years of British history. It showcases the prestige of British royalty, including the crypts and memorials to 17 monarchs. Also, it holds the remains and memory of infamous civilians, including Charles Darwin. The Abbey also houses the final resting places for the children of King Henry VIII, notably Queen Elizabeth I, Mary I and Edward VI. At every turn, you will find stunningly carved legacies of infamous individuals.Highlights of the Abbey: The High Alter is the heart of the Abbey. It contains a stunning mosaic and religious artefacts that date back to the 17th century. In front of the High Alter, the 13th century marble floor gleams with stunning colours and patterns. Also, there are 3 medieval tombs just off to the north of the High Alter.The Lady Chapel:This part of the Abbey was my favourite aspect. It was established in the early 16th century and is the last \u201cgreat masterpiece of English architecture\u201d. The fan-vaulted roof, carved statuettes and beautiful stained glass express the grandeur of this chapel. Here, Elizabeth 1 and Mary 1 reside in their competing tombs. The Lady Chapel is exquisitely ornate and detailed. It is a beautiful part of the Abbey, and definitely a must-see.The Poet\u2019s CornerThis part of the Abbey is entirely dedicated to famed British poets, writers, etc. This part of the Abbey contains enormous hand-crafted monuments made from beautiful white marble. There is a large shrine to Shakespeare, which is a highlight of Poet\u2019s corner. You will also see stunningly grand monuments to Tennyson and Charles Dickens, just to name a few.Other Highlights:The Shrine to Edward the Confessor, the Cloisters, Grand Organ, the Nave, Pyx Chamber and Saint Faith\u2019s Chapel.Service:There is a free audio guide that is narrated by Jeremy Irons. At times, it is drawn out and a little dull. However, it provides extensive knowledge and information regarding the history, architecture and legacy of Westminster Abbey. The various guides and volunteers around the Abbey are a great help. They are knowledgeable, engaging and pleasant. Their information was much appreciated and their manner extremely kind. Guided tours are also available.The only downfall of my visit was the no photography permitted. I understand this is a place of worship, but it is also an infamous icon within London. I believe the high fee of entry should enable the use of cameras. Overall:I doubt my review could caption the beauty and grandeur of Westminster Abbey. It is definitely a must-see attraction with London, for the religious and non-religious."

I dressed up but there were definitely tourists in jeans and sweatshirts (so don't be turned off if you didn't pack your \"Sunday best\").

It's hard to write a review, because there aren't many places that offer this depth of history. The graves and commemorations of kings and queens lie a stones throw from great writers, poets, musicians abc scientists. It truly is the story of Britain for the last 1000 years. The building is also stunning, maybe not as ornate or spectacular as some basilicas, but beautiful all the same. I would strongly advise the verger tour, it only costs \u00a33 more than standard entry and for that you get a 90 minute guided tour and also a chance to see the shrine of Edward the Confessor which I don't believe is accessible to those not on the tour. I much prefer to be guided by a person than an audio guide and it isn't much extra to pay. You book a place by phoning the day before, groups are limited to 12, so you get a nice intimate experience. Which brings me to the cost and the reason I'm not giving 5 stars. I know the Abbey is self funding and I know London is an expensive city, but for me \u00a318 entry is just a little too expensive. I actually went on my own as my husband wouldn't have a huge amount of interest in it and we felt it was too much money for him to just keep me company. If it were even a couple of pounds cheaper, that would be something. But even though it's expensive, it is worth it for any history buff. Definitely a must visit when in London."

My recollection is that they are offered twice a day they are fantastic. This is a marvel of history and architecture not to be missed. Enjoy!"

Afterward, we walked slowly out, viewing the fact that CSLewis' memorial had been right behind us where we sat. FUN to think we went to church with CSLewis, in a way. :-) We then had brunch in the little cafe...and that was delicious. The shop had lovely items.

Lots of kings and queens buried in the church as well as some very famous literary writers and poets. The facility is beautiful if all you wanted to see was the splendor of the church or take in the fact of the recent Royal Wedding and how all that took place, a small museum off to the side with some artifacts and wardrobes worn by late king and queens as well as of course a gift shop. They do have a \"tea room\" cafe with bites to eat, we did not take the time to experience that, so can't really comment on that, but the tour was worth the small fee they charged (sorry can't remember price) around 16 pounds maybe. But felt like it was an enjoyable experience. Take in as much as you can or buy a postcard or picture book of the inside, picture taking inside the church is prohibited.

Visited on the 3rd January and the line to get in extended the length of St Margerets church and beyond. Lucky there was a gap in the rain. However the line moved quickly separating at the entrance if you were paying cash or card. \u00a315 to get in , concession rate. OK for one person , but would soon mount up for couples or families. Once inside, it's packed with people, I would worry if I had a young child with me. Saying that, if you have any interest in the history of this country everything is there to see. Just about everyone you have ever read or heard about is there at your fingertips. The carvings on the headstones are magnificent and touching,look for the one to a Mrs Livingstone from her husband. He is shown preparing to fight off the grim reaper coming for his wife, very dramatic. I was there over 3 hours and I'm sure only touched the surface of this magnificent building and it's contents. One minor point, it is a working Church with services at regular intervals. When you are asked to respect this by standing still for a moment please do it."

Did I mention Chaucer, Dickens, and Tennyson all there too. It is beautiful and immaculate and wonderful....from the outside. The inside is slightly more expensive than I would have liked and VERY VERY VERY busy. People everywhere squeezing into each nook and cranny you can find. I hate that over the centuries people have rubbed their hands on everything and have worn down treasures made of wood and stone. Also don't think that you will find a quiet place to sit and reflect. It doesn't exist in Westminster Abby. Not so much a complaint but just something to know, it seems like everyone and their mom is buried there. Plumber for the Abby in the 1600s, sure, you get a plaque. One last thing, make sure you are in the correct line. There is a cash only line and a credit card line. Both will be long. Be sure to visit all the gift shops. The best gifts I brought home from England came from the Abby. Unique glass jewelry and such. Now please dont think that I hated Westminster Abby. It is beautiful. I love that you cannot take photos because it keeps people moving AND it means that unlike Paris, you just have to remember this one, your mind is your only photograph. It is grand. It is tall. It is perfect. It is England. It is the Abby. Just go and realize that the lines will be long and that you will get bumped into."

When we went in 2010 we were surprised at the charge to get in...and it was pretty hefty, we had never had to pay before. Guess we were spoiled by the previously facinating freeby that it once was. This time, the line went halfway around the building. I gave this five stars because it is, afterall, Westminster...but to tell you the truth, we were scared away by the line of people and the time it would take. Went to the Globe Theatre instead. If you don't mind standing in line for a couple of hours, it will be well worth your trouble. Also, didn't mention, it was way more crowded inside on our 2010 trip, more so than ever before! Hard to get back into some of the small places, plan to stand in other lines once inside. I also think it would be well-worth studying the significance of what you will see at Westminster before you stand in line. May not be worth it if you don't know the importance of what is there. It is not like a museum with a lot of explainations...but I do seem to remember an audio tour."

There were two lines just to get in based on how you paid (one line for cash, the other for credit) so make sure you check before standing in line. There is a party store on the corner with snacks so if you missed breakfast or are generally trying to get a head start on the day, stop in there, get a snack and eat it while in line (personal note, getting some spare batteries for your camera would seem like a good idea at first but there is no photography on the inside so don't stress it). Many major events in recent British history have taken place inside but the attraction for me were all the graves, crypts, and memorials to some very famous deceased individuals. It is hallowed ground and tough to imagine that so many tourists step on Isaac Newton's grave every single day. The audio tour is helpful as it does point you to some famous people and places you might otherwise walk past. It will be crowded but is most crowded in areas emphasized on the audio tour so if you don't like the crowds, you might want to walk past the crowd and listen off to the side.Overall, I'd recommend visiting the British Museum and the Tower of London before coming here but if you can get past the crowds (or perhaps around them) and the entrance fee (not cheap, that's for sure), you'll enjoy seeing some pretty famous names and knowing that their remains are closer to you than ever before."

You need to take a moment and stop at the center of the abbey to admire the gigantic size of this abbey and the familiar scenes of events that have taken place here- the last one being Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in April 2011. Before leaving the Abbey on your left, check out the Coronation Chair behind the display glass enclosure. If you have time, do come back on an evening (except. Wed.) when there is an Evensong scheduled at 5p.m. for an hour. Admission is free. You may enjoy listening to the choiristes sing and the ambience of the surroundings and acoustics in the abbey. It is 1st come, 1st served but there are plenty of chairs. You may leave as you wish before the end of the program as long as it is not disruptive. Nice experience to hear the singing."

It\u2019s a great way to see the inside of the church without paying the outrageous tourist fee. Services occur daily at 5PM and last for less than an hour. You need to go to the other entrance (not the main tourist one) and let the guards know that you would like to attend the service. You are provided with a program and then ushered into the sanctuary. It turned out that there was no choir for the service \u2013 apparently they only have a choir on certain days of the week. Regardless, the service was very nice. Neither my husband nor I are Anglican, but the program was very clear and walked you through the service (including when to sit and stand) in detail.

You need to be in the front of the line for this seating privilege. It is worth waiting for the experience of this. Do ask staff about where to wait in line. We just remained in there at the end of our visit but otherwise be outiside the church at 4.30 or a bit before if you can for the best seating.(check the time for Evensong I think it is 3pm on a Saturday). Whilst most things do have a routine this is sometimes altered for special purposes.Remember you cannot take photos but if you have a relative buried there they not only tell you where they are but will allow a supervised photograph as long as you ask the person in the red cape/cloak (sorry I am sure this has a special name). Do try and give yourself enough time for this experience."

It's full of history (of course) and the audio tour and map given out on entry makes it far more than just a walk around a big church ! Having watched 'The White Queen' on TV some of the tombs names were instantly recognisable and the story behind them. Yes it cost to get in but doesn't everything these days ? The only disappointment is that you are not allowed to take photos, other than that it was a very interesting couple of hours."

I felt uncomfortable and not welcome in a Christian place of worship and pilgrimage that has been accessible for over a thousand years. At the end of the service (which was not performed with a Chior; and this appears to be the norm for about 50% of the time). I asked to use the toilets and was told no; if I did not have a ticket (\u00a318 per adult ) it was suggest that I go to the local conference centre or the local pub (both of which are aware and do not welcome such suggestions). During the service there were tourists making noise around the edges of the roped enclosure. No attempt was made to address this by the lay clarks who appear to be no more than cassocked security. I wonder if Christ would be welcome in this building as the spirit of Christmas and the holy spirit is sadly lacking. I'm sure the money lenders of the city would be more welcome than the homeless, needy and naked of the streets of london. I understand the requirement to pay for the upkeep but if the original reason for the building is just paid lip service to they would be better handing the keys over to the NT and stop kidding themself that it is a place of pilgrimage or worship."

After seeing many other beautiful, historic churches and cathederals in Germany and Rome, Westminster Abbey was very underwhelming for a number of reasons.First off, the cost. I understand that as a tourist attraction costs can run up. But this does not excuse the rather pricey entrance fee. The included audio guide is nice, but I would much rather have a smaller fee and the option of purchasing an audio guide, or better yet an actual person. Secondly, the crowds! We went in the \"off season\" in November, and it was still difficult to get around and see things due to crowding around the audio guide points. The church itself was very crowded feeling as well. There were so many memorials everywhere that, to me, it detracted from the church itself and made it feel messy."

If your kids are like mine, they burn out on touring sites pretty quickly. Westminster has figured out how to do it right! Upon entering we were greeted by a lovely gentleman who inquired if our kids would like to do the kids program.We said yes, as it was free of charge. They were given scavenger hunt sheets and pencils and were rewarded at the end (with chocolate) for playing. Again, if your kids are anything like mine, they were \"all in\" at the mention of a prize in the form of chocolate. The result? They lingered longer and listened to the audio for answers, something that is uncommon for a 5 and 8 year old to do. They learned and absorbed more of the history and significance of the church.The benefit, is that by making it a game, my husband and I got to linger longer too and made it more of an interactive whole family experience.If you are going with kids and want to have some fun, find someone in a green jacket and ask to play!

You will also see many plaques in the various \"corners\" - poets, politicians, musicians, scientists etc. We went there on a Monday morning in November and it was busy but not annoyingly full (it is closed for tourists on Sundays). Before leaving take a look at the cloisters and the small museum which has some interesting things including the rehearsal crown, orb etc. for the Coronation. Sadly the garden is closed on a Monday.

Entrance is via the North Gate and on the way we passed the garden with all of the poppy tributes for Remembrance Day.We had to queue for a few minutes to pay and then entered the abbey and collected our audio guides that are available in several languages. The equipment is quite light and easy to use. There are options to listen to more in-depth descriptions available on many of the audio stations. Jeremy Irons is the narrator and his diction is easy to listen to and understand. There are guides in red robes to answer any questions to you may have.The Abbey is not as large as one would expect. In fact it is smaller than several other English and French Cathedrals, although I suppose this is to be expected as it is in the centre of one of the most populous cities in the world.The things to see are primarily related to English history, including tombs of many kings and queens, memorials to rich and/or famous Britons and also Poets Corner. The building itself is well worth seeing.After the abbey itself, one can visit the beautiful Chapter House and a very interesting museum.Our visit took over 90 minutes and was to us worth the money we paid."

My husband and three year old son were as taken with it as I had been, and spent quite a while exploring and listening to the audio guide. My visit was unfortunately cut a bit short, because my 10 month old was evidently not as interested in English history as the rest of his family! But I still had the chance to appreciate the beauty of the architecture and be impressed by the history. It is very crowded, and it's important to check the hours of operation before going (we arrived at about 2 pm on a Wednesday, I believe, only to discover that they close early that day.) Some advice to anyone travelling with a baby: bring a baby carrier! We were very thankful to have brought ours, as the crowds would have made the stroller a impossible (not to mention, several areas are not wheel chair or stroller accessible) Still, despite the cost and the crowds, I found the visit to be worthwhile."

I used the free downloaded audioguide from Rick Steves and listened to it on my iphone. Steves' guide is probably less stuffy than the one the Abby gives you. The inside strikes me as a \"a gaudy monument to posthumous vanity\" rather than a sacred space. The combination of memorials to the dead combined with the crush of tourists made the experience less than satisfying. That said, it was great to see my favorite, the memorials and tombs of great scientists Newton, Darwin, Thompson, Rutherford, Lyle, Joule, Maxwell, Stokes, and Lister as well as those of many famous British writers and poets. I especially like the small stained glass window represented Oscar Wilde given the difficulty he faced in the light of Christian beliefs."

We were very pleasantly surprised that this is a living place of worship - live prayers are made hourly over the public address system and each person is invited to stand still to join in. We also attended a very short but moving service at the shrine of Edward the Confessor, a memorable and worthwhile experience. (This is where Kate and Wills signed the register, if you are into that kind of thing. There is also a very good view down the Abbey through a peep hole. ) As well as these prayers, there are various services throughout the day, details of which are on the reverse of your ticket. Most people showed respect for the no photography rule which is impressive considering the historic nature of the place with the many tombs of the great and the good to see (and a contrast to the disrespect shown in, for example, San Marco, Venice).I love reading inscriptions with phrases such as:HE DYED FVILER OF FAITH THEN OF FEARS, FUILER OF RESOLUCON THEN OF PAIENES, FVILER OF HONOVR THEN OF DAYESas well as the modern memorials you may see in the cloisters. One of the most moving tombs is that of the Unknown Warrior.Outside are figures of twentieth century martyrs - this isn't a place about the past but a site which has deep historical foundations for its modern worship and is very much a place where Catholics and Protestants may join together in prayer.The place is just packed with history, fame and symbolism as well as worship.

Once inside, you're given an audio device. You can pace your tour, either listening to the pre-programmed audio which leads you through major attractions, or you can wander on your own and simply press the numbers on the device that correspond to the numbers on the space you're looking at. Either way, it's a magnificent place to visit, almost overwhelming inits majesty. We spent about 1 1/2 hours there, but you could certainly spent the better part of a day.

Mercifully the queue moved quickly as soon as the doors opened.I can't imagine that the abbey is never not busy, but once the large tour groups began to arrive (about an hour into opening) it was chaos. Hands down, this was the busiest and most congested place that we visited in London.The abbey has a great audio tour. It's filled with information. Tip- when using it, pick a quiet spot and stand still, look at the object after. There were so many people using the audio tours and not paying attention. I was constantly having other visitors bumping into me. The floor is uneven in many places, so in general, pay close attention to your surroundings.The Abbey itself is amazing and awe-inspiring. It is so ornate that it is quite an overwhelming experience.We were let down a bit as we didn't realize that a lot of the famous names on the \"tombs\" are not actually buried at the Abbey. Some very famous people are, but a lot are not. It's not very clear who is and who isn't. I wish that I had read up on the Abbey prior to visiting and knew what to expect.Overall, this is a London must-do. Go prepared to deal with the crowds and allow yourself two hours to full explore the abbey.Like my review? Check out my blog!"

I had only a few days in London, and I didn't get around to the Abbey until my last day in town.Unfortunately, when we got to the doors, there was a sign saying the Abbey was closed for a private function until later in the day. I had other things I wanted to see and knew I wouldn't have time to go visit those places and then make it back in time before Westminster closed for the day - so I left the Abbey saddened that I couldn't see in the inside of this famous church.The outside of the church was lovely, and I can only imagine that the inside is beautiful as well. Too bad I'll never know now, as I likely won't be able to visit the city again."

We arrived as it opened as instructed by our tour book, but I think it backfired, as it was a long enough opening line that the first 15 minutes were crowded until we thinned out. The audio guide (included in admission) is essential. Speak to the staff who are stationed throughout the abbey; they are incredibly helpful and loved to share their knowledge.It is basically an enormous mausoleum, so if you are not interested in the history of the inhabitants, and in spending several hours in contemplation, then I recommend yo come for a service. We did both. We attended a 5 p.m. choir service (not at 3:30 as the permanent sign indicated). Line up early and if you are among the first 25 or so visitors (I mean worshipers!) you can sit in the choir seats. We almost made it into the choir seats so had a fron row seat on folding chairs on either side of the high altar. If you are not near the front you will not see the choir and I think would be disappointed, but you would still be able to contemplate the abbey and exit through the choir area. It is free to attend a service and you see the nave, choir, north transept, stained glass windows, and high alter. Ushers prevent exploration. The service features two readings, a couple of prayers, call and response, etc. It lasted about 50 minutes. The high Commissioner from Uganda and her staff attended and she read one of the readings."

We went as part of The London Pass (which I HIGHLY recommend). The Abbey was very crowded but we went anyway and decided to book a private tour for an extra 3 pounds (worth every penny). We were a group of 15-20 and our tour guide was outstanding. We saw parts of the Abbey that otherwise wouldn't have seen and received more information and insight on this exquisite piece of history in an hour and a half than I could have ever imagined. The Abbey is so expansive and impressive I highly recommend this as one of your stops in London. It's a magnificent work of architecture not to be missed."

            "review": "Spectacular. This site has multiple buildings on it used for various purposes it seems with some of those changing over time. I don't know much about abbeys, but I do know the building referred to as Westminster Abbey, is architecturally and aesthetically spectacular, both on the outside and the inside. It is also incredible to see what it contains inside and the work that has gone into the construction and ornamentation. One of the most beautiful and awesome church buildings I think I have seen anywhere, if not the most beautiful and the most interesting attraction I saw in London. I also think it is as close as one can get to understanding who the significant people might have been who are entombed here, whether they be royal, religious or neither or whatever. The feeling of being in the vicinity of these tombs is difficult to describe, perhaps a bit eerie? It's certainly moving though and worth experiencing, in my opinion. I was surprised with the secular aspect to some of the attractions within. The distinction between monarchy, state and religion appears to me to be blurred, with a lot of the stories, facts and attractions here, which is fascinating and at times peculiar. Tracing and interpreting these 3 areas as they evolve over time would seem a complex exercise. This is no criticism of the attraction, as I imagine this is a representation of real life as it has and was unfolding.I really loved the various buildings' doors and window treatments, as I did the Norman style (I'm to understand) ground floor hallways and rounded arches, which are wonderfully ancient and mysterious looking. The final aspect of this attraction which is worth praising are the gardens. These are really superb, not just for the roses or trellises or espaliered apples, but for the really old and large shade-providing trees. These trees create a very cosy sense of place and space, a microcosm, between the buildings. The spiky chain to stop people entering a small courtyard is a 'nice' touch. I had to carefully climb over it at the request of boys (boarding school pupils?) playing basketball in the next courtyard to fetch their rogue basketball which landed in the garden next to me. And the ball finials and pruned trees within the garden are delightful. I could happily sit here for a couple of hours with a book and a cup of tea and perhaps a crash helmet (a joke!) Beautifully presented attraction highly recommended. With all of these types of attractions, for those with limited mobility, I would recommend buying a ticket beforehand or requesting to go to front of line. From memory though, the line moved reasonably quickly and there is some seating available, if needed, if you ask. Well worth the entrance fee and I am so glad I chose to see this amazing place."

            "review": "You can't deny the history but it would be nice to have a better explanation.... Westminster Abbey costs a phenomenal \u00a318 (\u00a315 for concessions) to enter and, in the process of trying to balance the desire to be a place of worship with being a national monument, it fails at both, sadly. I am sure you can enter if you simply want to worship, but I am not sure I would fancy that with hundreds of people walking past you to look at the tombs of kings, queens, politicians and poets (other famous churches have side chapels for worshippers, which seems to work better, and use the body of the church exclusively for services at set times). The entry fee clearly pitches the place as one of the must-sees for visitors to London but the lack of signage and explanation of what you are looking at lets it down severely on that front, too.You will need a good two hours to walk around and admire the monuments. History oozes from every pore, with the Abbey having been dedicated in 1065 and the present church dating from 1245. The Lady Chapel must have one of the finest examples of a fan-vaulted ceiling in the world. Numerous Kings and Queens from The Plantagenet and Tudor Houses are buried in elaborate tombs, including Queen Elizabeth I and her rival, Mary Queen of Scots. Not surprisingly, there are numerous stairs, so the building is not easily negotiated by those who use wheelchairs.The entry price includes a tape recorded tour, narrated by Jeremy Irons. I had not realised he was so good at speaking different languages... But it only provides snapshots of information and leaves you with more questions than it answers. It is also one of the old-fashioned kind that you have to hold up to your ear, so quite uncomfortable after a while. You can pay an additional \u00a33 for a tour led by a guide, although they are at fixed times and so you would wise to check on line first if you favour this approach.Given a total admission price of possibly \u00a321, it is surprising that the Abbey still has so many donation boxes and it is rather distasteful that you literally have to leave the building via the gift shop! Yes, I know it costs a lot to maintain such an historic building, but the majority of merchandise on sale seemed to have little, if any, connection to the Abbey. (If you like jewellery, on the other hand, you'll be in seventh heaven!) I would recommend the restaurant, though. Soup with bread, fish and chips, and two soft drinks came to \u00a325 including service. While the price was average, the quality of the food was good and the service friendly.Strangely, the loos by the restaurant were clearly labelled for patrons of the cafe only. So I am not sure what those who are \"just visiting\" have to do and the \"free\" plan handed to you on arrival makes no mention of lavatory or baby changing facilities.There are lots of stewards on duty, who I assumed were volunteers. They need to guard against being overly intrusive. While some people might have found them friendly, I got a bit fed up being asked if I spoke English every few minutes as another came up to me!Given the history and the time you need to walk around, \u00a318 is not unreasonable. But as the Abbey is pitching for the tourist market, in which there is no shame whatsoever, PLEASE make it more educational and improve the information available - there is no shame in that, either!"

Incredible visiting the tombs of so many historic figures (i;e, Chaucer, Darwin, Newton, Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I). impossible to adequately describe the majesty, the architecture and the powerful experience of stepping back into time. Viewing the 700 yr old coronation chair, possibly the oldest piece of furniture in England, was a wonder. The Abbey's small gardens are not to be missed, especially the College Garden, said to be the oldest garden in England (look up and see another view of Big Ben). Allow at least 2-3 hrs to take it in.

I had barely walked 20 metres before I saw the graves of William Wilberforce, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Isaac Newton, Sir Edward Elgar, and PM David Lloyd George. I cannot truly describe the feelings of awe at this church. There are no words in any language to feel the honour to walk among the graves of the men and women who have made this world more beautiful and more wise. The soaring columns and floating ceilings, hundreds of feet up, cannot contain it all. Walking on, I saw the graves and memorials of Winston Churchill, David Livingston, Edward the I, William Shakespeare, and George Frideric Handel. Pretty much everyone worth remembering in history is either memorialized or buried here. If you go to NO other place in London, go here. Parliament and Buckingham Palace have one PM and one Queen; this place has about a million of each."

We paid the $3/person extra for the verger led tour and could not have been happier in doing so. Our verger spoke with passion for the subject and his knowledge of the Abbey was incredible. We were taken into several places that the general public could not go at that time without being on the tour, behind the alter and in the choir boxes. The tour was about an hour and a half and I feel that it gave me a greater appreciation of the history there. I learned so much about the history of the Abbey, the kings and queens buried there as well as the traditions that are still being followed today. If you prefer, like I do, a live talking human being who you can interact with, as opposed to a headset then take the verger led tour. For the extra 3 bucks you won't be disappointed. Check the Abbey's website as there are specific times each day that the tours are held so you'll want to plan your trip accordingly. They max each tour at 25 people and there is no advance reservation. We were lucky and had a group of about 10 which was perfect."

It has a special feeling for me, I can feel all those centuries of prayers. There is so much to see, from the tomb of the unknown soldier to the modern martyrs and the 12th century Chapter House. I love evensong at the abbey, I have had the priviledge of sitting in the quire. It is worth arranging your day. The Abbey schedule is available on-line.Say a prayer, light a candle or visit the memorials of the famous.Well woth your time."

Upon entering, we picked up headphones for the audio tour, which manages to cram hundreds of years of history into a nice easy to follow tour. It was maneuverable while the crowds were few, but by the time we left, we could hardly move-- so arrive early! Lots of royal history inside as we'll as burial grounds for many English poets & authors. However, I found the memorials of past kings & queens fascinating, as well as the tomb of the unknown soldier. We bypassed the cloisters, as per Rick Steves...and used the unmarked, free & empty loo (outside the door in Poets Corner)."

This masterpiece is awe-inspiring and overflowing with a thousand years of our history.The admission price is steep (and has risen noticeably since last year) but it is totally worth the investment of time and money. And, true, the monies are re-invested in the obvious upkeep but the price does include a significant audio tour (as does St.Paul's). If you have to question the admission then you had better save your time and just do a walking tour of the area. An alternative to this is the LONDON PASS which we purchased in Canada prior to our trip and we got in to Westminster for free, and had a FASTTRAK which allowed us to by-pass the line-up.Whatever your background, if you travel to London and are truly interested in the culture and historical impact on the world of this nation you would not even question the cost of a one hour dinner to spend three hours in these hallowed halls.And if you REALLY use your imagination, on the way out you can imagine standing beside the Coronation Chair with Queen Elizabeth at her investiture, and THEN, in the doorway where Pipa Middleton's physiology overshadowed a royal wedding! HIGHLY WORTH IT!!!Unfortunately, no inside photography."

            "review": "Not To Be Missed! Magnificent!. Westminster Abbey has been the British Coronation Church since 1066. King Edward's Chair is the throne on which the British King or Queen sits as the crown is placed on their heads. Seventeen monarchs have their final resting place in the Abbey. Historically, the first Benedictine Monks were brought to Westminster about 960 AD. No part of their church remains as King Edward The Confessor built a new Abbey on the same site. This Abbey was consecrated on 28 December 1065. The Poet's Corner located in the South Transept has a lovely rose window. Underneath this window are two medieval carvings. It is interesting to note that this area was not known as Poet's Corner until the 16th Century when a tomb was erected to Geoffrey Chaucer who had been \"laid to rest\" there not because of his \"Canterbury Tales\" but because had held the office of \"Clerk of Works.\" When Edmund Spenser was \"laid to rest\" in the same area, a new tradition was established. Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, and John Dryden are among the poets buried in this area. Composer George Frederic Handel is buried in Poet's Corner as is actor Laurence Olivier. Many monuments pay tribute to other writers who are buried in other locations. Some of those include Jane Austen, William Wordsworth, Henry W. Longfellow, William Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, John Milton, John Keats, George Eliot, Henry James, Thomas Gray, Percy Shelley, Sir Noel Coward, and others. There is a wonderful museum, library and monument rooms, lovely gardens, chapels, and a gift shop. It was nice to note that the tomb which was receiving the most attention during my visit was the \"Unknown Warrior.\" Audio Guides are available. No photography."

The queue isn't massive, they are organised with the purchasing of tickets and have a very well done system of the tour headphones. The way around is well signposted even if you chose not to use the headphones. I highly recommend it though because you can tour at your own pace and its really nice learning everything in more detail.I also suggest learning a little about the people buried there before you visit too. Some people (not naming nationalities) had no idea who they were and I feel it could have perhaps taken away from the experience because it was exciting for me to be that close to such huge people from history!"

Here you walk in the footsteps of kings, queens, and heads of state; as well as on and past the graves of some of the most prominent and influential people in history. To have the opportunity to stand on the site of the Grave of the Unknown Soldier, or to view the Padre's Flag, gives one the feeling of having truly connected with some of history's most poignant times and events. I should mention that everyone involved in the tour, from the security guard who welcomed our toddler with a smile and comment on his beautiful eyes, to the abbot who held him while pointing out the seat which is reserved for the monarch or her designee only, to the tour guides who took the time to show us the location of some of the lesser known artifacts, everyone at Westminster made our visit truly memorable.

So many of the important contents have no information to see. These include royal tombs. You are left wondering whose tomb it is, knowing it must be someone important by the grandeur and the crowns on their heads. The audio tour starts well guiding you along through the great and good of their day including Wilberforce, Newton and Darwin then spends a lot of time on just a few areas e.g. chancel and Royal tombs such as Edward and Henry VII. There are many significant royals buried there who hardly get a mention. I nearly missed the coronation throne by the exit! The volunteers are welcoming and helpful if somewhat apologetic about the inadequate information. There were a few security guards posted about inside and one helpfully answered some of our queries about whose tombs were in the chapels beside the main king Henry's. This person told us the information signs had been removed which used to be provided for visitors when the current Dean took office. I felt the Abbey is excluding a lot of people with the tour cost yet so much of the history of our and other nations is represented in some way here. If the information provided had been comprehensive and tombs etc clearly marked with information signs I would not have left with feelings of frustration and disappointment."

This place breaths with history of many centuries, so many important events in the history of UK took place here. Several members of nobility or men of literature and science are buried here. Very monumental gothic style architecture. Audio guide here is very good and helps you to perfectly orientate in the building."

Notre Dame was free and you could take pictures. Be prepared for crowds , but also be prepared to be awed. Unbelievable art and stained glass windows. The history alone was overwhelming. Wouldn't have missed it on my trip to London."

I really enjoy history and was particularly looking forward to spending time here. It was a drizzly day whn we visited but it was worth the walk and the wait for entry. Since I'm from the U.S., we just don't have churches like this in America. The ceilings, the stained glass, the tombs, the coronation chair, the art.....it was just breath taking. We really enjoyed visiting Poet's Corner. Photography isn't allowed in the Abbey, but they have nice guide books for purchase. It was an amazing place to stop and pray. I think If I am ever lucky enough to go back, I would do one of the guided tours. We heard tidbits as we did our own wandering but learned a lot from the guides."

The guide gives loads of interesting information about the various events held here over the centuries (coronations, funerals, etc.), the architecture and meaning of various symbols.If you time your visit right, the \"hidden gem of the Abbey\" - the Abbey gardens - are definitely worth a visit, more so in summer time when you may be lucky enough to attend a live orchestra performance while relaxing on the lawns of the Abbey school, basically in the shadows of the Houses of Parliament."

Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster, normally called Westminster Abbey, is a famous landmark in London, UK. Its origin can be traced back to as early as 604 AD, but there is no evidence of this building. Edward the Confessor (1042-1066) had an idea to have a palace with a large monastery and an abbey church suitable for royal functions and burials. King Henry III (1207-1272) played a noticeable contribution to the church by spending lots of money to rebuild the entire church in the new Gothic style starting in 1245. The rebuilding was halted after his death, and it took another 250 years for the completion of nave at Westminster. In 1745 the west towers were completed, and the building we see today was finished. The Abbey today still plays an important role to the people of UK and a place of worship. The Kings and Queens continue to be crowned here and have their funerals here. On September 6, 1997 the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, was held at the Abbey. Some Royal weddings also held at the Abbey, including Prince William's wedding on April 29, 2011.Westminster Abbey is in the heart of London, not so far from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. You can take London Underground (Tube) to Westminster or St James\u2019s Park station or regular red London buses will take you near the Abbey entrances. Every year it attracts over one million visitors. It always has long queue at the entrance. You can pay by cash or credit card for \u00a318.00 per adult, which includes a free audio guide tour. Once you get into the Abbey, you can see the nave, stained glass, crystal chandeliers and the grave of the unknown warrior. There are two must sees inside the Abbey - Henry VII's Lady Chapel and Tomb of Edward the Confessor. The Henry VII\u2019s amazing chapel is so unique for its spectacular fan-vaulted roof and its carved pendants. I just could not believe how they could find the way to construct it. The Great Cloister, St Catherine's Chapel Garden and College Garden are the only locations that you can take photos inside the Westminster Abbey. It will be more valuable for the visit if you learn the history of UK before the visit."

What you may not expect are the many shrines around the Nave that have a variety of buried monarchs and impressive statues and other relics. There is also a room in the \"back\" (from the main entrance) that features heraldry of various families and individuals who have achieved deeds of note. And of course, the graves of those famous enough to end up in Westminster (but not famous enough for their own room) -- are literally everywhere.

To see the tombs of kings and queens, generals and admirals, that I had read and studied about throughout my life was amazingly affecting. I was not, however, prepared for Poets' Corner. I am an English teacher and I literally teared up when I found myself standing atop the marker for Geoffrey Chaucer, surrounded by Byron, and Milton and all the rest. I'm also enough of an Anglophile (British mother) to have be profoundly affected by seeing the throne on which Elizabeth II and many of her predecessors were crowned, as well as the choir stalls that I had seen so many times on television."

The Evensong services are usually in the evening but we were able to attend in the afternoon on a Sunday. As we left the church we marvelled at how old some of the tombs were. We even noticed the tomb of Sir Isaac Newton complete with a Sarcophafus or stone coffin that said he was buried there in 1727. The cathedral is truly beautiful as are the choir's voices, I would avoid the 18 pounds entrance fee and go to this instead. The service took a little over an hour."

It was constructed in 1065: 27 kings and queens are buried within, along with the renown statesmen, poets, nobles. The building is so tall that chandeliers ten feet in height look small from the ground. Hours are M-F 9:30 to 4:30, Sat 9:30-2:30, closed on Sundays. The Underground stop is Westminster. The entrance is on east side of the Abbey. It is extremely crowded in the summer, and on Saturdays and Mondays. There are two lines, one for credit card, one for cash. The cash line moves much more quickly. The entrance fee is \u00a318 for adults, and \u00a332 per family (2 adults, 1 child). Children are under age 11 and are \u00a311. We came with three children, ages 15, 11, and 9. However, because we did not bring their passports, we had to pay full price for all three kids, because (as the agent told us) they \"looked big.\" Be prepared: bring passports. We ended up paying \u00a368 for our family--- $100 to see Westminster Abbey.The audio tour, while good, can be difficult to understand with the background noise. We were literally moving in Brownian motion because it was so crowded: it was sometimes difficult to see the inscriptions beneath our feet. It is a hand-held guide with a mono earpiece insert. Because of the crowds, it was not possible to see any of the sights for more than a minute or two. The numbers that are referred to in the audio guide are also difficult to locate.Photography and video are forbidden inside the Abbey. Photography is allowed in the cloisters, a picturesque covered walk for monks linking Abbey buildings. Bathroom facilities are sadly inadequate. They are located in a small building outdoors near Poet's Corners. The ladies' bathroom was at least a 15 minute wait."

To see the Coronation Chair, used to crown every monarch since William the Conqueror, sent tingles down my spine. One truly feels the deep presence of history here.The church wardens are eager to help and advise and share their knowledge of the Abbey, and there is even a fun interactive quiz sheet for younger children to feel involved. There are cafe and toilet facilities and a shop and you can easily spend a morning here.A must see for anyone coming to London on a visit."

The queue for cash (rather than card payment) was much faster.The are so many that are not to be missed - the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Henry VII, Elizabeth I and her cousin, who she executed, Mary Queen if Scots. But you will have your own checklist. It is worth researching the tombs you want to see. There is an A-Z list on the Abbey as well as other sites. I got bored with the superficial commentary so had to go back to find Henry V and Anne of Cleves."

There can be no doubting the important place that Westminster Abbey holds at the heart of the British establishment and the amazing feeling one gets when standing near the mortal remains of so many famous English kings and queens, as well as Mary Stuart and as numerous less well-known buy equally illustrious individuals. The whole place is steeped in history and tradition and clearly well worth the visit. My gripe is with the \u00a318 entrance fee for all adults, which may be acceptable for foreign tourists but should be significantly reduced for UK taxpayers, and any children should go free. We had lunch in the adjacent Cellarium Cafe, which was a mixed bag: my wife's soup was excellent, if pricey, but it was impossible for me to have a plain scone, as the waiter regretfully told me that he would have to charge me the full whack for a cream tea, which includes 2 cream and jam laden scones and tea at \u00a38. I settled for a pot of tea which at nearly \u00a33 was exorbitant. Having visited Durham, St Albans, Lincoln, Norwich, Ely, Rippon and York cathedrals here in the UK, and numerous ones in Europe, Westminster Abbey left us less than enthusiastic, perhaps because of the expectations which were not fulfilled."

Following the guide gives you about a 2 hour tour of the abbey.

If you've seen the Cathedral in Cologne or Il Duomo in Milan you'll find yourself shrugging your shoulders just a little.It's not the architecture that should draw you there. It's paying your respects to the great and good that are interred at the place. Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton, Auden and Carroll and so many others are there and it's just the right thing to stop by and say hi.And after you've done all that, go back to the nave and look for the largest and most conspicuous of all the graves. You will find a very large, very black square, right where you would expect to find the most important figure in all of English history. And right there you will find the tomb of the unknown solider. With no name and no rank, he was brought back from the killing fields of Europe to be buried with the highest honors that a grateful nation can bestow. Stop there for a second and bend your head.Keep in mind, regardless of what the guides and the website says, Westminster Abbey stops granting access a full hour before it closes and the lines are very long.

Glad we got there early, even then waited 20 minutes as the line was long, and it was school holidays. Had a free audio guide which was great. The history is palpable and it is truly magnificent. We were not slow but it still took about an hour and a half."

All in all every reason to be a popular tourist destination."

It is a who's who of British history. We hired a private guide who whisked us through a back entry and told us many, many of the stories behind the people in the tombs (how Cromwell's head was put on a spike and his bones distributed among the streets of London). It was also fascinating to see where the royal weddings and coronations took place. Definitely worth hiring a guide (we arranged one through our hotel) to hear all of the stories."

The queue to get inside was a very long one but it was worth the wait.I would suggest you go there early, around 9 or 10 there is lesser crowd, make sure if you have only cash you are in the cash line and not the card line and vice versa.

We arrived early and did queue for a while, but it was worth the wait. We opted for a verger led tour and were so glad that we did. You can see parts of the abbey not open to other visitors and our guide (Ben) was excellent, both witty and well-informed. We felt that we would have liked to stay after our tour and take more time looking, but unfortunately were due somewhere else! However we went back to evensong and found it an uplifting and very special experience. You should allow most of a day if you want to see everything properly, so although the price seems high it is actually good value in terms of time spent and enjoyment. I don't know how anyone could fail to be moved by such a wonderful building, both as a piece of our heritage and a tribute to God."

It's breathtaking to when you first walk inside and continues to impress all the way through. My wife has an ancestor who supposedly has a memorial statue inside, so we asked one of the volunteers who had a book and looked up his name for us, and sure enough he told us exactly where the statue was and we found it not far from the entrance. The included audio guide (narrated by Jeremy Irons!) is very informative and there is plenty to keep you busy for a good couple of hours.

We elected to walk over early and be in line at just after 900 fro the 930 opening. Lines form at north doors. What a great decision! There were only about 20 persons there and lines are split depending on passes and modes of payment. By the time we entered there were two long lines........We had London Passes so were in the cash line. Once the doors opened it was quickly in with the pass and we were on the tour. The audio sets they provide free are great and run you through a lot of history. Very educational. We toured the entire Abbey and everything it had to offer. We noted that by 1030 the place was getting very busy and where we strolled alone an hour before among 10 people was now jammed up. We were very pleased with our decision to go early as it allowed for a quality visit. If you can, go first thing and you'll be rewarded. As I said in the title, this is a London must do. If you are in a time pinch, go early and you could easily see it in a couple hours without crowds. Enjoy!!"

You can barely move amidst the crowd and you never get a feeling of solace and peacefulness that most churches and cathedrals naturally would bring to you. It's sort of sad in a way. It's like the temple must've looked when Jesus threw everybody out. So much noise and so little piece. I went there the last time in January and it was a completely different experience. If you've only got a few days to in London Maybe your time would be better spent somewhere else where you can thoroughly enjoy the experience.

As it was a very hot day for London (32deg) these priests must have been very thirsty indeed - sipping copious amounts of 'water' from their silver cups. Immediately when finished drinking they meticulously wiped them out. 'Very professional' I thought. Not much time had elapsed when one of these clergymen hurriedly walked past me, heading towards the Cloisters,absolutely REEKING of alcoholic spirit. He passed by so quickly that I didn't have time to berate him. How disgusting that so-called representatives of Christ can selfishly stoop so low!

The website said that worshippers were welcome but when we tried to use the entrance for worshippers, we were sent back outside and told that we could only pray from 4pm that afternoon (3 hours away).We thought we would try and take in some of the Abbey's surroundings and make the most of the time we had there. We had read that there was free access to the Cloisters so we thought we'd see if there was an appropriate place to pray there. Unfortunately as we walked through, we were stopped by a very rude man who shouted at us and asked to see our tickets. We explained that we wanted to pray and that we understood the cloisters part was free. He told us that we were wrong, that they were not free other than when he made that decision. He then gave us a large green card and told us that we could enter the Cloisters but that we had to make sure the large card was visible so everyone else could see that we had not paid for entry. We went in at first but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed by how he had treated us. We decided that it was not appropriate to make worshippers feel like second class citizens in a house of worship and so we left. All in all, we were very disappointed to see that the Abbey is treated as a tourist attraction rather that for its intended purpose of prayer and worship. The staff were incredibly rude and it was humiliating to have to deal with those types of people in a house of worship. Very disheartening and very disappointing."

Of course, the cash only line is quicker and we opted for this one. It took 15 minutes before we arrived at the admission. The cost is 18 pounds and they give you an audio guide offered in different languages. The building outside is very impressive but it is nothing compared to the inside. Wow , it's amazing the audio guide is well done, we learned a lot about the history . Whether you like history, religion or just a royal fan ,, you will enjoy this visit. You can't miss the unknown soldier memorial, the coronation chair , the magnificent alley which took William and Kate at their wedding. You will see where lots of monarchs, writers, poets, soldiers , etc are buried. Some chapels are just breathtaking. I always like to look of the ceilings , it is so beautiful. We spent 1h30 in the abbey, we could definitely spend more. The only negative thing that I can say, is that is it so crowded that you can not enjoyed fully of the abbey- we certainly missed things. But don't miss this visit because of the crowd- you will missed a good opportunity to visit part of British history"

One of my favourite places to visit on every trip to the UK - historically wonderful and a snapshot of British history - especially its kings and queens and other notables - and there are no restrictions on taking snapshots. However, check the hours before you go, since many overseas visitors were disappointed to find it closed early on Saturday,.and it is often closed for special events any day of the week. Take at least one hour to visit the abbey itself (if you are interested in British history) and give yourself another hour to visit the entire complex and other buildings including the historic green behind which is worth a walk, as are the cloisters and Chapter House. I did not notice this visit if you could still do brass rubbings, but if these are of interest the last time I was there you could buy paper and rubbing wax. There are plenty of washrooms in the complex and at least one place to eat and an Abbey gift shop. If you go at the latter end of the opening hours, things tend to be quieter than when the tour buses are out in full force.If you are staying at Gatwick - much cheaper option than staying in London and only a 30 minute high speed train ride away - the Abbey is really easy to reach from Victoria station which serves Gatwick. All you need is a \"tube\" ticket to Westminster or Embankment stations. Buy a tube ticket in combination with your rail ticket from Gatwick and you can save a LONG wait when you arrive in London! Getting to the Abbey and crossing the road can be very dangerous for foreigners (especially not familiar with the opposite side of driving - several groups of tourists had close calls on all of my last 3 visits since traffic moves FAST. Making a \"run for it\" is risky)..Access for wheelchairs in the Abbey is almost impossible, there are a few ramps but the best bet is to concentrate on the outside areas. Also, N.

West Minister Abbey is a must-see architectural beauty that is rich with British history; it hosts tombs of world class heroes like Charles Dickens and Charles Darwin together with a memorial for Isaac Newton. Make sure to read up a little history before you visit the Abbey. It will be much more significant to you in so many ways. The interior includes a statue of the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus and the cloister (a rectangular open space surrounded by covered walks with open arcades on the inner side) leading to the College Gardens. The Abbey is walking distance from the Thames and a great way of spotting other great landmarks like our good old friend Big Ben. You are able to access the Abbey FREE with a Londen Pass (you might want to consider in getting yourself one). Alternatively you can pay daily rates between \u00a38.00 (children) and \u00a318.00 (adults)."

We only went since we had the London Pass and really glad we did. Yes, you are charged to enter. I really didn't see anything wrong with this, it is like paying for a museum.The line was long and almost deterred us, we gave it 5 minutes and once it started it went very quickly. There are two lines one for cash and one for credit, make sure you are in the right one. Just ask someone standing in line.Once inside there are no pictures. There is an audio guide. We got one, but didn't use it on every thing inside. Another note, most people start looking and listening to the audio guide right from the beginning. This is probably the right way, but it is congested. We just quickly looked at the things and moved further up where it was not so crowded and started from there. There are many people buried there and you will be walking over them, you cannot help it. This place branches off into different wings which are older and hold more burials and interesting things, venture on to these wings.I don't know what else to say, but it is a beautiful place that didn't disappoint. I would recommend everyone see this place once. You can take as much or as little time as you want. I think we were there a little over an hour."

To begin with the ticket lady was unfriendly. She refused to sell a family ticket to the family in front of me because they did not have anything to verify the ages of their adolescent children. They paid double what they had planned to get in. I showed her my student ID with a current picture on it, but it lacked a year, so she would not give me the student price. She was very strict. The crowds were massive, but the cathedral is well worth it, especially to see Issac Newton, Charles Darwin and Shakespeare's graves or monuments. The cafe and gift shop both were overpriced, and the cafe was out of many menu items, only sandwiches were left, so I went straight to dessert. The cake was marvelous!"

Our verger was part of Will and Kate's wedding and he related stories from that, also discussing aspects of the coronation ceremony.

This tour was quite thorough (in all we spent about 2 hours here), but allowed us to easily choose what to listen to, when we wanted. I felt that I was given access to every part of the Abbey I wanted to see, and was given information and told stories about these parts. My feet started to ache many points along the way, and I was almost always able to find a seat or a place to lean. Meaning, the site is aware of its visitors' needs, and is not stuffy about people leaning on the walls.Warning: The lines for the bathroom are long. Be sure to keep the printed ticket they give you as certain attractions within Westminster Abbey are technically outside of it and you'll need to show the ticket to get back in.Total bummer: No pictures allowed! I so wanted a picture in Poet's Corner but was unable to take one."

            "review": "Tips Beyond Being a Tourist. Westminster Abbey is not just a tourist attraction - it is a sacred space hidden in the press of thousands of visitors a day. In Christian faith, there is the concept that the soul outlives the body. Here in Westminster Abbey you are surrounded by the physical remains of historical luminaries that include monarchs, poets, musicians, scientists & politicians who would have sought the divine in this space. If you want more than just the tourist experience on a weekday, here are some tips. At 3pm the shrine of Saint Edward is open to pilgrims who wish to join in the centuries old practice of prayer. This shrine is closed at other times unless you are in a tour group. It was during this time of special prayer that the priest remind us, \"You are no longer merely visitors but have become pilgrims.\" Those who wish to pray for healing may do so in one of the prayer alcoves set in the shrine. There is also a time of prayer at 11am but the 3pm is recommended if you wish to remain for Evensong at 5pm (which ends by 6pm). Here is the reason: people begin to be ushered out of the abbey around 4pm. At that time, if you walk around the cloisters and make your way back to towards the nave, you may ask to line up for Evensong. It may seem a little much to have to wait 45-50 minutes for Evensong, but there is a reason for this. If you line up within the Abbey at this time, you will be at the front of the line (they seat you around 4:40pm). Those at the front of the line are seated in the Quire which is the area of wooden stalls between the organ and where the Abbey choir will sit. You may be a little further away from the High Altar but you will enjoy he marvelous experience being in the epicentre of the musical worship experience of the Abbey. If you arrive later, you may find yourself outside the Quire at the Transept or the Nave but it is still an inspiration to worship among the saints of both the present and the past.Whether you are of the Christian faith or not, you may find the experience of pilgrimage and worship nonetheless divine!"

One thing I found very interesting about all of the churches in England and Ireland is the number of military people who were honored and oftentimes buried in the churches. Touring the Catholic Churches in the rest of Europe, they seem to only bury priests and their saints in the churches. The Brits also honor artists. One area of Westminster is called \"Poets Corner\" where the likes of Lord Byron, Charles Dickens, etc., are buried. Shakespeare is honored, but not buried there.It was very moving to stand in the place where the Kings and Queens have been crowned, as well as the spot where Princess Diana's casket rested during her funeral.The throne that has been used since the 1300's is the last thing you see before exiting. Not at all anti-climactic. Lots of beautiful architecture, amazing history, very much worth visiting. I would easily visit there again if I ever had the chance."

Even if you've read all about this place, if is awe-inspiring to be in the PRESENCE of such greatness. For us, it was full of things that surprised us - that the deadly enemies Catherine of Aragon and Elizabeth I are buried in a common grave; that the father of Henry VIII's extraordinary devotion to the Virgin Mary caused him to create the lovely Lady Chapel, with its delicate fan vaulting; that there first was an Anglo Saxon church on this spot before William the Conqueror started building this one - the list goes on and on. An amazing place, on every level possible.Get here before 3:30 PM, that's the last tour group admitted, since evensong services begin at 5 - or come me in through the side door for the service (this is a wonderful place to meditate or pray, and of course there is no fee for that!). We were lucky enough to hear the Westminster Boys' Choir rehearse (celestial!), one advantage of visiting in mid-afternoon.A walk down Whitehall after or before this visit is an added attraction, since the Abbey lies at its foot, and Trafalgar Square at its head. We practised walking before we went to London to get in shape - a good idea, as it turned out, because there is so much to see on foot that you would miss if you took the bus, let alone the underground."

We took one of the tours with one of the vergers. He was extremely informative and could have given us endless English history lessons had he had the time. It was a little challenging to fight the tour \"moochers\" but the guide did his best letting people know we were \"special.\" On the tour you get to visit the center chapel, not open to the general public, and get to see some of the more significant tombs up close. Try to get one of the later tours and you will get to hear the rehearsal for the evensong. It is truly heavenly."

The Abbey has become such a familiar sight on television and in the press, particularly in recent years and having seen it from the outside numerous times I was really keen to visit. As such, it was always going to be an interesting building to see and on that level, didn\u2019t disappoint. The Abbey is open to worshippers for free use and there are daily services but for other visitors there is a \u201ctourist\u201d option. An easy to use audio guide in a number of languages is included in the entry charge, which takes visitors round 20 of the key points of interest and ensures people keep on the move in the same direction. There are also \u201coptional extras\u201d for those who want more detail, for example on the Coronation Chair and the Eucharist service. I was surprised at how different the Abbey looked inside from my expectations. For a start many of the camera shots are taken from high in the roof and give the impression of a vast open space whereas there are actually quite a number of divisions between different areas. The sheer volume of tombs and memorials is quite astounding and I was surprised at how little their placement seemed to have been planned as part of the whole \u2013 they appear to be squeezed in when a gap is perceived! The Lady Chapel is especially beautiful and it seems amazing that it has survived completely intact through the Reformation and all subsequent turmoil, and remained unblemished during the Blitz.So, undoubtedly there is much to appreciate. However, I always find that when visiting religious buildings and sites, part of what makes the experience special is the quietness and stillness that often remains inside. The Abbey is such a popular attraction that this was completely lost due to the number of people there. In addition, while I feel the entry fee is justified in light of the huge cost of running and maintaining such a building, I was quite uncomfortable with the presence of the Coffee and Gift Shops and particularly the fact that both were mentioned as \u201cthings you may wish to do at the end of your tour\u201d on the audio guide, further emphasised with needing to leave through the Gift Shop. I just felt that both could have been a little more understated, perhaps located just outside, and do not feel this would have had too drastic an impact on their success. Finally, I felt that the staff I encountered appeared quite disinterested and were not especially welcoming, clearly feeling they were there to \u201cdo the job\u201d as a transaction rather than greet and engage with visitors. It\u2019s not something I would usually particularly notice so it must have been fairly marked."

We arrived early and there was hardly a queue to wait in. The audio guide that is included was very good and highlighted the important areas and antiquity of the Abbey. The difference between Westminster and St. Paul\u2019s cathedral is remarkable. Both must be seen to be appreciated. Both are included in the London Pass which takes the cost down. Even without the Pass, I would consider this to be well worth the admission. Unfortunately, as in most important places, photographs are not allowed. The elaborate tombs of Elizabeth I, Mary I and Mary Queen of Scots, the Coronation Chair, Poet\u2019s Corner and so many other special places. Very nice to be in the same place where Prince William and Kate were married.Next time will come back for an Evensong or service. Can't imagine how wonderful that would be!"

The regular choir wasn't there but it was still magnificent. We were in there for about an hour and really enjoyed the service. There is no charge for the service and you are ushered out once it's done, but it was better than paying 18 Pounds each to see the inside of the Abbey. Check it out if you have a chance."

Yes the building is impressive and there is a lot of history there, but to me, it was not really worth the admission fee. The kids obviously were not that interested in it, and if it hadn't been for my husband's insistence on having to see the place at least once, I would not have even bothered. It is a bit difficult to enjoy this attraction with little kids in tow, to kids, it must seem like a dull and dreary place. After an hour or so, we were all ready to go. Luckily Big Ben and Houses of Parliament are nearby so the walk is a nice scenic one with great views of surrounding sites.Nowhere decent nearby to eat though, so pack a little something with you or plan to eat after leaving the area."

With hindsight, we should've been there earlier in the day, however only got there at about 10, so ad to queue, though the queens moved quickly and the security guard was good humoured. As noted by others, entry was expensive, but then this is a 'must see' location. Sadly, with 2 children, 7 and 2, we struggled with the audio guides and found the kids quiz a bit tough when the place s literally heaving with people.Every square inch is historic and people are directed round in one direction, occasionally interrupted by impromptu diversions and closures. Unfortunately, if you need to go back, it is not straightforward to do so, partly due to the sheer volume of people! We stopped mid tour to visit the refectory (pleasant, if expensive) and then again to go to the toilet (yes, there are toilets in Westminster Abbey, but they're not signposted as presumably they don't actually want people to use them...), which caused untold misery trying to get back into 'the flow' of tourists. There is lots to see however I think I have resigned myself to returning in a few years time with older children and more patience."

As a solo traveler, I enjoyed joining a very small group of other visitors (two couples and a few solo travelers like myself) who didn't mind paying a wee bit more to have a \"live\" guide. \"Our\" verger had a great personality and made our visit to the Abbey something very special. Afterwards, I had a wonderful lunch at the Cellarium Caf\u00e9. I was impressed by the unique selection of salads available on the menu. The Cellarium -- part of the 14th century fabric of Westminster Abbey -- is where the monks kept their stores of food and drink!

The day before we had watched, on television, the celebration service in Westminster Abbey of the 60th Anniversary of the Queen's Coronation and then, of course, before that there had been the spectacular Wedding Service of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the sad funeral of the Princess of Wales! We had just left a tour of the Houses of Parliament and were a little shocked to have to join a long queue to enter the Abbey where the entrance fee for a family of adults is not insignificant at \u00a318-00 a head. It was very crowded but the free audio tour, recorded by Jeremy Irons with just the right delivery, made for a comprehensive tour of the Abbey and was easy to follow. You can feel that you are in a Mausoleum of dead Kings, Queens, the aristocracy and the famous and you do need to bring yourself back to the fact that you are in a working Abbey, dedicated to serving God and the Monarch. A visit is a must in anyone's itinerary. We will return in the Winter months when it might not be so crowded. This will allow us the space to really appreciate the beautiful architecture and not feel pressured to keep moving so as not to be in the way of others."

Just standing in the Abbey is awe inspiring and you do not have to be religious to appreciate the work that went into its construction. Like so many of the great churches in Europe, it harkens back to a time when the common man was illiterate, and he was inspired to experience God through visual form. The building is beautiful, but when you take into consideration the amazing events that have occurred inside its walls, along with the remarkable people either burried or commemorated, you're left gob-smacked with the intense relevance of the building to our understanding of modern Britain and the Commonwealth.

Despite visiting London on numerous occasions over the years, I have never visited Westminster Abbey before, but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. It was very busy outside, but once inside the atmosphere is very calm. The audio tour is free and very good. The staff are also very helpful and friendly so don't be afraid to ask any questions. The history within that one building is truly stunning - amazing to see just how many key figures are buried there and over such a very long time."

(Vergers are volunteers who are like museum docents.)For only 3 pounds additional to the entrance fee, you get a fascinating 90-minute tour. The Verger was knowledgable about all sorts of interesting stories and facts about the Abbey.You can book a Verger Tour 2 days in advance by calling the Abbey phone number. The lines at the entrance were quite long. We had a London Pass which includes entrance to the Abbey and we did not have to wait on line. Be sure to check the Abbey schedule before you go because they are closed some days.We also had lunch at the restaurant at the Abbey. It was very nice and very convenient. You can find information about it on the Abbey website. You can also make a reservation. I DO recommend a reservation. They are very crowded at lunch with long lines.

It is difficult to visit and not think of the lives of the people who built the place, who prayed there and who are entombed there. Some people have complained about the high entry fee, they are correct, it is high and it is worth the price, especially if you want to take pictures. If you do not want to take pictures you can see the inside of the church by attending a prayer service."

Elizabeth I is buried with her sister Mary I and the audio tape has touching and interesting information about the sisters being together in death as they never were in life. Jeremy Irons narrates the audio guide and it is interesting and too overly informative ... for some that is a good thing but I wanted to know more.

At the end of our visit we lost 2 people from the group (this all turned out well in the end). Everyone in the abbey was super helpful, and allowed us to exit and re-enter a few times as we looked for our people. The verger of the abbey even announced their names over the loud speakers...can you imagine having your name announced at Westminster Abbey? The only unhelpful person was a grumpy ticket booth person who took our tickets off us so we could not re-enter the abbey. In times of concern for other people it is off putting to encounter a mean person when everyone else was eager to be helpful."

There are two lines to get into Westminster which are \"Pay with Cash\" and \"Pay with Credit\". If you have the London Pass, you can go in either line. Both lines were about the same length and only took us about two minutes.The tickets are \u00a318 for adults, not sure the price for children. Once inside you receive an audioguide which is included with the ticket. The guide takes you on a nice path around the Abby. When I first came to Westminster I was 11 years old. My siblings (all younger) and I enjoyed having our own audioguides and still consider our visit to Westminster to be our favorite site in London.Tip: This might be an overall tip for London, but I would say that if you enjoy history or are hoping that your children learn a lot of history during your visit, do some prep work. So many Kings and Queens in English History have the same names. Try to find some sort of diagram or picture (like a family tree) to give your kids...or use yourself. This visual aid will help them remember what they have learned better."

Having said that, our time at the Abbey was structured differently than most visitors and I can understand some of the negative comments. First this is a functioning church not just an attraction that is focused on tourist business so be prepared for changing hours, areas that might be inaccessible at time of your visit etc..Secondly yes there are crowds at times, there were long entry lines when we visited at mid morning but no lines at around 2pm or so when we walked by a few days later. TIP -there was a cash only line that was shorter that we availed of. The entry fee is around 18 pounds as noted in other reviews - we spent an extra 3 pounds for the guided tour and it has to be one of the best values ever- a highly informative and entertaining tour by an Abbey verger -highly recommended! Lastly if you are so inclined consider attending a service at the Abbey, there is no charge and it can be a moving experience. We attended matins (10 am service that is mainly sung) and the choir was in superb form and came back a couple of days later for the guided tour. Recommended."

You are given a free audio guide which helps to lead you around the abbey, but as you're viewing the sites and listening to the commentary, you are surrounded by dozens of other tourists doing the same, standing in the same spot.

            "review": "Beautiful Gothic church, but very cold and unfriendly place.. Westminster Abbey is a beautiful Gothic cathedral in Parliament Square. It has soaring pillars which give the impression of great height. Some chapels are areas have ceilings consisting of beautiful fan vaulting. The fan vaulting, a late development in Gothic architecture, is probably the finest in the UK.The Abbey is the resting place for many great people. Among the tombs are the splendid tombs of some British monarchs, including Queen Elizabeth, and Mary. Poets\u2019 corner contains the tombs of some of Britain\u2019s great writers and poets \u2013 Geoffrey Chaucer and Charles Dickens to mention just two.The Abbey is a beautiful building, both inside and out. Do not forget to view the cloisters with the windows looking over the green secluded space, and some with hauntingly beautiful glass workThe cloisters lead out to the Dean\u2019s yard, and other romantic and beautiful spaces in the heart of London. These areas can be accessed from outside without entering the Abbey, and it is worth exploring this beautiful heart of London.So, why do I rate this attraction so low? There are several major areas in which the attraction serious fails. In some cases the problem can be mitigated by forward planning, and initial preparation. However, other issues cannot be avoided, and need to be weighed up. I look at what these problems are below.1. It is essential to plan your visit. The Abbey shuts its doors early, and sometimes is shut for the preparation for events. It is essential to look on the internet to check up opening times. A morning visit is better than an afternoon one since the church shuts very early.2. The entrance cost is extremely high. The current rate is \u00a318.00 per adult, with no concessions for elderly people.3. A lot of important sights are not available to visit. I visited when the rear of Lady Chapel was closed off for renovation. This meant that a lot of royal tombs were not accessible, and covered in plastic sheeting. This was not mentioned at the entrance when paying entry, nor mentioned on the internet. 4. The tomb of Edward the Confessor is inaccessible except at certain times for short periods. This is not mentioned at the entrance. It is possible to see it, but you must find out about access times, and ensure you can get in with the guide.5. There is very little information available. There are short notices about some of the items, but very little. There does not seem to be any form of annotated map with useful information. The visitor will need to obtain this information prior to entry. The Souvenir shop is situated outside the church, and I am not sure that they will allow re-entry.6. There are a lot of wardens, all pompously dressed. They appear to be trained to be unfriendly and unhelpful. I watched in amazement at the way that visitors entering to attend a service were strictly queued up, and had to wait in an orderly line to enter the service. 7. Photography is forbidden \u2013 and strictly policed. That is despite the fact that the visitor has paid a substantial amount of money to enter. I found my visit very wearisome. There are few places to sit down and meditate. It is a beautiful building, a very beautiful building. It is also a very cold and unfriendly place."

Having travelled around in Britain, London is the only place where I'm not allowed to take photos in churches. They claim it is for religious reasons/house of worship. Is there a special London religion...? Strange and very sad since the variation of book and postcards in the shop not nearly gives you the opportunity to buy your photos instead. Poor photos, to few photos and no proper photo book of the place. No photo policies without a good reason sets down my grade by one."

At a whopping 18 UKP/adult, we almost decided against it, having to return a second time when we learned the attraction's strange hours. Still, both of us were glad we went in. Breathtaking historical value. The digital guides are the only way you'll learn a thing, so make sure you get one (no extra charge). We were wary at first with the rather boring voice (the guy who played Scar in Lion King ;) ), and the slow-moving crowds, but we quickly became entranced by how many famous people had been touched by the artifact. Takes a little patience to get through the lines and empty your wallet - but it's probably not one you want to cross of the priority list."

The choir is fantastic, of course, and the organ is a joy to listen to. Of course, being there for service means you don't get to look around at all. I went back on a weekday to join the hoards of tourists. The audio guide that is included in the admission is barely adequate. I feel like it tries to move you thru the site fairly quickly, giving you a little bit of interesting information here and there, but overall lacking details. There were other people there with their own private tour guide and I wish I would have known to find one for myself."

Be sure to learn about the numerous people of note who have occupied the seats throughout history, and to this day. While we were there a priest told us they just heard Dame Margaret Thatcher had died, and by the time we arrived at the Quire the staff were preparing her seat for the services that would eventually follow. When we were almost ready to leave, a boys/mens choir began singing/chanting....it was so beautiful. Be sure to time your visit to take this in, such a peaceful time.

So as a one of the most-see attraction in London the whole experience is not great which was also compared with other couple and groups visiting the Abbey, all having the same opinion.

I have planned to visit this site on a weekday in order to find most of what there is about to see open for public access, such as Pyx Chamber, cloisters, gardens, etc. On the day, I found two very long queues, one for cash paying visitors, another for plastic cards. Took the cash queue, and traffic moved slowly but surely. Was done in about 10 minutes. So far so good. At the cash counter, I paid GBP18 which is hefty in comparison to other places, but I knew in advance of. However, upon entering the building, I was taken aback. Hoards of people filled the place with no one to guide them (except for those with an audio guide). At times, visitors would simply enter a nave without giving others inside time to exit so as to make more place for them. The abbey looked dark inside as well. Then the pyx chamber was closed. And so on.I suggest that access to the Abbey is made by advance booking only and by means of timed tickets (similar to Madame Tussauds), thus limiting the influx at any one time. Additionally, for the price a visitor is told to pay, he should find more ushers inside to guide the flow (to my knowledge I saw only a pair during the entire visit). Ultimately, if an area is advertised that it opens during a specific time-frame, than the administration should see that they stick to that.Would I recommend this place to family and friends? I'll them of my experience, and to save time and money and visit Hampton Court Palace Gardens instead"

We felt like we were constantly pushed through the Abbey to make way for more people, and while the architecture is beautiful, the memorials on the walls are distracting from the true beauty of the Abbey. Overall, if you're in London it's a must see, but be prepared to be underwhelmed."

I was blown away by how marvelous it is and would love to go back. The chapels are fascinating, especially thanks to the audio guide commentary by the deep tones of Jeremy Irons. My only criticism is that whilst we were in the garden the abbey closed for mass and they didn't leave any signs for an alternate exit. We eventually found our way out though.In the gift shop I asked if they had a postcard or picture of a particular statue that I liked (you can't take photos inside the abbey) which they didn't have but kindly told me that I could order a copy from their library. Very helpful indeed."

Seeing the Abbey from the outside was nice, but touring the inside was phenominal. The audio guides were helpful and allowed you to listen to additional details if you were so inclined. There was a lot of history inside of the Abbey. Most interesting to us was poets corner. The royal history was good too, but we don't have a good understanding of all the royal bloodlines to truely appreciate some of the tombs. Once inside the Abbey, the staff seemed to be very helpful. They were interacting with elementary age kids as it seems they were on some sort of \"scavenger\" hunt for information in the Abbey...probably to make sure the kids were engaged in the experience. Since we were not allowed to take pictures while inside, we bought a souvenir book at the Abbey shop afterwards. Highly recommend a tour if your schedule permits."

It's a magnificent structure built in 10th century ( can't believe, they build this kind of building without crane) it's not just a church where kings and queens were coronated and married, also I learned, it's a resting place for royals, famous writers and poets (C.Dickens, C.Bronte) well-known composers and politicians.

I quickly realized it was the lack of photo lighting and the high mounted camera angles that made the difference in the feel of the place. That understanding having taken place, I took the guided headset tour through the Cathedral. Listening well, I scoured alcoved altars all along the sides that were filled with the sarcophagi of the ruling class. A history of sinners and saints poured out from room to room, each with its own personality and its own story to be told.I became so enveloped in the history I heard and saw that when the call for morning pray rang out, it startled me. Taking off my headset and bowing my head I prayed along, only to open up my eyes to find I was praying over Chauser's marker on the floor. I didn't think that he would mind. So much to see, so many names familiar to us all, requiums for the greatest people the empire ever knew, there was so much to explore there. I could have spent much more time at Westminster Abbey than I had that day. It is on my list for a repeat visit the next time I'm in town"

Westminster Abbey is maybe not the most obvious place to visit with two kids, when touring London, which is so rich in action-packed and more tantalizing attractions more aimed at the younger.But after having walked for just a short while in the cathedral itself and trying to communicate our meager knowledge, it was fascinating to see how it caught their interest. We opted out of the audio guides, as English is not out native language and it was more necessary to look at the things and try to explain than to listen to the by no doubt excellent audio-guide.Free maps and material for the kids are distributed by volunteers, easily recognizable in their green robes.You have to adhere to a certain route round the Abbey, which makes sense, as there a many people visiting the place.Personally I loved to see the different memorials - especially the one for Isaac Newton, but our oldest daughter who's an avid musician also easily spotted the memorials for composers she has been playing works by; Henry Purcell, George Frederich H\u00e4ndel, Edward Elgar, Benjamin Britten, and Muzio Clementi. Impressive that the names has caught on.This is indeed a place for grasping the history of what would become an icon of british royalty (all coronations have been here - eventually) and the Imperial dreams of a country.For the royalists of many countries, the central nave and the benches at the organ will most likely be remembered by anybody viewing the recent royal wedding on TV.The Abbey originates from 1042 and has a long history of additions and rebuilding, all this can be read somewhere else, but do see for yourself.Nearest tube station is Westminster, and you can the just as well have a look at Big Ben at the same time..."

I don't have the eloquence to describe the magnificence of the Abbey but suffice to say it gives one a very tangible connection to the key personalities of hundreds of years of European and World history. Ergo my following comment may appear irreverent and disrespectful but I can assure the reader that I am most sincere. I unreservedly I direct any visitor to the Cellerarium cafe within the Abbey precincts and further suggest you purchase a bowl of chips there - they are no less impressive than the surroundings. 'Don't know how much they were - coz a dear friend bought them for me - but they were memorable and delicious.We were asked to share a large (12 seat) table in the restaurant and we enjoyed chatting to several visitors in a most friendly and relaxed environment."

The building is huge and complex, with many chapels and shrines. Like the Duomo, one could visit every day for a year and keep encountering new things. A half day is what's needed to enjoy a Who'sWho.One caveat: The admission charge is high and seems out of place for a house of worship. Although everyone's money is welcome, the Christian message that goes out over the sound system at least hourly is undiluted for those of different faiths."

As our guide said, 900 years of history in 90 minutes PHEW.You do rush thru, but you get to see areas of the Abbey that general visitors don't, so that in itself is worth it.Groups are a max of 20 people which is a good size, especially when the Abbey is busy.Our guide, Peter, involved the children who were in our group and helped them complete the kids guide/questionnaire.Sadly we didn't have time to go back and get the audio guide, and retrace our steps. To do this you really need a good few hours (tho we'll be back for sure).Sadly, but understandably you can not take photos so we bought a book at the shop as a momento (and of course, with many more explanations of things we didn't see)Highly recommended."

That aside, Westminster Abbey is fascinating, full of history and a must-see in London. You are not allowed to take photos inside - take all you can outside, the architecture is stunning.There are memorials just everywhere you walk, it is really full of history. The greatest people in the UK are buried here and have been for centuries - Prime Ministers, Kings and Queens and all the great and good. There are memorials to Darwin, Newton and the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.The audio guides are excellent and give you a lot of information. We saw a vergers tour - we were too late to join it, but it sounded superb. If you have children, pick up a children's trail at the door, this is a good way to keep them involved.Poet's Corner was my favourite place - every literary name you can think of is here including Dickens, Hardy, Tennyson, Kipling and more. There is a statue of Shakespeare resting his hands on a pile of books and the tomb of Sir Laurence Olivier is beneath this.The entrance includes exploring the Cloisters and the museum. You can see the Coronation Chair on the way out -unfortunately covered up during our visit as it must be having work done on it. Since 1066 monarchs have been crowned seated on this chair in the Abbey.We went back again for Evensong at 5.00. This is wonderful and I highly recommend it. You need to queue at the gates from about 4.15 onwards, they let you in at 4.30. It gets really busy - we got there at 4.15 and got seats near the front. The music, atmosphere and Book of Common Prayer Service was a real highlight for me and unforgettable."

If you attend a service there you are not allowed to tour the tombs, but it is an amazing and historic feeling to know you are taking part in traditions that date back hundreds of years. When touring the Abbey, the audio guide is interesting and makes the experience much more fulfilling because otherwise you might miss some of the tombs sine many areas are overwhelming. Some of the tombs are also a bit difficult to fully see; there are protective gates around them which obstruct views (although they make sense to have!) The Lady Chapel and Poet's Corner were especially interesting to see. Attending service there was a very calming experience while touring it was a bit stressful due to so many people and student groups. Not to be missed, just decide which way you would like to experience it!"

If u will go unprepared, chances are there that u will miss something of ur interest. Atleast make a list of persons who are buried here (such as Newton, Darwin etc.) and u want to see their final resting place. 2- Do take a guided tour. The tour price (around 2-3 GBP) is much lesser than the entry ticket (around 18 GBP) that u have already paid for. This guided tour will take you to some places that are closed for general public and will make sure that in the limited time available, u get the most interesting and relevant info.The down side is that u cant take pictures inside the abbey, even without flash."

But totally worth it!The buildings themselves are magnificent. And when taking the free audiotour, you get more history than in an entire course (well, almost). Everything is impressive. There are no words to describe it.Also, don't think this has anything to do with religion. I am an atheist, and have taken this tour twice now; I love it. It's all about history, politics, architecture etc.Take at least half a day for this, as it is rather large. Also, try to pick a weekday if you can; the place can get horribly crowded, but on a Thursday in January we could easily manouver even the small rooms and passages.While you're here, have a drink/bite at the Cellarium Caf\u00e9!"

For 30 minutes we soaked in the music, the high interior walls and ceiling, the stained glass and the great names of history and Christendom\u2026\u2026David Livingstone, William Wilberforce.

The Abbey is a very interesting building, as it was built over a couple centuries, and has hundreds of memorials and graves. Learning the history of the monarchy, the stories of Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I, the history of Poet's Corner - all fascinating. Try to book at a time when you can get up into the Shrine of Edward the Confessor - amazingly quiet in the middle of the hubbub of this building. It is very expensive to get into, and it's too bad that photos cannot be taken, but given the age of the structure, that is understandable."

I was put off by the price and the preconception that it was \"another bloody church\" and I wouldn't enjoy it. My kids desperately wanted to visit so I relented.The last time I visited was circa 20 years previously when visitors were largely left to their devices to explore. Visitors today are given a handheld audio tour device which describes each of the key features. This massively enhanced my visit and made the tour so rewarding.My little one got a tresure hunt / quiz to complete which kept her fully entertained and was rewarded with chocolate at the end.All of the staff we met were enthusiastic and informatice and were a real source of information, and a source of entertainment for the kids.Overall - Massively exceeded my expectations!"

It is expensive to get in but if my contribution helps us to retain such an iconic building then it's well worth it. I was totally unaware just how many people are buried there. Elizabeth 1st and Mary Tudor, also Mary Queen of Scots is there too and many other members of royalty. I was unaware that Geoffrey Chaucer was also buried there, which has encouraged me to buy a copy of Canterbury Tales. Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton too and numerous Prime Ministers. You are given an audio gizmo which is free and is very informative. I heard the choir practising for Choral evensong. They sounded heavenly, so moving, wonderful.

However, there is so much to see inside and the audio guided tour is so well done. It's hard not to be moved by the tombs of the great and the good buried inside the abbey, together with the facts that nearly all of our monarchs have been crowned in this beautiful space since William the Conqueror, plus the recent wedding of William and Kate! I must also mention the cellar cafe where the four of us enjoyed a really tasty and good value lunch, made better by the fact hat when my husband happened to mention to the waitress that the homemade soup whilst being very tasty, was quite salty, fetched the manager, who said that she had tasted the soup and also found it to be salty, thanked us for the feedback and took the price of one soup off our bill!

I would not consider going here in a proper tourist season because it was about at the limit of what I would consider enjoyable. At \u00a318 for two of us it was fine, but she turned 11 a few days later, and it would have been a lot more then - which would warrant reconsideration if time were tight.I got a real kick out of the history - Cromwell, Elizabeth and Mary, Mary Queen of Scots, Henry VII etc. Poet's Corner was good, although half of them are just plaques and not tombstones, so not quite the pantheon of tombstones I had expected. Compared to other historic churches (eg Winchester Cathedral), this felt more like a tourist attraction as it was so overrun, but still it was definitely worth seeing. My 10yo was not as impressed as I was, but there was enough to keep her interest.

Being among so many of the \"who's who\" of history, standing where so much history as taken place, is somewhat of a surreal experience, to be experienced at least once in a lifetime.We went after 1:00 PM on a Monday in January and walked right in, received our audio guides, and spent 1 1/2 hour with absolutely no crowds or lines. It is a sobering, huge place of worship, with services possibly being held while you are there. (Don't expect it to be \"entertaining\".) It is beautiful in a haunting kind of way. Really makes you think of times gone by and their significance. (Would probably not be the best for children).We also attended the Evensong service. The service is at 5:00 pm weekdays. They ask everyone who toured the Abbey (and paid the admission fee) to leave by 3:30 pm and then allow those who want to attend the free Evensong to line up again, about 4:30 pm.Those first in line are asked to sit with the Choristers in the Abbey, (if there is space, after the parents of the Choristers are seated.) There were plenty of seats, however, not being early considerably limits the view of the proceedings, as you are off to the side of the main center aisle. The 45 minute service is definitely worth attending, whether you are religious or not, if just to hear the gloriously harmonious Chorister's voices echoing throughout the vaulted ceilings of the Abbey. There are instructions of what to do during the service (when to sit, when to stand). The High Commissioner of India spoke at the service we attended.You will only be able to view the perimeter tombs as you pass by upon entering and exiting for the Evensong service, but if you just want to see the main interior of the Abbey, without paying the entrance fee and viewing the major tombs and gaining additional information, this will do. Some have commented that they were abruptedly asked to leave after the service, but this is understandable as the Abbey is funded only by entrance fees. While worship is free, maintenance and upkeep is not. We noticed some areas of the Abbey could use a nice \"refresh\", but apparently, entrance fees are not sufficient to keep it pristine.Pictures are not allowed at any time, especially not during the service, as expressed \"you are here to worship, right?\" A subtle message to the tourist versus the worshiper! Amazingly worth it, free or paid!"

The Abbey's young 'Choristers' sang during our Monday evening visit... beautiful! And the High Commissioner for India read as part of the worship service. We were part of only 50-60 attendees since these church services, open to the public, are unpublicized, but held widely in the UK (We've attended like events in Oxford, Bath and villages).

The audio guide was useful in that you could hear more about specific areas, but I found that the numbers on the objects were very poorly marked and I found myself lost several times. I guess I am not as technical as some people. I was the last to leave from my group and that was after I finally gave up and stopped the audio portion and instead just looked around. I dont know if actual tour quides were available as I was just ushered towards the audio tapes. Alot of history in this place. Charles Darwin was one of the famous names buried here. Lots of royalty as well. If you are using the audio tape plan on hearing everything plan to spend plenty of time. I lost my party and went outside to look for them by the outside gift store. A guard almost didnt let me back in, luckily I had my receipt. My friends totally missed the monk section and gift store. I think it wasnt on the audio tour and I had given up by then and was just wandering. Little costume museum at the inside gift store worth seeing."

Every step you take, corner you turn etc there lies either a grave or memorial to an historic English figure - be it King, Queen, playwright or even perhaps an unknown soldier. However, for some reason the experience left me feeling cold and underwhelmed. I'm not sure if it was owing to being busier than St Paul's, the poorer phone devices that you had to walk around with or another unknown factor. What is certain though is that St. Paul's will remain in my conscience a lot longer."

That being said, this is a wonderful place and full of English history with something new at every turn. If you're there at 11.00 or 3.00 you may be lucky enough to get into Edward the Confessor's chapel and tomb which is closed off at all other times due to its age and fragility. Henry 7th's Lady Chapel is suberb and a must-see. The newly refurbished Cellarium restaurant is small but perfectly adequte with good food and friendly staff but is again on the expensive side. All in all a great way to spend a couple of hours."

It's such a historical place and associated with significant funerals (i.e. Princess Diana's) and recent royal weddings, among other things. Our boots came to a screeching halt and our eyes nearly came out on stalks when we saw the entry fee the Abbey now charges. Daylight robbery! They should be ashamed of themselves. We suddenly didn't feel the need to go in. However, there are many people who simply could not afford this. Maybe that's their aim. Keep the riff-raff out.

            "review": "\"I was glad ...\". Visiting the Abbey Church of St Peter's in Westminster was one of those experiences that brought together a life's worth of images and sounds into the sharply focussed world of reality. I have seen images of Westminster all through my life via TV - royal weddings and funerals, the papal visit of Benedict XVI etc - and I tried to put my preconceived ideas aside and experience the place for what it is. It was not that difficult as it turned out.The first experience was that common feeling that the place was not as big as it had loomed in my imagination. The Abbey is not a small place, but it is not an overwhelming one either. It has very human dimensions. I'd stood outside in the early evening and walked around the West Door and along the north side to the Lady Chapel (Henry VII's stunning addition). The following day I joined London Walks on their guided tour of the Abbey. Why? I have read a lot of the history of the Abbey over the years, but I wanted to ensure that I got a wholistic approach and having enjoyed London Walks \"Jack the Ripper\" walk and been impressed with the expertise of Molly and Donald, I thought the Abbey walk would be of a similar quality. And so it was. Federa was my guide and she ably steered our group through the cloisters and the West End through the Church and in and out of the maze of monuments and memorials.Our introduction to the Abbey was rather long, but necessary to establish the context of the building and its purpose. St Peter's was founded as a Benedictine monastic house; it was never a diocesan church and the church itself was a monastic place of worship for over 500 years before the reforms of Henry VIII and all the reforms that followed him.The shrine of St Edward the Confessor surrounded by the tombs of many of the medieval monarchs was a major highlight as was the simply magnificent Lady Chapel of Henry VII that left me speechless. It is great that there is mirror placed in the centre of the chapel so you don't strain your neck looking upwards at the fan vaulting.Much of the sanctuary and choir (spelled \"quire\") is 19th century refurbishment but there is enough remnant material from the monastic church to get some impression of what the Abbey may have looked like. There are two wall paintings of St Thomas and the Risen Christ and St Christopher that survived the iconoclasm of the 16th and 17th centuries because they were hidden behind a memorial and there are the recovered and restored panels of the Revelation of St John in the Chapter House.On the hour one of the Abbey priests asks everyone to be still for a minute's silence for prayer or reflection, a gentle reminder that we are in a \"working\" church.I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. Federa was an excellent guide and answered my many questions with enthusiasm and a pride in this wonderful building. I know that many people find the entry price rather steep, but since the Abbey enjoys no government or church funding, it depends entirely on revenues it raises on its own. I would have loved to take my own photos inside, but I respect the need to raise funds through whatever means possible. That said, the gift shop could do a little more in creating a suitable selection of books on the history of the Abbey. Perhaps they were sold out, but I only saw a \"coffee table\" book of the Chapter House - beautiful, but not what I was looking for.Before you leave, make sure you take in the Abbey museum, the Chapter House and if possible, the smaller cloister.So, to use the words of Psalm 122 and the memory of Parry's great anthem so often heard in the Abbey, \"I was glad when they said unto me, 'Let us go into the house of the Lord'\"."

This was an attraction that we missed out on during our first trip to London so it was at the top of the list for us to visit. This is one of the most magnificent architectural buildings around. Definitely worth the visit to see the stone work.The crowds were pretty thick though and a majority of my fellow tourists were quite rude and only concerned with what they were going to see and not caring what others might be trying to see. It also seems that over the years, the tourism has taken its toll. There are \"grave markers\" of a sort in the floor throughout the Abbey but many are worn away to a point that they are unreadable due to high volume of foot traffic. I went into this attraction expecting it to be somewhat quiet and reverent seeing that it is a church where services are still held, but that couldn't have been further from the truth. The majority of visitors seem to be noisy and uncaring of the fact that they are in a church. I suppose this isn't so much a drawback of the attraction as it is a simple disappointment in the people that visit it.I would definitely recommend this place even for the price. It is well worth it to try and find a time where the crowds are smaller and you can enjoy the Abbey and its rich history at a more leisurely pace."

This is definitely not the place for small children, as they are strict with the volume level of everyone in the Abbey. Also, because it is an active church, there are services sometimes occurring during your visit- definitely not the place for children under 12. Overall, the experience was amazing. The beauty of Westminster is unrivaled by any other cathedral or church I have been in. A definite must see!"

I recommend that you take the audio tour to give yourself some info of the background to the Abbey. Don't forget to look for Newton, Joule, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. However the tombs and memorials of the kings are much more intricate and amazing. The interior is absolutely majestic. It's pretty dark so watch your step and it could be quite crowded sometimes and so you will need to keep moving when in tight spaces and there aren't any shortages of those."

It is one of the UK's biggest symbols, and a place visited by millions of people from across the globe. Many famous people are buried there, from Kings and Queens of England, to famous writers, soldiers, artists and politicians. It should be a place you leave feeling inspired. But I left feeling dejected. It is nothing more than a commercial enterprise, but the authorities don't really want you there, they just want your money. You have to follow a one way system around the Abbey, there's no scope for casual wandering. Many areas are fenced off and off-limits to the general public. You can look, but please wipe your feet and don't linger too long is the message Westminster Abbey's authorities give out. I even had my sandwiches examined by an over officious security guard before I was allowed to enter.The Abbey could also do with a good scrub. One of England's most sacred sites, yet all those find tombs and plagues are covered in dust and grime. All the money the Church of England rakes in for the Abbey, yet they can't be bothered to send a few people around with dusters. It felt like nothing more than a commercial exercise, to allow the \"little people\" in to view their heritage, but not to allow them to fully appreciate it as they might want to aspire to be something better.The building a one of the most beautiful I have ever seen, and their are some magnificent pieces of artwork inside. But where St Paul's Cathedral gets it right, by having a clean, welcoming building, Westminster Abbey gets it very wrong by having a dirty, overly commercial unwelcoming attraction. They should remember that it is a place of worship, and that means being welcoming to all visitors, not just the \"chosen ones\" who can have full access to the whole of the Abbey.I'm actually quite sad that I have been so disappointed by my visit there. Westminster Abbey is always somewhere I have wanted to go, but it was a real let down."

Packed full of art, sculptures, tombs, and history, this abbey really gives you a feeling of spiritual presence. Even if you aren't a religious person and don't really enjoy visiting religious sites, this is one place you really shouldn't pass up. I went with my girlfriend at evensong (check the times, I think 4 or 5pm), and entrance is free if you go at that time. The short service was nice and the interior is beautiful. The only downside for some is there is no photography but in my opinion, this really helps preserve the appropriate atmosphere inside as opposed to Notre Dame in Paris and many others that are swarmed with tourists. I highly recommend taking a few hours to visit this spectacular place."

Be aware that you are attending a religious service, so the appropriate decorum is expected and you must be there in advance of the beginning of the service; you can't just stroll in.

The self guided tour is well worth the 16 pounds spent - the audio was great - and very informative. In addition 'volunteers' were available to assist as needed - we took advantage of this and they were knowledgeable and extremely helpful. One lady in particular shared some insight on the handling of the bouquet after the Royal Wedding a couple of years ago - a nice 'insider touch' she told us the relevance of the flowers used in the bouquet - simple and thoughtful. This is a piece of living history that touches all - those with ancestors from the UK as well as those who enjoy learning more about the lives and resting place of artists, writers and poets. Living in Chatham County in North Carolina I was particularly interested in the memorial to William Pitt - Earl of Chatham - who is still reflected in the name of the County.Plan to spend several hours visiting so that no detail is missed - it is time well spent"

Our first full day in London, we got on the tube by our flat and took it down to the Parliament buildings (came out right underneath Big Ben), and walked around the corner to Westminster Abbey. We knew we wanted to go to Westminster Abbey, although I really had no idea what it was like in there except for pictures of royal weddings. We spent quite a long time in there. It is really fascinating, although it was frustrating not to be able to take pictures. I highly recommend the free audio tour, because you can use it any time you come across something you are wondering about, but you can go at your own pace. I had to keep going back for my husband because he wanted to look at every single sculpture and was taking a very long time. It is an absolutely fascinating place, I highly recommend it - one of the best things we did in London."

Not only did I get \"massive church\" and \"weird Christian tidbits\" but crazy amounts of stories of lots of dead people - royals, celebrities, writers, actors, randoms and even cats. The place is huge and you'll be slowed down reading about all the interesting people and their ensuing demise. The architecture is magnificent and makes you wonder how people back in the day could be so creative and why our buildings and churches today look so incredibly drab. It was very cool to attend the small services they had - an experience that in and of itself isn't going to blow your spiritual mind, but something you shouldn't miss nonetheless. Even if you're not churchy or care about that side of things, it has enough to keep even little ones interested (meaning that YOU should be interested too). My only comment - there's like 2 restaurants anywhere within walking distance of this place, so don't come hungry and hope to find someone nearby!"

My favourite areas were the tomb of Elizabeth 1 and the Lady Chapel. My husband was fortunate enough to be able to enter the Shrine of Edward the Confessor - access to this only occurs during prayer times due to the delicate nature of the Shrine. The cafe \"Cellarium\" is well worth a visit - very fresh tasty food, great service, and (for London) unbelievably low prices."

Buy it online and save and then you can skip some lines and end up saving lots of money.I'll also add that I thought this gift shop was one of the better ones at the major London attractions. Usually a line on the main floor to check out--go to the back of the store and down a few short stairs. Mainly jewelry downstairs, but there is another register that had no line!"

There were about 30 people in the line in front of me and it took me about 15 minutes to get in. Your ticket for admission includes a free audio guide. There is more than enough information in the audio guide and with things to see and pore over in the Abbey to last a good hour. I took almost 2 hours. Two highlights of the tour are the Lady Chapel and the history of English Coronation. The fact that I have a great deal of respect for Jeremy Irons' work only made the tour all that more special for me, he is the narrator in the audio guide, you see. I would encourage you not to hurry through this tour, this will allow you to soak in the splendor and quiet majesty of the Abbey. You will also begin to appreciate the fact that this place of worship has been in existence for centuries and continues to be an active, living and breathing sanctuary, it is not some theme park re-creation, but a real place where you can have a real encounter with history. Sir Isaac Newton is buried here. This is entirely amazing to me, and if this fact amazes you too, then you should definitely visit.To end on a more practical note. Some of the more interesting spots at Westminster don't appear to be wheelchair-ready. Please be sure to inquire before visiting if wheelchair access is required."

My family and I visited Westminster Abbey for the first time on Sunday morning, attending Matins.Unfortunately we got held up in traffic diversions and arrived at 10.15, so we had to sit in the Nave. Though sad to have arrived late and not be able to sit beyond the Quire, we very much enjoyed the last half hour of the service.However, the moment service finished - as the organ voluntary started, an usher asked everyone to start leaving. I took the opportunity to admire the stained glass windows and read the tombs around the side of the Nave. Whilst doing this I was asked by another usher to leave.While I was near the door a third usher even went as far as to touch my arm to guide me faster out of the door. All of this during the organ voluntary.One doesn't like to make a fuss in such a situation, but once outside the door I did make a comment to the final usher about being hurried out when the voluntary was still being played. At that moment the playing finished, and with what I can only describe as an insolent smirk the usher said 'well it's finished now', as he shut the door in my face.I appreciate that there is a further service at 11.15, but there was fully 25-30 minutes before that began. So there was no need to harry people out of the Nave.The whole experience was quite extraordinary: disrespectful, insensitive and to be blunt, very rude. And above all unworshipful."

We (my wife and two other couples) went on a Thursday afternoon in September and did not wait at all to get in. This is my second visit to the Abbey and I did not wait the first time either (although I heard the line is long during peak times).  I am a history buff and did not visit the Abbey on my first couple of London visits as I thought it was just another old church. I could not have been more wrong. Westminster Abbey is an amazing place with an incredible history. Not only is it a large church but it is also the place of King and Queen Coronations and royal weddings and royal burials. On my first visit I paid for the audio guide tour so wanted to do a Verger led tour this time but these tours were not operating for some reason. I tried to call a week ahead and reserve a spot on a Verger tour but they only accept reservations the day before (since they do not always know in advance if the tours will be operating.) I was hoping to go on this tour as you get into some areas of the Abbey where the audio tour does not. We settled on the audio guide tour and still had a great time. The audio guide tour can be a little confusing as there are so many nooks and crannies in the Abbey that I was not always sure if I was supposed to takle an immediate left or right, or walk a few yards further and then turn (but I made it through).I really enjoyed everything but really enjoyed the medieval wooden coronation chair. All monarchs since about 1300 have been crowned on this chair except Queen Mary I. The chair was very interesting as it appeared to have graffiti on it (it\u2019s amazing a wood chair survived this long). I also enjoyed King Henry VII\u2019s chapel and the Poets Corner. Not only is King Henry VII and his wife buried in the chapel but so are his famous granddaughters Queens Elizabeth and Mary Tudor. In addition, most if the other Tudors are buried here. The Poets Corner is amazing as many famous people are buried in this area including Charles Dickens, Chaucer, composer Handel, Rudyard Kipling, actor Laurence Olivier, and poet Alfred \u201cCharge of the Light Brigade\u201d Tennyson.Westminster Abbey is amazing and is truly one of the must see attractions in London (especially if you are a history buff)."

You want seats right in front, preferably on the south side---that way you can still see the choir and also you can see the priest when he preaches and the officiator when he sings and conducts the service.The service lasts less than 1 hour.

I am probably the furthest thing from an Anglophile you can imagine, but this review may give you cause to doubt it.It was the day after the 2012 Olympics opened in London. We arrived in London exhausted, with a 13 hour stopover ahead of us. We took the pricey but excellent Heathrow Express in to Paddington and the Tube to Piccadilly. We surfaced in Trafalgar Square and over the course of an alternately rainy and sunny afternoon, made our way towards Westminster. The Abbey was closed but a notice on the gate mentioned that the choral evensong service (it was a Sunday) would begin at at 3 pm. Worshippers were invited to attend minus cameras. I am so glad we did. What a joy to enter this exquisite gothic structure, to sit in the choir, to immerse oneself in a harmonious swell of superb polyphony, ancient and modern. The acoustics were extraordinary. Around us a few Olympians had filtered in - their team colours showed they were from Poland and Canada \u2013 and they listened raptly as they prepared themselves for the great contest ahead. The very reverend John Hall, Dean of Westminster delivered the readings of scripture and verse in perfectly modulated tones. The choral responses soared. The lady bishop of Wimbledon gave the homily - a fact that pleased our feminist Catholic teenagers (and us) greatly. I was startled \u2013 despite my own Catholic traditions \u2013 by the extent of pomp and circumstance in a high Anglican service. After an hour, we filed out and strolled over to the Thames, rested and refreshed, physically and spiritually."

The staff was very friendly and helpful. We liked the audio guides and thought they were very helpful, though a bit confusing at times. I particularly liked the fact that pictures aren't allowed inside - it maintains the reverence the place demands. Also every hour a prayer is offered inside the church, and the bishop (?) calls everyone to either join in or at least be silent in reverence while he offers a very brief prayer. I loved being able to pray in that place. It's a beautiful, amazing place.We did not eat there so I can't say anything about the restaurant."

Spend the money -- take this tour! The tour guides are members of the Abbey staff. They are called Vergens and are lay people, they are dressed in long black cassocks, so they look sort of priest-ly. They can take you to places inside the Abbey you cannot go with the audioguide. We went into the center of the Abbey, through a gate, up some creaky stairs and heard the story of Edward the Confessor, who began the building of this magnificent building in 1053 (or thereabouts). There is a tomb that you can kneel in; all very ancient and sacred feeling. The story of why Elizabeth 1 and Mary are buried together is fascinating. The history is so dense that without a guide, it would all be overwhelming. The line to get in was divided; one side for cash and one side for credit. The guide books say that you can only pay cash, so the credit might be new, but there was no wait at all on that side. The line to pay cash was LOONNNGGGGGG. And the tour is limited to about 20. At some point, the gentleman counted and discovered he had picked up a couple of strays. Even though we were wearing badges, identifying us a members of a tour, some people just joined us! He asked them, in the politest way possible, to leave our tour, as he could only accommodate 20. Very nice. He explained everything, took us everywhere; might have been the best tour in London, and that is saying a lot! He invited us to return for an Evensong service, to hear the choir sing. I did. What a wonderful experience. The building has great acoustics and there isn't anything more moving than a boy's choir in a stone building! I cannot thank the Abbey staff enough for this wonderful experience."

It's incredible. It's expensive, but it's easily possible to spend two or three hours inside. The museum is a highlight - coming face to face with Henry VII was really something, and seeing the ring that Elizabeth I had given to Essex... a token of her favour, carved with her image ..... There are some cons though. It's busy, and 'the tour' is regimented. It's not possible to wander around at will, areas are roped off and the audio guide (included in the entrance fee) encourages the visitor to keep moving; the guide is good in as far as it goes - history in broad strokes - it concentrates on a few highlights and is far from comprehensive. Although Abbey staff were helpful when I asked questions, the experience seemed to be designed to get people round as quickly as possible. We wanted to have lunch in the Cellarium Cafe before starting our visit, little realising that having queued for our audio guides we could not take them into the cafe area. The Cellarium was expensive, service was a little abrupt, and the discretionary service charge was added to the bill without comment or explanation."

The lineup to get in was long, but we chose the cash-only line, which moved quickly. Despite the crowds, it was tranquil and peaceful, and we spent much longer there than we expected. We learned a fair bit about the history of the British royal family and mainstream religious life in England. We also enjoyed a private meditation service in King Edward the Confessor's shrine and tomb, surrounded by kings and queens. This is offered twice a day and it is the only opportunity for visitors to visit the shrine. A great deal of time can be spent seeking out the resting places of luminaries such as Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, George Frederic Handel and Laurence Olivier. Many of the more recognizable names can be found in Poet\u2019s Corner, which is at the end of the tour route. Admission is definitely costly, but it includes a detailed audio and video guide narrated by actor Jeremy Irons. There is a treasure hunt booklet for families to use to make the experience more exciting and educational for kids. Be sure to visit the Chapter House, full of beautiful stained glass, wall paintings, and the oldest door in Britain."

Entrance is by the north door, (if you chose to pay with a credit card the queue is on the right and is longer / slower than the cash queue on the left). There is an audio guide included in the charge, but for a little extra a personal guided tour by one of the abbey guides is best, especially if you seek those little gems that bring the whole place alive.The delicate tomb of Edward The Confessor (whose death lead indirectly to the Norman Invasion) maybe glimpsed, but is strictly controlled by prior arrangement.....definitely worth doing your research beforehand as it can be overwhelming. The buiulding and its adjoing cloisters and chapter house are truly wonderful, the stone work in particular is jaw dropping....then there is the whose who of who is there, out of over 3,000 dead candidates I chose Richard III wife Anne Neville who is remebered on the opposite side to Henry VII, Elizabeth and Mary Tudor, daughters of Henry VIII and Queens of England in turn but bitterly opposed on religious lines, they are buried side by side, not far from Mary Queen of Scots who was executed for treason after the discovery of the Babington plot.....Henry VII is there and so are plaques to soldiers prime ministers, poets etc., Cromwell was here until Charles II was so outraged that he had him dug up and hanged and beheaded (although already dead!) at Tyburn.....I wonder if there were any Irish volunteers for that task.... The abbey (which is not an abbey any more c/o Henry VIII) is generally open to visitors Monday to Friday, but check because it maybe closed for religious services. I am told that Mondays are notoriously busy because of build-up over the weekend. There were some building works when I was there but these were not very intrusive..... Is the entrance fee too expensive? Maybe to some but it rather depends how much you get out of your trip; good planning and prep will probably enhance your experience and value for money......"

I cannot tell you how much I was looking forward to visiting Westminster Abby. We arrived 15 mins before opening on a Wednesday morning and lined up in a small que about 10 people long. At 10am the Abby opened and we were shuffled into the ticket line. The price per ticket is 19 pounds and that comes with an included audio guide. We wanted to take the guided tour with a real person but were told that it is an extra 5 pounds a person and the first tour of the day was totally booked. We decided to just do the audio tour which was one of those phone type things where you type in the number when you get to it and then hold it to your ear. That were fine and the guy giving them out was helpful in pointing us in the right direction to start. I enjoyed the information and found it easy to use but because everyone is forced to travel the same direction in an odd sort of parade spaces around the numbers got really cramped. Lots of school groups were there and people began to really pack in a jostle for spots to see the alter and graves of monarchs. At two different points school groups pushed past my husband and I and stood in front of graves to listen as one big group. We are both in are twenties physical fit and don\u2019t mind crowds but found this crazy and very uncomfortable. After we finished the tour and walked through the outer gate to tour the grounds and gardens we were astounded by the huge numbers of people, tour groups and school groups who seemed to show up out of nowhere. They all seemed to be on their own private tours and were happy to push past independent travelers and cut lines to see the highlights of the Abby. What truly annoyed me was that the docents who are stationed everywhere did not seem to mind and when we asked them about it told us that the groups are such big ticket buyers they are accommodated. The Abby however is amazing the architecture is breathtaking and the small museum in the west crypt is very cool and has 6 or 7 wax effigies preserved from royal funerals of the 1800\u2019s. The audio tour is average and provides good information but is rigidly laid out and in large crowds hard to follow. The docents are around at lots of peak locations and were very nice about answering questions or helping find a specific grave/monument. Overall I went to London really looking forward to visiting Westminster Abby and left with the feeling that; if you have time go, Its gorgeous and historic but if your only in England for a short time we found other churches more beautiful, less crowed and much friendlier even if less famous and with less buried monarchs."

After 4 weeks in France and Spain visiting churches that don't charge for entry, I thought the 16 pound entry fee per adult was ridiculous. Even with the sign outside the front that attempts to explain that the state, crown or government does not fund the abbey - I thought asking people to cough up that kind of money to get in was very steep indeed...so I did not go in. If you're happy to view from the outside though, it's good enough!"

We attended the 5pm Evensong service and were lucky enough to get to sit in the choir stalls! The choir was just out of this world, we were so pleased to be able to attend this service and thank God for a great and safe vacation. It was St. Luke's day and the bells were rung after the service which was so wonderful to experience."

However, it was worth the cost to me to be able to fast track past the lines with the pass so recommend purchasing one if you don't like to wait in long lines. The Abbey doesn't allow photography and the staff will tell you to mind your bags due to pickpockets. There is a handheld tour device that you hold up to your ear to hear the stories of each area. They move you through the church at a nice even pace which allows you to see all you wish to see. Warning the Abbey is rather large and it is difficult to absorb it all in a few hours. The Coronation chair is there to view as well but is tucked in a corner so don't miss seeing where all the Kings and Queens were crowned."

If you don't go in, you are missing out on 90% of the experience of Westminster Abbey, even if there is a queue. Absolutely, go early, but they let a lot of people in at a time. So, even if there is a queue, you'll get in. Nothing can describe the history of the place and of all the people buried there. You have to go in. It is simply one of the \"must see's\" of London. You'll understand what I am saying after you've made the tour. Note: It's better than St. Paul's. As good as St. Paul's is, this is better. And it's a holy place too. Every hour on the hour, everyone in the building is asked to stop in their tracks and remain quiet while a one minute prayer is read over the address system from the pulpit. That's very neat."

My kids loved this place, we loved this place. It was beautiful and well worth the cost of admission. If you have questions, be sure to ask the many people stationed around the church.

We also enjoyed poets' corner and were amazed by the number of British authors that are buried or memorialized in it. We were stunned by the plethora of graves and memorials--it would take many viisits to fully appreciate this aspect.Our first attempt to visit the Abbey failed as there was a special event taking place. However we learned that the website lists the events to which the pubic can get passes. The benefit of this is hearing the choir sing.

You can actually feel the history of Westminster Abbey as you step inside. It's fun to get lost in the imagery of the stories of the artists, royalty, poets and writers. While it is certainly a typical tourist stop, it should be on your \"don't miss\" list along with St. Paul's which is entirely different and stunningly magnificent. The Evensong service at 5 pm is lovely - particularly if you get to hear the Abbey boys' choir. We ended up with a seat in the back with no view.

We went with the Verger Tour and as far as I am concerned it was the only way to go, extra 3.00 pounds. They got you close to all the different areas and gave a little more information than the audio guide did. Unfortunately the area behind the altar was closed because of restoration work but we had a quick peek. I had a tear in my eye when I saw Elizabeth 1st crypt. The history, the people buried and remembered there is truly overwhelming, I loved the quire area and where the Knight of the Bath sit. Because this is a working church no photos, no cell phones and every hour a prayer is said. It was nice to see people of all faiths stop and take a moment to respect this. The tour takes about 90 minutes and then we went back to some of the areas to revisit. In total we spent about 3 hours there and we would definitely go back if we go to London again.

The burial chambers are amazing, but as a friend of mine remarked, if you want to see where Henry VIII is buried, it's not here...in case you want to see him, he's elsewhere.The poets and writers are everywhere, please don't stand on them! It's just marvellous to stand where kings have stood and look at the amazing old architecture. Today's designers could learn something about durability!Like entering a sacred place, which, of course, it is!"

The line for credit moved swiftly, there were probably 100 people ahead of us, and only a 10-15 minute wait. The free audio guide was quite handy, and doesn't give lectures, just quick explanations of what you're looking at. Sadly you can't take pictures in here, but that's too be expected in any setting such as this."

I also had to use the restroom after waiting in a very long line to get in and the restrooms are all the way at the end of the tour and since the whole place is roped off so that people follow it in order, I was forced to speed walk the whole thing first and then go all the way back through to the beginning which was time consuming and difficult with the amount of people there."

Even the most jaded will be amazed and will love the sheer grandeur and elegance of this place. It is really nothing short of amazing. I can honestly say that I love The Abbey, and it is really something that you have to see when you\u2019re in London. It will take you some time to go through this wonderful place. Primarily because The Abbey is much larger than one would think. The main hall is immense, and the outer courts are expansive. There is just so much to see. Also, nearly everyone who is anyone is buried there. The tombs are fascinating to see, and the details provided in the audio tour warrant you taking your time. The outside corridors surrounding the square is quite nice (and there are even tons of people buried there, also), and it\u2019s an area where you can get something to eat and relax and also take some pictures. In closing, The Abbey embodies so much of British history, yet is a living place in that it is a working church and remains an important part of state functions today. With that in mind it would be a mistake to travel all the way to London and not see this magnificent place. Just go, and I promise you that you\u2019ll be blown away!Hope this helps."

I had been looking forward to a trip to Westminster Abbey ever since my husband and I planned out our itinerary for our trip to London as neither of us had visited the Abbey before. I was sadly, and extremely, disappointed by the whole visit. It made me feel depressed.An air of \"we don't want you in here\" pervades the whole place. The staff are rude, unwelcoming and the entire staff body wandering round the building are unhelpful and unapproachable (which is odd considering all they seem to be doing is walking in circles doing nothing) and their attitude was distinctly of the variety that 'we're better than you little people and it's only because we have to let you in here that you are'.The whole place is dirty, the statues, plaques and plinths don't look like they've been cleaned in a long time (baring a very quick spruce up for the royal wedding) and there are cobwebs coming off of them. What exactly are the people running Westminster Abbey spending all their profits on? It's clearly not on conservation and cleaning! The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was poignant and probably the only thing I can't fault.One of the jewels in Westminster Abbey is supposed to be the tombs of the monarchs they have buried there (such as Richard II, Henry V and Edward VI amongst others) but you only get to see a small part of each tomb because the rest is facing the shrine of Edward the Confessor. As for looking at the shrine of Edward the Confessor, a major religious pilgrimage for many people and an important historical pilgrimage for others, forget it. It's reserved for the privileged few and only open at certain, limited, times (to be slightly fair; I've since learned that the shrine is closed off so much at the moment because of work being done to the flooring around it but I could find no information about this while on my visit. I had to look at their website to find it out). What little joy I did get out of this place came from looking at the tombs of Queens Elizabeth and Mary something I've always wanted to do but even this was ruined by the high dirty metal railings surrounding it and it was really obscured. Also you don't get a long to look at anything in this building as there's too many other people around and as everyone's walking round the set out route from the guide book (and don't try and deviate from the given route as you'll get dirty looks from the staff!) you kind of get shoved along anyway.Poets corner was a little better but even that didn't exactly overjoy me as by the time I reached it I was so disheartened by the rest of the building. I also got the feeling it was overly crammed, haphazardly designed and generally disorganised. What a shame.We got in using our London Pass so thankfully didn't have to pay the extortionate \u00a316 per adult entry fee. I won't be visiting again until major changes have taken place. The people running this place should be deeply ashamed and all the staff should all be retrained. Appalling."

This being one of several holy places we had been to during our holiday it did get a bit weird that people were buried in them. I'm used to graveyards being outside and (I'm not trying to be disrespectful mentioning this) I found it hard to see how people could be respectful when most of the time you had to walk over the sites.

At the top of my list of course was the Tower of London. Overall, London is VERY easy to get around via both the bus and metro. Although you will see much more of London if you take the bus, traffic can also be very congested, so for me my preference was to take the Metro. Public transportation in and around London is safe, efficient, easy and cheap.Having said all that. Westminster Abbey is right in the heart of London - across from Big Ben and Parliament and from what I recall in walking distance to the Churchill War Rooms, Downing Street, etc. Of all the sites I visited in London, I think this was perhaps my favorite. Westminster Abbey is just an architectural marvel - both from the outside and the inside. Its rather large, with so many different rooms to explore. Personally speaking, I love history - especially British history - and it was just such a cool experience to stand a few feet away from the tomb of Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary. There's quite a bit to see and well worth giving yourself every bit of 2 hours to explore. I really can't stress enough how much I enjoyed Westminster AbbeyDepending on the amount of time you have in London, it might not be a bad idea to get the London Pass. If you are staying 3-5 days, the pass becomes much more economical and essentially grants you 'free' pass to almost all attractions in London. Place your order for the London pass before you go and you will be able to either pick it up right there in central London or possibly have it mailed to you. It saved me quite a bit of money on the trip. You can find it quite easily with a google search. Also, buy a day or week pass to the metro - it covers both buses and the underground, and is fairly inexpensive. I was able to take the metro from the airport to the hotel. Cost me about 8 euro (for a day pass). The business associate I met up with at the hotel got a taxi from the airport. He spent 65 euro and it took him roughly the same amount of time to get to the hotel as it took me. Just some food for thought. They have an excellent (and safe) public transportation system."

I\u2019m sure they are aware many attend service just so they don\u2019t have to pay to see the inside. Hearing the choir with the acoustics of the church was amazing. There are no photos allowed. Maybe it is different for paying visitors that are not there for service, I\u2019m not sure. After service, they are quick to usher you out. I would go back to see St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral before I would see Abbey again, personal opinion."

As one writer mentioned check which line you should be on, there are two, one for cash and one for credit payment. The signs are near the door so you have to walk up first to see which line then walk back to join the queue. We had the audio guide and a map and I found this a good way to understand what you were looking at. It would also have been good to take the guided tour, although I dont think I fully was aware of this option at the time, and realised it later on. If I went again I would do the guided tour. I found it a fabulous place full of history, with its own special feeling. It wasn't too crowded when we were there, I mean it wasn't unbearably crowded. Dont miss going around the corner after you've finished viewing the Abbey to see the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and Westminster Bridge."

Everywhere you turn is yet another tomb or shrine of some extraordinary political, scientific, cultural or artistic legend. There are historical gems and revelations hidden and tucked away in every nook and cranny. The architecture and art is beautiful and inspiring but you don't get that sense of sacred space that other houses of worship evoke - however you do get a strong sense of walking on historical hallowed ground. Of course it is extremely crowded and you feel you are being hoarded through a tourist trap but that is to be expected. It is easy to overlook this and get lost in the ambiance."

It's a few extra pounds, but very reasonable because you get to go in spots you can only see while accompanied by a verger. The place is definitely crowded, and do keep in mind it's a place of worship. They do stop for prayer for a moment every hour, and it's respectful to stand quietly during that moment. A helpful hint - when you approach the building, come up in front of the main entrance and make note which line you need to be in - cash or credit card (there is a sign right in front of the door).

The audio supplement is invaluable (despite the cheesy super-british accent). Once through the abbey, the Churchill war rooms, Big Ben, and the London Eye are all nearby and a short walk. It's easy to do them all in one afternoon (buy tickets in advance to avoid some of the lines), and finish with the London Eye - the kpmg transit boat dock is next to the Eye and a trip down the Thames costs about 6EU to Greenwich where you can hop on the blue line DLR that goes through Canary Wharf and brings you back into central London (Bank tube station)"

You arent allowed ro take pictures though. We were given free audio guides which were ok, and the children were given quizzes to complete. To be honest I think that they ought to manage the numbers allowed in at one time as in some places it was ridiculous, we could barely move and definitely couldn't see! Other areas were less packed but very noisy! The children couldn't do a lot of the quiz as they couldn't get near the areas to find the relevant information. Once the abbey itself had been seen we went into chapter house and the pyx chambers.... For some reason these were much quieter and well worth visiting. We all found the atmosphere there to be very peaceful and you can tell the area is steeped in history. I felt that a lot of the areas should have had some signage as at times it was too noisy to hear the audio guides.

My young son (7) did the audio tour along with the kids' scavenger hunt and really enjoyed it. It got him moving through the abbey to actually find specific things, not just wander around like we old people enjoy doing. :) Of course I'm disappointed that photography is not permitted, but that's a small price to pay for having the opportunity to visit one of the world's greatest testimonies to important figures of our collective, human past. Poet's Corner was my favorite section, but simply noticing the scores of stone tomb faces you walk on throughout the entire grounds is incredible in itself.

I'm a history buff so I found the final resting place of many of England's royal family to be naturally interesting. The architecture is absolutely spectacular and don't forget to see King Edward's Chair on which every King (and Queen) of England has been crowned since the 1300's (and which contained the Stone of Scone). It's small, wooden and has been carved up/graffitied by what looks to be an assortment of medieval society (which I think adds to it's charm - if you were expecting something more regal, though, try not to be too disappointed). The one major issue I take with the Abbey is the cost of admission. In every church in Europe, it's free to enter. Not in England, however. To visit the Abbey (and St Paul's Cathedral) will put a serious dent in your tourist purse. I understand the Abbey would require money to run and therefore funding is necessary, I'm just not sure ripping off tourists to the tune of \u00a316 each is the nicest way to do it. But, it IS worth seeing - even with the steep entry fee."

Yes, they do charge admission to a church -- but the clergyman we talked to explained that the Abbey gets no funding from the Church of England (since they view it as a historical building) and no funding from the British government (since they view it as a church). That's also the reason for the \"no photos\" rule -- they want you to buy postcards. However, we found no one stopping us from taking a few shots esp of things for which there are no postcards. Well worth the visit, with all of British history jumbled before you. Even our teenagers, who were skeptical and initially wanted to pop their heads in and then leave for someplace with wifi, were fascinated. We spent about an hour and a half there, far longer than we expected. Highlights for us were Elizabeth I's grave, where we noticed that she was proclaimed (in Latin) the queen of England, France, and Spain; the sheer wealth of talent in Poet's Corner (plus noticing that Christopher Marlowe's death date, on the stained glass window, has a question mark after it); the moving inscription on David Livingstone's grave; and the tomb of the unknown soldier. Unlike so many outer churches, there are plenty of clergy and volunteers around to explain what you're seeing and tell stories, and we found them well worth chatting with. Definitely a must-see."

Since virtually all other famous churches in Europe (like Notre Dame or the Vatican) are free, this initially put me off. But since I was really interested, I paid and was glad I did. We visited on a Tuesday morning in late June and didn't experience long lines or large crowds. Employees were polite to me. I loved the audio guide, it was truly excellent. It allowed me to tour the cathedral at my own pace and sit down at times while listening to the explanations. The cathedral was well worth the visit, I especially enjoyed the ceiling in the lady's chapel and the various tombs, both of famous and ordinary people. Some of the famous people buried here are many of the kings and queens of England (like Elizabeth I and her half-sister Mary and Mary, Queen of Scots) and composers, actors and poets. It was fun to see where the royal wedding took place and Elizabeth II was crowned--the chair used for crowning is also on display. My husband and teenage son chose not to take the tour. They came back later in the day (around 5pm I believe) and went to the evensong services. They were able to go into the church for free at that time and see the nave. However, visitors participating in the evensong services are not allowed to wander around the church during or after the service but are contained in one area."

Children can fill out a scavenger hunt activity (write down answers to questions throughout the abbey) and then hand it into the giftshop at the end. The reward is a large chocolate coin. Our kids really enjoyed this. They said it's for under 10s but quite honestly I can see up to 14 year olds enjoying it. The audio guides are free, and each member of your group can get one. You hand them in when you exit. I think they could be expanded to include all on the sights numbered in the Abbey. What was included in the audio tour was excellent and just enough to not be overwhelming. Must sees include Elizabeth I's grave as well as Newton's, Darwin's, burial sites as well as those buried in Poet's corner. There are 5 minute periods of silence throughout the day that visitors are requested to observe for prayer or reflection. Caps and hats must be removed in the Abbey. It's amazing when you realize that the Abbey was first built in 960. It was my son's number one place to visit and a definite highlight for all of us. My husband is not a history buff but he really enjoyed our visit. We did not do the Verger tour, but we were very happy with audio guides. I read in a previous review about someone mentioning about not being able to revisit places and everyone travelling the same direction. Yes there is only one exit, but you can revisit sights (we did) and you do not have to see the numbered sights in any particular order. You can stay as long as you want (until closing).Sandwich shop available in the Cloisters and you can take photos there but no other places other than outside."

We did ask one tour guide who was very helpful and friendly and a couple others who were a little pompous. There is so much to take in this place, no pictures allowed though, bummer. The fee is atrocious. I found it a shame that the church took advantage of that because like I said, we weren't allowed to use our London Pass which includes the Abbey visit. That was the only complaint and the no audio phone with tour included.

Awe inspiring is the ceiling of Henry VII Lady Chapel. This is an active church and services on Sunday's are open to the public.

There is a cash line which is shorter and a credit entrance line. A free audo-guide (several languages) comes with the tour which is narrated by Jeremy Irons. They have a nice kids self tour with parent accompaniment. Kids get a tour guide paper at the entrance. They fill it out as you listen to the audio tour. Once filled out the kids get a large chocolate gold coin.

(If you get two wishes, add the Tower of London.)It's a bit intimidating from the outside given the long lines and expensive enterance fee (I think it's 16GBP), but do it. As other reviewers have said, it's much more of a tour through the entire history of England than just a church. You'll be amazed how many of the graves you recognize, even if you slept through high school social science class. Allow plenty of time for this breathtaking experience.Currently there's a great photo exhibit of The Queen and Her Abbey near the end of the tour. Check it out to see the Royal Family in all the places you just stood!We recently returned to Westminster for Sunday Matins (10am Sunday). The choir gave me chills for a solid hour, and the serman was one of the best I've heard in a while. Enterance for worship is free of charge but you don't get to see nearly as much of the Abbey as if you visit on any other day and pay the enterance fee. Sundays are reserved for worship and not open for tourists, so check the website for times if you're interest in services.Nearest tube stop: Westminster. Walking distance to Big Ben, Parliament, London Eye, London Aquarium, Trafalgar Square"

We bypassed this last year in August because the lines were too long, but since we were in London during early July and rain, the crowds were thin. Tip* bring cash to bypass the credit card window...it is a lot faster. The audio guides are included in the price and are offered in multiple languages. It was hectic and confusing as there are so many people pressing against you. If possible, get a seat and get your bearings in order to plan the order of viewing. No photography was allowed. The number of crypts and artifacts is overwhelming. To do it justice, don't go with any cranky children or teenagers. Be prepared to enjoy this magnificent historical venue at a leisurely pace. Each corner and nave is crammed with history. Having watched the recent Royal wedding, it was difficult to envision it with so many people but I did gain a better appreciation for Westminster after seeing it up close and personal. Also, go as early as possible to avoid the crowds!"

The great thing about the Abbey is that it is virtually unchanged over hundreds of years, but they have changed one thing - they make you tour in a one way direction that is aggravating. When I visited in the 1980's, we walked in the front door and went in any direction we wanted. The one way tour was crowded and felt rushed. The audio guide is good, but the small museum would be better if it were larger and more modern with more artifacts with better labels and descriptions. That being said, it's a must see. I have stayed in the Abbey dorm rooms for three weeks one summer over 20 years ago, so this is a very special place for me. I was surprised it was not more so for my grown kids on this trip, but I think it was because we were forced into the one way tour - we sort of went in one way and popped out another."

Each room is numbered to correspond with the device so visitors can meander at their own pace. Regular guided tours are also available.The Abby has a long and colorful history over the last thousand years as a living church. Each hour for a minute or so, everyone pauses to pray or reflect.

Seeing all the ornate grave markers and the resting places of so many famous royals, not to mention the famous poets and writers definitely inspores me. It is also very interesting that the Abbey is still a functioning place of worship and residence. To me the highlights were Poet's Corner, Mary and Elizabeth's tomb, Mary of Scot's Tomb, Longshank's Tomb and the Coronation Chair (sans Stone). The hours are a little bit cumbersome, and, as much as I loved Mr. Irons' audio guide, it didn't cover anything not in the main building, so gathering information in the pyx room or the chapterhouse is from reading signs only. It was also a shame that no pictures were allowed inside."

By a very, VERY serendipitous quirk of fate, the #24 bus disgorged me within spitting distance of the Abbey and I realized with disbelief that I could attend Evensong at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon. As a Roman Catholic, I am not familiar with the intricacies of the Anglican Church service minutiae, but OMG.There was a bit of a queue (I LOVE typing that word) to enter the Abbey, and one of the gentlemen (vicar? rector? usher?) was asking us queuers our purpose for being there. The camera-toting gal in front of me said \"to visit.\" He told her to \"visit\" on Monday, when she could snap pics to her heart's content. I told him I was there to worship and he let me pass. Camera Lady got smart fast said that was why she was there, too, so he grudgingly allowed her in, which was a HUGE mistake because she took flash photos in spite of being admonished and adding insult to injury LEFT THE SANCTUARY EARLY. I am kind of a \"lapsing Catholic, \" but I have never, EVER felt more like falling to my knees and crying \"Take me home, Jesus\" than I did at Evensong. The music was, for want of a better word, thrilling. Five of the choristers were leaving service and there was a tribute to them, which I felt privileged to witness.Besides an edifying and hilarious half-hour chat with a London cabbie, this was indubitably the highlight of my three days in London. By all means GO and for heaven's sake turn off your camera if you attend a service."

So having a couple of hours to kill in the area, I thought I would take the Verger's tour so often recommended by TA. What a fantastic couple of hours and what a magnificent building. Why is it only ranked 37 by TA? I'm flabbergasted! Over 1000 years of history, stunningly beautiful architecture (the gothic ceiling of the Lady Chapel nearly had me in tears) and monuments to people of significance to people from every corner of the world. Yes, it's quite expensive to get it, but this is part of our cultural heritage, we should all be prepared to contribute a bit if we wish to visit it and preserve it for future generations. But absolutely pay the extra \u00a33 for the Verger's tour - it really does help you understand the history of the abbey and the throngs of people seem less important. Our verger was a mine of information and made our tour very personal. He asked where we were all from and then found a monument related to each of our countries. I was most impressed. Thanks very much to TA for alerting me to the Verger's Tour, I learnt a great deal and was greatly entertained."

You aren't sure where to look first. The best thing to do is grab an automated tour device from the volunteers at the front of the church. Even with that the abbey is a little too busy to really enjoy it. I kind of felt like we were cattle being herded along. It would be nice to go back when it isn't so busy, although I'm not sure any such time exists. Worth a visit for sure, just be prepared for the crowds."

The queues outside can be very long. If they are, simply turn around and visit St Margaret's church for free and note the red leather covered doors for the members of parliament to access the church without being exposed to the electorate.

It's a 90-minute behind-the-scenes look at some of the places and stories that the general public aren't generally allowed to see and hear. We needed to get there early so we set out on foot because it's just down the street. A VERY easy walk from our hotel.A brilliant blue sky provided a very colorful backdrop to this striking ancient Abbey reportedly founded in the year 960. We stood in line and in awe at the magnificance of the buildings around us. Crowds were starting to gather as we were allowed in and purchased our audio tour. We didn't use the audio tour as much because the Verger tour was so good. But with Jeremy Irons doing the voice on the audio tour, it has to be one of the sexiest audio guides I've ever heard! LOLWe met our tour-guide, verger David Mott in his clergy robes, and our small group of about 15 was led to several special places throughout the large abbey and we were told some wonderful tid bits that others would have missed in their audio tours.Our group was taken behind the main alter into Edward the Confessor's Chapel. Around the year 1060, King Edward founded the church on this site. The Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor is the spiritual heart of the Abbey. Surrounding the shrine, which contains the saint's body, lie five kings and four queens.Hundreds, if not thousands, of famous politicians, royals, artisians, and spiritual leaders are buried or memorialized throughout the Abbey. One cannot help but step on memorials as they're laid out on the floor beneath you. Quite sad really. Apparently Winston Churchill refused to be buried there saying \"I've had people walk all over me in life, why have it done in death\".I've been readying a lot about the Tudor age with a particular interest in Queen Mary I and Queen Elizabeth I, King Henry VIII's oldest children. Both Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth are buried here at the Abbey in Henry VII's Lady Chapel built in 1516. Elizabeth's tomb is actually on TOP of Mary's, which is quite sad. But at the end of Mary's reign, she was known as \"Bloody Mary\" due to putting to death some 300 'heretics' who refused to recant their Protestant faith. I found Mary's life to be quite sad, and then to add insult to injury, her more famous sister is buried on top of her.On our tour, we were also allowed to sit in the roped-off Quire area. The Quire (choir) is a 'church wtihin a church' where we learned the history and symbolizm of each and every decorative element in the quire. Including where the current Queen Elizabeth II sits when she attends service there.At the end of our tour, we viewed the coronation chair, which has seen better days, but is the oldest piece of furniture in Britian still in use for its original purpose. Commissioned in 1297, the chair has been badly abused over the centuries and lost much of its original luster, but I'm glad they're not \"redoing\" it and leaving it. Yes, it's not pretty, but the history of that chair is highly significant.We wanted to stay at the Abbey all day. There is so much to see and so much history in these sacred walls that we just did not leave enough time to explore everything we wanted to. Our verge tour was wonderful and we highly recommend it."

This we felt was really worth the extra \u00a33. The Verger, Ben Shepherd (not the presenter!!!) was brilliant (a BIG thank you to him). He made some dry subjects and bits of information very enjoyable and in some cases comical. Make sure you ask about what happened to Oliver Cromwell!!

Westminster Abbey may be more than a thousand years of history enshrined in Gothic glory, but to visit it as merely another museum is to miss the point. It is first and foremost a church, so schedule your visit to coincide with one of the three services being held daily \u2013 Morning Prayer, Evensong, and the Eucharist \u2013 or those held on a Sunday.The latter is best as you get to enjoy the service without hundreds of tourists wandering about. Services on Sundays are free, and you enter by the main entrance (the side entrance used by tourists during the week is closed), but don\u2019t try and get in some sightseeing on the side. Rather come back another day and pay the admission fee.I attended Evensong (15:00 on a Sunday/weekdays at 17:00), which was held in the Quire, and was welcomed warmly in spite of being dressed rather informally. The service, sung by the Choir of St Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey, was a wonderful uplifting experience."

To stand in the place where so many coronations, funerals, weddings, etc. have taken place over hundreds of years was utterly amazing.We visited first thing in the morning and had no line to get in. It was fairly busy inside, but not overly crowded to where we felt pushed or rushed through at all. We spent roughly 2.5 hours going through and probably could have spent longer if we hadn't had other places to be in the afternoon.Included in the cost of entry was an audio guide, which was really informative. As others have said, the cost is a bit steep, but we used the London Pass to enter, so I feel like it didn't hit us as hard just how expensive it truly was. Regardless, it was well worth it, IMO."

We had visited St Paul's the day before and spent way longer than we intended to, so this time went expecting to take a minimum of 3 hours - and we needed every minute. The cost was \u00a332 for a family of 3, and it was definitely worth the cost. We visited in December so there were no queues for admission, although at some of the tombs we may have had to wait several minutes to take a look. The only drawback of a winter visit is that often you enter an attraction in daylight, and exit when it is dark; probably nothing out of the ordinary for Europeans, but for us from Australia, darkness at 3.30pm was so frustrating.Upon entry into the Abbey our son was given a questionnaire to be completed during our visit; it was so much fun! It kept him (and us) entertained for hours, searching for the tomb of this person or that one, counting knights, etc. At the end he was given a chocolate coin for his troubles - I think the fact that he was given something to do meant that he did not have a chance to become bored, and we were able to spend a little more time ourselves. It was just like stepping back into a school history lesson, seeing the tombs of so many famous historical figures. We loved being in Poet's corner, searching for monuments and memorials to famous authors, scholars, poets. It was so pretty walking outside into the cloisters, then back to explore the interior further.I would definitely recommend Westminster Abbey for a visit - and DO bring the kids, they will love it! You will be amazed how much they actually take in and learn - six months later our 11-year-old still has recall on a lot of the things he saw, heard about, read, etc."

The abbey has so many historic sights to offer apart from being a spiritual space.

It dates back to the 1200's and is surrounded by other kings of England that cannot be seen from the general public area.Another bonus of the tour is the chance to sit in the quire (pronounced choir) seats in front of the high alter and to walk right up pass the tourists to the high alter and get a good look at it.The tour takes about an hour and a half, and the guide was a bit stuffy, but all-in-all this was a fantastic experience."

He pointed out the spots on the high altar where the coronation chair (built around the coronation Stone of Destiny that has been returned to Edinburgh Castle) was placed and where Kate and William got married. We were let into the Chapel of St Edward the Confessor (where Kate and William signed the marriage registry). The Verger Tour greatly enhanced my visit to Westminster Abbey."

            "review": "Expensive, but Probably Worth It for British History Buffs. On my last visit to London, my son and I arrived too late to visit the abbey as a tourist, but we were admitted to the Evensong service. The few members of the public in attendence were seated behind the choir. While that's not a good way to \"visit\" the Abbey, it is a beautiful service sung by the Abbey choir and there is no charge.This time I returned at lunch-time on a Tuesday on June 12th. I was surprised to see that there was an adult admission fee of 16 pounds, about $25. (The Abbey literature states they receive no funds from the Church of England or the government which I find a little hard to believe, but whatever.) The price of admission includes an audiophone tour available in various languages and there is narration at 25 marked points around the abbey----although oddly, about 5 of them don't actually have any narration. Rick Steve's recommends a lunch time visit to avoid the most crowded times. We waited on a fairly short line and were able to see ehat we wanted to see even though it was crowded. The first structure on the site, a Benedictine Monastery, pre-dated the Norman Conquest of 1066. All British monarchs since William the Conqueror in 1066 have had their coronations here. The Abbey contains the graves (tombs) of many important people, including Queen Eliabeth I who shares a grave spot with her half sister with whom she battled for the throne. The famous Poets' Corner contains the graves or plaques dedicated to writers. The graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin were big draws for my scientist husband.The grave of Britain's unknown soldier of World War I and the graves of many generals and admirals reminds one of our dedication to war---in this holy place.For me, the goosebumps came from walking on stones worn down by the tread of 1,000 years of feet--- the famous, the doomed----and the tourists."

But even if you're not, this place should not be missed because of the wonderful history that has taken place within these walls. Coronations have been held here since 1066 and the tombs of many kings of queens are here as well. I especially like seeing Mary, Queen of Scots lying beside her enemy Elizabeth I. You'll recognize the Abbey if you watched Princess Diana's funeral or last year's royal wedding between The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Will and Kate). The audio guide is essential for understanding the history and for helping you find obscure tombs and markers. Go either first thing in the morning to avoid crowds, or show up around 4:15 to get in line for the 5:00 Evensong service. It's a shame you can't photograph the interior of the building but not having people snapping photos adds to the dignity of the building, not to mention the movement of the crowds! You haven't lived until you've heard music performed in this glorious space. Plan to spend several hours!"

Chaucer was the first poet buried in Westminster Abbey, but that was because he was a former clerk to the palace of Westminster, not because he wrote Canterbury Tales. It took another 150 years, when Spenser was buried too for the trend to become \"entrenched.\" Ben Johnson wanted to join Poet's Corner but was poor, so he begged for a \"mere two feet, not six\". When his wish was granted he was buried standing up! The list of famous names grew: Dickens, Tennyson, Browning, Kipling. Thomas Hardy was mostly buried here except for his heart, which went to his Dorset home. Others have memorials but are buried elsewhere: Shakespeare, Keats, Shelley, Milton, Blake, TS Elliot, and Gerard Manly Hopkins. Sir Walter Scott and Robert Burns share the limelight with Jane Austen, George Elliot (Mary Ann Evans), Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and the three Bronte sisters.The collage of famous minds reminds us of British contributions to the evolution of human thought: Lewis Carroll,DH Lawrence, Dylan Thomas,Oscar Wilde--and newcomers Noel Coward and Lawrence Olivier. Handel is there representing musicians, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin represent science, Cromwell, Gladstone, and Churchill represent politics. Thomas Parr is said to have been 152 at his death in 1635; his life outlasted most human memory in that time.And in the center of the room near the Western entrance is the British equivalent to the tomb of the unknown soldier, bordered in red flowers and where royal brides have taken to respectfully dedicating their bridal bouquets.The sheer volume of work produced by these women and men of letters rivals the fanfare usually reserved for kings and queens. Nowhere else is it memorialized all in one place."

I visited early (9:45) on a fine Wednesday in May; there was no line. It gradually became busy but not too crowded. The interior architecture is impressive from the simplicity of the cloisters to the splendor of Henry VII's Lady Chapel and to a royal history buff there is a major \" wow\" factor to be able to stand next to the tombs of Edward I, Henry V, Elizabeth I etc. I probably would not have been as happy - or waited to go in - if there had been excessive crowds, but I left feeling \"I'm glad I saw it, it was worth it\"."

It is amazing to be surrounded by 1000 years of history. Now here is a bonus tip: on most days at 5 PM, there is a service and concert (free since is an active church BTW). The regular paid tours end by 5 PM. At 4:30 PM, visitors line up outside for the free service/concert. The trick is to stay inside after your paid tour. There is a separate and priority queue inside behind a blue gate. Ask the tour guides where you return your audio guide for directions. Just remember not to exit. We lined up inside between 4:15 and 4:30 PM behind the blue gate. At about 4:50 PM, we were escorted into the Choir Section and allowed to sit amongst the Choir members and other dignitaries. The main doors then opened from the outside and those folks were seated in the main part of the church. Still excellent seats to hear the choir but the key is to sit with the Choir. The Choir is World-renowned and they are so good, we got goosebumps while they sang. The Evensong service was great and one of the highlights of our London visit. You must see it and Westminister Abbey - that is why I rate it as the #1 site in London - enjoy!"

I was quite impressed with the level of access that our tour was given, particularly that we were allowed onto the floors of both the Lords and the Commons. Walking through the Lords, we came just a few feet away from the throne the Queen uses when delivering the Queen's Speech and stood in the back where MPs would stand to hear it. In the Commons, it was quite amazing to have the chance to walk through a voting lobby, past the Speaker\u2019s Chair and the dispatch boxes (where the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition stand at to stare each other down during their weekly face offs) and to stand in front of the benches that MPs sit on, before crossing the Bar of the House on our way out of the chamber.

The interior of the architecture was magnificent and impressive - it feels like you're walking into history and one could have vivid imaginations of the royal ceremonies that were once held in there. The visit would have been more enjoyable and fascinating if i have done some reading before visiting - so the tip is: do prep yourself with some of the English history background, the famous kings and queens and the royal families that could be quite confusing. Expect to see many of the names in the abbey, and most of them have unique stories behind. It took me about 1-1.5 hours to finish the tour. Overall it was a good experience and i would include this as one of the must-visits if this is your first time to London."

The Verger assigned to our group, Peter, was perfectly entertaining as well as being extremely knowledgeable. OK, I didn't know what a Verger was, but learned about these lay assistants from our guide. The Verger tour goes places that most tourists can't, and I learned quite a bit about the history of the building iotself, plus the history of events that have taken place there over the centuries. Most importantly, with the crowds, the Verger's talent came in handy. This guy led our group around and did not tolerate interference. We were able to see all of the highlights in the 1.5 hour tour. Strongly recommend."

When we arrive in the abbey, we were not very impressed with the outside since seemed Notre Dame in Paris has more sculptures outside compare this one. Then we have to pay and queuing to go inside, add the negative point for visiting the place. We have to queue for ~ half hour before we arrive to the front desk to pay the ticket (probably due to weekend holiday). But we didn't regret our visit, since when we are inside then we were surprised with the detail and so many sections inside that has a history. The self-guided tour is good to explore the place. Following the map and the guided tour, you can explore the place for 1-1.5 hour. So many history with UK, that we're impressed with all the exhibition inside. There're so many names that buried inside the place. Additional exhibition for the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee, is a plus point."

I think this attraction needs a review and possible overhaul in terms of the way it is presented; I am sure it is not easy given its historic significance and therefore tourist appeal as well as being an active church. The queue system is cumbersome; poorly managed and slow; they could do with more people at the cash desk and doormen that know approximately how long the queue might take from a certain point. Although there is simple leaflet describing the key points of interest it was not clear to me where one went to obtain an audio guide and the key points of interest are not clearly described if you do not have the audio guide. We did enjoy the splendour and adventure of finding important elements that make this such an interesting cathedral church; particularly enjoyed the special exhibition of the Queen's relationship with the Abbey."

When we first arrived at the Abbey the queues to get in were stretched in two directions almost to the side gates, one queue is for cash only, the other for those paying by credit card, surprisingly our 'cash only' queue moved reasonably quickly, we were inside in 20 minutes. Audio guides are included in the entrance fee but we chose to pay another 3 pounds and take the Abbey's Verger tour, it was fabulous. Our guide Ian, was passionate, knowledgeable, humorous and energised, very keen to show us many features of the abbey within our 90 minute tour. The best part of the tour is being taken to parts of the Abbey where general visitors cannot go, like the choir stalls, and behind the high alter where there are many famous royal tombs. The Abbey is a beautiful piece of history, it is breathtaking, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit."

And I don't just mean the ones you encounter queuing up just to get in. Once in, we found it very difficult to find our way around - the signage and directions are poor, especially given the importance and number of visitors (they'd be smart to take some cues from the Tower of London, for example). There were just too many people as well. It was hard navigating through the crowds, getting close to some of the sections (there are several which feature narrow entry ways). Another recommendation would be to meter the number of people entering to control the flow. The lines would be longer outside (maybe book ahead online?) but would make for a more pleasant visit once you're in. We didn't try the audio guides, but many did - which also makes it hectic as people are often distracted by what they are listening to and not really paying attention to the people around them."

The numbers inside there are strictly limited (admittedly there is a resultant very long queue outside at times) and behavior strictly controlled - for example no loud talking is tolerated. The whole approach gives a much better experience for visitors.Dare I say it - perhaps the English could learn something from the Italians?But, back to the Abbey.

As a New Yorker, I noticed an interesting contrast between my city and London: In London, the museums have free admission (though you can give a donation if you wish); the churches charge for admission.

Shame that people do not observe that this is a place that requires respect, so not many places for quiet contemplation, but the history can almost be touched in this fantastic, impressive historic building."

            "review": "History in every nook and cranny. Take a pocket book and cram 2000 years of history, biographies, images and artefacts into it. The result is Westminster Abbey. Depending on the way you look at it, this can be either cramped or spectacular. For me, it was both. It was a spectacular and very alive introduction to the English monarchy, the church and history. The tombs, crypts, artefacts of monarchy, burials of luminaries such as Newton, fantastic stained glass windows... the list is endless. I spent about 5 hours exploring the place and still believe there was more to this place. Note the visitor timings - I was the last one to enter, past 12.30, more due to the sympathy of the guard at the entrance and one of the last to leave, at 5.00. The audio guide is a must - without this you will be lost and likely miss many of the spots. Do not miss the huge stained glass windows. Photography is prohibited inside the Abbey, but you can pick up the excellent guidebook - pricey as usual, at the souvenir store. The souvenir store has some interesting knick knacks, but nothing you will not find elsewhere, at a cheaper price. Budget atleast 3 hours to do any justice - I took 5."

            "review": "Westminster Abbey: immerse yourself in history. Nearest underground:St James's Park (District and Circle Lines) and Westminster (Jubilee, District & Circle Lines). We took District (green) line to the Westminster stop. Take some time before you go in and walk around, take in the amazing detail everywhere -- all the statuary, gargoyles, grotesques....TIP: When you go in (East side) there are two lines: one for cash only (left side) and one for credit cards only (right side). When the lines are long & there are crowds it's hard to see the small signs on where you go to queue up & pay. Although the lines looked long, we only stood outside for about 5 -10 minutes. 16 pounds per adult. **NOTE: NO pictures are allowed inside, which is nice both out of respect to worship & the dead, but also no one would ever be able to get anywhere if they allowed them. Upon entering you can pick up a free audio guide - laughed a bit as it is Jeremy Iron's voice for the audio guide. The audio guide is a nice additional bit of info & history if you don't take the guided tour. (We didn't take the tour, just walked around ourselves and it still took 3+ hours.) Take your time and take a deep breathe to deal with the crowds....The Abbey has many, many small chapels and nooks to see - hard thing is the way in is the way out too - barely wide enough for one person - so get used to scooting sideways and giving looks to people who try to stop in the doorway and talk(really?)Take time to go through all the chapels and rooms - amazing detail & history everywhere. Interesting that there can be detailed shrines & coffins so ornate - for someone who was \"only\" a merchant or businessman -- if you had the money, you could buy yourself a place in the most prestigious church in England. Fun to read the stories of the families and look at the ornate, rococo details, cherubs, coffins, pillars, paintings and more. Look Down! Everywhere you & everyone else will be walking on coffins/ crypts and dedications. Whilst sometimes hard to get people to move & see - take the time- there are some amazing stories and dates on the floor. In the floor, just inside the great west door, in the centre of the nave, is the tomb of The Unknown Warrior, an unidentified British soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War. He was buried in the Abbey on 11 November 1920. There are many graves on the floors of the Abbey, but this is the only grave upon which it is forbidden to step.The audio tour and plaques help with the \"main\" focus of the main part of the Abbey - the coffins of the great Kings & Queens of England. Edward the Confessor (founder of the church), Richard the II, Richard the III, Mary Queen of Scots, Henry the II, Henry the V, Elanor of Aquitaine, Elizabeth I - with her death mask used on the carvings on top --- those and many more are there to see. Take the time to step back, reflect and realize what you're getting to view. Take time in one of the larger areas to look at all the crests for the knights of the garter on the large poles and banners - there are some standard ones and some really funny / curious ones ( a fish, a loch ness monster, an ostrich.....)There is the \"Poet's Corner\" as well where you can see famous writers who are buried there: Chaucer was the first to be interred there in 1400....Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, Lord Byron, Spenser, Ben Johnson, Rudyard Kipling, Tennyson. There are also a great number of memorials there to writers (buried elsewhere): WH Auden, Jane Austen, the Brontes and more. Sir Laurence Olivier is also buried there. Take time to walk around the nave and other areas as well - we saw some areas bombed in the siege of WWII and learned some great history along the way. The coronation chair is also there --The Coronation Chair was made on the orders of King Edward I in 1300\u20131 to enclose the Stone of Scone (also called the Stone of Destiny), which he had brought from Scotland in l296 and placed in the care of the Abbot of Westminster. Until the removal of the Stone to Scotland in 1996 the Chair was the oldest piece of furniture in England still used for the purpose for which it was made. Pretty neat!There was a small cafe in the abbey as well and a very small gift shop. Most of the Abbey is not wheelchair accessible/ friendly and even those with other ambulatory issues (canes, etc) may have some challenges walking around the tiny areas. I can see that this would not be very interesting for your average kid under, say 10-12. We didn't do the guided tour, but sometimes were in the same area and gained some insight - so the tours may be well worth it. Took us 3+ hours and we definitely could have stayed longer."

            "review": "A spectacular yet crowded church!. Westminster Abbey is a Gothic monastery church in London, located next to the Big Ben and House of Parliament. It is the traditional place of coronation (all English monarchs since the coronation of William the Conqueror have been crowned here, except Lady Jane Grey, Edward V and Edward VIII) and burial for 13 English monarchs (since the time of Edward the Confessor until the death of George II in 1760, most Kings and Queen of English were buried here) and national figures (Charles Darwin, Sir Isaac Newton, David Livingstone and Charles Dickens). It is neither a cathedral nor a parish church, but a \u201cRoyal Peculiar\u201d under the jurisdiction of a Dean and Chapter, subject only to the Sovereign and not to any archbishop or bishop, in short it is a place of worship owned by the Royal Family. Since 1100, there have been at least 16 Royal Weddings at Westminster Abbey, including the latest royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.My first impression of this UNESCO World Heritage site was during the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and second was the royal wedding of Prince William. The Abbey seems smaller then. My first question when I entered was \u201cWell, this is what the British called a church? It is spectacular and huge (or crowded as more than a thousand people were buried here)\u201d. You would find something worth observing/admiring/exploring at almost every corner as there are 611 monuments excluding the graves and memorial stones on the floor. I've got no comments on whether it was worth the money to visit or not but i could certainly share the conversation i overheard and the information i found. While waiting for my turn to show my London Pass (so that i don't have to pay), I\u2019d heard one tourist asked a staff why do we need to pay to visit the Abbey? The staff politely advised him that he is welcome to take part in the daily services free of charge and may proceed to the links to the lefts to find out more about worship at the Abbey. In addition, he may also enter the Cloisters, College Garden and St Margaret\u2019s Church free of charge. I found out later that the Abbey really does not charge people who want to worship (so you get in for free after the regular opening hours for Evensong at 5pm on weekday and 3pm on weekend) but do rely almost entirely on paying visitors and tourists to cover running costs as it receives no funding from the Crown, the Church or the State. So kudos to everyone who visited the Abbey, you have done a good deed by simply visiting it (me too)!Highlights:i) The Shrine of St. Edward the Confessor with various British royalty tombs and the historic coronation throne nearby;ii) The statue of the Virgin Mary holding a baby Jesus;iii) The Henry VII\u2019s Chapel (aka Lady Chapel) built 1503 to 1512, with a magnificent vault.iv) The tombs and monuments of the famous;v) The cloisters originally built in the 13th century;vi) The beautiful octagonal Chapter house with original tile floor dating from 1250; andvii) The Nave with the grave of the unknown warrior.Important information:i) Open daily 9:30am to 4:30pm (last admission 3:30pm), except Wednesday till 7pm (last admission 6pm) and Saturday till 2:30pm (last admission 1:30pm). Closed on Sunday (for worship only), religious holidays and December 24 to 26;ii) Admission fee is applicable at \u00a316 for adult, \u00a36 for children 11 to 18 and free for child under 11. Free of charge with London Pass (but no skip-the-line priority);iii) Free admission to the Museum, Cloisters (you can find kiosk in the north cloister with souvenirs, books, food and drink for purchase), College Garden (Tues to Thursday only) and St. Margaret\u2019s Church with the admission ticket to the Abbey;iv) A Children\u2019s Trail (in English) is available free at the information desk as you enter the Abbey, and children are able to dress up as monks and have their photo taken in the Cloisters (Go to the the Abbey Museum and ask to borrow a costume); And lavatories are situated in the exit near Poet\u2019s Corner. v) Large or bulky items, such as rucksacks, suitcases and bagpacks are prohibited. Leave it in your hotel or else you may be asked to leave it at the left luggage facilities operated nearby;vi) Audioguides are available free of charge."

Once you are in you will receive a very basic map and a free audio guide. I don't usually like audio guides but this one was easy to use and simple to follow. As an added bonus, it was narrated by Jeremy Irons! My only complaint about the guide was it really skimmed the surface of what there is too see. Understandable as there are so many memorials/tombstones and works of art. My advice it to do some research beforehand or take the time to stop and look around. There are also guided tours but I think they cost more.Also be forewarned, the washrooms are hard to find and there will be another queue. There is a good gift shop and a 'coffee club' where you can enjoy drinks, sandwiches, soup & deserts looking out onto the cloisters. Not much seating though and it is on stone benches."

As London residents my husband and I frequently pass by and often say we should visit (in fact we've attempted to do so before, but gave up after queuing for a long time).We arrived yesterday and despite being slightly surprised at the high entrance fee (\u00a316 per adult), we picked up our audio guide and looked forward to the visit.All I can say is that the audio guide is superficial and sporadic. Very little detail is given on many of the historical figures buried there and there is very little reference to architectural features. For example, a stone commemorating Oliver Cromwell is completely overlooked in a 90 second description of the RAF Chapel; a 45 second description of the tomb of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York fails to explain the political significance of their marriage and the description of the tomb containing Mary I and Elizabeth I makes no mention of Henry VIII's marriage to the mothers and the implications of his divorce for religious reform in England.Overall we came away with the impression that the audio guide was designed to propel visitors through the abbey as quickly as possible - with an emphasis on keeping visitors moving, rather than trying to explain the history of the Abbey. Last year we visited St Paul's and had been hugely impressed by its audio guide - which had so much detail that after 4 hours we still hadn't completed the tour. Westminster Abbey should learn from this. At present, it fails to cater for any visitor hoping to achieve more than crossing it off a \"things to do in London\" list.To any tourists with time just to visit one cathedral while in London, I'd recommend heading straight for St Paul's."

Leave enough time to get through the line up at the entrance (not so bad during the week), take the guided tour, re-trace your steps at your own pace and spend some time reading all the plaques and markers. There are so many famous people from history who have graced the halls of the Abbey and who are buried there that a quick 1hr in-and-out tour just won't cut it.I'm amazed at what people complain about when on vacation but I can assure you that the entrance fee is worth it and the fact that you can't take photos in the church should not detract from the grandeur of your visit.

At one particular number the coronation chair was supposed to be positioned, but we hunted high and low to no avail. The shop and food were discretely located, but the toilets were even more hidden (if there were any) a shame as all tourists have a need once in a while! The amount of history was immense and being British my chest felt rather more puffed up than usual.It is thirty years since I last visited and I am glad I made the effort this time, especially at Easter time. It is a shame that photographs are not allowed."

This is much better than at the tower of London where the hire of a giude is on top of the allready steep entry charge. I found the audio giude great . It was narrated by Jeremy Irons who's voice is clear as a bell. The information was consice and to the point. The toumbs of all the various Kings and Queens was very impressive but I was most impressed by Poets corner. We visited the Cathedral at 2pm and there were no queues but I believe that if you visit early there can be an uncomfortable crowd. So go later."

The audio guide was a valuable tool enabling us to fully understand what we were seeing. At ground level, there were tombs and plaques indicating the kings, queens and various famous people who were buried within the the abbey. Looking up, we saw the most amazing masonry and ornate timberwork on the gothic vaulted ceilings. No photography was allowed which disappointed DH so as we left, we added another booklet to our collection."

It is a one-stop shop that surpasses pretty much any other place for historical-impact-per-square-meter - there is an informative audio tour that talks you through all the statues and crypts and tombs and historical memorabilia, and my kids (9 and 7) and I really, really enjoyed it. My daughter just finished reading some historical fiction about Queen Elizabeth I as a child so was excited to see her tomb, and my son recognized many names, as well, and was impressed that they were all gathered together. There's also a fun \"scavenger hunt\" kind of sheet that directs them to answer questions about various spots in the Abbey to keep them reading / listening to the tour, and they were so engaged in it that they were upset because we had to leave early so they couldn't finish. The Abbey's very close to Big Ben and Parliament, too, so it's a good tourist stop, generally - not much to eat nearby, though, so be sure to plan accordingly. You have to walk quite a ways to get to find anything..."

If I had not done this I would not have learned that the magnificently decorated tomb painted with medieval heraldic devices , but with absolutely no inscriptions anywhere, is the tomb of the Standard Bearer to Henry V.

Westminster Abbey was founded in 960 and stands near the Embankment at Westminster, opposite the Houses of Parliament between Victoria Street and Abingdon Street. It's Lantern Tower stands tall, and nestled at its foot is St. Margaret's Church. It is expensive to go in for a tour, which takes about two hours. Sixteen pounds sterling or approx. CAD$25.00. But it is worth it as you will discover many fascinating, historical treasures inside. Besides, when will you be coming this way again. Originally a Benedictine monastery, Kind Edward (later Edward the Confessor) greatly enlarged it into a large stone church. His magnificent tomb sits behind the High Altar. The coronation of William the Conqueror took place in 1066, and every monarch since has been crowned here. The Coronation Chair dates back to this first coronation. The Abbey is the burial place of kings (Henry III,Edward I, Edward III, Richard II, Henry V), statesmen, poets (William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, William Blake, Robert Burns, Lord Byron, John Keats, Rudyard Kipling, John Milton, William Wordsworth), scientists (Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin), warriors (grave of the Unknown Warrior is now a place of pilgrimage) and musicians (Henry Purcell). The Abbey is also home to choristers (WA Choir), an organist, scholars (Westminster School). The glorious Lady chapel was built by King Henry VII, first of the Tudor monarchs. Queen Elizabeth I is buried in the north aisle. It boasts the Battle of Britain memorial window by Hugh Easton. The Abbey contains over 600 monuments and wall tablets, and over three thousand people are buried here."

Jeremy Irons (who narrates the great audio tour which is included in the price of admission - currently 16 pounds) alludes to this when he stated at one point that \"you may not be able to get into this area of the Abbey\"! However, luckily, when we were there, the crowds were not at all bad, and we had a ton of space to really appreciate this wonderful building. So much history really makes you feel small, but it is truly wonderful to visit the place where all of England's kings and queens have been crowned. Well worth the small admission price, especially in a city where many of the best attractions are free."

But in my experience the interior is dark, grey, and mostly made of synthetic fabrics. I only ever saw the backs of the other tourists as we were snaked through the building like a very busy day at Ikea. Being only 5'6\" probably didn't help, and having to queue for ages to get in and even longer to get out didn't help my mood. Perhaps if at the end of the experience I had some memories of a few stunning carvings it may have been worthwhile but sadly all I remember is just how many people were wearing grey synthetic coats. My kids of course hated it with a passion! If you can find a day when there are few other tourists then it might be worth a visit but otherwise I would give it a wide berth."

We kept thinking of families, especially so soon after the Royal Wedding, who might really be disappointed at perhaps not being able to afford the price. We both thought it was shameful. On principle we didn't go in but instead visited St Margaret's, almost next door. This is where the \"big\" weddings used to occur. It's also known as the MPs' church, being just opposite the Houses of Parliament. It was wonderful. Well worth the visit. And free! As an English person, I think it's disgraceful that our museums are free but we have to pay to visit our most famous church. Talk about the Church of England cashing in. I know it's a World Heritage Site but I still think it's disgraceful. As you can no doubt tell, I'm extremely angry about the cost of this entrance fee. We've visited some beautiful churches in Europe with world famous works of art and not had to pay."

Definitely get a head set (they are free as you come in) because there are not many plaques to show what all of the tombs are and where everything is so I feel like we may have missed out on a little bit because of that.

As much a history of English consciousness as an abbey used for coronations and the like, this is a must-see at least once in your life!

The audio guide was not particularly good; my advice to anyone who has never been before would be to buy the guidebook first. Of course there is the obligatory gift shop, but the quality of goods on sale is a cut above the norm, and at the moment there are some nice diamond jubilee souvenirs which aren't as garish as some of the offerings seen elsewhere in town! One final thing. Having seen and marvelled at it all (not forgetting the coronation chair which is now near the front entrance!) pause at the tomb of the unknown soldier and reflect........."

We went on a Wednesday and there was no queue. We chose a Wednesday because it's open to visitors until 6pm but part of the church was blocked to tourists at 4.45 for a 5pm service so we still didn't get to see it all. My other criticism is the audioguide - it's good as far as it goes, but the explanations are very brief and only mention the top highlights. There are lots of really old looking and big tombs and monuments which you can only find out about if you are able to read the Latin inscriptions. I accept that there is so much there it would be impossible to include everything on the audioguide, but I think they could do much better and include more material. Still worth it though - one of my top places to visit in all of Europe."

Spend long enough and all sorts of interesting things pop up and the staff there are very amenable especially when it is not too busy.

Now you can barely sneeze without getting someone on your case. And the Abbey is packed, just packed. You cannot stand around and read something or take in the grandeur of the cathedral.

From the moment we walked in I must have said \u201cwow\u201d about 1,000 times. I think what REALLY impressed me was you can actually see how old everything is. If you look behind the statues, you can see the walls behind them and how much they\u2019ve changed. Look on the walls and you\u2019ll see how high the door ways used to be. Look up and around and you\u2019ll see old passage ways that you desperately want to know where they lead to. The history of the building is absolutely amazing to think about, I mean the floor at the high alter is older than my whole country!!! It was mind blowing to sit and think that I was in the ACTUAL Westminster Abbey. The Abbey is absolutely amazing; HOWEVER, the Henry VII Lady Chapel puts it to shame. You will know exactly what I mean when you step into it. It took my breath straight from out from my lungs. The ceiling in this Chapel was in the running to be one of the wonders of the world, and I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s not a wonder. It\u2019s stunning!! You will not be able to stop looking up; they\u2019ve even put a mirror in the room so you can instead look into the mirror to look up. I spent a great deal of time in this chapel taking in its beauty. There\u2019s another part of the Abbey that has a few of the original windows, flooring and paintings that made it through the Blitz that are impressive. If you\u2019re looking for Charles Darwin\u2019s tomb, it\u2019s very easy to miss; we had to have a staff member point it out to us. If you\u2019re facing Newton\u2019s tomb walk to your left, almost directly beside it and there it is on the floor. A lot of the tombs around the Abbey have inscriptions about the person buried there but Darwin\u2019s just simply has his name.I've read a few of the negative reviews of Westminster Abbey and would have to say I completely disagree. I know that each person has a different experience but in no way do I think the staff was rude or that the \u00a316 was a rip off. In fact the many staff members that we talked to provided \"inside\" facts that you probably would have missed if you hadn't talked to them. Such as, the wooden seats in the Henry VII Lady Chapel is dedicated to the very first Prime Minister of Canada (I'm Canadian and a HUGE history buff, and one of the staff members gave my British bf this tip to impress me and it definitely worked). We were also told that a lot of the jewels on tombs (etc.) are missing to a certain height because people used to steal them, not because of their age. Keep that in mind when you look around and you\u2019ll see how much has actually been stolen. Some have said the staff is rude but if anything, I would encourage you to talk to them. The audio tours are free and are definitely worth it so make sure you grab one. I think someone might consider this a rip off if they weren\u2019t really into history or churches, but if you are, this is a MUST SEE! In my opinion, the Abbey is worth every penny and every moment you\u2019ll spend in it!"

We'd been to the Abbey before many times so weren't there as tourists; we simply wanted to attend the evening service again, something we've done before several times and really enjoyed. The Abbey is an amazing space and, while I can understand why they are charging tourists for entry, I think the Abbey needs to really rethink how they operate. As a UK citizen I was horrified to see how staff spoke to tourists from Spain, Italy and the USA. It was very rude and people were visibly taken aback.

There is fabulous art and architecture to take in while you wander in and out of the different areas of the abbey. While we were visiting, there was a photo exhibit of William and Kate's wedding set up within the abbey to view.All-in-all, it was quite awe-inspiring.

The kids scavenger hunt provided by the Abbey was excellent, as were the audio tours included with admission. I was able to explore the Abbey in a new way and get more detailed information. There is something interesting in every part of the Abbey. I especially enjoyed the chapels where Queens Mary and Elizabeth are buried. I also loved Poet's Corner, and I enjoyed seeing the marker of Charles Darwin. I asked the guide for any tidbits of info and discovered that the archbishop and Prime Minister refused to attend his funeral. In that immediate area, a poor man is buried standing up, as it was too expensive to pay for him to be buried laid out. Very grand and beautiful and the cloisters are interesting too. I was sorry there was no brass rubbing any longer. The kids were thrilled with the huge chocolate coins they were given after completing the scavenger hunt. A great day out.

You definitely want to do this, because no inside photography is allowed. One huge highlight was St. Edward's chapel, closed to tourists for the most part, but open for a short prayer service at 3:00, which I attended; I spent several hours at Westminster on a Wednesday afternoon, then returned on Sunday for Palm Sunday services, which was absolutely amazing, and unforgetable experience!!!

My goddaughter was enthralled by the Abbey and to think she had seen this on the tv to now be standing in the Abbey. The Abbey is a spectacle to be seen with some wonderful history information and exhibits to see and learn about.

Coronation site, royal marriages, tombs, monuments, etc., this place has all of it and then some, centuries of world renowned history, all in one place. We waited about ten minutes to get in the door. The entry fee is reasonable. The self-guided tours are fantastic, very easy to use and very easy to understand, and narrated by the incredibly English Jeremy Irons. The handsets allow you to go at your own pace, and they even have little video screens that offer supplemental videos for aspects of the tour. You can go as fast or as slow as you want. Be sure to keep a watch under your feet for the hundreds of burial plaques in the floor. And check out the oldest door in Britain, coming in at almost 1,000 years old. Very cool place, extraordinarily impressive architecture, art, and history. Very helpful and friendly staff, too."

When i found myself back in the city again this month i thought it was time to see the Abbey, especially in the year of the Royal wedding.The entry fee is pretty steep \u00a316 if i remember rightly. But for that you get an audio guide and plenty of time to explore the place at your own pace.I felt the audio guide was pitched perfectly. Enough information to make things interesting and add to your knowledge, but not too much to be boring or feel like a history lecture. Its voiced by Jeremy Irons.The thing i enjoyed about the place the most was that the historical figures who were involved with the Abbey and are buried here, are the people you learnt about in school and are in films etc now. So you already know a bit about them which, for me, made it far more interesting to learn a bit more through the audio guide and see where they were buried.The surprised about the Abbey was the scale of it. Inside was mostly as i had imagined, but there are lots of little chambers off the main part. There is also a lovely courtyard area which we spent a while wandering around.We were there for around 90 mins which for us was enough time to see everything that we wanted to without feeling overloaded. One tip is that we arrived as it was opening on a weekday morning and found that the volume of people was entirely manageable. The audio guide often said \"this part of the Abbey is very busy so make sure you keep walking here\". So its obviously somewhere that can get a bit overwhelmed with visitors as the day goes on. We never had to compete with lots of tourists and had time to look at things for as long as we wanted to. So maybe its a good idea to make this your first port of call on your day of sightseeing."

A wonderful Who's Who of English literature, Poet's Corner features memorials to great British writers buried elsewhere as well as those entombed at the Abbey. As an American, I was pleased to see T. S. Eliot and Henry James remembered by their adopted country. And the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, surrounded by poppies, is a moving sight indeed.I'm a little shocked by previous posters' suggestions that the admission fee is too high, and it dismays me to think that people would \"sneak\" photographs despite the plainly stated prohibition. Avoid the crowds by arriving early, before the doors open, and spend a half an hour in the queue. You'll have a chance to admire the splendid exterior and chat with other excited tourists. I've read many recommendations of the verger tours, which cost a little extra. No doubt they're excellent, but I found the audioguide to be more than adequate.

There are certainly tombs and tributes to a great many famous historical figures and giants of the various arts, etc., but...if you're looking for a breathtakingly beautiful venue: go to St. Peters in the Vatican or almost any church in any major city in Italy.

Westminster Abbey is definitely worth a visit, and I would recommend doing it inconjunction with the guided tour of the Houses of Parliament as the stories go together well.There is a fee (about $30 USD) but that includes the audio guide, which was vital to the experience. It gets very crowded inside, but you are able to see everything and keep moving. It took about 60 minutes to go through the audio tour, and I spent another 30 sitting and looking around (had time to kill before the tour of Parliament) at the end. So relatively quick visit (its very crowded, so it is not easy to stroll through). They do not let you go backwards, so once you move forward you must keep going forward on the audio guide path. I found it worth the visit due to its historic values, but honestly once you have seen one cathedral (i.e the Vatican or Notre Dame), they all kinda run together...or the visit loses its \"wow factor\" in my opinion.Overall worth the visit and a must-see in London."

They were extremely rude to some tourists who tried to take photos. This is how desperate they are to get you to buy the postcards and books in the bookstore. 3) Long queues - I would say the main reason for this is because the staff at the ticket counter are inefficient.

Not only is it a beautiful building, but it has a very interesting history which was detailed in a rather organized manner utilizing an audio guide with short and succint explanations that made the visit very interesting, informative and not at all tiresome. Having had a little bit of a history lesson on the kings and queens of the country was quite helpful as we were given a tour of their resting places. We got to see memorials to and resting places of manys famous English poets, scientists and writers, including Shakespeare, George Elliot, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. It was worth the entire amount spent and a lovely cap to our last day in London. There did not seem to be a strict dress code, but then seeing as it was a cool rainy day everyone was dressed warmly and therefore conservatively. Some areas would prove difficult to manouevre for wheel chair occupants and I would recommend comfortable shoes. On the whole a tour of the place, with my compulsory stop at the gift store (much to my husband's chagrin!), took about 1.5 hours.On the whole, highly recommended."

I suppose because it is so crowded that they don't want you hanging around in one place too long so unfortunately you don't get much detail. Another thing is that you cannot take photographs. Again this is likely due to the extreme crowds and not due to any religious issues. If everyone was trying to take photos it would be a mad house.

The abbey is fantastic - included in the ticket price are audio guides. The English audios are narrated by Jeremy Irons \"Scar\" in Disney's Lion King - although known invariably for this part he is a classically trained actor with a lovely emotive voice. You cannot take pictures inside the abbey itself - but there are still opportunities to take pictures in the gardens and cloisters.When we arrived (afternoon) it was very very busy - and indeed, this was mentioned in the audio so this may be an ongoing factor at any time of the day. I enjoyed the break when a cleric went into the pulpit, requested silence and stillness (which in the main was adhered to by the tourists) and he delivered a brief prayer.Fascinating to see the richness of history - helped immeasurably by the audio ... our two teens listened throughout ... but were rather quicker than us at going from place to place (throughout the abbey there are key points numbered and you key in the number and listen to the brief description of the history). They ended up waiting for us to finish. They waited quietly - remembering that the abbey is a place of worship - however I wouldnt advise taking very young children .The Abbey gift shop was good - all price ranges were available... saw no tacky gifts."

Having collected an audioguide we proceeded along the guided tour. Overall, the information provided was very limited and hardly worth the effort of listening. Some of the commentary in the cloistered wasn't even working. The abbey itself isn't spectacular to be honest. Sure, there are the tombs of dead queens, kings and other important people but the building itself and the way everything was organized in it was unimpressive. I wouldn't recommend this if you were tight for time in London or tight for cash, at 16 pounds it's definately overpriced."

Your bags are checked, which is good and I rather liked the fact that no photography is allowed so you weren't being elbowed all the time or having to dodge cameras.Cons: - very expensive \u00a316 for adults, \u00a313 for senior citizens.- it was heaving yesterday and I found that really unpleasant as we were being pushed and jostled all the way through. The place is much smaller than I expected.- some areas are really badly signposted so you don't know what number to press on your free audio guide. Could one of the guides walk around with the audioguide and check that everywhere is listed?- more tours please. We had just missed the 2.30pm tour, which seemed to be the last of the day, and for \u00a33 it would have been good value for money.- really crass that you are directed through an overpacked, overheated, small gift shop at the end. Not on guys.- and what about Gift Relief for your entrance fee? Surely you have charitable status and I'm sure you have a fair number of UK visitors. You might be able to lower your entrance fee as a result!!I think I will go back in the Autumn when the crowds have died down and go for one of the non-fee paying services as advised by the previous poster."

And, of course, there are many, many famous people buried there. The building itself is impressive but there are better elsewhere. What set it apart for us from so many churches and cathedrals all over Europe was attending an Evensong service late in the afternoon with the all male choir with young boys singing the higher parts. Only Evensong at King's College in Cambridge was better. Not being Anglican or Episcopalean we weren't familiar with Evensong services but have decided they have to be the best church service available. When else can you get heavenly music, lots of scripture and prayers, all in 45 minutes, and NO sermon. Sounds perfect!Note that while there is a hefty fee to tour Westminster Abbey, attending Evensong is free. We found you notice a lot more when you sit in one spot for 45 minutes then when you walk at a regular pace through any building. Enjoy the atmosphere."

The church has so much history in its walls and more memorials and monuments than anyone can keep track of. If history is not your thing, that's OK---just go inside and take a seat. Look at the amazingness surrounding you! While the church is humongous it surprisingly has a homey feel to it. The High Altar was gorgeous, the cloisters were jaw dropping. The only thing that I didn't like was no photos (as is the norm in most churches). I just wish I could have a photo of this amazing church to show to people. We used the audio guides and found them extremely helpful and informative. At the top of the hour the staff takes a moment for a prayer which we were present for. Love, love, loved it!"

I must admit it was a fantastic couple of hours and extremely informative. I've listed below a few tips which may assist with your visit.Upon arriving at Westminster Abbey, the first thing you see is 2 long queues, which many people took one look at and walked away from. Dont. The queues move very quickly, so just join one.The 2 queues are for different payment types. When we were there the queue on the left was for cash only and the queue on the right for Credit Cards. Make sure you get in the right line!If you can, pay cash as this line moved quicker.There is no bag storage available. So i wouldn't suggest this is an attraction which you visit on your last day in London, and you are carrying lots of bags.The visit is expensive. \u00a316 for adults. When some people saw this price, they got out of line and walked off. Dont. It may seem expensive to start with but it is definitely worth it.As soon as you enter the Abbey get a guided audio tour. They come in many languages and are very informative.There are also stands with guides to the Abbey located at the entrance. Pick up one of these as well.Together the guide and the map will plan your route around the building, ensuring you see everything and at the same time, you'll hear some great historical facts. The first 3 audio recordings are long, but stick with them, it's just sets the scene and the rest of them are much shorter.Make sure you visit every area you can get into, as there are some fantastic tombs and rooms through some of the tiny doorways you never would have thought to visit!The Abbey is vast and you could easily spend a couple of hours, if not longer, but looking at everything. Make sure you leave yourself enough time to see it all.Above all just enjoy your visit and soak up the historical atmosphere, it really is a special place and very beautiful."

            "review": "Five star destination - decidedly two star visitor experience. There's no doubt Westminster Abbey is a magnificent building, full of history and royal and political associations. Unfortunately, the Abbey itself is clearly being used as a cash cow by those who run it. First off, you need to queue - and you'll be in that queue for a long time. When one finally reaches the ebtrance, one's bag is searched. Of course, we all have to accept that in these times - but that's no excuse for the brusque arrogance of the man doing the checking on the day I visited; he turned rudeness into an art form. Once inside, having paid a steep entrance fee, the Abbey is heaving with other visitors, giving little or no chance to appreciate the beauty therein. The Abbey also has a no photography rule. That's their right, of course, though I can't help thinking back to a visit to Notre Dame in Paris two years ago when I could take pictures of anything I wanted. What isn't pleasant is the the Draconian way in which the policy is policed. Worse, I downloaded an app for my iPhone ahead of my visit. This app has been developed and is sold by the Abbey itself and contains a map and points of interest in the Abbey. Naturally I assumed I could use this app as I walked round - indeed the app would only make sense inside the Abbey itself - but I was snapped at (no exaggeration) to turn it off when I tried using it. Clearly, then, the app is regarded as another source of revenue and not an aid to the visitor. To say I was disappointed in the way the Abbey is run is an understatement. It could, and should, be so much better; the Abbey staff could learn lessons from, say, The Tower of London, where the Yeoman Warders and the Tower staff are magnificent. The pity here is that Westminster Abbey is a wonderful place to visit and I'd recommend it to anyone. But they really do need to brush up their customer service skills."

We started out with the audio guide (narrated by Jeremy Irons) but decided to pay the 3 pounds (yes, only 3 pounds) for the guided tour. Best three pounds we spent in London. The guided tour is an hour and a half and the verger who led the tour was very knowledgeable. He led us to many of the tombs of famous people buried here, including poets, authors, kings, queens, scientists, and politicians. But there was also a great deal of history about the cathedral itself, including its use in coronations and for the recent wedding of William and Kate. Plan to spend about three hours. Some tips: - Do get there early; the lines were much longer during the day - They do not allow photography - It is an active church, and every hour someone leads a one minute prayer, and they ask everyone to be quiet. About 98% of the visitors observed this; the other 2% got very dirty looks from the staff and other visitors. - Food, drink, and toilet facilities are limited. Take care of that ahead of time. - The gift shop had one cash register open upstairs, and there were about 30 people in line. At the back of the gift shop are stairs down to a gift shop annex area that has much nicer items and a second checkout, and there was nobody in line. This was well worth the time spent, and in terms of priorities I would put it on a par with the major castles (Windsor and The Tower)."

People were getting wet waiting in the rain and i discovered that there was only 4or 5 toilets for the whole of the abbey which is quiet bizarre considering the amount of people.The toilets are unisex and had the wash basin and drier inside the cubicle.There is a shop outside the main Abbey but because we spent so much time waiting for the toilet we had no time left and we hotfooted it to our tour at 3pm at the houses of parliment ."

I would love to see a CG video on how cathedrals such as Westminster Abbey were built 1,000 years ago. I was very thankful for the audio guide as we would have been lost without it. I was very disappointed to see the \"No Photos\" sign as I bought a new camera for our trip to London, specifically to photograph the beautiful cathedrals. We went inside other churches, paid no admission fees and were able to snap away. However, we paid a steep 16 pound (per person) admission fee to Westminster Abbey and were not allowed to take a single photo. I'm not sure of the reason or if it has anything to do with the gift shop at the end. I had my camera around my neck since we'd been out sightseeing all day and my camera bag was in the bottom of the backpack my husband was carrying. I'm glad I'm not the only one who was harassed by the \"tour guides\" at the Abbey. I know some people do not abide by the rules (or perhaps did not see the signs since there were only a few and posted in English only) but there was no need to walk around like the camera police. The gentleman who spoke with me was extremely rude and was unnecessarily so. If they're going to be that strict about the rule then they should have a secure place for people to check their belongings at the door. Overall, it was a beautiful sight to see and we enjoyed it immensely. However, the admission was a little steep and I found the staff to be rude and unhelpful."

We queued for ages to get in - to be expected: it was a Saturday, just after the Abbey's starring role on worldwide TV and it is high tourist season.The Abbey is an interesting visit for anyone into history. I was rather thrilled to see the tombs of some of our most famous sovereigns. I do not want to put people off visiting.But......I do have an issue with the entry fee. \u00a316! What??!!! Britain take note: many other nations do not charge nearly as much for comparable sites, or they charge nothing at all. (We visited some of the greatest artwork in the world in Rome's churches and the only money we spent was voluntarily, in the gift shop and in the donation box - a fair exchange and as there were no charges, we spent and donated generously. I think people would do the same here.) After queueing and paying the fee we gained entry at about 12.30. The Abbey closed for worship at 1.30. Whilst no one actually told us to leave, as it neared 1.30 chairs etc were being moved about hastily by staff and it felt like visitors were now unwelcome. Fair enough, but if they want people to leave after just an hour perhaps they should not charge so much to get in. To add to the frustration, the parts I really wanted to see - the Alter screen, the Last Supper and the restored pavement were closed off and could only be seen from a distant and awkward angle. I know they are sacred and I didn't want to stomp about on them, but I would have liked a closer look. These are beautiful highlights of the Abbey.Places of worship are just that, not tourist sites, but if they are famous people want to see them. The upkeep and facilties need paying for...but the fee is too high."

We just could not get peace to look at anything in the Abbey withour some jumped up official was in our faces about our camera.We are miidle aged, we can READ and we saw the polite notice to advise that no photos were to be taken. But, all around we could see were small cameras or mobile phones flashing, and staff did tell these individuals to stop, which ok was fine. But to be challenged by some jumped up \"official\" when we abided by the no photo rule after paying 32 bloody pounds is bloody appalling. This was a total WASTE of our money the attitude of these wardens/ jobsworth whatever...there wasn't even any candles to light for our dearest departed. All we could hear was \"turn your camera off, have you got a lens cap on that camera you are not allowed to take photos\"Not once were staff there to help or guide any of us who had paid well over the odds to get into the Abbey.Well we reckon it was a rip off and we will be asking for our money back. Because they are a supposed House of God does not mean they can RIP off people, remember Jesus overturned tables because of money making rackets!"

Arrived maybe 10 minutes before it opened, and it was just a matter of processing the line to get in, maybe 20 mins? I guess 16 pounds is on the pricey side, but I'm glad that we spent the money on this and not the London Eye. The free audioguide tour was interesting, everything is very beautiful in there, too bad that you can't take any photos in there, I had no idea that there so many royalty members and others are buried there. I would give yourself 1-1.5 hours to see everything. It's too bad that some of the other people who wrote reviews experienced rude parishioners, I found them to be very helpful and greeted us very warmly."

We are all very interested in history, and this place just oozes history! First, go as early as possible. There WILL be crowds, some of the areas are very tight, be patient and polite, but assertive when needing to move around.Second, I don't think 16 lbs (around $26 US) is asking a lot considering what you have the honor to see here. Think of it as a donation for upkeep of this beautiful Abbey. This place holds so many treasures of history! You do have to have an interest in these things, if you're in London for shopping, theater, and the nightlife among many other things, and have very little interest in history (to each his own) you may not appreciate it.However, if you're like me (and my family) pay the extra 3 lbs for the verger tour....it's extraordinary! You go into places in a small group that the general public IS NOT ALLOWED to enter. Our verger was an excellent tour guide, my husband, daughter and I were just so impressed with him and this private tour was priceless. We went into the chapel of Edward the Confessor for example, this is not open to the general public. Just awesome! I didn't watch the royal wedding except for a few moments to see the inside of Westminster and we were elated to see that our verger was standing behind Catherine Middleton during the readings! That was him with his verge ! Wow! I was actually on those steps that the couple were married on just last month with the verger who was standing right near them. Lucky us! Can't wait to go for the third time some day."

The church (yes, despite some reviews here, it is still very much an active, working church) is literally packed with the remains of Britain's most recognized names from history. Best bet to see it all and get a true feel for the history...take the London Walks tour on Mondays...meet at Westminster Tube station at 10:45 and you'll beat the entrance queues and get a personal tour...all for about 5 pounds more than you'd pay for admission to the site (16 pounds). Well worth having someone point out the hidden gems of the site and allow you to marvel at this man-made wonder."

The bad points- firstly the 2 hour wait in line to get in. And the Italian tourists that decided to cut in line 20 mins before the end then pretend not to know English when we protested. That's hardly the Abbey's fault though. Secondly the massive entry price. Thirdly, when we got our audio headsets we found that my wife and mine were different. My commentaries were double hers and some sites that mine had commentary on hers didn't. When she took hers back they told her that MY audio was wrong. Because it was such a busy day, they were handing out the abridged version of the tour to get people through quicker. I would be more understanding of that if we hadn't just paid 16 pounds to get in. It was Easter Saturday and it had been closed for 3 days before and was going to be for 2 days after which explains why everyone was there and why it was so busy, but it wasn't a highlight of our trip. If you can come if it's an off day and you're and English history junkie or religious type then it's probably worth doing, but for me I wish I'd headed to the museum or one of the other places I've missed on this trip. Oh and keep your wife away from the gift shop. Probably another thing that's not the Abbey's fault ;)"

Due to a national protest taking place in the city which was another surprise, the buses were running at the speed of a 1 footed turtle, all taxis were experiencing the same difficulties as the buses, literally NOT being able to move, some of the trains weren't running, and getting to and from specific points was extremely difficult to do. I knew my time was limited so my expectations to make it to just 2 sites I felt was reasonable. One site was Westminster Abbey. By the time I found it, the Saturday afternoon church service was getting out. People were walking out the doors and I waited until most of the people had exited. There were 2 male parishioners standing by the gates where the people were exiting. I explained to both men I was from the U.S., I realized that I wouldn't make any tours, but I wanted to know if I could please just look in the doors, and not go in any further because I knew I probably wouldn't ever get back to see this church in my lifetime. I had been crying because of everything that could go wrong did go wrong on this day. Instead of a kind, or nice \"no mam, I'm sorry but you can't\" , these 2 men responded with \"NO, that's just too bad for you lady\". I was extremely kind and their lack of respect put me into more tears. They knew they had further upset me and told me to get out of their way. There was a couple that heard me that came out of the service and they tried talking to these 2 men and they were just as rude to them. Now, I'm a little confused with this. In the United States, when you visit a church people are friendly and helpful and don't treat you like you're a second class citizen. Shame on these 2 men. People like this, especially working in a church, give the reputation to London of being snobby and rude. Even if I could, I never want to go back. These 2 men should have their butts thrown out onto the street and not allowed to be part of a church. Obviously, people that have the appearance of having money are treated completely differently."

However, there are some negative points I need to make, not about the building itself and its contents, but about the way tourists are managed. Firstly I was shocked by the price -\u00a316 per person! I had thought of bringing my family to visit, but it would just be too expensive. This is our national heritage and should be accessible to everyone. There is no way people on lower incomes could afford these prices, meaning that this is a facility only for those who are well off. I don't think Jesus would have approved of this.The other thing was that initially we did not wish to use the audio tour, but wanted just to enjoy the atmosphere of the cathedral. This seemed to attract unwelcome attention from the stewards in their red gowns. One came up to me and said 'may I help you' in a very suspicious way because I was not walking in the direction as required by the audio tour. He then pointed to the audio equipment; when I explained we didn't want to use it , he looked perturbed and asked to see my ticket. In the end we did use the equipment, because the leaflet provided included very little information, and there weren't many information signs. At the end of the tour we realised we had not seen Queen Elizabeth 1st 's tomb and so asked another steward, who seemed shocked and asked to see our tickets, expressing disbelief that we had not seen the tomb.It seems that because our movements around the building deviated very slightly from the 'standard' tourist , we were seen as potentially dishonest."

Even if you are on a short visit to London, do leave some time for a visit to the Abbey \u2013 there is nothing like it to give you an insight into British history and culture. Besides, some parts of the cathedral (such as the Lady Chapel) are stunningly beautiful, and the Poets\u2019 Corner is a must see for anyone familiar with British literature.The cathedral tends to get quite crowded at times, and more often than not there are lines at the entrance. One way to avoid lining up is coming nearer the latest admission time (which is 3:30 p.m. on most days and 6:00 p.m. on Wednesdays) \u2013 say, around 2:00-2:30 p.m. because if you come right at the end of the day, you might find some of the chapels already closed. The entrance fee is \u20a4 15 per person including a free audio guide available in a big choice of languages. There is a separate line for those who want to pay with credit cards.Make sure you get the audio guide, which gives a fantastic commentary on all the highlights of the cathedral. Taking pictures is not allowed but the cathedral gift shop has a good choice of postcards, booklets, and books as well as different memorabilia. Don\u2019t miss St Margaret\u2019s Church next to the Abbey with some beautiful stained glass windows (the entrance is free).In addition to coming as a tourist, consider attending a daily service (there is an evening service at 5:00 p.m. on weekdays) or an organ recital on Sunday at 5:45 p.m. \u2013 and you will get a very special feeling of the Westminster Abbey as a living church not just a monument."

I am glad that I finally did.For those who have been to Europe a few times, thinking \"this is just another church\", I would argue that Westminster Abbey is quite different. First, unlike Italian churches which would be more about art and religion, this Abbey offers great insight into English history and the birth of Anglican church (ie - kings and queens). The architecture is also quite different from the Catholic, Lutheran, Orthodox churches that you will find on the mainland. Although not a huge fan of audioguide, I have to say that this is probably one of the best one that I have listened to. Narrated by Jeremy Irons, the audio passages are relatively short and to the point.As this is a place of worship, the opportunity to take pictures indoor is limited. The Abbey has a nice little gift shop aat the end that is surprisingly affordable. A good spot to get some London memorabiliaA throrough visit of the Abbey will require at least 60-90 minutes"

Not having any particular attraction to old churches, we visited the Abbey mostly to see where kings, queens and other greats of the past are buried. But we were blindsided by the awesome sense of history and breathtaking architecture inside; in the end, it was the top highlight of my trip to London,You will definitely need the free audio guide, if you aren't part of a guided tour (we weren't). This walks you through and points out the highlights. You can't help but feel a sense of awe as you walk slowly through the hushed chapels and rooms, past tombs of great kings and queens and historical figures, see the places where monarchs were crowned and the throne they were crowned on.The building itself is stunning. The ceilings in particular, are breathtaking even for a non-architectural type like me. Everything in the abbey seems ornate and detailed. One can only imagine at the time, cost and effort involved to build this place, bit by bit, over the centuries. It's a marvel of a place, and I am so glad we bothered to go inside."

How anybody can say the entrance fee and the extra \u00a33 for the guided tour is too expensive is totally beyond me. 1000 years of history is here in this building, and the verger made it live for us. Not only did he take us to where 'regular' tourists cannot go (close to some of the medieval royal tombs), he was completely knowledgeable and his enthusiasm for this beautiful building and everything in it was so infectious. Everything about what makes us English is contained within its walls, from the medieval monarchs to the war heroes and poets and authors of our past all within a soaring building built to the glory of God. The medieval Cosmati pavement is permanently covered by a carpet but at the end of the tour I asked him a question about it and he took me behind the barrier and uncovered the pavement to let me see it in its glory. If you are at all interested in our history this is the most important historic building in England, and well worth seeing for its sense of history and glorification of God."

The icing on the cake of the experience was staying for Evensong and getting to sit with the Abbey choir. It was so moving that I cried a few tears of happiness, which thrilled my sweet husband. And when the service was over, we exited surrounded by the marvelous peeling of the bells. We walked over the long bridge and the bells could still be heard for blocks. What a great time!

I've read a few grumblings about the entrance fee, but in all honesty, considering the historical value of this site and the need to maintain its preservation, I feel that it is a very small price to pay for the privilege to see it. At the time of my visit there was a group of preservationists restoring a floor mosaic from the 13th century, and I can promise you that kind of work doesn't come cheap. It is worth it to me to contribute.Anyway, along with your entrance fee you get an audio tour. Definitely pick up one of these, it really adds so much more to your visit and directs your attention to important areas that you might have otherwise missed. As a history lover, I was absolutely thrilled to be standing at the graves of so many monarchs and other noteworthy individuals in British history. While the full scale of the history you will come face to face with is staggering, the absolute beauty of the place is worth seeing on its own. There was one particular chapel with a delicate stone ceiling that was just stunning.If you're going to be in London, don't leave without visiting this landmark. It's a World Heritage site for a reason."

My girlfriend and I went on the Verger Tour around the Abbey (it cost \u00a33 more) and it was one of the most enjoyable things we did on our whole holiday. The verger was intelligent, eloquent, friendly and immensely helpful. We were able to access one or two areas of the Abbey that other people are unable to get to unless they are on a verger tour (makes you feel a bit special ha ha), and every room, memorial and tomb that we saw on the tour was well explained and all questions the group had were answered well. The Abbey itself is an immense place - full of history and heritage. It is not a Cathedral and it is not the same as St. Paul's, so if you go there expecting something like St. Paul's you will be disappointed. I would also say that you should DEFINITELY go on a Verger tour as it seems to me this makes the experience so much more interesting, informative and worthwhile. Its cheap and absolutely fantastic. If your not able to do this for some reason then make you you get the audio tour, there isnt many signposts and you will definitely need some direction as well as explanation as to why things/people are important etc.If you do the verger tour, honestly, one of the best things you will do in London!"

AMAZING EXPERIENCE and I'm not even religeous. It was a reflectful calm in the storm of a whirlwind vacation. It was a highlight of all the things we did in London and something I'll never forget.

It moved me along too quickly, and I personally thought it was confusing. So, I ditched the headset, and went along on my own. I respect that photos inside the Abbey are not allowed, since its still a place of worship. But it would have been cool to bring back photos and show people my experiece. I wandered around, in amazement, because I didn't realize this was the final resting place for so many notable people! The big surprise was seeing the tomb of Queen Elizabeth I and Queen Mary of Scots. There is so much history here, and while it doesn't have the glamour of St. Pauls, it does have centuries of history. And it continues daily with the services offered. Pretty cool to me. Also, as I was walking along one of the corridors, I found a very modern tribute to the soliders of WWII. It was cool to see such a modern object along centuries old walls."

The people who are buried here are not all Anglicans. Many of them were not even good Christians, but they all made a contribution to British government, society, or culture in some way that bears remembering. I love that about this place. I suppose a visit to this vast church could be a religious experience for some, but I just found it to be spiritual in that it offers a profound sense of the continuity of human history and achievement. I was moved by the opportunity to stand at the grave of Elizabeth I, one of the most remarkable women of all time. I was also impressed that the Abbey proudly houses the tombs of several scientists whose works are considered by some to be in conflict with Christianity. That, to me, was the ultimate beauty of this place. Come here to be impressed by a connection to history, and you will not be disappointed. Oh, and by the way- despite the comments of a previous reviewer, Henry VIII is not buried here. You'll find him at Windsor Castle. His daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I are here. So, too, are his son Edward VI and his short-term wife Anne of Cleaves, but that's it for the Tudor family."

Yes, it's tombs and monuments make it a \"Who's Who\" of British history and culture... and yes, it is an impressive building. But, frankly, I would not list it anywhere near the top of my list of the most awe-inspiring churches and cathedrals that I have seen in the course of many years of travel. I felt that the admission price of 15 pounds (nearly $50 US for the 2 of us) was overpriced. Never in my life have I paid such a price to visit a church. Is the Anglican Church milking the Abbey for all it's worth, or have they set the admission so high in hopes of cutting down on the high tourist volume? If the later is the case, it hasn't helped. Which brings me to my next complaint, the abbey is so jammed with tourists (you truly have to squeeze through the crowds in some tight spots) that you lose the sense of being in a church. Finally, I am very respectful of restrictions on photography in churches... after all it is a place of worship. But after paying that admission price, and seeing the hordes of visitors trooping through the place, the restriction seemed ridiculous. Non-flash photography would not have distracted one iota from its dignity (or lack thereof)."

We arrived there around 3pm and supposedly they closed around 4pm or so - however, once you're in, they will allow you to stay in and finish your tour. Since we were there in April, there were no summer crowds, so we went through the entire place in about 2 hours.I recommend the audio tour cause it will give you an idea of everything you are looking at and the history behind from the alter, the throne and each room. There are many famous people either buried or paid tribute to throughout the abbey including some unexpected folks, such as Sir Isaac Newton. It took some time to reach many of the plaques on the walls and floors.A few other things to note: there is no photography or filming in the abbey, so just enjoy it with your own eyes. There is an entrance fee and I don't think there are any coupons out there. I heard that you can get in for free to watch the Evensong performance which is when the choir sings around 5pm on certain days of the week. That was recommended to us, but we didn't have time to go during this performance. The abbey is also very close to Parliament, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery, London Eye and Downing Street, so it gives you a chance to check out other places nearby in the same trip."

I managed to cram 31 attractions and three plays into two weeks, and still this came out on top. The key part was paying the extra 4 pounds for the Verger led tour, which took about 90 minutes and gave all sorts of commentary and insights, as well as taking our small group of about 6 people \"behind the scenes\" and showing photos of the inside of the Abbey when it was remodeled for Queen Elizabeth's Coronation. One of my favorite parts was being led upstairs into Edward the Confessor's Chapel, which is off limits to the public now because of its fragile state. It was amazing to hear how the different parts of the Abbey tie together, and I would have missed all the details pointed out to us if I had just had the audio. And they let you actually sit in the stalls of the Quire, another part that is off limits to the public--and the people watching looked quite jealous.So my two cents are: go early, there was no line there when it opened on a Friday morning, so no need to queue up before it opens, just get there at the start. But it rapidly became crowded, so by the end of my two hour visit it was pretty packed. Pay for the Verger tour, definitely. And I'd say that even if you wander around at a leisurely pace, two hours gives you a good, in depth view of the Abbey."

I have mixed feelings about charging to go into a place of worship, but if you see it as a visit to a sight, then it is the average charge to a large scale historical monument. If you are used to being able to visit museums and cathedrals free of charge you may feel this charge is too high. However, if you want to see the tombs of so many famous people of history it is the place to go. The Lady Chapel is stunning and clearly just restored. The Abbey operates a flow system as well as a free audio guide, so you will find key numbers for different parts of the building to tap into your audio guide. As the building is clearly under continuous restoration the audio guide hints that certain parts of the building are sometimes closed because of it. There wasn't much closed for us although there were restorers working on the mosaics in front of the high altar. If you really want value for money, attend choral evensong when it is free and you can get to sit in the choir stalls themselves."

I would recommend the audioguide as well, it points out a lot of things you wouldn't otherwise notice. This place is just crammed with stories and a guide or book are necessary to fully appreciate it. Its also a good idea to show up for the Evensong (usually at 4:30). Its generally crowded, but there aren't many times where you could avoid that.

I arrived just as it opened at 9:30 in the morning and paid 4 pounds extra for the verger led tour. It was definitely worth it because you can only see the Confessor's Shrine on the verger led tours. This area had the oldest and most beautiful tombs of the kings and queens of England. The verger was very informative and I learned a lot more about the abbey from him than from just the audio-guide. He also led us to other places in the abbey that the public can't just enter by themselves. I loved every minute of the five hours I spent there. Yes, I was there for five hours. The verger guided tour was about an hour and a half. Then I took the self guided tour and after that I visited the abbey museum. Don't forget to go to this museum. Inside you can see the funeral effigies of some of the kings and queens as well as a duplicate set of the Crown jewels which were made for Queen Mary II. I will never forget this incredible place. It was one of my most favorite places that I went to on my London trip. I can't wait to go there again on my next trip there."

Do not expect a serene and peaceful church! I've been to quite a few famous churches across the world (St. Peter's in Rome, St. Paul's in London, Notre Dame in Paris and Montreal) but Westminster Abbey is still at the top of my list as one of the best.

While St. Paul's Cathedral is probably more visually appealing with its white and gold interior, neither it nor any other structure comes close to the history housed within the walls of Westminster Abbey. I was appalled by the review that suggested that tourists look at the outside and pass up the tour of the interior because it costs a few pounds. You may as well tell a child that you are taking them to Disney World, and then you take a picture of the parking lot gates. The museums of Great Britain are free because they are supported by government monies. These cathedrals are maintained by tourist dollars and donations. It gave one reviewer the creeps to walk among so many tombs; I felt blessed to be among the remains and spirits of such renowned and revered historical figures. I found it ironic and touching that Elizabeth I is buried directly across from her arch-enemy and cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots. Poet's Corner was like a trip through my high school and college literature courses; every British name of renown seemed to be represented. I heartily and warmly encourage all those who have an affinity for history and literature to visit this place. It is not a gloomy mausoleum or a spooky chamber of horrors; rather, it is a walk among the spirits of England's great and glorious past where the famous and infamous rest in peace, with their souls now revealed to none but their creator."

It's very impressive and \"atmospheric\" .When time came to enter, I realised that inside area was even more moving and special. Every single corner, even the smallest detail of the Abbey has an history to say! Every single tomb, every single statue, every picture, every item!I took an audio guide which was one of the most informative guides I used during my visit to London, and believe me, I used a lot of them in various attractions!It's not easy to describe how beautiful and intresting W.Abbey is, and the feelings you get when you are actually there... It's like you get a taste of history its self just by been in the Abbey and stand among all those tombs and statues and stuff.It definately worths the entrance fee, and there are always plenty of Abbey people around you, willing to offer information and advice. I am not a religious person at all, but just looking at their calm faces and listening to their polite way of speaking, I felt sort of inspired of these people!Next time I come to London, I will visit again to take a guided tour with a member of staff that time.If you have the slightest interest on history, don't miss Westminster Abbey!!!"

I suppose not too many native Londoners have stepped foot inside, which I really think is a shame because it's incredible. Of course we live in New York and I have never been to the Statue of Liberty, so maybe we are even. Anyway, I went to the Abbey expecting nothing more than an old church but left feeling enchanted and haunted by the history and beauty of it.Get there early, they have short hours: 10:30 to 4:00 pm. We were completely unprepared for this, thinking any place would be open until at least 5 and we showed up at 3:00 so we really had to hurry to see everything. You definitely want to set aside a few hours for this place if not a half-day.That said, it was amazing. When we walked in there was beautiful angelic singing coming from a boy's choir that filled the whole place, beautiful old latin hymns that transported us back in time a few centuries. As you listen you can walk through and see the tombs of kings and queens that span a thousand years. Among those buried there are Laurence Olivier, Charles Dickens, Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. We walked around for a bit but ended up sneaking onto a tour already in progress because the tour guide was so enigmatic and a complete character. He told fascinating stories about each tomb and the hall of flags making sure to leave in the bawdy and vulnerably human bits. Dark and bloody history with so many complicated plot-lines I can't get it all straight, but the place definitely feels alive with ghosts of great men.One of the most interesting things to see was the coronation chair, where all the kings of England were crowned. On it there is graffiti that is hundreds of years old, carved into the chair by mischievous choir boys when no one was looking. It was interesting to see something so contemporary and relate-able on an ancient relic as 17th century graffiti. We sat at the pews when the choir began Gregorian chanting and it was incredibly meditative, I wished that we could stay and listen but they began to shoo us out since it was almost 4pm and closing time. Next time I will reserve more time to soak it all in. ...And I would even recommend it even to a skeptical Londoner."

Also of note, and quite a surprise to me, was the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, which I believe to be the first of its kind in the world.

With so many buried inside, there are spectacular memorials to loved ones buried inside, and they are everywhere on the walls, in little hide-a-way rooms and in the floor. The overall size of the building is overwhelming, but as you make your way through the magnificent memorial carvings and sculptures, you come across the burial places of kings and queens, even Mary, Queen of Scots, and her cousin, Elizabeth, who eventually had her killed. Poets' Corner has some unbelievable names, and we even found the burial place in the floor of Charles Darwin.

The list of famous personages that are buried or memorialized there would require a great deal of space and can be found elsewhere on the Internet. (Try Wikipedia.)As a place of worship, however, it's a sad commentary on the state of religion in England. Lots of great monuments to kings, queens, unknown nobles and war dead, virtually nothing about saints or those who provided models of Christian virtue (excepting the statues far atop one of the entrances--you might miss them if someone didn't point them out). You are not allowed to visit the tomb of St. Edward the Confessor (who was also a king--I guess that's how he made it in) which might provide you with some connection to Christianity. Memorials to John and Charles Wesley--which might appeal to some Methodist tourists perhaps--were cordoned off and had folding chairs and tables stacked against them. I guess these guys are still not popular with Anglicans. Overall the Abbey is a fascinating study of how power and privilege usurped a place of honor in a religion that is supposed to be dedicated to the service of \"the least of these.\"Finally, you really need to get the audio tour because the \"docents\" are clueless."

Westminster Abbey\u201cSpectacular, Utterly, Breathtaking\u201dOne of the greatest examples of Medieval Architecture known to man, this place is a wellspring of beauty and historical depth. I first glimpsed Westminster whilst touring the city on a bus with my parents, immediately I was struck by its sheer beauty and when I actually got to see it up close, and saw the magnificence of its interior, I was ensnared by its marvelous wonder. Even now I find myself fondly remembering the time spent within the abbey as a great and wondrous experience which has become a highlight of my young life. I visited Westminster during my family\u2019s trip to London in the summer of 2005, and the excursion soon became one of the highlights of the entire stay. We got tickets ahead of time, so we were able to bypass a lot of the lines, but we still had to wait a considerable amount of time. We spent most of it gazing at the utterly beautiful exterior (one of the pinnacles of Medieval Gothic Architecture) and trying to name the apostles and old-testament prophets commemorated on the archway. Once inside we were immediately struck by its sheer wonder and stunned by the beauty of the expanse. However, I must say that the greatest and most impressive feature of the Abbey was the tombs.Although it may sound morbid, I was fascinated by standing in the burial place of so many great men and women during my visit to Westminster Abbey. Being obsessed with the great annals of History (particularly that of the continent of Europe) the tombs had a great impact upon me, and I was awed at being surrounded by the bodies and the spirits of so many great men and women. We visited the tombs of Henry V, Henry VII, Charles Darwin, General Wolfe, Elizabeth I, and so many other monarchs, poets, scientists and generals, all of which were splendid and would defy any attempts to describe them.Even without the vault of historical knowledge encapsulated by the tombs Westminster is still a magnificent place. It is here that you can gaze upon the coronation chamber, where almost all of the English Monarchs were officially crowned, from Edward the Confessor of the Saxon line, to Elizabeth II Windsor. Occasionally you can also see the Stone of Scone, where the kings and queens of Scotland are Crowned (although as of 4/18/08 it is still in Scotland), as well as countless other items of royal significance. Or failing any of those, you could just simply gaze upon the wondrous and captivating spectacle of the Abbey itself. Another great quality of the abbey is it doesn\u2019t actually cost much to get in (\u20a410.00 for adults or \u20a426.00 for a family of four), although concessions and tours do cost additional fees. Overall, I would highly recommend it as one of the greatest sites in this fabulous city. Should I ever find myself in London again, I will make sure to visit this wondrous structure once again, and bask in the beauty that is Westminster."

We insisted on going in (we knew it was free on Sunday) and the usher asked us if we were able to stay for the FULL service..we said yes (although I knew I was lying:)Me and my two friends walked in (yeeees, freee) and a few more Abbey employees showed us to our seats. The service was held at the very end of the building, by the ALTAR. Never in my wildest dreams had I hoped to sit there (for 30 minutes!). I believe it was that location where the Queen and Royal Court must be seated during ceremonies. There were 6 rows of chairs for the people at the service (3 rows on each side of the altar). I was asked to sit in one of the three chairs in the first row. It was INSANE. The pastor was about 2-3 meters from me. The Cathedral was semi-dark, with the altar part well lit. It was SOOOOOO QUIET! That's the difference between going inside on a crowded visitor day and going in during a service. All the time, I felt like I was part of a small, secret society, inside this huge, misterious Cathedral. We were given a booklet with the sermon and songs we were supposed to sing (I didn't, I am not Episcopalian). I stared at the ceiling, the arches, the windows, the mosaic floor (black and white). I felt both oppresses and impressed by the place and the service. This is where Queens and Kings have walked by. Where my feet were resting it's where a King's feet have rested. ROYAL atmosphere, from beginning to end of this \"twilight zone\" service and experience. Like in the 1001 nights story, when for 1 day you can exchange places with the king."

The impressive history and architecture warrants at least a two-hour visit to take the verger tour or an audio tour, longer if you have the time. I visited on July 7, 2007, the first day of the Tour de France. Plan to arrive before opening (9:30); many of the smaller rooms in the Abbey can get really crowded later on in the day. Admission is 7 pounds for students and 10 pounds for adults. Unfortunately, the verger tour was not scheduled until 10:30, so I decided to take the 5-pound audio tour instead of waiting around for an hour. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, since the audio tour approached the quality of a human tour guide, and I normally don't like audio tours. The tour goes through every area of the Abbey accessible to the public. Every part of the building's history is covered, from the early Medieval monks' cloisters to the parts of the Abbey damaged during World War II. Of course, the Abbey contains thousands of graves and memorials of famous people, including numerous monarchs, war heroes, and literary figures. One highlight is the coronation chair, which no longer holds the Stone of Scone. The tour is about 90 minutes long, but can be made longer by several optional sections that give more detailed information; it is well worth the 5 pounds. The Abbey museum about halfway through contains several artifacts and is a good source of information.The only drawbacks to visiting Westminster Abbey are the high cost and the fact that cameras are not allowed inside. That being said, this is one of the greatest churches in the world, and one of the coolest places I have visited in Europe (or anywhere else). Any minor quibbles are greatly outweighed by the experience."

FYI it gets dark at 4:30 pm and that is when we tried to visit Westminster Abbey. No pics came out because of the dark, plus all the tours were finishing because of the winter hours and the approaching evensong. So we decided to attend the service. Well lets us just say that all four of us were moved by the worship service. All male choir filled the centuries old cathedral and we became a part of a very untouristy part of Abbey life/English life. It was our first major stop/sight in London and even though we did not have the usual Abbey experience the evensong jump started us to truly tap in to all things English."

Frankly, the shock of history hit me in the face when I read that many parts of the abbey were built in the 1200\u2019s and I was walking where others walked 800 years ago. The gift shop is nothing special and probably overpriced. They did have a good range of prices on their souvenirs from inexpensive to very expensive.

The label has the Westminster Abbey logo on it.Second, they have a wonderful array of gift items that aren't the usual lot you find in London. There are small pieces of window ware (Stained glass) that are copies of some of the windows you will see at the abbey and of course other famous churches in England (Such as the rose window). Lots of lovely postcards (a necessity as you can't take photos around the grounds) and many other little \"treasures.\"So do stop by on your way, and if you can, get a little jar of jam. You will adore it when you return home and have a taste of England in your cupboard."

The building and grounds are very large and visitors should plan at least two hours. Inside are some of England's most influential monarchs going back 1000 years to Edward the Confessor, Elizabeth I, and many others. Besides the monarchs, the floor is almost entirely tombs of other important people in England and Britain. There is much stained glass, and the main building of the abbey is surprisingly bright. The tour is self guided, and different areas and tombs have good explanations. The grounds are quite large, and standard admission does not buy access to all areas. The oldest parts of the abbey do require an additional fee, and these areas should not be missed. There is no crypt or towerto climb, or at least none open to the public. Plan at least two hours inside. The snack stand serves surprisingly good soup and sandwiches. There is no climbing, but many small steps."

It is expensive, but think of what it costs to keep up a place of this magnitude (just a few years ago it was blackened by coal dust, now its as clean as when it was new). Plus, with what you've already spent to get to and stay in London, you should not miss a place that is really the soul of the country you are visiting.While at the abbey, be sure to take the verger tour. There are huge crowds at the abbey and the audio or book tour can not overcome feeling that there are just too many people..With the verger, you go to areas not open to the general public, get some personal attention and receive a somewhat offbeat appreciation for British history through the long line of kings buried at the Abbey (you can pick up those you miss here by going to Windsor....you'll find George III and Henry VIII here, as well as the more recent monarchs). I have taken the verger tour at Westminister Abbey twice, and both were incredibly entertaining. They make the stones come alive.I also recommend getting to the site early (the lines to get in are long), going to the Chapter House and seeing the museum. In the museum you will find effigies of various monarchs used in funeral processions (preservation hundreds of years ago was poor and the King/Queen would not hold up well enough for the state funeral)."

When you enter the abbey, it is easy to get struck by it's impressive grandeur. The architecture is, quite simply, awe-inspiring. Walking amongst the tombs of Edward the Confessor and Elizabeth (amongst others), you definitely feel the rich history. But it is not only a final home to kings; within it's walls are also monuments to other notables such as William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Issac Newton, Charles Darwin, and perhaps most poignantly the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier."

The history and architecture are amazing and there is just far too much to see and take in even in the 2 hours. We arrived at opening (which is a great idea as you will beat the larger crowds that gather as the day wears on). As it turned out, the first Verger tour did not start until 10:30am, so we bought tickets for it, left for about 1/2 hour and walked over to the Houses of Parliament for an up-close look at the buildings before heading back for our tour. (Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament are extremely close). Glad we waited for the Verger tour - it was fabulous and a must do if you can afford the extra 4 GBP per person. Considering you are paying so much for entry, the extra 4 pounds probably won't hurt too bad - and I cannot emphasize enough how excellent this tour is. The Verger takes you into a few areas that are inaccessible to all other tourists. An expensive \"tourist\" attraction to say the least considering it is a church, but one of those places that you really must see if visiting London. We paid a total of 24 GBP for one adult (10), one senior (6), and the verger tour for both (8). The verger took us into the shrine of Edward the Confessor - a spot only accessible with a Verger. Since we were with a Verger, we also got to stop and sit in the church's nave pews (blocked to all others) where the choir sit, where he gave us more history. The stop to sit was very welcomed as there is a lot of walking. The additional areas that were accessible with a Verger as well as his indepth knowledge of the Abbey truly made this a highlight for me. Apparently, Westminster Abbey refused to let any of the DaVinci Code movie be shot inside the Abbey, and the shots they used of Newton's monument were from pictures, not the actual monument in the Abbey."

I may be the only tourist who wouldn't call Westminster Abbey a must-see, but I thought I'd register my opinion in case there are other tourists who would feel the way I do. I went to the Abbey with my husband, a history fiend. Unlike my husband, I don't have that much feeling for history. It was certainly impressive to stand so near the mortal remains of so many kings and queens, but I admit it also felt a bit creepy. There are lots of nobles buried here as well, some of whose monuments are surely impressive. Poet's Corner was nice too. The church and its stained-glass windows are attractive. Overall, though, I found the Abbey a bit underwhelming for the ticket price of \u00a310, and I wish I hadn't spent as much time as I did here. I'm not saying I would have spent it at Madam Tussaud's or Harrod's, which to me are also overrated. I would have preferred to spend the money on a theatre ticket, and the time on a more thorough tour of the British Library, the British Museum, or any of the art museums I visited.In retrospect, after reading some of the reviews here, I might have done better to try and attend religious services on Sunday. I do respect the fact that the Abbey is still a working church, with prayers once every hour. I just feel that it should be approached in a spirit of reverence rooted in religious faith or a love of history or architecture. I was horrified to see a bored group of French schoolchildren !!scratching absently at the paint on some of the memorials!! The Abbey's roles as national monument, working church, and blockbuster tourist attraction just don't go very well together."

The banners form a virtual menagerie of animals, weaponry, peculiar symbols, colorful flags and coats of arms. .A more modern historical tidbit which kids can search for in Westminster Abbey is a tiny hole in the wall at the back of the Lady Chapel.
