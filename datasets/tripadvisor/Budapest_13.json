This is definitely the defining building of Budapest, and the open area around it is nice, too. Take some photos with it next to the Danube, and maybe even with the cruise ships nearby; it's a fantastic photo opportunity!"

Seeing it from the water is something we recommend, and we believe that there are dinner cruises or sightseeing cruises you can take. Tip: if you want to tour the inside, you must plan ahead. Parliament must be in recess, and there are limited and timed tours if you want an English guide. Go to the website and pre-arrange prior to your arrival."

It is advisable to book a 50-minute guided tour beforehand via e-mail jegymesterKft so that you will not be disappointed. If you are an EU citizen tickets are discounted at HUF 2000 + HUF 200 for admin.services.The outside richly decorated architecture is stunning and impressive. The inside is a precious gem decorated in gold. The tour guide explained the history of the building and its present use. If you are not familiar with public transportation taxis are not that expensive and very reasonable. From Corinthia Hotel to House of Parliament we paid HUf 2000 depending on traffic.Many a times when we wanted to go places we either went by walk or by taxi.This is a MUST-SEE attraction. Do not miss!!!"

I did book a tour in the evening and it was a quick 30mins tour of inside parts of parliament. As a Non-EU citizen the ticket prices were expensive and I wouldn't recommend it as the tour was fast. Don't get me wrong the inside of the building is lovely and great architecture however if you're not so fussed on the specs then just the outside of the building is fine."

It's modelled on the British Parliament but is bigger than it. Dark red and white, with cathedral-like characteristics, it's bound to take your breath away. And in front of it, two decidedly embarrassed looking guards march round and round the Hungarian flag, much to the amusement of tourists. They try hard not to smile, but they're only too human. The parks and landscaping outside the Parliament provides plenty of opportunities to sit quietly in the beautiful surroundings and take it all in. Guided tours of the Parliament are also available."

It's about a 15 minute walk from the Intercontinental hotel but should allow about 30 minutes walk time to find the tourist entrance and where to line-up. The lines to get into security are a mess. Signage is poor and the language barrier makes it hard to understand where/when you should get in line If your ticket is printed for 10:30, they will not let you in at 10:25. Once inside, it is fantastic. The tour is about an hour and you can take pictures except in the room where the Hungarian crown is displayed. One woman tried to sneakily take some pictures and a guard came over and made her delete the pictures she took. Hah!"

Situated outside Kossuth Lajos Ter station (it is difficult not to miss it), the building has an imposing appearance and also features a changing of the guard near to the flag in front of the building. Tours are available to book both online and at the building itself. I would avoid using the online site since it is the Hungarian version of Ticketmaster (Jegymester) and often doesn't work or offers tickets at a more expensive price than they are at the building. Additionally, if you want to book a tour on the day, remember to take your passport with you since this will be checked when you go through the barriers to the tour (along with your bags). The tour is fantastic, you will see the insides of the building itself including the main hall where politicians meet. However, the highlight of the tour is seeing the crown worn by the kings of Hungary. Be aware that whilst photography is permitted in all other areas of the building, you are not permitted to take any pictures whatsoever of the crown (the tour guides do remind you repeatedly for your benefit, but there is always one). Take a tour and discover Hungary's Parliament."

You purchase tickets in an area you walk down a ramp to get below ground to. It's on the back left side of the building when you are facing it from the river. The guided tours are scheduled by time and language. Get there early so you can purchase tickets as they only have a certain amount of slots for each tour in language and sometimes tickets can go fast if there is a large group wanting a certain tour. We purchased ours and had to come back a couple hours later. You are able to take pictures inside, except for the Holy Roman Emperor Crown that's on display and being guarded. The room where Parliament actually meets is stunning. The tour was very well done and informative regarding history of the building and area. For those with difficulty walking, they do have an elevator that can be used. Very happy we decided to do this. Highlight of our trip to Budapest."

No visitor can miss the iconic building on the Danube. It's beautiful in the daylight, but makes an even more spectacular sight in the evening. We thought the best spot for night time pictures were the steps at the Fisherman's Bastion across the river on Castle Hill in Buda. But in my opinion, to get the full experience, a tour of the interior is really worth the money. To secure a spot on a tour in the language of your choice, it's a good idea to reserve a spot online, especially during the busier summer months. We booked our tour about a month in advance. The exclusive website to do book is \"jegymester.hu\" and the entire process can be completed in English. You can print your tickets out at home and go directly to the security line when you arrive. It gave me peace of mind to know that we had guaranteed tickets. The tour entry is inside a modern underground entrance in Kossuth Lajos square. If you weren't able to secure tickets for the day of your visit, I would still check at the visitor office for same day tickets. The day of our visit, additional tours were added. Our tour guide was very engaging and informative. She was very proud of her country and history and excited to share. Each member of our tour group got to wear a transmitter/ear phones, so it was easy to hear the tour guide, even if you weren't right in the front of the group. In addition, photography was allowed everywhere except around the crown. The tour took about 45 minutes. The inside of the building was absolutely beautiful, just like the outside, and well worth a visit. One last note: Don't miss the changing of the guard ceremony that takes place outside the main hall on the hour. It's much less grand than the one in England, but after the guards finish their formal exchange, they march into the crowd for pictures with tourists."

On the garden front, you can enjoy great architecture of huge parliament house and other old government buildings and some other monuments nearby. Whats interesting is you will find also 2 guards keep walking around the majestic flag or even better you will see some other guards coming for shift change ceremony (I heard they change the shift every hour but I did not verify this information -fortunately we were there when they change shift-). The riverfront is not very special in the daylight but become beautiful if you see it during sunset. You should take a sunset boat to see the best of it."

Upon buying tickets a saleswoman checked our ID cards (a little bit strange situation for me). To go inside with english group we had to wait for 3 hours. Fortunately we could go somewhere else (recommend to visit St. Stephen's Basilica). After three hours we went back and started to visit parliament. It is possible to see only the half of the building (southern?) because the second part is used by hungarian deputies ;-). The most impressives are two places inside: the dome with St Stephen's crown and deputies room (routinely not used).After 45 minutes we went out. Taken together it is not a waste of time but I was not impressed (except mentioned places)."

Like almost everyone else who visits this wonderful city you view the Parliament Building located on the eastern bank of the River Danube and standing on Kossuth Lajos Square to the rear. This massively impressive building, very similar, and believed to be based, on the Houses of Parliament building in London, was completed in 1904 and originally housed two parts of the National Assembly of Hungary but now that legislature is unicameral it occupies only part leaving much of the building vacant but able to be viewed by Hungarians and the city visitors. Built in a Gothic Revival style the building is truly wonderful and can be viewed from all around but probably best from a river boat on the River Danube. In the evening it is lit up and forms the main part of Budapest's wonderful skyline. I was intrigued by the building. It really is beautiful."

It has been restored well after the stonework started to crumble. It is well worth taking a tour of this building which can be booked online to save queuing. On the tour the extraordinary history is explained from the first King (St Stephen) to present day (No longer a House of Lords). In the central dome area, which is heavily guarded, the gold crown worn by the kings and one queen can be viewed.It is also well worth doing a boat trip at night to see this building and many others splendidly lit up."

The inside is absolutely stunning! Based on the design of our own Parliament building in London, it is gilt covered and opulent and contains the holy crown on Hungary (which is the only place you cannot take photos). There are a few steps to manage, but our party included two wheelchair users who were taken via lift - so don't be put off. The building is as impressive inside as out."

Guided tours are offered in many different languages though the times for specific languages do not appear to be consistent from day to day, therefore, I would suggest arriving early in the day to see what the options are. Tickets can be ordered in advance online, however, the times listed on the website did not match the actual times shown in the visitors center. Ticket prices depend on your nationality. EU citizens pay half that of non-EU citizens. As mentioned above, the tour is not particularly long though you do get to see one of the main hallways, the main entrance stairway, the central dome and parliament chambers. At each location, the guide provides some relevant information. Overall, I would recommend the building and tour to those interested in government, history and architecture."

            "review": "Beautiful building with interesting history. This building is the one that you always seem to see in pictures of Budapest, right on the riverfront with its grand facade and dome it is now emblematic of the city. It is based on the British Parliament building and retains some of that history - there are two debating chambers, one each for the Commons and the Lords. Since Hungary now only needs one chamber, however, the Lords section is no longer needed politically so is used for this tour. The general impression is that this building is much grander and more opulent than its British counterpart (I speak as a Brit).There can be a bit of a wait to get in. Different languages each have their own tour which follow each other around. If yours is the last to get in then you must wait while the others go through the airport-type security checks first. Fair enough I think, this is the Hungarian seat of government after all. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and helpful so everything was explained as we went round.You will get to see the magnificent main staircase, the dome (where the 'crown jewels' are kept), the Lords' lounges and their debating chamber. You can take photographs anywhere except the crown jewels - the light levels around them needs to be controlled carefully. There is an exhibition on the architecture and history of the building as you leave so you should allow about two hours for the whole visit.In summary an interesting visit to make inside this beautiful building, but I'd advise against taking very young children - they would find the initial security a bit worrying and rest of the visit boring. For older children, teens and adults, however, there is plenty of interesting stuff to see."

We turned up relativity early one morning and joined the queue to buy tickets for the next English speaking tour. Unfortunately it was very popular and booked out while we were queuing so we had to book onto the next, which was in the early afternoon. It was definitely worth the wait, as the building is very impressive from the inside and we were talked through a lot of useful information about the building and Hungary's politics.There is a lift which those less mobile are able to use, but otherwise quite an easy walk around a spectacular building.Advice - either pre-book online or turn up early for tickets!"

The Parliament building is the second largest (England has the largest) and awesomely pretty at all times of day and in any weather. It's very tastefully lit at night to show every detail, spire and gargoyle, (hundreds of birds circling above, probably eating bugs attracted by the lights). Truly an incredible sight, but then it's beautiful in the daylight as well. Sunset gives its white stone a pinkish cast (or reds or orange depending on the colors of the sunset). My favorite pictures are just before dawn with the pink and deep violet sky behind the silhouette of its spires and main dome. Take time to make reservations for a tour in your choice of language. Also beautiful and interesting. Go into the meeting halls (if parliament is not in session). See King/Saint Steven's crown and other ceremonial jewels and garb. Don't miss the brass cigar holders with numbers so members can park their unfinished stogies when they have to go back in session (probably not used with the current smoking laws)."

It is such an amazing structure from every angle both day and night. In the afternoon towards the evening time frame it is best to view it from across the river up in the Castle area. Up close, I suggest going there early in the morning where it is not crowded. There is a nice breakfast place just outside of the subway station and you can admire the building while enjoying your coffee. I could not leave my breakfast table when I realized that there was a flag raising ceremony right in front of the Parliament. It was a short ceremony. As I did not have any advance reservation to enter the building, I just browse through their gift shop as they have books relating to the building. Going back to the subway, take the next stop crossing the river and when you get out you are right across the Parliament building, however, since it was early morning, it was not a good picture taking opportunity. (Tip: you can take the tram going south that passes by to take you to the foot of the funicular that takes you up the Castle/st Mathias church - or walk)."

We waited in a very long, slightly disorganized line for over an hour to purchase tickets for later that afternoon. I will also point out that they kindly show the number of ticket available in each time tour slot. But in reality this serves only to make you anxious as you watch the number of tickets in your desired tour group language and/or time disappear. When we returned, the tour started promptly. We were walked through a total of four rooms and a stairway. You start by climbing up the gold-plated stairway, very cool,\u2014then see the entrance main stairway before being led into the Dome room, where the crown of St. Stephen is housed. There are strangely no photos allowed in here. Then you see the press lobby and the upper house. The tour doesn't take long, but the guide was fairly informative. It was a good rainy-day activity for us while we visited Budapest, but I think most people would be just as happy with photos of the outside of the building. Also, we happened to catch the changing of the guard outside at noon, which was very cute."

It is not inexpensive for non-EU citizens, however, and is a bit dry, but worth the price to get to see the extravagant interior.

As other reviewers have said, do book your guided tour in advance; ours was at 12.00 and we heard those turning up on the spot beng sent away. You can't just wander round on your own.It is huge, gilded to the eyebrows and spectacular. The centrepiece is the golden coronation crown with its leaning cross on top, and the orb, sceptre and ceremonial sword, guarded by very tall soldiers from a special and distinguished army unit who stand with drawn swords. The impressive legislative chamber combines lavish decorative features with state of the art voting facilities. Outside the chamber can be seen quantities of curiously ridged brass objects which are cigar holders from an earlier era when nembers could nip outside for a quick gasp, leaving their cigar to be returned to later.It was a most interesting visit, and as we walked away across the courtyard the changing of the national flag's guard took place. Very smart and reminiscent of old film footage of bygone empires, not exactly goose-stepping but on the way to it. The guards' official issue sunglasses added an extra air of menace."

Even if you don't, this building is the first one you see if you're looking at pictures of Budapest. It is big, and it is beautiful. The inside is also amazing, with acres of gold leaf, beautiful sculptures, and marble corridors. You should definitely visit. Just be sure to reserve your tickets online at least a day before you go -- there may not be any available if you wait until the day of your visit. You can only visit with a tour, and they have frequent tours in English. The tours are businesslike and rushed, but they give a good orientation. In the basement there is an enjoyable exhibit about the building's construction in the late 19th century. While you're there, take the time to find the moving 1956 memorial in the grounds (it's underground), It will definitely affect you. Don't miss this building if you're in Budapest."

Nonetheless, the tour guide was excellent and once we were through security she took care of everything.

It starts with a walk up a staircase that was 130 steps broken in several segments. It was beautiful with the gold leaf and murals. We went to the grand entrance which was equally as beautiful. The tour also visits assembly hall where the Hungarian legislature conducts session. Again, very impressive. The most impressive part of the tour was the ability to see and learn about the Hungarian Crown. Our tour was sold out. We bought our tickets the day we toured and they printed them for us at the visitor center."

The Parliament building dominates the near Pest side of the Danube, not far from the Chain Bridge and it is awe inspiring especially at night from the Castle District in as it is lighted and looks more like a castle. . The modern underground visitor center has an interesting historical exhibit. There is a Lapidarium exhibit and extensive grounds. Tours (about $ 20 per person) of the interior including seeing the ancient Hungarian Royal crown and the throne, the changing of the guard on the half hour, the assembly chamber and some of the unbelievably ornate corridors with vaulted decorated ceilings and stained glass windows. Our tour guide, however, was very disappointing in that she spoke softly, didn't wait I til the large group gathered around and spoke towards what she was describing rather than towards her group. This made it almost impossible to understand what she was saying with no amplification or ability to project her voice. The tour was advertised as being 45 minutes long, but by the time the groups were assembled (by language), and we got through metal detectors, we barely were in the building for half an hour. There are also 140 steps from the u nderground Visitor Center to the main level and back down,so using the one lift may be a good option for some. Perhaps the most beautiful Parliament building and the third largest in the world, but one of the worst tours ever."

There's great photo opportunities to be had by day and night. The evening around 6 or 7 is particularly good as the lighting is great and there's hardly any tourists left wondering around. The tour itself was on the expensive side and the 45 minutes went pretty quickly while walking the length of many of the corridors. The tour guide was polite, funny and informative. As for toilets, don't pay for them inside, next to the cafe. Just outside they are free!"

The modern visitors' center makes the logistics of a tour of the Parliament building simple, and the tour itself is spectacular. We took a guided tour in English, using the remote headsets that allow you to hear the guide's comments as long as you are in proximate range. When his voice started to break up - it meant it was time to stop gawking and get moving!! But, there was so much to gawk at! The interior is wonderful, with complex and sophisticated late 19th century decorations in revival Gothic and Renaissance styles. The tour includes a stop in the breathtaking dome room, where the crown of St. Stephen is on display. That experience - being in that space, and being close to that artifact - is worth the price of admission in an of itself. Then, you get to see the incredibly ornate assembly hall, as well as other impressive interior spaces and views out the windows across the Danube. Wonderful!After finishing the tour of the building proper, the tour lets out into a very well-done and very informative gallery of information about the building, with many great videos, animations, and other impressive didactics. I loved this part of the tour - extremely well done!All in all, I would say a trip to Budapest could not be complete without a visit to this historic and beautiful building."

We had pre-booked our tickets which seemed to save time at the entrance area which was very busy. You have to go through the usual security as you would expect with a parliament buidling. The tour turned out to be really fascinating. The guide was amusing and informative without droning on. The building was mind-blowingly beautiful. Rich, guilded, well decorated corridors, rooms and staircases were all explained as well as one of the parliament chambers. The building offers photo opportunities aplenty. The tour is quite cheap too (for EU states) and well worth the money. This is one of the highlights of a Budapest trip. Definitely recommended."

This iconic building is often feature in adverts for European river cruises, and it is not surprising when one actually sees it. Overlooking the Danube, the facade needs to be seen from several angles, so don't just walk around it it, visit Buda and see it from the Fisherman's Bastion, and then take a night cruise along the river and see it lit up. It really is stunning.It is at the rear on Parliament Square that the action happens, and if you time it well, you will see the changing of the guard. The square also contains a number of older buildings and a couple of museums. Wander around the square and take in the history. Som of the buildings still have the bullet scars and there is an underground museum dedicate to the 1956 revolution."

It's nice to get a bit of history and the tour man we had looked professional (in a suit) and the mic they have means you can hear them clearly (always a worry when you're in a tour group). Nice thing to do in Hungary - make sure you book in advance though!It's not a \"rock up on the day\" type tour."

Must carry your passport and immerse yourself in this nice tour. The \" Shoes Memorial\" is close by which should be visited too. There is a change of guard every hour too. So enjoy your tour of this third largest Parliament in the world."

I recommend taking the time to go through the small museum either before or after your tour, and get an audio guide. The museum includes a lot of information about the history of Hungary and its transition from a monarchy to a Communist government to a republic. My husband doesn't always like museums and he even liked it. If you do want to take the Parliament tour you need to reserve it ahead of time because they do sell out.

The staircase is impressive but the Dome takes some beating as it contains the gold crown which only found it's way back to Hungary from the USA in 1978. The Americans having taken it after the war.There are 132 steps up to main hall but there is also a lift so don't be put off.Our English speaking guide was very good.At 11.30am we saw the soldiers give a marching display outside and you can take pics.We were lucky to take a rivr cruise and pass this building at night when it's lit up.

Located on the Pest side of the Danube, it is little more than 100 years old, but her neo-gothic design feigns 1000 years of history. She is cared for like a rich aging relative, respected and protected. Outside, this building shows off massive peaks, pitches, arches, and a grand dome. At night she is lit up proudly and is breathtaking to behold.Inside the Parliament building is equally magnificent. Ceilings and columns are gilded. Arched doorways are intricately carved. Stained glass, as lovely as you have ever seen, was designed by a Jewish artist who was at the time was free to include abundant symbolism of his faith. Fortunately, during times of war the glass was removed and hidden for protection. The Parliament chambers are not unlike ours in CA, only 50% more beautiful. We were surprised to see real crown of Hungarian on display in the dome room. More than 1000 years old, it has been lost and stolen untold times. Most recently, the U.S. held it at Fort Knox until the end of communist occupation. President Jimmy Carter returned it the Budapest in 1978. In the basement of the building is a small museum that includes the giant red glass star of communism that had been placed on the dome from 1949 to 1989. We gasped to see it, and appreciate it was not displayed proudly, but rather partially obscured from view to diminish its appeal."

You would be hard pushed not to see it once you find the Danube! It is the probably the most photographed attraction in the city, both day and night. Work was started on the construction in 1885 and completed in 1904. You really have to reflect on the fact that over 1000 people were employed in it's construction, using 40 million bricks, half a million precious stones and 88 kilos of gold and all this over a hundred years ago! If travelling to the city and you want to tour the building it is best to research it via Google and book your tickets, in advance online. Trying to buy tickets on the day, at the Parliament can be a bit hit and miss and tours are often sold out."

While the three rooms you get to see are beautiful, the tour is actually only a brief 20 minutes (half the 45 minute tour is getting the group set up and walking to the rooms) and covers a really small portion of the building.

Having arrived early, we spent some time in the expensive souvenir shop. One of the few public places in Budapest to have free toilets!Guide was good but she was running through her preset commentary in a monotonous way. Impressive structure inside. A lot of gold plating. The parliament has 190 seats where each member logs in with a smart card which identified the person. Four buttons each desk- yes, no, abstain and permission to speak. The last one tells the speaker your intention to speak. The vote is instantaneously shown on two large screens. We were left wondering, why such a simple and efficient system is not used in the British Parliament.The building is equally beautiful from outside with a lot of photo opportunities. It must be seen from close, from boat in the river Danube and during the day and night."

The tour was of only a small part of the building but what we saw was very impressive. You can take photos except of the royal crown and septor.

She gave us details about the various Heads of State, history of Budapest and parliament, as well as many details about the building itself, especially the Crown Jewels. We saw opulent rooms that were exquisitely decorated with statues, chandeliers and frescos. Overall it felt very palatial, particularly with all the gold which adorned many rooms.

Traffic was directed elsewhere allowing more space for bicycles and pedestrians. It is a good idea to buy tickets in advance and watch the building from the inside. It is sometimes possible to join another group if you don't book ahead, but there is a chance that it will be a French or Hungarian group where you won't understand the guide. Anyway it is still a great experience to see the Holy Crown of Hungary which is a legal entity itself."

We did not take the tour of the inside the parliament building but rather we strolled around the outside and learned from our Guide of the history of the building.The parliament building is a very impressive building on the Pest side of the city. It is an easy walk from the main shopping street. The building is particularly impressive at night when it is illuminated. A must see from the river if you are on a boat. When at the parliament walk down to the bank of the river and look at the Shoe Memorial. The shoes honor the Jews killed by the fascist Arrow Cross in Budapest during World War 2. A chilling sight and makes one think of a similar shoe display the museum in Auschwitz Concentration Camp.This is a must do in Budapest."

I also did the thermic baths, which are lovely In with bus ticket you also get a hop on hop off river trip, the Danube is a huge river. Yes take good walking shoes you can walk miles. The food was good, we went to the oldest and original Schnitzel restaurant, you can see them making them fresh to order. I would go again, maybe a little later so I could do the Christmas market, they were just setting one or two up as we came home. The indoor food market is interesting, and also on the plus side the weather was fab, brilliant sunshine crisp and cold. Just how I had expected it to be."

Sadly, this is apparently run by the gov't who seem to employ staff devoid of the big picture, not interested in what there is to tell or weaving in the background to better explain the situation and who apparently have more pressing engagements elsewhere.By all means, do the tour, but prepare yourself independently. Don't expect much from the docent who will lead you with steel gloves lest you might go off tour. Be ready to take your pictures when permitted, dawdling to soak in the beauty will get you chased off if after the tour guide has moved on by the officious guards.At the end of the tour, put time into the final history gallery where at least you can get an idea of the history - which hopefully you'll already have gleaned prior to coming to the Parliament.If you're a local, be sure to state so - you'll get a discount.

From the outside, this is quite an architectural masterpiece -- absolutely stunning. We booked tickets through our hotel the night before the day we wanted to go -- by then, pickings were slim for a group of 4. Recommend making reservations as soon as you arrive in Budapest, if not before. The only reservation we could get was for first thing in the morning. In hindsight, I think this was the best --and definitely the least crowded -- time to go ... so if you don't mind getting up early, book your tour for the morning."

Next day we turned up at the allotted time and joined our group and another group of German - speaking. Our tour guide was excellent, and using the special headsets we were all able to hear her. We were able to take photos on all but one room.. The interior is as fabulous as the exterior, and the stories of the history and use of the different rooms make it a very interesting 45 mins. At the end there's a display room with all sorts of extra info about the building, which is also worth spending some time in. All in all, a great place to visit."

We couldn't get an English tour when we were there, so joined a French tour. You can always read about what you see later on...just being able to look is worth the price. You can take photos anywhere but NOT in the dome where the crown is displayed. A lot of steps going up and down so wear good shoes!"

Tours last about 40 minutes and take you to a few rooms, including the rotunda that houses the crown of St. Stephen. Our guide was informative and well prepared. Tours are offered every 15-30 minutes and can be booked online at https://www.jegymester.hu/eng/Production/480000/Parliament-visit. Make sure you book during business hours, otherwise tour times will show as unavailable. E-tickets are not accepted at the gate, so make sure you arrive early and get paper tickets at the information desk of the visitor's center. Enjoy it!"

First, you need to book ahead online to be sure of a place on an English tour.On arrival there is a scrum at the entry / security point. They only allow one or two tour groups through at any time. Others are turned away. But, there are no signs saying who gets through. Guides come to the gate and say once which group should now come through. So, only get there 10 mins before tour at the most and then watch/listen for your guide.Once through, the tour and the building are well worth the hassle. Highly recommended and do visit the memorial to the 1956 uprising too."

You should be sure to visit twice, one in the day and once at night. I understand the building is 1/8 occupied. I didn't take a tour, but wish I had. The building is near two of my favorite restaurants, Duran Szendvics (Sandwiches) and Hummusbar. Both provide simple, fresh, flavorful meals at ridiculously cheap prices. (I've reviewed both restaurants elsewhere.) After lunch or dinner, stop at Aldi for a triple chocolate ice cream bar for about 70 cents. You can enjoy your ice cream bar at the local park in Szabadzag ter. It's fun to grab a seat near the statue of Ronald Reagan and watch other tourist take pictures with his likeness."

The tour is a bit disorganized at first, but it's a good tour thereafter, and you can take pictures most places in the building. If you've been through enough Capitol building tours, there's a sameness to them. But each comes with its own heroes and history and architecture. The tour was worth the time and cost (about US20). Consider booking the tour online if you can print the tickets and bring them with you. The Parliaent has a nice gift shop with better souvenirs than the usual schlocky gift shops around town.. There's also a small cafeteria with decent sandwiches and the like. If it's lunchtime when you are there, it may be the best option as other food may be a medium distance away. The cafeteria staff speaks very good English"

It looks wonderful both close up and from a distance both during the day and at night from either the Chain Bridge or the Buda side of the city. The setting is also wonderful although it is worth considering that in front of parliament was where the massacre that ended the 1956 uprising occurred. When we visited there was a small \u2018museum\u2019 exhibition about the events of 1956 just a short walk from the parliament building and which was a sobering but worthwhile experience. When we visited the parliament building we had intended to go on a tour inside the building but did not want to wait three hours for the next English Language tour. It is possible to book on-line so if the interior of parliament is something you really want to see then it\u2019s probably a good idea to book in advance. The visitor centre where tours depart from has a nice caf\u00e9 and other facilities where it\u2019s nice to escape to be cool on a hot summer\u2019s day."

Tours are run all day in different languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, Russian etc. You should arrive early in order to make sure you are able to purchase a tour ticket before they sell out, as they are very popular so tours sell out quickly! The tour lasts approximately 45 minutes and guides you into beautiful, grand and decadent halls - the grand staircase was definitely the highlight of the tour for me! I would recommend this tour to friends, however it involves quite a bit of standing around and listening to the tour guide provide information on each room so I would not recommend taking children on this tour."

Inside, you will be taken through the various corridors and rooms of the palatial structure, which was built in the 18th century. The tour takes you to this gigantic hall which is exactly under the dome, where the Crown jewels are kept and is well guarded by traditional Hungarian guards. The Parliament grounds are vastly spread throughout the area. I would recommend to go early to avoid the crowds."

Getting to see the Hungarian crown jewels and the parliament chamber are the highlights, with lots of interesting facts learnt throughout.With discounts for EU citizens and the option to book online before and print tickets, it's well worth a visit for anyone interested in history, architecture and politics."

While on a Danube River Cruise, my wife and I were lucky enough to stop in Budapest and see this majestic building. It is the epitome of what you expect buildings to look like in Europe.After our guided tour of the city we were able to explore Budapest on our own and had to visit the Parliament building for our photo op. While I believe they offer guided tours of the Parliament building, we did not partake in any of those tours. Instead we simply walked along the river bank and around the building to see it from all angles. What one would imagine to be the front side of the building along the river bank, is actually the back side of Parliament. If you walk around front you can get another beautiful and different view of this classic government house and catch Hungarian soldiers stationed at attention. The Hungarian Parliament is a must see for you to claim your iconic photo. Yes, some people may not see the reason or purpose to go, as it is just a building. However, don't we all enjoy Europe for its classic architecture? As an added bonus, be sure to visit at night when it is lit up!"

You enter the guest center for the start of the tour. This center also has free toilets just outside, and a very nice gift shop and cafe inside. The tour itself was conducted by a young lady who had excellent English. It is a relatively thorough tour, full of historical facts, that well displays the grandeur of the building.

My main piece of advice is to plan the visit well ahead: there are many tours per day but if you get there late you may be disappointed because English ones are full.Moreover, the entrance is about 10 minutes walk far from the nearest station..Luckily I could join the Italian one (the guide was so kind to translate in the breaks for English speakers!). Brief security checks are performed at the time of the tour and a receiver with headphones is handed out to hear the guide! Very handy!The building itself is quite nice but not exceptional; the crown in the mid of is the most important part (no photos allowed in that room). The tour is rather informative but may be inessential, such a shame that the recent history is relegated to the end of the tour with a brief exhibition. If you are lucky enough you may witness the change of the guard in the room of the crown jewels.To be honest, I would not recommend to families with little children as it will be a bit boring for them. Overall, it's hard to rank it as the most important thing to do in Budapest..Final reminder: Do keep an eye on your ticket as you can't go OUT without it!"

If you can, go up the stairs and take photos.Seeing the crown was my highlight. Who knew it was smuggled out of the country during WWII and given to the Americans, safely held at Fort Knox until the mid 1970's?The tour is under 40 mins, which seemed short for such a large historical building."

Although I didn't go inside this is great place to visit and see the changing of the guards, also explore the surrounding area with water features, statues, bridges, caf\u00e9's etc. There is a market close by just behind the Royal Savings Bank which does great food, pastries and drinks. Make sure you go down underground to the left of the Parliament building (as you face it with the water feature and soldiers behind you). There is a free memorial to the people who died in the square in 1956. You can still see the bullet holes in the wall of the building opposite. Makes you appreciate life and the freedom we all have to explore such beautiful cities."

Our tour guide is very strict (we don't allow stand near the crown) but other tour guide (Spanish language) is more flexible.

Its stretches between Chain Bridge and Margaret Bridge on the Pest bank of the Danube river. It draws one's attention from almost every riverside point. One should definitely visit this place at-least during day time as well as during night when the whole parliament building lights up, and panoramic view is awesome Highly recommneded !!"

The Parliament building itself is gorgeous from the outside, but definitely spring for the guided tour to see just how beautiful it is on the inside. The tickets are expensive, and I'd recommend buying the online in advance. We made the mistake of just showing up, but that didn't work. And no, the ticket office does NOT sell tickets tickets for any future dates--only that day. The online ticket shop is a bear--you have to register, then choose how you want to pay, etc. Set aside about 10 minutes to get through the whole process. Still worth it though."

Construction began in 1885 and the building was inaugurated on the 1000th anniversary of the country in 1896, but not completed until 1904.

You tour the area that is no longer used for political use, there are parallel sides of the building. The interior is stunning. There is a small museum regarding the building of parliament at the end of the tour and we were able to enjoy that as well. You must pay to use the restroom but you can take your receipt to the cafe and use it toward something there. We got some cappuccino and a pastry to relax there."

With this in mind please note that only a few tours are organized for each language for a day, so you might need to wait quite a lot until your lamguage will be available.If you leave in the EU , price is 2200 HUF for an adult. IF not it's 5400 HUF. Discounts for students and children are also available.The tour takes aproximately 1 hour, and will allow you to see the main rooms, halls and locations in the Parliament. Useful imformation will be provided each step.Really enjoyed this tour. It helped me better understand Hungary and it's roots."

For 200HUF (just under \u00a36 for us Brits) we had a guided tour (in English) around the inside of the building. It is absolutely splendid! Ornate decoration - especially the golden ceilings - and an interesting history. Our guide was great and very helpful. There are also lifts available for those who were less able to take the stairs. Really recommend it!"

            "review": "#1 attraction in Budapest. The Hungarian Parliament certainly deserves its reputation as the #1 attraction. It is a gorgeous building both outside and inside and has a rich history. In this review I will concentrate on practical information.Views from the outside: There are excellent views of Parliament in the morning from Kossuth Lajos square and in the afternoon/evening from Batthyany Square looking directly across the Danube and from Castle Hill (at top of Funicular, in front of National Gallery, and near Fishermen\u2019s Bastian). Chain Bridge has nice but somewhat distant views mid-day though evening. Ideally you should see Parliament from several views and both daytime and evening/night when it is beautifully lit. See photos with locations identified.Tours are the only way to see the interior. The tour lasts 45 -60 minutes and is informative. You are allowed to take photos everywhere (including flash) except the Dome Hall (where photos are not permitted even without flash). My favorite places were the Assembly Hall, Grand Staircase, and Dome Hall (see photos for the first 2). Tour tickets: Same day tickets can be purchased at the onsite ticket office on the lower level north end of the building (where the tours depart). There are several English tours throughout the day but the times vary with the day. It is best to arrive early in the morning to get the tour time of your choice (or even to get a tour- by early afternoon the day may have sold out in English, although they do sometimes add late tours). According to the ticket office, advance tickets can also be booked online, and as others have suggested, if you know the day/time you want to go before leaving home this is the best option (I would not recommend sending credit card information over hotel wireless). Parliament is on the M2 metro line (Kossuth Lajos Ter station) and the tram line that runs along the river, so if your hotel is on the metro or tram it is easy to run over to get tickets and then go back later for the tour (there are also buses)."

To the point where we wore head sets if you didn't keep up then it went out of range so had no option to appreciate the decor. High cost for a poor show. glad managed to get at EU price and considered that it wasn't good value at the lower price. Works out \u00a32 a room with full on security check, certainly not my idea of value or fun. Agree security is important however should not be part of the 45mins tour!

If you want to take the 50 minute tour of the interior be forewarned that it is imperative that you buy your tickets online as very few, if any, are sold onsite the day of the tour. Advanced tickets are available online at www.jegymester.hu/parliament. Tour itself was very interesting (although we preferred the tour of the British Parliament) and is offered in several languages. English tours are offered at 1000, 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1500. Tours depart from the Visitors' Center. We were told that someone would announcement the tour approximately 5 minutes before scheduled start time. Unfortunately it is not announced via microphone so it is difficult to hear, especially since several tours are started at once and all funnel through the same entry point. As a result it was a mad house with people trying to figure out where to go and there was some pushing and shoving as they got closer to the turnstile. We viewed a near fight between two mid-aged females who each thought the other was trying to push ahead in line. Since you have to go through a metal detector it also takes a while for everyone in your tour group to be cleared. Once inside the tour takes you through chamber meeting rooms and impressive hallways. You also get to see the Hungarian coronation symbols: St Stephen's Crown, the orb, the scepter, and the Renaissance sword. If the tour start-up was more organized I would have given the tour 5 stars but I feel that the disorganization was enough to reduce my rating by 1 star."

It is worthwhile to do a 45 minutes guided visit to the interiors since explanations are interesting and specific. You will be able to do in multiple languages: English, Spanish, German, Italian, French. You can book your tickets online to skip the queue and book a time. If not you, will get whatever is available when you reach (tickets are sold at the visitor\u2019s center next to the Parlament). In our case we hardly found any queue and got tickets for a visit an hour and a half later."

We really enjoyed the tour and there is an interesting exhibition at the end that looks at the design, constructions and development of the building. A lot of people just walked straight through the area, but if you have the time I recommend reading a few of the stands (or there are short videos you can watch) because it is quite interesting and adds to the experience.As a final tip, the entrance to the visitors centre is on the right hand side (when facing the front) of the building and is down some steps.

This was the first thing we did and it is a good introduction to the history of Hungary and the beauty of Budapest and the Danube River. There are some stairs but it is not a difficult tour. Tours are available in multiple languages. Be sure to visit the museum underneath Parliament. The gift shop has some very nice items. We waited for the next tour in English and visited The Shoes on the Danube Bank nearby, a memorial to the many Jewish people shot by the fascists there in WWII."

Because you pick your time and language when you book, the tour preparation is very smooth. The beauty of this building- brimming with history made me really think about how we do this in America. Do not miss the tour- and the breath taking view at night when it is all lit up."

We had not booked ahead, we bought our tickets for a 1:30 pm tour and used the time before to visit the free museum. The museum information was very well presented and provided us with a good political oversight of Budapest. As for the guided tour, it was well worth waiting for. The parliament is beautifully decorated and the tour guide provided insightful information on the building and the history. Would highly recommend the visit."

We sailed by in the morning and then in the evening our boat did a night cruise to take in the lights of this building and the sites along the Danube -- all of which were absolutely incredible.

After everyone (group of about 30) were allowed to pass through except for about 8 of us, the woman left with no further explanation. 15 minutes later, at our scheduled tour time, she came back and waved us through. At that point, one couple had already left. The second technical issue was that my husband's audio set they gave him did not work, so I gave him mine and ended up not hearing most of what was said on the tour."

Stunning sums it all up and there is really no need to say anything else, however . . . .A truly magnificent building which needs to be viewed from a boat on the river and also from the Castle Hill District as well as by walking all around it. To complete your enjoyment you need to take the tour inside. It is hardly surprising that this is the No1 must-see in Budapest. The regular changing of the guard in the square is an added bonus. I also liked the very trendy sunglasses that all the soldiers around the Parliament building were wearing.When we were in the square steam suddenly shot out from the manholes and obscured the view and most of the people in the square rushed into the steam to enjoy the novelty of the situation - very interesting. If all this was not enough there are a number of stunning statues and monuments together with some equally interesting buildings around the square. Look out for the bullet holes spattered all over the face of one of the buildings. I love the way that the trams go round Parliament square."

The tour, while definitely worthwhile, was short on detail and descriptions of artwork. There is a short visit to an unused legislative chamber (formerly where the House of Lords met). There was not enough room for our entire group to view the room while the guide was talking. If you are short (as I am), be sure to go into the room as soon as possible to get a place at the railing. Also, the visitors entrance for queuing up is at the northern end of the building."

Background: I'm currently living in Romania so I decided to take a weekend in Hungary to visit Budapest. I'm so glad I did, and I can't wait to go back! The food was amazing and there is so much to see and do that I couldn't do it all in one weekend! I had no idea what to expect before going there, and wish I'd don't more homework beforehand researching the city, but I decided to go last minute. If you're planning a trip you must do your research beforehand to decide what you want to see and do while there. Take a Hop-On Hop-Off tour for sure! If you're able to, I suggest walking from the top of the Citadel down to the Danube. Now about Parliament, I didn't get a chance to visit inside to view the Crown Jewels this trip, but I hear it it is well worth seeing the inside of this amazing architectural building!"

We'd say the Parliament is one of the top Budapest sights. Tours include a monitor and headphones so you don't have to keep up with the guide or strain to hear her over your fellow tourists. The building is beautiful. One highlight is the dome room that contains the 1,000 year old crown of Saint Stephen. The crown, guarded by two no-nonsense guards with swords and a third man a Soviet style handler, has a very unique history. The tour takes you inside one of the Parliament chambers. Hungary formerly had a bi-chameral legislature but adapted to a one-chamber parliament after WWII. Some of the artifacts in the museum are also interesting such as the former star that adorned the building in the communist era. So don't miss out. Book your tickets online and enjoy."

While most tourists view the Parliament building during the day, we were lucky to have an evening river cruise with Scenic to see it all lit up at night. Many lights were used which showed off all its main structural features - the towers, the dome, the classic exterior. The building is very long so the lights used provided a spectacular effect, especially with the reflected image on the river - gold on dark waters. On the opposite side of the hill, St. Matthias Church and the Fisherman's Bastion were also lit up. Both, at night, provided a fantastic show of Budapest's tourist sights. Our river cruise ship, the Scenic Jasper, was docked on the Buda side just opposite the Parliament buildings, a notable landmark for Budapest. This location provided different pictures than those taken at the front entrance of the parliament on its square where it was surrounded by many statues of importance to Hungarian history. Similar views of the Parliament would also be seen from the Fisherman's Bastion up on the Buda hill. From across the river, the stone work on the Parliament gleamed in the sunshine. When viewed across the river, it's symmetrical architectural design was apparent with its rows of windows and balanced placement of turrets and a central dome.We didn't take a tour of the inside of the Parliament as it seemed just too complicated to get individual tickets. The time to be spent at the Parliament would thus vary depending upon what you wanted to see."

We went to the ticket center around 9 am and were able to get tickets for 4 pm. The ticket center is not difficult to find but it is set back from the initial Parliament area--you just need to keep walking and you will eventually find it. The tour was worthwhile and provided some interesting tidbits about the building and the operation of the Hungarian Parliament (e.g. has 96 steps which is significant since Budapest was founded in 896). The crown Hungarian Kings wear at their coronation was on display and under guard. We went to the actual room where one of the houses of parliament meet. The building is very ornate and beautiful.We also saw the building lit up at night on a Danube boat trip--a stunning sight!I recommend this sight as a must see in Budapest."

The building and the area around it was well preserved, it was nice and clean everywhere. There were guards there with guns in their belt, but they were friendly and just explained where I should go, when I tried to enter the wrong door. I got the impression that I could have gotten into the library, but I did not take the time, so I never got inside the impressive building. If there is a guided tour, I would like to take that on my next visit to Budapest."

Our first view of the building was from a taxi on the opposite shore of the Danube, at night time - it was amazing! The building would appear to have been either well maintained, or recently cleaned. It was lit up, and had the appearance of an ivory carving. we walked around it the following day, but the best view of the building is actually from a river boat. The building is the largest in Hungary and standing close to it doesn't give the best photographic experience."

Our tour guide was very gently spoken and had s lovely sense of humor. He was easy on the eye also. However, his narrative paid no attention to the rocky past of Hungary with Nazti and subsequent Soviet rule. It was a sweetened version of the history with all the detail removed. It almost felt like the narrative betrays the struggle these beautiful people have endured. If I were Hungarian, I'd be cross. Take the tour and see what you think of the vanilla historical narrative. By the way, the architecture of the museum Centre where the tour begins is very sympathetic and stylish, allowing the grandeur of the parliament buildings to remain the focus.It's over priced for a 45 min tour..

Like other tourists there, we were getting a little anxious if we were in the right place. But you have to remain there until your time and language is called, and even at that, the large booked groups get priority to go through first.

Every time I turned down a street and caught a glimpse of it peeking out above the rooftops, or saw it staring back across the Danube at night it made my heart skip a beat. This is not a building to go and see just once, but to experience from all angles, all across the city, and at all times of day and night.*Budapest has thoughtfully made a bronze miniature of the building and labeled it in Braille so that it's beauty is accessible to even more people. This can be found near the northeast end of the building."

You can learn quite a lot and see some interested aspects of the building, the crown jewels are also here, it only lasts an hour and the whole visit; about an hour and a half."

I'm here to tell you that on the day in May that I was there, by 9:45 am the only tour spots remaining were in Hebrew, Italian or Russian. So if that works for you, fine. If not, reserve your tour time and language online in advance! You cannot tour Parliament on your own; you must go with a tour group. The building itself is truly magnificent, definitely a more beautiful working environment than any of us is likely to encounter. Be sure to take 10-20 minutes at the end of the tour to view the history of the building, how they change the light bulbs in the chandelier in the grand hall, see the Red Star that was removed from the top of Parliament when the Soviets departed, etc."

The guide's English was good, but the group was way too large to see all that was being pointed out. It too a long time to go through security and when it was over, we really did not see that much of the buildingThe best part of the visit to the Parliament building was the outstanding museum exhibit. There were earphones and easily an hour's worth of viewing and listening to the history of government in Hungary.

The tickets can be purchased in advance online, or you can just buy it at the ticket office inside the building. Usually, you will have to wait for two hours at least, in order to join the next group. But it is worth waiting!The guided tour takes you through the most important rooms and coridors, and you will have the chance to see the famous crown of Hungarian emperors. Taking photos is allowed. Only the crown cannot be photographed and it is guarded by a warden. Museum is nice and small and shop has a nice selection of different souvenirs like postcards, shirts, mugs, pencils, books,magnets etc. The only thing I find rather discriminating is the diference in the ticket price for EU and non-EU citizens. Non EU citizens pay higher price and I cannot find any good reason for this politics. It really leaves a bitter taste in your mouth before you even start your tour. The Parliament is amazing at night seen from the boat cruise. Enjoy!"

Booked tickets online to skip the queue and it was very smooth to get in. (you need to print out the ticket tho so ask at your hotel). Adults 5200ft, students of non EU citizen 2600ft. Sometimes they sell out if you go to the Parliament to get the tickets so I really recommend you to book it in advance. Unfortunately it'll cost some extra (e-ticket fee and PayPal fee if you choose to pay via that option) but it was only 1000 ft (like $3-4) so I didn't care. Inside was very beautiful and even tho I felt the ticket was a bit pricy the guided tour made it up for it. 45 mins guided tour was very informative and you can take pictures everywhere except the dome (she'll tell you). Walk from chain bridge or use metro. St istvan basilica is also nearby."

The parliament was so amazing and the boat stops right in front so you can get amazing pics. I have a fish eye lens that I put on my iPhone and the pic was great. Tried to go at night but the last ride is at 8 so if you are there in the fall you might be able to get a night pic but it was summer so we had to come back at 9.

We were glad we did as they had sold out for the day by the time we arrived at 08.45. Glad we are still EU citizens as it gave us a good reduction. We went around as a group,of about 20 with a fluent guide and a security guard. Excellent commentary and easy to hear with provided hearing microphone device. Questions were encouraged and there was no feeling of being rushed. There were lifts for people with mobility problems. Amazing interiors, so much gold and marble. Tour took about an hour and a half in total."

Security pre -tour was very quite rude to other visitors. Tours operate on a timetable, and I saw a security person get handed a ticket from some visitors, she looked at them handed the tickets back and waived the people out of the queue. They stood there , oblivious to what the issue was, and then she shouted at them to get out of the queue and pointed to the time on the tickets (apparently they were booked for another time). Not great to witness paying visitor's being treated in such a way."

Most areas you can take photos but not in the treasure room where King Stevens gold crown is guarded by 2 guards armed with swords at the ready they stand stock still for about 15 minutes then they change sides with a series of very co-ordinated movements. They are changed hourly. The cabinet they are guarding contains a very modest looking gold crown and a sceptre. their value is in their antiquity rather than their basic metal value. From the treasure room we pass into the Parliament chamber which is quite modern rather like the scottish parliament lay out. The building in general is modesdtly lavishly decorated. much like many grand buildings. Going out I took the lift! very sensible. This building is worth a visit but not overly exciting."

            "review": "Overrated and just a lousy experience. When you're the #1 rated attraction in a major city, the bar is set high. And this place fell painfully short for me. For starters, we arrived a couple of hours before the place had closed for the day and were told that there were no English tours left for the day. This was a bit disappointing, but not the end of the world. So we agreed to take the tour in Spanish. We paid the nearly $20 USD (which seemed very high compared to every other attractions in Budapest) and waited. Once the tour began, we asked if we could at least have a guided hearing device that was in English instead of Spanish since we do not speak or understand the language. The answer was \"no.\" During our tour, we crossed paths with 2 other tours that were in English and they were only filled with Japanese tourists. This did not sit well with me because it clearly means that they should add a tour in the Japanese language or not sell out the entire tours in English to an entire group of tourists. Or at a minimum, it means they need to add more tours. They are a humongous building with the #1 Tripadvisor rating for crying outloud! When we got to the Dome part of the tour, the security guard was yelling at people for standing too close to the enclosed crown, but not applying his logic fairly. Everyone was standing at the same distance yet he was yelling at certain people to move back who were at the same distance as everyone else? These people were not doing anything wrong. I also did not understand why we could not take photos in this area but could take photos elsewhere? The tour itself was only 50 minutes and barely covered much of the building. And at the $20 pricetag, it just wasn't worthy of the high rating in my opinion. Spend your money elsewhere. Plenty more beauty to see in Budapest."

We finished the tour at the chambers where the Hungarian parliament sits.

Our guide spoke excellent English and provided lots of historical background. You can only go inside on a guided tour (they sell out often), and you'll truly be oohing and ah-ing the entire time. You ARE allowed pictures in every room except the room with the Crown Jewels. Be aware the entrance is only via the Visitor's Center-and if you only have your ticket in e form (like me), just show up early enough for them to print out your ticket. (You must have a printed ticket to EXIT, so hang on to it.) And don't skip the small museum at the end-it's full of interesting videos on how it was built, how they clean it, ect. I'd allow another 15-20 minutes for that. Also, don't miss the Shoes on the Danube tribute to the Jews shot and thrown in the Danube-slightly past the Parliament Building, on the river, to the South. Seeing this building AND the Opera House really give you an idea of Budapest in its finest times, and that the city is certainly regaining that elegance after a long, utilitarian occupation."

However it was born in an affluent time of Hungary's past, where an invitation was sent for a public tender to architects for a Parliament building. The proposed plans were so great that the fair jury decided to propose and Budapest's leadership accepted the proposal to build the first three plans on the same square. The winner became the building of the actual Parliament, runner up was the magnificent building currently hosting the Ministry of Agriculture and third came the Ethnographic Museum. The three splendid building makes Kossuth Square a place to be impressed"

In the plaza outside, it is an eerie feeling to know that the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was begun with students marching to that plaza. In the building, the tour timing is rather rigid, but the tours are very well done. The reviewer focusing on the beautiful lighting at night is correct. We did not visit at night, but simply seeing it at night lit up along with the beautifully lit surrounding buildings was nothing short of sensory overload. We recommend it wholeheartedly to visitors. Do not attempt to simply walk up and tour. Make arrangements in advance or you might be disappointed. The 12th century Crown of St. Stephen is displayed there."

            "review": "Magnificent Structure. The easiest way to get there is to reach the Danube river bank and get on the #2 tram which stops right in front. This tour takes about 45 minutes and is well worth it. Strongly suggest that you book your tickets on the internet and pay for them well in advance as the English language tours fill up quickly. This way you can pick the day/time that's fits your schedule. We booked our 2 weeks in advance from USA.Plan to arrive about 45 minutes to an hour ahead. This will give you time to walk around the building, take photos and appreciate the architectural beauty of this building. There is a changing of the guards ceremony every hour in front of the entrance (opposite side of the Danube). Towards the side where the statues are located, look for the entrance to the underground museum (small) that shows the history and reconstruction efforts after the war. This is a free museum. The entrance for the main building tours is at the visitors center which is also located on the same side, far end of the building, and underground. The website says you need to have your passport prior to entry, but that is only if you want to get discounts for EU and local citizens. They did not ask for mine as we had paid the highest price on the web as US citizens. ;-(The tour starts with climbing about 140 steps through the golden stairwells which are decorated with gold leaf. Very ornate and beautiful. The most spectacular part of the tour is under the dome which contains the Crown Jewels or the crown of the first king of Hungary. You cannot take photographs in this room, only. There are several other chambers / rooms with ornate statues and painted ceilings which are also worth seeing."

Has 691 offices (but it\u2019s said that only 10% of its area is used), 268 metros and it\u2019s the third biggest Parliament in the world. Along the external walls, you can see the remembrance of monarchs and military Hungarian commanders shown in 90 statues. Inside, elements of Baroque and Renaissance along with 40 kilograms of gold used on its ornaments. Guided tours of 50 minutes are offered in English and several other languages. Make sure to photograph it and to see the change of guards.

The only place where cameras must be turned off is the domed chamber where the royal crown is stored under guard.It's a shame because the domed ceiling is a sight to enjoy, and the guard rotation an added nicety to the visit.This is a must-see landmark if it's your first visit to Budapest, or if you have not had a chance to see it in prior visit. Oh! There is a free rest room just outside the main entrance and that's a bonus in Hungary where a pit stop will usually cost you the equivalent of 50 cents to a dollar. Well, somebody must pay for the lavish decor of the people's house."

It was inaugurated in 1896, to celebrate the first millennium of the Hungarian state, but it wasn't completed until 1904. It is a magnificant Neo-Gothic building, with tall spires, carved stone decorations, multiple statues of Hungarian statesman and patriots and outstanding bas-reliefs. Inside, a majestic staircase leads up to the second floor. Multiple hallways are impressively decorated and furnished.The ceilings are beautifully decorated with frescoes and the stained glass of the windows shows family crests of Hungarian kings and members of the nobility. The Hungarian assembly uses one part of the building and there are guided tours daily. These are quite informative and this should be a mandatory stop for all visitors. Since the return of the Royal Crown in 2000, it is displayed in the central hall. The entire building was recently cleaned and renovated, so it is in top shape and just downright beautiful."

The lightning makes it even more impressive, almost like fairytale. Fun fact: the parlement was designed during a competition who could build the best building for this goal. Three architects made the top 3 and nr. 1 obviously became the parlement. The other 2 are next and across from the parlement, because they felt that they deserved a spot as well. Interesting to see how the parlement is way prettier than the other 2... no competition whatsoever if I had a say in it!"

We found that the 3 English tours were sold out. We decided to visit the next day on the off chance and discovered that there were 2 tours available that were not showing on the website. It is much cheaper for EU citizens (with ID) than non EU citizens. The tour itself lasted an hour including the security check and collection of headsets. To be honest it didn't live up to expectation. The guide was pleasant and knowledgable but her delivery was rather flat. She had a microphone which she kept moving around. This generated a lot of crackling noise in the headset! I expected to see more of the building ( which is very ornate). It's immense popularity might be the reason for the brevity of the tours. The changing of the guard and the view of the building from the opposite side of the river were more impressive than the tour."

One is for the parliamentary use and the other for visitors. It is quite ornate inside, a bit like the Opera House but it was only built in 1905. There are 365 spires on the building and the Dome is for a leap year. We saw the Crown Jewels which are guarded constantly by two soldiers with swords. It was an interesting visit but very hot."

Luckily, this isn't difficult, as it's difficult to miss from either the Buda side or from the river itself. If you have the time and the inclination, the tour (the only way for the public to see the inside of the building) is quite good, although more expensive than pretty much anything else we did in Budapest. You'll have to decide for yourself if the tour is worth it, but you do see some pretty amazing architecture and design, including the crown jewels and what's billed as the largest carpet in Europe."

The Hungarians need to consider their seat of democracy a SYMBOL of that democracy, which I didn't think they did very well on this tour."

Don't be late.The staff will call you when it's your turn to receive the guided tour.You will need to bring your printed ticket for scanning.once you complete the ticket scanning, you will go through a security check just like the airport.Then, you are asked to get a headset/receiver so you can listen to the commentary by the guide. Follow the guide closely. You can take pictures without flash. But they have staff watching you, so when in doubt, always ask if you can take pictures.When you get to the area where the crown jewel is displayed, the guide will ask you NOT to take photos. The tour itself lasts about 30 minutes, but the preparation takes about 20-30 minutes. That's why you need to budget about an hour to 90 minutes for this tour. The tour ends in the souvenir shop. "

Beautiful architecture inside, worth the visit, lots of gold everywhere. You can take picture of the stairwell, hallways, and main chambers but you can't take pictures of the room where the Crown Jewels are housed and there are guards watching. My reason for 4 instead of 5 rating is a found the tour short and we didn't see as much as I thought we would. Took us 15 minutes to get through security and get head sets so give yourself an hour although the tour is 30 mins. Many languages available for the tour besides Hungarian and English such as Spanish, Italian, Russian."

They do not have a system for telling people where to go, when they will be next, etc. It creates a lot of pushing and concern, as you think you may have missed your tour.

Reading the rest of the reviews, I'd have to say I'm very confused at how the tour I went on differed so much from everyone else's.I arrived for a 12:00 pm English tour roughly 15 minutes before tour time. There was a line formed at the turnstile with people quietly conversing in English while a group of school children got sent through the turnstile and the security measures. Once the children were sent through a few of us moved toward the lady checking tickets at which point she literally yelled at several people \"5 MINUTES!\" as if we were children who had been fooling around instead of going in with our classmates and needed a scolding.It wasn't until a few minutes after 12 that she returned and started checking and scanning tickets. By the time we were through security, had headsets and had convened the whole group it was close to 12:15. Our tour guide showed up briefly before disappearing for a few minutes and by the time we had climbed the \"golden stairs\" it was almost 12:25.From there, we had 3 stops and the tour lasted a total of about 20 minutes. One of the major stops was of the crown jewels display where no pictures were allowed. Another was of the House Chamber where the viewing landing was so small that half of the group had to sit outside listening to the explanations of things that couldn't be seen. Then the guide ushered off telling those who hadn't been able to see to take their time looking around but then not even 30 seconds later a guard came to tell us to go keep up with the group. We missed an entire display somewhere because we had been out of range of the audio and the guard kept rushing us to catch up with the group.For the money, I don't honestly understand how this tour can be justified. I paid for a walking tour and instead got a light-speed running tour with not much opportunity for picture taking. Definitely feel ripped off. But hopefully your tour will be as lovely as the rest seem to have been."

The design is symmetrical as, when it was built, there were two houses and each had its own chamber and facilities on each side of the building. Now there is only one house and a much smaller number of representatives. The inside is very ornate and the central dome contains the Hungarian Crown Jewels. Well worth a visit."

As any main building, the interior & the architecture is royal & state of the art and when you stand under the main dome, you'll be amazed. Tip - You might sprain your neck while looking up at it for too long... its really you-might-sprain-your-neck good..."

At the start of the tour, you have to climb about 300 steps, but you can ask for an elevator to get you to the top of the building, which I did and greeted the others on the tour gasping for breath as the arrived at the top of the stairs. Our guide was interesting and informative and the tour was well worth the visit. The building is exquisite and incredibly beautiful."

By all means, see it from the outside.The tour of the inside is perhaps a bit overpriced, but more importantly too impersonal and rushed. The groups are quite large -- at least the English ones -- and the guides speak through a microphone broadcast to a remote headset you wear. The guides provide basic background information, but the tour isn't particular set up for questions, illustrations, or detail To give one small example: There was is a beautiful corridor, and the guide points out the magnificent ceramic statues up-high that were specially crafted for the building. Each represents a different guild from the late nineteenth century (there are maybe 30 or so). But no examples of what the guilds are, and before there is time to even take a look, the tour moves on to the next room. There were plenty of other interesting features of the building. Unfortunately, the tour does too little to help you explore them. (Honestly, the A/V \"museum\" room at the end of the tour -- which you can see without the tour, was much more interesting and informative than the tour itself.

Taxi fare costs about 7000 Hungarian Forints from the airport to Buda side of Elisabeth bridge. We paid over 14000 Forints (got conned by a driver who scorned at Gypsies)2. Currency exchange best done in Budapest - google for TripAdvisor advice (\"hungarian currency\")."

There are nice, clean free toilet at the Visitor Centre. Although yourself a few minutes to get your bearings and be prepared for the airport style security.The tour got underway pretty much on time and the lady dong our tour got the formalities out of the way. Our guide explained that there would be plenty of time for photographs at each stage and also gave very good information throughout. The only place that you cannot take photos is in the room under the dome which houses the crown.The building itself is very grand and beautiful inside and certainly worth a visit. The tour lasts 45 minutes and finishes in an excellent information centre. We stayed a further 30 minutes viewing the history and development of the site. Many attendees brushed over this room. I would strongly recommend spending some time here."

We went on a Saturday and happened upon the guards \"performance\" which is slightly like the changing of the guard but the guards didn't change! This was 12:30 so might be daily. Took the parliament tour which was great! Wished it was a bit longer so we could see more of the interior but understand why it was limited. Only thing that was a little annoying was the entrance through security. It was quite messy and not as efficient as I hoped. But still great tour with a good english speaking guide. Definitely recommend pre booking your tickets online, cheaper for EU citizens by about 50%"

The tour starts at 10am and another later (around 11am if I recall correctly), costs 2000Ft (about \u00a36) for EU (slightly more for other countries) and takes about 40 minutes. Commentary, via headphones, is in German for one group and English in the other.The building, impressive from the outside is even more so inside and covered in many places with gold leaf and stained glass windows. Our guide explained all the features at every juncture, statues of previous kings in the large dome etc and provided an excellent review of Hungarian history. Strangely enough, the Hungarians show scant to no interest in their history before, during and shortly after the Roman period and also during the Communist era. Their history starts at 896AD with the establishment of the conquest of the Magyars. There are many photo opportunities - The 2 chambers, similar to British House of Commons and Lords and other halls but not for the crown with the bent cross.If you like history and splendid architecture, this tour is definitely worth the money"

Go early or sign up online as there are so many people who are aware of this parliament. We had an historian tour guide who led us in English throughout with great insights. There are tour guides in various languages such as Russian and Italian. English tours were running each hour in the afternoon. We were so thankful we got a 4:30 PM tour! The parliament is absolutely magnificent!"

This tour is very informative and interesting provided lots of facts about Hungary's political history.

First of all, the visits announced in the various languages on the Hungarian Ticket Master website do not match the times of the visit once inside. We got there hoping to get tickets for the next sessions but got told everything was sold out for the day and we could not buy tickets for the next day on the spot. I had to buy them online, thank God I have a Hungarian debit card, the fees must be horrible. The next day, we came back for our visit at 3 o'clock. We did not know we were allowed to pass security only FROM 3, taking time away from the actual visit. No proper queue, a rush of tourists trying to get to the front of the line, a rude person scanning the ticket not saying hello nor smiling... We entered and tried to check our coats. The girl literally ignored us for ten minutes. I had to address her in Hungarian to finally have her answer. No coats, only suitcases. OK, but then, display it somewhere.Then we started the visit, the 3 of us with 47 other person (the group size is 50 people, it's huge). The guide's English was very poor, she had a strong accent and no sense of the language. Her speech was very flat, it was very difficult to understand her (and as a ESL teacher, I know about English) and she would not repeat anything, not even the questions she got asked. People are rushing to take photographs and bump into you with no shame to get the best shots. The guide presents a very politically correct version of the Hungarian politics, too blend to be true. I did not learn anything, as I could not understand her or even sometimes hear her from the headphones. This visit was a pricey waste of time."

Tours meet in the underground visitor center at the farthest end of the building. Everyone is given a hearing device so that the guide can speak in a normal voice and everyone in the large groups can hear. A guard accompanies the group to make sure no one lingers and to lock doors after the group is out of a room. The building is where the government functions so expect to see police and soldiers and to be expected to stay with your group. Lingering on your own to take photos isn't allowed but there is time to take photos along the way. I would have liked more time in some places but I understood why we had to maintain the required schedule. The tour was informative. The building is impressive both inside and outside.

            "review": "Parliament OverpisitorsDo not take my picture!\". I had read many positive reports concerning the tour of the interior of the Parliament.It certainly is beautiful, inside and outside. But I fear the tour is vastly overrated. Popularity has made it a tough ticket. Many people need to buy timed tickets in advance for a tour in their language. Non EU citizens are being forced to pay a premium yo take the tour. My ticket was 5200 HUF, in the neighborhood of $20. This for a tour that lasts roughly 20 minutes. Some additional time is required for security and climbing 100 plus steps.There are only four rooms to see. The crown jewels are flocked by two armed guards. We tourists are warned to be sure and not to come within two meters of a guard, or things could get bad. Comfy yet?The information from my English speaking guide was boring, when it was even understood. It was clear she was bored as could be with it and was half dozing. The only time she showed any spirit was when she though someone may have snapped her picture. \"Do not take my picture!\" And there was a big surprise at the end of the tour. Not announced in advance, we were required to have our original tickets available to leave the building. Many of us searched pockets and handbags for the missing ticket.Nice to see, but not worth $20. The bored tour did not help a bit.There are so many free tours in Budapest that are wonderful. Better bang for your buck."

I love this about people of Hungary. We went with a pram and the staff provided us access to lifts. Where there were stairs, guards if visible came to assist my wife.The parliament itself is worth a visit as its hallways and ceilings and halls are grand in every aspect. One of the staircases has 40kg of gold embellishing it- you get the picture. Recommended."

A great time to see the Parliment is at night time from across the river, the lights will switch on every night of the year. Looking at the Parliment on the outside is amazing, all around Budapest you should see spectacular sculptures on the majority of buildings, but the Parliment is excellent! The tour has taken away a star. The tour costs no more than 10euros per person therefore it's probably worth doing. You will find the tour interesting but rather basic. You are guided by one or two people who will take you to a few rooms and provide knowledge and history. Considering the size of the Parliment, you don't see much! The tour lasts around 20minutes and you will see the hall, lobby and chamber during the tour, it's very good but there is more to be seen.To enter the Parliment, behind the building there is a glass dome which takes you underneath. You can visit the shoes on the Danube also, why you're in the district."

The ticket will also give you guided tour of Parliament and explain about the Kingdom of Hungary, the design and technicalities of the Parliament and why the building had an architecture modern for its era.Must see. Better to book tickets in advance. Only a number of people are allowed in a tour and in a day so in a peak season you might not get a ticket or have lots of waiting. Also they don't let you inside until the time of your ticket, not even for security check. The guided tours are in various languages. Metro is Kossuth Lajos Ter, cross the main road walk and walk to go other side where visitor center is. Dont go towards river.

That said, the architecture both inside and out was stunning and the history that we were told about during the trip was wonderful, the crown with the standing guards was stand out. Well worth a visit but like I say, make sure you plan in advance."

My three ways to see this magnificent architecture: 1) Take a boat tour in the evening to see the lit up building, that was a WOW for us. 2) Visit Fisherman's Bastion, from there is the best spot to capture the whole facade of the Parliament in your camera and your sight. That was another WOW for us too. 3) Go to the Parliament inside and outside. We didn\u2019t have the tour because the queue was too long, we just walked around outside and took some close up photos of parts of the building. Happy Travelling!"

However, given the history of Hungary there seems to be a lot more to the building that the tour doesn't go into. The tour was reasonably short (c. 30 min) so there's definitely room to add more. It's more just a quick tour of the building than going into detail about anything. Could easily be 5/5 if there was more added. Check the tour times in your language and book before going. You're not able to go without a tour group and there seems to be 1-2 hours between each language tour."

The guided tour includes a Wi-Fi headset which is presented to you after passing the airport like security. Fascinating Hungarian history presented by a professional guide with a mix of comedy comments thrown in which enhanced the tour. Only bummer being no photography in the main dome where the crown jewels are shown, fine for the rest but not the dome. I'm sure the guards are there for aesthetic purposes but they would gladly chop your head off if required. One of our party almost lost her head after she ventured too close. The guide advised a two metre gap to the soldiers which she ignored. As I said GO!!! and experience this delight, you won't be disappointed."

I recommend going just before it gets dark outside seeing the building both with the lights off and on is truly spectacular. There is also a memorial to the Hungarian revolution and the October 25th massacre that is free to the public and has interesting information on the event."

The tour lasts around 45 minutes of which 15 minutes are spent waiting for all tour participants to pass the security check. We were given audio guides to better understand the guide, but the system was not working very well so that we often only understood fractions of what she was saying. Still, the views inside the building are stunning. So, if you are a EU citizen, have an extra hour of time and primarily want to see the inside, you should just do the tour."

It is based on our own houses of Parliament, which I suppose is some kind of compliment. However you cannot gain entry during the summer and there is little in the immediate surroundings to attract visitors. I do however recommend the boat trip up the river to an island which offers you a range of views of the city. Yu board from a spot just downriver from the parliament building"

It takes a tour or special invitation to visit the interior, but tours are easy to find and plentiful and can usually be arranged through your hotel or one of the tourist venues in the city, or you can pick up tickets at the booth at the main gate. The building is an amazing amalgam of neo-Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture and these details carry into the interior. Soaring ceilings, marble staircases, statuary and amazing artwork are everywhere inside. The tours conclude at the crown jewels, and although some of these are copies (the originals are in a vault) they are worth seeing and the history behind them is very interesting. We highly recommend taking an hour for the visit."

If you're only interested in looking at the outside then make sure you go back on an evening once it's dark, as the way the building is lit at night makes it even more imposing than it is during the day.By pure chance we happened to be outside as the guard was changed and whilst there is an element of aggressive Morris dancing to it, the offer made by the Captain at the end to go and have your photo taken with the soldiers made the British version with no interaction seem rather old fashioned.Tours around the interior are available throughout the day in a number of languages and can easily be booked online or at the visitors centre. Despite Bop's best attempts at persuasion, Beep put his foot down and insisted we went on a tour in our own language, rather than trying to understand what was going on in one we don't speak.Our tour was completed by a very knowledgeable guide and the use of headphones to transmit the guides comments made it easy to hear all the information without having to push to the front of a large group. The magnificent climb up the golden staircase is well worth the effort even if your feet are aching from climbing Gelert hill the day before and the modern technology within the debating chamber again made the British Parliament look antiquated."

The entrance is downstairs in the right end of the building when you're facing the main door in the middle from the court side.The tour will start on time after the security control -no toilets on that side!- and will take about 30 min. The building is amazing! The largeness of it all is breathtaking in a way that no other equal building has so far done. And yet, all the gold and high ceilings would be too much for a longer time. So this would be managable even with some kids or at least teenagers."

You are told to stand well away from them and when they 'perform' their sword swirling to surprise you it is a sight to remember . NB You need ID to get in such as a passport or national insurance card . There are limited numbers to each tour so whilst we were able to walk in out of season I guess that would not be possible when busy . Magnificent building with a good bit of patriotic one upmanship in that it is bigger in size than any other parliament building in the world"

With cafe, shop, and toilets.Arrive about 15 mins before your allocated time. Not to early as tours seem to go through in 15 minute slots. Also more than likely be another language tour going in at the same time as you. There is a clockroom for coats not bags once through airline type security.It is a guided tour takin around a hour. The party can be upto 50 but you get audio guides which means you will always hear your guide.There are large flights of stairs but if required the guide will direct you to the lift.On finishing the tour you will go through a small museum. Which has artifacts showing history of the building."

My recommendation is to buy tickets online, because tickets are being sold out quickly in the tickets office at the location. In case you buy tickets online - remember that the price is lower for EU citizens. In my case I have bought ticket for EU citizen online, however I am not an EU citizen, just living in EU with Ukrainian passport. I was lucky and they didn't check my passport, so maybe it is worth trying the same trick :) The only check they are doing at the entrance - is the security check. The tour itself was not too long, so you don't get tired or bored of it (approx. 30 minutes). The tour guide speaks in the microphone and everyone gets a personal earphone - this allows you to hear every word of a tour guide even if you are stuck behind the group while taking photos."

We got on the cell phone and booked tickets for the following day while we were in the visitor center. They are able to print out the tickets for you about 15 minutes before your tour start time, so don't worry about not having a printer. For the tour itself, it felt like we were rushed through the few rooms we were able to see (main stairway, rotunda with the old Hungarian crown, hall, and the lesser used Parliament room). There was some interesting information, and I enjoyed seeing the old Hungarian crown, but I'm unsure if it was really worth the time and effort of booking and paying for the tickets. Our children (8&5) were bored, and I might have enjoyed it better without them. For a family tour, the Opera is a better choice."

We came here by car but it is accessible by metro. Inside it was very crowded at the X-rays scanner that we had to wait for about 10 minutes. There is a discount for student even you did not bring the student card. Inside, it look similar to other palace in central Europe tough but the guide tour is great. Therefore, It actually look more stunning from outside."

It is a stunningly beautiful neo-gothic eclectic building and it was built from 1885 - 1904, designed by Hungarian architect Imre Steindl. It is a whopping 96 meters tall and it spreads over 17,745m2, making it Europe's 2nd and the world's 3rd biggest Parliament building. The crown of St Stephen (Hungary's first king) can be found in the building too. Photo tip: I have taken some great pictures of the Parliament from Buda Castle - it really is such a majestic, beautiful building, a must-see attraction for all architecture lovers.

We arrived at around midday and booked onto one of the two English speaking tours available that day. While we waited for our tour to begin we paid to visit the parliament museum in the same building. The museum gave us a great introduction to the parliament tour and as we didn't know much about the political history of the country, really added to our experience. Surprisingly we were the only visitors to the museum despite the parliament building itself being really busy with tourists, we couldn't understand why everyone else skipped it as we learnt so much from our short visit! The museum had free audio guides in English too. Our English speaking guide on the parliament tour wasn't exactly a bundle of joy but she got the point across. Inside parliament is amazing, the decor and architecture is stunning. I was surprised at how the idea was based on learning about the English parliamentary system as they seem to have done much better in many ways!"

The position and design of the building was heavily influenced by the Palace of Westminster in London, and similarly the interior contains many fine stone carvings and guilded columns characteristic of the old Austro-Hungarian empire.A visit to this impressive building just has to be high on the list of the sightseer.

Since the grounds have been redone the garden and water feature on the grounds are a wonderful way of spending time before entering the magnificent building and viewing the glorious architecture and beautifully decorated walls and rooms. The visit is not complete without viewing the Great Room where the original Crown of St Steven's sits. Here the Crown can be viewed encased in a special cabinet being guarded by a selected, hand picked Guardsmen. The longer the guided tour one is willing to take the more one's eyes are opened to the magnificent rooms and paintings. The main chambers where the Politicians are seated and debate or discuss the future of the Hungarian country is also a must see."

Realistically not a big deal but it was annoying having a disconnect between groups of the staff.Once past security (same as for an airport), there's an included (won't call it free as we paid for the tour) cloak room and we went on a lovely guided tour of some of the building.They gave us earpieces so we could all hear the guide and the tour mostly consisted of corridors (with gorgeous stained glass windows) and a couple of halls. The most beautiful room was of course the area where photos are not allowed and two security guards with swords guarded the king's crown (complete with crooked cross).Altogether happy to have visited and blown away with the generous decoration that while overpowering in areas, worked well."

Many of them still hold on to the glamour from when the Hapsburgs ruled, even if you can't always tell from the outside. It's incredible how many of these buildings were even able to hold on to most of their beauty through World War II and the communist regime.One of the most beautiful inside and out is the Hungarian Parliament building, which you can tour at several times throughout the day. If you are looking for a tour in a specific language, I highly recommend booking your tour ahead of time so you can make sure you can get a place on a certain language tour when you want it.The biggest downside of the Parliament tour is that it's a little unorganized when you are checking in and going through security. There are tours in many languages going on either at the same time or around the same times, so it can get very confusing as to who should be going through security and what time you should be going through, especially if they get behind.Other than that, the tour is fantastic. The history of the Hungarian people is truly fascinating, and the building is stunning to look at. There are gold pieces everywhere, and the Parliament is filled with paintings, statues and gorgeous colors. The gem of the tour is the Holy Crown of Hungary, which sits in the middle of the building. The crown has a crazy history, and it's heavily debated whether the Americans stole it or were just keeping it safe from communism at the end of World War II. Either way, it's a crown that has seen a lot in its days, and it's awe inspiring to see it in person.The tour lasts about an hour, and there's a great gift shop in the Parliament building, too. This is a highlight of anyone's trip to Budapest, and is a must-do. Add this to your list."

One can view this from Castle Hill in Buda, a good vantage point is the Fisherman's Bastion neat St. Matthias Cathedral next to the Hilton.The exterior architecture is stunning, but the interior has a lavish beauty that gives the impression that no expense was spared in this important national place and symbol of Hungarian statehood. The interior is decorated with significant historical motifs- paintings, statues, stained glass, depicting important figures or events which were seminal in Humgarian national history. One of the highlights is the viewing of the Hungarian crown and regalia- sceptre, orb, sword and cloak. The crown of St Stephen, first king of Hungary was a gift from the Pope.

Some speak Spanish, some Portuguese.At the beginning of the tour, the guide barely presented herself (Fabiana - I had to ask). When we should get the elevator, she saw a line of another group and then decided to climb all the stairs. She didn't even noticed that my parents are over 70 years old and one couldn't climb stairs easily. A guide that doesn't have a perception of its group could never show the building with its desired emotion.After we reach the floor where we should start the tour, she started to walk so fast we couldn't even appreciate the beautiful halls and corridors of the building.When some couldn't understand what she was saying, she didn't even showed effort to explain.It was like she was telling a memorized text. The building is amazing, but the guide completely screwed the visit.Hope the museum administration gets better concern of theirs guides.Pros- beautiful buildingCons- pricey compared to other similar tours in Europe (I.e.

There is a tour of the interior and it is highly recommended. Be advised though as a tourist hotspot, and given that many tours are in different languages, you may have to wait an hour or two. With this in mind I would recommend booking your tickets early on or in advance. The tour takes you through the interior of the building and shows you the main entrance, crown jewels and more.

The tour requires a lot of walking, and you really only stop in five locations around the building. Pictures are allowed along most of tour, except in the rotunda where the crown jewels are on display. The guide was competent, but quiet, and was hard to hear, even with her speaker, unless you were in the first couple of rows of visitors. The undersold part was at the end in the Museum. The guide described it as a \"small display\" of the history of the building, almost as if the museum was an afterthought of the tour. To me, the museum was more informative and interesting that the info on the tour. And after the museum it all ends in classic \"exit thru the gift shop fashion.\" Instead of having tour groups wait in the lobby area before passing security then starting the tour, they should reconfigure the tour so you can pass security and explore the museum before you begin the tour."

The security check was similar to that for international flights. We had an English speaking guide. Photography is allowed all through except in the room where the Royal Crown is displayed. The inner decor of the entire building is very impressive. The walls, the stained glass windows, the statues depicting common people, the carpet that was woven in nine months, the horse-shoe shaped main hall and the excellent maintenance of everything displayed were truly stunning. There's a cigar stand in the corridor just outside the horse-shoe shaped hall. Our guide explained, it was for the members of the parliament to keep the cigars before entering the hall to attend the session. In case a cigar burnt till the end before its owner could come back for a puff, the speech he had been attending was described as \"worth the Havana\" ! Much of the Parliament building was reduced to rubble by the WW II bombings. There's a permanent gallery before the exit which shows how the new building has been reconstructed from old photographs and damaged pieces. Even a cursory visit to this area is a must : it's all about human determination to start afresh with pride and confidence. It's only a few years that entry to this place has become priced. To enjoy a sip and bite at the Parliament Cafe is an added attraction. If one has time to spare one shouldn't miss the \"change of guard\" ceremony just outside the Parliament at about 6 pm ( bright sunlight ), as far as I can remember. After the visit to the Parliament one can walk down to the bank of the Danube in ten minutes."

It really is one of the most stunning buildings in the world. Lovely during the day, but even more stunning in the evening, you will inevitably see this when you visit the city. You can do a tour of the building, in my case I took the tour in English and it was great to see inside the building too. Some amazing parts on the inside too. Plenty of opportunities for photos too - if you buy the photo ticket for a little bit more cash. The tour lasts an hour or so and its a pleasant way to spend an hour in the city and completes the Parliament 'experience'."

The guided tour (that is the only way to visit) was very informative but not too long that it became boring. It was given in a fluent French, and other languages are also available (the day we went Spanish was also on offer). It left me with a thirst to discover even more about Hungarian history."

The building from outside is magnificent on its own, but when you get inside, you will see, it is more magnificent than you have expected. It is worth to book your visit in advance as then you have almost nothing to do and be sure there are crowds waiting to get inside, so every moment you don\u2019t spent in a queue is good one. It took a lot of time, but it is pretty fast and the guide explains a lot of details and historical events related to the building. Coronation jewels are also nice with interesting history as well. Simply go for guided tour, it is worth of it, because you can read about it, you can see pictures, but once you are inside, you can imagine how big and nice this place is. And the Hungarian accent is lovely as well, so the tour has another dimension as well ;-)"

This gave time for a bite of lunch but it may be an idea to buy tickets on-line. If you are an EU citizen you can obtain a significant discount on the ticket price (bring your passport). The building is an interesting pastiche of architectural styles built not much over 100 yrs ago. No expense was spared on its rich interior which is vast. Watch out for details such as the many brass cigar holders in the corridors - apparently all members of parliament smoked large cigars in the early days of the parliament building's life. The crown of King Stephen - a sacred national treasure - is housed here. If you are visiting please heed the rules about no photos of this national emblem and treating it with due respect. On our tour one American girl unfortunately insisted on blithely ignoring these requirements and got a sound telling off from the tour guide and soldiers who insisted on her deleting the photos. Frankly she thoroughly deserved her robust treatment but it did mar the tour slightly.There's a changing of the guard ceremony that can be viewed outside the Parliament building (for free)."

They are very well organised - make sure you arrive about 10 mins before yours. When you are allowed through the security there is a cloackroom where you can leave all your outdoor wear - great for us as we were so well wrapped up - felt like Nanook of the North! and then you are excorted around the public areas.Our guide spoke excellent English and knew his stuff. Could answer all our questions - probably about 25/30 people- and spoke loud enough so we could all hear him. It is an extremely impressive building both inside and out and we loved hearing the history of it and some of the items there - a crown which was bent and its story. Security is good which you would expect for a building with a parliament in everyday use but not overpowering. Don't miss going!"

The size, beauty and grandeur of the Parliament Building overwhelmed us when it first came into view. The Hungarian Parliament Building, completed in 1904, is the quintessential image of Budapest that made me fall in love with the city. I blame Viking River Cruises for my obsession with visiting Budapest. Every time I saw one of their commercials of their river boat cruises down the Danube River across the Chain Bridge opening up to the impressive and exquisite Parliament Building, I knew we would explore Budapest one day because I had to see it for myself. I never thought it would be as soon as it was.The Parliament building was everything I dreamed it would be. The building was constructed in Gothic Revival style. We crossed both bridges on either side of the Parliament Building and walked the length of the river between the bridges to gain an appreciate of the extraordinary building from all angles. We did this walk both in the daytime and in the evening because the views in both lighting are majestic. It just took my breath away.Budapest, while stunning during the day, was breathtaking once the sky turned pitch black. All of the buildings glowed in the darkness, especially the Parliament Building. It looked majestic as it glowed above the Danube River. All of the buildings along the river appeared enchanting."

When the Pest side of Budapest was repeatedly flooded by the Danube in the 19th century the Hapsburgs decided to reinvent the city in the style of Paris and Vienna, with the Parliament building modelled on Westminster in London. Joseph Palatinate rebuilt most of the city in a short time, which is why much of the architecture and decoration of important buildings look much the same. The Parliament reception has rude staff, queues for everything and if you have seen the cathedral, opera house and Alexandra cafe you will have a sense of deja vu as you eventually spend 30 minutes being shown corridors and a big staircase (modelled on Westminster).Don't waste your time and money on this visit; there are far more interesting things to see in Budapest (especially if you are a non EU citizen, where you are charged lots to be kept waiting and abused)."

The head of the patrol was great with the crowd and allowed people to take photos at the end of their 'routine'. Beautiful and amazing structure of a building. It has beaten all other Government buildings I have seen; mind I am planning to visit Washington soon so who knows if it will still be number 1!"

Also, another large group was next to us in some of the areas talking in another langauge and it became even harder to hear.

Even the kids had liked that one.Also, the entry procedure seems a little disorganized -- they only let you in to the security area about 5 minutes before your scheduled tour time and then you have to file through the metal detector/cloak room, which takes a really longggg time. They could have you do that ahead of time, or have you gradually go through instead of having a mob scene.The gift shop at the end (because you exit through the gift shop, of course!) has some really nice items in it, things we didn't see elsewhere."

Its magnificent exterior is matched on the inside by a series of symbolic carvings, frescos, carpets, etc. that you could spend hours looking at. Unfortunately, the tour is rather hurried so you won't get much time except to snap a couple photos and jostle with 40-50 other tourists.The tours for non-EU adults are 5600 FT (about $20 - pretty expensive for Hungary) as well as a processing surcharge. You must make a reservation in advance and print the ticket. When you arrive you must go through security. I had to be patted down. Then you must check your coat. The tours are technically 45 minutes long but this time includes security and coat check, which, for 40-50 people, took around 15 minutes for us. So the tour was only around 2/3 of the time that we thought.That said, the interior is so lovely, you may forget about the bureaucratic machinations you've had to jump through to get there. You will see the grand staircase, a nice lobby, the crown of St. Stephen, and one of the legislative chambers. At the end there's a nice exhibit on the construction of the building, a detailed model, and the inevitable gift shop. You can take photos anywhere except around the crown, which is guarded by 2-3 soldiers. The tour guide was fine but hard to hear at times, since many rooms echo.In sum, I would recommend doing this but keep in mind that you may have to jump through a couple small hoops. You will be climbing stairs, go through security, and you will be hurried along. But you will see a true architectural gem."

The Parliament buildings were modelled on the Westminster Parliament, but the House of Lords equivalent was abolished in 1944, only the House of Commons is in use, so you tour the House of Lords side only. The central dome houses the ancient crown, orb and sceptre, and this is the only area where you are not allowed to take photos. The opulence is amazing, even gold leaf on the skirting boards!BTW avoid the cafe, over priced and truly inedible food the worst we ate in our entire stay in Budapest."

She was very knowledgable, spoke English very well and answered any questions you had,The tour is only about 30 mins-45 mins long, which is perfect really. You get told about the building, about Hungarian royalty and about the government. You seen the Hungarian royal crown, the main entrance hall and the house of lords. At the end of the tour there is also a bit of a museum/exhibition about the building. The architecture inside is stunning!It's very easy to get to, you can see it from all over the city and it's on the bank of the Danube.

I suggest play it on the safe side and take the guided tour. If you do best to book in advance. You can do this on line. While there are several tours daily and in a variety of languages they often sell out well before you get to the ticket office or, in our case get suddenly rescheduled. Staff are not overly helpful and as another review observed it does get chaotic. Tours are short but well worth it. High season crowds would be a definite deterrent. The House sits right on the banks of the Danube and is easily accessible by ether bus or tram. The Number Two tram running along the Danube stops right outside the Visitors Centre. I won\u2019t even attempt to describe the truly extravagant d\u00e9cor, cavernous halls and long high corridors because it would be impossible to do any of it justice.

It isn't so easy to find the entrance of this wonderful building, An this is something that should have improved, Anyhow when you'll find it everything goes very smoothly. You'll find some very good leaders that drive you through all the huge and beautiful rooms and the grand staircase telling you all sort of stories, like the one that there is a place where the ancient parliamentarians had their own place to put the cigar they were smocking, when they had to come into the collective room for voting.. The Parliament has not, as a difference with ours, a kind of huge pit where the Parliamentarians sit in a declining fashion. It is smaller and the people suit normally, next to each other. The building was built so imposingly as an underlining of the independence rejoined within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His style is mainly neo-gothic, but also other styles, like neo-baroque. Anyhow the neo-gothic was a very much fashionable style, at the time when it was built, the end of the XIXth century .The building started in 1887 and ended i 1904 and it lays on the Danube's banks of Pest..At night is all lighted."

Admittedly this is a beautiful building that you absolutely have to see close-up (as well as from across the river up at the castle). Or from a boat cruise. However, as soon as we walked into the \"visitor center\" for the tours, we walked into a disorganized hoard of people and rude employees. Their website says one thing about tours, but the inside says another. To actually see the inside of Parliament, you have to buy a ticket for a tour in your language (about 52000 HUF for non-EU and 2000 for EU) \u2014 but when we showed up at 12pm, it seemed that the only available time for English was at 3:45 (I don't know why their website says 10, 12, and 2). People are swarming the small entrance gate trying to get through the metal detectors, but the staff is either only making announcements in Hungarian, or shooing people at the front away unless it's their exact tour time. We decided to do the \"exhibit\" with an \"audio guide\" instead, but this was basically a couple of small rooms with some historical artifacts and a terrible boring audio accompaniment. The TV screens \"aren't working yet\" since this is new, and so it wasn't much to see. Basically, show up early and try to get a ticket for an early morning tour of the inside if you can. Otherwise, don't bother."

It should be noted that as long as there's availability (which there was even the day before we went) it's really easy to change your time slot on the online booking system. With regard to the tour itself our guide was very good and led us on a relatively short tour (it took about 40 minutes) around the building. There are quite a lot of steps to walk up at the start (but there was an option to get a lift if needed). You also get to see the crowd jewels (guarded by guards) as part of this tour and the beautiful dome and chandelier in the central part of the building. Overall I think it's a must see when in Budapest. It's such a prominent feature on the bank of the pest side of the Danube it's certainly worth taking the time to have a tour. especially for the cost which was only 2000 HUF each."

You can also walk here easily from the centre along the river taking time to view the 'shoes' memorial on the river bank. You need to book to get onto the limited places available for the English speaking tours. Booked this online from the hotel and they printed the tickets for me which was really helpful. Once inside you get to see some of the iconic sights like the golden stair case and the Hungarian Crown Jewels. Worth doing and only takes an hour so plenty of time to walk along to Castle hill along the river bank, across the bridge and up the funicular to have lunch by St Matthias' church and look at the view back to the Parliament building!"

I visited in mid-June, before the main rush of tourists, and simply walked in and bought a ticket on the spot with no problem. Tickets are also sold at the usual tourist offices.The crown of King Saint Stephen is on display, but photographs are not allowed, which is a bit annoying.To take the standard tourist photograph, you have to go on a boat on the Danube, preferably at sunset - otherwise you cannot get far enough away to fit the whole building into a photo.There is an excellent caf\u00e9 on-site."

The fact that it is the first thing you see when walking out of Kossuth Lajos metro station really does take you back a step, during the week it is surprisingly quiet as well. A truly remarkable building in terms of sheer grand scale is a must see for anyone visiting the city. In addition to this the Shoes on the Danube memorial is just 5 minutes down the river on the promenade, and the Hungarian folk and culture museum is directly opposite. Both of these are well worth visiting. We had planned to take a quick look around the museum but ended up spending 3 hours there before walking down to the dock for the evening danube cruise."

Thru listening to the group they had a 9:45 tour so felt safe we had not missed the tour. It was almost 10 before anyone came out and then they announced they were only looking for 9:45 English tour ticket holders. Nothing said about timing for those with other tickets, but again figured if they just took the 9:45 tour they would get to 10. Which yes they did but you are standing not in a line but a cluster with everyone new coming along wondering why they can't go in and with different cultures with different ideas of personal space a bit of pushing even tho you tried to explain not yet. The 2-3 hours I recommended is for the tour and walking around outside. Bonus, there is a bathroom just outside the entrance which is free."

It's well-hidden and several locals we asked directed us instead to the House of Terrors but it is one of two underground museums; the other has details of some of the renovations to Parliament (we think).

You can only enter the building by being part of a guided tour group, and before you do you have to go through the security. We booked our tickets online, but you can buy tickets there as well. The Parliament is just as stunning from the inside as it is from the outside. Our guide was very good as well. The only thing is that they are a bit disorganized. Our tour was to start at 13:00, so you would expect from them to gather us all 15 minutes earlier, but that didn't happen. So not knowing what to do, we all started queuing to go through the security alongside people who had their tours in other languages, and waited to see what happens. At one point we were called by our guide, left the queue, told a few details, and then asked to go through the security, but by this time instead of two queues like we formed half an hour ago, they ended up with 5 queues trying to get through two security checkpoints. Also, once in the Parliament it would be a good idea to wait 10 minutes for the group before to finish their first part of the tour, because on few occasions we ended up with the German group in the same room, so it was hard to focus and hear what our guide was saying as they were both talking at the same time."

I felt myself thinking that even the Taj Mahal could not rival this building. Do be forewarned that if you plan to see the interior, you absolutely must purchase your tickets well in advance. My friend and I attempted to purchase our tickets around noon and were told that they were all sold out! Even though we weren't able to tour the interior, we were allowed to tour the grounds for free. If you take the riverboat taxi/tour, which we did, you will be able to get your best photos."

A hotel concierge can assist with this, or you can do it yourself on-line. I recommend not doing this in person unless it is a last resort. During high season, queues can be long.It is possible to take photos without flash of the interior, there is one area that includes a crown where it is not possible and you will be clearly told this when you approach that area.This is appropriate for both children and adults.

The number of tours in each language depends on demand so there may be lots in English and German for example but fewer in French. Make sure you book your ticket early so that during the winter months your tour is during daylight, because some areas of the interior are dimly lit to save energy and you can't appreciate the impressive stained glass at night. If you're from an EEC country you get a huge (more than 50%) discount off your entry ticket, but you must produce your passport to qualify, so don' forget to take it with you!It's also worth taking a boat trip to see the building from the river. These trips are cheap and plentiful from the numerous landing stages, they take about an hour and you can even get a beer onboard for about \u00a31 so are a good way of taking a bit of a rest from walking!"

Amazing building!! a whole story..We bought the ticket online because we thought that it would be a line bu no..there was no line so we just got in with the english spoken group.. Ticket costs around 7E and in the beggining you have to go upstairs about 200 or more stairs if i remember good. the whole touring took about 20minutes. it was amazing all the building but you can't see all... just some rooms.. My opinion is that with those 7 euros of the ticket you can enter the Acropolis museum in Athens and see the whole museum..not just some rooms...so, for me apart from being amazing, i would propose the outside fotos only..."

We went to the left hand side and almost missed our tour because the guards told us to walk (run) round to the other side, not allowing us to cut through, and the building is enormous.

With the recent restoration of the surrounding square it is magnificently situated and is the largest building in Hungary. It was built between 1884 and 1902, based on the Neo-Gothic architecture of the Palace of Westminster in London but is far more striking and symmetrical. The nearest metro is at Kossuth ter. There is a modern visitor centre where tickets for guided group tours in a given language can be obtained and the guides are very informative. Tickets for European visitors at 2000 Huf are considerably cheaper than those for non-Europeans. We had to wait an hour before our tour so we visited the adjacent cafeteria for coffee and then strolled around the exterior of the building. The Parliament was designed for an Upper and Lower House when it opened but the current government National Assembly meets in what was the upper house and the lower house is fully open to the public. The Hungarian crown jewels are displayed and guarded under the central atrium and dome in the only location where photography is not allowed. This building is the jewel in the crown of a beautiful city."

The tour itself was conducted in a very efficient manner once the tour party all passed through the security check. It starts with a 133 step climb up a staircase which eventually leads to the grand entrance hall. Behind that the royal crown is displayed in the center of a room under the dome and is guarded by two soldiers in ceremonial dress.Total duration of tour is about 40 minutes. Bring your passport if you are a from an EU country because there is a substantial discount offered off the regular admission price. Highly recommended part of your visit to Budapest."

You also felt like the tour was rushed because there were other tour groups right behind you who needed to be shown the same thing. In addition, the tour itself was too short and lacked substantial information to merit the price of the tour (Price differs between citizens of E.U and non-E.U countries).

We visited the place during the Redbull Air Show and we could only purchase tickets online because they told us that they might be sold out until we get there next (we wanted to visit the place on Saturday but they were sold out, so they advise us to come back the next day and purchase the tickets online). When we bought the tickets only we were overcharged with an \"internet tax\" which was quite high (I cannot remember the exact amount).The next day when we went there, we had to wait over 20 minutes over the scheduled time before we could go in, thing which kind of pissed me off.Anyway, we finally got in!  We were quite dissapointed by the tour, as it was faster that is was supposed to be (they were already late) and we were dissapointed by the interior design if the place. All I could remark it was the opulence and extravagancy of the building! We did not find it an historical place, as we could even be attentive to the guide's explanations because we very so distracted by the blinking of the gold everywhere you looked. Everything was so\"in your face\" and extravagant and just too much, a mix of arhitectonic features and different styles.Per total, I think it was a waste of money and time and I do not recommend you to visit it! Do something with your time"

It was a National Holiday - 20 Aug - when you can have an quick unguided visit to parts of the Parliament House. If you are there at that time and that is eniugh for you go for it. Alternative, you can visit it in a guided tour. They offer them in many languages at different times. Getting ethe tickets for the guided tour is a bit difficult!1./ You pay more if you are not from an EU country though! 2./ You can purchase tickets in person but be prepared that you might not get in right away as the sessions booked out and have to come back later or wait there.3./ You can NOT book in person for next day session ONLY on line for an extra fee!That makes it difficult and very disappointing when you try to see this wonderful building you see all over the TV when they advertise river cruises. They built the Parliament House entirely from building materials sourced in Hungary, except the marbles which came from Italy! Parliament is symmetrical and has two absolutely identical parliament halls out of which one is used for the politics, the other one is used for guided tours. It has 691 rooms and its height of 96 meters, it is one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest, along with Saint Stephen's Basilica. The number 96 refers to the nation's millennium, 1896, and the conquest of the later Kingdom of Hungary in 896. The Holy Crown of Hungary has been displayed in the central hall since 2000.TIP: if you have to wait or feeling a bit hungry go in to the Kossuth metro station - do not go downstairs or buy metro ticket - and there is this small bakery franchise with cheap but nice little food to munch on. You find these all over the city at many metro stops ( they are called Princess ) including here."

We visited the commons room, a balcony with an amazing skyline of Budapest as well as various other parts of the parliament building.

I'd say that if you do go, just go for any language tour as for the English one seemed a bit dull. It is very stunning, so I'd probably say go visit it if I'm pushed into a yes/no decision."

I then printed out the receipt so I would have the bar code and reservation time and date. Let me just say to be very careful about the time and date that you make your reservation. We made ours for the day of arrival in Budapest and I should have made the reservation for the next day. We made it by 5 minutes!

View from the outside as the tour we took and booked 2 days in advance for a Monday tour which was not worth the $25p.p. .paid for a 45 mins.tour of which took 15 mins to clear security where everyone had to put all their belongings including coats, jacket through the security scanner. Basically what we heard I could have read on internet if you could hear at all since the group is so large. True inside is magnificent to see but the tour was so short that I think everyone expected to see more and were surprised the tour was over. Definitely not worth the money paid. Don't know how Jeff got close to an hour tour. We were told in advance the tour was only 45 mins. and this of course is without factoring at least min.10 mins for security check.If you do book thru your iphone and cannot print out your tickets, all you do is take take your iphone with the email confirmation ahead of time to the clerk at the information desk and she will print out the tickets for you. We did not know this in advance and had to go to ask at the Parliament information desk and ask. You can only purchase same tickets but most likely all the tickets for English will be sold out. You also cannot purchase advance tickets at the information desk. They tell you to purchase tickets on line yourself and they will print the tickets for you if you cannot print them out yourself.I also would not have paid so much money for so little if I knew what I know now."

I found it hard to fathom any measure of indifference one could retain when faced with such lavishness and magnificence. There was gold leaf by the kilogram gilding the relief moldings of every column pedestal. Entire walls were constructed of pink and blue marble throughout the massive domed structure. Inaugurated during the illustrious but fleeting reign of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (an early 1900\u2019s world power), Hungary\u2019s parliament majestically overlooks the River Danube. Well-organized tours are offered throughout the complex, in a variety of languages, including sneak peaks into the working parliamentary rooms. The jewel in the crown of the tour, quite literally, is the medieval gold crown of Saint Stephen, which is on display but guarded 24/7 under the dome of the colossal gothic legislative edifice.Nevertheless, my wife contends that this is of no interest to my brother-in-law. A few weeks before we arrived in Budapest my American kin traveled thousands of miles to join a cruise where he apparently declined to visit all the main attractions, including the magnificent St. Stephen\u2019s Cathedral, Parliament, the palace, and countless other wonders of Austro-Hungaro historical significance. I wait eagerly to read the detailed review of his room.Sometime back in the 1600\u2019s, the treasured crown was locked away in a box in a bad way, bending its cross. At the onset of World War II it was stored at Fort Knox and only by controversial presidential decree was it returned to its rightful place of origin. Jimmy Carter is a rock star in these parts."

Very much enjoyed seeing the facilities, and when we visited, the elevator was broken so we got to see even more as we had to move through the normally closed off staircases and corridors. Of particular note was the great accessories for the king (sword, crown, etc.) stored in the middle of the building!"

It sits along the bank of the Danube. Make sure as you walk back toward the heart of Budapest to do it along the Danube so you don't miss the Shoes on the Danube only about 150-200 yards away. This memorial is to honor the Jews who were ordered to take off their shoes, shot at the waters edge so their bodies fell in the river and carried away. It is so moving!Don't miss it or Budapest!!!"

We went there last weekend and altough we just walked there in the evening from Margaret Island, the whole view was amazing. As we were walking by the beautiful Danube getting closer and closer to the building, it became more and more spectacular. The sight when the whole building lit up with yellow lights is eye-catching. You can even feel the power of the enormous edifice as you walk in front of it. The dome and the walls in the evening lights..breathtaking. The hungarian Parliament has a lot of history, take time do a little research before visiting. Can\u2019t wait to take a boat ride to see it from the river. Already prepared my camera. It\u2019ll be unique I\u2019m sure."

The visitors center where you can book / buy your tickets is located underground next to the Nothern side of the building, clearly marked.

The only way to get inside is to follow a guided tour, and the price is much higher for people from outside the EU. Also, one has to go through a security check like at the airport, and if the guided groups are full there is no way to get in, so it is best to get tickets a few hours before and then walk around the outside, or look at something else for a bit. There is also a caf\u00e9 which I did not try. Anyway, this means visiting takes a lot more time than the tour itself.The tour isn't very long. It is interesting if you are interested in history, politics or architecture, but in some way the impressiveness of the building becomes less impressive simply because it was built to impress. Still, it is beautiful, and visitors are allowed to take pictures in all but one room on the tour.For the visitor with less time or less interest in buildings, just take a walk around it or enjoy the view from theBuda side or one of the bridges."

Purchased my ticket from the www.jegymester.hu site before hand, and though the tour is expensive for Budapest (specially for non-EU citizens), I think spending the extra 200 forint to pre-order is worth it. You guarantee yourself a time and you don't have to stand in a purchase line (long one when I was there) when you arrive, then maybe have to come back later in the day (was there for a 10:00 am tour and they were selling afternoon tickets). You find the tour entrance at the North end of the square, down a wide set of stairs. One complaint, it would be nice if they had electronic sign specifying which tour was going through the security scanners, instead of just someone trying to talk above the crowd. Security did not take long, as it should be a breeze if you spend any time watching the looping security films playing on a number of TVs in the lobby. Further, with security, you will be escorted by two guards throughout the building. The female member of our accompanying pair came armed with strong eye-roll ability for those barely paying attention to instructions as to where we were supposed to go.You start with a bit of a stair climb (though elevators are also available) and you are immediately struck by the extravagance you would expect from, what I grew up calling, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. I found the Hungarian part left off during my visit not just in Budapest, but also in Krakow and Prague. The tour was quite smooth, with the timed entry stopping any area from getting crowded. And our tour guide was an experienced hand who really knew her material. Outside, it is such a fabulous landmark. Be it from the square itself or from the Fisherman's Bastion across the Danube or while floating along the river. It is particularly beautiful when lit up at night."

The exterior is an architectural jewel in the daylight. In the evening, the structure is brightly illuminated, showing the lovely design and attention to detail. The inside is equally well designed and appointed. All of the many large stained glass windows and statues, the huge stairways, the long hallways and the vaulted and highly decorated ceilings throughout the Parliament Building are all spectacular! The General Assembly Hall is large, well decorated and impressive. Many visitors were surprised to see the numbered cigar holders in the hallway outside the General Assembly Hall. The crown jewels of Hungary are available for viewing, but unfortunately no photos are allowed in this room. Happily, photos are allowed everywhere else at the Parliament building. We were lucky to be able to view the Parliament Building at night from the Danube while on a very pleasant evening dinner cruise.It is well worth a guided tour see the gorgeous interior and to learn about the importance of this building in the history of Hungary."

It's not just about the building and architecture (although amazing) but about Hungarian history. I loved the cigar holders outside the chambers.Of course you need to experience it outside, all the way around the building - day time and night time when it's lit up and looks like a fantasy.

Look out for the brass ashtrays where members of the Lords left their cigars while going to hear a speech. You will see St Stephen's Crown and the Coronation Regalia: there is a lot of folklore attached to these. Hungarian fascists took the crown to Germany but after many apparent adventures it ended up in Fort Knox. It was returned to Hungary in 1978.The best place to purchase a ticket is at the visitors' Centre near the Parliament itself. You can buy on the web but contray to what it may say it is not cheaper that way. The best is to arrive early in the morning and book accordingly, especially as tours do not always go in the language you want at the time you thought was advertised! We purchased an English tour ticket at 10.15 for the 12.15 tour. Note: English speaking in our experience included many Australians, Americans and other language speakers who could not get a tour in their own language but understood English.There is a cafe in the Visitors' centre (not specially good for Budapest), and toilets, but the ones outside do not require payment."

At a certain point the guards change position with each other in a small ceremony. I did find it a little disconcerting, as their uniforms resemble Nazi uniforms or those worn by soldiers of Cold War communist countries. It didn't help when they goose stepped around the crown.As Parliament was in session, we did get to see only one chamber of the building.There is an elevator for those who cannot walk up the 132 steps to get in."

The location makes it even more enchanting as it falls along the banks of the Danube on the Pest side and one can get fantastic views from the Fisherman's bastion or the boat tour. At night one can spot white birds (not sure which) are circling the building once its lit up."

Inside guided tours can visit half of it, the one which is not used by the members of the Parliament, but is exactly the same as the other one. The highlight of the tour is the Crown, an important national symbol of Hungary. The whole tour takes about 45 minutes and, contrary to what is written on their website, there are English tours much more often than just three times a day. It's probably best to buy your tickets online in advance, but as for the beginning of October, there were no queues and I bought mine on the spot. Also you need to go through airport-like security control, but they allow liquid containers."

When we got inside the Parliament area where the tour tickets had to be purchased there were hundreds of people in this area. We had to wait for at least twenty minutes to get our tour tickets. There were tours given in different languages and organizing the people into their different tour groups was a hectic and disorganized affair. Everyone had to go through a security check and this delayed everyone even more. Groups of tourists again had to be re-organized according to the language the tour was to be given in once everyone got through the security check. This was a long process and was somewhat disorganized and frustrating. Eventually our English group was collected and were able to start the tour. The Parliament is a glorious building with a tremendous history. We could not see every aspect of the Parliament since it was in session and some rooms were out of bounds to tours. However, what was seen was impressive. The tour lasted about an hour and was worth seeing. The disorganized start is something that should be rectified somehow to make it more pleasant for people taking the tour. Our tour was at 1:00 P.M. Perhaps earlier or latter tours are not as disorganized. Try to stay away from mid-day tours at the Parliament."

Tours are generally sold out early (especially the English-speaking ones), so plan to get there early or better yet reserve in advance. They last about 30 - 40 minutes, show you most of the interiors and give just enough history to be interesting and not so much as to be boring. If you happen to be near the Parliament in the afternoon, watching the removal of the flag is also quite interesting. Between the inside tour, walking around the outside grounds, and exploring the gift shop, budget about 3 hours if you have a pre-booked tour."

You can book the tour of the Parliament in different languages and at different times online at jegymester.hu (official site).EU citizens pay HUF 2,000 p.p.The tour guides are friendly and knowledgable. We found the 50-minutes tour very interesting, certainly worthwhile.The building is spectacular from the outside too. The Hungarian flag is risen in the morning and carried away in the evening, and changing of the guard happens frequently. It's all rather pompous.The huge building is easily recognizable from the Buda side, or from the Danube. Especially beautiful at night."

We went on the tourist tour of the inside of the parliament. We only saw two staircases, two hallways and two rooms. I am not making this up, this is indeed what we saw. The whole tour lasted some 15, 20 min. We were highly disappointed. The tour is way to short and they don't show you much.In Bucharest the parliament tour lasts much, much longer and they show you more than 2 rooms, 2 hallways and 2 staircases. If you have never been inside a parliament like this before, sure, go ahead, but if you have then save your money and don't go because it's simply not worth the money and the 20 minutes you lose."

If ever there was a monument to wasteful and excessive expenditure, this is it.And yet, I have to admit it is magnificent. Ornate beyond belief, it is summed up by a parliamentary chamber built for about double the number of members who currently occupy it. No expense has been spared, either on the outside or inside.You can't miss this if you are in Budapest. However, note that, in order to get inside, you have to be on a guided tour, and these sell out very fast, so that it is a good idea to book on the internet or via your hotel concierge, as soon as you arrive. There are tours in most languages, and English tours are reasonably frequent through the day, but very popular. You can sometimes get a ticket for a later tour by arriving at 9am, but I wouldn't count on it. It will also mean a long wait till your tour starts.If you do have a wait for your tour to start, or if you have 30 mins to spare after the tour, visit the terribly sad \"Memorial of the Shoes\" situated on the Danube as a tribute to the Jews killed by the Arrow Cross soldiers who formed a Nazi allied government after the German occupation. It is about 10 mins walk from the Parliament.We were lucky enough to see the building both by night and day, and it was equally impressive. If you are there at noon, there is a pleasant changing of the guard ceremony, after which the soldiers mingled with the crowd for photographic opportunities."

When we went into the Lord's chamber, the guide was standing within the seating area and we were behind a barrier. The guide was referring to things on the walls that could only be seen from her perspective and we could not see them at all. The security guards were also very scruffy and rude. I a was also surprised that the tickets for non EU nations las was 5200 HUF rather than just 2000 HUF for EU nationals.

The inside is gorgeous and decorated with all kinds of designs all over. The crown of Hungary is also on display inside since it is a requirement to always display it in a public place. Since there were so many people going through on that day my group was rushed through and only spent about 20 minutes looking at everything. Not sure how long the typical tour takes. You are not allowed to take pictures inside, especially no pictures of the crown."

There is a number of stairs to climb, but the guide gives you the opportunity to use a lift and avoid the stairs. The guide is knowledgeable and well practised. The gift shop is also a very high standard and there is a cafe and public toilets. The only negative is that finding the visitor centre was tricky as its steps go down on the northern side of the building, so are not visible if you approach from the south side. I could not see any signs to direct you to the visitor centre, but a friendly palace guard helped. Also near the parliament building on the south side there are some steps leading down to a memorial to the 1956 revolution, which was very interesting."

The building is more like a cathedral than a government building. There were over 100 steps to climb to get to the primary viewing areas. No worries though. If that's an issue, the guide will let those who can't do the physical climb use an elevator. There were a lot of people on our tour. As a result, it wasn't always easy to hear our guide.

We bought our tickets, but then had 75 minutes to spare till the tour started. To kill the time, we walked over to the neighboring Museum of Ethnography and did a quick visit there. It was interesting, inexpensive and kept us out of the hot sun.The Parliament tour lasted 45 minutes, but 15 minutes were wasted filing through the security gate (which you do as a group).

I would recommend researching tour times so that you don\u2019t have to come back to this place again just to take the tour.Inside tour: You have to see it to believe it. The inside of the parliament is like a palace. They even show you the house of commons and photography is permitted inside."

The facade has been cleaned and the stonework is an amazing piece of architecture.The height of it is 96 metres to the top of the dome.Tickets for the visits sell out quickly. The entry price is 2,000 Forints for an adult and 1,000 Forints for a child of school going age. These prices are as at August 2015 and for those holding a European Union passport. So you need to take your passport when you buy your tickets. Non European Union visitors pay higher prices. We obtained our tickets around 9.30am in the morning for an English guided tour that started at 3.45pm. It goes without saying that you have to go through an airport style security check before you enter. Then you climb up 132 steps to get to the main area. You will be amazed by the stained glass and the beautiful architecture. The Parliament chamber itself is fantastic and is arranged in a U shape with some beautiful furniture.You also get some great views of the Danube River from one side of the Parliament building.The tour lasts about 30 minutes and is definitely worth it.There is a cafe on the ground floor that sells a range of sandwiches and hot and cold drinks - at an inflated price.The gift and souvenir shop sells a range of items - again at inflated prices."

The English language tour was large, and it took some time to get everyone through security, but once the tour started it was very interesting. You are allowed to take photos everywhere EXCEPT around the Crown Jewels, and a guard will quickly let you know if you reach for your camera! The tour lasts around 45 minutes, and you must keep up with the tour guide. The area around the Parliament is huge, and seems to be a meeting point. Be sure to visit the \"shoes\" as it is close by."

Contrary to even recent guide books you don't get in up the main steps, but through a visitor centre to the right of the building as you face the river. Visits are in groups only, with a guide in your chosen language at different times. It's worth booking in advance for popular languages (like English!) as they book up quickly, but the booking desk was very helpful in my case and booked me onto a German tour with spaces, that had an English tour going at the same time that I managed to sidle over to. The guide spoke good English and was very informative about the political system and the building itself, which is beautiful both inside and out. Very well worth the visit."

Rooms and corridor halls were decorated with gold pillars and red carpeting. Assembly hall was impressive and showed us Hungarian crown jewel. Pictures are allowed except for 1 room. The dome with the crown jewel guessed by 2 Hungarian army guards. Overall tour is rather short but concise and full explanation of purpose of the parliament and each of the rooms shown. FYI. Booked in advance. If not you will not allowed to go on any tour or entrance. "

If youre european you'll receive half price or if you're a european student even more discount, if you're not european you'll have to pay 5000 HUF for 45 min of tour. Which I think is too much considering the quality of the tour and the time.Our guide had a horrible english, we could barely understand her and also seemed she was in a hurry, she never let us stop to take pictures or to admire the building, she was always walking and walking. Pictures are allowed in all places of the building except in the dome where the crown is placed.An advice is to buy the tickets in internet, you can be lucky and find places available for that same day if not you'll have to buy them for another day and this means you'll loose a lot of time. The parlament is amazing but I'd to put 3 stars for the tour and the guide, as this is the only way to visit the building it should be a very good visit, with more time and better quality, also considering the prize you've to pay."

When we finally got through, we were in a very large group of about 40 people and the lady who presented the tour would begin speaking (very quickly which made it difficult to understand!) in the next area before the rest of the group had caught up. I thought that they would show us some more areas of Parliament as we were only shown into about 3 different areas.

If you have the time you have to take the guided tour. You have to get there early in the morning because they have limited groups and the tickets sell out especially at peak times. The wood work on the inside is fantastic and the main chambers and the grand halls are impressive. This is a time machine which takes you back to a time when Europe and the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was flourishing before the Great War. A ten year renovation and cleaning of the outside of the building was completed a couple of years ago and it is now scaffolding free. It is a must see!

This is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary, and is the highest and largest building in the country.The building is located on the Pest side of the Danube, at Kossuth Lajos Square. You can reach the building on Line 2 of the Budapest Metro, and with the Line 2 tram. The building is fantastic!! The only way you can get inside is by buying a tour ticket. It\u2019s advisable to pre-purchase your tickets online [at Jegymester.hu\u2026this means Ticketmaster.hu in Hungarian]. The English-speaking tours are limited in number every day, and they sell out quickly. You might luck out and be able to buy a ticket at the new Visitor Center when you get there, but I\u2019ve been disappointed by trying to buy tickets at the last minute. The tour guide clips along pretty quickly, so get your camera ready! The main staircase is magnificent, and the assembly halls are splendid. Look for the cigar holders along the window sills. The Crown Jewels in the Dome Hall are spectacular. However, you can\u2019t get too close to them, and photos of the jewels are not allowed. Also note that when parliament is in sessions, and other official receptions are taking place, the guided tours are cancelled or postponed without advance notice. And, Parliament is closed on Hungarian holidays. Do your homework about dates before you order tickets to avoid disappointment."

The tour itself is fine -- we had about 25 people in our group. The rooms we visited were worthwhile seeing but I wouldn't say that this is a \"must do\" in Budapest.

Neo gothic turrets, pinnacled gables, ornamental staircases, stained glass windows and gothic arches embellish its white face along with statues of prominent military and royal members of Hungary. The domed Assembly Hall and the rest of the interior is done very artistically. The building can be seen at it's best from the Danube or from the Buda side at night, when most of the interior lights are turned on.

The queue for security (bag checks etc) was a nightmare and not organised at all, people for all tours were queuing at the same time and there was frustration and people were reaching the front of the queue only to be told that it was not time for them to go through security yet. We finally were told it was our time to go through by a woman shouting at us. We finally got through security at about 1.10pm then had to wait another 10 mins in a holding area before our tour started. We set off only a couple of minutes behind a German tour so it was difficult to concentrate at times as we could hear the German tour guide over ours. The total tour time was around 35 minutes and in this time we whizzed around the main corridor, saw the crown jewels and main staircase and briefly visited the main parliament. We were surprised when our guide announced this was the end of the tour as we were expecting a lot more.The exterior parliament building is spectacular and I recommend an evening visit when it is illuminated."

A few worthy tips:- Make sure you have enough Hungarian Forints (currency) with you to purchase a ticket. They do not accept Euros, only Forint or credit card. As a non-EU person, the fee was 5,200 Forint (around 16 euros). - If you do not have Forint with you, you can purchase something with Euros at the Parliament cafe. They will return you change in Forint (I had to do this). The money changer is a 10 minute walk away).- Book your tickets online, in advance. They sell out fast! Or, like me, wait at the entrance at 8am in the morning (there were already 10 people when I got there). Then quickly queue up to buy a ticket.It is worth the visit! You are allowed to take photos. There are 2 guards who guard the royal crown; it is quite a sight.The outside is stunning as well, of course. Visit at night, when the Parliament lights up -- stunning!"

(the view of it all lit up from the river at night is wonderful). The building is definitely worth seeing, but I was a bit disappointed with the tour itself.

In front is an underground exhibition (free to enter) remembering the 1956 attempt at freedom from communism. Very thought provoking and well presented. As we left there were small cooling sprays in the floor of the square which were very welcome. We were then treated to a guard's ceremonial display (Sunday at approx 10:30). Very impressive area that was not busy so plenty of space to take photos and take in the amazing building."

We visited Vienna first, so the history of Austro-Hungarian empire meant more to us because of that. I loved the figurines depicting the many different occupations of Hungarian people. The inaugural crown w its bent cross from the 11th century is displayed. Yes, this is THE top attraction to see in Budapest.

After passing through security, our guide gave us a detailed tour and we were able to see the chambers of Parliament, the marble columns, the ornate decor, the murals in the antechambers to Parliament and more. A visit to Parliament, however, is not complete without viewing the building from the Danube. Make sure you take a Danube River Cruise at some point to see the building in all its magnificent glory both during the day and all lit up at night."

These are run throughout the day in several languages. You need to plan ahead and book before you go if you want a tour at a time, day and in a language of your choice. If you are an EU citizen you only have to pay 2000fts.I didn't plan ahead so ended up on the 8.45 morning tour. You have to pass through security so think about what's in your bags before you go. Once through security the tour gets off to a brisk start, taking you up a golden staircase to the impressive corridors of the main building. The tours only last about 40 minutes and you are free to take photos in most areas. The guide was interesting and witty throughout. The highlights include the Dome Room (absolutely NO PHOTOS here) where you see the crown of the Kings of Hungary guarded by two guards who will carry out. As all ceremony while you are there; the chamber of the abolished Upper House is a mirror image of the lower chamber (which you don't get to see) and is well worth a visit; and my favourite part, the story of the cigar holders. If you can get on a tour it is well worth it."

It is located on the Pest side on the bank of river Danube. The construction started in 1885 and completed on 1904. The Parliament building is a magnificent example of Gothic architecture. It is also the third largest Parliament building in the world and second largest in Europe. We did not go inside, although that is possible with prior appointment.

Inside the building is like a jewerly: only the best and most expensive materials were used, and already back in 1896 was used \"air condinationing\" (via the air vent cold air was coming produced by huge blocks of ice) and was one of the first building having built in electric elevators.

I have booked a guided tour online and the price was great - about \u00a311.00 for two tickets (EU citizens - but we did not have to show our passports to anybody). The building is amazing and the tour was one of the highlights of our trip to Budapest. We have seen some of the rooms in the building and photography was allowed everywhere but the Great Dome. However the tour was a little bit rushed as there were lots of other groups and no explanation during the Change of the Guards was given. The queuing system is a little bit erratic as there is no information provided if you had printed your tickets earlier. Just remember to come 5 minutes before the time of your tour and you will be fine."

It\u2019s located in the Pest side in the bank of the Danube and is 268 meters long and 96 meters high in the central dome. The Hungarian parliament is one the biggest and oldest legislative buildings in the world. Imre Steindl used the English one as an inspiration. The building is beautiful and is inspiring to look at from every possible angle. Inside it is full of details, golden ornaments and beautiful rooms. The tour will guide you through the these rooms and sights which include the Holy Crown, the magnificent staircase and the session room. Our guide was very knowledgeable and seem to really enjoy her work, which only made the tour more interesting.TIP: If you want to visit the inside (and you should) you can reserve the tour online \u2013 you will save time, money and guarantee your ticket. In peak seasons the tickets sell out quickly."

Tours last 45 minutes which is enough time to get the grandeur of the place without droning on and on. You see the crown jewels of Hungary, the grand staircase, the overall feel of the building, the Parliament meeting rooms. Only problem we had was trying to book a tour online. We are staying in an apartment and were thus unable to print a reservation so could not get an online spot. Made it a longer process when we arrived, but overall was still a great experience."

It is large; very, very large. It is worth seeing from all 4 sides.There is also a display by the parliament guards at exactly 12:30 pm. 5 guards march to some recorded music on the front steps. They finish on the paved area below and allow photo opportunities once finished.Not to be missed sight in Budapest.Fee for the tour inside, but no cost outside or for the marching display."

It is more than 100 years old and is the third largest Parliament building in the world, easily rivaling the British Parliament in London, England. It is located on the Pest side of BudapestThis building is one of the must see sight when one visits Budapest. The magnificent building is transformed to a spectacular sight at night when it is fully lit from the outside. It is a symmetrical building housing the two former bicameral National Assembly on each side. Presently, the National assembly is unicameral. The architecture is of the Neo-Gothic design with some Renaissance and Baroque flavour. the Hungarian crown jewels are housed under the main dome (photography not allowed). Guided tours are available when the parliament is not in session. the tour lasts about 45 minutes and costs about 5500 HUF (for non-EU citizens). Best way to book a tour is on line normally obtainable from the concierge desk of various major hotels in the area. Don't miss this attraction along the Danube in Budapest especially at night."

The limestone building is massive, yet delicate. Outside are many large statues of notable Hungarian figures. This building is comparable to the Parliament building in London and its design was inspired in part by it. However, we feel the Budapest Parliament is a bit more elegant.It is right on the Danube River, which only adds to its beauty. Actually seeing the Parliament Building from a boat is wonderful way to view it.Inside you could be overwhelmed by the opulence, the gilding everywhere, the beautiful paintings, the large halls the long corridors, the central dome. The building has over 600 rooms.This is a not-to-be-missed site in Budapest. Highly recommended."

Order tickets online or expect to wait for a tour in your language.

For example, up floe you can see the how tiny the man is cleaning the building. That said, the Parliament really shines at night when it is fully lighted.

The reddish dome against the white is distinctive and magnificent up close and from a distance.To see the interiors you have to join one of the guided tours. These are pretty expensive, especially if you pay the non-EU rate (a whopping 5200HUF). Note that if you are not an EU citizen but reside in the EU and have eg a visa to show it, you should be able to buy an EU ticket which is considerably cheaper (2000HUF).It seems that in peak season you need to buy your tickets at least a couple of hours in advance (eg we we arrived in the morning the first available tour in English was about 2 hours later). If you want to avoid delayed entry you can buy tickets online (small administration fee of 200HUF per ticket).As some people have commented, the guided tour is pretty quick but it is worth paying for the ticket to go in - the exteriors of the Parliament house are opulent, and the ceiling of the dome room where the crown jewels are housed is breathtaking. Unfortunately you can't take photos in the dome room, but photos are allowed everywhere else."

I am expecting more of the architecture of the interior design and interesting locations or history within the buiding, considering the external of the parliament looks majestic. Nevertheless, I have to give credit to the English speaking tour guide as her speech is clear and structured. In conclusion, others might find this attraction interesting but it is just not my cup of tea. If you are into the history of the development of the whole city, I would recommend the history museum at the Buda castle."

Walk around to the area where refreshing cool air/mist sprays out each hour (or more often) & enjoy the sensation of the spray in the summer months!

Then we had to wait in a queue while tour guides were allowed to go to the front and take ages to ask their questions This caused resentment because anyone at the back of the queue who has phone access can book ahead of those at the front. Not very fair!! We were given a slot in the afternoon but when we arrived there was no indication where we should gather or indeed if we were in the right place. Our guide duly appeared but she did not give us instructions. By following others who were in our group we eventually found we had to go through security and then on to the tour. Our guide stopped every so often to explain about the beautiful building but she did not wait until everyone was there. It was not possible to get to the front because you were just in a line. It was a shame not to hear what was said some of the time. Having said all that we were glad we got on the tour and enjoyed seeing the inside of the building. It was only the lack of organisation that spoilt out visit so don't let me put you off going, just book on line if you can."

This time around we ordered e-tickets online at jegymester.hu while still at home and printed them ourselves. The tickets for EU citizens cost 2000 Ft / person (about 6\u20ac) plus a service charge 400 Ft, for the non-EU citizens the price would've been 5200 Ft / person. We booked an English tour, which all start at the Visitor Center located \"underground\" on the right-hand side of the building (when standing in front of it), on the opposite side of the building than Kossuth Lajos t\u00e9r subway station (M2). You should arrive at the Visitor Center 15 minutes before your tour, which we did, and then the tour guide first guided you through a security check similar to an airport. A guard also followed us all through the tour.The first part of the actual tour was either to take the elevator upstairs or climb up quite a few stairs, which we wholeheartedly recommend as the staircase is beautiful, and the ceiling is made of real gold. The whole building is absolutely amazing and you just couldn't help but stop and stare all the gorgeous details. Unfortunately the tour kept us moving in such a fast pace that there really wasn't enough time to see everything we would've wanted. The fast pace also meant that as we weren't the greediest ones to take the front row when the tour guide was talking, we didn't hear everything she said, or see everything she was talking about until the group had moved on. Still, the building itself was worth it. The Main Staircase and the Dome Hall were just beautiful, as were pretty much all the rooms and even the corridors.One thing about the Dome Hall, it is the only place in the building you can't take pictures in. But that wasn't a problem for us since we found a booklet of the Parliament with great pictures at the gift shop after the tour.

What I particularly liked was that they under-promised and over-delivered. They warned us that we would not get to see about half of what we came to see because of high-level visitors and then, to the surprise of the guide, everything was open and we got to see everything. The guide was very good at pointing out interesting features. My only complaint was that group size was large and time allotted for taking photos was very, very short."

Many beautiful buildings exist in the world, but there are no too many featuring such an amazing architecture like this one. Although at the time it was built, Hungary was much larger (it lost approx 2/3 of its territory after WWI), I never understood why the country had to create such a huge building, and why they spent so much money on it. On the other hand it is really gorgeous, and it would be a pity not having it. The facade is just superb, decorated with statues of past Hungarian rulers, pointed arch arcades and numerous gargoyles and Neo-gothic ornaments. Its interior is even more striking than the exterior, bejeweled by Hungary's best artists of that time. Every piece has its reason; all are symbols from the Hungarian culture or history. Your jaws will hit the floor, when seeing the main entrance stairs and hall, one of the lobbies, the earlier House of Lords and the Hungarian Crown Jewels with their guards. Miraculous!Guided tours are held in all major languages, and certainly in Hungarian. A visit takes around 45 minutes, and is definitely worth the price. Be prepared for chaos, though: At the time we were there, the crowd was fairly big in the so-called Visitor Center. One had to find out where her/his group was assembling. Maybe this is the routine there. Before entering, you have to surpass a security clearance that is not less severe than at any airport. Admittance is HUF 2,000 for EU citizens (don\u2019t forget to take your ID-card or passport with you!), for non-EU citizens hefty HUF 5,200. Children and students pay less. Only a limited number of tickets are available for each tour, for that reason it makes sense purchasing online, at www.jegymester.hu/parlament. Very annoying though that instead of an online discount you will pay 10 % more, but the upside is that you will not need to queue and admission will be guaranteed. Getting there is easy: Either you take Metro No. 2 to Kossuth t\u00e9r, or the tram No. 2, which runs along the Pest side of the Danube river and has a stop at Kossuth t\u00e9r too."

And then came the highlight.....a guided tour of very probably the most beautiful parliament building in the world. You can deposit your stuff at the counter so you don't have to lug it. After the tour, when we collected our stuff, Thomas was so sweet and gave us a lot of tips for seeing the city (not that we hadn't done our homework).

The building is huge but we get to see only one half of it...the other half is identical but tourists are not allowed in as that's the seat of the government proper. They use the house of lords (which tourists get to see) if their equivalent on the other side is out of function for any reason. The guide too was great and quite chuffed by my enthusiasm. Pity one may not linger a bit more!The whole locality is wonderful so be sure to take your time and stroll around, enjoy the square itself with all it's statues (don't forget to pose with Reagan), and the cute little bridge with the man on it (it has a tale but I don't remember it), sit in the wonderful cafes and enjoy. God's own city is Budapest!"

            "review": "Stunning building well worth the okay tour. My husband and I did an English guided tour inside the Parliament building on a Saturday morning (first tour at 9h45). I had purchased the tickets online a couple days in advance; at that point, there was already limited availability. Absolutely book this as soon as you know you want to go if you need particular times.The building is impressive from the outside. The inside is stunning and ornate. Often I find the inside of palaces and even government buildings so decorated as to be gaudy, but I actually thought this was quite beautiful and impressive - so worth the somewhat steep price of the tour simply to see the inside. The tour guide was quite nice, but they book very large tours and if you don't keep up at the front it's very hard to hear the guide despite the small microphone she used. However, she didn't really impart any information that I hadn't already learned doing a bit of research myself before the trip. If you read up a little ahead of time about the building, and remember the one room where you can't take pictures, you could perhaps buy tickets for any tour if your language sold out or you wanted to go at a particular time, as the main attraction is just seeing the building. It's easy to find information about it online before you go.You can take pictures everywhere inside, even with flash, except in the center dome room where guards stand watch over the crown (but there was a quite nice postcard showing this room and the guards and the dome that you could purchase in the shop). I had an email on my phone with our tickets, but you need a PRINTED version of the tickets on paper (I think because their scanner has a hard time with phones). However, we showed up a bit early and there was no line luckily at the ticket counter and they printed our tickets for us after checking the reservation number. Best to print your tickets ahead of time if you can, otherwise leave some time to pick them up in case there is a line.Don't bring pocket knives, nail files, pepper spray, etc. as you'll have to fish them out and hand them over when you go through security to enter the building.Show up about 5 minutes early if you have your tickets printed already. It'll last about 45-50 minutes, then there is a souvenir shop (found elsewhere in the city too, Memories of Hungary I think it's called) with some nice stuff that you may want to browse afterwards. Leave a good hour for this. Also see the building at night from the river - it's also very beautiful in a different way lit up at night! You can even see it well enough from Castle Hill or the Chain Bridge at night.You do climb up stairs (I think they said it's 135?) and then down again at the end, but those who need to do so can take the lift with the guide while the group goes up with the guard. However, don't take the lift unless you absolutely need to - the first staircase you go up is the most beautiful in the building (it's something like 27 staircases - 1 beautiful, 1 ugly, the rest in between) - and you descend by the ugliest :) Definitely an actual highlight of the tour, so don't be lazy - only take the lift if you have real need. The stairs are low and not hard, nor is the pace difficult."

The moment you step out of the metro stop (if this is how you arrive), you see this massive and expansive grand babe of Budapest next to you. The Parliament building is next to the Danube and surrounded by equally majestic historic buildings. Its a working building and as you take a tour with your tour guide, you will be followed by a watchful security guard that ensures you do not wander off the dedicated areas for visitors. Their a sovenier shop and restaurant inside the building. There is an entrance ticket of about 8 Euro. A top pick of Budapest. With such grand buildings and so much much history and powerful kings who ruled beyond Hungary, you begin to understand where Hungarian arrogance comes from. In fairness to Hungarians, such arrogance is a hallmark of people who have rules others in the past"

The tour lasts about 45 minutes and only visits a handful of rooms as it is still a working building, but we saw the impressive 96 step, sweeping main staircase which leads to the Domed Hall where the crown jewels are displayed under armed guard. This was the only part of the tour where we were not allowed to take photos. The tour finishes at the hall where the Members of Parliament sit when Parliament is is session.Although the building closes to the public in the evening, it is well worth revisiting the area at night as the building looks even more impressive lit up."

English speaking tour guides are available and cost about $7.50, but you have to register in advance since the English ones fill quickly. Visitors are not admitted to ramble and tour on their own; visitors must go with a group, and veering off the path is prohibited. The tour features a stop at the top of the main entry staircase which could have lasted longer as this was magnificent in decor and regal-ness. Under the dome is housed the jeweled crown of St. Stephen and the crown jewels alongside the crown in a guarded display case. The assembly chamber is also intricate and interesting to see how their House of Lords operates. A couple of lobbies or ante-rooms with frescos on the ceilings add to the elegance of this building. All the chambers on the tour show ceilings at which are to be gawked with the gold trim, painted arches, statues of important Hungarian statesmen, kings, and 1 queen. Soooo worth the effort and time. Tour takes an hour, which was seemingly too short for such a vast building and architectural wonder."

Of all our visits to the continent, our tour guide here was the best. The English speaking group size is limited, so it was very manageable). She specifically asked people not to take pictures until she was done explaining things, then allowed plenty of time for photos at the end of each stop of the tour. It was an excellent way to allow those of us interested more in the content than snapping photos of stuff of which we had no idea of the significance or meaning to enjoy the tour and learn. Book well in advance online if possible, as tours sell out quickly. The first tour of the morning is the best bet, as the place becomes kind of a zoo later in the day. The visitor center near the main entrance sells tickets (and has a will-call window) and souvenirs and is quite easy to navigate. One of our best experiences of our trip, but not if you're not keen on European history or parliamentary process, you might want to make other destinations a higher priority. For us, it was great."

Ticket office is on the far left side of parliament if viewed from the river, downstairs. Paid 2000 ft each, reduced due to being an EU citizen (luckily we had copies of out passports on is as proof otherwise it would have been significantly more).The tour chosen was in English by a young lady who was very knowledgeable in the language and the subject. We saw the golden staircase, the main staircase, dome hall, chamber of the National Assembly and the anteroom of the house of deputies, as well as many beautiful corridors. Most importantly we saw the coronation insignia in the Dome Hall. The ancient crown is truly amazing, but please remember that no photos are allowed here. Everywhere else is fine, just not the dome hall. There is a fine guidebook available in the gift shop for 1480 ft which has far better photos than would normally be achieved anyway. Please also be cautious about standing too near the guards here, as they swing their swords every five minutes. You have been warned!You leave via part of the museum which has a scale model of Parliament. A truly amazing experience "

The tour is only a 45 minute tour where a one-fifth of the time is going through a security check. We then are taken with a tour guide who memorized lines but when it comes to asking them a question you can tell they don't know. the crown jewels were nice to see but other than that it truly was not that high price. If it was $10 US I would consider it but not for the current price.

Unmissable from both sides of the Danube, it's majestic and beautiful at the same time. Comparisons will inevitably be made about its resemblance to the Houses of Parliament in London. Indeed, the building in London did serve as the inspiration for its counterpart, the latter being inaugurated on the 1000th anniversary of the country in 1896. At over 250 metres long, the neo-Gothic building has been described as a modern palace.Fifty-minute tours of the Parliament Building are scheduled throughout the day and, although they may seem somewhat rushed, are highly recommended. Most tours are conducted in Hungarian (naturally) with at least one or more daily tours in English, French, Italian and Russian, and in a few other languages at least once weekly. Tour schedules can be found online and it's best to try to reserve tickets at the rather dingy-looking booking office a day or two earlier (if possible) as it's not unknown for tours to be cancelled with no reasons provided. Tour groups assemble outside the building at designated spots facing grassy Lajos Kossuth Square. There's a security check prior to entering the Parliament Building but once inside, check out the sets of grand stairs that lead up to the main landing. Tour routes may vary but highlights should include the central domed hall, the royal symbols of Hungary (Crown of St Stephen, sword, sceptre, and globe), the Chamber of Deputies, and the Reading Room. In a throwback to the old days, look out for the simple but elegant numbered cigrarette/cigar holders outside the Chamber of Deputies."

It is cheaper to visit if you come from an EU country!"

We bought our tickets as part of a 'Grand tour' from Gray Line: http://www.grayline.com/tours/budapest/grand-city-tour-with-parliament-visit-5962_2/ (other tours may offer the same), so we walked straight in.There are 5 miles of corridors, 691 rooms and 26 staircase (give or take). But the tour covered very little really. We walked up a highly decorated staircase, along highly decorated corridors to see the main staircase (see photo). Then into the dome room (NO photos) to see the crown (anti-climax) guarded by two diagonally opposite guards with bayonets drawn. They change places every 15 minutes which is a bit of fun.We viewed one of (or the) chamber then out through the servants staircase.I don't think you can 'do it yourself' with an audio guide which is a pity. So I must admit I was a little disappointed."

You can take photos throughout except of the Holy Crown, where two soldiers with swords, looked quite scary and best not to get to close to them as they do a turn every so often.

You can buy the tickets online to save time and chose from different languages available, so if you are a poliglot, there are more chances that you find a free spot for a tour. I booked one day prior to my visit and got a place in the German tour, I suppose the English tour is aalways overbooked so try other languages. :D Price for EU-Students: 1200 Forint, which is about 4 Euro.

Entry was 2,000 HUF which is about \u00a35 provided you have an EU identity like a driving licence or passport otherwise the cost is 2 or 3 times higher. Possibly a bit boring for kids though. If like me you have to kill 2 hours then walk along the Danube and cross the first bridge, walk along the other side and cross the next bridge and complete the loop.

The interior is something that should not be missed when visiting Budapest. The architecture is magnificent and awe inspiring with every corner you turn. We were there the day before the NATO Conference so it was very interesting to see it set up for that purpose as well. We thoroughly enjoyed our tour and would certainly go back again."

Interesting that Hungary, presently with about 10 million people, and even in the late 19th century with a population that was much smaller than many other countries, built such a magnificent structure to house its Parliament. The building also houses the Hungarian Crown, which some natives regard with reverence. On the down side, security is tight and the tour felt rushed by the security guards. There were too many tourists in our group, which meant that I couldn't hear the guide most of the time."

There are several monuments (Imre Nagy Bridge, Ronald Reagan Statue) around the building that are worth seeing as well.There is an option to take a tour inside the parliament building. For this, you need to go to the left side of the building (if your back is to the Danube) and walk down the stairs that lead underneath the building. While it is a very expensive tour, I will still recommend it for history buffs or those who enjoy historic government buildings."

We were attracted by this architectural beauty since our first day in Budapest when we were just randomly cruising around. It is a large building complex right next to the Danube River. It has various different langue guided tours at different time slots. However English is the most popular ones and it's always filled quickly. We got there before 11 am and were lucky to get the 5:15 pm guided tour. In the mean time, we visited the museum located on the ground floor. It is free admission if you got the guided tour ticket. It is a small museum and we finished within 30 mins. There are quite a bit of interactive activities but mostly in Hungarian. The staffs in the museum are very friendly. Although we have language barrier, they tried very hard to explain how to use or the history of those activities. We really appreciated it. For the actual parliament guided tour, as there were a lot of other tourists for the same tour, even though we were 10 mins late, we were still able to catch the end tail to go through the security desk. As soon as we got through the security, we were told that we needed to climb over 160 stair steps to the starting point of the tour. For those who have difficulties to use the staircase, it does have elevator but you need to tell them separately. Unfortunately my husband didn't feel well half way up and we decided to leave the tour to catch some fresh air. After a small break, he felt better and therefore we tried to explain our situation to its ticket office, and hoping for rescheduled for another tour or plain refund. Without much effort, the lady immediately offer the next available tour (it's in Spanish since the English one is completely over booked). They are definitely tried to be as friendly and flexible as they possibly can be. Overall, it's a very pleasant experience."

I wasn't able to join an English speaking tour during the time I was there (all sold out). Instead I joined a Spanish tour and that was interesting. The building is beautiful and worth seeing, the attention to detail is something to behold."

I believe it was the most expensive structure in the world to build at the time. Every inch of the interior had been masterfully constructed. We were surprised though at how small the actual space was where Parliament sits. Not recommended for anyone with mobility issues. Don't think we saw an elevator one."

This is a great one. We got an English language tour. It takes less than two hours. The building is spectacular and you get to see the crown of St. Stephen which has been the symbol of Hungarian nationhood since 1000 A.D. The wide use of gold leaf, the parliamentary chambers, statues and friezes are memorable. I guarantee you will be glad you took the tour. If you take a night river cruise, your enjoyment will be magnified by knowing what the Parliament looks like inside and out."

The Parliament is a worldwide unique building. ...and now that its main square and its surroundings have been completely re-designed and refurbished it brings its old glory onto a new level in my opinion. You can only see a part of the Parliament when you visit it (certainly) as it still operates accordingly to its function. However even with the short stroll you are allowed to make in it you definatelly understand its magnificiance. The marble they used, the 1000 year old crown you can see, etc.. It is \"young-old\" enough to do not expect something jaw dropping. However visiting it and have a nice walk around is definately a MUST. It is also in walking distance from many sights and here you could have a rest as well if the weather is nice (at the square or at the Danube or at the nearby Olimpia park.Oh, if you can, check out the daily flag taking up/down ceremony. I liked it (it is a new thing if I am not mistaken)."

The inside of the Parliament House in Budapest is indeed beautiful, however the tours are very expensive and absolutely disorganised from the moment one arrives. We had pre-booked our timed tickets before leaving Australia. On arrival there is no sign to say which time slot is entering the security area, so there were people almost missing their tour as they were lined up behind people waiting for later tours. Confusion reigned whilst they scanned tickets as numbers for group tours did not tally. Once through the security gates a long speech was delivered in Hungarian, despite the fact we were on the time slot for an English speaking tour. We were rushed by our guide from feature to feature and it was very difficult to stay in the right group as different groups criss-crossed over each other. At one stage two tour guides had a \"demarkation dispute\" , as our tours ended up in the same area at the same time. My husband described the tour guide as a \"jack rabbit\" as if one didn't keep an eye on her she would \"jack rabbit off \". I was trying to take photos , and would indeed have been left behind on many occasions if not for my husband. We wondered afterwards if there were some poor souls left wandering around lost in the many rooms of the Parliament House. The inside of Parliament House is indeed beautiful, but the tours need to be lengthened and organised a lot better before I would recommend them. They were our most expensive tour on our trip and certainly delivered a lot less due to poor organisation. Smaller , less groups & far better organisation is required to justify the cost."

After two weeks on the river cruise from Amsterdam to Budapest we had seen an enormous amount of gothic revival architecture so walking around the grounds of the magnificent Budapest parliament building was another rewarding afternoon as it has been completely refurbished and is gleaming as if it had just been completed. Would have liked to see the interior as it looks impressive in the guide but for European Union residents the entry price is $10 but for non E.U. citizens it is $25+. I'm sorry Budapest but I know a rip off when I see one. Not very welcoming."

It's actually 3 buildings designed by 3 different architects. There are several very interesting statues around it as well that are worth seeing. Take the time to at least get a close up view of this amazing structure."

It is a very disorganized mess, the keepers had no idea of what to do, and took orders from a very agitated person, who seemed rather disoriented as well. With people breaking into the lines, the heat is unbearable, so was the stench from the sweaty crowds. We were told that most of the time it is like that, a total circus. Guides from different groups kept yelling, and some of us who were on our own, were kept waiting at the side, without being told why. So, instead of the grand tour, we decided to only visit the newly opened \"museum\", which is more like a show-and-tell about Hungary's royalty, priests and the military. We might return in a couple of years, and hopefully by then, this royal mess will no longer be. Only then shall we visit the Parliament."

In Budapest it's the highest and largest building with 691 rooms. Next to the Danube River and to Lajos Kossuth Square. In Gothic Revival style, it has 2 parliament halls, one for the politics and one for the guided tours. Since 2000 it houses the original Hungarian regalia, a copy of which you may see at the ecclesiastical museum of Matthias Church. The visited area inside the Parliament is limited and no photos are allowed in certain halls. There is a security check at the entrance, similar to the airport one and you must have a document to cofirm your name and your nationality. There are no restrooms and lockers. To get inside you must have a timed ticket with the language you have chosen to find the right group. Tickets can be bought on-line (recommended) because at the spot, the queuing is always very long in front of the visitor centre at the north side of the building. You must check also when the Parliament is open to the public. Prices are: For European citizens \u20ac 15.- for adults, for non-European citizens \u20ac 30.- But even from the outside, the building is so impressive. When illuminated during the night, it's part of the special panorama of Budapest, if not the central piece of it."

From here we toured the sights as a small group in a mini-bus with an excellent (if rather full!) commentary provided on the histiry of the city.The history of Hungary was reinforced once we started the guided tour of the interior of the Parliament and the original settlers' migration from Asia now reflected in the colourful local adaptation of its Gothic Revival style - based on the UK Houses of Parliament.The golden staircase is quite spectacular and visitors also get to see the Hungarian Crown Jewels - not as spectacular as the British Crown Jewels but steeped in important histoiry nonetheless."

However, for non EU members, it is expensive for such a short tour...barely 35 minutes long by the time we all got through the security check. Considering we had a 3.5 hour walking tour for almost the same price a different day, I think we could have just looked at the outside and saved ourselves the $50 Canadian dollars. Also, as tourists, we can order our tickets online, for an extra fee...but then we can't show the ticket on our iPad...we had to figure out where a copy shop was to log into our email andprint. That seems a little crazy to us in this day of technology. When arriving, there are FREE bathrooms...that is seldom found in Europe so we were happy about that. The lineup to get in is disorganized as no one knows how it works except the staff who don't seem to help much. Basically, don't crowd around the entry point...a guide will call your tour time and language when they are ready for us, we got called at 11:59 for the 12:00 tour. THEN, you can all push on tougher instead of lining up? Frustrating. The othe thing that was irritating was the the sound system the guide used was really static sounding so it was really difficult to hear what she was saying, Your tour ticket includes the basic museum (not a lot of English and NO pictures allowed). However, you have to ask for the free tickets...another line up and then re-enter the security check AGAIN so more lining up. Wow...there are so easy fixes here that would make it a lot more pleasant of an experience."

The Buda may have height and the dramatic skyline of Castle Hill, but the building that most characterises the power and gravity of the city is this monumental parliament building, over on the Pest- side of the river. Of-course, it comes with the obligatory raft of statistics..... 17 years in building.... 691 rooms.... 40 million bricks and a workforce of a thousand men. Thinking about its size, my femme quipped that for Ceausescu this would have been a kitchen extension , however in 1902 it was the largest parliament in the world. Outside the frontage, a huge, rather disdainful bronze lion reclines below the twin flags of Hungary and the Euro Union, both hanging limp and lifeless on this torpid morning. Inside, we find ourselves on a wide, red-carpeted staircase with stained-glass windows and gilded columns rising high on either side. One can definitely not deny the presence of the place. The red carpet leads inexorably up into a high- domed central hall and another iconic national image encased in an impregnable glas case on a marble plinth, set directly below the highest point of the 300-foot dome, guarded by three soldiers with drawn swords. They protect the 1000 year old crown of Istvan I, father of the nation. We were taken by the extravagance of the Chamber of Representatives, not unlike a grand opera house. We walk out onto the gleaming limestone terrace overlooking the Duna. The ramparts of Castle Hill rise up across the river, a hazy skyline of walls and roofs tiled in red and gold. This is a grand city.... and spectacular in every way."

The tour itself is fascinating and leaves you wanting more. I seem to recall the tour guide saying we had seen only about two percent of the building inside. It was mind-blowing as we walked around there, up and down corridors and stairs and into rooms and chambers, to think what a tiny fraction of this really impressive building we had seen.

She really is a fabulous looking building with all manner of spires and domes, sticking out in all directions.

The intricate exterior is perfectly complemented by the ornate interior and really must not be missed when visiting Budapest.Entry to the Parliament building is by guided tour only, and this was the only disappointing thing about the whole visit. It lasts for 45 minutes and really doesn't provide any useful or interesting information. However the beauty of the building more than makes up for it. Guided tours can be booked for the same day, but should be booked in advance. We went on a Friday morning (arrived at 10am) and the next available English tour was at 12."

There is a tour you can take inside but we did not have time. Also we had been advised to pre-book. A MUST is the underground museum of the tragic events of 25 October 1956. When you re-emerge into the beautiful surroundings it is almost impossible to believe what happened there barely 60 years ago. Along the front of the parliament building, on the edge of the Danube itself, is a haunting memorial of another terrible time in this beautiful city's history in the form of sculpted shoes of all shapes and sizes. This is to honour the Jews who, during World War II, were ordered to take off their shoes, and were shot at the edge of the water so that their bodies fell into the river and were carried away."

Tickets were 2000 Forints.There's a security check before you go in and then a hundred odd steps to climb to the start of the tour- although there is a lift if stair climbing is a problem. The Grand Staircase , Congress Hall and Lobbies are impressive but the Crown Jewels in the vast space of the Domed Hall is spectacular. The two guards on duty have drawn sabres, and no photography is allowed under the Dome- the Security personnel accompanying each tour will make sure cameras aren't used , and they're very firm with anyone who looks like they're ignoring the no pictures request. In any other part of the building they don't mind how many photos you take! The scale model of the Parliament at the end of the tour is a fantastic piece of work- even down to a the scale models of the state regalia and St Stephen's crown- and there are some really good photos of the development and restoration of the Parliament building. The tour's the only way you'll get to see inside such an iconic neo-Gothic building , but I suspect you might get more info about the building by reading an informative guidebook rather than relying just on the tour guide."

The building is stunning, crafted from limestone and sporting lots of towers. If you time it right, in the square the guards will come out and do a marching 'dance' routine. With swords. I don't know how often this happens; we happened to stumble upon it just as it was about to begin. The head guard then let onlookers take photographs with them. Pop around the side to the visitor centre and you have 2 options: a guided tour for about 40 mins (costs about 2000ft if memory serves me correctly) or PPP into the museum for free. We didn't manage to get onto a tour. The English speaking tours sell our very quickly so it's best to buy tickets in advance. We were there at about 1:30, 2:00pm and the next one with spaces wasn't until 6.So we decided to go to the museum. You need to get a free ticket from the desk (this isn't made clear). You can't go straight through; you need to hang around at the security turnstile and when there is a gap between the tour groups, they let you go through. This took 4 attempts and we almost gave up. You then go through airport style security and through to the museum. There are a few signs in 3 or 4 languages to tell you what some of the artefacts are. Otherwise, you're on your own to work things out. The toilets are decent and free, and they are outside the entrance, so they are a top tip if you need to go as public toilets in the city are elusive. Overall, stunning building, would like to have gone on a tour but it was pretty chaotic inside."

Your tour guide will then come out and rally everyone. You then have to go through the security similar to that at an airport. Then you get taken on the tour.I was very interesting seeing the gold leaf absolutely everywhere. The main entrance is incredible. You see the crown as well. They strictly enforce the no photo rule at this part of the tour.

Personally feel that ticket entry is too much for it. And they say.. It's made out of 40kilos of gold.. But in India many temples hold more than 100 kilos of gold. Apart from that it's nice to see a parliment and get it's feel but nothing out of the world or extraordinary."

It's about US$20 per person for non EU traveller, and we booked it online ahead of time.The building of parlament is magnificent and I was really excited for the tour. We came to the meeting point, which is located at visitor's centre, a few minutes before the start of the tour. It's not very easy to find it, because the are no signs, but we found it to the right of the parlament building if you face the main entrance.The lobby was packed with people, and it was pretty chaotic. We were told to wait for the guide outside of security check point. After we were waiting for a while, a guide for the German tour group said to go inside security line and wait for the guide there. English speaking guide was running late.Once she showed up she took us to the main floor. The whole tour took no more than 20 minutes. It felt pretty rushed, not very informative and a complete waste of money.The building looks very impressive inside, but absolutely not worth paying for the tour.The tour guide told us that you can also go for a free Parlament Museum inside the same building, but to go there you have to walk outside and re-enter security point(after waiting again in the long line). We didn't want to wait and left, so I can't comment if you can see the building inside just by going to the museum for free instead of paying for the useless tour."

Good to see the parliament building during this tour, but a few niggles....First of all, there is a lack of information on arrival, so it's not clear where to wait if you have already bought tickets (as we had). We saw a queue for security and joined it for 10 minutes, only to discover as we reached the front, that this was for the visit before ours. One lady eventually came to the front and talked (without microphone) over the noise of the crowd to let us know what to do....we couldn't hear any of this, but word spread through the crowd and we understood that it was now our turn to go through security. Once through this, the tour got in place. The main problem with the visit was that there are several tours taking place at the same time, so there is constant background noise of other language tours taking place - the acoustics of the high-ceilinged rooms makes it really hard to focus on your own guide's words."

Not only is the outside pretty breathtaking, the inside is absolutely gorgeous as well. There's a lot of history in the building, and it happened to be a special day so we were able to visit some areas that aren't normally part of the tour. The tour guide was great and easy to understand. As a student, I thought the price was worth it, but I got to pay the student price. Can't say I would have paid if I had to pay the regular adult fee."

It is a nice opportunity to see a beautiful historical building so it's hard not to recommend it.That said, you have to be prepared for the lead up to the tour. The place is a complete disaster. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance, which we did. You pick the language of interest and the specific time slot. You print your ticket and show up. Then what? Good question. The place is complete chaos. No one tells you where to wait or what to wait for. At the exact time of your tour (if you are lucky) someone using a rather weak microphone will welcome you and will tell you tedious details about security. Then you will proceed through security with members of your group. This will take about 20 minutes. There are no seats to sit inside as you wait for others to join you. You can leave your coat and bags at bag check after you go through security.The tour then follows. It's rather short, but the guide does share some interesting pieces of information. And you do get to see some of the most important areas of the building. They allow flash photography almost everywhere. What I cannot wrap my head around is why they do not allow photography, say, without flash, in the main dome area with the crown. It is one of the most beautiful architectural elements and you cannot take a picture. There aren't really opportunities for questions although if you ask one, hopefully you'll get an answer. I cannot give the tour five stars as the organization is completely lacking and chaotic. But generally speaking, it is a nice experience so if you plan it ahead of time and go in with the above knowledge, hopefully it won't be frustrating."

One complaint is that there is lots of disorganization when it comes to getting through security to start the tour. Nevertheless, our tour started on time and we had no problems. The tour lasts about 40 minutes and you can take pictures inside. Our guide was very insightful, but with had sense of humor (something that is always appreciated with these types of tours). Highlights include the Hungarian crown heels and their guards, the parliamentary chamber, and the documentary photograph of the restoration. We also happened to see the performance of the parliament guards outside of the building (not part of the tour) although it's not clear when or how often they do this, it was pretty neat to watch. There is also an underground memorial to the 1958 massacre. This is free and worth stoping in."

We saw it during the daytime (took an escorted tour of the interior) and it was well worth the price. The building inside and out is stunning. We also saw it lit up from the Danube Promenade and also on Danube Boat Cruise at night. Took many jaw dropping pictures. Paris is the \"City of Lights\" but Budapest (along the Danube Promenade) easily rivals that other great city. If you visit Budapest and neglect to take the tour of this stunning architectural achievement (or at the very least the boat cruise at night to see Budapest lit up) then you are truly not seeing Budapest at its best."

The cost is very reasonable- 2000 HUF for an adult with an EU passport (around a fiver) and for a student it costs half of this. The facts told by our tourguide were very interesting and there were plenty of opportunities to capture some beautiful photos; the building inside is as spectacular on the inside as it is on the outside. The highlight was getting to see the 1000 year old crown and it was followed by a rather amusing show of the guards marching round it. The only thing I would recommend to do is book in advance as the tours can sell out very quick."

After WW 2 the Russians refused to go home, and in 1956 Hungarians fought their hardest to 'encourage' them. The Red Star placed above this Parliament was not removed until 1990The entrance is just magic. The staircase, red carpet and the ceiling, are just beautiful!!Hungarians have a wonderful sense of color, usually based on red and gold.Similarly, the chamber and dome are color co-ordinated and very attractive.

We got to see the original royal crown (no photography allowed), which is heavily guarded by 4 guardsmen in the centre of the building. The place isn't lavish, but is smothered in Gold leaf and the grand staircase just makes you say WOW! What made this tour for me was the house of parliament itself (the round room, its history and coat of arms - photography allowed).I like this tour purely because not many parliaments around the world open their doors for an insight like this one.

The English tour guide was well prepared and she answered nicely to all questions.In regards to the rooms, the entry and the mail hallway are charming while the parliament room is not as large as in other countries because there are only 199 parliament members. The building is symmetrical and has two identical parliament halls out of which one is used for the politics, the other one is used for guided tours. You actually visit only half of the Parliament, but you don't actually losing anything as the other half is identical.Overall it is a very beautiful building with an amazing architecture. If you are in a hurry I don't think you are missing a lot if you don't go inside, but you should definitely admire it at least from outside.The fee was around 7 euro for EU members (you will need to show and ID) and less (I think half) for kids/students.

They've moved some statues and put new ones in. They've paved most of the park giving everything a more open feeling. On our latest trip we passed here most days and it was really nice to get a good view of Parliament"

I only managed this with help however i now know if you get to the Parliament ticket office early enough they will print this for you. The tour is a bargain for EU citizens. Incidentally I brought my passport but was not asked for it.The second issue was the guards' officious manner. Both at the beginning and end of the tour they were rude and unfriendly.

According to the Viator website I was entitled to cancel within 7 calender days of having ordered the tour. I filled in the appropriate form for a cancellation only to be told that Viator refused to refund my money but would cancel my booking. According to their terms I forfeited the entire cost of the tour but had I purchased their travel insurance I would have been covered. As I live in Sweden and had made the booking on a Swedish website Swedish Consumer Protection laws allow me to cancel all internet purchases within 14 days. Quite honestly this feels like a scam and Viator is apparently a subsidiary of Trip Advisor. This is not a good way to run a business and attract future (unsupecting) travellers."

It is a bit tricky to find where to go because it is rather hidden on the back side of this building. Look for a very modern looking visitor center and go downstairs. If you have your ticket printed just wait until your time and correct language tour. People with coats may check them at a coat check. All people need to go through security. There are 130 stairs to climb before the tour actually starts. There is the option of using an elevator. The cost is 5,200ft and 2,600 Ft for students.A person may take pictures except in the room under the dome where the crown is located. This crown is not very ornate and the cross at the top is bent to one side. The crown may have been sent to St Istvan in the year 1,000. In the meantime, the crown has been stolen, misplaced and lost. Between WWII and 1978 the crown was at Fort Knox until President Carter had it returned to Hungary.The interior is decorated with 84 pounds of gold. The building was constructed between 1885 to 1902. There is a changing of the guard outside every hour. At the end of the short ceremony, a person may take a picture with them.The tour was supposed to last 45 minutes but by the time everyone goes through security, climbs the 130 steps, the tour is about 30 minutes."

The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and the focus seemed to be primarily on the history and architecture of the building which appealed to me. However, she did speak a little quietly and briskly which was a little problematic as the group size was around 50 on the last English tour of the day. My highlight was the guards change of position inside the dome, well worth a view. The photo exhibit in the basement focused on the recent renovations was not very interesting, particularly as the English translations were not easily available but you can always zoom through this bit if it's not your cup of tea."

To enter it you have to go to the visitors centre which is round the other side of the building and down some stairs. We bought our tickets on line, was easy to do, as the tours get booked up. There are different languages at different time slots. The tour is only 1 hour and consists of a walk down a corridor to the main grand entrance, a look at the crown and then into a conference room and then one of the rooms where the nitty gritty stuff takes place. Would have liked to have seen more , especially the library. We did the 9.45am tour and saw the changing of the guards where the crown is kept. You can take photos but not of the crown. There is also a caf\u00e9 in the visitors centre part, and toilets but you have to pay."

The whole group was very angry as there was no explanation, and we had walked up over 100 steps to see two rooms and that was it! The small part of tour we did get was poor quality anyway, and we could hardly hear the guide. You were also not allowed to take photos of the crown - the only good bit of the tour! :(We actually spent more time going through security than on the tour itself. What a joke!! Most of the group went to complain and were ignored by the staff who practically hid on the other side of the room behind their counter, trying to pretend we were not there. It was like they hoped we would all give up and go away if they ignored us long enough. They kept telling us they had called a senior manager who would sort the situation in 5 minutes.... It took OVER 1 HOUR until we were eventually refunded 50% of our ticket price. And still no apology! It was all very disrespectful, and they should treat their tourists much better.The worst part of this disaster was not the waste of money but the waste of time. When you only have a limited time in a city, you want to make the most of it, and if we had known what a shambles this place was, we would have gone elsewhere!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! Even without our problems, the full tour is only of three rooms, and you won't hear or learn much at all. Security takes ages and staff are uninterested. Just take some nice photos outside."

By any stretch of the imagination this is a spectacular building but I wish that our tour had been a lot more informative about its creation and how it functions rather than have a guide who basically re-iterated what I could read in a guide book. As an EU citizen the charge for me was 2,000 HUF and not free like some guide books would have it. Given the brevity of the tour - 40 minutes tops - I would say that the value-for-money was a bit on the low side. There can be no doubt that the interior is opulent - gold leaf and marble everywhere - and the statues of the important kings and queens of Hungary's turbulent history are here in abundance but it could do with more information boards around to get a better sense of what made Hungary the nation it is today. Sadly, there is very little to reflect Hungary's history in the second half of the 20th century but I did visit during the week of Vladimir Putin's trip to Budapest so maybe anything to do with that era was purposely put under wraps.I could not get away from the feeling that the Hungarian Tourist Board have cottoned on to the fact that people want to visit the country's seat of power but they want to control this desire in order to financially benefit from it - no one could deny that the Visitor Centre looks brand-spanking new and is geared up to parting tourists from their money. It could explain why the tours are hurried and tightly controlled - you could not wander off exploring without causing a security incident !!!If there was one thing that did stand out for me it came at the end of the tour, when our guide left us in a room that showed photos of the restoration work done to the building to bring it up to its current stunning condition. These were fascinating, although again I could have done with some accompanying text to describe what was going on in the photos.So I would not make a particular beeline for this building unless it was my last day in town and I wanted to get rid of 2,000 HUF in change that I had collected. There are too many alternatives that are more worth your time, effort and money."

Just book your tickets at the visitor\u2019s reception area which is at the northern end of the building.Inside the building itself is beautiful, you get a chance to see the crown jewels, however you are unable to take photos of them. You also visit the debating chamber& a museum at the end showing photos of construction& renovation through the years. You finish the tour in a souvenir store.Overall a great visit to a must see attraction whilst in Budapest!"

After visiting there I can imagine that they charge so much in hopes someday to cover for the building expenses. You can enter the building only with a tour guide they provide, and they have tours in different languages (if you decide to go check first the time of each tour). We took the tour in Russian (just because the English tour was starting 45 minutes after). The guide was a really nice old man who tried to be funny. The information provided in this tour wasn't something you couldn't read in a book, and basically you see to corridors, the main stairs (but you are not allowed to walk on), the hall where the \"real\" crown is being guarded and you are not allowed to take pictures, and the main hall where the Parliament takes place.If you have free time (approximately an hour) and you don't care about the entrance fee then go there and you will see the most beautiful Parliament in the whole world (based on our guides words)."

Once we tried & the ticket office was closed due to broken equipment. Another time we tried the tours were canceled due to the presence of a visiting dignitary. We finally tried again when a friend was visiting us in B'pest & finally succeeded. Don't remember what we paid, but it was not a bargain. Although the building is quite sizable, the tour only covers a small section of the building. And one cannot take photos in the rotunda. Why? Because there, guarded by numerous soldiers is a REPLICA of the crown of Hungary. The actual crown is in a vault somewhere. From there we went to the hall where the legislators take their breaks & finally into the parliamentary chambers. All in all, the building was beautiful, but the tour was rather lame &, as is often the case in Hungary, the version of history that the guides give the tourists is not accurate in its portrayal of the roles various countries/governments have played in Hungary's history."

It's a gorgeous and very ornate building.Be sure to view it at nighttime from the Buda side across the river. It's stunning after dark when it's lit up with lights.

This building is the pride and joy of not only the residents of Budapest, but also everyone who shares in the wonder of this magnificent piece of architecture. The best views are from the Buda side of the Danube and it looks stunning at night time. Even if buildings and landmarks are not your first priority when visiting cities, you must make sure that you at least view this attraction as you will take away your own personal memory of true magnificence."

This is apparently the third largest Parliament building in the world and is magnificent no matter which view you choose from the outside. The tour will take you around an hour to complete and you'll get a good flavor for the historic and contemporary Government. Personally, I really liked the old cigar holders reserved for each member. They rested their cigars here whilst voting and before returning to re-light and get on with the real business of running Hungary"

I visited the British Parliament and I must say that the Hungarian one is the most beautiful Parliament I have ever seen (queen Elizabeth said it was the second one, I don't agree). It is the third biggest Parliament in the world (after Britain and Argentina). After the Second World War the Hungarians reconstructed as much as they could and it is AMAZING. I tried to visit it in Summer but there was a huge list of people waiting so I wasn't able (if you go in peak season it is mandatory to book in advance). In winter there is much less people waiting to see this monument, but be careful and book your tickets anyway! There are tours in many languages and in the inside you can see the crown with which all the kings were crowned (since St. Stephan). Don't miss the Parliament, it is amazing."

The Crown Jewels are not as impressive as others but do have an interesting background. It is also amusing to watch the guards go through their motions (if your tour is lucky enough to be there at the time).A must do in Budapest.Hint: there is a WC inside the visitors area but the cafe does charge - go outside and use the one there - its just as good and free (what a wonderful difference that is for we who come from a country that does not charge for toilets)"

Read all of the notes and tips on the ticketing website, so you don\u2019t break any rules. Tours are given in multiple languages at different times during the day. The Tourist Center (entrance) can be reached on either side of the Parliament (front/back). It is at the Margaret Island end of the building. Take some extra time and walk all the way around the building and marvel at the details. The interior is even more opulent, if you can imagine! This is a working Gov\u2019t building and it treated as such, ie: armed guards and tight security. Guards are with the group at all times, and stragglers are prohibited. In approved locations, get your pictures taken quickly, because if you are in the back & can\u2019t see, once the Guide moves on to the next room, the Guard won\u2019t allow you to move forward to get your shot. When you go into the Crown Room, and they tell you \u201cno photography\u201d they mean it. There was a gentleman that must have thought using his cell phone camera didn\u2019t count \u2013 and he was quickly grabbed by the arm and escorted from the room. He was never brought back to the group, so I don\u2019t have any idea what happened to him! Something that was not listed on any review or any website, that we would have found helpful, was that as soon as you pass thru security for the tour, you have to climb 96 stairs! All\u2026 at\u2026 once! My 75 year old mother almost didn\u2019t make it. It was flight after flight of stairs, and with the Guard on your tail, there was no time to stop and catch your breath.

On a very cold Sunday in February we were disappointed we had left a visit to the Parliament until the last day of our holiday since the area was deserted, all the doors shut up and only a few security guards to be seen; it\u2019s closed on a Sunday we thought. However don\u2019t be fooled! Keep walking round to the north side of the building and the visitor entrance can be found, not actually on the building as such but down some stairs into a modern constructed area which feels underground, complete with a cafe area, gift shop and free toilets. It isn\u2019t brilliantly signposted so make sure you keep looking!You can only get inside the Parliament building as part of a guided tour which can be booked at the desk in the visitor area. These are organised by language and times displayed on the large display. We arrived around 2pm and the next (and only) English tour was at 3pm. Last tour on a Sunday looked to be around half four. It\u2019s useful that they display the remaining places on each tour on the screen too. Prices were very reasonable really; 4,000HUF for an adult ticket. However if you are an EU citizen you get half price. They will ask you for some ID to prove this so tuck your driving license or passport in your pocket before you go.Our tour guide was perfectly fluent in English and could be easily heard across the group of around 35 people on the tour. We gathered at the electronic barriers and proceeded through security were bags are searched and bodies x-rayed. There is a free cloakroom here to save lugging too much around.The tour lasts about 30 minutes and begins by climbing around 100 small stairs to the main floor (there is a lift available if required). It was nice that photos were allowed in all but one area and the pace was good enough to be able to occasionally stop and look at some of the more non-obvious features. A great description was given of the grand staircase and then the decorations around the jewels and crown (the area where photos are prohibited). The only criticism I would have of the tour was that with the size of the group it was a little harder to fully admire the views inside the commons area; this is because fitting all thirty or so people into the two press viewing areas resulted in a scrabble to the front etc.For the price this is definitely worth a visit. Get there early in the summer or pre-book as only a limited number of people are allowed, especially if you do want a specific language tour. The interior of the building is even more grand and impressive than the outside and we learnt a lot of interesting facts and history about Budapest in general form the great tour guide."

Its not long at all, and very interesting. They take you through one side of the parliment that is not in use, but identical to the \"active side.\" Theres a lot of interesting anecdotes and history surrounding the building and the crown jewels are spectacular. The architecture on the inside is just as beautiful as the outside."

The second day we found it after walking round the building properly, but heard a couple asking some locals where it was. Need better signposts!When we went inside we were shocked as to how cheap it was so decided to go ahead. It was around \u00a33/\u00a34 The woman then told us the next English tour wasn't for another 3 hours. I explained we didn't want a tour and just wanted to look around, we weren't interested in the history etc but no, apparently this isn't allowed?! Then on the board I saw another 2 times before the one she had said for an English tour and it was saying spaces still available! We can't be the only ones to have walked out. Not everyone wants a guided tour. But apart from this, worth the visit for the exterior views."

Luckily there's a considerable discount for EU citizens (half the price) and even more considerable for EU students (1 4th the price!).To sum up: I'd recommend the tour only if you have time left, but it's not mandatory."

Surely one of the Budapest must-see attractions, located on the Pest side bank overlooking the river Danube, just in front of the Fisherman Bastion, on Buda hill, ideal location for a wonderful Parliament panoramic photo.The Budapest Parliament has been built, starting from 1873, based on design of Magyar architect Imre Steindl, according to Neo-Gothic style (it can be easily recognized from the large amount of pinnacles, scattered on its full covering extension); nevertheless, even further styles can be found, like Neo-Renaissance of the dome.The building shows two exactly identical wings, symmetrical in respect of the central dome; one of such wings is dedicated to tourists\u2019 visits, while the other one is utilized by the politics (and prohibited to the public).A very huge amount of bricks (millions), precious stones (hundred thousands), and even something like 40 kg of gold have been utilized for its construction, which involved almost thousand people; that resulted in a building that, even today, seems to be the tallest and biggest in Budapest.The Parliament can be visited exclusively through a guided group tour, that is arranged daily, at different hours between 8 am and 4 pm during winter season; I strongly recommend to buy the ticket on-line quite in advance (on web site www.jegymester.hu), to avoid long queue and even tickets sold-out.The guided tour is arranged in several languages (relevant tickets sale is properly diversified on above mentioned web site); the ticket fare is 2000 Ft per EU adult (about 6.50 Euro, plus 200 Ft for on-line purchase).Any visit is starting at the underground visitor center, where different nationalities are gathered; at the visit time, any person has to go through a scanner, for security check, and the group will be picked-up by a guide and a guard.Once left the visitor center, we entered in a gold-plated staircase, taking to the main floor of the Parliament; along the way, richly decorated corridors, statues on the walls, stained glass windows looking at Kossuth square, wonderful ceiling frescos.After that, we arrived at the Old Upper House Hall, presently dedicated to conferences; there, we\u2019ve been delighted by the oak panels and paintings adorning the wall behind the podium, the lovely gold-plated decorations, the tables and seats. Several galleries are located at different floors, allowing the people to follow the Upper House\u2019s meetings in the past.Continuing our visit, after passing through the Upper House Lobby, we\u2019ve been introduced to the Dome Hall, the only ambient where photos are strictly prohibited; it\u2019s really difficult to render the magnificence of such huge majestic hall, symbolic center of the Country. At the center of the hall, the Hungarian Holy Crown and other symbolic objects are protected, inside a glass case, by two Crown guards.Last step of the visit was the Grand Stairway, leading to the main entrance hall of the dome; its ceiling shows some frescos made by Karl Lotz, which masterpieces are even present at the Opera House and other important Budapest sites. Even there, the rich decorations left in our eyes a strong feeling of opulence\u2026My overall impression has been fantastic! Good organization, guide very skilled and speaking a very good Italian, time of the visit properly arranged, in such a way to calmly see anything, and consolidate the information got from the guide."

It was nice to see the interior of the stunning Hungarian parliament building, but we expected way more from the offered tour.Out guide was nice, but the group was too big (about 40+ persons) for her; in fact I felt sorry for her. She gave some general informations about the building and only a short overview on the Hungarian political system, but only half of the group could hear it because she didn't speak loud enough (I'm sure she knew that people in the back wouldn't hear her, but she made no effort to speak louder - on the one hand I can understand that she didn't want to ruin her voice, but nevertheless you can expect to get a real tour for your money).The tour itself leads you threw the corridors of the parliament and into 4 (!) of the 691 rooms. As said in the title, it's a nice building, but the tour itself was rather poor."

We booked for a 12pm English speaking tour and when we got there, only four English tickets remained for the whole day and even then not for 2.5 hours which would have put us off. Plus there's a queue of about 60 people between you and the ticket desk!When we got there, the visitor's centre hall was swamped with people queuing. We had a frustrating wait at the info desk to check we could queue for security as we already had tickets, complete with a group pushing in front of us without waiting and then being served!Once we got into the queue for security we were sure we'd missed our slot. We were held in that queue for a long time, eventually it started moving and it turned out most of the queue were people trying to push in ahead of their time slot. The couple in front of us had tickets for 2.30 (it was midday at the time), and luckily the woman at the gate refused to let them in despite their protests.You go through scanners and the. Get met by your guide. The slot is 45 mins but you get walked around for about half an hour. It starts with you climbing 130 steps. Not a big deal to many, but worth noting if you struggle. There is a lift, but it was only a purple of minutes.The building is beautiful, well worth the entrance fee, and the guide spoke perfect English and gave us lots of information about the building and the history of the place. The tour ended in the parliament chamber, which was really interesting.All in all a worthwhile visit, but just make sure you book tickets in advance and don't freak out at the chaos in the entrance hall!"

We visited this parliament building on Monday.2014.December.22, I believe it is NOT usually open on Mondays, but was probably open this particular Monday as it would be closed for Christmas.If you plan on visiting, try and buy tickets beforehand. There is a limited number of people per tour and it seems to get quite busy. We signed up for the English tour starting at 11:15 am. It costs 4,000 HUF / person. At the current exchange rate, that's almost $18 Canadian / person.* * The only entrance for visitors is through the visitor centre which, looking at the front of the building with the river behind it, is to the right and down the stairs. * * As we had gotten there early, we went outside and walked around the grounds and took photos. The architecture of the building and grounds are quite impressive and beautiful. According to information from our cruise guide, it is the 3rd largest parliamentary building in the world. How this is measured I don't know.At about 11:05 am, we re-entered the visitor centre and joined the crowd of visitors that had descended upon this attraction. We waited and waited for the security to start screening visitors.At 11:15 when the tour was suppose to start, security still hadn't started and we were wondering what was going on. Finally, 10 - 15 minutes later, the tour guide asked for our attention and told us to go through security and that we'd re-group on the other side past security. So now we're all crowding around to get in line with other people for other language tours to go through security and for whatever reasons, they didn't start earlier and there are no line-up guide ropes (like the ones at airports), so we're all bunching together slowly. All this feels very unprepared, inefficient and disorganized. Bad planning overall. Whoever in charge of overseeing these tours should be fired.After getting through security, the tour starts and the information was presented in an informative but very dull fashion. The tour guide must have been running late because it felt rushed.The interior is very beautiful and immense. At one point, we were taking photos of the room where parliamentary affairs are discussed when the security guard got impatient and simply started barking, \"Go, go, go!\" Great attitude.The tour was pretty short and for the price felt like a total waste of money. There was no discussion of the exterior or the significance of the statues outside. The best part of the tour had nothing to do with the tour guide but was a photo gallery of the construction of the building just prior to entering the souvenir shop. If you plan on going, read up on the building interior and exterior beforehand, I found myself tuning out the tour guide."

Cost was modest, and glad we bought our tickets on-line before leaving the USA. We booked the English speaking tour at 10am which was a good fit for our schedule as we had time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast, yet have time to move on to other things that day. We walked from Le Meridian which turned out to be close to 30 minutes because we had to walk the length of the building to get to the visitor's center on the North end of the building.I think I would have preferred to arrive a little earlier, and have a coffee in the little caf\u00e9 prior to the tour."

Various major European languages are catered for. There is a reasonably priced caf\u00e9 inside the modern underground entrance area.You will need to go through an airport like security at the start of the tour. The building is very opulent, but it turns out that all the marble and granite is fake. I couldn't tell. Apparently it is to save weight, as the real stuff would weigh 3 times more, putting too much strain on the foundations. While we were there, thousands of people were demonstrating outside against the government. It was relatively peaceful though, with lots of speeches.Definitely worth a visit if you have the time."

This symettical gothic palace is a marvel to behold though, the walkign tours are expensive and quite crowded and to be honest didnt do the general awe any favours, if i could have my memory again i would probably have just visited from the outside and left the grandeur of the decor in my imagination as once again the hungarian Magnolia was in full swing"

We were able to see the changing of the guard around the 1000 year old crown, the sword and scepter which is encased behind a glass display. Those national treasures were a treat to see since they played such an important role in the history of the country. Be prepared to be escorted by a guard through out the whole tour.

She did repeat what we had missed, but until near the end of the tour, we could barely hear what she was saying and then she appeared to turn up the volume on her microphone. A few people asked questions in response to her request to ask, but there were a few things she was unable to answer and made no attempt to assure that she could find out.

I suggest that you book the tour online the day before you want to visit and print the tickets out. There are many options for the language of the tour, so look carefully at the options. Purchasing the tickets online and printing them will add 200 HUF (about 75 cents) to the ticket price. But then you are guaranteed to get the tour time you want. Buying the tickets at the Visitor Center of the Parliament Building can be problematic as you might be disappointed about getting the tour time you want. You enter the Parliament Building Security Screening at the tour time selected, not before. The tour last about an hour and the guides are very knowledgeable. The design of the interior of the building is breathtaking, and as magnificent as the exterior. There is a very nice cafe and restrooms in the Visitor Center. If your tour is shortly after lunch time, the cafe is a good place to have lunch."

Cost 4,000 forints (about \u00a311) but half price if you are from EU and have photo evidence thereof. Need to book your timed ticket for language required and numbers are limited so best to do this earlier in the day.Tour takes just under an hour and includes sight of the crown jewels. Despite its gothic architectural influences (modelled loosely on UK Houses of Parliament) construction was between 1895 ish to 1904. Nevertheless quite a spectacular building and even more so when lit up at night and viewed from the River Danube.It is a must see on any visit to Budapest but don't expect too much from the tour"

The CROWN on display was used for the last 1,000 years or so for the coronation of (I believe) all the Kings of Hungary...

We arrived on October 23rd 2014 in a light mist of rain to stand for 2 hours with thousands of people just to go inside. October 23rd 1956 was the start of Hungary's quest for democracy. It failed but Hungarian's still celebrate this day and hold it in high esteem. Our wait was rewarded with a walk up the grand staircase and past the Holy Crown and scepter. We later found out that there are two identical halls, one for tourists and other for government. This building is not as old as others in the area but is massive in size. Finished in 1904 the main fa\u00e7ade overlooks the River Danube, but the official main entrance is from the square on the east side of the building. Inside and outside, there are altogether 242 sculptures on the walls."

Tickets were purchased online and printed off the day prior to our visit. There is a newly opened visitor center that has walk up tickets, a restroom, gift-shop, and cafe. We arrived a few minutes early and decided to have a coffee in the cafe while waiting. Our tour was scheduled for 2:00 PM and an announcement was made precisely on schedule and our tour then started. First is a security checkpoint that requires passage through a metal detector. This is very similar to what happens at the airport. The only exception was someone had a pocketknife and he was allowed to give it to security and claim it when leaving (he was given a numbered card that corresponded to a locker his knife was placed in). We were then required to walk through a corridor to get inside the Parliament building where the actual tour started. This required walking up several staircases (an elevator was available if needed) and meeting our English speaking guide. Once the tour started, the guide gave explanations regarding many of the rooms and decorations but was sometimes difficult to hear if not standing close due to other groups passing by. The inside of the Parliament was spectacular and well worth our visit. The highlight was viewing the Crown Jewels in the rotunda guarded by two well turned out soldiers complete with brandished swords! All too soon the tour ended and we were led into a room where exhibits showed the progression of the recent renovations."

We visited on a Saturday morning and waited approximately 45 minutes for tickets. The tours are done in various languages so the next tour may not be in the language that you want. Our timed tour was scheduled to begin over 2 hours later so we walked around the local neighbourhood to kill some time. We returned 15 minutes before our scheduled tour start time and people from the previous start time were still waiting to be let in. A bit chaotic. Once we were in (past bag checks and metal detectors), the tour was quite good but far too short in my opinion. This building has almost 700 rooms and we visited maybe 5 in 45 minutes. What we did see was spectacular. The architecture is stunning with lots of sculpture, long corridors and an extravagant main entrance. Once the tour is over, you are escorted out so there is no opportunity to linger to enjoy the beauty of this building."

Yes, the place looks amazing. Yes, it is very large. Yes, it has lots of golden decorations and many of the usual special European architectures. But we are here to hear the story! They should really reconsider the story telling part of the tour. Also, our tour guide skipped the most important parts (to our humble opinion) concerning the days of WWII and Arrow Cross regime. They literally ignore very important times in the history of Hungary and Europe.Two more tips for the organizers of the tour:1. Please give a few moments between one tour to another. We were right behind the Russian language tour and their tour really interfered with ours.2. Groups should be much smaller. We didn't even had the time to ask questions because so many hands were raised and time was very limited."

Laid down in 1871 and launched in 1872, the monitor saw active service in the First World War. In 1919, \u2019Lajta\u2019 and her sister ship, the \u2018Maros\u2019 took an active part in the so-called \u2018Monitor Revolt\u2019 which was one of the first anti-communist rebellions in the world. A military takeover was organized in Budapest against the communist dictatorship and naval support from the Danube was seen as crucial to its success. When the monitors appeared on the river, they hoisted the red-white-green national flag, instead of the Soviet red one. The people welcomed them, but the revolt was soon brutally suppressed by Hungarian communist forces. The monitor can be visited free of charge on guided tours which start every half hour from 10:00-16:00 Tuesday-Saturday."

The walk in front of the parliament on the Danube promenade is one of the most stunning in the city without any doubts.There is a tour you can also take of the building - you can buy it on the far side of the building - the ticket hall is on the basement floor just next to where the statue of liberty is. The Hungarian flag on the backside of the Parliament (if you are approaching from the Danube side) has guards standing in full attention - which is quite a sight as well.The parliament building's neo-gothic architecture is very impressive and one can't but be in awe of the place."

Stunning interior with elaborate gold leaf decoration. The crown jewels are very well guarded and you musn't take photos in this room. Interesting to hear some of the history of the building. After the tour we visited the new cafe for coffee which was very good. Stunning building from the outside and flood-lit at night. A must visit whilst in Budapest.

The Hungarian Parliament Building, also known as House of the Country or House of the Nation, is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary, one of Europe's oldest legislative buildings. It is a stunning example of Gothic Architecture. It is a notable landmark of Hungary and a popular tourist destination of Budapest. It lies in Lajos Kossuth Square, on the bank of the Danube. It is currently the largest building in Hungary and one of the tallest buildings in Budapest. The inside of the Parliament building is equally as impressive as the outside of the building. The parliament building is symmetrical and thus has two absolutely identical parliament halls out of which one is used for official politics, while the other hall is used for guided tours. It is 268 m (879 ft) long and 123 m (404 ft) wide. Its interior includes 10 courtyards, 13 passenger and freight elevators, 27 gates, 29 staircases and 691 rooms (including more than 200 offices). With its height of 96 m (315 ft), it is one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest, along with Saint Stephen's Basilica. An entrance fee is charged. For tours the adult fee is 2520 HUF, the student fee is 1260 HUF. Payment can be made by cash or credit card."

Any visitor to Budapest cannot miss or be enchanted by the beauty of this building, designed to mimic Westminster but ending up dwarfing it with opulent elegance by a mile or two. Situated on the Pest side of the city and in close vicinity to Margaret Island it overlooks the Danube, casting its overwhelming beauty across the river in a popular challenge to the royal palace and castle hill on the Buda side of the divide. Tickets are cheaper for European citizens so make sure you bring your passport to take advantage of the discount on offer. The guided tour is fascinating and is an excellent introduction to the history of the country, giving a real sense of their identity as a people as an independent nation and later, as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The planar hall and architecture is lavish but the centre piece, in the truest sense, not only for the building but the Hungarians as a people is the Stephen's crown, the crown sent by the pope to the founder of the Hungarian kingdom upon his conversion to Christianity. In this sense, the parliament becomes much more than a house of politics, it becomes the epicentre of the story of nation building for the Hungarians as a people. If you want to get under the skin of the Hungarians, do not miss this place if anything but to be in awe of the splendour and beauty of it."

My Review rating is based purely on time spent around this magnificent building, and then viewing from the river at night, simply stunning! the city is a hotpot of ideas taken from various other cities, for instance the idea of Parliament based on the houses of parliament in London, and then when Pest was destroyed by flood in 1830 it was redesigned on Frances wide boulevards. For the main part of our tour it has to be said that because its not that long ago that it was a communist regime, that many of the buildings while being substantial are to a large extent....boring! However there is no doubt that the parliament with its over the top \"wedding cake\" architecture is the jewel in Pest s crown."

Inside the gilding and ornamentation is stunning, but for me the (excuse the pun) crowning glory is St Istvan's Crown at the top of the grand staircase. St Istvan (St Stephen) was the first King of the Magyars and was beatified. The wonky cross on the top of the crown shows it has been around (on battlefields?) Even though it is not a monarchy it seems that the Hungarians look back to the golden era of their history.Entrance lower for EU citizens.

We took the Italian tour when the English tours were sold out on a Wednesday afternoon, but enjoyed being led through this cathedral-like legislative building. The legislature is now unicameral, and we only were allowed inside the chamber that is no longer used, but it was a very interesting experience.We were led through halls and open areas that rivaled the cathedrals in their opulence, with marble columns, huge paintings on the ceilings, and statues beyond count. There were even ornate brass cigar holders outside the legislative chambers, numbered to each member could keep track of his cigar.Perhaps the most revered symbol in Hungary is the royal crown, work by 52 kings over more than a thousand years. It is on display in a glass case guarded by two soldiers, in a huge rotunda where no pictures are allowed because of the reverence with which it is viewed. If you are interested in statistics, the building has 10 separate courtyards in its nearly 900-foot length. It has 29 staircases, 29 gates, 13 elevators, and 691 rooms. Our helpful hint is this: try to buy your tickets beforehand, or you may be disappointed by not taking the tour in a language you understand. They can be bought on the Internet, but we had no way to print them out and weren't sure if we could pick them up. And if you can't get a tour in your language, take the tour anyway. You will remember the magnificent building long after you forget the detailed explanations."

Details up close dazzle.As for the tour, why should the cost for three rooms only and no photo taking in the main dome hall where the original crown of St Stephen resides be so expensive? This is the house of the people and while EU citizens get a bit of a break, other visitors pay dearly for a brief tour with long security checks and many steps. The meeting chambers and hallways are opulent and impressive but the tour says next to nothing about the government process.In sum, the tour does not match the magnificence of the building except in price."

This is a must see on any visit of Budapest. Unfortunately we were paired with a docent who rushed through the pitifully short tour walking us quickly through the chambers that we were allowed to see and spoke so fast that even if she didn\u2019t have a pronounced accent, we would have had a hard time understanding her. It would have been very tempting to tune her out all together. The tour was supposed to take about 45 minutes. We were shepherded out in 20 minutes. We loved the interior glory of the Parliament, but most of the data presented by our tour guide could easily have been found on the Internet. While we weren't able to spend much time gazing and gawking at the interior of the Parliament, there is one consolation. The stupendous exterior of the building, day or night, is never off limits. From every angle, if you didn\u2019t know its history and current use, you\u2019d think that it was the mammoth imperial headquarters of the Holy Roman Empire."

Fortunately it was within 10 minutes' walking distance from our hotel, so we got to go there on two evenings. The impressive architecture of the building was accentuated by the lights that came on around sunset, making it look breathtaking. It's a great place to hang out, and it's within a stone's throw of the Duna Korzo - the walkway along the Danube river, featuring the 'Shoes memorial'. Do go inside the Parliament building, because it's as spectacular as the outside. Lots of gold and works of art... very ornate, very tasteful, very historic looking. I'd say: Parliament + Duna Korzo make for a well-spent 2-3 hours."

The architecture, carved wood, gilded walls, etc make for a splendid feast for the eyes. At night it lights up and becomes a central focal point in Budapest. In front of the Parliament is also the edge of the Danube where you can see the Shoes along the Danube tribute to the Jewish people executed along the river. The whole city is just amazing. Loved it. Would go back again."

As EU citizens we got in for half price so it only cost about \u00a310.00 for us both to get in. The building is huge and absolutely stunning inside. However, the tour is just over an hour long and you only get to see a small part of the building. Also, there is very strict security procedures to get through not dissimilar to the airport.

Most of Hungary were there during the day waiting patiently in the rain for miles just to get inside to see the Crown of King Stephen and the orb and sceptre which are guarded under the main dome, and this is the only part you cannot take photographs, although plenty try. Visitors like us paid for a guided tour which took in most of the parliament buildiing ending up at the main attraction, however the tours need booking in advance. Later the same day is the procession of St stephens right hand from the basilica to the chain bridge and back, where all the rest of Hungary was , singing the hymns, and applauding the various participants in the parade. A very proud people who obviously have a great respect for their independence and their history.I am very glad I saw it on that day, as it brough home the importance the people attach to their parliament. The building by the way, is well worth the visit !"

Honestly, the whole thing was a little depressing too, as they have this incredible building (2nd largest Parliament building in the world with only London's being larger) and most of it is empty. It really underscores the very sad story of serial occupation in Hungary over hundreds of years. Still, I would recommend it as something you should do while in Budapest."

The tour was in English and began in the new visitor centre. The parliamnet building is always breathtaking. The third largest parliament building in the world and certainly the most opulent it is incredibly rich in decoration. One of the highlights is the Holy Crown of St Stephen, 1000 plus years old, it is the oldest royal crown in Europe and an antique masterpiece. If you are in Budapest, the parliament building is something that simply has to be seen!!! All that said, I have to mention a few criticisms. The tour guide was very knowledgeable, and her English was very good, but she spoke far too fast and not nearly loud enough. The tour felt rushed, and though we saw the Upper House Chamber, and a lobby and the area under the main dome with the Crown and the main staircase , yet it seemed hurried. It was disappointing that we did not go up or down the grand staircase, as the tours ran in the past. The brand new visitor centre is a bit spartan. Anyway Go!"

EU citizens pay a lower admission fee than non-EU citizens. Try to book in advance as certain languages have very limited options. There are many steps on this tour, but a lift service is offered.

Once inside the toothpick recreation of the parliament building was something I never expected to see and it was cool that someone took the time to recreate the building utilizing toothpicks. The interior of the building is grande...the lighting, the high ceilings, stained glass, etc just everything is beautiful. Good to see the Hungarian crown Jewels which are housed under the dome-and NO pictures are allowed in the room/of the jewels. Obviously guarded and was able to see the changing of the guards guarding the jewels. The assembly hall of the house of maneates was also pretty cool to see-its where Parliament conducts their business- beautiful fresco in the background and the cigar holder outside the hall was neat to see. Did not feel rushed at all, but thought we would see more of the building. Still enjoyed it nonetheless."

If you want to see Crown Jewels, go to London, but the inside is amazing. Just beautiful. The guide provided a tremendous amount of information and could answer any question.

It might be worth the painful process to get in if you don't mind being hurried and herded like sheep once you are there. They seem to want to rush you through and out as quickly as possible in 35-40 mins. To be honest I would give the inside a miss and admire the external facade and get photos there."

It led into the Museum of Ethnography and only went out as far as the tram tracks - it looked to be around 30 or 40 people in front of us? We stood in line for at least 1.5 or 2 hours. It took a ridiculously long time to get into the building and to the ticket booth. There was one ticket booth with one person handing printing the tickets - it took her 5 to 10 minutes per person when all was said and done. It was incredibly slow!On a side note, we visited in May of 2014 and they were currently building a new underground visitors centre which might be open now. Hopefully it will have alleviated some of these issues.The tour was very interesting but felt highly rushed. We were told that, because parliament was in session, only half of the normal tour grounds would be open for viewing (the tickets were half price). We were comfortable with that, but unfortunately the areas which were off limits were the most popular and 'magnificent' areas... or so we were told.All in all, the Hungarian Parliament is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it was the most painful part of our time in Hungary. But on the other hand, it's one of those \"need to see\" attractions while you are in Budapest. I would recommend going, but hopefully you are more prepared for some of these problems than we were."

Now that the construction work is finished around it, the Parliament has recovered its outside beauty, this is free and makes great photos, especially if there is no wind and you can use the reflection pool. The best view being actually from the Fishermen's Bastion on the Var.For the inside part, that is another story. It used to be 3500 HUF, suddenly in one week the price jumped to 4000 HUF (almost $20) - honestly not worth the treatment you get. For that huge price you expect a group of 20 maximum with proper guidance in your language since they have designated times for different languages and enough time to take some photos.What we got was a group of 50 herded like cattle, the end of the cattle could not hear a word of the guide yet was being pushed by guards to go faster, faster, faster ... When you are 50, it is hard to all take the same photo, you need to wait - not allowed, move it! No photos of the crown jewels either (get a photo of the copy which lies in Matyas Templom on the Var!).The guided tour is about 40 to 45 minutes, no more - the rest is queuing and passing metal detector machines.As a group you expect a group price - not here. If you wish a private tour it is 10,000 HUF ON TOP of the individual ticket.If you wish to secure your time (and avoid the queue or worse queuing for nothing) you may go on line but you will be charged extra.Bottom line: beautiful but not worth the hassle - perhaps in bleak cold months when there are fewer tourists the experience is more enjoyable."

It's castle like structure fits in so well with the presentation of the city, and having been to Berlin I could not imagine this anywhere other than Budapest. The building is worth a visit during the day, when you can get up close and look at the ornate architecture. But, it comes into its own at night when fully illuminated. My advice, find a restaurant on the other side of the river, and wait for sun to set to see the awesome lighting up of the parliament, and if you look carefully you will see birds flying around the roof, illuminated by the lights and looking like little fire flies."

In the evening glow from the sun it was truly photogenic. And at night it is well lit and can be seem from the river or walking around the building.From the distance at night there seemed to be some artificial flying objects over the building> I came closer look one at midnight and it was hundreds of birds circling on top of the building, lit up from the lights shining from below. Truly amazing. There were a few people around the building but no rough looking characters. One can come with a tripod and camera after 10- 11 PM and shoot wonderful slow shutter shots without having any people in the photos,The tour was very good. We had no problem booking an English tour an hour after we were in the queue. The lines were not too long in July, unlike what other had experienced. The toilets were clean and free. Only thing missing was a water fountain since the day was hot. Unlike USA, drinking water fountains are almost non existent in Europe. What a shame. The tour lasts 40 minutes and is $20 USD for non EU citizens and half of it for EU citizens and children and students.There was some restoration going on but the exterior was good for the most part.I find that something is wrong when neither this nor the Castle district is on the top of the attractions list, and top spots are occupied by Shooting club, TRAP team and Claustrophobia. I have not traveled 4000+ miles to one of the grandest cities in Europe to do such things that I could very well do at home. That is not what Budapest is famous for."

It is beautiful inside as well however the tour leaves you feeling unimpressed, first you can't even hear the guide as there are so many people following this one person around, when she points out something you can not see over all the people to even know what she is talking about IF you can hear her, the less than enthused guide & tour left us unimpressed. A few members of our party got bored just standing in one spot forever and started laughing about something, the guards came up behind and angrily said IT IS NOT FUNNY. Also we had one member that had a hard time going up ALL the stairs, she was struggling, we were not offered use of an elevator, not certain if they even have one. Our tour guide was not allowed to show us around inside which would have been nice so we had to do the group / MASS tour."

Even if I had been here only for an hour and had visited the Parliament, my visit would have been worth the value. Look at it from any angle, it is magnificent in every respect. The best part is that they allow visitors inside the building. This tour though costs HUF 4000, yet it is value for money. If it is magnificent from the outside, it is simply lavish from the inside. The Grand Staircase, the splendid lobby, the elegant House of Magnets, the beautiful sculptures, the appealing frescoes - these are all just fantastic. A must visit while in Budapest or may I say Budapest can be visited to have a glimpse of this imposing building by the side of River Danube."

The first english tour that wasn't fully booked was at 5 pm so don't think that you would just enter and go to a tour. There are also tours in other languages (spanish, german, hungarian and russian- all that I remember). Tickets are cheap if you're an EU student (1000 forints - 3-4 euros) and more expensive for non EU citizens (4000 forints). Tour held for 30-40 minutes and we saw only few corridors, one of the chambers, a dome, a hall with the crown and staircases. Maybe it's not a big tour with lots of things to see but I think it's worth it's prize. Guide gives you lot of information about the history of Hungary."

The only problem is that once you book your tour, you don't have any idea where to wait or who to ask. as your time approaches, a person suddenly comes out and says something and everyone rushes towards the security screening area. They won't screen you until your group time is called, so this causes a bit of a delay in getting everyone inside. The building is beautiful on the outside and it is also highly recommended to see the inside as well. something special about it. You need to stick close to your guide in order to hear everything.

Amazing architecture, interesting history, incredibly clean, and a wonderful tour guide who had lots of stories, facts, and a few jokes to tell along the way. Beautiful setting as well. Plenty of tours go on in English, but if you do have to wait as we did it's extremely pleasant just walking along the river to a nearby Cafe. Wonderful trip, a highlight of the holiday."

Although the tour costs a fair amount of money for just a 45 minute tour, seeing the inner workings of another country's government, especially one with a history of both communism and democracy, was worth it. If you can't do a tour inside, make sure to look down side streets to get special almost alley-way views of Parliament, not to mention views from Castle Hill across the Danube to take in its enormous river-side beauty."

My husband said it \"was not as bad as Versailles\" which, if you've suffered through that experience lately is a fairly condemning comment. Not being EU citizens we paid about $32 USD for a 30 minute tour which wasn't really worth it. I can offer some good advice, though. Although they haven't updated their own website yet, tickets no longer need to be printed across the street at the Ethnographic museum. As of June 1, 2014 they have a new visitor center to the left of the building and down some stairs. You can show your tickets on your mobile phone at the desk right before your tour. And here's some errata: Why does such a tiny country have the second largest Parliament building in Europe? Answer: (according to the Hungarians) Because originally they had a lot of land but everyone (Germany, Russia, Checkslovakia, etc., took their land so now they are a tiny fragment of their former republic. But they still have their big Parliament Building. Interesting fact to know and tell: The U.S. forces, after WWII, took the \"Crown Jewels\" (which would be the actual crown, scepter etc. of the King of Hungary) and stored them in Fort Knox for safe keeping. Jimmy Carter, as President, after deciding their country was democratic enough, returned the crown to Hungary in the 70's, a gesture still remembered and appreciated by Hungarians. I've attached one photo of the interior, so unless you really need to see those crown jewels, I would call this attraction a \"maybe if you have time\"."

I had previously visited 2 years ago but was unable to take a tour of the inside as the online system was only accessible to groups at that time and although we went an hour before opening twice; they were always sold out. This time I used the online system and was able to easily book and print off tickets for our desired date. The grounds of Parliament have undergone quite a renovation in the past 2 years. They are not quite finished but we could see there will be an underground exhibit to the 1956 uprising, a large visitor's centre, new statues, water features and even mist spraying out of the pavement in front of Parliament (a welcome chance to cool off!). It looks really great. For our interior visit we easily found our meeting spot and followed our english speaking tour guide through the guarded gate at our scheduled time. Our group had about 25 - 30 people so was very manageable. The interior is beautifully decorated and our guide gave great explanations and even some humorous little stories. A highlight was seeing the Hungarian crown jewels (the only part of the tour you couldn't take photos). We really enjoyed our tour and wouldn't hesitate to go again."

It especially appeals to my love of symmetry, but the revival Gothic and Renaissance styles are always appealing.Viewed from across the Danube, in Buda, or on the water from a river cruise, this building captivates the senses with its beauty. Probably best viewed at night, when it is lit, it is well worth a stroll over the Chain Bridge after dark, or a romantic sunset dinner cruise when the light is warm, in order to appreciate this building to the fullest.Although we didn't tour inside, I believe it's free to enter if you are an EU resident and you bring your Passport/National ID Card, but there is a charge for those outside the EU. The building is quite large and perfectly symmetrical, so I would imagine a tour would take a couple of hours, unless you chose to quit halfway 'round! ;-)I've attached my night shot of this stunning building with the hope that it might convey the drama and romance of this beautiful building.

There is a slightly buggy website you can access to get your tickets, but our hotel front desk did it for us the day before (Mondays are tough to get in because the legislature \"has meetings\"). We went there on the first day of their new Tourist Herding System, in other words, the new visitor center. It will be very nice once they get the bugs out, but this day not even the bathrooms were working.Because we are not EU members, we paid about $20 each for this tour. We arrived at the time on our tickets, 1:00 p.m. They had to herd us all through security (they were doing two tours--one in English and one in ?? at the same time, so stand close to the tour guide so you can hear). By the time we got through security, it was 1:10 p.m. Our guide was fabulous, speaking an English we could all understand. On the tour we saw a hallway, the main legislative chamber, a receiving room, the crown jewels chamber (no photos in this one, but OK in the other ones), and then stood at the top of the Grand Staircase. Then it was over (it was 1:35-ish). The rooms are ornate, beautiful and the guide's talk was interesting, but twenty bucks for 25 minutes? Really? Later that day we went to the Opera House, and although we only stood in the lobby, I think I would rather have gone there. Furthermore, a friend's cousin, a local who lives there in Budapest, didn't put it the top ten list when they visited last year. Maybe it's only for tourists? That night we took the subway to the first stop across the river and joined the few people there taking photos of the building. It is gorgeous, but I wish I'd spent my hours going to the baths or something else. (Still can't get over that it was about a dollar a minute.) In addition, if you want to pay attention and listen to the guide, you won't have time for photographs, as a very severe looking guard shoos you on into the next room. Listen to your guide, but snap away."

Really nice city, great transportation system. Baths, castle, river tour - all cool and well worth it - but the parliamentt tour and the crush to get in felt like a marketing plan executed well to gin up tourist dollars....Also - first day they wanted a passport to get in then second we showed up with passports and they didn't. Huh? Old commies lurking around?"

(luck of the draw i guess... it was on July 3rd in english at approx 10am). firstly, the group was much too large (around 40+ ppl). the guide lead the pack, and once at her stopping point, rattled off whatever she had to say in a monotone disinterested voice, and then kept walking!! the back of the group had not even reached the stoping point- and certainly had no idea of what she said! it was terrible! my friends were so disappointed. i went and addressed the issue about halfway through the tour - the guide just nodded at me, and walked off. having done many tours in many countries- she was one of the worst ive experienced.

I have visited other parliaments in other cities - and the group size, time allowed to spend and the number of rooms shown is disappointing. The english tour groups are always full and has a lot of people and they just herd people through rooms in short time not allowing to absorb the magnificence, grandeur and the architecture of the place. They should really consider having more english tours and lower the number of the people in the group"

In summary, we loved what we saw - not only the over-the-top external Gothic gingerbread, but also the exceedingly ornate interiors, rooms, & appointments. This is a signature, must-see part of Budapest that we photographed by day & night from two different river boats, from Castle Hill in Buda, & during our tour. The imagination & workmanship are amazing!Having said that, our enjoyment was somewhat diminished by the clumsy, time-consuming tour arrangements & the relatively perfunctory, brief tour of the interior. We had to first meet at a bus near a lot of hotels, wait on the bus, drive slowly thru clogged streets to the Parliament, then wait for 30+ minutes outside before our group could enter the building - all taking well over an hour before the interior tour began. Then our tour guide was brusque, impatient, & often inaudible to many of the tour participants. And he practically ran thru the tour in less than 30 minutes. Rude! Nevertheless, what we saw was fascinating with extravagant details wherever we looked. By the way, the \"crown jewels\" were interesting but anti-climactic: rather limited & crude that paled in comparison to London & Copenhagen.I don't know whether you can tour the building on your own, but if you can, I suggest doing that."

So I was quite disappointed from an atraction standpoint, since you get to see so little and it's way too touristic. Perhaps if they had made a longer tour, and used a part of a building to make a \"parliament exhibition\" with pictures of it being built and such, it would have felt like someting more consistant and with more content.

I was surprised that it was as attractive and that there was as much attention to detail as the exterior.Unfortunately the only way to see the inside is on one of the official tours, which right now are not being run very professionally or cheaply. Contrary to the guidebooks, EU citizens are no longer free. We paid HUF 1750 for an EU citizen and HUF 3500 for a non-citizen. That's a pretty steep price for what ultimately was 30 minutes of waiting for a tour to start and a 30 minute tour. And thankfully we didn't wait in the long queue to buy tickets at their booth (in the Museum of Ethnography across the street). If you do decide to go I highly recommend using the official website and buying your timed tickets online. It cost us HUF 200 to save at least 30-45 minutes waiting in line on a weekday in June.The tour itself was disappointing as well. It was a rather brief 30 minutes long and because of a lack of guards they sent our English speaking tour through with a Hungarian language tour which meant we had to stand very close to our tour guide to hear anything. Am I glad I went? Yes. Would I recommend it? To patient people, yes."

The ticket office is a good distance away in the museum across the street. We waited in line an hour to buy tickets, then had to wait another 45-minutes for our timed entry. Tickets/ tours are available online, and had we planned things better, we would have gone that route. A small museum of treasures near the front entrance was close due to the visiting President.

We arrived to book our tour at 10am in the morning, since the visitors centre was closed we had to queue for tickets in the museum across from the building. The line was very long and after 10 minutes we reached a sign which said that only one person per group was allowed to queue, so I waited outside and left my partner to get the tickets. After 40mins he emerged after receiving some horrendously poor customer service. Firstly a number of school group parties were allowed to go to the front of the queue, and as there was only one (terribly slow) woman serving this made the wait time greatly increase. When he finally reached the front of the line he asked for two EU citizen tickets, when asked he presented his drivers licence as proof of citizenship however she put the sale through as one EU ticket and one normal ticket, which was twice the price of the EU ticket. When he queried this she said that without the other person present with their ID she would not honour the discount. He said that I was just outside so he would go get my ID to show her but she said that if he walked away he would have to go to the back of the queue so would have to take these tickets. Further he only had enough currency for the reduced price tickets so was forced to put the inflated cost on his credit card, thus incurring further charges. We returned when the queue lessened to show my ID and get the ticket swapped, however she was very rude and simply stated that she would not give a refund. When we asked to speak to a member of management she simply kept saying that we would have to take it up with someone in Parliament! When we finally went on the tour it was not 50 minutes long as we were told but only 25mins. You are only taken into 4 rooms in the building so I definitely do not think it was worth the full price ticket. By all means if you can get the reduced price do attend as it was beautiful but on the whole experience was deeply dissatisfying."

Our Guide led us to the Parliament entry point; it was crowded with groups; he went to buy the tickets; returned after 20 minutes to inform us that the queue was too long; never ending, and the next inside tour is after another hour. Therefore, we decided to enjoy the most beautiful building in Pest from the outside. The huge well maintained space outside the Parliament was a very relaxing place to sit and watch the whole area.If you intend to visit the Parliament from the inside; make sure to buy the tickets either online or before the tour day.The attached Photos are self explanatory."

It is a set fare of 750 Huf per person which you pay on board. We passed the Parliament building as we went North from Boraros Ter, and decided to get off. You can see the pictures, but until you actually see it up close you have no idea of the size and magnificent architecture of this impressive building.

It is a magnificent example of neo-gothic architecture and situated on the East bank of the River Danube it is ideally positioned for some spectacular photographs from the opposite bank or from one of the many river cruisers that pass daily. It is supposedly modelled on the Palace of Westminster but to be honest it is more amazing, beautifully symmetrical and better proportioned. The tour was booked beforehand which was a wise move as the queues soon built up and it save us getting soaked waiting for the 45 minute english language tour to start. Magnificent rooms and a glimpse of the central chamber and holy crown. Quite expensive for just 45 minutes but don't miss it!"

We were told that the outside of the building had been recently cleaned and we were not disappointed when we saw it. Even covered with years and years of soot and pollution, the building was beautiful. Now that it is clean, it is even more impressive. We were disappointed, however, that we had to pay the equivalent of about $16 per person because we paid in U.S. dollars. Visitors from the EU pay half that amount.While the building remains an incredible testimony to eclectic architecture, we found that the tour was not as extensive nor as detailed as the one we took about 10 years ago. It was only 45 minutes with minimum information. We were also accompanied by a security guard which was not done previously. I found the purchasing of tickets, the rules for standing in line and the rules for entering the building somewhat ostentatious. In spite of that, the building is definitely worth seeing both outside and inside if one wants to get a sense of the culture it represents."

There was also building works right across the plaza between Parliament and the museum opposite, which was a shame because it ruined half of the view. Buying our tickets was a very long process and the staff were rude. However, once we went inside for the tour, it was very impressive. Everything was lavishly decorated with gold and there was still the crown from Centuries ago inside one of the rooms. The tour guide was very good, and informative. The tour lasted around 30-40 minutes, and was available in different languages.The second time I came to visit, I didn't go inside, but the building works were no longer there so I got to appreciate the building from all sides, and the weather was very hot and sunny!It's definitely worth visiting, and there are some great places to see it from the Buda side too - Gellert Hill, Castle Hill etc."

The Parliament is a beatiful, large building (the 3rd largest parliament building in the world) and is therefore very impressive from the outside.

You can have a tour for around 4 euros (1260 HUF) for students or twice this price for adults. In our opinion, the tour wasn't that special, but it is still nice to see the building from the inside (quite impressive, but not a 100% worth the money)."

The Hungarian Parliament (Orszaghaz) building found at Lajos Kossuth Square and the Danube Promenade is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city and a place that most visitors will include within their list of attractions to see while in Budapest. Parliament was built between 1896 and 1904 and features Gothic Revival architectural which was clearly borrowed from London's House of Parliament building. You can also find evidence of Renaissance Revival architecture can also be found in the dome that tops the building. This seems more like something you'd expect to find in Tuscany instead of here in central Europe. The mix of architectural styles produces a beautiful building exterior that can be admired from up close or across the Danube River on the Buda side of the city. During the day, you can see Parliament with blue skies very well from upon Castle Hill. The building is then lit up each night, producing another spectacular view of the building. Visits inside Parliament can be arranged but there are set times and limited availability. See the Parliament Website for visit and reservation details. Overall, we very much enjoyed seeing the Parliament building from both sides of the river and particularly enjoyed the higher vantage points of Castle Hill at Fisherman's Bastion. It is well worth taking a few minutes to admire the Parliament building from this location when you visit Budapest."

You can't miss it when visiting Budapest as its bang on the Danube river on the Pest side and I strongly advise walking past it at night to check it out lit up, this is truly breathtaking."

It is a fantastic building with lots of history and beautiful decorations.Due to reconstruction works on Kossuth square the ticket office was operating in the Museum of Ethnography, opposite the Parliament. EU citizens get 50% discount. Take a photo ID or passport with you. However they are hoping that the square will be ready for National Day on 15th March.There is tight security on entering the building, similar to an airport system with scans. You can take photographs everywhere except in the Dome (Kupola) where the Hungarian crown jewels are on display.The tour of the building was excellent. The guide who took us around spoke very good English, she was very knowledgeable, and made the tour around the Parliament very enjoyable. The tour takes about 40 minutes. If you want to visit the Parliament when you are in Budapest I would recommend reading the information on: http://www.parlament.hu/angol/angol.htm It tell you all you need to know about opening times, guided tours, maps etc. Enjoy."

[I'm strongly recommending you to visit the scene during both day and night]. I will rate this as excellent!I had also paid and visited the interior of the building. While my German friends asked them of the entrance fee, it was around 4-5 Eur. However, I was quite upset that the counter was telling us for those without an EU passport, one needs to pay 15 Eur. I have a feeling they just simply increased the price. Honestly, I would like to know if this is really true. Anyway, the visit only covered a small area of the building and took less than 30 min in total. The Q and scanning took half an hour or longer."

Its size is huge and in the evening his dome capture colors like never seen before. Try to spend several hours to visit, but I think the best way to enjoy it is to take one of the many boats along the Danube and let go for a few Euros round this fantastic river that divides the city. I suggest you taking the 18/19 hs boat to face the sunset falling on the top of the Parliament. Really worth to visit."

Meant to look like a Medieval Castle and to offer the right kind of venue for the Parliament, this building is one of the main architectural focal points of Budapest. Unfortunately the interior was not open at the time I visited since Kossuth Square surrounding it was under renovation, but I have seen pictures of the inside and it is well worth seeing. This building acted as a symbol of democrasy to Hungarians during the Communist Era."

But the drawback is that you stand in the line to purchase the tickets, you wait about half an hour in the queque and if you are lucky you get in. You struggle to choose from the 6 languages avaliable (En,De,Fr, It, Sp, Hun). And then the tour lasts less than 40 min including the security check and the waiting to get in! You pay 6 Euros as a European citizen (half the normal price) to see about 6-8 chambers out of 691 rooms in the building!!! A while ago EU citizens went in for free but now since the Hungarian government decided that you should not lose the money from 3000 visitors a day they decided to put an entrance fee! It felt nice all of us European citizens to mix and mingle our languages in order to make it into the tour and be amazed by the sheer beauty of this edifice but please do not charge 1 euro per chamber to members of the European family! It is enough to charge 10 and 13% service charge which is obligatory to all bills while it is supposed to go to the waiters but instead the government takes it directly and does not give anything to the staff!! My suggestion is since you have an entrance fee extend your tour to more rooms as they do in Ottawa in Canada or in Westminster. In both cases the tour is free, as it is in many Town halls around the world."

The outside of the parliament building is unfortunately spoilt at the moment by the large-scale remodelling of Kossuth Lajos square; nothing, however, mars the gorgeous interior. Access is only by guided tour (available in a wide variety of languages at different times - check in advance); we had no trouble getting tickets on the day when we went in December, but this may not be true in summer. The only problem with the highly informative tour is its brevity, as it only encompasses a few rooms. These do include the former House of Lords, a mirror of the session chamber still in use, and the grand dome with the crown jewels (which may not be photographed), but not much more. What you can see is definitely worth it if you qualify for the 50% reduction for students or EU citizens on the relatively high 3500Ft ticket price - those not qualifying may which to consider whether a 40 minute tour (including security checks) is worth the price of asking."

To be fair, parliament was in session, which I suppose puts parts of the building off-limits to tours. And there's a lot of construction going on. We were told the tour is normally a couple of hours, but shortened because of construction.

The main entrance faces the river, and inside the main entrance is the main staircase which is where the tour begins.It is the largest building in Hungary. It was built between 1885-1902 in a manner that emulates the British Houses of Parliament. Hungary had a bicameral parliament when it was built so it is perfectly symmetrical to signify the equality of the two houses. Today Hungary has a unicameral government.We took the guided tour in English. Key points of interest include:\u2022 The main stairway with its frescoed ceiling and brass and gold decorations and chandeliers. The decorations are actually gold leaf above 4 meters high. \u2022 The domed hall, with figures of early leaders around the base of the dome and a chandelier which is large enough for a person to climb down from the ceiling to clean and change the lights from the inside. This room, which is the only one where photography is not allowed, holds the crown and coronation jewels. \u2022 The lobbies outside the chambers have brass cigar holders, with numbers on each, so members would know which cigar was theirs.

We walked along the river until we got to the road leading up to it, which was...under construction.

Of course access was denied so we ended up climbing up a wall and over a chain link fence to get near the road leading to Parliament.

Get to booking office early morning or day before to avoid queues or book online. If you are a EU citizen take passport with you for ID when buying tickets and you get a half price ticket for 1750 HUF/\u00a35.

We felt that information (such as terms of booking online/advanced bookings) wasnt really communicated to tourists in the best way!As the title suggests, you need to navigate through and wait in a building site when making your way to the parliament building. So for those with young children or anyone with asthma/breathing difficulties I would think carefully about visiting this place because there is a lot of dust flying about when its windy!The beautiful decor and design of the parliament speak for themselves so make sure you have a decent camera with you! The only thing youre not permitted to take photos of is the hungarian royal crown. Our tour which lasted about 40-45 minutes felt very rushed and almost like it was over before it even began! For a place with so much history you would think they took more pride in communicating this to others but I guess not!"

On arrival, athe lady at the door said tickets were available for the 1pm tour. We joined the queue, which was not long. However, the tickets sales process is an absolute disgrace. Only one person sells tickets. We waited in line for one hour. In that time, several couples had given up and left. Only 6 people in the queue had been served. Tour guides appear from nowhere, waving lists of names and pushing ( literally) everyone else aside. The ticket seller spends ages with each of them totally ignoring the people waiting in the queue.Even though had seen only a few tickets sold, and most of them were for a French tour, by the time we got to the window the only places left for English tours were in the 5pm and 6pm times. We booked for 5pm, tickets were 3500 florin each.The tour left on time. The group was huge, about 40 people, most of whom could actually not speak English. If you subtract the ten minutes it took to get the whole group through the security check, the actual tour was only about 25 minutes. The building was wonderful, but you only see a small section. You can take photos in most of it, which is good since you don't get much time to actually look at anything. Compared to other famous buildings we have visited in Europe, this was very poor value. If you really want to go, try and get your tickets ahead of time, and be prepared for only a short visit. Otherwise, you will be as disappointed as we were."

First of all the entry fee was 3500 Huf (florints) about $18 US. For that amout I was expecting a spectacular tour, especially since the wait in line was interminable to get a ticket. ( My advice is to get to the ticket booth early - between 9 & 10 am to get a time for later inthe day). The tour was perfunctory. I took the Spanish version. We climbed the grand staircase, looked at the crown and went to the legislative chamber. In all it took about 50 minutes, including the security procedures to enter the building. The guide unfortunatley was not good about taking questions. She had her schpiel and was not accessible when it came to questions. The object was to get us in and out quickly.

The normal ticket-office however was closed for renovations, as were the square in front of the building and the surrounding buildings, so we had to buy our tickets in the cellar of the ethnographical museum. Here we had to stand in line for over half an hour, so we missed at least opportunity, but when we were finally able to buy our tickets at 2 p.m. we only had tour of 4 p.m. as an option, which wasn't advertised on any of the leaflets we had.The outside of the building was not visible from all the points of view due to large pieces of railing surrounding the square, but the parts of the building we could see were magnificent. The inside of this building, the largest parliament-building in Europe, is as beautiful as the outside. This inside was shown to us by our English-speaking tourguide, but the tour itself felt somewhat stiff. Also, the group was too large for the guide to handle, so she had her voice amplified by a portable speaker, which didn't help. If you were standing close you were able to understand her perfectly well, but when the distance increased she became harder to understand. Two more things I would like to note. There is one room where it is not allowed to take any pictures; here the Hungarian crown is stored. If you do try to make any pictures, the guards and tourguide will explicitly tell you it is not allowed.The second thing to note is that there are no toilets in the building that can be used during a tour."

Since the building is still in use as Budapest's parliament building, it can only be visited with organised tours. There are tours in English every half hour, French, Spanish, Hebrew...less frequently. Since the area around the parliament building is a construction site right now, you need to buy the tickets in the Ethnographic Museum, which is located behind the parliament building. EU citizen can purchase reduced price tickets, you do need a passport or the like to prove your citizen ship and students under 26 have reduced prices. After you bought your ticket in the museum you have to make it over to the starting point of the tours which is on the north western corner of the parliament building. Give yourselves enough time to find the meeting place since the works have closed of some of the streets leading to the building. Than enjoy."

The building itself is pretty impressive (especially when viewed from the castle or the Danube), but at the moment the square outside is undergoing extensive refurbishments, leaving it a bit of a building site.Tickets for the tour are 1750HUF if an EU citizen, and you must take proof of this in order to qualify for this charge; otherwise it is 3500HUF. Tours run every 15 minutes or so, certain languages crop up more regularly within that cycle than others - we joined the queue at about 12:00, got our tickets at 12:15 and the earliest tour with available tickets was 13:45.The only issue was the rather poor waiting area that they put you in prior to the tour starting. It is essentially just a set of square marquees next to one another, and given the windy conditions that day, the dust from the building site was phenomenal and very uncomfortable. Tours start very promptly but I would not recommend getting there especially early for this reason.The guide spoke good English and was very engaging, showing the historic Coronation Crown and providing a bit of background to the Hungarian political system.It is a very impressive building and well worth a pop in if you are in the area. When the new Parliament Square is finished it will be even more impressive."

Also, In front of the building you will find bronze shoes of all sizes, lining the Danube riverbank.It is a commissioned art piece and a sobering reminder of the horrors perpetrated by Hungarians during WWII, when Jews were randomly rounded up, shot and thrown into the river.Sadly, the mentality which created such crimes against humanity are still very much present in Hungary today, and encouraged by those in parliament under the present Fidesz ruling party, but this should not put anyone off, because the architecture in Budapest is quite stunning, and worth a visit."

Also, better if you don't try to go on Mondays: the queues are always bigger since not many attractions are open on Mondays. They only sell tickets for the day, you can't buy in advance. There's a site online where you can buy the ticket, but you need to be able to print is and they charge an admin fee. I used that site before leaving the hotel to check if there were still places available around the time I wanted, and then bought the ticket right there, no fee."

Because we visited on a Sunday we were able to have an extended visit, and also see the chamber of representatives, not available when Parliament is sitting (3 times a week I believe) Once again we had to marvel at the way in which restorations after the second world war had been effected.

There three ladies were chattering with each other. When I asked for tickets, she told me she could not \"see anything\". What ever that meant I did not know.

The crown, a scepter, and a later sword are all displayed in a case under the huge dome at the center of the Parliament building and they are guarded by two soldiers in splendid uniforms. Admittedly, the light is a bit dim, and one cannot get very close, but the fact that this crown - which dates from about 1,000 AD and was spirited out of Hungary during WWII (held securely at Fort Knox!) - is back in its rightful place in the free nation of Hungary is worth celebrating.

You wait outside for a few minutes then you get divided by language and proceed through security. Our English speaking tour guide had a very thick accent and the acoustics are not the best, so try to get up close (but let the kids in front of you so they can see). When the guide tells you NOT to take pictures in the dome area, take it seriously. They will give you time to take photos WITHOUT flash after the explanation. If you take a photo with flash the entire group will be asked to leave the dome immediately. I am not sure why this is, but it happened to our group. Everyone was given five minutes to snap some pictures but one lady let her flash go off. The minute it did the tour guide freaked and we all had to leave. She said it was good that it happened after the explanation or we would have missed the entire room. The building is pretty and the information provided is very interesting. FYI, there are no visitor restrooms.During the construction it is tricky to find the entrance, but just ask the construction workers or anyone else on the street and they are nice and helpful."

The best places to take in the beauty of the parliament are, due to its huge size across the river. There is a walking path parallel to the river, but if you want more perspective of the building go up to the fisherman's bastion close to the palace on buda hill for a sweeping view of the old city from a beautiful castle wall in front of the colorful roof church.

I didn't have the issue with tickets, as I came with a tour and they took care of it for us, so I can't speak to that end. The tour takes about an hour, and being able to see all the interior detail is worth coming to visit. The crown jewels are impressive- it's amazing to look at something that's 1000 years old. Be aware that you can take photos of the crown jewels, but with no flash. If anyone of your group takes a photo with the flash, the entire group gets moved to the next room! Also, there are no public restrooms here, so be sure to go if you need to before entering for your tour. Our guide was good, spoke English well and was informative. Worth the visit if in Budapest!"

We were told to come back today to buy them. We did, only to find out that we had to come back 2 1/2 hours later for the tour. By 1:00 or earlier, they were sold out for the day. Our guide was okay but it was hard to hear him as he spoke softly and swallowed a lot of his words. The most interesting part was seeing where the House of Commons meets but there were so many in our group, I had to wait for him to finish and the group to exit that little cubby hole, and then dart in to glance around and take a few pix. It is a pretty place inside but really, the outside is the impressive view. If you don't want the hassle or are short on money, walk around it... better still, go across the river and see it from there... or from a tour boat at night. Now that's spectacular!"

The tour itself was fine, but short compared to others we have been on, and the guide was really just running through the motions. It went for less than 40 min, despite being advertised as a 1 hour tour. The building itself is very beautiful, but more impressive from the outside than the interior. Would recommend that non-EU citizens take in its beauty from the outside, or better yet, the view from Castle Hill across the river.

If you are planning to take the tour (which I recommend) buy tickets in advance through internet. It will save you hours of waiting in line."

They let you see very little of the inside of the building. So prepare yourself for about 4-5 hours waiting time, and half an hour visit... But you can Not visit Budapest without seeing the Parliament.. Try to think positive, and get the best out of the visit."

The tour is scorted by a soldier to hurry you up if you slow down or stop longer for a picture.

First the pros; the building is very pretty from the outside (without taking a tour or talking to anyone), the decor inside is beautiful and they have a lovely carpet.Now the cons (of which there are many) per advice from tripadvisor we had prebooked ourtickets online which was easy. However being organised people we thought we would go early to get through security. BIG MISTAKE. We were twenty minutes early and there was actually very few people there when we arrived. They made us wait outside in the pouring rain for twenty minutes, across the road from the actual building. The staff did not explain this and if you stepped off the footpath to cross towards the building were very rude. At the appointed time and not a minute before they came out to collect the tour groups for English and German at this time there were at least 200 people waiting some of whom didn't have tickets and didn't realise you needed to cross the road to get the tickets. Then they take you into the building, we waited 20 minutes to get through security, and were still out of the building by the appointed 45 mins therefore the actual tour lasted 25 mins.Only saving grace it was quite cheap. However I would never waste the time to go again.If you do want to go I would advise people to get the tickets before and going straight to the top of the queue as there were so many people there when we were leaving that both the queues for people with tickets and those without had joined and they don't shout to the back of the queue annoucing tours are starting they just expect people to know.P.S. just to warn people there are no public facilities like a bathroom in the building."

However, we were told that we could go to a smaller queue and wait for our tour. We had to wait a little while and in this short period of time, we learnt a lot about the ticketing system, if you hadn't pre-booked. The queue was still very long, when people were told that the tickets have been sold out. The people at the very front of the queue must have been waiting for at least an hour and were very angry to say the least. The tour was very short, but informative. The building itself was stunning.

I can't overstate how rubbish the tour was with a guide who I had mistaken for a somnambulant due to the lack of interest even she had. There is nothing to see in this building.

Not surprising, given that it is a working building, but perhaps it could be expanded (eg. a brief view of a debate). 45 minutes isn't really enough.It's best to buy your timed tickets before you go (quite easy by doing a web search) - even then entry is quite a hassle. You need to be at the eastern entrance (more or less opposite the end of Alkotmany u.) in good time. The guide will let you through the chain fence, then you have to queue up for a security check.

However, I hope to offer some tips on getting into it in the first place, which is not obvious!There is a \u201cwaiting area\u201d in front of the Parliament on the Kossuth Lajos ter (near where Alkotmany street meets the square), where many people are milling about with or without tickets. Zoom into the square on Google Earth and you see a crowd of people at the edge of the small park - that's the place. In order to purchase the tickets (if you have not done so online), you need to pass a chained entrance in the fence which is guarded by a soldier to get to the ticket office, which is in the Parliament building itself. Many people wait, expecting that there are specific times when you are allowed to pass, but we found that you just have to be a bit bold and ask the soldier to pass and then he usually lets you through no problem. At the ticket office, you are asked for a passport to buy the ticket \u2013 I think there are different prices for locals, EU citizens and others\u2026 but I am not 100% certain of that. But it is best for at least one person in the party to have a passport on hand. After buying the ticket you go back out to the \u201cwaiting area\u201d. This is the place you need to be to start your tour, arriving 5-10 minutes before your planned tour time. You will be called by your guide and escorted back through the chained entrance to your tour. Best not be late for the tour time since the group all passes at once and disappears into the building.Our tour was on a Friday morning and we had an hour to kill before our tour started and luckily found an interesting outdoor food market under the arcades of the Rural Development Ministry \u2013 the big building on the right facing the Parliament on the square. Not sure if this is a daily market but it is worth the short detour if it is going on while you are nearby.One last remark - the tour does not appear to be handicapped-friendly. There are many stairs and I did not notice alternate wheelchair routes!"

My problem with the tour was two-fold; in the first place, you don't get to see more than 20% of the place, and in the second, we got unlucky and had a tour guide whose English was so heavily accented, we missed half of what she had to say. It was particularly difficult for the Swedes and others on the tour.The whole thing was over in an hour or so. If anyone from this attraction reads this, you could resolve many issues by loaning a printed guide of the key points at the start of the tour. Get there by tram."

So I stayed for a while, and more often if I just went through this town on a trip to Vienna, Bratislava, Prague or a some German city. I knew that this large and prominent city of Hungary and Central Europe created by merging two smaller, barely separated longtime habitat. Of course it was a Pest and Buda. Therefore, it was not a little surprised when I learned that in all this unification participated and a third of the village - Obuda! However, it is more about the etymology, I would say, ethnic and linguistic story, but the existence of the third segment in the creation of Budapest. Obuda is actually part of the historic village Buda or Serbo-Croatian Budim: The name means Old Buda in Hungarian. The name in Croatian and Serbian for this city is Stari Budim, but the local Croat minority calls it Obuda. The name \"Buda\" they use for the fortress in settlement Buda.The island (\u00d3buda Island) next to this part of the city today hosts the Sziget Festival, a huge music and cultural festival. However, formally and legally Budapest has made the three communities. And all of them legal, legislative and monumental connects Parliament! This mighty edifice, on the banks of the Danube, it can be seen from any place on one side or the other side of the river. Any bridge to go sight you must stop at the impressive outlines of Parliament. I had the impression that me through Budapest continually monitors its physiognomy. It is located in the Lajos Kossuth Square on the Pest bank of the Danube. It is currently the largest building in Hungary, and the second largest Parliament in Europe. Similar in design to the Palace of Westminster, it was built in Gothic Revival style with a symmetrical facade and a central dome by Imre Steindl. It is 268 m long, 123 m deep and 96m high, the number 96 Refers to the nation's millennium, 1896, and the conquest of the later Kingdom of Hungary in 896. Construction was started in 1885 and the building was inaugurated on the Millennial anniversary of the country in 1896, although only completed in the 1904. Architect Imre Steindl unfortunately blinded before its completion, so never saw the result of his grandest architectural plan which includes 40 kilograms of gold.When entering the Parliament, can go up great ornamental stairs, see frescoes on the ceiling and pass by the bust of the creator, Imre Steindl, in a wall niche. Other statues include those of \u00c1rp\u00e1d, Stephen I and Hunyadi J\u00e1nos. One of the famous parts of the building is the hexadecagonal (sixteen-sided) central hall, with huge chambers adjoining it: the Lower House, where the National Assembly meets today, and the Upper House. The Holy Crown of Hungary, which is also depicted in the coat of arms of Hungary, has been displayed in the central hall since 2000. Further features include the stained glass and glass mosaic paintings by Miksa R\u00f3th. In the wake can be crossed with suburban railway, but I decided to move to the other side through \u00c1rp\u00e1d Bridge or \u00c1rp\u00e1d h\u00edd. From the top of the Buda hills I looked at the Pest, which is just getting ready for the night. I saw my first Parliament. What looked like a great ocean Cruise ship. What is strayed on the Danube."

The clue only got shorter closer to the cut off for the final tour of the day at 2:00 p.m. It came to my notice a women handing brochures for a restaurant was also assisting the clue jumpers. The alarmingly it came to my notice that this woman and one of the men looking after the clue were assisting these people. In other words bribes or kick backs were being paid.

With its height of 96 m (315 ft), it is one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest, along with Saint Stephen's Basilica. The number 96 refers to the nation's millennium, 1896, and the conquest of the later Kingdom of Hungary in 896."

We visited Budapest in January and there weren't many tourists around, so we had no problem going to Parliament at 10:30 and getting tickets for the English tour at noon. The tour was very informative, and the tour guide seemed quite knowledgeable about the history of the building as well as Hungarian history. The tour wasn't particularly long (about 45 minutes) and only really hits on 4 major rooms in the building, but they are impressive. Given that the outside of the building was covered in scaffolding for renovation, it was worth going inside to see how impressive it truly is. My only complaint is that it would have been nice to have a smaller tour group and possibly see a bit more of the building."

Visited in Jan 2012, and as it is was a cold midweek day, were able to book on the spot( at 12.30) for the next tour (at 1pm); As I am a wheelchair user, we were seperated from our 'group' and led through a differant entrance and into a staff lift - after clearing security (it is like an airport security check). We were taken to the top of the grand staircase - where we waited the rest of our tour group, but which meant we missed the first little bits of information given by the tour guide; She continued her tour and we tagged back on; much information was given, and at the end she offered the chance to ask questions - but no one did. A very grand place and nice to see. The tour only took 45 mins, so we were able to fit it in and get on the next hop on hop off bus, and so we were pleased with the shortness of it. Worth spending 45 mins whilst in the area to see inside.Current cost is 1750HUF pp for adults from EU and 3500 for adult non EU - under 18's half above prices."

However, i had been 7 years ago and didnt have a problem them so we decided to give it a go again. We walked up to the building at around 11am and walked up to the information sign saying what times the tours for different languages were at. There was an english one at 12 so we walked up to the guard at the 'buy tickets' sign who pointed us towards a door with 'x' over it. We walked in and down the stairs to the small ticket office area. We queued for around 5 mins then got two tickets for 3500 ft total by showing our uk id. It wasnt free but think it was discounted by showing the id. We then walked back out to the information sign and stood by the 'with tickets' sign until the tour at 12. There is security to go through so be prepared to empty your pockets or put your handbag through the scanner with your coat and walk through the metal detection machine. The tour was great and you can take photos all the way around you just cant use your flash in the dome hall where the crown jewels are. Well worth doing."

The first day we went there there was no information at all and a lot of tourists wandering around not sure where to go. Eventually someone told us that a guard had told them the parliament was closed that day so that was that. For one of the main attractions in the city it has pretty much no information available for tourists. We went back the following day and got in okay. It was free to get in for EU residents and there was a free tour. Although you only really get to see a small part of the parliament and you are rushed through on the tour it is very impressive and well worth the visit!"

You can visit it as part of a guided tour and I'd highly recommend doing this. The tours leave very regularly; lots of people quote 10am, noon and 2pm for English speaking tours, but we found (on a weekday in December 2012) there were English tours leaving all through the day, including ours at 2.45pm. You have to go to the Parliament (door X - security will let you in if you tell them you want a tour ticket) to get a ticket in advance, and if you show ID proving you to be a citizen of an EU country there's no charge. The tour itself takes 45 minutes or so and includes a look at the Crown of St Stephen, the symbol of the Hungarian State. If you go on a tour beginning at 45mins past the hour (as we did) you'll also get to witness the hourly changing of the guard around the crown! It was very interesting to see inside this building, and I'd highly recommend it if you have an hour to spare when in Budapest."

If you are a member of the EU then you can tour it free. If however you are not an EU member it costs the equivalent of about $18 for a tour. The tour leads you through yet another metal detector, Up a whole bunch of steps- into a room to see the \"crown\" and then into a meeting room and then to the chamber to see where everyone sits when they are working. Big Whoop. The tour guide couldn't have been more bored or less caring if anyone could keep up with her or even if anyone heard.So this review reflects the spriit in which the tour was given. She crowded people into and out of things as fast as she could and then demanded we leave because the tour is over! Maybe it was a language thing.I must admit that it was all the things people say, lavishly ornate, huge, impressive highly decorated, superlative this that and the other thing. But, the only special moment it held for me was when we approached Budapest at about 11pm by river boat and saw the whole building lit up like some kind of fairy tale. That truly was impressive.If you like big impressive buildings that are highly decorated, lavishly ornate, over done ( i mean the numbered brass or maybe gold plated cigar holders were a bit over the top) and well kept up even though they are still undergoing restoration then this is for you. As for me I was rushed through so fast I had no time to enjoy 3 dollars worth let alone 18 dollars worth. Go see St Michael's instead."

The Parliament is accessible with Line 2 of the Budapest Metro, from the Lajos Kossuth Square station.The Parliament is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary, one of Europe's oldest legislative buildings, a notable landmark of Hungary and a popular tourist destination of Budapest. It is currently the largest building in Hungary.Similar to the Palace of Westminster, the Parliament Building is in the Gothic Revival style; it has a symmetrical facade and a central dome. Also from inside the parliament is symmetrical and thus has two absolutely identical parliament halls out of which one is used for the politics, the other one is used for guided tours. It is 268 m long and 123 m wide. Its interior includes 10 courtyards, 13 passenger and freight elevators, 27 gates, 29 staircases and 691 rooms (including more than 200 offices). With its height of 96 m , it is one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest, along with Saint Stephen's Basilica. The number 96 refers to the nation's millennium, 1896, and the conquest of the later Kingdom of Hungary in 896.The main fa\u00e7ade faces the River Danube, but the official main entrance is from the square in front of the building. Inside and outside, there are altogether 242 sculptures on the walls."

So the easy way is to send a mail to the parlament (chack the web site): idegenforgalom@parlament.hu give your preferable tour language time and number of people with you (can be even one) They are very responsive so you will get the confirmation letter within a day or two. Take the confirmation letter and go to gate X (you need to show it to the officer) no need to stand the line. you can come 15 minutes before your tour starts. The tour takes 50 minutes."

Afterwards take a walk down to the Danube and see the metal shoes along the edge(to the left of parliament as you walk down) It is very sad but the artwork is amazing."

They normally will confirm your booking in an hour by send you a Confirmation Letter stating all details. Then you go to the Gate X (backside of the Parliament, close to the Eternal Flame) 15 min. before the tour starts, pay the booking fee (3500 HUF for non EU citizens and 1750 HUF for EU citizen), get your tickets and join the guided tour. They only accept Hungarian cash or credit cards, and photos can be taken into the Parliament building. There are no public cloak rooms or lavatories. Also please note that tours can be cancelled at any time by the Parliament.Thanks to \"Budapest1972\"!! Good luck!"

Through most hotels or the abundant tour kiosks around town, you need to join one of their excursions. Yes, it will cost a little more, but you WILL get in. Tour groups have appointment times, and a new group enters the building every 10 minutes. Groups stay together with their guide, and are in the building about an hour. A good guide will provide a wealth of information, on both the building and the history of the Hungarian people's, during that time. There are 96 steps inside that you must to able to walk. You will go through a security screening prior to entering. Most guided groups do NOT take you back to your hotel. Did not see any elevators in the building."

Although the building is very much worth a visit (inside and outside), the queueing system needs to be completely rethought. We were advised that advance tickets were not necessary. Having arrived 30 minutes before the first scheduled tour, we waited almost two hours to obtain tickets and then had to wait a further 30 minutes to be admitted. People were queue jumping and the ticket allocation process was very tedious.In addition to recommending pre booking your ticket, you should also bear in mind that if you are an EU national, you will be admitted free of charge on production of your passport."

The free city walking tours are much more informative.However, if you have plenty of time, the inside of the parliament building is truly magnificent. Its opulence is more like that of a royal palace or a cathedral. The genuine, original Crown Jewels are also on display and can be photographed which is a rarity.The Queue Facts:It took us two hours to get to the front of the queue and when we did our 2pm tour was solde out. Luckily, they had more tours available than were listed on the website, so we got a 3.30pm tour.No information is given out during this time, there is only one staff member who manages moving people from the queue (outside in the heat) to the ticket office (inside - there is only one ticket counter). You have no way of knowing if your tour is sold out or when the next tour will be.The queue might look short, but dont be decieved. Expect about two hours (August). You cant buy tickets for the next day.The tour is free for EU citizens, for an Australian it set us back 3,500 HUF.Bring some form of I.D.Once you have your ticket you can leave and come back 5 mins before the tour without rejoining the queue.Once your tour starts, 10 minutes is spent going through security, you then have about a 30 minute tour and then 10 minutes for questions and to file everyone out of the building.So as i said, if you are patient and have time to spare (going at 8am would probably be wise if you are determined to do it and dont want to use the best part of a day), then do the tour. Otherwise try something that gives you a more thorough history of Budapest, like the walking tour or the House of Terror."

First time we had to wait for over an hour to get tickets and then we just lost patience. Second time we got up at 7am to get there at 8am. We still had to wait almost an hour to get our very, very expensive tickets for what you get. Apparently EU citizens get their tickets for free, while others have to to foot the bill and it's obvious because the tickets are crazy expensive for a city like Budapest especially - $14, more expensive than the most expensive European museums. The tour is disappointingly short and we felt like we got ripped off and our money went to subsidize our fellow Europeans. If you only include the time that they actually explain things to you, it's probably not longer than 10 minutes. Although the building is beautiful and history intriguing it was built only 100 years, by European standards it's brand new."

The Parliament is a magnificent Neo-Gothic building with impressive statuary around it. It is fabulous inside and the accomplished tour guide gave a great presentation. It was fascinating to hear that for Nationalistic reasons in the late 1800s only Hungarian architects, artists, workers etc were involved in its construction, which finished in 1902. The great staircase and ornate ceilings and columns are most impressive. Some Hungarian treasures are on view in the central hallway. The debating chambers with their circular wooden seating are very decorative.

The tour itself is not 50 min as advertised, but only 30, and this because the guide is telling the history of the place. Otherwise, 15 min. It is very beautiful on the outside, but think twice before waiting at the line. It s not worthing...."

We went back earlier the next day, only to find out that due to an official visit to the building, all tours were cancelled that day. We were nice and early the third day and scored 4 tickets for the English tour. Mind you, European citizens go free (so my 2 dual citizen kids and I didn't pay, but of course we still had to be included in the headcount and issued a ticket); my husband paid 3500 Forints.The building and the Crown Jewels are beautiful. It was a relatively short 45 min. guided tour, but my kids were becoming a little restless towards the end, maybe because our guide was a little difficult to understand in English."

We were later told that the tour groups are able to book ahead on line so buy out most of the spaces ahead of time. One of the workers at the parliament told us to book online too; but when we went on the website there was only a place for groups not individuals to book. There was an address to contact them by email, where they might have been able to give tickets to individuals, but we ran out of time so were unable to test it out.Even if you can't get inside I highly recommend you see the exterior."

The building stretches 268 meters in its length, along the Danube embankment. Ornamented with white neo-gothic turrets and arches, it forms the most outstanding landmark of the Pest side horizon. Statues of Hungarian monarchs and military commanders decorate the outer walls. The unique interior design includes huge halls, over 12,5 miles of corridors, a 96-meter high central dome, and 691 rooms. When the Parliament is not in session, all these can be visited (cameras are allowed but with restriction at certain places to take the photos); tours are offered in English, French, German, Russian, Hebrew, Japanese, Italian and Spanish.One has to buy the tickets early and there is always a long quque for the same.It give a different pleasure to see it in night in a boat cruise"

If you arrive early morning the line is shorter but if you arrive any later than noon to buy tickets you won't get them. Tickets are sold for same day visits. However, you can reserve to buy tickets online at www.parlament.hu. You pay a reservation fee and then you skip to the front of the line to go in and buy tickets. We didn't think it was worth that so we waited in line which took about 30 minutes. They only allow a few people in at a time to buy tickets so that is why there is a line. Cost is about 3500 forint (approx $17.00) per person. Make sure you ask for tour in the language you want and they will give you appointment time to come back for your tour. Take an umbrella with you in the summer as there is no shelter area to wait in line and it is HOT. Umbrella will help keep you cooler. Inside it is beautiful. Be sure to watch the changing of the guards - it is really neat. This event take place each hour. The guards are their to secure the area that holds the Hungarian Crown. It is a huge glass encased centerpiece at the top of the stairs. The crown itself is supposedly original and was sent by Pope Sylvester II to crown Istvan on Christmas Day in the year 1000. Over history, the crown was stolen, lost, and hidden. The US government kept the crown in Fort Knox between WWII and 1978 until Jimmy Carter returned it. The Parliament was built from 1885 to 1902. The architecture and carvings are amazing! It is both neo-gothic and neo-renaissance. All built with Hungarian hands and Hungarian materials. If Parliament is in session you will only see the House of Lords side. It is amazing and very worth the tour. Enjoy!"

The building is extremely impressive, but you only get to see the grand staircase, the Hungarian crown, and the legislative chamber that is no longer used. That space is rented out for meeting s and conferences, and lucky for us we were able to see it. They were in the process of setting up for a conference and the tour guide told us that later that day it would be off limits.

After queuing for 10 minutes, I was let in to buy tickets. Earliest options were the Spanish language tour at 2.45pm, French language tour at 3.15pm, and English language tour at 3.30pm. I went for the French language one. As a EU citizen, I had nothing to pay. The Hungarian tourism board has a tent next to the line, distributing water for free and providing helpful advice with a smile.The tour starts with a brief overview of the history of the Hungarian parliament, and a general description of the architecture. You are then taken straight to the Hungarian crown jewels, arguably the object that has the most significance to Hungarians. Sure, it is not shiny and glittery, but it is significant, and quite beautiful in itself. The guide then takes you to the seat of parliament itself. Again, a very beautiful room, and obviously very significant to this young democracy. After a brief annecdote, the tour ends.In summary, it is a very interesting and very beautiful tour. Yes, it is brief and you must book your ticket in the morning, but I was grateful to be shown such historically and politically significant object and rooms - for free! Keep in mind that this is the seat of the legislature and you are being shown Hungary's most precious artefact."

You need to bear in mind that this is still a sensitive building in terms of security so you can forgive the prying eyes and slight air of suspicion, but it is great that it is opened for public viewing as the interior is a veritable feast for the eyes. The tour lasts about 45 minutes and you are taken up the main staircase dripping with gold and displaying iconic Hungarian figures. You are then shown the Hungarian crown guarded by two soldiers who could be mistaken for statues (this is the only part of the tour where you cannot use flash photography). Finally you are taken to the centrepiece and highlight of the tour the upper house chamber. A quirky little aside is the cigar ashtrays outside that members of parliament used in the past. The shorter the cigar the better the speech was inside the chamber and vice versa."

On my second, the same boards were showing and with no other information displayed, I caught the eye of one of the attendants standing on the other side of the rope. He quite dimissively tapped on the very board I had seen whilst looking in the opposite direction, showing utter contempt for me. When I told him that I could see the board but wanted more information he said that it was not possible to book a tour but the next available tours were at 8am and 4pm the following day.I did return a few days later only to see that due to official business, parliament tours were not available.

The website clearly stated 3 tours in English daily at 10am, 12pm, 2pm. We heeded the advice of someone on TA and got there just before 8am. There were about 6 people in the queue, some waiting for multiple tickets for friends etc. There seems to be a permanent sign saying no tickets available for that day. Please ignore this. At 8am, a worker came and allowed 2 people into the ticket office. When they emerged, he allowed another 2 and so on. We got into the ticket office about 8.18 and were told there were only tickets available for the 8.45am tour! I asked about later tours and was told there was none. Fortunately we were able to do the 8.45am which worked out better as it meant we didn\u2019t have to leave and come back. The American guy in front of us had to buy his tickets (ours were free with EU passport) but wasn\u2019t sure he could get back to the hotel to get his daughter and make it back in time for the tour. It seems he didn\u2019t make it as I didn\u2019t see him on the tour.Anyway, once you\u2019ve got your ticket the interior of the building is impressive. Our tour guide, Livia, was a friendly lady very knowledgeable in all things relating to the history of the building and the Hungarian government. Tour lasted about 45-50 mins and you can ask questions as you go.If you get the chance, also view the building from the river. We did so on a day cruise and a night cruise \u2013 it\u2019s gorgeous when lit up. Now, I\u2019ll go see how easy it is to arrange a tour of Westminster\u2026."

They let you through the fence 4-5 people at a time and you walk across to the ticket office. They give you a ticket with a specified time on it, then just before that time come back to the section of the fence labelled \"have ticket\" which is just to the right of the section to buy the ticket. A guard will open the fence at that time, then you have to go through x-ray. Tour last about 45 mins. Very beautiful and ornate inside. Can take photos. By the way if you arrive early in the morning at 7.30am and the sign by the buying tickets says \"no tickets let for today\" don't necessarily believe it, as today they had just not turned the sign around from the day before, and I got a ticket. Highly recommended if you have time, but the ticketing system is a real pain!"

Our guide talked her way in and emerged with tickets for us. She had they often close tickets to foreigners to make sure that Hungarians get access (fair enough). I am sure that without a guide we'd never see the interior, which was fabulous. And a guide is a necessity to learn all about the details."

It is fascinating to tour, but also interesting to walk around on the outside as well. Sitting along the Danube, it is lit up at night, and provides endless photo ops, either night or night. There is also a number of significant buildings or points of interest in the square or area immediately surrounding Parliament, such as Szabadsag Square with the Reagan Statue, the state of Nagy Imre, the Eternal Flame, and the Ethnographic Museum. Visitors to Budapest should, in the very least, visit the outside of this beautiful and significant building."

He saw the sign that said there were no more tickets available....usually he would have just left and not pursued it. However, since he thought maybe he could get tickets for the next day he stayed in line and when he got to the window they said no, you can only get tickets for that day. He said, well the sign says your tickets are all gone, they said, no we have tickets for today. He said that many people in line, when they saw the sign, turned around and left. Please, if you don't have tickets go through the line and chances are good that you can get them for that day. It is worth going on the tour to see the beautiful inside of the building."

To book tickets you need to get there in the morning (opens at 8am, tours start at 10am - the guard at the queue told us that on busy days the tickets can be gone by 10am, so get there early in peak season). Location of ticket office is on signs around the perimeter of the buidling, so it is easy to find. There are two orderly queues - one for people waiting for a tour, and one for the ticket office. Remember your EU passport - then tickets are free! If you don't have a passport, you will to pay 3200 forints for an adult (about 11euros) - so it is definately worth bringing it along. I am unsure if I personally would have bothered to have got to the ticket office for 8am for the tour, but, on my visit (on a Friday in April) I got there after 10am and the queue was short, and I was booked on a tour for 12:45. Tour itself is interesting, and takes an hour including ten minutes getting everyone through the security checks. Building is very grand and ornate and you get to see the Hungarian Crown Jewels, guarded by sword bearers. The guide had a very dry sense of humour which was entertaining and engaging, and he dealt with some stupid tourist questions with grace and speed (such questions as 'is this the parliament building which the parliament uses?' and 'are there elections for the MPs')."

We saw it from the Castle, from the Danube, from a bus tour, from St Stephen's, so pretty much from every angle. Every time it looked beautiful and made us more and more excited for the tour inside. We knew that there were tours throughout the day in English so turned up around lunchtime one day to try and get tickets. A very abrupt and unhelpful guard told us that all tickets had sold out by 9.30am and that we'd need to get there at 8.00am to get tickets. After much debate - was it worth getting up early and rushing breakfast etc etc - we decided that it would be worth getting to Parliament for 8.00am for tickets. So, we showed up at the end of the already quite considerable queue at 8.00am. After queuing for OVER AN HOUR, we were finally let into the ticket office. The woman on the desk spent literally ten minutes flicking through a spreadsheet and then gave us our tickets for the 12pm tour - apparently the earlier tour was fully booked. Anyway, we came for the tour, which was led by a very strict 'school ma'am' who at one point told the group off for taking photographs when we should be listening to the presentation. In my opinion, it really wasn't worth the effort. Maybe I'd have a different opinion if we hadn't had to waste so much time queuing, but other sights - such as the Opera House and St Stephen's Basilica - were just as stunning (if not more) but without the hassle."

My tour was planed to be startet at 10.15, so I decided to walk around and take pictures, since it was nice weather I could even sit in the garden right next to the parliament and read some history about the building. Time went fast!They open at 8am to sell the tickets. There are two entrances:1.- The first one is to get the ticket you choose language and time for the tour. 2.- The second one is another entrance for the tour itself. You have to be there 5 minutes before. You show your ticket and then you get in with your group.Before getting into the building you pass a security control (like in airports), this can take some time before all the group is ready.You are allowed to take pictures or film the whole tour, BUT the guide asks you to turn of the flash before getting into the Dome Hall where you can se the Hungarian crown. You still can take pictures but without flash.The building is amazing, with a lot of history and culture, you getEven if the tour last 40 minutes I guess is worth it.

Don\u00b4t believe this, just stay there with the crowd and wait until you get in and get your ticket!Thus, don\u00b4t forget your passport if you are EU-citizen (it is for free!), get there early, take a nice camera with the possibility to take pictures without flash and read some facts before getting there, this will help you understand and admire the parliament even more!"

We were aiming to go on the 10.00 am English tour but by the time we got there it was fully booked so we got our tickets for a later tour. To while away our time we visited the Ethnology museum opposite which was a beautiful building but the museum had hardly any visitors! Would also recommend going to Farger Kave cafe which sells great hot chocolate. When we went back for the tour - the tour leader was a real character which made the tour quite entertaining! Well worth a visit - tour lasts 45 mins."

Otherwise, for non-EU members, the fee is 2520 HUF (~11.50 USD) and half that for students with the appropriate International Student ID card AND Passport (and no older than 26 years old). The building is amazing - inside and out. Gives a great picture to the opulence of early 20th century Hungary. As far as I could tell, there were no elevators for the tour -- and there are many steps (96 to get up to the great hall). Highly recommend!"

The only way to see the parliament building is by taking a guided tour which is available in a range of languages throughout the day. It is advisable to buy tickets early in the morning for a tour that day as they get booked up quite quickly. Tickets are free to EU citizens, it was a little confusing when it came to buying tickets, you have to ask one of the policemen to let you through to buy a ticket (you also need to provide ID in order to get through as well) they also only let people through one at a time to buy tickets (not sure how this works in peak season but it wasnt too bad in march)Once you have finally brought your ticket the tour is very informative and definitley worth doing. The parliament building is very impressive both inside and out and you can take as many pics as you long (without flash). During your stay in Budapest it is also worth taking a trip to the Buda side of the Danube and take pics from the other side to really see the whole sight.There is quite strict security before entering, similar to the airport but this only takes a minute or two."

The parliament is beautiful both from inside and outside and you'll get to see the large staircase, main hall with the St. Stephen's crown and the former upper chamber of the parliament and basically that's it. I've had a chance to do a bit more extensive tour as a part of a law students' organisation meeting so probably there was the case. Anyway the tour is quite short, but it takes about an hour due to all the waiting and all security precautions. Well worth a visit though."

I had booked via email to visit the Parliament in the morning on a specific date at 10:00 for the English language tour. However, I did talk to people who joined me on the tour who had not pre-booked and there was no queue to speak of since it was January and low-season for tourist travel. By the way, if you are an EU citizen, take your passports with you and you will not have to pay any entry fee to visit the Parliament. I was early so I walked around and admired the first and second runner-up buildings for the Parliament building which are located opposite it and used for other purposes. The first runner-up still has large round bullets in it fired during the Uprising of 1956.I enjoyed my guided tour to this opulent historic building. Information was well presented and the decor was marvelous.I saw the Royal gem-encrusted crown and insignia under a stunning well-lit dome, surrounded by statues of Hungary\u2019s great kings. I visited the House of Commons. Saw a small contingent of guards do a march past into the House of Commons that was occupied by some members.I saw the Eternal Flame in front of the Parliament Building and took a picture in front of it.I visited the Memorial of the Uprising of 1956 which is located on the grounds of the Parliament building. The Flag at the Memorial has a hole in the center where protestors cut out the Communist Seal the Soviets had added to their Hungarian Flag."

Tours are offered in various languages.The main problem I have with this place is the unclear ticketing system. I showed up waited on line for 40 minutes then was told that tickets are sold out and that I should order them online or by phone. It seems that an online ticketing system does not exist and it's impossible to get ahold of them by phone. I went back again and finally found out that I could get tickets a day in advance (I was told earlier that I could not). Once I received a ticket and waited in line again there was no announcement that we could be let in so a group of us waiting in line just made it in time after asking. This mess of a ticketing system needs to be sorted out especially since this is one of the highlights of the entire nation. This is especially bad for people who have limited time in Budapest.I recommend that travelers go a day early to reserve tickets preferably with their EU ID if possible then show up 15 minutes in advance to their scheduled tour the next day. If tickets in your language are sold out ask for another language. You'll still be able to see everything even if the tour guide is speaking a language that you don't understand. :P"

However, people kept coming to the front of the line and being waved through by the guard. I assume they were private tour guides as they seemed to have groups with them. It was annoying to be waiting in the cold and then have people waltz up go straight in. After purchasing our tickets waited 2 hours for our tour time.

Also - come about a half an hour before your scheduled time because you have to wait until the guard allows you to get to the ticket office to buy your tickets ( even though ordered in advance ). The whole process is not too efficient and you must be alert to make sure you have enough time to pay for the tickets."

It is an interesting bldg. and you get to see the crown surrounded by guards and the old-time window ledge cigar holders. Should take approx. one hour and the interior is very photogenic. Airport-like security before you enter so be prepared, plus if the Parliament is in session additional limitations probably will apply so check in advance. Also, if you have to wait for the next tour, there is not much to do/see/eat in the immediate area. You might get a bite at Szalai Cukraszda patisserie just north of the bldg. complex and then wait in the square near the 1956 memorial to the uprising and people watch."

However, we had to stand in line for about an hour to find out that all the English tours for that day were sold out and you couldn't buy a tour for the next day. We ended up going on an Italian tour and even that involved leaving and coming back about four hours later. I would recommend doing this as part of commercial day tour. They will already have the tickets and work your tour of the building into the tour's itinerary. You probably also save some money going with a tour company, these tours are by bus and normally have 20 or 30 tourists. You will see the rest of city in addition to the Parliament building."

The building itself was based on Englands Houses of Parliament, and is one of the top four biggest parliament buildings in the world. After the security checks, we were led up the red carpetted staircase, and in to the room with the monarchs crown in it, protected by two guards. We then entered the Old house of lords... there are two identical House of Lords rooms, the one we saw was the one which is not used. The guide described the setup of the house, and where everyone sat, and how many of each party there were. Luckily I have visited the House of Comons at the Houses of Parliament in London when they were in session, so I knew how it worked. I found the tour very interesting, and well worth getting up early for. The guide answered any questions we had, and then led us out through the exit... it was a very short tour... but it gives you a small understanding of how parliament works. The building from the outside looks wonderful... both from the Buda side of the water, and from the Pest side."

Also, the royal crown is on display in the dome room. You can take pictures of it, but without flash.I just wanted to warn future visitors about the misleading signs outside the building. The sign for ticket buyers looks like it was supposed to have a panel that could be flipped up and down to indicate when tickets were sold out for the day. That panel is missing, and so it says something like \"There are no more tickets available for today\", or words to that effect. Upon seeing that on a Wednesday afternoon, we turned around disappointed. We came back the following day at 8:00am when the ticket office opened, and saw the same sign. We knew that there was no way they could have been sold out so early, so we just waited in line and got our tickets.

I know that if you are an EU citizen you can get tickets, but the receptionist at the hotel told me I might not get in cos of the elections. So I coughed up 4000 florints to go on an official tour with one of the local agencies. What a total rip off. It lasted 90 minutes, with over 45 stood outside freezing in the cold as she narrated facts that would have been in the guidebooks. And i read the guidebooks.The inside of the Parliament building is beautiful, and well worth a look around. But pop along to the ticket office and go off your own steam."

Guided tours are offered in many languages (free for EU-citizens), but the tickets are limited, so make sure you book a place in advance in the high season (I emailed them my request a week ahead our visit and received the confirmation in 30 minutes). Our guide was very well-informed, besides the facts shared some interesting stories. The tour, which takes about 50 minutes, is a MUST when visiting this city."

I took the tour, as it wasn't worth the chance of not being able to get in. Getting in without a tour seems to be difficult at best. The process seems a bit shady but it's worth teh tour.Like the Hungary State Opera, this building could be cleaned. It looks like they began cleaning it, and then decided to stop. It would be more magnificent clean."

To begin with get there early, queues can be long and it isn't a case of nipping in and grabbing a ticket...you are let through in two's by an armed guard to get your tickets. So get there early, and don't forget your passport as if you are in an EU country you get in for free!The tour is quite lacklustre, our tour guide was almost silent and as you either follow or are followed by a tour in Hungarian it makes it very difficult to hear. You are taken to the grand staircase, the crown jewels and the main chamber then it's cut rather abruptly short. You see a tiny fraction of the complex, all in all you spend more time queuing to get in and getting through security then actually seeing the building which is tremendously opulent.There are better places to see in Budapest."

On a recent visit to Budapest my family & i queued for approx 20 mins in the heat outside the Parliament building then discovered when reaching the ticket office that holders of EU passports could visit the place for free. Since we weren't carrying ours with us we had to return to the hotel & then queue up again.However when we did join a tour it was worth it as it is a very opulent building."

I took a couple great pictures from a boat tour of this building and also got a couple great \"across the danube\" pictures from the Fishermans Bastion. When i went here as a child in 1986, i remember Parliament wasn't in session and I even got to go up to the lecturn to act like I was speaking. The outside spires are gorgeous and this is not a place to be missed on your trip to Hungary. Structures like this are why people refer to Budapest as the Paris of eastern europe."

You have to wait in line to get to buy a ticket. Posted times you can go change. Dont rely on tour book or their sign. Ticket agent was rude. And then had to wait 3 hours b4 next tour. Guide did not speak great English."

I arrived at the Parliament building at 9:30am and queued for about 30 minutes before being able to get my ticket for the 2pm tour. The tour is free for EU citizens (if you show your passport).On the guided tour, the tour guide explained that the building is modelled on Westminster. The tour lasted about 45 minutes and the guide explained everything quite well but we only saw a small part of the parliament complex so I was a bit disappointed."

            "review": "Worth seeing..but only if you book in advance!. Stunning building on the Danube! Definately worth seeing, but beware of the incredibly long lines into the place. And the line does NOT move fast at all as they only allow a certain amount of people into the building at the time. I strongly urge you to book an appointment in advance for a tour! You can skip the entire line and show your reservation to the guard. The tour is only about 30-40 minutes long and you will learn a lot in a short amount of time about the history of the building. The Parliament is really strikingly beautiful so don't miss this during your trip....but make sure you book in advance!"

It was a non trivial exercise to get into the Parliament such is the interest from tourists and locals to view this magnificent building.There are hordes of tourists around the entrance so if you want to get in be there early, otherwise you will not get in.The guide explained everything in detail and we enjoyed our tour.The only downside is the real exercise involved to actually get in.For one the tickets are expensive but worth every penny.However, I am more concerned about the lack of organization to let visitors to see the building, in an intelligent and organized manner.Definitely one of the top attractions in Budapest, but you must listen to the guide to understand the history of the building and the country."

            "review": "Worth seeing. We have just been to Budapest for a few days and one of the sights we wanted to see was Parliament.First I will give you an idea of the process to get into the building:you can only approach one gate, gate 10 (X in Roman numerals), where the ticket office is. The rest of the building (even the outside) is off limits and guarded.Ensure you go early in the morning (they are open from 8am) to get your tickets for English-speaking tours that day. As you can imagine the English-speaking tour is the most popular tour so they tend to run out of tickets very quickly. Also availability of tours is based on whether parliament is in session. They can cancel tours at the last minute.There are 3 English-speaking tours a day: at 10am, 12 noon and 2pm. You can only get tickets for THAT DAY so if you are not successful one day, you have to come back the next day. They don't allow you to reserve tickets for tours in advance. The tour itself is about 40 minutes. Once inside you get to see the entrance hall (used for special guests like royalty and heads of state) and you're led up the stairs. There are 8 solid granite columns along this flight of stairs which were a gift from the government of Sweden. You'll notice there is a lot of gold decoration and pomp, and one of the main claims to fame is that the building is the 3rd largest in the world (after Romania and Argentina). The royal crown which is centuries old is stored in the centre of the building. You can see it and take photos but not with flash. Then you get to see the chambers of the House of Lords which is no longer in use, but is identical to the House of Commons so shows you what the chambers look like. You'll get a few minutes to take photos here. An amusing observation: in the corridors outside the chamber there are gold-plated sigar holders with numbers on them; this is where (when they were still allowed to smoke), parliament members used to leave their cigars to go into meetings, and be able to identify which one was theirs when they came out!All in all a sight worth seeing, if only to say you've been there!"
