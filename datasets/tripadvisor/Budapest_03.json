We were able to play on every machine without waiting in a line.They even have very old machines and a variaty of other games. Plenty of pinball machines to play a nice game on.Only thing that bothered us after a while of playing was all the noise, because all machines make sounds and play music it became kinda intense after 1.5 hour."

We had a great time in here, spent a good couple of hours playing in 4 rooms filled with every kind of pinball machine imaginable.We found it not so busy on a Wednesday evening so that means we could get around to playing all of the machines without waiting around, but still had a pleasant atmosphere. A great place to visit being a fan of Pinball or not and very cheap entry makes it well worth it."

Even so as we descended into a dark cauldron of flashing lights and intense noise of adolescents screaming I mentally apologised to my three companions doubting we'd last 5 minutes. Two hours later they dragged me kicking and screaming out of the place. \"Can't I play just one more game? I'm trying to beat my record.\"And that's my big tip. If you go here in anymore than a group of one you'll disagree on how much time you want to spend there. [so work out a plan beforehand]. I could easily have stayed until closing, some 6 hours later. 150+ different machines and not all pinball. You can take a break for a beer and return whenever you like. A huge part of the fun is the time it takes you to work out how each machine works and the just keep improving your score.And if you're over 62 [I just missed out] you enjoy a half price discount."

This little pearl in the middle of Budapest might have gone unnoticed, if not for the awesome reviews it gets, and rightly so!The idea is simple: pay a small entrance fee, and enter a world of endless fun mashing a couple of paddles for the instant gratification of hundreds of blinking lights. What else do you need?The wide selection of games, the awesome atmosphere and the nostalgic blast from the past feeling you get a second after entering the first of 4 halls, all left me speechless and aching for more, more, MORE!I nearly cancelled my flight back home just to keep going at these machines.A must visit for everyone!"

Once I'd marvelled at what it must take to upkeep these machines, some dating from the 1930's, fun started to take over and you then want to play on as many of the pinball games as you can. Fortunately there is no rush as you pay an entrance fee of about \u00a36-\u00a37 which allows you to come in and out as you please for the day. Also a juice type bar on site. Great fun for the kids as well as the big kids"

There are SO many pinball machines - and they all have information about when they were created (year, inventors, etc.). It was interesting to see how the games evolved from the 1940's to today.Once you buy an admission ticket, you get a wristband and can play all the games for no charge. There are a few rooms so you aren't too crowded but the machines are right next to each other. There are also a few non-pinball games (regular video games).For something different to do, I would highly recommend this place! It's something I'll remember about Budapest!"

About 50 or so pinball machines as well as loads of retro 80's arcade games. One thing to bear in mind is that it doesnt open until late afternoon most days - we went there midday and found it to be closed so had to come back a few hours later.

You pay an entrance fee and can then come and go as you please throughout the day. The museum offers a variety of old school machines, ranging from The Who's Tommy and Q-Bert to some more modern varieties like South Park and Family Guy. Some other arcade favorites such as Space Invaders and MK are also available. It's easy to lose the day spending time here, so one should be aware of that before entering. Can't recommend more highly."

Like previously stated this is less a museum & more a huge pinball hall with 200 plus? Pinball machines from the 70's & 80's including classics such as Terminator, Last Acton Hero, (my favourite) and The Simpsons. Pay one price on the door & you can play as many machines, as many times as you like,for as long as you like, great concept. I can't remember how much I paid to get in (it wasn't much) so I really found this value for money & great fun! Stay for a few hours, only reason I left (reluctantly) was because it was 30 degrees plus outside & I had lots to do on my itinerary still, otherwise I could have stayed here all day! But do check the opening times before you go as normal hours are from 16:00 to 00:00 but on Sunday was open from 10:00 till 16:00 so worth checking, plus only a 5 minute walk from a nearby metro station. Personally I'd say it is best to go in the evening or on a rainy day as it was getting pretty hot in there, but an absolute must if you are in Budapest!"

It was just a few euros each, and well worth it. The one odd thing was being able to play continuously...if you played pinball as a kid part of the excitement was that you had to win extra games through points or luck (or both). We spent an hour or so, and if it hadn't been so hot 9and if my fingers weren't cramping up) would have stayed more."

There are some really old basic ones that show what folk would have played in the past, and more modern ones that are just mad.Some of the machines are pretty old and over used, so you have to be quite patient as those ones can be a little slow. When we went some of the machines were broken too, but there were still plenty of others to play with, so it was no problem at all.

There will be a museum about history, about arts in every country, but rarely games, let alone pinball.In the museum there is a variety of games, mainly pinball but also some table football and shooting games etc.. For pinball machines are set in different themes and hence different layout.The reason to deduct a point was that quite a number of machines are broken or not functioning well. For example, there is a table football game where you can control 8 players individually up and down the pitch to kick the ball. Sadly a number of figures in the table were broken. Some other controls were sluggish due to mechanical problems. Would be perfect otherwise."

We spent 2 hours in here and had a great time.Mainly pinball machines but also classics like Space Invaders etc.Machines range from 1930s to modern day (1990s).All usage is included in the entry fee.Highly recommended if you have a couple of hours to spare."

You pay a reasonable flat fee (\u20ac8 fpr adults when I went), get a wristband, and play over 100 machines spanning at least 5 decades for no additional fee. Place is in a basement with a lot of character, arched brickwork, themed decorations. It was a lot of fun, and I got to play machines I hadn't seen since I was a kid. Bring cash for admittance, snacks, and the colurful souvenir tshirts (couple of banks with cash machines just a short walk). Attendant was friendly and helpful. A must do if you have a pinball fan with you."

            "review": "Brilliant fun for a great price. I've not played many pinball machines in my life, mostly because in the UK they charge you a pound a time and that's just daylight robbery. So the idea of paying a single entrance fee and in return getting limitless goes on all of the machines sounded too good to be true.Actually, it was even better: this place is HUGE! I got distracted by the first room of machines and thought that was good enough, but after going around and playing all of them (some of them multiple times), we wandered into the next room and discovered about 50 more pinball machines plus even more rooms with other old arcade games. It's amazing how good you can get when you can just keep playing until you get that one monster that's continually trying to evade you.Most of the machines had details on top of them giving date and country of manufacture, but it's perhaps a bit of a stretch to call it a \"museum\" - although that is a very minor quibble. And honestly who doesn't like an interactive collection anyway?! It's the best kind! They even had a few pieces from the very beginning of arcade games, including a shooting game from the 1920s and an early pinball from the 1950s which could actually still be played (it seemed remarkably lethargic after the fast-paced flashing-light versions from the 90s, but was awfully quaint and conjured up a simpler time...) I also liked how they had bagatelle boards, both at eye-level and hung on the walls. I used to play bagatelle with my grandmother but it wasn't really until I saw the very old pinball machines that I realised the similarity between the two and made the connection that bagatelle must have inspired pinball. At that point I rather wished that there had been some actual information boards, as in a \"normal\" museum, to further detail the crossover and perhaps give background on the first automated machine . . . but perhaps I'm being overly enthusiastic. I'm probably the only person who's ever visited this place hoping to genuinely learn the history of arcade games!!We spent about an hour and a half in here - the time honestly flew by, I thought we'd only been inside for 20 minutes - which was probably enough. After a while even free pinball gets a bit wearying. Still I imagine that it'd be a great place for kids. Beware that if you're at all obsessive then you might be in there for considerably longer than you'd planned!!!"

Really family friendly but please respect the machines not to let kids break or misuse any of the especially older machines by having an eye to your children's gaming. Some of them might break easily.It is important to keep pinball enthusiasm alive by introducing these wonderful pieces of art to your offsprings as well. Flippermuzeum is definately their part by having a Super Mario Bros pinball available for the smaller guests and light portable \"toilet podiums\" made of plastic available for the kids to enable them to reach and see the game fields. They also have a nice cozy little soda bar there.Don't forget to support the muzeum by investing 2500 HUF to the coolest short sleeve tee or 4000 to a long sleeve version. In addition to a greatest souvenir you'll get a free refridgerator magnet if you have been playing nicely and showing respect to the machines ;) ask for a flyer two to be left to your accommodation to tell about this wonderful place to the other travellers as well.Definately worth a visit even if you are not an enthusiast like me and my 4 year old son. Please book one hour more than you originally planned for, at least two hours in total as the time flies in a place like this!"

It is in a not so touristy but easily reachable area. I got to play my favorite pinball game (Addams Family) many times which made me really happy!!"

Well we ended up being there for nearly 2 hours. It was great playing all the old pinballs but the highligtht was all the old football machines. They brought back great memories and i was still as bad as i used to be ! On the pinball front, nearly every macine was working perfectly and had no problem with tilts. Its on entrance fee for everything but remember to hang your coat up as you go in...it can get a bit warm especially if you get into one of the machines. tricky to stop playing until you have beaten your personal best! We took the 15 bus which dropped us almost outside the door, then walked back a couple of blocks to catch the 4 tram to a restaurant over on the Buda side. Great place, highly recommended"

For a small entrance fee you have access to over 130 pinball machines, all of which are in great condition, well-maintained and ready to play. There was such a variety of machines from different manufacturers, and they were displayed chronologically, with machines from as far back as the 1930s! My favourites all seemed to be from the 80s and 90s, but I tried to play a selection from each decade, as I'd never had the chance to play such vintage machines before. There is also a cafe bar there where you can get refreshments. The staff were really friendly and helpful, and you can tell that museum is a labour of love. I only wish I had more time there to play! Will definitely visit again."

You then walk down into the series of cellars which are decorated brightly and when we went around 9pm on a Wednesday it was quite busy with a party in one of the back rooms. It therefore feels cosy, enjoyable and companionable, as everyone moves between the free pinball museums. We rediscovered some childhood games. There are a few alternative machines similar to table football which were cool, and a few historical games from the 1930s which were also cool. Very reasonably priced, and has a bar."

At first glance it looked like we'd walked into an Aladdin's cave of gaming. We were excited to try all the machines and have some fun. What I hadn't realised however was that around 50% of the games just didn't work. Pretty disappointing really! Having said that we stayed around an 45 minutes and did have fun, it just wasn't anything amazing for us. If you're a super fan you'll love this place, but for the average tourist there are much better ways to spend your time in Budapest- save this for a rainy day!"

It is undoubtedly off the beaten track but you can take the metro to one of two equidistant stops then it's about fifteen minutes walking. You can check your coats as part of the entrance fee. The noise inside is like being in Vegas with all the machines going off at different times but it's such fun. Each machine is set to free play and its history Is displayed on a board on top. They go way back to the fifties and even earlier so it is a real trip down memory lane for all ages - and all ages were represented when we were there. The tables are spaced enough to play side by side but packed into combed underground cellars making the whole network of caves glow with the warm, bright, colourful lights. It is spotlessly clean and there's a little bar area to have refreshments or just a seat. Toilets are clean too. Highly recommend for pinball fans and their families/spouses who don't even realise yet how much they will enjoy it."

If you are over 62 then admission is half price, and if of that vintage like us you probably played pinballs is your younger days. The museum has a very large selections of machines from the 1940's types through to current times. All the machines are set to free play and you can stay as long as you like playing them, there are soft drink refreshments you can buy if you have time. The owner is happy to talk about his machines, many are classics which he has renovated. The place is not to far from the Parliament building heading towards the train station but a map is needed to find it. If your into Pinball machines or just want a nostalgia trip then this is the place for a great couple of hours and its not expensive. Its a great contrast to the traditional museum visit."

The place is a little hard to find, especially in the dark, but since we had the address, and I knew what I was looking for, it wasn't too bad. They had a blast! Our boys are 8 and 6, and even my 66 year old mother had a great time. They have machines that date way back to the 1930's, and once my mom found one from her birth year (1949), she was hooked. The boys easily spent a good 2 hours playing and I had to drag them out of the place. We are going back to Budapest at the end of this month and this is definitely on our list of places to revisit!"

Anyway,within minutes of entering we had no bed to worry. They loved it. So did we. My son even bought a mento t- shirt. It was great. Loads of machines (some in need of repair)but around 150 working and another 30 odd old games, like Space Invaders. Staff are friendly too. I would recommend a visit. So would my kids."

For an entry fee of 2,500 HUF you can play a wide variety of well maintained pinball machines, and a few other video games. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, and there is a refreshments bar as well. The cashier attendant was gracious and you can store your coat safely behind the counter if you wish. The only reason I did not give this an \"Excellent\" rating is that the back room is a bit crowded and tight, and it would be even better with a few additional vintage video games."

I grew up finding deposit bottles to return to the shop in order to feed the one and only pinball machine in town, often walking several miles with a frend, carrying a crate of bottles to feed our habit. We did get very good at playing pinball, and attempted the world record for non stop playing in the school holidays one year. To me this place was a serious gem and there were lots of familar machines that had emptied my change pockets over the years. There were some very interesting games from the fifties and sixties that are in great condition and really help tell the story of pinball. I spent about five hours there and only left because my wrists were aching. Some of the machines are serious museum pieces and it's a real wake up to be reminded of how old most of the games are. If you've ever played the silver ball you have to drop in here. Fantastic value for money and all sorts of games to enjoy."

They have I guess around 2-300 pinball machine and also a bunch of old video games.Having grown up in the 80's and 90's myself this was a real blast from the past (almost any old pinball you can think of is represented here, guns n roses, kiss, new and old Simpsons, Indiana jones etc.) they also have a lot of really old ones from the 20's 30's 40's and onwards. It's kind neat to think your playing on a machine that is still working that your grandfather or great grandfather might have played when they were kids.For the kids they even have small step chairs so they can also see and play. For my 4 year old he absolutely loved it, although it might have been the first pinball machines he ever played on.The format is great you pay an entry fee and then have unlimited access to the games for that day. All of the games are in free play mode. The whole place is an old basement with brick walls etc, but real good fun. They had a snack bar but to be honest we didn't try it.They open at 16:00 on mon-Friday and stay open until late. Weekends seems like they have additional hours. Would be nice if they were open during the day mon-fri but I guess the turnout might be lower then.Either way will definitely come back next I am in Budapest!!"

We didn't have IPADS and smart phones. The only drawback was that I arrived at 3pm and didn't realize it didn't open till 4pm. It is a hole in the wall and the ONLY reason to gothere is to play pinball. I tried 6-7 games and finally found one that was really old that was simple to understand how to rack up points and I played it for over an hour. Simple fun."

It is open fron 4pm until midnight most days. Entrance fee is 2500forints (\u00a35.56 - bargain) and You have to pay in cash. On entry you are given a wrist band and this entitles you to come in and out until midnight. There are a hundred and eighty pinball machines in the museum and your entrance fee means you can play on all of them all night long. My husband and I arrived at 6pm and before we knew it the time was 22.00! We had a great time. The machines are all set to free play so you can try them all or just concentrate on a few to improve your skill. It took us both back to our youth and was a great way to spend an evening at such a cheap price."

Pinball is fun and after a while you'll find a machine you really like and before you know it you're hooked and an hour has passed! There are machines from the early 1900s here and from every decade up to now. You don't appreciate how popular pinball has been throughout modern times but it is displayed here in all its neon glory.

The museum is filled with pinball machines, and each and one of them comes interesting facts about model/number of machines produced/year .............some are nearly as old as Queen Elizabeth.. :) Once you pay the entrance fee, which is around \u00a35, you don't have to worry about inserting coins into the machines as games are free.

Always wanted to play the Kiss and Creature from the Black Lagoon machines so one very happy lady indeed! Just be aware it's open from Wednesday onwards. It's been a while since I played so managed to rattle my way through about 40 machines in 90 mins haha. Would have spent a fortune in a normal arcade!"

It's a must for any fan of games and/ or amusements.I went in there expecting it to be just a few pinball machines lying around but it was so much more than that. The pinball museum comprises of a whole range of pinball machines - there must be a couple of hundred of them - from basic 1930s incarnations (with no flippers) right up to more modern day machines, and everything in between. All the classics are there such as 'Ripley's Believe it or Not' and 'Arabian Nights.' Other great tables are 'Star Wars Episode I' (mush more enjoyable than watching the film!) and the Simpsons table. Each exhibit in the museum (i.e. each pinball machine) has a little info card on it stating the year of manufacture, the manufacturer and the designer for that bit of extra info, and each is set to Free Play so you can stay and play on each machine as many times as you want.You pay an entrance fee to get in (500 HUF) and a 2000 HUF deposit, so around \u00a36 in total. For every 15 minutes you stay there, an amount is deducted from the deposit, until the entire deposit is gone. So if you leave after an hour, you get around 1200 HUF back. Although I can't imagine many people leave in time get get any money back, it's far too addictive :-) Once you've gone past your allotted time and used up all of your deposit, you can stay in the place until it closes, and can even go out for food and come back in, as they give you a wrist band on entry.As well as the pinball machines, there are some retro arcade machines such as the original Space Invaders, and some old school amusements such as machines with BB guns to aim at targets.The museum itself is in the basement of a really cool building and has a great atmosphere. There were quite a few people in there when we were in, and the noise of pinballs, arcade machines and people having fun added to the atmosphere. 4 hours flew by, and we only dragged ourselves away because we had to get to the airport for our final hotel check in. If you go, be prepared to give up an entire day to this place!"

We went to the Pinball Museum not really knowing what to expect - the next hour and a half flew by and was one of the highlights of our trip. Neither of us are arcade enthusiasts but it would be impossible not to become completely immersed in the huge variety of games the museum has to offer. On arrival you pay an flat entry fee (HUF500) and an additional cost of HUF2000 to use the machines. Use of the machines is charged at HUF200 for every 15mins and you'll be partially refunded from the HUF2000 at the end of the trip based on the length of your visit (and provided you didn't spend over 2.5 hours there!).Even if you're not a massive fan of pinball, don't be put off by the name - there are plenty of other machines, including classic electronic arcade games (Space Invaders, Mortal Kombat), old school shoot 'em ups and mechanical games that date back to the 1930's. I defy anyone to visit this place and not have a brilliant time - there's something for everyone to enjoy!"

You have to play more than 2.25 hours not to get any money back, but at that point, you'd happily pay them again!

However I can't help but recommend this for quirky, unusual and very enjoyable fun... This place does what it says it should... I do think they could really take this to the next level by adding a wider range of old classic arcade games, maybe do a proper cafe to add to it...

It was 2500 HUF entry but if you do not stay for two or more hours you get a partial refund plus I hasten to add that for this price you get FREE play of all the machines!! That's aprox \u00a36 p/p well worth it and a great way to spend a couple of hours winding down after walking around and taking in the sights."

Above each one there is a plague explaining when it was made, by whom, where and how many copies. Went there with my husband and was prepared to be so bored as I am not fan of things like this, but I was converted when inside. It is addictive and what a great fun! Not every day you can play on something which was made in 1830! It is not the easiest place to find as even receptionist from our hotel didn't know about it and she lives on the same street, but it is close to Western Railway Station and West End Shopping Centre. Don't miss it when in Budapest and I can guarantee that you will have a great time!"

A really fun and nice place.This place is both museum and \"playground\" for pinball fans.For a really good price (2500HUF - 16:00-24:00) you can try all the games (all of them in the \"free play\" mode)And the guys working there are really friendly and keeps the games in a very nice condition.The place and the mashines are really clean.You can feel, that these people put great time and effort to make it NOT like a business, but a place to share their love and interest about pinball :)So go ahead and spend a couple of hours at this place, you wont be disappointed. :)"

You pay a very small entrance price and get unlimited goes on literally hundreds of pin ball machines. There are some very old ones and also a few other old arcade games. We ended up staying for close to three hours!"

Its cheap to get in though i was entirely confused about the entrance fee. Something along the lines of you pay 2000ft to enter and if you leave before the next entry quarter starts then you get your money back. If you decide not to leave then you can stay until around midnight playing pinball for free.There are a few other arcades too....space-invaders. pac-man, street fighter and some awesome bowling, basketball and shooting games from the 60's that are awesome.They did have a cafe but unfortunately it wasn't open at the time. Would be great to have a snack and drink break in between playing.Seriously though, great place which you should try and visit."

We particularly liked the bowling putt game! They do a great deal where you pay and get a wrist band, so you can come and go as you please until 12am. The guy running the place was very friendly - What a great place! - A must see!"

Kids are welcome when accompanied by their parents. I live in Budapest and keep going back with an increasing amount of friends being into the place. Go, play, enjoy!"

Pball Galery has just opened its doors in 2014 and become the biggest Pinball (open)collection all over Europe. After paying some Hungarian Forints (approx 8-9 EUR) you can play unlimited free games on all machines... There are more than 130 pinballs, and of course the biggest names are included, like Indiana Jones, Addams Family or Arabian Nights. If you want some unique experience You can find also some really old games (also in playable condition) and some specialities from the middle of the 20 century.I suggest this place not only for families, but also for party, or just having some fun alone, too...."

All of them are functional and unlimited play is included in the modest admission price.
