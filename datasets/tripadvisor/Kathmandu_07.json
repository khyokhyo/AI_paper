Not a big user of Trip Advisor usually but thought the service I received was so good thought I would make an exception.In Kathmandu Pradip's communication was great prior to the trek. He even booked a subsequent flight for me that was unrelated to the trek. Once we were in the mountains Ngima and his team were patient, professional and above all encouraging when conditions got tougher. Unfortunately I didn't make it to the summit due to 9 hours of snow the night before our final attempt but this was obviously out of MM's control. All equipment was of a high standard and at no time did we feel any corners were being cut. To sum up: a very professional company with a nice personal touch!"

            "review": "Mera Peak Trek . We just finished the mera peak trek with mountain monarch and it was simply awesome! Everything was well organised , well planned and well executed from the moment we met in the hotel in Kathmandu. We wanted to spend our money with a local company and mountain monarch went beyond our expectations ... The guides were excellent and the kitchen was amazing .... The amount of top quality food given to us under some very tough conditions was truly impressive and of course the porters behind the scenes lugging our gear up and down the mountains ... Everyone was very professional and because they all know each other and the locals in the tea houses along the way , the whole expedition went so smoothly and it's all done without any fuss and done with a lot of laughter and enjoyment by all of us!! The whole group summited and made it back down safe ... We can't thank mountain monarch and the team enough for a truly remarkable life experience ... We will use them again next time and highly recommend them to anyone planning a trek or mountain mission in Nepal!Thanks againRhys and Franziska"

This company paid attention to every detail....\"no problem\". As a solo female traveling, I had all the confidence during this trek that Dawa, Netra, and Mingma would keep me safe and at the same time ensure that I enjoyed even the most challenging parts of the trek. They taught us about the culture and pointed out interesting facts along the way. We sang :) The quality equipment provided and the tea houses selected made for great comfort at the end of one day with a meeting about how we feel ( with pulse oximetry checks) and about what to expect on the next day. Along the journey we witnessed other trekking companies and we all were grateful for choosing Mountain Monarchs."

We had 5 members on our team, including a 70-year old man, and we had a 100% success rate of reaching Base Camp because of how amazing the Mountain Monarch guides were. From the warm welcome at the airport in Kathmandu to the dancing departure dinner in Lukla, and all the priceless memories in between- the guides and admin staff were absolutely wonderful to work with. I was impressed by the standard of organization and overall service provided, and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a positive and memorable once in a lifetime experience. The guides (Finjo & Mingma are the best!) were incredibly knowledgeable about the region, history and culture of Nepal and the Himalaya, and went out of their way to share the beauty of their homeland with us at each stop. Their knowledability made the experience exponentially better than if I had gone only knowing what I read online- they are locals after all! The team from the Mountain Monarchs tour know the best tea houses to stay in, and you can guarantee excellent food choices and sleeping amenities. Our tea houses were always very comfortable and friendly...a welcome sight after long days of walking :) Our wonderful (and STRONG) porters had our bags conveniently waiting for us at each tea house so that we could quickly change out of our boots at the end of the day. (P.s.I personally could not have completed this journey without our porters and I am very grateful!)The trip allowed for flexibility in the schedule (we wanted an extra day in Kathmandu and the team was very helpful in organizing this) and extremely well equipped for saftey. I had never been at altitude before so I was really nervous about experiencing AMS, but we had our blood oxygen and pressure checked regularly to ensure our bodies were coping with altitude. There was even an oxygen tank available if we felt that we needed it- at one point our guide even helped a trekker from another group so we knew we were in the best hands in the mountains. This trip to Mt Everest Base Camp was unbelievable and I thank Mountain Monarch for helping me achieve a lifetime goal. Again, I would HIGHLY recommend this tour group to anyone looking for an organized, fun, knowledgeable and high quality tour to the Himalayan region. I can't wait until my next trip :) Any questions please feel free to ask! "

Namasteeeeeee!Throughout the trip all members of the mountain monarch team were extremely helpful and friendly always going the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed, we were always kept informed of plans and the next day\u2019s agenda a truly very professional company. The route we took for acclimatisation was planned out perfectly, which I believe helped us in summiting massively, as altitude is the main reason that people don\u2019t summit Mera. If I went back to Nepal trekking again would I choose Mountain Monarch? The answer is most definitely yes!! So thank you once again to everyone that who made it happen.Tom"

I was part of a group of 4 that did Everest Base Camp in October 2016 \u2013 Father/daughter and Wife/Husband \u2013 we added an extra day spending 13 days instead of 12.Mountain Monarch exceeded all of my expectations \u2013 They established a solid itinerary and then adapted as necessary due to conditions and/or so that we could experience more of rural Nepal. Interestingly, prior to the trip we were trying to follow the local weather forecasts from here in North America \u2013 it looked like it was raining every day \u2013 not the case \u2013 the weather forecasts are not correct for the area. Weather was clear for the first 5-6 days then clouded over for the remainder - we had about 90 minutes of drizzle during the trek.On Day 5, one of our party started to feel the effects of altitude sickness, they started taking Diamox to no avail \u2013 at Lobuche the Wife/Husband had to head to lower altitude. Dipen, our guide was masterful in managingthe situation as it occurred and in escorting the two of them back down to lower altitude safely. At the same time, our assistant guide Santos stepped up and became the guide for my Daughter and I to continue on. We made it to Gorek Shep, did Base Camp that afternoon. The next day, Santos awoke me at 4:30 AM, we started climbing Kala Patar \u2013 by 5:30 it was obvious it was completely clouded over. We discussed heading back down, I actually started walking down \u2013 Santos convinced me to walk up further \u2013 we went up \u2026 still cloudy, started down \u2013 then a clearing, could just see the outline of one slope of Everest. We went back up further and at 7 AM Everest broke through. Without Santos' 'encouragement', I wouldn\u2019t have got to see Everest.Everyone does well when things are going well \u2013 character is how you respond when things aren\u2019t going well - Dipen and Santos showed an awful lot of character. These two gentlemen did an amazing job. Dipen's knowledge of the area, religions, and customs was enlightening. Santos' sense of humor, smile and laugh lit up many rooms along the way. They made a good experience great!I commend Mountain Monarch on the 1 trekker 1 porter policy - this addresses a real problem in the area. At first I was amazed at the physical feats of strength and agility the porters displayed - when a couple of random porters removed their shirts one warm day I was horrified at the bruising on their backs - the 1 trekker 1 porter policy at Mountain Monarchs is well worth supporting, the other porters are carrying too much - to a point of being unhealthy/dangerous."

            "review": "Unforgettable teahouse trek of Annapurna circuit. We would like to thank Mountain Monarch team for organizing memorable Annapurna circuit trek for us (Sep \u2013 Oct, 2016). We did a fair bit of research before deciding on the trek and booking with Mountain Monarch and we are very happy with our choice! At the outset, their website was very helpful and provided good information on various treks. Subsequently, Mr. Pradip was quick to respond to our queries on email and phone, and these discussions helped us plan well for the trip, sitting far away from Nepal!Once in Nepal, we met our guide Arjun and our porters, and pretty much relied on them for the next few weeks during our hike. What we liked the most about Arjun and other Mountain Monarch guides we met en route was the professionalism, knowledge (of local conditions + medical), and friendliness. Arjun was well equipped with a good medical kit and knowledge of what conditions to look for in customers. Arjun was also extremely thorough in his daily briefings and flexible to adapt to our constraints and interests.We could also see Arjun and other guides constantly communicate on trail conditions, and update each other. We felt safe with that kind of meticulous planning. We were also impressed with the policy of \u201cOne porter for one customer\u201d, and we could see our porters were taken better care of by their management than that of porters from other companies.As we did a teahouse trek, we were reliant on Mountain Monarch for having a good local network to get us the better teahouse for stay or lunches, at the villages where it got crowded, and they did indeed met or exceed our expectations.As a result, we had very less to worry in terms of logistics, trail difficulty etc. and could just free our mind to enjoy a beautiful trekking experience, and the spectacular views. Staring from 800 m to crossing the Thorong La pass at 5,400 m, and climbing down to Muktinath at 3,800 m, while enjoying great views of Annapurna ranges, and diverse landscape each day, was an experience we will never forget in our life time. If we go back to Nepal for another adventure I the future, it would be with Mountain Monarch!"

This is a trek that combines the lodges of the Annapurna Circuit with some off-the-beat trekking and camping in remote areas. This is a great combination! We were with guide Vivek and four porters. Everything was very well organized, we only had to walk, eat and sleep. The gear was all in order, including very nice tents, sleeping bags and mats. The guidance was very good. For me, it was the first time I was in Nepal, and the first time at high altitude. I felt very safe and secure, the build-up was very gradual, and my health issues were dealt with expertly. Vivek was excellent company, he understood very well when it was necessary to guide actively, and when it was possible to relax and give us confidence and space. He also knew a lot about nature and culture. They were also flexible in the programme, although in general one has to say that their planning is probably best, since they know what they're doing! They're absolutely worth it!"

I really appreciated being in a small group of two as it meant that our plans were easily adapted to suit more of what we wanted along the way. CP was a wonderful guide, who really looked after us especially when my fellow trekker fell ill, as well as being hugely entertaining, friendly, caring and passionate about the trek, Nepal and life itself! Just when I thought nothing could top our day at Annapurna Base Camp (ABC), our last day during the Dashain festival was so beautiful that it caused a lump in my throat of gratitude and emotion especially when we were playing on the festival swing with the children after walking through the beautiful paddy fields with the endless variety of pretty butterflies and dragonflies.Pasun, our porter, was amazing; I just wish I could have spoken Nepalese to him! In comparison with another tour company (compared notes with another group post-trek), ours was much better organised and the service was far better and respectful with private transfers between KTM and Pokara. I definitely recommend MM and would use them again.A bit of advice: If you arrive in KTM one-two days prior to the trek, you could buy extra kit there on top of what MM provide. To remove leeches/keep leech free, get an old pop sock/part of a pair of tights, wrap up a ball of salt in it to make it a poultice to dab the leeches off. Walk in the middle of path wherever possible, staying away from vegetation and walk with a good distance between each other to avoid any leeches pinging off the branches disturbed by the person in front of you. Wear at least two socks and trousers tucked in, preferably with waterproof trousers on top and rub your legs/feet with salt.Definitely recommend hiking poles for the descent if you want to protect your knees."

            "review": "Wonderful first visit to Nepal. We travelled to Nepal for 6 days in early July; 2 adults and 2 children ages 11 and 8. I was a little anxious because it is monsoon season in July and was hoping the rains wouldn't dampen our whole trip. From our first contact, Pradip answered my many questions quickly and patiently. He customized our trip to include trekking, a jungle visit to Chitwan, a morning flight to see Mount Everest and a quick cultural tour of Kathmandu. It was a jam packed 6 day trip! Our guide for the week was Dipen Rai and we don't have enough good things to say about him! His English is excellent and local knowledge extensive. He met us at the airport and took excellent care of us for the rest of our trip. He handled all of our trip details with ease and we all enjoyed his company along the way, especially our 8-year old son.  The trekking was an easy hike from Kande up to the Australian Camp then down to Dhampus and Phedi. Each day was only a 2 hour (max) walk, very do-able with the kids. Mountain Monarch provided sleeping bags, fleece liner, down jacket and a rain poncho as well as a huge duffle bag to put all of our gear in. We were fortunate that it didn't rain while we were trekking as the stone steps and path would have been very slippery in the rain. For the trek we also had an assistant guide, Amrit and 2 porters Romesh and Dashvil. They were also great guys although they didn't speak a lot of English and we don't speak any Nepalese! My son's favourite part of the trip was playing cards with the guys after the day's trek was done:)After 3 days of trekking we drove to Chitwan. Our driver (also called Dipen) was also excellent along the crazy roads from Pokhara to Chitwan then to Kathmandu. We enjoyed seeing the rhinos in Chitwan however the long drive (5 hours from Pokhara and 7 hours to Katmandu) ate into our sightseeing time. In hindsight I think we would have rather done more trekking. On our last morning in Kathmandu we went on a flight to see Mount Everest. We were once again lucky with the weather as these flights don't run if the visibility isn't good and you don't know the visibility report until that morning. Pradip prepared us for this possibility as the flights the day before were all cancelled. At the the end of our trip we went on a quick visit to the Boudhanath Stupa and then the promised rains finally hit us so we missed seeing Pashupati temple before our flight home. Mountain Monarch's experience gave us a well-organized and enjoyable trip. The hotel in Kathmandu was a bit basic but well-located just off the main street in Thamel, the teahouses along our hike were clean and the hotels in Pokhara and Chitwan were very nice and more modern. We were very lucky with the weather as it rained a few times but not when we had to hike or sight-see. It was nice to go in the off-season as there weren't very many tourists around and hardly anyone else on the trails for our short trek. We had a wonderful experience in Nepal and it was all due to Mountain Monarch's professional care and attention to detail in planning our trip. Pradip's previous experience as a guide shows that he knows what the client wants and also how to support his guides so that they are happy. Thank you to Dipen Rai, Dipen 2 and Pradip for an excellent holiday!"

The trip was perfect as was the support and organization by MMA. My guide, C.P., was encouraging, always happy and ready to help me accomplish my goals. If you want to get the most out of your stay in Nepal, MMA is the right company for you. They cover all of the logistics so you have no worries and can concentrate on the magnificence of the mountains, the culture, and local people you encounter. MMA provides the complete package. I cannot emphasize enough how having a guide enhances the experience you will have. They have knowledge of the terrain, the view points, the various cultures and religions, the trees, birds, animals as well as keep you safe. Every detail of my trip was managed superbly by MMA. I have no reservations in recommending MMA for a five star experience."

Mountain Monarch organised everything for us from airport pick-up, accommodation in Kathmandu, flights to & from Pokhara and of course the trek itself. Everything went really smoothly.Our wonderful guide Finjo led us with great skill and his ever-present smile. He was assisted by Mingma, Navaraj and Nepal\u2019s next super chef, Pemba. We carried day packs, but our overnight bags were of course carried by \u201cthe boys\u201d: our super team of porters. Each night we had our sleeping bags, down jackets, clean clothes thanks to the efforts of these guys.Our highest elevation for sleeping was Khopra Danda at 3660m but there was also a side trip Kaier Lake at around 4500m. We had fantastic views of the Annapurna range, Machapuchare and Dhaulagiri throughout the trek and enjoyed fantastic sights and company.Thanks again Pradip and the Mountain Monarch team. These are the guys to talk to if you want to trek in Nepal.Graham"

Straight away we felt comfortable. All the activities that were organized were thought about with us in mind. They gave us options which meant we could relax or go on a tour of the city and surrounds. The treks that Mountain Monarch had planned for us were off the beaten track and were somewhat difficult in some instances. (This was what we requested) The tea houses were carefully chosen and the food was superb. The communication between Dawa Finjo Sherpa and our group each day was informative and entertaining. At no time did I feel I had not got value for money. The porters arrived before us each day and our bags were always dry and in good order. This was one of the best Treks I have been on and Mountain Monarch exceeded all my expectations. At all times I felt safe, secure and entertained by the Guides. I will definitely call Mountain Monarch to organize my family holiday in the future.Steve H"

Trekked to EBC from May 2th through May 16th.All in all a great trip, a trip of a life time.The guides (Nima & Roshun) were professional and easy going. They knew the mountain like the back of their hand and made the difficult parts of the trek manageable.For part of the trek, there were other guides with us, I just can't remember their names but they were excellent as well.The tea houses were comfortable and exceed my expectation. All were clean and the food was good.I enjoyed the one trekker, one porter policy. I hope more tour companies will follow this example in the future. Other than great reviews, It is one of the reasons I signed up with Mountain Monarch. I singed up for the \"Everest circuit trek\" but when I got to Kathmandu, I was ask if I wanted to do 2 pass, which included my initial itinerary + Renjo Pass. It was a great experience getting away from the crowds and doing 2 passes. We got some bad weather as we crossed the Chola pass so it was a bit difficult but fun at the same time. However, most of the time we got great weather and were able to enjoy the view. All in all I was extremely happy with the trek, thank you Mountain Monarch"

My boyfriend and I booked the EBC trek and from the moment we contacted Pradip we knew we\u2019d made the right choice. His quick replies, helpful answers were enough to tell us these were the guys we wanted to go with. Not to mention that it\u2019s a fantastic local business which we wanted to support and their belief in the 1 Porter to 1 Trekker system. Pradip really is doing something right \u2013 even his team share how great he is and speak so highly of him, which just makes you support what Mountain Monarch does. The trek itself was stunning from start to finish. Meeting both Pradip and our Lead Guide Aakash at the hotel put our minds at ease and answered any lingering questions. We felt so assured and safe in their hands. The welcome dinner was a lovely touch, perfect for starting to get to know your fellow trekkers and our leader. A great night! The tour in Kathmandu and visit to the burial ceremony was a fantastic experience. Our guide Ram was an absolute delight, charming, knowledgeable and very funny. We all had a wonderful time and learnt a lot.We could not believe how great the whole experience was\u2026there were luxuries we had not even expected. Plenty of hot drinks throughout the day, a fantastic choice of food in all teahouses, charging facilities everywhere, showers if you wanted, even wifi cards available to those who needed, wonderfully comfortable beds, some rooms with private bathrooms, as temperatures dropped the guys were amazing and offered us bowls of hot water in the mornings to wash our faces with \u2013 truly amazing on a chilly morning! Breakfasts and all meals were delicious and certainly enough to keep us going all day! The bathroom facilities were clean, indoors and perfectly functional, some squat loos, but we were used to them due to travelling in Asia previously so no problem at all \u2013 absolutely no complaints about anything. The teahouses were so comfortable, amazingly so \u2013 their communal areas amazing for socializing, warmed with the stoves and the owners always friendly and helpful! Our lead guide Aakash was the best guide we\u2019ve ever had on an organised trek - wonderfully passionate about what he does, a great sense of humour and hugely patient at all times. Our daily briefings were informative, thorough and detailed. We felt totally safe with him, he was incredibly knowledgeable, professional but also social and we thoroughly enjoyed getting to know him. The other assistant guides were fantastic, so attentive, patient and kind. Mingma and Roshun were with us throughout and were amazing. Other guides we also had the pleasure of spending time with were Mingma and Lakpa and of course we couldn\u2019t have done it without all of the wonderful porters.The equipment we used from Mountain Monarch was amazing \u2013 the down jackets only needed in the evenings, the sleeping bags and liners \u2013 so warm, especially with our hot bottles of water inside! The trekking itself was tough at times but the guides were fantastic at pacing us, taking us very slowly to altitude and really we felt great considering how high we went. We had done some HIIT training sessions and walking up and down stairs to train before which helped with the long days and up and down fashion of the trek. But it was absolutely beautiful - the most beautiful place i have ever been which which over-rules any difficulty on the trek. Overall Mountain Monarch Adventures were totally professional, attentive, ethical and friendly. We loved every moment of our trek and it was worth every penny. We would love to come back and do more trekking with them in future. Trekkers and guides all started as strangers but soon we were a family. Thank you for everything and for helping us get to EBC and Kala Patthar \u2013 it was a truly unforgettable experience!"

The trek was excellent: well organsied with an excellent guide and porters.I was well looked after from being met at the airport right through until my departure. personal attention from the Managing Director, Pradip, was indicative of the personal servcie provided. Nothing was too much trouble, best illustrated by the company chartering a plane to ensure we got from Kathmandu to Lukla without further delays when our original flight was cancelled because of bad weather.The trek itself lasted 21 days in total including time spent in Kathmandu. We stayed in teahouses which were better equipped and more comortable than I had expected. Food was generally good. We were lucky in that we had very good weather so the views were fantastic. The trek itself was not too hard except for the Cho La Pass itself. However this was well worth the efort. Our guide, Dipen, was excellent, very professional anjd attentive to the needs of me and the other person on the trek. he varied the itinerary to accommodate our specific needs.Mountain Monarch are to be recommended for their excellent policy of one porter per trekker. I saw groups from other, perhaps better known companies, where the porters seemd to me to be carrying excessive loads. Our porters were well equipped and properly looked after.I would have no hesitation in recommending Mountain Monarch to anyone considering trekking in Nepal."

We had actually booked the EBC (Everest Base Camp) but due to some health issue (sciatica), we felt safer to do something shorter and less strenuous (even though we are experienced trekkers). We contacted Mountain Monarch the day prior our departure asking what the options were & they recommended this Annapurna Panorama trek & also accepted that we could apply half our deposit to this trek, which we greatly appreciated. Our stay and the trek was seamlessly organized by Pradip and his team and we enjoyed very much the insights of our guide, Arjun, and our interactions with the other staff of Mountain Monarch (Ram and Ram! and Finjo). The trek itself is a good 5 day (4 nights) introductory trek, which included some nice views of Annapurna and Daulaghiri range, pleasant walking through blooming rhododendrons, nice lodges in picturesque villages (e.g. Gundruk) & insight into rural life of the Gurung people of Nepal. To be fair, we were a little disappointed with the views of the high mountain as the atmosphere turned out to be fairly misty which we read is actually fairly common at lower altitude in April-May. So we would probably recommend to do this trek and plan any trip to Pokhara between October and March instead. However, we learned that the trekkers who carried on with the EBC at the same time had very good weather and visibility up there...On the plus side, the rhododendrons were in full bloom near Ghorepani, which made for great colours and pictures, and we had more time to visit all the Unesco World Heritage sites in and around Kathmandu which are still incredible in spite of the damage caused to some of them by the earthquake of April 2015. All in all, we very much enjoyed our 12-day stay in Nepal and are definitely going back to experience the higher altitude!"

I knew after reading the reviews I had likely found our guide company. Mr. Limbu was very quick to respond to our first email inquiry and he made us feel comfortable with our plans from the start. After we confirmed the our itinerary and booked our international flight we wired a deposit to Mountain Monarch. We emailed a few times back and forth with questions which were quickly answered. When we arrived, our MM quide was at the airport to pick us up with a new clean van. He escorted us to our hotel and we settled in for the night. The 2nd day we had a wonderful tour of the local sights, then met with Mr Limbu and our guide that afternoon to get our equipment and discuss the trek. ( We were loaned a down jacket, sleeping bag, liner and rain poncho as well as a large duffel per trekker for our gear). The porters would later carry this on the trek. Our airport transfers, flights, tours, bus rides and trek all went without a hitch. We trekked for 4 days, during that time all of the accommodations and food prep was handled by our wonderful guides. The trek to Poon Hill was hard, but so so worth it in the end. Everyone you meet on the trail was wonderful from the locals to other trekkers. I had read many reviews that said, you come for the views and experience and return for the people. That sentiment is spot on. Its the people and the hospitality that makes Nepal and the treks so great. On a side note, we really expected to see more damage from the earthquake. It was there, but almost had to be pointed out in most cases with the exception of the historic/religious tour spots. In closing, let me reassure you, Nepal is safe. The people are wonderful, the experience is unlike anything else we have seen in the USA. When we return to trek to EBC, we will only be calling Mountain Monarch to handle our guide and travel arrangements. Thank you Pradip Limbu, Mingma Sherpa, Phenuru Sherpa, Ram our Kathmandu tour guide and our porters for making it such a wonderful trip. The entire staff exceeded our expectations."

A dear friend and I wanted to trek to Mount Everest, or more precisely, Kala Pattar, above Everest Base Camp, to get a close-up view of the most famous mountain in the world. After we reached Kathmandu, we allowed ourselves time to go on Trip Advisor and arrange in-person interviews with representatives and guides from the four highest-rated local trekking companies. I'm so glad we did! The other companies were great, but we picked Mountain Monarch because of its focus on safety and ethics. For example, Mountain Monarch was the only company we interviewed that insisted on bringing an oxygen tank and two sherpas for two trekkers. Rescue helicopters will not fly at night or in bad weather, but the other companies never mentioned this. The other companies never mentioned the need for oxygen if no helicopter rescue or rapid downward climb is possible. It was so comforting to always see the oxygen cylinder being carried by our side, especially when the air became so thin that every step upward had me huffing and puffing. Having two sherpas instead of one was very good for us as well as them. I don't like seeing human beings carrying the 30 kg that is standard for other companies. 15 kg is enough for any human! And because we had two happy sherpas instead of one exhausted sherpa, our sherpas would get to the next lodge in record time, and then race back to us and carry our backbacks for the rest of the way, which is often the toughest part.Our Mountain Monarch guide, Dipen Rai, was amazing. We could tell he would be, as soon as we interviewed him. His English is perfect, he's got a great personality and sense of humor, and he clearly loves his job because of his passion for the Nepal trekking experience. He took a genuine interest in us, and he was constantly coming up with ways to make us happier and safer.One thing I wanted to make clear at the start was that we wanted to customize our trek. We did not want to be rushed in any way, or be told that we had to cover any particular distance in one day. Dipen and his company did not resist this at all, and in fact, they helped us tailor the trek as we went along, taking into account that I am 100 pounds overweight and nearly 60 years old. We took it very slow! Most young, fit people take about 8 days to trek from Lukla to Kala Pattar. We took 12 days for that. And then we helicoptered back to Lukla on a flight that was 5 minutes of heaven, getting an aerial view of everywhere we had been. I'm convinced that taking it super-slow on the way up, plus the lack of panic when I knew there was an oxygen tank and mask right there at all times, are what prevented me from getting altitude sickness. Several much younger, fitter people we saw coming down as we went up were not so lucky.It was a very challenging trek, but the rewards were tremendous. The views were even more exciting that we imagined. My friend and I bonded in the best possible way, by sharing an extraordinary adventure. Yes, there were hardships along the way, but their effect was to make me feel so grateful for almost everything in my life back home, which I usually take for granted.Thank you Dipen, Pradip, and Mountain Monarch for making this a perfect trek that we will never forget!"

            "review": "Poon hill trek and Chitwan Safari. We have just returned from our first holiday to Nepal and can honestly say we loved every minute of it. We booked our Poon Hill trek/ Chitwan safari holiday through Mountain Monarch who organised everything impeccably. Pradip the owner promptly addressed every question or concern I had (which were numerous) by e-mail, during the planning of this holiday. Pradip fulfilled every request I made which enabled my husband to trek with me. This included hiring a horse to support us during our trek; this was necessary for my husband\u2019s knee problem. Pradip\u2019s expertise and attention to detail created a holiday of a life time that was stress free and which surpassed all expectations.Our guide for the trek was Finjo. He was professional and extremely knowledgeable which gave reassurance to us and we benefitted from a wealth of information about the area we trekked and culture of the communities who live in this area of the Himalaya\u2019s. Finjo supported my husband to reach the summit of poon hill for sunrise and we were all rewarded with the most increasable views of the Annapurna range in crystal clear weather conditions. Finjo created a relaxed and stress free atmosphere throughout the trek, with nothing been too much trouble. We thoroughly enjoyed spending the 7 days with Finsu, Ramesh our porter and Raj our horse driver.At every tea house Finju made sure we were able to have a hot shower (bliss!) and arranged our meals for us at the tea houses. I especially loved the Dal Bhat and the thick creamy porridge with honey and masala tea. After completely the trek we spent a couple of days in Pokhara where Finjo introduced us to Sherpa cuisine (delicious) and accompanied us on our journey to Chitwan. Our Chitwan safari was superb, we took an elephant and a jeep safari and a jungle walk. The staff at the hotel Pradip booked were extremely helpful and the hotel had resident rangers who took us on the safari\u2019s. We saw so many animals including a Tiger! This was an incredible sight and one that we never thought we would see. We also saw wild elephants, Rhino\u2019s, sloth Bear, monkeys, deer and many more. Once we returned to Kathmandu Pradip arranged a sightseeing tour. Despite the awful destruction of the recent earthquake there are so many heritage sights intact and so much of Nepal\u2019s rich cultural and historical heritage to see with 7 UNESCO world heritage sites. This has been an incredible holiday experience which has fulfilled my dream of Trekking in the Himalayas and also created more dreams to return with Mountain Monarch."

            "review": "Amazing Holiday of a Lifetime. I've travelled all over the world, but this adventure (3-centre) holiday organised by Mountain Monarch turned into trip of a lifetime. The CEO, Pradip takes personal care of each and every client, and ensured a seamless experience of whatever was desired. He welcomed us personally, and also on departure - can't say that about many other companies.My wife and I wanted to go onto Poon Hill to see the Anapurna range, visit Chitwan to see the jungle life, and see what Kathmandu had to offer by way of cultural heritage. Pradip made it happen, using his knowledge and links across Nepal - far better than anyone abroad could have done, I think. Accommodation, food and guidance was brilliant. We had a one day arrival in the capital, followed by a 6-day trek, then by 2 nights in Chitwan and 3 back in Kathmandu.My own fitness was not great, and therefore a horse was provided by the company (cost extra, but justifiably so) for the times when the climb became too much for me (3,000 steps anyone?). We had a brilliant one-on-one guide named Finzu (a Sherpa) who had climbed Everest (no less)! This modest young gentleman was attentive and caring, ensuring that we faced the physical challenges but were not overwhelmed by any cultural or communications issues. The tea houses were as expected - but do bring along slippers and a towel. The closest analogy is to think of them as youth hostels,.The company provided sleeping blankets and other items such as jacket, so you don't need to be a pro to go with them. Our porter, Ramees and the horse boy Raz made us a group of five. Apart from our own thermal clothes and a few toiletries we spent 6 days trekking - everything else was met by the company. I took along an electric shaver and found that as it wasn't drying out properly it became less effective over the trek, but did add a certain ruggedness to my appearance which I believe is currently fashionableWe stayed at the Shangri-La in Kathmandu (superb), the Choice Inn in Pokhara (fantastic), and Landmark Forest Lodge in Chitwan (brilliant) all met our high expectations.Transfers were prompt and comfortable and went without a hitch. The individual attention given by various people was amazing. The value for money due to the exchange rate made Nepal a place where $30 per day was more than adequate for food etc., but keep in mind that Mountain Monarch took responsibility for food for 7 out of 14 days for us. Be advised that drinks (apart from water) are an extra, and that it is rare to get any diet versions of soft drinks. Given the Nepali lack of a sweet tooth, obesity is not a problem here, but sweeteners are hard to find, if you want to avoid the calories, but have a sweet tooth.We even saw a tiger in Chitwan. I understand that even local rangers have waited years to see one. Guess we were lucky (only 20m away). But rhinos, sloth bears, and monkeys and deer are plentiful. The elephant safari was fun and novel. The animals seemed to be well treated. 4 People only on each elephant, together with the mahout. We also had a jeep safari, shared with other visitors (10 per open topped \"jeep\") & a jungle walk. Packed a lot in! We wondered about malaria prophylaxis but it appears that it has been decades since a case from Chitwan has been reported.There are 7 World Heritage sites in Kathmandu. Sadly, like all developing world countries, pollution is a problem with haze spreading throughout the day. The earthquake damage is being repaired, but it will take time. The Durbars,particularly the one in Patan is amazing still. I hadn't appreciated the way Nepal had influenced both Hinduism and Buddhism until I visited. The notion that there were numerous warring nations unifying into one was familiar to someone in the UK, but put a new spin on a familiar tune in Nepal. The variety of different ethnicities and the melding of Tibetan and Indian peoples makes Nepal unique with its diverse heritage. Hindi, due to Bollywood, is widely understood. The spoken numbers in both Nepali and Hindi are the same. The greeting \"Nameste\" and thank you, \"Danevaad\" will get you far in the country. Money changers are plentiful in the cities, but not so in the countryside.We changed our itinerary a few times, but Pradip accommodated without any issue - of course, where there was a cancellation fee, we had to cover it but that is only fair.My wife is already planning to go back - she muttered something about Everest base camp. Better start getting fit. I guess you must ask yourself why so many visitors are repeat ones that keep going back?"

From the moment we landed in Kathmandu, Pradip and his team were fantastic. Our trip leader went through the schedule and gave us our duffle bags and warm feather down jackets. Our group of six friends set off early morning with a packed breakfast, to catch the flight to Lukla. The flight left on time and landed safely in the mountains. Along with our trip leader, there were two assistant trip leaders and six porters, who joined us at Lukla. All of the team were very friendly, helpful and experienced in the mountains. Over the next ten days we climbed slowly upwards with much needed acclimatization days. The teahouses were simple but comfortable and served tasty food. The day hike up to Gorekshep was tough with the altitude and followed by a quick lunch. We then picked up our cameras ready for the walk to Everest Base Camp, which felt like walking on the moon. Our guides kept us safe going past a slight landslide area and over the thin ridge alongside the beautiful glacier. Reaching base camp was an amazing moment wilst feeling very proud and tired! We had bonded well with our excellent team of guides so it was great sharing it with them. A lifetime's memory to cherish.Overall, Mountain Monarch are the company to travel with in Nepal. The guides are very professional and really show their love of this beautiful country. Part of the reason for choosing Mountain Monarch was because they have a one trekker to one porter policy which really helps these men to perform their tough job at high altitudes. The only slight negative was the schedule of three consecutive long walking days, but that was because of the very high altitude. Our trip leader explained that we needed to get back down to lower altitudes, so spreading things out over another day was not advisable. In the end, we were all glad to be back in Nanche Bazzaar for Christmas Day. If you are looking to go trekking in Nepal, Mountain Monarch are the specialists to choose. I'd love to come back and trek again with the same brilliant guides: Dawa, Arjun, Mingma and Kolanda. Thanks for an awe inspiring holiday!"

Pradip and Subesh, the owners, take care of everything and provide personal assistance from the moment you arrive at the airport in Kathmandu till the day you leave. They know the mountains, their trips are very reasonably priced and it's hard to understand why individuals choose large international tour companies that charge 2 to 3 times more to provide the same experience. Pradip customized our trip to accommodate our schedule at no extra charge. My previous trips with MM were The Everest Circuit (my personal favorite) and The Annapurna Circuit.

The Himalayas of Nepal are spectacular, the trek is arduous & rewarding but the best part of it: our team leader + 2 sherpas took care of us like no other! They woke us up early in the morning with hot tea, encouraged us during the harder moments of ascent, monitored our symptoms (in order to prevent altitude sickness), warmed our spirits with stories, positive attitude, songs & happy moods everyday. Mountain Monarch went above and beyond my high expectations. I will without a doubt join a Mountain Monarch trekking group in the future again! We trekked 5 months after the earthquake of April 2015 and i wish to insist: NEPAL IS SAFE TO TRAVEL! Nepal is recovering well and need tourism money to rebuild its country!

We did \u2018Everest High Passes and Peaks\u2019, which brought us to high passes and peaks like Renjo La, Gokyo Ri, Cho La, Everest Base Camp, Kala Patthar as well as the unforgettable Imja Tse (Island Peak) at 6189m.

Guides in every trek was real professionals. The fuel crisis provoked heavy problems of travelling in Nepal but Company organized every part of the trip with no delay. I think the Company and its Managing Director Pradip are responsible and have all necessary equipment to realize the travelling in the best way."

            "review": "A gret choice for trekking. We did the ten day Annapurna Dhaulagiri trek in October of 2015. The adventure was for myself and my two adult stepsons. I come from an extensive history in the travel industry so am familiar with researching tour providers. I narrowed it down to 4 companies out of the seemingly hundreds online but it did not take long before Mountain Monarch impressed me the most with how they responded to my inquiries. Pradip, the owner and front man was incredibly quick responding and very thorough explaining everything in terms that I was able to understand. He is amazingly good at his job!Originally we were going to join one of their small groups but then we decided to see what the cost difference would be for just the three of us. Pradip said there would be no difference so we chose that travel style. We had two guides Amirit and BJ and two porters. Every one of the four was cheerful, considerate, and careful and totally impressed us. On Day 6 we were to hike to Kair Lake but the day before that trail received 3 feet of snow. Our guide discussed this with us and warned us that the day would be extremely difficult under those circumstances and dangerous so was encouraging us to consider alternatives. That made good sense so we agreed and within hours they had a new itinerary for the balance of our trek put together which turned out to be an excellent revision in response to the unexpected snowstorm. I was impressed with the way they handled that event.The porters did an excellent job for us, the lodges we stayed at seemed to be amongst the best choices and all of our trek meals were included with plenty of variety and quality. Mountain Monarch have excellent down jackets available for the occasional cold morning and super warm sleeping bags for the nights. I fully recommend that before you decide on a trekking company talk to Pradip. I am also happy to respond to any questions. In short Nepal is a wonderful destination with so many trekking trails you will be amazed. I did think of two suggestions \u2013 Apart from our ten day trek we had booked three nights in Kathmandu and two nights in Pokhara. We decided to switch that around to 3 nights in Pokhara. Kathmandu is historically interesting but Pokhara is just a really cool city. Also very strongly consider flying at least in one direction between Pokhara and Kathmandu if you are in that area because the drive between the two cities is a little on the scary side and takes a good 7 hours (200 km).Thanks to Pradip and team for keeping us safe, informed and for your friendships."

The staff is highly trained, super knowledgeable & friendly. Our guide Akkash was awesome. From the start he made us feel at ease and safe. With him, it was like a walk in the park. He had a solution for every little problem of ours. I thought that EBC would be my highlight coming to Nepal but each pass was more beautiful than the one before. I recommend 3 passes & peaks for people looking for a challenging trek at high altitude. It definitely took our breath away! We really enjoy ourselves and Mountain Monarch was definitely part of it. Plus, it was really important for us to support a Nepalese company and responsible trekking. 1 porter 1 trekker is a beautiful initiative by MM. Post-earthquake, I truly believe that Nepal is ready to welcome tourism. Rebuilding Nepal by trekking!"

Two weeks ago I returned from Nepal after doing the Annapurna Dhaulagiri Trek with Mountain Monarch \u2013 fifteen days in all \u2013 with twelve fellow South Africans.What a carefree, exciting and memorable trip it was! All hats off to Mr Pradip and his team who made sure that all our needs were met and that we came away with such positive and happy memories of our time in Nepal. As owner of Mountain Monarch, Mr Pradip was there to welcome and see off all of his clients from the hotel in Kathmandu. He certainly runs a very principled company, one that I would recommend without any hesitation.Our guide Sunil was able to answer even our most obscure questions and was unfailingly patient, helpful, warm and good humoured. As were his assistant guides: Khuch, Bijaya, Pemba and Santay. Our porters smiled under their loads and got stuck in in the tea house kitchens helping Pemba and his fellow cooks to prepare and present the most delicious, nutritious meals, even under difficult circumstances when stocks were low because of the fuel crisis. We were most impressed that our Mountain Monarch team happily cooked for other trekkers not of our group when at the teahouse on Khopra Ridge, the staff there having left to join their families for their big annual festival. The camaraderie amongst the Mountain Monarch team members was always evident.The pace set on the Nepalese \u201cflats\u201d as well as on the more vertical uphills was good and our trek was incident free. The accommodation in the tea-houses along the way varied in style, as did the setting of the tea-houses \u2013 so all in all we had a wide-ranging experience of what the beautiful country of Nepal \u2013 and its warm-hearted people \u2013 has to offer.A definite 5-star experience! Thank you to all at Mountain Monarch."

Our Anapurna Dhaulagiri trip with Mountain Monarch exceeded our expectations in every way. Mr Pradip answered our emails timeously and efficiently from the day we started planning our trip. We were a little apprehensive after the earthquake hit Nepal but needn\u2019t have been. Mountain Monarch as a company were outstanding. Mr Pradip led by example. Everything was planned and executed to perfection. Sunil was our fabulous, knowledgeable team leader. He was ably assisted by a team of four assistant guides who also helped with the cooking at some of the teahouses and our happy, smiling porters. We felt as if we were being looked after by professionals who went out of their way to make our holiday the most memorable experience. The Anapurna Dhaulagiri trek is absolutely beautiful. We felt as if we had a taste of the best that Nepal could offer. We walked through magnificent rhododendrons and forests that were reminiscent of Tolkien\u2019s \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d. We also crossed many crystal clear streams and waterfalls, before emerging into the grasslands above the tree line. Most mornings we woke at dawn to witness the sun coming up on the magnificent, awe inspiring peaks of Anapurna, Fish Tail, Dhaulagiri and many more. The accommodation was basic, but clean. The food was much better than we expected and we often had a choice of meal. The kit provided by Mountain Monarch, (sleeping bags, jackets, rain poncho, and tog bag) was excellent. Our group of twelve , aged mainly in our fifties, found the walk challenging in parts, but well worth the effort. No-one battled too much and we were always rewarded by the most spectacular scenery. However, it was the people of Nepal, and the Mountain Monarch team, in particular, that really impressed us.. Despite, the earthquake and the recent fuel shortages, they remained cheerful, peaceful, kind and caring and we will always hold them close to our hearts. Even though we were there during the fuel crisis, our plans were never altered and everything worked like clockwork. Mr Pradip even organised a flight around Everest for us which was spectacular. Thank you Mountain Monarch for this amazing trip of a life time which I would definitely recommend."

We were so happy and impressed with the Mountain Monarch team starting with Pradip Limbu, the managing director and our main contact at Mountain Monarch. He responded very quickly to our many inquiries and gave lots of reassurance to our safety concerns, especially after the earthquake when we had to change our trekking plan due to damage in the Manaslu area. Instead we trekked to Gokyo Lakes, Gokyo Ri and Renjo La. It was a fabulous trip and met all of our expectations. Pradip made us feel cared for from our first contact nearly a year before our trip until the end of our trek and time in Nepal. It is not possible to imagine a more responsive business leader. His concern for his clients is matched by his caring for his loyal guides and porters. ONE PORTER PER CLIENT!We were equally impressed with the rest of our team, our guide, Mingma, and his assistant, Nima, and all our porters. We always felt like they were looking out for us and putting our interests and safety first. We had never been at such high altitudes (5350 meters) before, but with their guidance we all did quite well and successfully completed our trek, seeing fabulous views and having lots of fun along the way. We really enjoyed the company of our team, we played cards with all of them at some of the less crowded lodges. Our trek was 17 days since we added in some extra time to acclimate and explore the lakes. That also gave us a cushion for a few cloudy days so we didn't have to hit the high points in less than ideal viewing conditions. The views from Gokyo Ri and Renjo La were all we hoped for!Things to be aware of: the lodges are very basic, the guides will provide advice on food choices to stay healthy, but you will order from the teahouse menus. Distances covered are not great, except for the pass crossing day. What makes this challenging is the altitude more than the distances. Our guides kept us going quite slowly to minimize the risk of altitude problems which worked for all of us. Be sure to use your hot water bottles to warm up your sleeping bag!"

Local outfit with a one porter one guest policy which is currently unheard of in Nepal. Hopefully not for much longer.I was impressed that MM kept the trips going despite a dramatic drop in clients due to April earthquake. For EBC trek there were only 3 clients and for the Island Peak section only 2. There was a lack of communication prior to the trip but emails were answered promptly.Our guides Ram and Prakash looked after us very well throughout the entire trip. We took their advice and stuck to basic vegetarian dishes until after the Island Peak climb. As a result we only had two minor incidences of stomach trouble.Teahouses are basic and most have communal toilets. Some have showers that you pay extra for while others don't even have running water for guests. Our guides always had sanitation gel at hand in the dining rooms. The camp site at Island Peak was very good. Saila, the cook, was a magician when it came to the variety of food we ate.The climbing day at Island Base Camp is quite basic but gives you the skills required for the big day. As I had no climbing experience Tsheten, our climbing sherpa, was with me every step of the way. An advantage of there only being two clients one of which was a competent climber.Equipment supplied by MM was top quality and saves you having to rent or buy it. With climbing gear already at base camp it also means that the 15kg limit on total luggage to Lukla is not as bad as it could have been. As it is the climbing boots and holdall are pretty heavy which doesn't leave much room for too many luxuries!Overall top service and I would recommend Mountain Monarch."

To summarize, this was the most epic, beautiful, thrilling, spiritual trip I've ever taken. Honestly, I embarked on the trip with dread. I pictured climbing a lunar landscape while suffering from altitude sickness in third world chaos. I was so mistaken. We traveled to Europe twice last year, including Switzerland, but I can honestly say trekking in Nepal, particularly with Mountain Monarch, was by far my favorite trip EVER. Despite the misinformation currently on the United States travel advisory website, everything has gone completely smoothly. All of our flights and helicopters were on schedule. And because so many of you are avoiding Nepal (because why? the earthquake six months ago?!) we enjoyed no crowds on the trek. Mountain Monarch is special in that they hope to exemplify responsible trekking. This means they only allocate one client's bag to one porter (other less responsible companies saddle their porters with two bags, a ridiculously burdensome load). We fell in love with our caring, professional knowledgeable, local guides. Dipen and Dahwa took every precaution to help us avoid altitude sickness through proper acclimation and with the help of a little Diamox and Decadron, all five of us summitted 18,500 feet without trouble, including our 13-year-old neighbor Briley (who admittedly is incredibly fit, strong and exceptional). The tea houses were charming and delightful (although the rooms very rustic and basic. If you're a whiner or princess this trip is not for you.) It was so fun to meet other trekkers from all over the world in the tea houses. Some of them were on very special pilgrimages for loved ones. Learning from Dipen Ri, our amazing guide, about Hinduism and Buddhism, attending a ritual by monks at a high mountain monastery, learning about Stupas and prayer flags and prayer wheels was absolutely beautiful. Above all were the majestic mountains. They are indescribable. Actually, so is the whole experience. Find out by booking a trekking trip to base camp on Mt Everest with Mountain Monarch. It's life changing."

Everything was well organized and handled in a thoughtful, caring manner - from our short visit in Kathmandu, to the carefree early days of hiking through the Khumbu toward base camp, and especially during the April earthquake and its aftermath. We were in Dingboche, about 2 or 3 days from base camp, when the earthquake struck. Our wonderful guide, Dipen Rai, balanced all the difficulties of our safety, his own family concerns, communication and decision-making. With Dipen's support we determined to slowly make our way back out of the high mountains - I feel that this quiet return brought us a stronger appreciation of the Sherpa people and their beautiful region even in the face of the greater tragedy of the earthquake.Dipen is completely professional and at the same time has a spirit of fun that we both loved - he is full of information about the geography, people and culture of the Khumbu. He never denied the potential danger of the return trek but led us confidently and calmly. It was an emotionally moving experience and we had the best possible partner in Mountain Monarch."

The MM staff handled all of our needs and were especially accommodating making sure we were safe and enjoying our adventure. The landscape is gorgeous and the views amazing. Equipment provided was great and, of course, saved us the burden of carrying it from home. Adjustments had to be made during our trek. Pradip and his staff handled these issues professionally and effectively making our trip the experience we were looking for in Nepal. Finally, we arrived in Nepal about 4 months post earthquake. Kathmandu is functioning and our hotel there was fine - no evidence of any related damage of concern. From what we could see, Nepal and Mountain Monarch are capably open for business."

Our guide, Dipen Rai did an excellent job keeping us safe and making alternative plans for our way down to Kathmandu. Even with the destruction, Dipen was able to plan a route that still made our trip enjoyable and satisfying. While we never made it to Kalapathar, our trip allowed us to spend more time meeting people and exploring the Khumbu region in greater detail. All of the porters and guides on our trip were helpful and I would be happy to book another trip with Mountain Monarch in the future."

Return visits are extremely common with this company due to their top notch service. Everything was handled smoothly - from the initial planning emails with Pradip to unpredictable weather changes on the mountain. Nima once again proved to be an invaluable guide - knowledgable, friendly, fun, and always organized. Safety is always mountain monarch's top priority. Since the earthquake, the guides have been busy rebuilding schools and houses in the damaged rural areas - so great to see them take an active role in rebuilding their own community. Wouldn't hesitate to come back for a third trek with MM!"

Initially I had many questions which were answered very prompty by Mr Pradip Limbu. Once we arrived in Nepal we were so incredibly well looked after by our team headed up by Ngima Sherpa. We were lucky enough to travel from Kathmandu to Lukla by helicopter rather than plane at no additional cost - amazing! The Three Peaks and Passes trek was jaw droppingly beautiful and the lodges we stayed in were all clean and comfortable. Unfortunately the April 25 earthquake hit in the middle of our trek which changed our plans completely. However, even when the team didnt know if their own families were safe, they had our welfare and safety at the forefront of their minds the entire time after the quake. If you are looking for a Nepal Trekking holiday, you absolutely cannot go past Mountain Monarch!"

We were incredibly well looked after from the moment we arrived at the airport. The kit provided was top notch, Pradip (the MD) was on hand to ensure that everything was in place and our guide CP gave us the perfect welcome with his infectious enthusiasm. Once the trek was underway CP proved to be a superb leader; sensitive to the varying needs within the group, encouraging and highly knowledgable. The team of climbing Sherpas, porters & kitchen staff were excellent and the efforts to rebuild the porters' homes after the destructive earthquakes illustrate very well the care that Mountain Monarch have for their staff. We enjoyed our trek very much and would be certain to use Mountain Monarch the next time we visit Nepal."

Mountain Monarch organised everything, from the time we got off the plane at Kathmandu, until we returned to Kathmandu. Their organisation was superb. During the trek they put health and safety first but without being over burdening. The team were willing and helpful adapting the itinerary as necessary; taking account of differing fitness levels in the party and the weather. One of the Sherpas even started taking hotos for me! At the end of the day my wife and I had a great time. The memories will last a lifetime."

What marks Mountain Monarch out as different is their outstanding attention to looking after the safety and wellbeing of their clients. Our trek was hampered by unseasonably bad weather and snow, but throughout our guides Krishida and Roshan remained positive and upbeat. They made a good decision not to attempt the Cho La Pass due to poor weather, but despite this we all had a great time with each other during the trek. On return to Kathmandu and during the subsequent earthquake, I was highly impressed with how the Mountain Monarch team sought to not only selflessly help their clients, but also other people who were in need. Pradip and his team have very high personal standards, and a genuine compassion for others. They are also deeply passionate about sharing their beautiful country with others. I recommend them, and look forward to trekking with Mountain Monarch again in future."

From the moment we arrived in Kathmandu to the moment we left, the organisation was first class. Most importantly, this is a company that places emphasis on safety and the well-being of the entire party. Their priority though, certainly based on our experiences, was to make sure you have fun. Although there were six of us, we had a support team of 14, comprising our Guide - C.P. - who was outstanding, our two climbing Sherpas - Bise and Ngawa - who were so supportive (nothing was too much trouble), our porters and kitchen crew. Over the three weeks these were not only our support team, they became our friends. We still remember the farewell party!If you're looking for a trekking company that knows Nepal, will provide you with memories that will stay with you for the rest of your life and provide a team that really want to make sure you have the best possible experience, I have no hesitation in recommending Mountain Monarch!"

We felt well looked after from the airport pick up through to the end of our trip which included the earthquake.

My daughter and I trekked to Everest Base Camp with Mountain Monarch (MM) and would highly recommend them to anyone planning to trek in Nepal. From my very first email enquiry and prompt reply from Pradip (the owner) I knew we had made the right choice. Every email was responded to within hours, which I could not believe, and always with great information which made the preparation for the trek much easier. We exchanged emails with fellow trekkers in our group before the trip which was a really nice touch. It was a great way to swap ideas on what equipment to bring and how to prepare as well as learn a little about the people we would be spending two weeks with.From the moment we landed in Kathmandu we were looked after in every possibly way. The guides, assistant guides and porters were all brilliant and could not do enough for us from the moment we woke up until we fell into bed each night. We loved the many conversations we had every day to better understand the culture, the people and the amazing environment. They were always there if you needed them. They kept a very close eye on how we were all feeling each day and ensured we were drinking plenty of water and walking at at own pace. Our health and safety was a clear priority and the group had very few problems which was a credit to the MM crew.The trek to Base Camp has been on my \"bucket list\" for many years and MM and our fellow trekkers made the whole experience very special. My daughter had her birthday on the mountain and she was presented with a birthday cake and gifts. So unexpected and such a wonderful memory for us both.Would I trek with MM again? Absolutely!

Since we were coming from living in Thailand, we didn't have trekking gear and our guide Dawa was great in helping us choose appropriate trekking boots. Our flights to Lukla were cancelled for two days because of the weather, and it was great to have the support of Mountain monarch. They provided us with accommodation in the same hotel for those extra days as well as being very well organised in adapting our trek to a new time frame. On the trek, they always encouraged us to stay at our own pace and it was comforting to have guides at the front, middle and back. Any medication you needed, they provided it for us. We feel very fortunate to have had a wonderfully run company. On return to Kathmandu, we shipped goods home. We had shipped our goods on New Years Eve (in Nepal), however we hadn't received our tracking number because of public holidays. Mountain Monarch personally contacted the shipping company when we were unable to. Our goods have arrived home safe and sound but we were most impressed with the kindness and support from prior to the trek right up until a week after we had left the country.

Our leader, Dawa, as well as his assistant guides, Pemba and Robin, and the \"crew\" (porters) were consistently helpful and friendly.We had a delayed arrival when the Kathmandu airport was closed for a few days, and later, one of our party had health problems which led her to have to stay in Chomrong while the rest of us went on to Annapurna Base Camp. Pradip and Dawa helped us deal with the logistics of the setbacks, even arranging a full dinner for us at midnight when we left the Kathmandu airport on our ultimate arrival day.We could see elements of thoughtfulness of Mountain Monarch that felt like we were getting better treatment than some of the other groups we encountered at the teahouses--that we were supplied with boiled water for our water bottles and that the meals were included in the cost of the trip.The base hotel in Kathmandu was conveniently located.The cultural day tour of Kathmandu was also well designed and interesting, with a great guide.We would certainly use Mountain Monarch again were we to return to Nepal."

The idea was that my group would fly up the next day to meet me, but Pradip promised that if the group got delayed for any reason I could begin my hike, since he arranged for my porter and guide to already be in Lukla.Sure enough, weather forced the cancellation of two days of flights, but true to his word, Pradip allowed me to begin my journey.

This is my third trek with MMA, having previously done ABC and Ama Dablam BC with them, and every single one has been a grand adventure.The first leg of our trek was up the Langtang Valley to Kyanjin Gompa and back (Syabrubesi - Lama Hotel - Langtang Village - Kyanjin Gompa - Lama Hotel - Thulo Syabru). The second leg brought us up to Gosainkunda Lakes, over the Laurebina Pass at 4610m and through the Helambu region back to Kathmandu (Thulo Syabru - Shing Gompa - Gosainkunda Lake - Gopte - Kutumsang - Chisopani - Sundarijal). The whole journey took 12 days in all, and brought us through many magical moments: the wide, wind-swept expanse with all-round views of snow-capped peaks in Langtang Valley, the pine forest with flowering rhodendrons around Shing Gompa, spectacular night skies at Gosainkund, snowy fun at Laurebina Pass, the \"winter wonderland\" feel at Thadepati pass, sunrise/sunset views of misty valleys in Kutumsang... we felt like Hobbits on a magical journey, minus the scary bits involving the beardy guy and that angry fellow with the burning eye... and hairy feet, of course.MMA uses only in-house guides, who are sent on courses (eg. leadership, mountain medicine) and apprenticeships as assistant guides before they lead treks. Independent freelancers may be cheaper, but can also be more variable. They also look after their porters, providing cold wear (for some treks) and insurance... basic things, but important.Guides carry first aid and medicine kits, which most others also do, but also oxygen tanks and pressurised tents (for the higher altitude treks), which is most other companies do not. You only have one chance to fail in an emergency situation. I also like the fact that they provide personal equipment (down sleeping bags, down jackets, gaiters, etc.) that would be impractical for infrequent adventurers like myself to buy and own.I am more of a comfort traveller seeking some (but not too much!) adventure, so I appreciate the convenience of having a room at the next teahouse booked (I've always gotten one, but I'm told this is not guaranteed, especially during peak season) in advance and getting to order anything I want to eat from the menu, though drinks are on one's own tab. Papads, prawn crackers, French fries and cheese fritters were readily available to satisfy my gluttony (need to pay for them, but at low prices like USD$1-2 per plate).MMA's itineraries are also slower (though this can be customised to your own needs and schedules), so there is more time to acclimatise and simply to enjoy the experience of trekking at one's own pace amidst such natural beauty, without having to worry about rushing to reach the next destination before sundown. On this trek, we averaged between 6-8 hours trekking per day, which left plenty of time for lunch, tea and impromptu breaks to enjoy the local bakeries or just a picnic next to amazing scenery. The pace was never rushed, and we always got to the next teahouse with time to spare for interacting with other trekkers or exploring the environs.Service was also impeccable, and I appreciate Mr Pradip personally coming down to the hotel to greet us, attend to our needs and send us off.Recommend MMA to friends? Yes, definitely. Even before finishing this trip, I was already thinking and looking forward to the next one!"

This is the second trek I've done with them and they exceeded my expectations both times. They have great group leaders and guides who really know the areas we hiked in, and gave us lots of information and history about the areas.The treks are well organized and they provide all the basics like sleeping bag and liner, heavy parka, rain poncho, and duffle bag. The guides looked after us from start to finish and made sure we all had a fantastic experience."

Pradip did an excellent job putting our trip together and arranging transfers to and from the airport during our entire stay in Nepal. When the Lukla airport was shutdown for the day, mountain monarch took on all the responsibility - ensuring we had a place to stay, were well fed, and worked hard to find options for us get back to Kathmandu all whilst we enjoyed ourselves in Lukla. They got us on one of the first flights out of Lukla, while other trekkers were still stranded. Even after our itinerary with Mountain Monarch was completed, Pradip gave us his cell phone number and made himself available if we had any trouble or any other needs during the remainder of our stay in Nepal. He treated us as much more than simply clients. He even visited us on our last day in Nepal to greet us and wish us a safe trip back. We were happy with the equipment that mountain monarch provided: sleeping bags, liners, down jacket, brand new trekking poles, etc. Far superior than those provide other trekking companies that we have gone with in the past. They also had a strong emphasis on safety and carried oxygen and medication in case of an emergency. Our guide safely guided us through our trek and made sure we were well taken care of. At each of our stops, he catered to our needs to ensure we had everything we needed and felt comfortable. We had such unbelievable amazing memories during our trek and we cannot thank the mountain monarch team enough. This is the best company to go with and we are glad we did."

            "review": "We saw Everest. We did the first part of the Everest Base Camp hike with Mountain Monarch in the first part of March 2015. We planned to go to Tempboche, but there was a lot of snow, so we cut it short once we had viewed Everest from the Everest View Hotel, above Namche Bazaar. Despite not going as far as we had planned, it was amazing and fantastic. Our guide Ram was super wonderful, picked us up at the airport in Kathmandu, saw us to our hotel, took us on a welcome meal, then a few days later took us to the airport for the trip to Lukla. We were so glad he was there, the airport to Lukla story is a complete zoo yet Ram had us thru and on the plane in no time. Throughout the trek Ram took excellent care of us and saw us happily and safely thru the trip. His village is close to Lukla, and he really knows the route and lots of interesting information along the way. He insisted that we head up to the Everest View Hotel first thing in the morning because he believed the weather would sock in in the afternoon and he was completely right. We had a gorgeous sunny day view of Everest and all the mountains. The smile on my face hasn't gone away yet!! He completely arranged the change of plans so everything was seamless. Once we were back in Kathmandu for some days he saw us to the airport. In addition, Mr Pradip met us several times to make sure everything was OK and arranged a guide for some cultural trips in Kathmandu before and after the trek, which added so much to our trip. Also, the Hotel Tibet that Mr. Pradip arranged was really great, quaint and friendly. I was a bit leary before we left about the hotel in Kathmandu, but I was completely happy with it.Of course, in theory, we could have done this on our own, but it was so wonderful and easy with guide and porter and so much less hassle. We really felt taken care of the whole time. The porter Suriya was great. He is Ram's relative, so they were a team. A porter is really really important.We are an older retired couple, and my only comment is that if you want upscale accommodation on the trek, do let Pradip know before you go and that you are willing to pay extra for that. 95% of the lodges are basic - very basic. Apparently there are a few mid range and one very expensive high end option. So if you want to upgrade (and pay more!!) be very clear about that.Overall, it was truly an astonishing and amazing trek, even just to the Everest View Hotel (staying in Namche Bazaar) was truly wonderful. Mountain Monarch is a good company to go with, they did everything they said they would and treated us well and fairly."

            "review": "Highly Recommended!. We enthusiastically give Mountain Monarch the top 5 star rating for our Annapurna Base Camp trip starting March 1, 2015! Our guide, Ngima Sarki Sherpa, was terrific! Ngima is actually a high altitude specialist and has taken many mountaineering courses, so he was extremely qualified. Furthermore, our porter, Jaya Tamang was wonderful, always sporting a big smile no matter how steep the hillside, or how crappy the weather! Jaya (who is also called Jay) turned out to be a good improvisational cook as well. And Pradip Limbu, the Managing Director, did a great job organizing our trip. What we really appreciated was the flexibility we were given. For example, the Annapurna Base Camp became temporarily closed due to excessive snow and avalanche danger, so we went to an alternate, very quiet, high elevation location which we loved! This entailed trekking for several extra days which we were able to pay for after the trek.Furthermore, after our trek, we decided to go to the Chitwan Park, and Pradip quickly organized this great additional experience for us. Some other reasons for choosing Mountain Monarch are:1. Mountain Monarch\u2019s guides have taken courses in health issues that can arise during a trek. Indeed, they have studied wilderness first aid, are knowledgeable about altitude sickness, and are equipped with a comprehensive medical kit. 2. Mountain Monarch provides their clients with plenty of boiled water, so their clients have safe drinking water without contributing to the myriads of used bottles! The hot water bottles also do wonders for your sleeping bag at night when the weather is cold and damp at the higher altitudes that we were at!3. All the food during the trek is included in the price, and the client can choose what he wants to eat. One does not have to order from a \u2018set menu\u2019.4. Mountain Monarch supplies warm sleeping bags, down jackets, gaiters, and \u2018yak tracks\u2019 which are crampon like devices for icy conditions. These \u2018yak tracks\u2019 made the trek much safer and easier. Many people were slipping and sliding without them!5. Finally, Mountain Monarch is very competitively priced! As their slogan states, \u201cExplore the Himalayas with local experts\u201d!"

Pradip the owner, is professional and attentive to all the details of the trip. From meeting us in Kathmandu to the trek then to Chitwan National Park then driving us to the airport to leave Nepal, Pradip made every effort to make our trip comfortable and exciting. The trekking gear that was provided was of high quality and kept us more than warm in below zero temperatures. It was fantastic and we received duffle bags and shirts to take home, which was a nice bonus. Netra was the lead guide and he and his team, attended to us when we were sick and when we were having fun, with care and friendship and a truly professional attitude. Everyone treated the children with such respect and care, they will never forget it. The trip was incredible, and waking up in Thyangboche monastery blanketed in snow was truly the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, then to walk back to Namche Bazaar in thick snow was incredibly brilliant. Throughout all of this the team made us feel like we were walking with friends, and when we needed them they were there. I highly recommend Mountain Monarch to go trekking with and wish the entire team all the best."

The company were outstanding in every respect. Pradip the owner was attentive to every detail from our first enquiry until the day we left. Nothing was too much trouble and he responded to all our queries and requests quickly. Our guide Dawa was absolutely first rate, ensuring that we had a safe and enjoyable trip all the way. He has many years experience of leading expeditions in the Himalayas and told us some terrific stories en route. He was ably assisted by Pemba, who led from the front all the way at a steady and manageable pace. They also made sure that the porters Jaya and Raju (whose strength and nimble footedness was something to behold) were not only well looked after but were also included in the camaraderie of the trip. The trek itself could not have been better. The views were truly stunning and varied because we crossed from one valley to another. Highlights were: trekking through snow after being caught in a storm near Dobato; the views of the Annapurnas directly above us from Khopra Ridge; the view of the Kali Ghandaki Gorge, the second deepest in the world; the peace and tranquillity of the village of Swanta as people went about their daily tasks; the view of our whole route from Poon Hill; and of course the sites of Kathmandu. The accommodation was in teahouses and although it was very cold indeed at night we enjoyed sitting round the wood-burning stoves, playing cards and talking through the day's experiences. Apart from the storm, the weather was fine although I gather there was a heavy fall of snow soon after we left. That said we had the teahouses all to ourselves after Tadipani, although a loan trekker walked into the Khopra Ridge late one evening, seemingly having come from nowhere. The equipment the company loaned us was of very high quality and even though the temperatures dropped well below freezing each night (the water in the bucket for flushing the toilet froze solid in one lodge!) the down sleeping bags were almost too warm at times.Many thanks to everyone at Mountain Monarch for a truly memorable trip and there you go from strength to strength!"

Our guide Aakash was very experienced and shared his extensive knowledge of the people, places, culture and trail during the trek. He provided the leadership we were looking for as this was our first visit to Nepal and first time trekking at higher altitudes. Aakash took very good care of us and was very attentive to our health throughout the trek. We had no significant altitude health issues. It was also great to see the very positive relationship Mountain Monarch, and Aakash in particular, had established with the numerous people we encountered along the way including teahouse owners and staff and other guides. Our hard working porters were also instrumental in making our trek a success, providing us with daily boiled water and ensuring our gear was waiting for us at the end of each day. All of this made our journey enjoyable and worry free. During our time in Kathmandu, Mountain Monarch provided us with an experienced guide who had a wealth of knowledge about the people and places we visited. After our trek Pradip asked to meet with us to get our direct feedback, which is a very positive process for any business and likely one reason why Mountain Monarch is an excellent trekking company.

The extra few dollars spent with Mountain Monarch will be 1000x better than with a cheaper outfitter. And the porters the other outfitters utilize will be Overloaded with gear. No kidding. Mountain Monarch group size is from 2-8 trekkers.....no more than that. Their porters are treated with dignity and respect. So you will get to know your Sherpas and porters as friends before the end of your trek. I have see large groups outfitters where some trekkers are struggling physically and because the group is so large, the guides/Sherpas have no time to help them. Mr. Pradip, the owner of Mountain Monarch is thoughtful, trustworthy, and professional in every sense of the word. Your email will be promptly answered however simple it is and have professional advice to all your inquiries. You will be personally met at Kathmandu's airport and at the end of the trek, you will driven to the airport for your departure. Mr. Pradip will personally await your arrival at the hotel to greet you, like one of the family. They will stay with you until you pass through the door of the airport at your departure. Mountain Monarch is THE leader in Nepal trekking. All necessary drugs and precautions are brought along during the trek in case someone gets into trouble. All the Sherpas and porters used by Mountain Monarch are top shelf. They are friendly, caring, and genuine. You will be treated like family throughout your trek. In fact, as I write this review, I am contemplating a third trek with Mountain Monarch. Thank you again Mr. Pradip for making my visit to Nepal memorable once again."

From the moment you walked out of the airport, you will be very nicely assisted by your trekking leader or team so you do not have anything to worry about. This time we very much enjoyed Annapurna trekking with gorgeous view of Machhapuchhre under the perfect weather. The food our cook prepared were always amazing! You will never be disappointed with your food. Also, who could have expected that our cooks could even bake a fully handmade birthday cake for my mom at 4000m high camp! She said it was the best birthday ever! Mountain Monarch always surpass my expectation. I can highly recommend this company. Can't wait to go back to Nepal thanks to Mountain Monarch!"

We received extrememly helpful pre-departure advice and kit lists. We were met and welcomed at Kathmandhu Airport by our chief guide. We realised very quickly we were in safe and experienced hands (he had just retuirned from our goal: Mera Peak.) This was especially important since it was only days after the Annapurna tragedy. The organisation of the logistics of the entire trip was perfect and without any problems. The kit provided was entirley appropriate and in good condition. We had full confidence in our Sherpa guides who were kind, helpful, fun, witty and instilled the necessary confidence and drive, and supplied the necessary mountaineering skills, to get 9 out of our party of 11 safely to the summit. The kitchen and portering team was excelltent; if only they had allowed us eat more traditional Nepali food! After we returned to Kathmandhu Pradip continued to be a wonderful host and organised a trip to Chitwan for us with the same organisational skills, charm and efficiency that he had applied to our Mera Peak trip. Pradip and his team gave us a wonderful experience of Nepal. Thank you so much!"

He was very professional and the level of service that the entire team gave us was unparalleled in my travel experience in any country. I highly recommend trekking with Mountain Monarch Adventures.

Their goal was to ensure a successful and safe experience for all clients.

Pradip was very willing to adjust the trip to meet our travel needs and always had a quick reply to any emails.

He took us for a meal in a tea-house, with a view over the valley, and we had an unforgettable Tibetan bread and soup. Near the peak it started raining. Our guide immediately took out Mountain Monarch rain ponchos for us and took us under the shelter. We enjoyed the view while the rain and hail were pouring.

He gave them orientation lessons in the tea houses and talked about the customs of his people to give them a better understanding of Nepal as a country. Finjo was with us the entire journey and was always available to answer any concerns and issues- with a smile. This guy has climber everest and He was our guide. That is very cool! The trek to Poon Hill was tough for the kids, but they made it well and that was helped immensely by Mountain Monarchs planning. A lot of highlights that were made easy by this wonderful company.I couldn't recommend Mountain Monarch enough to delivering an outstanding trip either for your family or, as previously, for something a little more adventurous."

            "review": "Fantastic Service - again!. Just returned from a trip to Nepal with my 11 year old son where we did a trek in Annapurna, white water rafted and did a jungle safari in Chitwan. We were accompanied by two of my friends and three other children so a group of 7 all up. Mountain Monarch was amazing, even better than in 2009 where they organized a trekking peak expedition for 5 of us that went without a hitch. This trip went without a hitch as well and again with everything being organized so we didn't have to worry about any logistics at all. In addition, Mountain Monarch really went the extra mile - provided 2 extra guides - 4 in total (to safeguard the kids a bit more on the trail) and a safety kayaker on the white-water rafting (in case one of the kids fell out) without being asked and at no extra cost. Indeed they lowered the price a bit because some of their permitting costs were reduced for kids. Our lead guide (Finjo) had summited Everest - what a buzz for the kids to be getting compass lessons from an Everest summiteer! Even more impressive Finjo has academic qualifications in child development and had an amazing rappore with them! Finjo stayed with us through all parts of the trip which really helped. Pradip, the managing director was always available and indeed essentially operates out of the hotel in Kathmandu where we stayed. I had asked Pradip a favour, whether some certificates could be made and presented to the kids on their return - Pradip readily ageed and the certificates were very well done (the kids are very proud of them, my boy has his on his wall). Only negative was the white water rafting lead guide wasn't particularly \"child friendly\" - not awful, just not used to kids rafting would be my guess - this part of the trip was sub-contracted but I mentioned this minor issue to Pradip and I am sure he will review his sub-contractor for the next time.I have personally been to Nepal 5 times, I am likely to return in 2015 and will certainly be utilising Mountain Monarch again.Regards,Mike DworkinPerth, Australia"

He takes great pride in making sure the company is as good as it can possibly be, and is always looking for helpful/constructive suggestions as to how the company might do things even better. I have no hesitation in recommending Mountain Monarch to fellow travellers, and I know that if/when I'm next back in Nepal, I'll definitely be traveling with them again."

The first day was a great tour of Kathmandu - monkey temple, Crematorium, Kathmadu palace tours etc. very interesting.

Very knowledgeable and a real support for my wife and I (who are not experienced Trekkers). Everything was looked after and well organised. They ensured we had the best accomodation in all villages. Pream, our porter was amazing - took our two bags up and down the mountain and they were ready and waiting for us at every village we stayed at.

Making a long story short - the hotel owners says he knows someone that knows more about Everest Base Camp trek and I'll invite him over for breakfast Saturday morning.We met Gokul at 11 a.m and within two hours I packed my bag, stored other stuff at Mi Casa and was in a van headed to airport to take a heli up to Lukla and start a five day trek up to Tengboche and back. It was nuts and once of the most memorable experiences - I'd say the most - of my two month solo journey around the world. Top notch guide, great service, good guest houses and special thanks to Pemba my guide.

They always make sure we're on good & healthy condition, oh and patiently waiting for me who walk like a snail.

After various inquiries with different tour operators, I finally decided to let Outshine Adventure handle my family's cultural & sightseeing tour of Nepal. The main reason is that the owner, Mr. Gokul Sapkota was quick to reply to my queries. Pricing was reasonable and he was able to offer all that we required- comfortable hotels, private vehicles with air-conditioning, knowledgeable guide & airport transfers. Had I asked for a helicopter in case I needed to be bailed out of altitude sickness, I'm sure he could have easily arranged it too. Okay, I'm going too far talking about altitude sickness. There's no such thing when just visiting UNESCO sites & looking at the Himalayas from a low hill, sipping organic Nepali tea if you please. To put it simply, Gokul is very resourceful & trustworthy.We arrived late at night with our flight delayed for an hour. I thought we could get out of the airport easily as we already filled out our Nepalese visa application online. But then, the airport carousel took so long to spew out the last luggage, with none of ours arriving. We got more delayed coming out of the airport because we had to file for baggage tracking. Anyway, after that arrival hiccup, we were quite happy to see the Outshine representative whose name I forgot meet us when we got out. He & the driver were very patient in waiting for us & i commend them for that. The following morning, we met up with Gokul in his office right in Thamel. He briefed us about our tour. We paid him the balance of our tour cost. He also helped us with currency exchange, giving us a much better rate than at the airport or elsewhere. He was very cordial & we felt assured that we could count on him.Siri, our guide for our day tours in Kathmandu, was knowledgeable, helpful & professional. We also felt safe with all the drivers. All the vehicles used were comfortable and bigger than the typical car in Nepal which can be quite tiny.Before we left Nepal, we had dinner with Gokul and met his beautiful young family. I'm so glad I went with Gokul & his Outshine Adventure team. You can easily see the passion he has to succeed as well as helping others.Overall, we felt safe & had a great time in Nepal. Do go if you haven't. I want to go back someday. Thank you, Gokul and Outshine Adventure team."

We arrived New Years eve, with the plan for the next few days to check out all the tourist sites ourselves. Well, a few days of travel from the states and having to switch hotels after one night left us a bit exhausted. We opted to utilize the services of a Tour Provider in the area. We found Gokul and Outshine Adventures here on Tripadvisor. Our hotel was only a 10 minute walk from the office, so we decided to go over and see what could be arranged for the next two days in Kathmandu. Even though it was last minute, Gokul put together an excellent itinerary with one of the best guides I've experienced during my travels! Gokul also advised against some of the items we were asking about (His thoughts were, the weather wasn't clear enough to see anything....he was totally right!)The driver and car were both great as well! I really can't say anything bad about the tours Gokul setup. The guide even helped us with buying some medicine at the pharmacy, and was very understanding when one of us was feeling a bit under the weather towards the end of the tour and just wanted to relax. (Sorry to the Thangka School we were touring at the time....the work was beautiful and If not for starting to not feel well, we definitely would have stayed longer and bought something!) Gokul even helped arrange our airport transfer back to the airport.The trip ended up being such an incredible experience, thanks in part to Gokul. If I find my way back to Nepal (which I very much hope I do!), I will absolutely be utilizing the services of Outshine Adventure. Thanks again for everything!"

I did so based on the many excellent TripAdvisor reviews. I was travelling with my 20 year old daughter who was living in India at the time. Gokul (the owner) was very responsive to emails prior to departure and was very clear about exactly what was included and what was not included in our tour package. We were very late coming out of the airport because of long visa lines and also because the airline had lost my luggage. I was worried the driver might not wait so long but he was waiting there with the sign even though we were well over an hour past our planned arrival. Our trip went exactly as planned. Our guide, Amit, was very friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and spoke very clear English. I was worried about our luggage, but Amit put us at ease, saying \"your worries are now my worries, so you can enjoy your visit\". He and Gokul took over all communication with the airport regarding my luggage and I indeed didn't have to worry about it at all. Amit delivered my luggage to the hotel soon after it arrived at the airport. This would have been very difficult for me to arrange by myself.Another major event happened during our visit. A Turkish airliner crash landed at the airport, which caused the airport to close for 4 days. Our outgoing flight to Varanasi India was cancelled and there was no indication when the airport would reopen. This is where Gokul's services really shined. He took us under his wing and informed us of several options we had of getting to India. We ended up booking an overland bus directly from Kathmandu to Varnasi. Gokul handled everything including buying the tickets, arranging for an extended stay at our hotel, and having a driver take us to the bus station and make sure we we got on the bus successfully. I don't know what we would have done without Gokul and Outshine Adventures. Through the whole trip, Gokul was always working in the background, ensuring we knew exactly what was next. He seemed to anticipate our every need before we even knew what we needed.I highly recommend Outshine Adventures for any trip to Nepal. You can rest assured that he will take care of you, even when things don't go as planned."

They arranged everything so well including our flights from Kathmandu to Pokhara and return. We were met at the airport. All connections were perfect. We had a chance to meet several guides from this organization. All were personable and professional. When we left, we felt we had made new friends. Gokul has built a top notch organization in a relatively short period of time that now includes 17 guides. (Our guide, Dambar, had to be the best.) They are worthy of their #1 ranking and I would highly recommend them. We hope to book another trip in the future to a different area - maybe Tibet or Bhutan."

I scheduled 2 private day tours and Gokul was extremely helpful in suggesting how I should spend my time. He also helped me set-up a guided Trekking tour with his staff as well. I very much enjoyed the entire planning process and most importantly the actual delivery was above my expectations.For my private tours of Kathmandu Valley, I had a fantastic guide. Bijay took me to explore so many fascinating sites around the valley. Bijay was so friendly, welcoming and his English was extremely good. I would highly recommend scheduling private tours to explore the best of the Kathmandu Valley and I strongly suggest you do so with Outshine Adventure. My trekking expedition was also amazing as it was a private one. My guide and porter were both fantastic. One of the best moments of my entire \"round the world\" trip was when both Shankar and Nabarad sang to me a Nepalese song as we trekked our way through the forrest. Just priceless!Hope you find this review helpful."

First we went by jeep and then by foot during 14 days. It was a beautifull trekking with splendid sunny wheather, beautifull snowy mountains, friendly locals and my competent guide who encouraged me when it was (sometimes) hard to climb. One day we arrived in LowerPisang. At 16.00 o' clock he asked me to come and climb to Upper Pisang. When we arrived there was a ceremony in the stupa going on: 3 monks were sitting on the floor making music by long horns and saying prayers for almost 1 hour. Tea was being served by another monk who was also busy to enlighten the candles made of yakgrease. This was very special for me to witness. What I liked very much in the mountains is the silence and the variation of the flora. That's why I have decided to visit Nepal again this year in November. This time I'm going to do the Gosainkunda and Helambu trekking with the same organisation"

Most lodges do not have ensuite bathrooms, mostly outhouses. Take as many Pepto Bismol tablets as you can carry! Lots of stomach upset and diarrhea.

Min planned my itinerary with that in mind and Mo was supportive as well as terrific company for a lone female traveller at every step.

I recommend this agency as being very reliable and they know exactly how to organize this special trekkings, as well as the standard routes.

Very very knowledgeable about the region and the history of Nepal it made the trip a lot more informative and ultimately enjoyable. Trekking was done at my pace and at no point was the trek too out of my depth.

Min was extremely informative, punctual and clear during our email correspondence. Having never done any trekking before, I had many question to ask, all of which were answered honestly and quickly. Upon arrival on Kathmandu I was collected from the airport as promised, and stayed at the wonderful Hotel Horizon. It was clean, modern and fully functional - the perfect way to begin and end my trip. Soon after arrival I was introduced to my guide who was very experienced and spoke excellent English. Before starting the trek I was fully briefed on the itinerary and the expected weather, plus my kit was checked to make sure I was suitably equipped. The organisation and attention to detail was very good indeed. The trek itself was absolutely fantastic. Besides being very fortunate with the weather, my guide and porter made the trip very enjoyable - they were humorous, fun and very knowledgeable about the mountains, plants and animals as we moved along the trek. Since I was travelling on my own, the made every effort to ensure we stayed with other travelers during the evenings, as I had requested. I was also on a relatively tight timescale, and this and all my other needs were extensively catered for. I would not hesitate to recommend Destination Himalaya. Having had the chance to speak to other tourists on the trek, Destination Himalaya were always very good value for money, very efficient and always at hand to customize the trip according to my needs."

Watching the sun rise at the end of November is always a risk as winter is coming and clouds are sometimes in the way, but the trek is a nice walk through some forestry and easy to do even if you are not an experienced walker. You will come across small villages and nice sceneries and will experience some local restaurants. The guide was nice and knowledgeable and although sometimes communication can be an issue he tried to accommodate us as much as possible. So if you have only one day for a trek, this type of walk is recommendable."

The first time we did the wunderful Manaslu Circuit as a camp trek and the second time the challenging Mera Peak climbing expedition.The Manaslu Circuit camp trek was excellent. All staff were very friendly, helpful and working hard all the time. We had a well experienced cook who made our trip successful by providing us well cooked, and important, hygienic food. Following our choice and request, Mr. Min Gurung himself guided us as during those 2 Himalaya experiences and we had such a great time, it was brilliant!The Mera Peak climbing expedition was quite challenging.

Min Gurung from destination Himalayas did a fantastic job of planning our trip for us exactly how we wanted it to be. We discussed with him online over a few weeks and he was very forthcoming with all the clarifications to my many questions. Once we reached Nepal and met Min Gurung personally, we felt at ease as we knew we could trust him completely to ensure we have a great time. All his replies were honest which is very important for us to note that as it is monsoon season there are certain things we might not be able to do. He arranged a very learned guide, Min (Sanjeev) to follow us on our initial leg of the trip. If you do want to know more about a place you are visiting, I would totally recommend you request for Min (Sanjeev) to follow you. He speaks very fluent English and is very knowledgeable about the history and various parts of the country. Min Gurung also arranged a very reliable driver, Ram to drive us to Pokhara where he had arranged Paragliding for us. That was just fantastic! TO see the lake with mountains/hills all around us. Of course we were also lucky that we had a sunny day to go for this. After a couple of days, our driver, Ram brought us for Rafting at Trisuli River which was also arranged by Min Gurung. Another fun and brilliant way to look around Nepal's nature. Overall, I would say our 1st trip to Nepal was excellent & I would definitely be back for more! & this would not have been possible without the amazing planning and arrangement of Min Gurung from Destination Himalayas! Thank you very much. Nepal is a beautiful place with beautiful people."

The first I did was Mount Everest Base Camp in 2006 and the second Manasalu circuit trek in 2013 (I visited in March 2013 but Trip Advisor won't let me go back that far) and I very much intend to return to Nepal and do another trek with Tika!Both treks were absolutely fantastic and both were made much better by the fact we were with Tika. His English is good, he is very funny and always upbeat and encouraging, making it easier to carry on during some of the harder days. We shared some wonderful times with Tika and met his lovely family. Despite suffering from mild altitude sickness on both treks I was incredibly well looked after by Tika and I honestly can't see myself trekking in the Himalaya's without him. A side point here - the treks were both absolutely stunning and had some of the most breath taking scenery I've ever encountered.The price we received was very good (although if you are on a tight budget the all inclusive food isn't a necessity if you are willing to eat Dhal Baht every day like we did and sacrifice treats like chocolate and Coca cola) and I would highly recommend booking through either Tika or the company direct, rather than booking through an agency in your home country as you will pay far more to trek with a big group! For example one agency in England charged over double the price we paid to go with a group of 14 whereas we were in a group of 2. All in all two incredible treks for a great price. Thank you Tika and thank you Destination Himalaya! See you again soon."

I did a 5 days Annapurna Himalayan circuit trek together with my younger sister and we had an amazing experience. We met Suman and Min at Destination Himalaya office and they helped us with the detail plans based on what we wanted to do, and they provided us a very great guide, Wukhu, who was really helpful and really showed a great expertise and commitment all along the trek that we went. This guy was really going above and beyond our expectations and has made everything easier for us even though this is our first experience trekking in Himalaya. I would strongly recommend the guide and of course this professional trekking agency. Thank you Destination Himalaya, for helping us to make our dream comes true.."

The service I got from Destination Hymalaya was first class. Before I got there I exchanged several emails with Min Gurung and found him very professional and thorough in the planning but also very flexible and willing to plan the trek around my abilities and my time constraints. Sailesh Bastakoti met me at the airport and was my guide for the rest of the time. He was very helpful, encouraging, and I felt very safe with him. We had to change some of our plans due to the weather but this did not stop my trek in Langtang from being one of the most memorable holidays I have ever had. However it was not all about trekking. Sailesh and his team gave me a very interesting insight into Nepali culture. It was quite an experience and I am hoping to go back trekking with Destination Hymalaya next year!"

Fantastic guide (Ganga) and support crew of porters meant that we had a great time seeing some fabulous parts of Nepal. Unfortunately the team at HSJ just made the whole experience more complicated than it needed to be through poor admin and organisation before, during and at the end of the trip which caused unnecessary stress and anxiety on many in the tour group. Office staff got travel arrangements wrong, left visas to the last minute and accepted little / no responsibility for the stress they put travellers under. and the city tour guide that they offered us for a simple tour of KTM temple monuments was the WORST city guide i have had on any tour anywhere (she lost 1/3 of the group just walking around the outside of one temple!) Thankfully the mountain guide taking us on our tour was knowledgable, humorous, welcoming and just all round great guy. But he had to do way more than his job description due to the poor office / admin by people who should know better!"

When visiting India you must put out of your mind the litter I would not necessarily say filth but litter nothing ever gets picked up it gets swept up but never collected. the Indian people because of their poorness look extremely healthy not the weight problem that effects most countries.

HSJ made this possible with a minimum of fuss! So - Mumbai it was for 3 days, in well located boutique Hotel Fariyas which is not far from the iconic Taj Hotel & surrounds. Followed by a \"wishlist\" to stay at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (aka Ravla Khempur). Although it was a fair distance from Udaipur, itself an attractive Indian city, we had an out-of-this-world hospitality from the owner + Nitin and his Team.The main tour itself was a mixture of experiences reflecting what India was all about. Our escort, Ibrahim, was quick to adapt to our humour & tricks, We hope he had an equally good time with us, albeit the inevitable challenges we gave him must have stretched his patience. I am personally eternally grateful to Mr Lovely (our driver from Delhi / Jaipur / Agra) and his trainee (Ajay) for delivering us safely to our destinations. Traffic in India is indeed hair-raising!So many forts, historical tombs, etc. to see & visit but of course the greatest of them all - the Taj Mahal, was something to behold.Varanassi was rather confronting, with rituals and ceremonies too much to comprehend.The train trip from Agra was part of the Luxury Escape package; whilst it is an adventure of sort to have done it ... strongly recommend to opt for the flight back to Delhi (at whatever cost really!!).Hard to remember the names of all our city tour guides, but thank you all the same for your interesting info's and facts.Nepal was also customised by us, and found this a slower pace than the bustle of India. Other than some confusions on our transport arrangements, Ram and his team accommodated us to the best they can. Better to get out of Kathmandu and head for Nagarkot and Pokhara. Loved our mini-trek to the Oz Camp where we had stunning views of the Annapurna Ranges and Fishtail mountain. We bonded with some Nepali college students who happily joined us in our bonfire (reciprocal Aussie hospitality, I guess!). Special TY to Dipi, Dilip, and our porters. There will always be stuff to improve on the tour organisation and choices of activities. It can be frustrating when processes are slow, but this is India and Nepal. Our group kept an open mind prior to our trip and did not assume any level of expectation ... means we had a lot of fun, even if there are dozens of holy cows always getting in our way!!!Back to home sweet home Australia (where order is the norm), with so much priceless memories.With thanks to HSJ-India / HSJ-Nepal."

Our tour consisted of rafting, visiting Chitwan national park, trekking on the Annapurna circuit for 5 days including Poon Hill, and visiting the Kathmandu valley. The experience was truly astounding! I can't ask for better tour guides, porters and travel companions. It was a short time but it feels like we'd been together for months and everyone got so close together like a family. The tour was very well organised and the guides - Binod and Ganesh were so friendly, fun, professional and always made sure that everyone was happy and healthy. Be open minded and don't have too high expectation as you're not going to stay in resorts with spa or luxurious hotels all the time. Some accommodations we stayed during the trek were very basic. However considering the conditions there, where people live on the high altitude and lack of facility, I was contented and was always fascinated by the view from our rooms. I'm glad I went on this trip and get to know about Nepal, one of the poorest countries but has people with kindest hearts. Will totally recommend Himalayan Social Journey to anyone. Thanks for the amazing experience! This is my first and won't be my last visit."

It was well organised and perfectly guided.Our trip started in Kathmandu and left for rafting after one day. The rafting was great fun as we drifted down the river. Stayed in a tent resort, which was right on the river, and was a good experience. Onto Chitwan, where we canoed, walked and rode elephants through the national park. Saw 7 endangered rhinos which was fantastic. Next was Pokhara, which was lovely and the departure point for our 5 day trek. The trek was unreal (but hardish) , porters were part of the package. Five unforgettable days of climbing into the lower Annapurnas with spectacular views along the way. The lodges were more than adequate and usually had cold beer.Returned to Kathmandu and stayed at the Gokarna Resort which was ok. But make sure they put you in the new section and not the old. This was not as good as the other ordinary hotels. Played golf here and enjoyed it. Shared the course with deer and monkeys. Also extended the massage time and it was great.Hotels on the trip were good. All air conditioned and mostly had hot water.  The trip was made very memorable by our great guide- Ram.

Booked this trip through Luxury Escapes; initially the emails sent out by HSJ were quite helpful, however as the trip drew closer emails were ignored or contradictory ,and what turned out to be blatantly untrue information was sent out.HSJ are incredibly disorganised, transport did not arrive at arranged times and after our arrival in Lukla we ended up sitting around waiting for several hours for another group to arrive ( they never did) - I'm guessing this was to try and save a few dollars by using the same set of yaks for two groups, rather than having to pay porters. Accommodation was generally of a very poor standard - mouldy rooms / mouldy curtains/ filthy bathrooms / dirty bedlinen (complete with fleas). The exceptions were Sherpaland Lodge in Namche, and Sherpa Guide Lodge in Phakding ( this place was amazing, lovely owners, spotlessly clean). Despite being told there would be a guide plus a porter for every two people, instead we had a guide plus a yak driver. With a group of twelve people, this is just foolish - there is no way one guide can keep an eye on that many people of differing levels of fitness. We ended up \"borrowing\" a porter from a group running in parallel ( a lovely 17yo guy with just a few words of English). I really felt sorry for our guide; when 4 members of our group became sick and needed to be evacuated, HSJ really didn't seem to be giving the guide sufficient support to deal with the situation.The whole operation ( especially the sleazy owner who couldn't answer any of the questions put to him at our pre-trip briefing) seems to be a bit dodgy; I'm really not sure how they managed to hook up with Luxury Escapes, as the standard of the trip really doesn't match up with the other operators who work with Luxury Escapes.My recommendation would be to give this operator a wide berth, and organise a trip yourself directly with a freelance guide - you will have much more flexibility and hopefully avoid the unhygienic accommodation!"

We had a great time in Nepal and are looking forward to booking another trip in the future. The tour covered rafting which was excellent fun, elephant safari and an early morning canoe trip in the Chitwan National park which was amazing. The trek was our first and we found it was an excellent way to try out trekking before trying a longer trip. Our guide throughout the trip was Bini who looked after us extremely well and made sure everything went smoothly. The accomodation was varied from very basic in the Tea houses on the trek to the lovely hotels in Pokhara and Chitwan. Would recommend HSJ"

We trained for 4 months, spent around $2,000 on the right gear, hopefully to ensure success. Unfortunately Social Journey Himalaya are quite disorganised so one needs to be prepared to go with the flow. In Nepal things change all the time so maybe being disorganised and not structured is a plus!! The tea houses which were used on the way to Base Camp were filthy!! I would definitely question the accommodation on the trek before booking. Because of isolation one can accept that there is no heating, no showers, no lighting at night and very basic sqat toilets. What is very difficult to get past is the filth of the facilities. In one tea house two of our team members ended up with bedbug bites . We had a wonderful Sherpa called Shree Tamang. Shree was far better, helpful, supportive and kind than the head guide for our group. Without this Sherpa I doubt if we could have made this incredibly demanding journey.Social Journey Himalaya also have a hotel in Katmandu- the Holy Himalaya. This hotel is in a great position and is clean. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Even though hot water is only available in some rooms between 6-9 it is still quite adequate. It's like a big backpackers where everyone congregates in the dining area to swap stories. I would definitely stay at the Holy Himalaya again."

We agreed to a 7am flight only to be told we weren't flying until midday. After 3 hours of arguing the helicopter company admitted they never had an available helicopter and that the tour operator OWNED the business also.After many arguments, the operator put us onto another operator and we were in the air within 15mins....!Once we arrived in the Himalayas we started to explore different restaurants in each village each night only to be told off by our guide for doing so...it turns out the operator gets the rooms for free if the guests buy food each night from teahouse. So dodgey!While our guide was \"OK\" we still streamed miles ahead of him each day and struggled with the constant fake facts that were made up on the spot. One of my favourites was \"Mt Everest View Hotel is the largest hotel in the world\". When I questioned it, he simply said \"check Guinness book of records\". He's clearly never been to Las Vegas....So overall, i need to warn future trekkers....Book it yourself! There was absolutely no upside using an operator. Just fly to Kathmandu, book a guide + sherpa online and flights to Lukla. Your guide will organise your accommodation at the teahouses. Simple."

Our group had different ages and fitness levels but Mingmar looked after everyone and made sure we all had fun, enjoyed the trek and walked as a family all the way to our destination. He was super well organized and multitasking: we never had to worry about anything, Mingmar was our guide but also our waiter, doctor and, most importantly, our friend! He was very helpful when we started feeling sick from altitude and he did his best to make us feeling better! Mingmar was always very informative of the environment around us: mountains, flora and fauna, villages, nepalese lifestyles, religion, foods. He helped us understanding the Sherpa culture and appreciate it!Our trek has been a unique experience also because of our two fabulous porters Lakpa and Pasang. While Mingmar was leading the group, Lakpa helped us in any possible way, making sure no one was left behind and that we always had all we needed. Pasang took amazing care of the two Yaks carrying our bags. Both Lakpa and Pasang were super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend a trip with Mingmar Sherpa, Lakpa and Pasang, they will be the most amazing people you can ask for during your challenging trek to EBC."

Our guide Ram and the team of wonderful porters along with our 13 travel companions got on like a house on fire - telling stories, enjoying the most beautiful panoramas, delicious momos, Everest Beer. On our five day trek we were looked after so well, Ram did everything necessary to make sure everyone was comfortable 24/7. The rafting experience was a great icebreaker for the group and we everyone gelled so well together. It might sound corny but it was like one big happy family. The variety of the trip with Chitwan, rafting, city tour, trek, Gokharna and Pokhara (where we spent an extra two days because we loved it so much, we were to spend extra days in Gokharna but 2 days is enough there) was a great mix and I can't believe how much we fitted in to our time there - it was done at a good pace. We will definitely do more experiences with HSJ. So if you're reading this review wondering whether to go ... just do it and train with some steps and hills thrown in."

I just completed the 14 day Poon Hill, Chitwan National Park and white water rafting adventure with the Himalayan Social Journey. The whole trip was an adventure with lots of variety. The trekking to Poon Hill and back to Pokhara was a beautiful experience. With any mountain trek into the Himalayas it did have lots of up hills and down dale but the views and the experience was worth it. The Nepalese are a kind and gentle people always with a smile and a helping hand. Our trip was made special by the other travellers who happened to turn up in our group and most of all by the quality of the guides and porters who looked after us every step of the way. I need to make special mention of Raju our experienced and attentive tour guide who lead a group of 9 older Australians, all well over 50 to new heights. Our porters also helped each one of us, some holding the arms of weary trekkers as they climbed at the end of the day. Rupesh carried our bag and all the while waited on us and shared his life story with us. The same can be said for Perdip, Dinesh and Rajan who each cared for one of the group along the 7 days on the mountain. Hearing their stories of life in Nepal especially since the devastating earthquake made our journey such a personal one. Special and memorable. On some evenings the guide and porters would dance to traditional Nepalese music and encourage us trekkers to do the same making for a good laugh and fun time. If you want a holiday that is fun, challenging, full of interesting sights and in a beautiful landscape then this trip ticks all the boxes. The only down side of the trip was the endless traffic due to poor roads in Nepal. If you fly and not drive to Pokhara and Chitwan then it is the perfect trip. (They say the roads will be better in a few years but until then fly). There is something magical about the resilience and positive attitude of the people of Nepal and the towering landscape of the Himalayas that make the place special. I will be back!"

Our family of 4 had the most wonderful time in Nepal with thanks to Himalayan Social Journey, and its guides and porters.

The porters were all great guys including Tikkaram who was full of energy, funny and would always go out of his way to help with so many things. Our guide in Chitwan, Narayan was also excellent at his job being able to point out animals we otherwise wouldn't have spotted and having a great knowledge of the wildlife in the park. You should go to Nepal, you should make sure that you have guides and porters because you can learn from them, you should choose Himalayan Social Journey and if you're lucky enough you'll have the same guides and porters we had.

I had booked this trip for myself and my husband last year but unfortunately we had to cancel due to the earthquake but we so wished to still visit Nepal and HSJ were kind enough to allow us to rearrange and we visited Nepal early October. Had the most fantastic experience. We were looked after from the minute we arrived at Kathmandu airport where the driver picked us up and took us to the Hotel. We found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. Following day met Ram and introduced us to our guide for the trek. Have to say what an incredible person Milan is, he is so competent and has so many great qualities, we always knew we were in safe hands, nothing was too much trouble and is great company. Have to also mention that Roopeszz our porter is such a respectful young person and also took great care of us, again nothing was too much trouble. Their job was to look after us but they went over and beyond what was expected. We took the tourist bus with Milan from Kathmandu to Pokhara which is a very long journey and from Pokhara drove for about an hour to begin our trek. HSJ does specify that to enjoy the trek it's best to prepare yourself with uphill climbing beforehand, I believed that by regular walking and running would be enough but it isn't. To enjoy the trek, it's best to prepare with a good level of hill walking and as we didn't we found it hard but nonetheless was fantastic journey. Nepal is simply beautiful.All the activities we did were simply fantastic, white water rafting was great fun, Chitwan National park with the elephant ride, jungle walk, canoe ride was awesome.Was a totally fascinating experience made possible by our wonderful guide Milan and Roopeszz our porter. So just want to say thank you HSJ for the opportunity given to us for a holiday of a lifetime and recommend anyone to experience this amazing holiday. You will not be disappointed."

We had some extra days before and after the trip and HSJ was able to accommodate all our needs. HSJ has promoted heavily though Luxury Escapes, and their schedule was very busy when we arrived. This was somewhat problematic, as it appeared we were going to have to move to a different start date. It was sorted out to our satisfaction in the end. Binod provided good communication prior to the trek. Bishnu Basnet was our guide, and a better guide can not be found. He cared for all of us in an amazing way. We became a family and all successfully completed the trek under Bishnu's careful guidance. I'm not going to say everything was seamless, and the organization by HSJ was not perfect. There was some errors by them along them along the way. I largely thought it was due to communication problems at a higher level in the organization, combined with it being a very busy season. That said, it is Nepal, and one often has to accept things happen a certain way in Nepal. If you can't deal with 'Nepal Time' then maybe go elsewhere. It is also a measure of a company that they acknowledge their errors and overcome any obstacles. HSJ did so every time. Overall, it's a five star experience, and HSJ try to do all they can to ensure you get all 5 stars. "

When the opportunity arose to travel to Everest Base Camp with Himalayan Social Journey we were hesitant and did a fair bit of research into the company, structure of the trek and read lots of reviews. In the end we decided to give it a go. Altitude is a great leveller. You can be as fit as you like but unless you prepare both mentally and physically and have the right equipment you will struggle. This trek has a lot of uphill, downhill, rough ground, wind, cold, rain and throw in lack of oxygen above 3000m, well, discomfort.We got lucky. Our guide Bishnu, was informative and professional. He was constantly monitoring the group and advising on what and when was happening. He was also very experienced in Himalayan Trekking and understood altitude sickness and how to deal with it. Our group had prepared correctly and everyone understood what needed to be done to get up and down from EBC. The program for our group worked well. There was the right pace, correct rest periods and the food was adequate. If you are after five star accomodation then that is not going to happen on this trek. The accomodation is basic but allows you to prepare for the next day.The flights to Lukla are totally dependent on weather situations. If it is cloudy there will be no flights. You may lose a day either side of your trek because of this so you need to have a buffer in your travel plans and good insurance.Make sure you have a solar battery charger or a couple of charged battery packs. Once you get above Namchee Bazaar you will have to pay a fair bit to get devices charged. Water purification is essential. Get a Ultra Violet wand or water purification tablets and try them before you leave to get used to the taste. Merino will be you best friend. It is warm and keeps the smell away. Spend the money on a merino buff. The cold air will hurt your throat and the buff keeps your breath moist and face warm.Prepare to climb and descend. You may need to consult a fitness professional or a trekking organisation to fully understand how to do this. The literature that comes with the H.S.J. Trekking information suggests that you may not have to train at all. Not true. You need to be able to walk up and down rough tracks in hiking boots with a pack on your back whilst keeping hydrated for up to six hours with breaks. If you have trouble doing that at sea level then you will need to train until you are comfortable.The rescue helicopters do a roaring trade in trekking season. For example in a group of Brits who were trekking on a similar schedule, they lost five out of ten at Gorak Shep. The HSJ group in front of us lost two. All were evacuated to Lukla or Kathmandu. Each day there was a procession of rescues.If you have access to an altitude training room near you, try it. It is a great confidence booster and most of the people who run them are seasoned trekkers who are willing to help.This trek was great for us. We got clear weather, uninterrupted flights, good guiding staff and more importantly, a committed and well prepared group of people who bonded well and supported each other."

Thanks to our guide KB, our trekking pace was just right and we learnt so much.Our Jungle experience also great. Our guide Hari had us running through the jungle to see a rhino in the river and listening and viewing so much of nature. He shared his knowlege. I can't wait to return to Nepal"

Guide GANGA ( Brother from another Mother !) was so informative and caring and made the journey seem easy. Ganga's attention to detail made our time so enjoyable. Bishnu and Tengee were also super helpful and we had a great time with these guys too.Despite bad weather creating a disjointed start to our trek (some of the party in Lukla and others left in KTM), HSJ managed to get all 16 of us on the mountain together from Naamche Bazaar onwards. And though we were initially concerned with travelling in such a large group, it was FANTASTIC! Great people who made the experience once in a lifetime and memorable for us. Accommodation is mostly basic but with some lovely spots added to the mix to keep our precious Western needs met (Gokarna at the end of the trip was beautiful). Totally awe inspiring experience and seriously not too hard (yet challenging at times).We highly recommend Himalayan Social Journey and especially Guide Ganga. This trip was a bucket list tick for us!"

Ram was more than happy to allow us to change our plans and go to Chitwan first. We did 2 nights, 3 days down there and the guide, the hotel and the activities were outstanding. Everyone was so organized, accommodating and knowledgeable. When we headed off the EBC the second time, weather was great and we got to Lulka first go. Mingmar, our guide, really made the trip. Having grown up along the trek he knew so much about the area, the culture and the route. He literally could tell us exactly how long each section would take.Our group had differing levels of fitness and effects of sickness along the way and he was so attentive to each of us. He really made sure we were all going to have a successful trek and all make it to base camp.If anyone is thinking of going trekking in Nepal I could not recommend Mingmar enough. He was kind, he made sure everything was looked after, he would joke with us - he made the trip enjoyable.The whole experience with HSJ was great, from the initial contact of booking the trip, to Dilep and the other drivers, to the staff in the hotels - it was such an easy and well planned trip. Highly recommended! I will be back in the future and will be using HSJ."

We used Himalayan Social Journey for a fortnight's trip to Nepal, on the recommendation of our daughter, who had done a brief trek with them two years ago. We were not disappointed! From the moment of booking, Ram kept in touch and answered all my questions about our trip, booking an extra night in a hotel on our arrival and arranging a flight to Everest. Nothing was too much trouble for Ram and this was the case for all the staff of Himalayan Social Journey. We did five days' trekking in the Annapurnan foothills and our guide, Bishnu Bhattarai, was absolutely superb. He was full of information about Nepal and the places we were visiting and was unfailingly cheerful and full of energy. Our assistant guide, Tikkaram, was super helpful and went out of his way to help us. Our porters carried our loads with ease and provided great entertainment in the evenings at our tea houses, singing and dancing for us (and getting us up to dance as well! I won't forget Bishnu's dance moves in a hurry!). The trip combined some time in Kathmandu, white water rafting, safari in Chitwan, trekking in beautiful mountain landscape and some rest and relaxation in Pokhara. Throughout the whole trip we were looked after superbly and learned a lot about this beautiful country and its wonderful people. The whole trip ran like clockwork (apart from the road network, which is outside anyone's control!) and nothing was too much trouble for Bishnu and our team of porters. I whole heartedly recommend Himalayan Social Journey to anyone who wants to explore the amazing country that is Nepal, a country that you can't only visit once. Thanks to Ram and his team for making our trip so special."

I first saw Himalayan Social journey on Groupon but went on their website and found the 9N/10D Kathmandu - Pokhara Tour and Trekking with two night Luxury 5 Star Accommodation (4*/5* Accommodation). I added on an extra day ($45 hotel), Everest flight ($220), a sightseeing trip to Bhaktapur ($30), rafting ($35), paragliding ($100), private driver to Pokhara ($70) and added on the single supplement ($350)- all $ are usd. I booked in February and the email communication with Ram was responded to fast with clear information. Pick up at airport was easy (go outside and look for sign in the throng of people across the road). I was taken to the office to pay, exchange currency (great rate) and then get a SIM card on way to Hotel Holy Himalaya (great location and breakfast but terrible shower, no restaurant - try Gaia at the top of the street). The tour went ahead even though I was the only person. I got to do all of my activities and a cooking class ($A50) which was very lucky considering the weather.Please keep in mind that Nepal is a developing country and roads, traffic, language and culture is very different to your home country. Traffic in Thamel is crazy (cars, trucks, buses, trucks, tuk tuk's, cows, dogs, motorbikes and pedestrians all sharing bumpy dirt roads). I learnt to be patient and go along with what was transpiring, insist on the itinerary being honoured, pay extra at times (for guides, a bag - duffle bag not available, taxis) and everything turned out in the end (it was stressful at times though, especially when told flights, sightseeing, accommodation, massages won't go ahead as stated on the itinerary, however this did get sorted eventually).Rafting was fun but was told it was a 2 hour bus ride and 4 hour rafting. But was a 4 hour bus ride and 2 hour rafting. You get very muddy so make sure you keep a change of cloths handy to change at the end (there is no shower). The Mount Kailash Hotel in Pokara was very plush and had a great overhead shower and well priced restaurant. Pokhara is much quieter than Thamel. The guides and drivers were very good. The trek was fun and Ganesh my guide was very helpful and attentive. The walk to Dhampus is 3 hours of slate stair climbing, which was taxing on the legs. We walked through villages, past schools, fabulous mountain peak views and through forest (done leeches). The accommodation on the trek (Hotel Greenland in Dhampus, Australian Guesthouse at Australian Camp and Hotel Mountain Garden at Sarangkot all had an ensuite) add on 100npr for each shower (even if cold at Sarangkot) and 100npr for wifi, which will only be working when power is on). You order all meals through the guide and pay before leaving. Definitely give the paragliding a go, you will experience what it is like to be an eagle. September was quite warm and I only needed a jumper on one night. If taking the flight from Pokhara to Katmandu get a seat on the left side (is free seating) for a view of Mount Everest Range. The Gonkarna Rainforest Resort is about 30 -60 mins out of Thamel depending on traffic. It is a nice resort but is in need of a refurb. Monkeys are around in the morning and you can hear them in the trees at night. Try the yoga on the rooftop, Uma was fantastic. Overall I had a great trip but you need to be tolerant. If you are short on time I would definitely recommend this tour. I had a trip full of great memories. Make sure you have your itinerary on you to verify what is supposed to happen. It is a good idea to download Thamel and Pokhara maps to your smartphone, to help you find your way around. "

We booked a 14night Poon Hill (Annapurna ranges) trek with 2 night Gokarna Forest stay with this company and I cannot speak more highly of our guide Raju and his team of 4 porters, Tikarum in particular. My husband, 15yo daughter and myself felt that we had done enough physical training (me less so) but I will say this is not an entry level trek by Australian standards. I struggled on day 2 - there are alot of slate stairs of varying heights (9000 in one day) which at this time of year after monsoon can be slippery and treacherous. Having said that, the compassion and kindness shown to me by Raju really did bring me to tears (I was also sick, dehydrated and suffering mild altitude sickness as well but that's another story!) Both Raju and Tikarum were there patiently beside me waiting to steady the slightest stumble and I cannot thank them enough. Food along the trek is surprisingly western (roast potato, pizza etc) and some of the tea house accom is a little.....agricultural, but that is all part of the fun. If travelling during Sept you will need very little in the way of warm clothes and thermals definately not needed. We were certainly not prepared for the warm weather walking through the mountains - tshirts and shorts (covering the thighs) are adequate. Watch out for leeches and mosquito's and bring antiseptic, anti itch cream and most definately sunscreen. Breathtaking views are the reward for your gard work!If there is a criticism, it is of the front end organisation. Emails from Australia were always answered promptly however once in Nepal we found that communication was lacking. Messages were often left to guiding staff to pass on and sort out where this clearly was an admin job that should be sorted at the end of the trek. I'm referring specifically to incorrect requests for payments that had already been paid however no receipts were ever given so check and recheck and always get a receipt. As a side note, the guide and porters rely on tips to support their meagre pay packets so leave your stingy pants at home and support these guys - they are worth every cent!"

One of our group was extremely ill and he lead her through three really tough days getting her safe and sound to the next guesthouse. And our porters .... Incredible men - always smiling, nothing too much trouble - just wonderful. The only feedback I would provide is around communication during the trek itself - yes, sometimes things got lot in translation but it would be good to have a clear idea of what the day ahead will bring. I also think that having to pay for hot showers and electricity on top of what we already paid is unrealistic. Yes, it's only a dollar or two, but the tour price should include all of this. That notwithstanding, we had a wonderful trip and one that will stay with us for a lifetime. And, if we ever to forget, the photos of the Annapurna ranges will be there to remind us ....

We did a 12 day Katmandu, Pokhara and Poon Hill trek, first of all we would like to thank Ram for answering all of our question and helping us to fine tune our trip so that all went smoothly. We were picked up at the airport in Kathmandu without any fuss and taken to the office to meet with Ram and he explained some of the details of our trip and that we would be meeting our tour guide Narendra Timalsina. We meet later that evening for a cultural dinner and he explained that he would be our guide for the trek and we were pleased to hear that he had many years experience trekking around Nepal. and we knew we would be in good hands. He told us that our porter would be Roopeszz Crest and he would be joining us in Pokhara the following morning. The next morning we meet with Roopeszz and found him to be a great young man with a big smile and great sense of humour.We began our trip after breakfast by catching the tourist bus to Pokhara and spent the night in Pokhara at a very nice hotel they choose for us \"Splendid View Hotel\" before leaving on a 90 minute mini van drive to Naya Pul the next morning where we began our trek. The first day was to be a 7 Klm trek to Tikhedhunga which was mostly uphill and through local villages, we stayed overnight at the \"Shankar Guest House\". The guesthouse was clean and basic with shared facilities. The following morning day 2, after breakfast we trekked to Ghorepani rather long day of all uphill trekking doing the famous 3280 stairs in the first 2 hours followed by even more stairs and a walk of some 13.4 Klm. Our guide Narendra always ensured that each rest stop had magnificent views tonight he booked us into the \"Nice Viewpoint Lodge\" great location youth hostel feel basic/clean with superb views we were not disappointed. Day 3 we were up early to walk the 45 to 60 minute walk up another 450 mtrs and yes more stairs to Poon Hill for a stunning sunrise and so worth it, take a warm jacket and buy a coffee at the top the views were magnificent, stunning and utterly amazing to see the beautiful Himalayans. Returned back to Lodge for breakfast before setting off again to trek through some stunning rainforests before arriving at Tadapani where we stayed at the \"Hotel Magnificent \" which served the best spring rolls. Day 4 we left Tadapani for Landruk stoping at Ghandruk and viewing the Visitors Centre which was very informative before descending to the valley floor more steps down this time before winding our way up the other side and yes more stairs, lots more stairs, again Narendra had booked us into a very nice hotel \"Super View Guesthouse \" this local couple were very friendly and have prime real estate allowing views up and down the valley most defiantly a place to stop and some rooms have private facilities.Day 5 we made our way to Pothana easier walking today but still the views keep on coming the accomodation was very limited Pothana showed you magnificent views of \"Fishtail\" Day 6 we walk on to Phedi which was all downhill, remember take your trekking poles,the Nepal people have a saying \"a little bit up, a little bit down\" and nothing could be truer.Our guide was knowledgeable, informative, courteous and very polite and he was always patient and gave us encouragement when we needed it. Our porter Roopeszz was a very polite young man and always had a smile every day. He always had our bags in our room by the time we arrived at the hotel. Both guide and porter are a credit to Himalayan Social Journey.Himalayan Social Journey are the company you should consider when thinking of doing any trekking in and around Nepal"

Unfortunately a dear friend of mine became ill along the way and altitude sickness set in causing her to have to turn around. Our leader Binny stayed by her side, hand in hand to safer territory until she was collected by chopper and taken to hospital. While Binny was away, Dipak had to step up and lead our crew for the top end of the journey. With the support of Shaila (our very own yak man) they got the rest of us safety to Base Camp for an incredible afternoon. What a journey, what a personal achievement, and what a beautiful bunch of people we had to share this journey with. Thanks guys. You truly are a tremendous team!!"

Since this trek is in a remote area and less-known than some other more common treks, its easy to have changes in the schedule and some unexpected situations. Milan handled everything in the best possible way. We were also very thankful for our porter Pradeep who was always very kind and helpful to us. This is our second trek with Himalayan Social Journey and we definitely recommend their services 100%. We felt it was great value for our money and in general had a fantastic experience."

The guide who took us was Mingmar Sherpa and he was wonderful! Our group had different walking speeds but he always looked out for everyone and made sure everyone was walking at a good pace for themselves. With altitude sickness being very common he also made sure we were very open and honest about how we were feeling so we could keep ourselves healthy. Mingmar was always happy to help and was very informative of the flora, forna and mountains. He was also able to explain about the traditional Nepalese ways as well as the origins of names, traditional foods/baking/relationships. We really learned an awful lot about the Himalayan way of life and this made our experience even richer! I would definitely recommend a trip with Mingmar as your guide and I honestly cannot think of a more honest and caring person to help you through the difficult trek."

We had a big group and I was the youngest in the group and by myself but I never felt alone with these guys. Bishnu was great at translating to english and made sure everyone was informed and taken care of. I had lots of fun with Bishnu, having a drink when it was over and many laughs throughout the trek. Ganga is one of the most fit people I have ever meet and the passion he has for he's County and culture is astonishing. You can feel at ease that anything you need will be attended to even if he has to carry you down or up or just bring you a hot cup of tea for your throat. ( Bring lozenges ;) )Both Bishnu and Ganga are highly experienced and have a wealth full of knowledge in there heads about the culture of the lands, it's traditions the heart and soul of their country. The company was excellent in accommodating any changes and needs of each and every member of my trek, I could not recommend them high enough. I even booked a second trip while I was there because there quality for price was so good. The beginning starts with a tour of the nearby tourist attractions for free but you will need to pay the entrance fee which is $2- $15 depending on where you want to go but if you simply want to explore than you are free to or want to leave early they will organise a taxi or bus to take you where to go and negotiate price on your behalf. Again I have to mention Ganga and Bishnu if possible to ask for them as your tour guides as you will not be in more safer, experienced, caring and knowledgeable hands. A tip is expected at the end but not mandatory but these guys deserve it and don't be stingy"

The views, when tbe clouds lifted, are as to be expected-inspiring.The first night out of Pokara was fun, nice place to stay & great views. The same for the final night out.The longest day, while interesting re the people and sights unfortunately, due to Pokara and surrounds expansion for tourism,! was a day largely looking at road works.Accomodation was fine other than the final night in Pokara. This is a nice trip & gives you a feel for Nepal,especially if time is an issue or looking for an easy wander."

We completed the 14 day trip with Himalayan social in June 2015 and have raved about it ever since! Other than the fabulous scenery, the fantastic raft trip, the lovely food - our outstanding memory is of our guide Ganga. He played the role of tutor of the Nepalese culture and flora and fauna, general trek guide, mountain trek guide, waiter, first aider, friend, accountant and much much more! He is knowledgeable, approachable and we felt safe and confident in his abilities. The 5 stars awarded this trip goes to him. We had a mixed group of different ages and this worked for the group dynamic. You require a moderate level of fitness for the trek but we found it extremely enjoyable and rewarding. The organisation of the company was very good and they arranged accommodation before and after the trip in a decent hotel. The trip contains a variety of highlights of Nepal and would definitely recommend it."

(This post was posted earlier and unknowingly removed without notice)Although we enjoyed our Nepal trip (thanks to the beautiful nature and our wonderful guides/porters), the experience with HSJ was not entirely pleasant.The tour package is not recommended for those who may want to make changes to the itinerary as deviations (as suggested by HSJ before you embark on the journey) are costly. Not all exclusions (e.g. entrance fees to sightseeing places) are stated clearly and actual charges could be higher than quoted (e.g. we were told 3 different prices for optional flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu while we were in Nepal). Our poor guide has to work while he's unwell as there's no replacement. And our portals worked harder to double up as impromptu guide instead.Consider HSJ only if you stick to the original itinerary, are willing to pay high extra costs, and don't mind compromises due to unforeseen circumstances."

We stayed in warm, comfortable Homestays often with our own bathroom! quaint and colourful and very welcoming. Evenings often brought conversation, card playing and always a discussion reviewing the day and considering tomorrow.....plans, needs and expectations made clear all round. Two females in our 50s, of moderate fitness we worked hard on those climbs up and down and felt satisfied that we had had a go at something tough but achievable. Up at 4am to climb Poon Hill, having the clouds clear and viewing the incredible peaks, late rhododendrons' s still in flower, a carpet of pink petals. We ate well, enjoying the local fare, discovered particularly good apple pies, drank satisfying masala tea. We shared the paths of small mountain ponies and goats. We walked respectfully through people lives and homes, some acknowledged us some did not, and that felt right. An enlightening experience, I thoroughly recommend this journey and felt our time and money was extremely well spent with our wise and competent guide Prakash and our porter, Purna. Many thanks."

We were underprepared for the physical challenge of this trek however we survived and feel a high sense of satisfaction that we completed it.

The magnificent green everywhere of the forests and rice paddys. Not to mention the spectacular mountains. Another bonus for travelling at this time of year is that there are far less tourists and you can make some last minute decisions such as deciding on booking the Scenic Everest flight changing to private transfers etc. Himalayan Social Journey's team were great with correspondence before we arrived in Nepal and then we're brilliant in every way throughout our tour. From the driver Arjun who had the very difficult task of keeping us safe on the very difficult roads to Chituan and Pokhara, to our porters Rupus and Pradip who not only carried our belongings but also kept us upright at times on slippery steps and last but not least our most wonderful guide BINOD who supported us and kept us safe throughout this incredible journey.

Our guides were Binod and Raju and they were great. One of the kids ended up sick and could not trek with us, so Binod organised for a porter to stay at Pokerah and bring them up when he was well enough and we met up at the halfway point. When we ended up wanting to walk longer on the last day and cut the trek shorter, Binod just sorted it. While we of course had to pay for the extra accommodation, Binod and Rjau just sorted anything that arose, or we raised, easily. The itinerary allowed plenty of Kathmandu exploration both guided and independent. The standard of accommodation ranged from exceptional to good. Everyone we came across in Nepal was friendly and the team at Himalayan Social Journey was no different. This time of year was monsoon season however the weather was exceptional."

My trek was in October 2015. I did not buy any package tour, basically I asked for a porter and a guide. The tourists are promised a lot in the emails and orientation by the agency. For example, I was promised to get a tourist bus, an English speaking guide, a sleeping bag and trekking poles among others.Although I did not really want having a city tour, the agency nevertheless inserted this trip into my 12 day trek. That is why my trek consisted of 9 days only or may be even less.... In reality, the city tour turned out to be a disaster. The so called city tour guide was very unprofessional and kept asking me personal questions which were intimidating (my salary, hotel price, etc). I got little information about Nepal and the history, but I heard a lot on the guide's political views about the politics in my country instead. He showed me only 20-30 percent of each place as he was in hurry. Honestly, this old man just ruined my morning. He did not hesitate to ask for tips. Those who work, deserves to be rewarded.Second, I was not provided with trekking poles but was given two bamboo sticks by the mountain guide, which were very inconvenient. The sleeping bag that I was given did not look very clean, do they wash it before a new trek? I had been asked to send a copy of my passport for TIMS and permits a month in advance, which I did. Yet, nobody had ever told me that I should bring a few photos with me for these documents (but thanx to forums with lots of info!). So, till the early morning before the departure on trek, my TIMS and permits were not prepared, the bus tickets were not bought. After a city tour Ram explained me in the office that it was the duty of the mountain guide and he came back from another trek in the late evening before departure! I had a wonderful night full of doubts. Unbelievable! And so many ppl staying in the office. Nex morning, I received a message from a mountain guide at 6 a.m. that he would pick me up in 30 minutes!!! Moreover, there was no tourist bus as I had to use local bus and sit at the back. Did you know how many people die as a result of bus accidents per month in Nepal? All these local buses are overcrowded and drivers drive very aggressively! HSJ showed a little regard to my safety. So we drove in the local bus at the beginning and at the end of trek which took in total 2 days. Guide and porter were not doing anything special in the bus so why should they be paid a full price?Mountain guide' English level was very very low. Basically, they provided me with a porter at the guide\u2019s price. His main duty was to bring me from one lodge to another and take a food order. He never let me pay directly to the lodge owner for food and room. Moreover, the people provided by the agency (guide and porter) never had a medical kit, they had no proper walking shoes and only 1 pair of warm gloves for 2 people (no towels, no sleeping bags, etc.). Oh, yes, they had green polo shirts with HSJ logo. I also got one. The locals always cough and sneeze. I asked some questions concerning safety and well-being and I received an answer \u201cWe are used to\u201d. So if I would have a health issue he would just go to lodge (2-3h walking) and call to the agency because his phone was always off (no money on sim card after many calls to his family). They were entertaining, positive and kind young people, but on 4000m attitudes I need knowledge, experience and equipment because it is not a journey to Disneyland. So this agency is exploiting the personnel, treating them like slaves and cheating on tourists. Do you want to support the schemes of unfair personnel treatment?Also, on orientation with Ram (the one who answers emails) I added 2 more days for trekking route and then I had paid for a private car $65 in advance to go back to Kathmandu but the agency cancelled it just a few hours before the trip due to the \u201cfuel crisis\u201d. Instead I had to use local bus which was a highly unpleasant experience, believe me, and especially because I had to stay on the roof top and watch my bags. I was compensated for a private car lately in the office, but nobody picked me up from the bus stop.I would suggest to HSJ to invest into their personnel like language classes as well as equipment and a first aid kit, so they don\u2019t look discreditable in front of trekkers. I am not providing HSJ with my personal details as it is none of their business. I told at the end of my trip to Mr. Sapkota what I think about them, however, I was still pushed to write a 5 star review. And I am sure that every new review from now will include few words how professional those folks are.Well, Nepal is a beautiful place with lots of sites to see and exciting moments to experience. But do not deal with the agency! They will ruin your impressions of the country. Logistics was a disaster. Thus, what is the point to pay to the agency when you can arrange everything yourself for much less money and with a much better experience. Just take a satellite phone for emergency use and be ready to bargain in the lodges."

They are very well-organised, professional, but at the same time - quite friendly. As a lone traveler, I felt welcomed, and then - rather spoiled by the choice of activities. Having a tour guide in Nepal is quite useful, even if you love being on your own - public transport could be tricky and in the mountains you'd get better service everywhere. Our guide Ram was very knowledgeable and made sure we had a good time during the Annapurna Ghorepani-Poonhill trek in may 2016."

Sure there was a very detailed itinerary given but being a novice to the world of trekking left us slightly worried. I am so pleased to say that from the minute we landed in Nepal we had an absolutely fabulous time. We were guided through the manic streets of Kathmandu, Pokhara and the magnificent Himalayan mountains by our trusted guide Binod and his team. The trek was hard at times but the feeling of achievement you get once you've reached the top is wonderful and knowing you can take your time, whether it's just to soak up the scenery or take a breather is comforting.The whole experience was wonderful and would fully recommend Himalayan Social Journey to anyone wanting to see and experience the wonderful little treasure that is Nepal."

            "review": "highly recommended travel agency. I started out planning our trip to Nepal with a well-known international agency. I soon felt that I was being pushed into more than I wanted, both financially and as to tone of the trip. I wanted a relaxed trip but one that would allow us to see a lot but also with the flexibility that would permit changes if needed. I also wanted my money to go into the hands of local Nepalese, not a distance agency. Himalayan Social Journey was just that. i suspect that their main business is with trekkers as that is what draws many to Nepal. However, as aging travelers, they were able to accommodate our needs as well. We worked out the basic itinerary and hotels that I suggested i advance so had the main features of our stay defined. However, modifications due to flight schedule changes and personal requests were quickly worked into the mix. We had a great driver , Dilip, with good vehicles for all our travels. That included driving for hours on the main, but very narrow congested roads. Fly when you can as the roads are really bad. Our guides in Kathmandu were very good. They were knowledgable, friendly, and very good about judging our interests and pace. The resort in Chitwan was first rate, The guide in Pokhara was young and somewhat shy about speaking English but was able to adequately show us the relatively few sights of interest in that city. I certainly would recommend this travel agency for somewhat independent travelers who feel they do not have to have their hands held throughout but still want the services of a competent team. Thanks Ram for being so flexible and for interpreting and handling our needs so well."

The agency promised point to point transit via deluxe tour coach but on our arrival in Kathmandu, the Managing Director Mr Ram Sapkota told us that he arranged local bus for us for one of the transits and encouraged us to pay US$75 to arrange a private van instead since deluxe bus is not available for whatever reasons. Mr Ram told us a local bus ride is an extremely uncomfortable ride and we may reach our destination late. To me, this is the agency's oversight but Mr Ram is insistent that we shld bear half the additional cost in a private van. This is almost like a blackmail to me in the first day of my Nepal trip and i offered to pay US$25 instead which he rejected. I had to give him a dressing down there and then. I told him that I was very upset cos of his service attitude, he had no intention of making good his agency's oversight and had the cheek to tell me to enjoy my local bus ride. I followed up by telling him that if I have to go to the local bus station and board a local bus in Nepal, why do I need to pay such exorbitant fees to book his agency for the land tour? There was little room for negotiation and Mr Ram just kept quiet. Eventually at the end of the 10 days Mr Ram compensated me and my friends for taking the local bus instead of the promised deluxe bus ride. But of cos i had to make my unhappiness very clear before he compensated me and my friends.One should be very careful dealing with Mr Ram Sapkota as additional costs might arise even if due to the tour agency's oversight. Or when he tries to suggest alternative lodging or tour itinerary, chances are it might be a rip off."

I recently just returned from a once in a lifetime experience to Everest Base Camp with a group of friends with the amazing help of the Himalayan Social Journey company. We had originally had seen the offer in Groupon but had wanted a different length of time for our specific group. Throughout the process they had maintained excellent contact with our one friend that organized this adventure and kept us posted about what to pack and to expect. Mind you, as much advise anyone gives you I'm not sure how well it would prepare you for this kind of trip. We were met at the airport by the driver and guide for the trek all the way to Base Camp and back. They even went above and beyond because our group came at different times and still picked us all up at our requested time frames with no hassle. During the trek we were accompanied by Shankar, Tengee, and three porters. Shankar and Tengee were excellent from beginning to end. They ensured our safety throughout the trek. Shankar debriefed us on a daily basis on what to expect in the days ahead and gave us advise on how to ensure our success to base camp as a group. Not sure if we would have all made it to base camp without them. We had a great experience with this group, their hospitality in each of the tea houses as well made this adventure even more memorable. Serious props to all the porters out there because that is one hard job to do and they make it look easy! At the end of this trek they were no longer just dedicated, knowledgeable tour guides but also our friends. Highly recommend this company and these specific people mentioned in this review!

Our support in Kathmandu was perfect, offering honest suggestions and totally reliable.

Our tour began in Nepal where we experienced Kathmandu, Chitwan National Park, whitewater rafting, Pokhara, the wonderful trek to Poon Hill back to Kathmandu and lots more in between! Huge thanks to Ram (the big boss) for making us feel like we were the only ones he needed to look after. From the beginning of our holiday planning Ram was a pleasure to deal with, ensuring that we felt at ease with all our tour requirements including extra nights accommodation and additional experiences. Nothing was too much trouble! A huge thank you must also go to the wonderful Ram Chandra, our fantastic and knowledgeable guide who ensured that we all got there safely, and our amazing porters! You all looked after us so well and made our visit to Nepal very special. HSJ also organised our nine day tour of India through Abyss Tours. Everything was organised exactly how we wanted it. Our private driver Jay was a fountain of knowledge and his driving was amazing. Our tour of the Golden Triangle, including Ranthambore National Park, was a wonderful experience. We even got to see a tiger! Private guides had been arranged for us for our tours of Jaipur and Agra. Ali and Raj were amazing and really knew their stuff! Our experience of these cities would not have been the same without them.Thank you to everyone at HSJ! You gave us an experience in Nepal and India that we will never forget!! :):)"

We've just come back from our 2nd visit to Nepal with HSJ and found everything to be just as good as the first time, from the time they pick you up at the airport to the time they drop you back there nothing is too much trouble and you don't have to worry about anything. This trip we did Everest Base camp which was a bit ambitious at our age but Ganga, our guide, and our porter Bire were brilliant and made sure we got there and we wouldn't have made it to the top of Kala Patthar without them. This was the hardest thing I've ever done but I'm so glad I did it as the scenery was magnificent and spectacular, If you fancy visiting Nepal it is such a beautiful country and the people are lovely and they need tourists, there are easier treks and tours than the one we did but if we come back again we would definitely use Himalayan social journey and especially Ganga who couldn't have done any more for us. Thanks to you all for everything."

Our experience was made most enjoyable and hassle free right from the beginning. Booking with Ram was an absolute pleasure, taking the time to answer directly any questions we had regarding the tour. We were greeted on arrival in Kathmandu by our guide Binod and what a bloke he was! From sight seeing in Kathmandu, Chitwan and Pokhara to trekking though the Himalaya's, Binod could not have been a lovelier, more accommodating guide. Large amounts of credit must also go to our porters Rupus and Godess (forgive our spelling if wrong!) who for our 6 Day Annapurna trek were nothing short of amazing, two lovely blokes that made the trek even more enjoyable, sharing a good sense of humour and imparting there local knowledge along the way.This really was a truly local Nepalese experience. Whilst the whole trip was well planned and catered for with comfortable accommodation, we never once felt like we were part of a large tour group. It felt more like Binod as our friend had decided to take us for an adventure, showing us his favourite parts of the country. Everything was personalised and special mention must go to Binod for catering the experience to our various needs and abilities. We couldn't recommend the trek with HSJ highly enough. It was an unforgettable experience and one we are looking to do again!"

It was also the second time that we had the pleasure of being looked after by Ganga. He actually arranged the entire trip for us as we had kept in touch following our previous visit. He is an amazing guide: knowledgeable, attentive, friendly, accommodating and fun.We knew what to expect from Nepal and HSJ - and neither disappointed. Do not come here expecting a 4 or 5 star hotel to be on a par with the West - unless you stay in the Hyatt or similar. 'Luxury' in Nepal does not have the same meaning but you will get a comfortable, clean room with ensuite facilities for around \u00a325-\u00a335 per room per night b&b. We stayed at the Holy Himalaya Hotel in Kathmandu before and after our trek (part of HSJ) and apart from a cold shower on the morning before we flew to Lukla we had no issues at all. The staff are lovely: special mention should go to the waiter Druber (not sure if that is spelled correctly!) who looked after us every time we sat in the lounge/bar area.I have written a separate review of the EBC trek and Nepal in general which I hope you will read and be inspired to visit this lovely country."

Before i booked this trip, i read few reviews about Himalayan Social Journey; mostly they were great reviews but what got my attention was one review that mentioned little criticism and Ram (CEO HSJ) amazingly took the time to respond to every little point mentioned in that review in a very professional yet friendly manner. i knew then i was dealing with a highly organized team. We were looking at the 14 days Annapurna trekking but we could only do 12 days due to vacation limit.. so i emailed Ram and i was surprised by his swift feedback to accommodate all our needs to squeeze all activities in those 12 days and he hired us our own trekking guide & porter that will go far and beyond to make sure you are having the best experience. we squeezed 6 days of trekking in just 4.i would also like to mention that with Himalayan Social Journey, you get very high quality experience of Nepal including quality of the team members very polite & well educated, their business partners for certain activities i.e rafting ,jungle safari, canoeing...etc. the guest houses they pick for sleep over they all take the extra step to make sure that HSJ guests are content versus any other touring company in Nepal - we could definitely sense the respect toward HSJ everywhere we went in Nepal.we were very Lucky to Have Raj as our guide Ramhori as our porter i know we got you guys exhausted in our trekking adventure but the memories will be engraved in our heart.we are definitely coming back for another himalayan adventure with the best touring team out thereThank you for all your efforts to make our experience spectacular"

The guide and the porters were fantastic. Obliging, friendly and a great source of local knowledge. The accommodation, sometimes basic, was clean and comfortable on the trek. The scenery stunning ... so close to the ice capped mountains. The activities included in the trip were varied and well spread out. White water rafting was a hoot, and the Chitwan wildlife encounters ... crocodiles, deer, wild boar, birdlife, monkeys and the elephants were all memorable. The trekking is not for the faint hearted or unfit, but it is an experience not to be missed. The food on the trek was tasty and cheap. Pokhara was delightful. A contrast to bustling Kathmandu and easy to shop for gifts, with lakeside shops and restaurants. The boat ride on the lake was fun too. The road trip to Chitwan was long and dusty, but this will be less onerous when the road reconstruction is complete. The hotel accommodation in Kathmandu at the beginning and end of the trip, and in Chitwan and Pokhara were comfortable and safe and well located. The pool at th ened of the trek in Pokhara was very welcome. The company, Himalayan Social Journey, was very easy to communicate with prior to our trip, with all questions answered promptly, and very advantageous that they are local (owned and based in Kathmandu). We had a great time, and have special thanks for Ram our guide and Binod our porter for their hard work and friendship. Ram was able to accommodate all our interests and abilities on the trek and made fabulous suggestions for restaurants and shopping. Highly recommend this tour and tour company and a visit to Nepal to all who have a passion for travel and adventure. It is an amazing place!"

However the tour was as I expected, a little loose at times things were changed without consultation with the guests but I suspect that's the nature of things in Nepal. Chitwan National Park was terrific. We saw a rhino in the wild. I did not enjoy the elephant breeding centre or the elephant bathing which seemed a total tourist trap. The elephant safari was also a lot of fun and better than the one I went on in Thailand, however got to bath the elephant there so it balances out. The trek was the highlight for me. I loved the rhododendron forests and seeing the mountains. You need to be fit but not marathon fit to do this trek. The guides were very nice but did not offer any information at all. For example we drove past Buddhas birth place and were not told. We also had a day tour in Kathmandu and that guide was excellent. So again it's a little hit and miss but I loved it."

And thank you to our drivers for keeping us safe and porters for carrying our bags on our trek.All of these people had a part in helping our trip flow seamlessly and without worry. They also provided us an insight to their country and culture that we would have missed had we travelled on our own.I won't detail everything here as it's too much, but we were able to experience so many things on this trip: sightseeing, cultural dinner shows, rafting, trekking, paragliding, zip lining, mountain flight, and more! Accommodations were clean and comfortable. We especially enjoyed the family feel of the tea houses we stayed at. Transportation was via a company-owned van, which was much more comfortable and safe for family travel than the tourist busses we saw. We opted for the drive back and forth to Pokhara instead of flying which allowed us to save some money for activities as well as enjoy the breathtaking scenery of the countryside and its villages. We had some incredible food while in Nepal and HSJ was even able to set up a cooking lesson for us at a restaurant in Thamel. We learned how to make momos and the national dish, daal bhat, a great experience for the whole family.Even though we did all of these things, it was really just scratching the surface! Nepal has so much to see and do. We're already talking about when we might be able to go back. And when we do return, we would not hesitate to book through HSJ again!"

            "review": "14 Day trek and safari. From start to finish we were looked after superbly. We were met at the airport by Binod, our guide throughout the trip. He arranged everything for us, all with a smile, nothing was too much trouble. He was a wealth of information on any subject we asked about.We met up with Binny 2, our Sherpa and our porters at Pokhara, once again they looked after our every need, always cheerful, often singing as we walked, they even tried to teach me some Nepalese. A highlight was playing cards with them at night as they taught us Nepalese card games.The canoe ride was a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu, our guide pointing out the lazy crocodiles along the river bank. We came very close to a rhino and her calf whilst sitting atop an elephant, she wasn\u2019t at all bothered by us, perhaps she could smell the elephant, and watching the elephants walking down the road after they finished work, whilst drinking a coffee at a caf\u00e9 was fabulous. We stayed at the Seven Star hotel in Chitwan which was lovely.On the trek, a day or so out of Pokhara, the haze cleared and the snow-capped mountains and red rhododendron trees appeared, they were stunning, making the walking up so worthwhile. HSJ had made a decision to break a long day in two and I was very happy with that decision as we had two fabulous days of walking instead of one very tiring one.One day along the trek while I had decided to walk alone, I went down the wrong path, but there was a porter who spotted me, guiding me back along the path \u2013 that could have been a long day! The slower members of our group always had a guide or porter with them should they need help.Accommodation was varied, from rooms with ensuites to shared facilities on the trek, but Binod always told us what to expect. Hotels in the towns and cities were good.I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Himalayan Social Journey for your next trip."

Other reviewers have told of the sites and sounds that the tour provides and I fully endorse what has been stated. Tanveer was a wonderful caring guide who \"went the extra mile\" to ensure that everyone saw and experienced everything possible but at the same time accommodating some group members inability to undertake certain activities.A few additional points not previously notedIndia have a regulation on how many Rupees you can bring INTO the country. Check with the Indian Govt. Website prior to leaving as the amount changes regularly (Anywhere between 0 and 25,000/-) Contrary to what is written obtaining cash is difficult. There are numerous ATM's, almost on every corner BUT they usually do not have any money to dispense. Changing money at hotels etc. gives a poor rate of exchange. Tanveer changed AUD. Probably the best way to travel is to be cashed up with AUD and change with the tour guide. (Avoid $100 bills as they are viewed as possible forgeries).Credit cards- Although hotels and restaurants display Visa/MasterCard signs on most occasions it is not available and the excuse is that the machine is broken. Pleading no cash is useless and you are directed to borrow from the tour guide or other travellers.Entrance fees amount to about $85AUD and then other optional activities approx. $120AUD.Remember tips.Bring lots of hand sanitiser, toilet paper, wipes etc.Water is readily available for purchase - usually about $0.60 per litre"

We recently travelled on the 13 day India's Rajasthan Revealed tour with Himalyan Social Journeys (Webjet Exclusives). What a fantastic tour with our professional, kind and organised tour guide Tanveer ensuring our tour through Rajasthan was a exciting adventure. Webjet Exclusives provided us with information on their website, via Chat and email. However, Abid, the manager of Himalyan Social Journeys gave us extensive information on the day to day itinerary, times for each location visited, the costs involved in entrance fees (to be paid daily), with suggested tips for the local tour guides, tour guide and the driver. Plus other information for our journey.Our jam packed tour enabled us to visit the various historical monuments, mosques, palaces and forts, market places etc in New Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Pushkar as listed in the itinerary on the Webjet Exclusive website. Our days were full but what wonderful sights, sounds and experiences. Our accommodation was the 3 star hotel option which were clean, tidy, comfortable (Jaipur had a roof top restaurant) and in the centre of the city near market places, restaurants nearby etc. We travelled each day in a comfortable, air conditioned 40 seater coach, with water available to buy each day. Breakfast was included in the tour package (cereal, juice, bananas or paw paw, toast, boiled or scrambled eggs, paratha, tea/coffee). Each day we stopped at clean restaurants for lunch and dinner with tasty, nourishing menus with a variety of options to eat - entrees, mains, snack food, Indian food or Chinese food. Go to the rooftop restaurant to look at the Fort in Pushkar. Be warned to have water handy to clean your teeth. Do not eat the fruit or salads, only bananas, mandarins or paw paw. Travelan tablets were helpful to us plus a few bottles of hand sanitiser, bacterial wipes and diarrhea medicine. Wear long pants, ladies suitable tops, carry a scarf plus wear closed in shoes as the streets in India are dirty with lots of rubbish in the streets. The abject poverty in some areas was a little confronting.I had trepidations about travelling to India but so glad I did. Get out of your comfort zone and experience this tour and Rajasthan. We highly recommend this tour and both Webjet Exclusives and Himalyan Social Journeys."

We had 2 guides with us all the time (both had excellent English) as well as local guides at each stop. The hotels were very good - the Clark's ones seem to be a very reliable brand, and the Crowne Plaza in Rohini, Delhi was excellent although a fair way out (but the metro was at its door step). The latter has just won the best restaurant in India! The tour was very thorough covering all the big ticket places we expected to see in the limited time (12 days) and we had plenty of time at each place. Thought had been given to visits eg being at the Taj Mahal early morning for good photo ops and reduced tourist numbers, as well as evening and early morning (boat) visits to the Ganges Ghats at Varanasi. Our guides, Akshay and Ibraheim worked non stop trying to fit in special requests from the group as well as caring for us to the nth degree on the trains, especially on the sleeper. The buses were clean and well air conditioned, and drivers very good. The airport transfers worked seamlessly. If this tour was an example of what Himalayan Social Journey provide, then I can recommend them unconditionally. Well done, guys!"

We love the country, the people and there culture. Nepal is an amazing beautiful country and Basho just makes you want to come back and visit again. Our driver was especially courteous and very safety oriented while driving with us in the car. We are so appreciative of Himalayan Social Journey for giving us the opportunity to see all the beauty their country has to offer through the eyes of a great tour guide and friend. We will post pictures at a later time as we took 5000 pictures in total.Thank You Basho & DilipLazaro & Maria"

Thank you to Tanveer and Abid, Luvli and Suni as well as all the hotel staff who were all wonderful. Also Raju from Abyss Tours (Tiger Safari) added to the interest by telling us about the crops on the way to Ranthambore and managing to overcome all obstacles (flat tyre) in a calm capable manner. I would recommend these tours to all and in particular suggest the three star option because you get to stay in hotels reminiscent of the \"Marigold Hotel\", situated in the middle of the towns where all the local action is taking place. Having a regular supply of bottled water on the bus and bananas for snacks was a nice touch. Take an adapter for charging and we took a multiboard with surge control to increase our opportunity to charge all our cameras and tablets etc. a once. We were lucky there was only 20 people on the big bus which made it easier to get comfortable and get on with each other. We didn't see a tiger but that is the way of the jungle lol. We saw lots of deer, antelope, etc. and had some exciting rides on the roads of the national park."

Amazing sights, non stop adventure and colour. Mr Tanveer was able to be flexible with the itinerary and added some great extras in such as a cooking class in Pushkar, which was expensive but, well worth it. This was only possible because we had a small group of fantastic people. Be aware that if you take an upgrade you will be some way out of town and may miss out on great little restaurants and some fun times. Don't let the hotels sell you the buffet unless you are REALLY hungry and be aware there is a service charge and VAT on bills and 30% tax on alcohol. India is an assault on the senses and if you are a first timer to India, this is a great way to travel. Wonderful architecture which rivals just about everything I have seen in Europe. Don't forget your camera and plug for recharging."

I could not express my journey through Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Varanasi better than Alan M's \"A journey through time\", appearing below. Please read his review. Be shocked, feel pity, be inspired and impressed and most of all be grateful.The Indian people working with tourists seem anxious for perfection! Often called upon to comment on \"how can I improve my services\". We did experience perfection at the Crown Plaza hotel we were privileged to stay in for a few nights at the beginning of our journey and also at the end. Other hotels we stayed in along the way were also very good to almost great.The hawkers hassled us into submission often, the guides were knowledgeable and helpful and the skilled driver of the bus was admired by each of our 14 party of Australians.I believe we all appreciated the energetic and enthusiastic help from our young \"caretaker\" who accompanied us throughout the journey and kept us all safe.Breathtaking architecture to hovels for homes, beautiful saris, starched white linen suits worn with waistcoats, colourful turbans and then jeans and gaudy colours combined to look wonderful.Rickshaw journeys - the incessant honking, the excitement of the close shaves, the fascinating sights changing every split second, (a cow resting inside a jewellery shop), cows everywhere, monkeys, camels, horses, donkeys, pigs, goats etc. etc. Who could sum up this experience?I must admit that I think India is confronting and perhaps not a suitable holiday destination for sensitive young people - sometimes too heartbreaking and certainly not clean, neat and tidy."

With a big reduction in tourist numbers since the 2015 earthquake, we found we were the only 3 people on the tour.Prior to the tour we visited the HSJ offices, and Ram tailored the tour to better meet our needs.Bishnu Bhattarai was our guide, and Pradip Khadka was our porter.Bishnu has excellent knowledge of the tour, and was exceptional when it came to managing the trekking component. He knows loads of people along the trail, and was brilliant at helping us when the language barrier became too much.One person in our tour became sick and had to go to hospital in Pokhara. Bishnu problem-solved the whole thing and minimised the impact on the trek. Brilliant - a 5 star guide! The actual Trek was amazing, but is perhaps more difficult than the information would suggest. Best advice, train, train and train for the downhill steps (especially Ban Thanti to Tadapani). Our 15 year old son took it in his ample stride and loved the whole experience.The visit to Chitwan National Park was excellent, especially as we spied 5 Rhinos (two of which were babies!). Our guide in Chitwan was Narayan, who could see all manner of birds, and knew every one of them.The luxury wind down at Gokarna Forest Resort (our choice) was great. Staff are willing to help with everything, and the golf course is exceptional (as are the caddies).What would I do differently? - pay the US$100 to fly from Pokhara back to Kathmandu. With the fuel crisis in Nepal, the road trip is very slow and you waste a whole day on the bus.Otherwise, train for the walking, especially the downhill, and enjoy.It's a wonderful tour with awe inspiring views of the amazing Himalayas."

From Dilip our driver in Kathmandu, to our Sherpas , Bodri and Naba on our trek to Basu our guide in Kathmandu everyone made our Nepal experience even that more special.We have fond memories of our trip and wish to thank all who contributed to making it so special. When we retun to Nepal we will most definitely be using The Himalayan Social Journey."

However, I am looking forward to the massage, yoga and mediation in a 5 star resort to end our adventure. Our guide, Bishnu Bhattarai is fantastic, he goes above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of our trip goes perfectly! His local knowledge ensures that we get the best of everything available at every turn. For example, I needed to see a doctor and he arranged it whilst ensuring that the rest of my family could continue trekking. He then took me via an alternate route to meet up with my family and still experience the amazing Himalayas. Bishnu is lots of fun too, teaching us local card games in the evenings and sharing jokes with us and our lovey porter Pradip. The variety of places and experiences on this trip ensure that you get to experience the many faces of Nepal. Can't recommend HSJ and this trip more highly! The only suggestion I would make is to ensure that you are very fit to take on the trekking - it is not easy!"

The 1st day\u2019s excursion around Katmandu was lovely, the guide was so helpful and friendly. Later in a few days time we left for a 12 day trek up to the Everest Base Camp together with a great bunch of people :) The views whilst going up were absolutely incredible, there was literally no time to think of how tired you\u2019re or how much you want to have a shower or eat.. We walked around 15-20 km a day and then had ability to rest in these cosy hotels with home made food, friendly staff:) The feeling of being so high up and having being able to rest in houses was just amazing. Our guide was so professional, always helped if anything came up, everyone felt safe and happy and genuinely all of us had The Time of Our Lives together. I will be coming back.Im saying a big thank you to Himalayan Social journey team and guides Bishnu Basnet and Nanga Dorji:)"

As usual she did all the research and picked Himalayan Social Journey from the bunch and they didn't disappoint. Special thanks to our guide Mingmar Sherpa and porter Umesh who made a huge difference to the enjoyment of our trek.To start with, our flights into Kathmandu were delayed which meant we had to change our start date for the trek. This meant we couldn't join our designated group but instead trek separately with a different guide. HSJ were very flexible and were able to organise everything with little notice.Mingmar is an excellent guide. He was always attentive and clearly is knowledgeable about the land and the requirements of the trek. If any problems arise or you want to modify the itinerary he can suggest the best options to help you get the most out of your trek.I'm certain I wouldn't have reached the top of Kala Patthar if it wasn't for Mingmar. I was happy to sit this one out given the difficulty but Mingmar somehow got me to the top. He (and Umesh) carried our daypacks (and my heavy DSLR) when things got really tough.I'm glad we went with HSJ and especially grateful we had Mingmar and Umesh who made sure we achieved our goals and had a great time as well. Highly recommend them both!"

The sightseeing tour was awesome, we learnt a lot from our guide in terms of buddhism, history etc. The only thing I would wish for is to stay a bit longer at each attraction, but overall we felt the guide added a lot more depth to our knowledge and makes it so much more interesting. On the other hand, our trek was fantastic, our guide Mingmar sherpar and our porter umesh took us to off - the beaten trek places and gave us a glimpse into the sherpa local people ways of life. We felt we were very well looked after throughout the trek and through their encouragement, we somehow managed to make it to Base camp+Kala Pattar and back. I don't think we would have been able to done all of that without our guide and porter. The company itself values the customer's feedback and are quick to respond via email. when our flights got delayed for 1 day, the company were flexible enough to accommodate and we appreciate all the hard work they did to make sure we had an enjoyable trip. One bonus is their packages are also very good value for money and employ local staff like Mingmar so we know our money is going back to the local economy. I would highly recommend this company."

There were many highlights and great experiences during the trip but there were also times when we were frustrated at the lack of communication from the HSJ representive who accompanied us for the majority of the trip. In particular we were often left unsure of exactly what we were about to see along the way, how long the journey would take to our next destination and when we woukd be stopping for lunch etc. We enjoyed a great selection of places of interest that included forts and palaces in New Delhi, Agra and the amazing cities of Jaipur and Varanasi, all of which on reflection were worth the many hours spent on the tour bus driving along bumpy and dusty roads. The overnight train journey from Agra to Varanasi was a challenge and I was grateful of the offer made by HSJ to do the return trip by plane. With the exception of our stay in Delhi, accommodation was not 5 star as advertised and mainly consisted of what I regarded as 3 or 3.5. Too much time was allocated to 'visiting' factories and workshops with the inevitable shopping outlet and an unspoken expectation or 'opportunity' to buy something. Time spent at these came at the expense of free time to wander around at our own leisure or to take a short rest! Having listed a number of negative comments I must add that our guides were, in the main, friendly, knowledgeable and great company and certainly added to the enjoyment of the trip. I had wanted to visit Northern India for a very long time and it did not disappoint me. HSJ provided a hassle free experience and one which I will never forget."

We felt too much time was spent in New Delhi which was incredibly smoggy and had awful traffic. Only one of the hotels met the 4 to 5 start rating as promised in the trip advertising. Generally the guides were very good although we were annoyed that so much time was spent visiting local artisan workshops with a subsequent hard sell afterwards. Many of the days were very long (up to 10 hours on a very basic bus). The trip could be imroved by providing adequate information about the plans for each day. The train trip was not worth the effort."

As I was going on my own, initially I planned to find a female guide for my trek, however, I was getting lazy and didn't want to take care of transport etc on my own, so in the end, I chose to join a package from this tour company because of the speed they have replied my emails and the attractive price quoted for low season (Jan).This was my first trek in Nepal, and my guide (whom also acted as my porter)- Santosh paid attention to many small details throughout the whole trip, from the numerous breaks during trekking to even cutlery I used for my meals. And it is a good experience to learn something about Nepalese people while talking to him in the few days I was travelling with him.And special mention to Dilip my driver for Kathmandu and Nagarkot part of the trip, he is a very nice guy and cares a lot about my safety and comfort during driving, he warned me every time when the road was getting bumpy, and he kept me entertained during our trip to Nagarkot. And my guide on the first day to Kathmandu is also amazing, (I am sorry, I forgot his name), he is knowledgable with very good English, and he could tell me a bit more about political situation in Nepal which is very interesting to me. He is very helpful in all ways too, helping me to buy a SIM card and all.Despite the earthquake and the fuel crisis, the sights in Nepal are still worth seeing, and there is not much effect on tourists. Yes, some of the world heritage sites are partially damaged during the earthquake, and yes, sometimes there are power outages. However, it is still worth going, and your support to this country by going there is going to directly help the Nepalese people, as tourism is like the most important industry there."

The entire journey and logistics was almost flawless. accommodation and food at the hotels was of a good standard and value for money, other than the Clarks in Varanasi where the food was sub par. The days were quite long and exhausting, having traveled and taken in so much information at each site. We felt that after visiting so many amazing temples and forts, that by the time we reached Varanasi by overnight train we were rather tired and needed some rest. The temples etc in Varanasi were insignificant compared to what we had experienced in Dehli, Jaipur and Agra, and thought some down time would have been a better option. Walking the alleyways and Ghats within the Gangies and experiencing the ceremony that takes place each night was an unforgettable experience. The street food was also amazing, and being advised by the guides what was ok to eat and what was not. We were happy with the service and knowledge of most of the guides, particularly S.K in Jaipur, also Dada and Peakash in Varanasi who were both great guys who spoke very good English and showed us the real Varanasi (thank you) the bus driver and his assistant were very curtious And had thankfully ferried us around safely. Archie ?? The young man who accompanied us for most of the journey was quite attentive when called upon. However he did not follow up accommodation and transfer arrangements as promised for our onward journey. We were very grateful for Adib for pre booking and paying for ongoing flights to save us the hassle. All in all we were shown an amazing hassle free experience of northern India. We will most definitely do another tour with HSJ, but next time with either less people or just the two of us. Thanks again,Matt & Cherry Foster."

Nothing was too much trouble and Ganga was attentive to our needs while giving us space to enjoy our own company. His knowledge of the countryside and wildlife was extensive and he was really a guide to the beautiful country of Nepal rather than just a tour guide. We were in a group of only 4 with only one other couple who we hit it off with immediately which of course made a massive difference. The trekking part is well managed with plenty of time for exploring the local villages, eating, drinking and enjoying the ambience of being within view of a 7000m mountain range. A really average level of fitness is required. If a soft bed is a necessity this is probably not the trip for you but the food everywhere was amazing, cold beer always available and the Nepalese are lovely people and very welcoming. Unfortunately we were not very lucky with the weather with a fair amount of cloud obscuring the mountain views, but when they peek out it is something to behold. Despite the fuel issues everything went smoothly and you can't help but feel for the Nepalese people who are doing it tough - especially heading into Winter."

There was no pressure to live up to an ideal way of trekking which was a great relief, I did it on my own terms and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The scenery was spectacular and the tea-houses clean and welcoming. They were quite simple but that was clearly explained in the beginning. We had wonderful support also from our young porter, Ganesh, who was energetic and positive the whole time. Nepal is obviously struggling from the after-affects of the earthquake and the territorial dispute with India resulting in fuel shortages, however, as tourists we were not affected unlike the Nepalese population. It's always difficult being in a position of privilege in a third world country, but that's why it's so important to go there and spend our tourist dollars, it's the best way to support their economy and keep people in work. My traveling companion fainted one day and the support was both instantaneous and caring and she received medical attention almost straight away. I felt totally safe in Nepal and if you want an experience that will put you in the present moment most of the time then I would encourage you to do a trek, I hardly thought about my life at home at all and after fourteen days I felt as though I had been away for five weeks."

The trip was well planned and organised by Ram and his team with some really nice personal touches like being greeted by our guide upon our early arrival in country and farewell at the airport. While we enjoyed many experiences including whitewater rafting and elephant ride, the highlight of the trip was definitely the trek itself. It was a bit difficult in parts, but as someone who had done very little physical preparation, I found that it was manageable and I was surprised at how little my legs ached! This was largely due to our tour guide managing an easy but steady pace to cater for our group of ten. The accommodation during the trek is fairly basic, but it was clean and warm despite temperatures dropping below zero a few nights. The food was better than expected, with pizza and pasta on the menu in most of the guesthouses where we stayed...I was really only expecting rice and curry. We were blessed with great visibility and the scenery was nothing short of spectacular. Our tour guide, Binod (Binny) was simply awesome - nothing was too much trouble for him. Our porters (Pim, Amrith, Krishna and Roupesz) were also fantastic, carrying our packs the whole way...and providing some great entertainment as well! I felt totally safe the whole time I was in Nepal. It is clear that the country is still struggling to get back on its feet from the earthquake and is dealing with the current fuel crisis, however the Nepalese people continue to take these issues in their stride with a smile on their face - they are such kind-hearted, beautiful people. I encourage anyone considering going to Nepal to just do it - the best way to support this country is through tourism.

We decided on an itinerary prior to our arrival. It would be a 6 day/5 night tour in Kathmandu and Pokhara. Ram would also arrange to purchase our roundtrip airfare on Yeti Airlines to Pokhara. I arranged our hotels in Kathmandu and Pokhara.I understand that Nepal is going through hard times and some of the negativity is outside the company's control but some of it is entirely within their control. Being upfront and honest is the way to go.Arrival \u2013 in Kathmandu Airport, there is a person who is holding a Himalayan Social Journey sign. However, he does not work for the company. He only showed us the car not 5 steps away and asked for a tip.We were taken to the office to make payment for our tour \u2013 USD 125 per person for the tour and $240 per person for the roundtrip airfare on Yeti. Prior to leaving, I asked if credit card would be accepted. The answer was yes. What Ram failed to tell me was the 4% surcharge. That would be a helpful piece of information to have. On the day we flew to Pokhara, we were driven to the airport and dropped off. We walked into an empty building and was unsure where the airline check in was. We had to ask someone for help. It would have been helpful to have some guidance there. We are pretty self sufficient but that was still odd to us.In Pokhara, an additional person was added to our Private tour without comment or explanation. The 5 of us were in a tiny car. The \u201cguide\u201d we had in Pokhara was not a sightseeing guide. He was a trekker. He gave no explanations \u2013 just walked with us from place to place.Again, additional people were to be added to our Private tour in Kathmandu and it was only when I asked Ram about it, we were given the private tour. We paid for and arranged for a private tour. Everyone knows a group tour costs less. We understand there is a fuel shortage. Ask us. Do not just assume. Have things in writing \u2013 in email exchanges with Ram, the boat ride in Phewa Lake was included but the Pokhara guide stood there and argued with me. I asked him to call Ram and he did finally call to confirm it was included. He kept saying it was not expensive. That is not the point.In Kathmandu, they asked what time we wanted to start each day \u2013 really? They are the tour company. This is their business. I have never been to Nepal before. How do I know what the driving time is, how long one should spend, etc.Prior to arrival, we decided on sightseeing for 5 days but when we got there, everything was suddenly fluid and we only ended up with tours for 3 days with us having 2 days of nothing to do. We should have shortened our trip if this was the case.On the morning of departure, our hotel tried to call the office but no one answered and Ram\u2019s cell was out of service. Hindsight \u2013 I should have booked the Yeti Airlines ticket myself prior to the fuel crisis \u2013 would have saved some money prior to the price hike. Also, you can arrange for day tours with the help of the hotel once you are in Nepal.We have been to many countries (78 and counting) and joined many tours and this was probably one of the oddest tours we have taken. Bottom line is that communication is the key to a good tour."

Due to unforeseen circumstances we had to change our itinerary radically several times and the guys at HSJ could not have been more helpful or accommodating in tailoring a trek to what we had in mind. Yes, you're steered towards certain lodges but they're usually good options and you've always the choice of somewhere else, particularly off-season like we were. Special mention to our porter/guide Binod. He couldn't have done more for us and his good humour and energy made the trek. Thanks again"

            "review": "India tour - best ever!. The tour of Rajastan, Delhi and Varanassi is the best tour I have ever done anywhere. It was a small group tour that took me to all the places I wanted to visit for a very reasonable price. Apart from breakfast, the cost did not include meals which, I think, is a good thing. I hate having to stop and eat just because it's on the program. I would rather eat simply and spend more time exploring. Also, I find that organised tours quite often take you to \"tourist restaurants\" where the fare is poor. The tour guides, generally, found restaurants to suit us and all but one was excellent and inexpensive. The accommodation was not luxurious but it was comfortable, clean and better than just adequate. The tour guides spoke excellent and clear English, were knowledgeable and flexible. We had some choice in what we wanted to do but the included experiences were great fun: a ride on an elephant, a row boat on the Ganges and an overnight train trip. There were also staff in the background organising and keeping us safe in a caring and unobtrusive way and attending to all those little requests. And, even before we arrived in India, emails were always answered and the agency was able to recommend and arrange for us to do other things if we were extending our stay. Everyone wants to do the Golden Triangle and see the Taj Mahal but Varanassi was, by far, the highlight for me. One can see why the Ganges River is holy and I am so glad it was included in this tour."

At 58 years old and being non Trekkers my friend saw an ad for a 16 day trek to base camp with Himalayan social journey( His Mum had done it 15 years before at 65 Couldn't be that hard!!), it seamed too cheap by far considering it included every small item inc a two day stay at the Hyatt regency to recover. I was sceptical as to how it would work on that budget. Firstly i was of the opinion that when the earthquakes occurrred after we booked that cutting off the Nepalise the oportunity to get get work was not going to help them recover so we would go as long as the tour company said yes. The two of us arrived nov 18th 2015 and it went like clockwork just as the Itinery said. Ram The owner was great and very accommodating. Our Guide Ganga Thapa was brilliant,a university graduate with over 45 base camp trips under his belt not to mention Mountaineering experience and the Anapurna circuit and others, his caring nature and willingness to point out flora and fauna made even me take notice . His sense of humour made the hills smaller. Their choice of accommodation was good value with quality higher than i was expecting. The porters that helped gave willingly of their time to make sure we were always fed and watered at mealtimes Bier and Roson are fondly remembered by us. All in all the trip was great, value for money was great and god knows how we got two nights of pure luxury at the Hyatt included in the deal beats me. Support Nepal, Trust HSJ go to EBC if we can do it so can you !"

Besides trekking we kayaked in Chitwan, walked in the National Park, rode Elephants and saw plenty of wildlife, including two pairs of mother and child rhinos, went white water rafting, stayed in fantastic hotels, saw Cultural shows, had massages, ate beautiful food, but mostly had a completely unique experience so different from any we have had before. We also felt that we were supporting a noble race of people that have suffered ongoing hardship. Many Nepalis thanked us for coming to their country. They said that we were 'saving their country'.

Every part of my dealings with this company were first class and I would recommend them to everyone who wishes to trek in Nepal and anywhere else that HSC organise treks without hesitation.I booked this trek 18 months ago and the process was very straight forward. In the time between booking and commencing the trek, HSC kept in contact with me on a regular basis and this was highlighted when they were in regular contact during the terrible earthquakes and the aftermath keeping me fully updated about conditions.I arrived in Kathmandu on 2nd November, 2015 and through the chaos of Tribhuvan Int Airport, I was quickly able to identify the transport that HSC had sent for me and was soon on my way to their main offices. At their offices I met with Ram and Binod and I felt instantly at ease with the company and the arrangements for the trek.I was then conveyed to the hotel selected by HSC which was the excellently located Holy Himalaya in the Thamel District.Prior to the commencement of the trek HSC laid on a tour of the city and a welcome meal for the participants of the trek.Our trek commenced on Friday 6th November, 2015 with an early morning flight to Lukla which was thrilling in every way. We also met up with Binod again together with another guide Bishnu and a young assistant by the name of Kubir.The trek was fantastic in every way and was enhanced by the helpfulness of Binod, Bishnu and Kubir who could not do enough for us.The accommodation in the form of the The Tea Houses were basic but comfortable. There was good food served at all the tea houses. Most had showered although not all had hot water. All had at least one western style toilet and incredibly all had WiFi even the highest located tea house at Gorek Shep (5000m). You could even get a beer!The trek was marvellous. I had been informed by HSC that October and November were the best times to do this trek weatherise. We did not have one drop of rain and the day time temperatures reached 21/22c. It was cold at night but the tea house were generally well heated. The days treks are well planned as are the acclimatisation days at Namche Bazar and Dingboche.It was incredible to reach Everest Base Camp and also a fairly emotional experience.The highest point that I got to on the trek was Kalapatthar at 5544m. I recommend that if you do this trek and are able, that you make the effort to get to the top of this peak. It offers fantastic views of Everest - the best that you will see on the trek.At the conclusion of the trek we were flown back to Kathmandu and then conveyed to our hotel. We were also transported to the Airport by HSC at the end of the visit to Kathmandu.In conclusion, HSC made this such a special trip/trek. Their staff are friendly and hard working - nothing was too much for them. The trek was brilliantly organised. I only met Ram briefly. But I got to know Binod, Bishnu and Kubir fairly well on the trek and class them as friends.All the best for the future HSC and I will have no hesitation in booking another trek with you, hopefully in 2017."

First of all would like to point out to all those who are worried that Nepal is unsafe after last years earthquake may we recommend you put your worries aside. Yes there is some damage but Nepal and the Nepalese are absolutely wonderful; and not once did we feel unsafe. HSJ helped us plan and organize our trip. Their emails and communications were quick and helpful in the planning stages. They were ready to accommodate us and plan the trip to what we wanted not to some set standard. We ended up doing the Annapurna Circuit trek in Nepal for 11 nights. Our guide was Bishnu Bhattarai - the best treking guides we have ever had and we have done a lot of trekking. Bishnu was caring and fun. We recommend you get him to join you in a game or 2 of cards. The Annapurna Circuit was a beautiful trek. Some of the guest houses were OK and some were not so OK. Bishnu tried to find us the best ones in every place we stayed but you have to realize that sometimes it is what it is or that's what is available so live with it. In Tibet we were going to go treking as well, which HMJ had arranged, but at the last minute, when we were on the Annapurna Trek we decided it was going to be too cold - so without complaining about the last minute changes HMJ kindly helped us re-arrange our Tibet Trip to a driving / site seeing trip rather than a hiking to Everest Trip. Thank goodness because it was cold in Tibet. I cannot tell you how many times we asked HMJ to make changes (some small and some large) to our schedule while we were on the road. We have never had a more accommodating Tour Company than them. They never complained about our changes, always helped us and made good suggestions. Everyone from the drivers to the guides and the office personnel were helpful and friendly. Three last suggestions - if you are doing a city tour of Kathmandu through HMJ ask for Swami Basu dev as your tour guide, Very knowledgeable and interesting guide. Secondly, we would go back to Nepal and use HMJ in an instant. We do not ever need to go back to Tibet. The tour company was good but it was the actual country we did not like as much as Nepal. Lastly, Nepal has a lot to offer. We only saw a part of it. Take your time and enjoy the people and culture. You will not regret it."

We began as three but left feeling we had made some fantastic new friends having shared a wonderful adventure.From the moment we were met at the airport through to our departure three weeks later, I was always impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of everyone at HSJ. They love Nepal and are keen to share their fantastic country - not in a pushy way but with enthusiasm and genuine pride for their people, culture and those impressive mountains.Accommodation was great, transport was comfortable and reliable (particularly given the fuel crisis). From the hotel staff through to management, everyone was always friendly, efficient and professional. During our six-day Annapurna trek, our guide, Ram Chandra, and his porter team were key in shaping our trip. Their experience, humour and care spoke volumes.If you're thinking of going to Nepal,this is an excellent company. If you are tempted to cancel an existing trip, please don't. The Nepalese have been slugged with far too much this year. Tourism is their lifeline and those who visit will not be disappointed."

We had a ball visiting some of India's iconic buildings and locations such as, the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Lotus Temple, the holy lake at Pushkar and many more. All the places and locations visited gave you feelings between stunning to fascinating. We were in Jaipur at the peak of the Indian celebration for 'Diwali'. During this celebration there are fireworks going off everywhere. We had dinner on the rooftop of or hotel (Ramada) and saw the city 'going off'. November is definitely a good time to be in India as it is the month of celebrations and weddings according to our bus driver 'Raju'. Speaking of our driver, he was excellent, spoke reasonable English and explained about what to expect at each location. Raju looked after us, on and off the bus. He told us when to be careful of pick-pockets, where not to go after dark, how to deal with the numerous beggars. He had good advice on eating from the street stalls and how to eat a large deep fried green chilli stuffed with potato masala - Yum ! Late one night, Raju walked us to our hotel, as he believed it was safer for us. All in all, this is a great experience if you enjoy eating different food, seeing a different culture (in the main a very friendly culture) and getting a little out of your comfort zone. Our tour only had 9 people and what a great group. Although we mainly stuck together when attending a site/location with a guide, people were happy to go off & do other things - no pressure. Thanks to this tour we have made some new and interesting friends and will try to catch-up with them for a re-union of sorts. Based on our experience on this trip, I would recommend this Rajasthan Revealed Tour by the Himalayan Social Journey group to any of my friends who wanted to get out and see a bit of India. We meet with Mr Abid ZARGAR the Director at the start and at the finish of the tour in Delhi. Mr ZARGAR took great intrest in how you found the tour and was looking for any advice in improving it which was great. His personal meeting with your before and after is such a change from sending off a Feedback Sheet to some unknown sometime later. Excellent stuff - Loved It !!!"

We started with the city tour of Kathmandu with our very informative and captivating guide, Basu. We did the Poon Hill trek a year ago, including the city tour and were able to see for ourselves the affects of the earthquake. The vast majority of buildings were unscathed although some of the temples have been affected but are in the process of repair. Our guide for the trek was Bishnu Bhattarai, along with our two porters, Deepak and Mingma. The trek was tough going, walking between 4-8 hours each day but with the constant support and encouragement from these lovely 3 people, we got to EBC! Bishnu is very knowledgeable about all aspects of the Nepal and Himalayas, constantly offering information along the way, giving us many photo opportunities of the wonderful scenery, teaching us Nepalese words and numbers and keeping us entertained! Deepak and Mingma were both so caring and looked after us constantly. They truly were brilliant! The food along the way was tasty with a varied choice and the guesthouses were welcoming, most with fires in the evenings. Even though we completed the trek, we were unprepared for the freezing night time temperatures and lack of washing/shower facilities. In hindsight, we should have taken a -20 degrees sleeping bag and fewer changes of clothes! We would highly recommend HSJ."

I can't say enough good things about this company and its employees. We worked with them to coordinate a 45 day trip which consisted of trekking in Nepal and Tibet, complex travel logistics, several day tours and and ultimately - numerous on the fly changes to our itinerary during our trip. Simply put, they were awesome. Lets start with our trekking guide - Bishnu. For 11 days - he was our protector, our facilitator, our accommodater and our cheer leader. He assured our every need was looked after and never took anything for granted, constantly making sure we were comfortable and safe. He knew when to push us and when to lay off. He was so conscientious and encouraging. Of all the guided treks I have done, he ranks as the top guide. The porters were also awesome - always ready to lend a hand, make things a little easier or more comfortable. At night, we all enjoyed the company of each other playing cards and sharing funny moments. Bishnu and his crew were not only highly professional and competent, but truly beautiful caring people. I am proud to call them my friends.  The company espouses the same persona. Competent and caring, when we had travel hiccups due to weather related issues, they were there to adjust and readjust and arrange alternate transportation on a moments notice. When we decided to completely reorganize the Tibet portion of our trip with 2 days notice- they happily accommodated without penalizing us. The day tour of Kathmandu was absolutely amazing thanks to their tour guide - Swami Basu. I was astounded at his knowledge and insight and energized with the in depth discussions we had about the most significant part of this region's culture - religion and its relationship to every day life. I didn't want the day or the discussions to end. Bottom line is if you are looking for a tour company for this region (Nepal, India, Tibet, Bhutan), look no further. Whether its trekking or cultural you won't be disappointed. They are knoweldable, fair and caring and strive to please in every way possible."

We received high value and high quality travel services from start to finish. There is plenty of guidance material on the web for the preparation for this trek. My mistakes are worthy of note. Carry only 2 to 4 kgs with you and put about 10 kgs on the Yak or Sherpa to carry. I carried all sorts of communication, SAR and camera equipment including chargers and spare batteries etc. You need one camera that is specified to work in the cold \u2013 one of mine didn\u2019t. There are charging facilities, Wi-Fi and mobile coverage at many places on the trek. You need trekking poles. You need layers for the trip and you should not take a spare change of clothes for every day. Plan to buy just about everything at Kathmandu as the prices are unbelievably cheap and so cheap you can leave this with the people at Kathmandu after the trek. The Lukla airport arrival and departure is not as hazardous as advertised. Take Diamox two days prior to departure and carry anti-biotics, aspirin or Panadol and nausea medication. Go straight to Kathmandu and don\u2019t combine with another (business) trip as I did. I travelled from Australia to USA on a 35 hour flight then had four days of Jet-lag of two hours sleep a night and then 30 hours to Kathmandu. I took cold showers in sub-zero temperatures and all of this caused me to end up with Pneumonia and some altitude sickness at Namche. Himalayan Social Journey organised the helicopter evacuation and hospitalization for me. They even visited me in hospital in Kathmandu and provided surface transport right up until departure. They stay with you and provide whatever you need. Their porters are fantastic and help with cultural and practical requirements. I am planning to return to finish the trek in MAY/JUN16 and that will be with Himalayan Social Journey \u2013 Highly recommended."

Then third day we were taken to Sundarijal from where we hiked to Chisapani, 12km uphill by stairs. It was rough but worth it because up there we could see the Himalayan mountains <3 We had our own mountain guide and porter with us. Our guide, Narendra, was amazing and so caring. The fourth day we hiked from Chisapani to Nagarkot, 24km nepali flat (meaning up and down but not as heavy uphill like it was the day before). Everything went well and nepali people everywhere were so nice and helpful. The fifth day we got back to the city and had special dinner with our mountain guide in Kathmandu. All these services was included in our package with hotels and breakfasts (in Chisapani it was a cottage/hostel, but very nice one in those conditions). And last but not least, we had an excellent driver in use during the whole time (also included in price). He picked us from the airport, take us around the city, drove us back and forth to the mountains and take us back to the airport too. In the traffic of Kathmandu, a good driver is a blessing and we had one!! Very good first trip to Nepal, can be recommended warmly :)"

From the moment I exited Tribhuvan airport the team from Himalayan Social Journey made sure everything went without a hitch. Despite the inconvenience caused by the current political issues and fuel crisis, HSJ was able to stick with our itinerary. Our wonderful guide, Ganga, and the 'supporters' that assisted our group on the trek (Binod, Ari, Subas, Ganesh and Bhupesh) were so attentive and helpful.Most of the areas we visited had either not been affected or had recovered from the devastating earthquakes earlier in the year, so I would encourage future visitors to Nepal to not be deterred by those events. I will be recommending this trip to all my family and friends.However, I must state that the words 'easy' and 'entry-level' don't accurately describe the six day trek in the Annapurna region - it was much harder than most of our group anticipated, so they weren't physically prepared for it. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the trip and the team from Himalayan Social Journey. "

My wife and I have just returned from a couple of weeks in Nepal which included a 10 day Explore Nepal trip run by Himalayan Social Journey. It was a great trip and Himalayan Social Journey did a great job. They picked us up from the airport and made us feel relaxed and welcome in Nepal. They tool care of all the things that can sometimes be a pain in the butt in a foreign country with a language you don't speak. They organised accommodation, bus tickets, various activities which left us to concentrate on having a good time. We got stuck into some rafting, trekking, paragliding and loved it all. We had been told that there have been a number of people who have been cancelling trips to Nepal due to safety concerns and potential problems encountered after the earthquake earlier in the year. We had no such problems and were well looked after by our guide Raju Guru and porter Amrid. My wife and I had not travelled in a number of years due to a couple of small people that have taken over our lives and it was wonderful to walk the earth again. Nepal was a great place to visit with the smells, the food, the chaos and of course the mountains. I would highly recommend it and Himalayan Social Journey to prospective travellers.Michael Hahn"

Our Porters (Pridap, Krishna, and Homnath) did an awesome job for our group of 6 and they too were cheerful and helpful throughout. At all times when we were in Kathmandu and in the mountains we felt very safe and the Nepalese people were friendly and welcoming.

After receiving a voucher from a friend three weeks prior to the tour start we soon started thinking about the decision we've made given Nepal's recent natural disasters as well as the fuel crisis. Our concerns were soon dispelled. The fuel crisis didn't affect our tour besides a 1.5hr delay on one day departing and a few restaurants not serving their full menu in Kathmandu. Nothing to spoil our holiday, there were lots of other options. Evidence of the earth quake was hard to determine given the country is a third world country anyway and even after being there in 2014 I struggled to see the difference. All in all with less traffic on the road and less tourists, NOW IS THE TIME TO GO TO NEPAL"

            "review": "Wonders are not only for the young. We certainly had wonderful experiences and we certainly are not young. From a 69 and 75 year old perspective trekking in the Himalayan mountains does not have to be stressful for the person who with moderate fitness. We did no preparation but we do lead an active lifestyle and we chose the least extreme walk with the Himalayan Social Journey company. It was a 3/4 day walk going to 2200 mt - so not so high; but the views were still extraordinary. We saw 7 of the 8 highest mountains in the world. We took a mountain flight at dawn (which was truly amazing) flying from Kathmandu east to Everest - being very close on the turnaround at Mt Everest to the majesty of Everest and the other Mountains. But on our walk we saw the sunrise 3 times as it highlighted the snow topped mountains of the Annapurna range - each time we saw different perspectives of the mountains or mountains that were hidden behind other mountains so although we were not so high as to be concerned with altitude sickness we did appreciate the mountains in all their wild majestic beauty.Kathmandu has recovered from the earthquake surprisingly well. It has made a real effort to clear away debris and in the case of important monuments has done this carefully in order to be able to reconstruct them. Of course there are still people living in tents but it does all seem very ordered and orderly.We were not in the most effected areas. Apart from Kathmandu we were in areas that were lucky and but most people knew of someone who was effected by landslides or falling buildings. The main problem for the people at the moment is a lack of fuel for transport and cooking. The road to India is blocked and this is making life difficult with rationing and long cues for the fuel that they are able to get but the people are cheerful and strong in the face of adversity and they find ways to live with grace and humour and generosity. The hotels and the people are using wood fires to cook on and so the celebrations for Dashain, the major Hindu festival was still enjoyed. As we trekked through the villages the families were generous enough to include us in their festival with offers of tea and special treats that they had prepared. And we got to know just how far some of the younger folk had travelled to return for this important time. One young man came from UAR, he worked as a cook in resort out of Dubai and he was flying back in a couple of days - others were from closer in Nepal or in Malaysia.Nepal is not only mountains and monuments but also many rivers that are harnessed for hydroelectricity as well as white water rafting. We rafted on the Trishuli River on our way to Chitwan. It was fun but not dangerous as the company makes sure that experienced people are in charge. Chitwan is a special place; very different from the higher altitudes. It is the lowest altitude in Nepal and quite humid and the jungle has very different trees and animals. We did not see a tiger but did ride on an elephant and got very close to a rhino without bothering him, lots of deer and orchids too.On the last day of our trek a couple of us chose to paraglide down to the lake at Pokara. It was great fun.The guides were all very experienced and professional. Our first guide Ramchandra Dhounya was actually taking a group up to Poon Hill and we just tagged along for a few days doing the rafting and Chitwan area, he was very charming and personable as was his son. Our second guide, Bishna Prasad Bhattarai looked after us for longer and did a superb job finding accommodation in the simple mountain lodges that met our requirements in the difficult reality of very little fuel, certainly not luxurious but all with ensuite, and hot water, and good food as well as interesting people and scenery.Our porters, Krishna Pandey and Prakash Simkhoda, were also personable and helped make our memories enjoyable as they carried most of our belongings making our trek easier.Altogether the trip was something to remember.With the bonas of knowing that the company works to improve the social conditions in a sensible responsible way.Although we were an older couple I have confidence that any adult or any family with children could do a trek with this company. So discuss what level of trek would suit you needs."

Binod even gave up part of his day off to arrange additional activities and spend more time with our group. Customer care and service like that is very rare. An absolute highlight was the impromptu entertainment provided by our porters and guides on my birthday: a cake was couriered in by motorbike, and after traditional English celebrations, our porters and guides sang and danced.

I cant speak highly enough about our guides. Bassu (? spelling) for the cultural tour of Kathmandu. Thank you. Ram our main guide. You really made this trek remarkable and Nabi who assisted Ram & carried gear for the girls. All of you made this a great trip. We began with some white water rafting (great fun) before a couple of days in Chitawan exploring the landscape and culture, then our trek really began. Lots of climbing and descending. Spectacular scenery, beautiful local people and culture. Food was amazing in the villages and the accommodation along the way was of good standard, clean and comfortable. One of the best curries we have ever tasted was on our last night out before finishing the trek. You definitely need to bring a camera or two. If trekking then a sturdy back pack for all your gear (even if you don't carry it yourself), a day pack for daily personal needs along the way, water bottle and good walking shoes or boots. Boots are better. Its worth contacting the team before leaving home to help decide what clothing is needed. We were in shorts and T shirts most of the time, but it got cold on Poon Hill. (2 degrees); though we live in the tropics so anything under 20 degrees is cold.Overall it was a magnificent experience, made special by our guides and the people we traveled with. In fact we are already planning a longer 3-4 week trek with Himalayan Social Journeys and Ram Chandra (our guide) for the 2017 season. We definitely will be returning to Nepal and would recommend this experience to everyone. If you do one thing this life then trek Nepal with Himalayan Social Journey.

On the negative side, the white water rafting was a bit tame compared with what I did in New Zealand, but it was still enjoyable with a lovely setting, and my 14 year old son who had nothing to compare to enjoyed it. We did an optional Everest flight to view Mt Everest which didn't go as close as I expected and I felt it was a waste of money. On the positive side, the trip we did had a tremendous amount of variety, with accommodation varying from luxury to basic, good exposure to culture, as well as the natural attractions of Nepal. The trekking was more strenuous than expected. Unless you are accustomed to walking up and down hill(or you are young), it is challenging, but doable. There is never any rush so you can rest as much as you like. The optional paragliding in Pokhara is fun and worth doing. Everything was well organized by Himalayan Social Journey who were very flexible and provided an excellent guide named Narayan who was always cheerful and helpful. We didn't see much earthquake damage at all except for some of the old monuments in Kathmandu, and never at any time felt we were unsafe in Nepal. Overall the trip provided great exposure to a country and culture totally different to our own(Australia). The Nepalese people really need tourists to return to Nepal to help their economy so if you are thinking of going there then I would say do it."

Varanasi is an ancient city on the Ganges and I found it fascinating. We had an excellent driver who was with us for most of the trip. Not only was he a good driver but a complete gentleman. In each city we had a new guide and most were pleasant and informative. My recommendation would be to take the flights from Agra to Varanasi instead of the overnight train.

It was organised from start to finish by Himilayan Social Journey and we literally didn't have to think of anything. We were picked up from the airport and dropped to our hotel even though we weren't starting the trek for a couple more days. We had a one day sightseeing trip around with the wonderful Basu who was so lovely and informative before starting our trip the next day with our guide Shankar and porter Pradip.They were so helpful and friendly and always had a smile on their faces and made sure we got on the bus Chtiwan at the end of the trek and surprised us by meeting us off the bus again when we got back to Kathmandu which was such a lovely surprise.I can't recommend Nepal enough. It is such a beautiful country and I have so many great memories form there and the people we met. I am planning on going back in the next couple of years and will definitely be organising my trip through this company. I was so impressed in every aspect and already can't wait to return."

We are just back from a 15 day trek and jungle safari with Himalayan Social Journey and I must say they bent over backwards to make sure we had a great and relaxing time, even while on the steep mountains. We were very lucky to have a small group (2 of us as a couple and 1 other man) and our guide Shankar and porter Pradip really added to the experience. Shankar always kept us informed and entertained while Pradip carried over 30 kilos around the Poonhill circuit with a smile on his face throughout. Even when I got a nasty stomach bug, Shankar got me a bed in one of the tea houses for an hour and was happy to delay our progress, luckily I managed to go on but they were true friends on the trip. They made sure we caught the train to Chitwan and even surprised us by meeting us back in Kathmandu at the end and insisting on carrying our bags. We were very lucky that it was so quiet but this was not good for Nepalese tourism. I would urge people to use this company and not be afraid of any safety issues. It is 100% safe, the weather was amazing (except at 3,200m, bring a jacket) and the whole experience was made super easy for us by this company. There are some super deals to be had right now and we will never forget our experience on the mountain or in Chitwan. Every Nepalese person we came across was full of smiles, a friendly 'namaste' and always had tea, beer or dal bhat/momos at the ready. Even with a fuel crisis and a problematic new constitution, we were never delayed or put out due to Shankar, Pradip and everyone at Social Journey's efforts to help us. Special mention to Dilap, our Kathmandu driver who managed to keep enough petrol to get us around the city and to and from the airport. Niall- Ireland"

This tour is a perfect way to get a taste of everything Nepal has to offer, from the colourful and busy streets of Kathmandu, the jungle area and wildlife of Chitwan to the breathtaking mountains of the Annapurna range - you will definitely go on a journey and see the different cultures, way of life and welcoming residents.HSJ has been an extremely reliable company, who puts the customer at the centre of their business. Nothing is too much trouble, and the most important thing for them is to ensure that you enjoy your holiday no matter what it takes.The staff are AWESOME - thanks to Basu for his informative tour of Kathmandu, this guy really knows his stuff; Shankar who was our guide, and spent the most time with us, ensuring we were comfortable at every stage; Binod who was our porter for the trek, and always had a smile, and Ram, the M.D. who operates this commendable enterprise.You will enjoy every moment in Nepal, especially if you travel with an open heart and mind, and accept that the people who are looking after you are doing their very best to ensure your enjoyment of their beautiful county.

We have done a lot of travel and often find unscrupulous tour companies but this one is first rate. Our entire journey was organised successfully by Ram and his staff. His trekking guides and porters know their stuff, are good at English and bent over backwards to help us. We are 53 year olds and they slowed the walking pace to suit our fitness. All levels are catered for. We did some training before leaving Melbourne which certainly helped but even if we didn't, HSJ would have catered for this also. We only did 3 days of trekking but we certainly could have done more or even less. Thank you Binot and Ganess for your wonderful guiding and caring. HSJ offered to tailor a trek just for us and we found them very honest and versatile enough to change plans at the drop of a hat. If there was one negative it is the hotels during the trek. They are all around two star and have problems with power, hot water, etc. However this was not enough to bother us and this is not HSJ's fault, it's just the way things are in the Himalayas. Our Kathmandu tour guide Basu was both funny and knowledgable and our driver Dilip was very experienced. Thanks Ram for all your organisation. Overall 4 out of 5 for quality, price and variety.Regards,David and Mary Ann Ballard"

We spent the next few days trekking through the hillsides and villages, getting to see some of the earthquake damage firsthand. From there we stayed in Gorkha, Chitwan, and Pokhara, eventually getting to see a beautiful view of the Annapurna Himal range. Would highly recommend their services - they are very professional, and make the entire trip very easy and straightforward. Would travel with them again in a heartbeat.

We had a fabulous time and would encourage anyone to book and go now. Nepal needs tourism and the wonderful spirit of the Nepalese people in spite of their terrible experiences made us so glad to be there. Apparently so many people are cancelling or postponing their trips but we would say go now and enjoy the experience of a lifetime!The itinerary was very well planned and efficiently executed starting with our airport pickup and welcome at the Himalayan Social Journey office. We enjoyed the sightseeing of Kathmandu and our guide was amazing at answering our barrage of questions regarding culture, history, religion and obviously the impact of the earthquake. Some of the oldest buildings have been badly damaged and a few totally demolished but repairs are well under way and tourists should not be put off visiting.Traffic in Kathmandu is another amazing experience. All of the drivers that we had in the comfortable and air conditioned vehicles made us feel very safe in a system totally different to the UK! They were also very helpful and friendly and able to answer questions when there was no guide eg on the airport trips and to and from the extra white water rafting trip that we had booked.The hotel Holy Himalaya, Kathmandu, was a joy--brilliant location, comfortable and clean rooms, with hot water and flushing toilets (most appreciated on our return form the trek!) and very good food. And of course lovely staffWe felt so lucky to have Bisnu as our wonderful trek guide, and Tembe,our amazing porter. Bisnu knew everything about everything and has 25 years experience of trekking so we were completely confident putting ourselves in his hands. Some of the days were more challenging than others but as we were only a group of 3 we were able to go at our own pace and Bisnu even altered the destination on our returning days as we were going faster than he had anticipated (not so on the way up!)We achieved Everest Base Camp on the only afternoon that it rained on us, followed by snow overnight! The weather was otherwise fantastic, especially as it was the rainy season, and we awoke daily to blue sky and fabulous views, the clouds developing by the afternoon and the rain starting after our arrival at the guest houses. The evenings were cold and we were glad of our ski jackets in spite of the wood burning stoves in most of the guest houses.We took sleeping bag liners and although our porter carried sleeping bags for us we only needed them one night and felt that it was an unnecessary waste of our limited luggage allowance. Toilet paper however was in short supply and relatively expensive en route so take plenty! Also take chargers and adaptors as you can use them in most places. Head torches are essential for the guest houses that had outside toilets!The quality of the guest houses on the trek varied from excellent at Namche Bazaar to basic at Phakding and Pangboche, which was more what I expected. But the hospitality everywhere was wonderful.We would also highly recommend our Bhote Khoshe white water rafting experience. The rafting was good fun and the lunch provided was really tasty. The whole relaxed atmosphere at the camp base made us want to stay there for much longer. So do go. Book through Himalayan Social Journey. You will not regret it."

The areas we visited included downtown Kathmandu; Pokhara for a four day trek to Dhampus, Australian Camp and Sarangkot; Chitwan National Park and Nagarkot.During this time we were guided by Binod (Binnie) Dhakal. Binnie is an exceptional young man, passionate about his country and job. He gave an extremely informative and detailed account about the places we visited. He was most considerate of our older age and accommodated all our requests with enthusiasm and professionalism.Whilst on a four day trek of a short section of the Annapurna Circuit, Krishna ? was our porter. Krishna was an extremely capable and caring person. Sirma, the local guide, was terrific too. He was extremely informative about the four places that we visited included the Monkey Temple, Pashupatinath Temple, Boudhanath and Pantan Durbar Square.Dilip Simkhada, our driver to Nagarkot was an outstanding driver, negotiating windy roads to the mountainside town with caution and precision. Ram, the Office Manger was brilliant in promptly answering our many questions prior to arrival. The company was very accommodating to our change in travel plans to add Chitwan and Nagarkot to our itinerary after arriving in Kathmandu. Overall, it was an excellent holiday in which we learnt an extraordinary amount about Nepal. Whilst the damage of the April 25th earthquake is very much evident to dwellings around Thamel, Gorkha and Kodari, it is a safe place to travel with so much still to view. The resilience of the Nepalese people is extraordinary. We will encourage our friends and colleagues to utilise this company when visiting Nepal."

We were worried our tour were cancelled for that reason and contacted Himalayan Social, they assured us the tour was possible and they were happy to take us. As we arrived in Kathmandu we were informed that unfortunately every other person in the tour had cancelled and we would be going alone with our guide and porter. When we arrived in Lukla, our guide Bishnu and our porter Lakpa were already waiting for us and happy so meet us. The trek was sensational, Bishnu is a very knowledgable guide with 24 years + experience. Lakpa was also terrific, always taking the lead in the group. Hotels in Kathmandu were really good, well located in Thamel tourist area. The Hyatt nights included in our package were very relaxing.After our trek to Everest Basecamp, we book a trip to Chitwan and Pokhara which was not so good, and this is the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5. First the company insisted that we took the rafting activity which I am not a fan of, so we refused. I think it was a great decision, as when we travelled to join the group that did the rafting, we discovered this very polluted river that you wouldn't dare getting anywhere near. The trip to Chitwan by car was very long, as the roads are terrible around Nepal. Chitwan in May/June is terribly hot, and the abuse of elephants is present in every corner. The hotel \"Green Park Chitwan\" was very nice, but not all hotels offered have the same standards.Pokhara is a nice city, and we stayed in a nice hotel\"Mount Kailash\", although it was also very very hot. Had I known I would have changed this trip for a Tibet excursion instead. In general, Himalaya Social staff was very kind and helpful and accommodated to our needs.

They were accommodating of our schedule and needs, planned and executed great activities for us, and went above and beyond to make sure we had an enjoyable trip. We went rafting and hiking and loved these activities. Our guides were kind and willing to help with anything. Nepal was completely safe and the people and scenery were lovely. Thanks for a great time!"

            "review": "Amazing journey. This was one of life's amazing journeys. I was there during the quake, in Dingbouche village (2 days trekking from EBC) which was relatively unscathed thank god, but besides the worry of the quake, we were well looked after. The track is still passable. I was jealous this week to see our guide make it to EBC. We never made it to EBC, but did get one day away. Amazing experience, very comfortable accommodation (basic but comfortable), very attentive guides and porters. I was suffering altitude sickness and Bishnu constantly monitored everyone's condition. This is a great local run business and the guides and porters are worth their weight in gold. I booked and paid direct with HSJ and had no issues at all. I always received responses back on any questions very promptly. Also if looking for a good insurance company who covered up to 6000 metres for evacuation I can highly recommend World Nomads. After the quake I received 2 messages from them to guide me and provide information on what we needed to do if requiring additional accommodation, flights etc, very good service. To sum up, I would definitely go with HSJ again and recommend to my friends and if I had the time would return to do the EBC trek tomorrow. I hear there's plenty of people still going, and in fact as we were returning, we passed plenty of people still going up the mountain."

            "review": "Nepal - A memorable experience!. My son and I arrived in Nepal on 15th May wondering if travel to Nepal was appropriate after the devastation of recent tragic earthquakes. Throughout the 14 days stay 'locals' constantly thanks us for coming and expressed the wish that other tourists would soon follow. Upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport, our main guide Binod and a driver from Himalayan Social Journey were waiting to take us to a briefing and our first nights hotel. My bags with trekking gear somehow missed the flight and we had to wait 24 hours for luggage to arrive. Ram from HSJ changed our itinerary so that nothing from the arranged tour would be missed. First night was in a reasonably comfortable hotel in Kathmandu before a flight to Pokhara and a night in a very comfortable resort. The next 6 days were spent trekking through the Annapurna foothills. Lovely scenery, basic accommodation and a few challenging hills. Highlights included amazing mountains in the background, a visit to hot springs for an early morning relax, and not forgetting Pradeep our porter. Back to Pokhara for sightseeing, relaxation and a little shopping. Next stop Chitwan where we stayed at a resort named Hotel Seven Star. Great staff, food and pool. Activities included elephant trek; canoe down river with crocs; walk through forest being the home of rhinos, tigers, bears and lots of other wild and wonderful animals. From Chitwan we headed back to Kathmandu by road with a break mid way for white water rafting and lunch. It's a long drive (about 7 hours). Very slow! Until our return to a Kathmandu for the final 2 nights, we were fortunate to have Binod as our guide and organiser. Binod's constant attention, his knowledge of the trekking area and Chitwan, greatly added to our memorable experience.Finally, HSJ arranged a tour of Kathmandu cultural sites with guide Basu. Basu is a great communicator/story teller whose commentary gave a valuable insight into the history, development and religions of Kathmandu. We saw devastation in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, thousands living under tarpaulins, early reclamation and reconstruction, and a community wanting to get back to business. As tourists we were 'not in the way'. We have come away with the belief that much of the country is ready and waiting for tourism. Particularly trekking areas and cities to the west which are geologically more stable. Keep Nepal on the must see list!"

            "review": "Excellent trek - great people. Prior to me booking the trek, I sent a number of emails to the company seeking various information as Nepal was totally new to me. HSJ responded to each email very quickly, often on the same day. This gave me a level of confidence in the company which was subsequently confirmed on the actual trek. My brother and I were part of a small group (6 people) that did the 7-day Poon Hill trek. We had no problems with being picked up at the airport, despite me arriving a few days early and my brother on the allocated date. Ram, the manager, met us the day before the trek to finalise requirements and to formally introduce our guide Binod (Binny) Dhakal (who we had actually met at the airport). Binney and our three porters, Akkal Thapa, Santosh Dhakal and Krishna Timalshina, provided excellent service to us. Binny is very good, and I think the company should consider him for a managerial role in the company. The level of commitment to us by them was extraordinary when you consider that when the 25 April earthquake occurred (within the first hour or so of the trek), and they became aware that Binney's parents had lost their home and that Akkal and Krishna's homes were destroyed - none knew whether their families had survived. Santosh (single) also lost his house. They refused to call off the trek, saying we were their guests. There is no higher level of commitment to a client that I can think of. They were, naturally, extremely worried, however, once word came through (a couple of days later) that their families were save, they relaxed much more. Still, extremely difficult in the circumstances.The guesthouses we stayed at were pretty average, however, appeared better than others available in each village. It must be remembered that the trek goes through rural villages, so saying 'average' shouldn't be taken as a negative. I believe we got the best available. In any event, it all adds to the adventure. The food at each of the guesthouses, whether where we stayed or along the way, was good. Drinkable water is available at all guesthouses, which are no more than 30-60 minutes apart.We also went to Chitwan with no issues. We told Binny not to come with us so he could go back to his family. He made all arrangements for us and everything went extremely well.We found Himalaya Social Journey to be very competitive in its prices. I thoroughly recommend this company to anyone going on a Nepali trek."

It was our first time to Nepal and we were over awed with the friendliness, hospitality and efficiency of all concerned.We trekked the Poon Hill circuit with 6 other travellers, a Guide (Binod Dhakal) and 4 Porters (Krishna, Purha, Ganash & Ayush).We could not have had better people to share our experiences with. Binod displayed incredible leadership abilities with just the right mix of flexibility, experience, concern and firmness.Our porters were just brilliant! What lovely people. They didn't just carry our packs, but looked after our every wish, both on the track and at the tea houses where we stayed at night.As for our fellow trekkers - what can I say, except that they were fantastic. They always kept us amused and helped in no small way to make our experience of Nepal what it was.We have done a lot of travelling around the world, but for us, this experience just cannot be surpassed!Well done also to Ram, Manager of Himalayan Social Journey. None of this would have eventuated without his drive & organisation."

We were only on day 3 when the earthquake struck: we were scared and clueless (same group as Jared C, I totally concur with his review). He went out of his way to make our entire group not only feel safe, but be safe. Day 4: he ran from Tengboche to Deboche and back again to confirm that our hotel was safe. He kept our team intact, the porters were understandably concerned about their own family and homes, yet they put our interests first. Ganga also mentored our assistant guide, Bir, who markedly gained self-confidence and knowledge as each day went by. Ganga and Bir, gave us 5 star treatment the entire time, even though the facilities are modest (I really don't want or expect the facilities to be any different). In summary, we achieved what we set out to do, all on schedule despite the challenges that might have been with flights, accommodation etc. Ram runs a very professional company - proof that even in an earthquake he had fully functioning services and connections to all the supporting services, pick-ups, hotels, insurance companies etc. While the Himalayas are magnificent, the stand-out highlight of Nepal for me was the team of people in Himalayan Social Journey that we had the pleasure and fun to be with."

From the moment we booked our Trip With Himalayan Social Journey everything was as smooth as it could be.Ram (Managing Director) was in continual contact with us ensuring they were there to pick us up for all Airport Transfers which are all included in the cost.Even when we had to change the dates of our trek due to business at home, this was not a problem at all.As soon as we arrived at Kathmandu Airport, we were greeted by Santosh, who took us to our hotel. Santosh also ended up being a Porter on our trek.The night before our trek we met our Guide - Binod, who came to our hotel and explained how the trek would happen.The entire trek went like clock work. On Day 1 of our trek the devastating earthquake hit Nepal. Unfortunately, each of our Guides and Porters lost their houses but luckily their family were ok. We encouraged them to go home to their families and we could look at another time for the trek, but they were so focused on pleasing us that we continued.Thank you to Binod (Binny). Your knowledge of the Annapurna area during our trek was truly amazing, and we got SO much out of listening to you. You truly are an asset to HSJ. You showed great leadership to the entire team, who clearly respect you.Santosh (Cheeky Boy), you definitely were the life of the party. You have a real passion for what you do, and you will definitely get to be the guide you want to be.Krishna & Akkal - thank you for the tremendous work you did carrying our things, It was a privilege to spend the whole trek with you, and thank you for coming along with us when you should have been with your families - we really appreciated it.Anyone considering a trek with HSJ - GO FOR IT. They really aim to please their clients, and make sure they learn all they can about Nepal.We had a couple in a trek that had not prepared for the challenges of walking the Annapurna Range - Binod did a great job managing their issues without it affecting the rest of the group. A true testament to the guide he is.Binod, Santosh, Krishna & Akkal - THANK YOU and we hope to see you again.Ram - Thanks for organising it all for us :-)"

There was much terror, panic and confusion on the mountain. Thankfully, we were under the leadership of our smart and quietly brilliant guide Ganga Thapa. Ganga got us to base camp safely and kept us all calm and reassured throughout the hike. He is an extraordinary person and has a rich knowledge of the himalayas. The trek is mind blowing beautiful. The people and culture enrich the experience. The trip is very organised (even with an earthquake) Be prepared to find life very difficult above 4200M. Request for Ganga, he is a legend."

Started in Kathmandu with a tour of the City; collected by private car and guide arrived nice and early for an informative day around the major site seeing attractions.Off to Chitwan for Jungle Safari, Elephant-back Safari, Canoe down the river, bird watching, and a peaceful resort. Madan, the local guide was amazing; very knowledgeable and receptive to the many many questions.From Chitwan to Pokhara to start trekking; this is when Shankar our guide really came in to his own - excellent guide, willing to learn, happy to help, and just an all round great guy. He was teamed up with Dharma, the inspirational 50year old porter, that could burst a move uphill when he wanted.Amazing 6 days trekking; food was great, accommodation comfortable, views amazing, birdlife fantastic, company great, and the fact it was just the girlfriend and I with the guide and porter made the trip very flexible and convenient. Had a wonderful time. Make sure you ask for Shankar as a guide if you head over - he truly is a great guy!Had a wee look around Pokhara before heading back to Kathmandu. En route we stopped for white water rafting. This is where we hit only one of two minor glitches of the holiday. We were told that transport was included but were asked to pay $50 for private transport to and from rafting, or take public bus with all baggage (that was not advised) so we just paid the money; Rameshwar the manager made the decision for this and we were sure to voice our displeasure over it. I advise double checking for hidden costs with this man.Back to Kathmandu, and to be honest, one day was enough. Having been in peace and quiet (and cleanliness) of Annapurna range, the city was a little overwhelming - I would advise Kathmandu for a day and no longer - use it as a stopover point. Once you've had one day/night of it - consider it done!I mentioned two downsides to the trip; don't eat the meat served. We're Westerners and not ready for that kind of gut challenge - you've been warned. I thought I had an iron stomach...it took me 5 days of antibiotics to get over that one. Not nice!!All in all, 95% fantastic trip and experience. The guides, the private cars to and from site seeing, airport pickup and drop off, safari, animals (crocs, boar and sika deer), rafting, and trekking, all amazing. Try to forget the wee bumps on the way and it was well worth the money we paid - we were a groupon special (\u00a3500). Wouldn't like to pay anymore as everything is so cheap; rooms around \u00a31-5/night on the trek and food between \u00a33-7 per day, so don't spend too much. But do have a guide, otherwise you'll be pestered at every stop.Pleased we've done it. May be back, but only to where we know; miss Kathmandu, hit Chitwan, go more adventurous on the trek (base camp perhaps) and a night in Pokhara before the airport."

The managing Director Ram met us at the hotel on arrival and the excellent service just continued from that point. Sight seeing around Kathmandu by local guide Basu was an educational marvel. The trek guide Sherpa Mingmar and porter Umess perhaps arguably were the best to have on any trek and cannot thank them enough for providing excellent service throughout the journey and their friendship will be a lasting memory. We experienced nearly every weather condition you can imagine and we accepted what mother nature threw at us. Luckily we were prepared clothing wise for all weather which constantly changed throughout each day. The lodges and meals along the way were of a high standard letting us experience the local foods and hospitality. A few of out group experienced a touch of altitude sickness but Mingmar Sherpa kept a constant eye and monitored everyone's condition. A great trek for anyone wishing adventure and challenges as it remains a lasting memory for me.Thankyou Mingmar Sherpa, Umess and Ram and team at Himalayan Social Journey."

We liked the idea that going through a local company rather than a big corporate may benefit the local people more but were apprehensive as to how we would go with the booking process. Any concerns we had were quickly dispelled with the ease at which the arrangements were made through email. The staff at HSJ were very prompt at replying to all the emails I sent and any final clarification was easily done over the phone. So confident did we become of the booking process that we even asked them to organise a Bhutan trip to start after our Everest Base Camp trek. This again was organised with the utmost ease. In Nepal we did the 16 Day Everest Base Camp trek package. Transfers from Kathmandu airport were smooth but when we got dropped off at the hotel we were not given any information on the orientation meeting. This was easily clarified by a phone call placed by the friendly hotel staff to the agency but this would be one of the rare occasions HSJ could have improved on its communication. Our guide for the trek was Bishnu and we could not have asked for a better guide! From negotiating the mayhem that is the domestic airport to making sure all our needs and whims during the trek were attended to, Bishnu and his team of Sherpas and porters were beyond exemplary. A few examples of their good work that jump to mind:1. Always being patient in managing the different personalities in our 9 person group. 2. Carrying the day packs of some members of our group when they were struggling with illness and the more challenging days of the trek. 3. On the day we had planned to hike to Everest Base Camp (EBC), it started snowing. There was a very real chance we were not able to make it to EBC after all the hard trekking we had done and the group felt shattered. Bishnu enlisted the help of 2 of our porters to help guide us to EBC in the snow and make our dreams come true. We actually had to descend in the dark but I felt perfectly safe knowing Bishnu and his team were guiding us. The porters actually carried the daypacks and held the hands of some members the whole way down and in some tricky spots would be running back and forth to guide more members. This ended up being a 12 hour day for his team and the easy option for him would have been to simply say to us that the weather was not conducive to the trek but he made sure all of us made it to EBC and made it back safely. 4. We were stranded in Lukla as the weather was not permitting our flights back to Kathmandu. When Bishnu realised we were due to fly out to Bhutan the next morning he did everything in his power to ensure we got on the earliest flight out of Lukla the next day so we could make our Bhutan connection. Short of being able to control the weather, he could not have done anything more!These were just a few examples and there are plenty more. The only criticism I have of the trek was the accommodation we stayed in near EBC: in particular Tengbouche/ Dabouche, Labouche and Pheriche. The state/ ratio of the toilets in those accommodation was appalling even by Nepalese standards. EBC trek is definitely not for the faint-hearted. You are pushed to your limits physically and mentally, then asked to do more the next day. But along the way you will discover your inner strength and resilience and share a life-changing experience with new friends who you seem to have known forever after just 2 weeks. And with Bishnu and his team, you can be certain you will be well looked after every step and Diamox tablet of the way!"

He knew his stuff, took care of us in slippery footing, and ensured our safety all the way. He was also Master of Ceremonies after dinner with his magic Card tricks! He's worthy of Las Vegas! He has done Annapurna Base Camp and Everest Base Camp so was full of interesting stories. He also helped us get the last equipment needed for the trek. Get this man to take you! He organised any changes we needed...Mobile coverage in Nepal is to be seen to be believed!For those thinking of doing this, please consider buying the majority of your gear there in country, Pokhara had many shops with all the gear and they are much cheaper than Oz. For people who are doing this only occasionally, it's a cheaper option and is good for the Nepali business economy.We had a full cultural tour with Basu, who took us to the World Heritage Stupas. He was a spiritual man, and we also had the opportunity to buy beautiful objects and visit Thanka art studios where they make beautiful Mandelas. Basu, I went back after our trek and bought a beautiful singing bowl from the Old Tibetan Singing Bowl Shop, where he showed us all about them. I wanted to tell you that when we were at Swayambhunath I noticed the chiselled lines on the paving stones were there to stop us slipping, but it seemed they became lines of script at times, and I thought it right to walk to a place of worship on the prayers and hopes of the faithful.Our accommodation was great. Hotel Tibet, a quiet haven, Mount Kailash in Pokhara lovely, and Hyatt Regency wonderful to end on. For Dhampus, Australian Camp, and Sarankot, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of accommodation, having expected trekking conditions to be a bit harder. Have to say all those mountain ladies can COOK! Drinks are available readily if you want that sort of thing. But the FOOD! We ate our way round the Annapurna foothills! They provided a wide variety of all nationalities, which was amazing.Did the Paragliding with Sarankot Paragliding. Prem, pilot extrordinaire, took an old lady from 1800 metres and it was something else! Rockstar Prem!Ram Parshad Sapkota came personally to give us a briefing, Thank you Ram Rameshwar, the manager answered every email promptly. Namaste Rameshwar! Baburam, our porter was awesome. He's a young man who helped us with cheer. And finally, but not least, our company driver 'D'. Anyone who's been in Khatmandu traffic, will know whereof I speak. Nepali drivers are AWESOME! \"D\", thanks. You took us all over and I could have watched the traffic for ages, what a sight! You guys know how to MERGE!Perhaps the weather was not conducive to seeing the mountains in their entirety, but they appeared as if by magic from the clouds and were amazing. It didn't matter, they are still so beautiful. Some places in the world are Spirit Country, and this is one.Recommend it!? Sure can! Just once at least!"

The porters were friendly and enjoyed themselves along the way as well.The views of Annapurna were spectacular when there were no clouds, the rhododendrons were in full flower at this time of the year (march-april) which hade the hills all the more beautifull. The guesthouses along the trek do a great meal and very well priced, and very friendly.Overall Nepal is a wonderful country and Himalayan Social Journey is the company to see it with.Very highly recommended."

I've just finished a three week trip to Nepal which included a seven day trek through the Annapurna foothills organised by Himalayan Social Journey. Brilliant! I'm 58 and reasonably fit but it was quite a challenge at times, though always worth it. Ram (director of the company) and Binod (dear Binny - our guide) and ALL the porters were so helpful, kind, considerate, knowledgeable (when language would allow) and fun - when music was involved. If there was a particularly hard part, maybe with a little too many steps, there was always an amazing view to reward, or a waterfall around the next corner or a wild flower we hadn't seen before, another steep hillside with so very many rhododendrons that its breath taking or of course a snow covered mountain within reach .. almost. I've fallen in love with Nepal, it's kind sweet natured people, its art and craft, subsistence agriculture and paddock to plate cuisine (gotta love dal baht!!). Thanks to Ram and his drivers, guides and porters - it was made easier to do. I'd recommend this trip to folk who are fit but also recommend you research so that you find out the details like: it's steep, challenging, not luxurious and it's just the best possible 'holiday' to have. Thanks again Ram for your extraordinary organisational skills (which match this extraordinary country) and to Binny our guide. much love - from Australia."

            "review": "Unexpected end to trek. I reckon it's time I gave Himalayan Social Journey the huge pat on the back it deserves for looking after me during my Ghorepani-Poon Hill trek in February, especially to the managing director, Ram Sapkota, my guide on the trek, Dhakal Binod, and the unnamed helicopter pilot with the Internet handle \"Vertical Freedom\".Helicopter pilot? Oh yeah - I had to be evacuated from Chuile near Tadipani on Day 4 of the trek after I slipped on some black ice and broke my ankle.The fall actually took place the previous day, a few hours after leaving Ghorepani, but I thought it was \"just\" a sprain and limped on to Tadipani that night. The next morning, loaded with painkillers and with ankle taped, I continued. I thought I'd be able to manage but after an hour or so it was obvious that I couldn't. Binod had stayed close and he suggested he'd call for a helicopter when we got to Chuile - and before then I had to be carried for a couple of hundred metres over particularly rough ground.The rest of the trekkers, Nick, Jock, Mel, Ian, Graham and Joy, said goodbye and carried on and I was left behind, all grumpy because at this stage the toughest part of the trek was over and I'd been looking forward to a much easier time. The trek was actually a challenge to myself for my 70th birthday, and I guess I succeeded, despite being flown out on my actual birthday (what a present).It was certainly easier getting back to Kathmandu, although a bit scary when the helicopter pilot who picked me up put Binod down at the next scheduled stop so he could catch up with the other trekkers. I've been in helicopters quite a few times but had never before been in one that landed on a tiny mountain terrace such as that one in the Himalayas.Vayodha Hospital in Kathmandu was brilliant (except for the food). After a full check-up with X-rays and scans I was told I had a spiral fracture of the fibula and needed a plate inserted to hold it together. All told I was in hospital for four days. (My orthopedic surgeon back in Brisbane told me they'd done a first-class job.)Ram ensured that someone was available to give whatever help I needed and when it was time for my discharge provided cars and drivers to take me to and from my hotel so I could organise my flight home. There were logistical complications, including unexpected flight changes, but Ram never faltered or complained - he just got on with it and made things work.So, thanks again to all the team in Nepal. You were brilliant.And I mustn't forget to mention that the part of the trek that didn't involve my evacuation was excellent as well. All the guys from Himalayan Social Journey were helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The trek was challenging, so if you're interested, make sure you're fit for climbing. Going up about 1500m in a day doesn't sound too tough . . . but when you consider there are nearly as many down sections as up sections, well, you're probably climbing twice that. A couple of times I thought I wouldn't make it but I did, which is why I was so grumpy when it all had to end. Despite the accident I'm glad I did the trek."

From the moment my flight touched down at Kathmandu airport I saw the beaming smile of the Himalayan staff member waiting for me. I was whisked to Himalayan Social Journey office. All I could see were lovely faces with beaming smiles. I was treated like royalty. It seems like everbody was expecting me including Ram, the lovely and very charming managing director of the company. At 5pm that evening the group met for the first time. Our trip was discussed in details and each request noted. We also met our ever smiling guide Ganga. What a delightful man. Nothing too much trouble. He never forgets a request, ever. People, at times, can be demanding but I never saw a hint of annoyance. He was the guide, the problem solver, at times the agony aunt. Since I have a problem with climbing steps, he held my hand and encouraged me with every step, I am not talking about a few steps, I am talking about, sometimes, 6 hours of him pushing me every step of the way. I mean it when I say I could never have done it without Ganga. Binod, the 2nd guide also stayed with me for hours after everybody arrived to the destination with Binod singing lovely tunes to keep me entertained. I am in awe of these people, in fact I am in awe of the Nepalese people in general. Despite their poverty, they are very proud people, they are always happy to see you, eager to please and never expecting anything in return. The porters carried huge bags on their backs, always with smiles on their faces. I felt humble. This experience, these people taught me a lot about myself. I will never complain or worry about petty things. I will always remember this journey and these people as one of the best thing that happened in my life. Thank you Ganga, Ram. Binod, and each porter including my mountain man Bimsim who at one stage he saw me stumble and offered to carry me on his back. You are my hero \u263a\u263a"

We were so grateful and had an amazing trek! When we returned, we had breakfast with Ram to discuss what to do with the rest of our holiday. He gave us many options and within an hour he had planned a whole knew holiday for us to fit our remaining time in Nepal. He managed to organise us a flight (that same morning) to Pokhara, return flight back to Kathmandu, hotel accommodation in Pokhara (great location!), a bungee jump experience, a paragliding experience and all transfers (free transfers).

We had signed up for the 10D9N guided tour but as we wanted to spend more time in Nepal, we decided to travel to Nepal 5 days before the start of the guided tour. As this was the first time in Nepal for the both of us, we had approached Ram from HJS to provide recommendations on places that we can visit during our additional days. Ram went beyond that and promptly helped us plan a 5-day itinerary which included sightseeing at Bhaktapur and treks and stays at beautiful places such as Nagarkot & Chisapani. We also managed to visit Thamel which was a 10-minute walk from Hotel Tibet (where we stayed) in Kathmandu.The accommodation and meals at the lodges (at Nagarkot & Chisapani) were beyond satisfactory and HJS ensured that the places we stayed at had the best views of the mountain range. The hosts at the lodges were also very warm and friendly. We felt like we were at home.The activities plannned in our itinerary during the 10D guided tour was diverse - city sightseeing in Kathmandu (Hindu & Buddhist temples), whitewater rafting along Trisuli River, canoeing, jungle trekking and elephant ride in Chitwan, trekking at Dampus, paragliding at Sarangkot and boating at Fewa Lake in Pokhara. Also, the itinerary was well-paced and hence, we had ample time to get some shopping done and exploring of the various places on our own. We felt relaxed and at the same time we felt very happy to have done the different types of activities.It was great pleasure to meet the wonderful HJS team in Nepal. We had a terrific holiday and Nepal is simply amazing. But none of that would have been possible without the help and all the efforts put in by the HJS team from the planning stage up to the very last minute that we left. Special mention and our sincere thanks to our guides Prakash Rijal, Binod Dhakal, the porters: Binod Ghastri, Santosh Devkota, Sudip & Mohan and the drivers: Bala & Dilip. Prakash was ever-ready to help when we had to make some minor changes to our itinerary even though we were travelling as a group during the guided tour. The porters too were very patient and encouraging when we were were slowing down during the treks. Not to mention the jokes, songs and laughter that was shared everyday. We felt incredibly lucky to have met such lovely people during our time in Nepal. Personally, we felt very happy and satisfied with everything that was done during our trip and we can't wait to come back.Thanks once again to HJS for everything that they have helped us with in making this a memorable trip for us and treating us as family. Dhanyabad! Hope to see you again in the near future! :)"

Went to temples for all the sightseeing which I'm not really interested in as I'm not the religious kind of person. But the temples are nice. I think those spiritual/religion people will love it. Transportation wise, since I was alone and just finished my white water rafting(I was wet and didn't managed to change as there's no changing room and were were at the roadside) we had to take public transport to chitwan. It was very uncomfortable and the bus was really squeezy. But for the rest of the journey, I took the tourist bus. Quite an experienced actually. Food wise, they're a lot of varieties quite delicious too! The view at dhampus and sarangkot was breathtaking. Really enjoyed my 2 nights staying at the lodge. Overall it was good."

From the moment I landed in Nepal to the moment i left, Ram, Binod and the rest of the Himalayan Social Journey's team went above and beyond to organise accommodation, customised day trips and anything else i needed. I went through them just for the 14 day Rafting, Trekking & Yoga trip (which mind you was fantastic) but once in Nepal ended up booking everything through Himalayan Social.There pricing is super competitive (give them a call or email once you pick your trip from the website, they regularly have specials) and they will customise side trips for you if you don't find what you are looking for on their site.The best bit of my trip to Nepal was the friends and now extended family i made through the team at Himalayan Social Journey!"

I wouldn't have gone had I known that because I am over temples and cathedrals and churches.

Weather was great the whole time we were there. We went with our friends and met 5 other people on the trip. Our guide Binod and the porters Ganesh, Bikash, Krishna and Ayush were absolutely fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better crew. Everything about the full trip was fantastic and so well organised. From booking the trip and asking many questions with quick responses from Shamila to being met at the airport (after being delayed a couple of hours) by our friendly guide Binod. One of our best ever holidays although the 6 day trek was far from easy. Do some preparation if you are thinking of going. There are thousands of steps up and down but the trek was so worth it with views to die for. Food amazing although accommodation basic but we are not complaining. We all enjoyed the full experience especially the rafting. Visit to Chitwan also excellent with friendly guide Madan who knew his wildlife. Only downside was a visit to the elephant breeding centre at Chitwan which was not good as these poor elephants were shackled by the ankle to a chain and could not move. This place needs closing down. However this was not HSJ fault although they could stop offering trips there. Elephant safari was ok as at least these animals get to move. We all loved Nepal and will return. The Nepalese people we met were so friendly. Would definitely use HSJ to arrange another trip. Thank you so much Ram for giving us a holiday of lifetime and thank you for employing such good people - they are a credit to your company. Darrell and Karen"

Having always wanted to trek in the Nepalese mountains my experience in the Annapurna Ranges was amazing. Weather (late Oct) - perfect; Scenery - beautiful; Tea House Accommodation - basic but adequate (don't expect to have hot showers & you will be delighted if one available); Food - tasty and plenty of it; Trek - challenging but so worthwhile & porters assist if need be (my 60 year old knees were complaining on the last downhill day and I had a porter constantly walking alongside in case I needed help). The porters are incredible - carrying our heavy bags, serving food and entertaining us with singing and dancing each evening - all done with happy smiles! Tip - take extra battery supply for your camera/phone as charging facilities are in high demand at the tea houses.If anyone is considering visiting Nepal - do it - and do it with Himalayan Social Journey."

A wise decision as we had a seven hour delay to land at Khatmandu (landed at 11.30pm) because of the weather. It was a welcoming sight to see our tour rep. The Samsara Resort Hotel, our base in Khatmandu after the tour as well, was clean, comfortable, quiet - considering it's location - had a nice garden to relax in. On booking this tour direct from the UK, we were geared up to be with a group, so was very surprised that we were the only ones in the group. At the time, somewhat disappointed by that, but thankful later on it was the case. So, for the rest of the trip we had a personal guide and porter that looked after us very well. The tour of Bhaktapur and Khatmandu was excellent, very informative. The itenerary was changed to suit our needs, we declined the rafting experience. Also, after discovering the second day's trek to Gohrepani was difficult for us, our route was changed. Our guide Bikash, was very patient and encouraged us to carry on, but slowly. Glad we did, the views were spectacular. We particularly liked the activities on the visit to Chitwan National Park. The hard bed at the Heritage Hotel was the only down side. The Hotel at Pokhara, Splendid View, was central and OK. The lodges along the trek were basic and OK once one accepted that level of comfort. All accommodation depends on what you pay. Being vegetarians, we were pleasantly surprised by the variety of food on offer at the Lodges and plenty of it. Worth noting that the roads are not very good and the bus trips are tiring. We flew back from Pokhara to Khatmandu, a half hour trip, rather than an eight hour road trip!!! On the whole it was an enjoyable experience, especially the Nepalase hospitality and specifically that of our guide, Bikash. We would definitely recommend Himalayan Social Journey for your Nepal experience."

My husband and I booked this via a special offer so we were a little apprehensive...however be assured HSJ is a good choice and you will be looked after. Binod was our tour guide and I cannot speak highly enough of him, Binod was so helpful to me (I needed special attention) as I am not very good or skilled with heights (trekking the Himalayas perhaps not the ideal choice) however, he always looked after me...taking my hand when necessary to lead the way. We had such an amazing time with our fellow trekkers and porters too. This is the first time my husband and I have participated in a tour group and what a pleasant surprise it was. The facts, the food choice in the mountains is surprisingly good...Binod and our porters worked hard to ensure our food came out as ordered, at the same time and also arranged the bill paying at the end. Amazing! Accommodation, basic to more than basic, probably depends on the size of your group.. the smaller the group perhaps more choice We were a relatively small group with 8 trekkers, 4 delightful, fit, friendly, porters and one exceptional guide! Poon Hill the highlight of many. Ensure you prepare by doing some steps and some long bush walks 2-3 months prior (unless you are very fit then you will be fine) as this will ensure you can enjoy your trek...just slowly slowly and all will be well. I don't want to sound too gushy but honestly my husband and I travel a lot and rarely write reviews so be assured this review is very genuine. I must mention our porters, Santosh (soon to be a guide), Krishna, Brimsen, Pradip and of course Binod, the head the family. Sincere thanks."

The 14 day Kathmandu, W. Water Rafting, Chitwan, Annapurna Trek and Pokara itinerary was a great introduction to Nepal. At no stage did we feel rushed, and Binod proved a quietly efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable guide. This is a great trip if you have not visited Nepal before, as it combines so much. Climbing to 3,300 can be a struggle if you have been living at sea level, and other parts of the Annapurna circuit which we did not visit, are over 5,000 meters. You need to be fitter than you think !A wonderful holiday, super people to plan and travel with, I can't recommend this company enough. Himalayan Social Journey Rocks !!Richard Bell ... Australia"

Strongly recommend it if trekking is your thing, but make sure you have a great level of fitness to enjoy a lot more the journey. It's long, physically demanding and the higher you go the harder it gets. Unfortunately, hygiene is very poor in those areas so take extra caution with what you eat and drink.

Our porters Binod Ghastri & Bhimsen Banjara were always laughing and joking and we were the envy of every other group because of the wonderful relationship that had grown between us that wasn't evident with other trekkers and their guides & porters. Saran taught us a Nepalese card game which we played every night with him, the porters and our two lovely travelling companions from Thailand.We are 50 plus and spent time training for the trek which we strongly advise you to do! Especially going up and down steps. We were fortunate to have two lovely Thai girls in our group and though they were much younger than us, we got on really well and have become good friends. To sum up no photo can do justice to the beauty and majesty of these mountains, it was worth every hard step of the way.

The local people I met along the way were also extremely helpful and friendly Thanks very much Himalayan Social journey."

We found Ram & his team easy to deal with & professional. Our head guide Bishnu Basnet, 2nd guide DePok & their team were friendly & helpful, nothing was too much trouble. When during a long day of trekking I didn't know how we would make it, Bishnu gave us encouragement & a warm smile that urged us to carry on. When a few in our trekking family were ill & needed evacuation I was amazed at Bishnu's care & professional handling of their medi/vac to Kathmandu. We would defiantly recommend trekking with this company. They made our trek easier with their caring attitude and support every minute of the day. Amazing friends were made both within our group & with our HSJ team. Thank you all. These fantastic memories will stay with us forever!!! Pauline & Jack - Australia"

I did a 14 day trek to everest base camp and the guide Nharam was fantastic. He gave us all the advice we needed to keep going and none of us got altitude sickness. Plus he was always there for a laugh. We had three porters who I couldn't have made it without. This was a trip of a lifetime that would not have been the same without himalayan social journey. Highly recommend."

Our 11 days trip was very well arranged by Himalayan Social Journey based on our budget and we got to see little and different parts of Nepal which includes 2 days of trekking. The experience and the service from the start from the whole HSJ team was awesome. The places we stayed at were clean and strategically located, definitely value for money. We also got to learn more about the country and the people with the local knowledge generously shared by all our guides (we had a different one for each city and trekking). Highlight of the trip was definitely the trekking, albeit only 2 days but it was a memorable experience. Our porter (Binod) and guide (Raju) looked after us and ensured that we not only enjoyed ourselves but also found laughter in every step that we took, even during the uphill ones. It's the little things that counts - chillies with soy sauce served with every meal (something I had been craving for), songs, jokes and a nudge whenever we were getting tired. In merely hours, they became our friends. Thank you to everyone involved in our trip, dhanyabad to all of you. I would definitely recommend this company."

Ram ensures you are always supported by someone of his team and makes your stay at Kathmandu easier if you need anything. We trekked to EBC and the guide and porters were amazing. We had yaks with us, and we all enjoyed the fact that they carried our luggage instead of porters. The trek is lots of fun and they always respect your pace. Unfortunatelly I contracted a kidney infection 2 days prior to arrival to base camp and required helicopter evacuation. The company ensured everything went as smoothly as possible for me, from evacuation to my stay at hospital and after hospital discharge. They were always caring. My husband also required evacuation 300m from EBC due to AMS and again their support and logistics were amazing. I would reccomend this company."

My 14 day Everest base camp trek was the best thing I've ever done. What made it so special was the incredible group I was in. My guide Nharaym was the best and looked after us so well. No one in our group got sick or altitude sickness because of it. Our 3 porters were amazing and so happy. Everyone we have encountered within the agency are so friendly, helpful and beautiful souls. All the tea houses and lodges we stayed in were excellent choices. Clean, comfortable and value for money. They all had delicious food too. No one in our group got any food related sickness either. After our trek they helped organise all our other travel, accomadation, transfers, activities and flights. I can't recommend this company enough. Thanks for a life changing expirience."

Yes, the 2nd and 3rd day was hard, but for all the hard the work you put in those climbs, you get spectacular views in return. Everything went smoothly all because of the perfect planning of our guide Shankar. He also carries a lot of knowledge about the area and the people and makes the journey both fun and interesting. I can guarantee you the food and the accommodation is a lot better than you expect at least that was the case for us, but bare in mind that there might not always be hot water left. (I see people complaining that there's no hot shower in the mountains leaving lower grades in their reviews, you should know that this has nothing to do with the people in this company but the lodges in the mountains themselves, there is a limit on electricity and hot water there and that's it. We did experience a power-cut once or twice and it only lasted for around 20 seconds.) I also got an allergic reaction while I was up there leaving me covered in hives which later led to a swollen face, arms and feet that became a bit painful. This only occurred after dinner time and did not have any affect on the trekking other than some itching for a couple of hours a day. This is nothing to worry about though, everyone can react to something new in the mountains, sometimes heat, cold, food or new medicine. I say this so you remember to bring some antihistamines. I already brought zyrtec, and it does help a little bit, but try bringing something stronger aswell just in case. For me this was a problem, only because I couldn't find out the cause of reaction. But it never came back after we were back down in the city. The trek itself is in the middle of those 11days and lasts for 5 days. The rest of the days are spent in beautiful Pokhara and Kathmandu, where you get a guided tour of the cities getting to visit beautiful temples, pagodas and waterfalls and learning about the culture of nepalese people and religion. I have to say, Nepalese people are some of the kindest and most helpful people I have encountered, very similar to Thai people. Our stay here has been absolutely amazing and our plan about only visiting Nepal once has changed, we are definitely coming back and a lot of that is thanks to Ram and Shankar and the rest of the people we've been in contact with from Himalayan Social Journey. THANK YOU \u2764\ufe0f"

Climbing to Gorepani/Poon Hill was definitely a lot more challenging than I thought it was going to be. It was also fascinating to be able to see Kathmandu with the city guide as well, even though the places they took us were 'popular', we had intimate explanations of each site and how things came to be. Very insightful. Our mountain guide Shankar was very knowledgable as we constantly asked him questions about the trek and the surrounding areas. It was great to have a local that has been on the trek numerous times taking care of us and essentially became our friend throughout the whole trip. He made sure food was ordered beforehand, so that we could squeeze ahead of larger groups and also entertained us with his magic card skills. There were times when I wanted to rest a little longer than usual but he always tried his best to keep us on track and on time. And I'm glad he did, so that I pushed myself a little further every time. The Poon Hill trek is perfect for first timers as well as seasoned trekkers as it is challenging enough and also provides such insane views. A lot of uphill steps are invoked and I powered through and am really satisfied in the end. My gf and I will certainly be returning and will be using Himalayan Social Journey again for our Everest Base Camp trek!"

They could not have done more for us and were professional, helpful, cheerful, fun, informative, encouraging.........fantastic. We did the 14 day trip including the Annapurna/Poon Hill trek, white water rafting and Chitwan visit. But it was the trek that made it really special - even on the tougher days. It's not a walk in the park but provided you have a reasonable level of fitness you will have no problems - you just need to be able to walk all day. And it is worth it for the views and experience. Most of the tea houses were good if basic - don't go with high expectations: it is a poor country and facilities are basic. The only slight disappointment was the accommodation at Ghorepani - the rooms were damp and cold and not of the same standard as the other tea houses. But that was a minor inconvenience. Hotels in Kathmandu and Pokhara are also fine - again don't expect western standards but they will be clean and comfortable. After all, you only sleep there. I would love to go back and do a different trek - but only if we had the same guides etc."

Our guide Shailesh, Sherpa Milan and porters were all nice and very helpful, while giving each individual the opportunity to walk at their own pace. It made this trip a wonderful experience.

I brought my 12yo son along to Nepal for the 11 day trek to Poon Hill and we added an extra 4 day trip to Chitwan National Park. I chose this relatively easy trek for my son but it turned out he was in better shape than me (as he had just finished yet another season of weekly football games) and coped fine with all the walking.First, the company's administration and logistics were well organised and efficient. I booked months ahead and had questions of logistics over time but Sharmila always returned emails promptly with clear answers to any queries. I arrived confident that I would be looked after and I was. The 11 day Poon Hill trek started with a tour of World Heritage sites in Kathmandu, which were all amazing places to visit as well as a rafting trip on the Trisuli River. Our special guide was very informative although a bit hard to hear and understand sometimes; still, his forays into philosophical principles and the myriad gods of hinduism were enlightening. The rafting trip was great fun yet very safe because the Trisuli is a big river with great scenery and big rapids but very few rocks or hard bits.The trek to Poon Hill was hard work as we had a steep trail to climb on the second day to get to Ghorepani, which of course wasn't the company's fault, but they did rate the walk as easy to moderate, which it is by Himalayan standards, but probably moderate to hard by Australian standards. I would suggest they make it clearer that trekking in the Himalayas is always hard work as they are extreme mountains and that any guests should keep this mind.Our guide, Binnod, was a great leader, always informing us of the upcoming activities and constantly doing his best to address any concerns. He and the porters were always fun to hang out with as well; it was a real social journey!Once our trek ended we moved on to Chitwan National Park. Due to some paperwork errors by HSJ management we didn't have seats on the bus from Kathmandu but they recovered from the mistake very well, got us into another group in a private van and even compensated with another raft trip. They took us to Hotel Hermitage in Sauraha, which was a charming if slightly rundown hotal right on the river across from the national park. Our wildlife guide from the Hotel was Madan Chaudry, who was fantastic as he knew the park very well as well as every bird call; we saw lots of interesting wildlife but seeing rhinos was eluding us until the last day and Madan was finally able to find a mother and calf for us to see which was quite thrilling.We spent over two weeks in Nepal, mostly looked after by HSJ, and they made our trip easy and fun. I would happily go with them again in the future."

I had a fantastic time on this trip, it was amazingly diverse from hot n dusty Kathmandu to the jungle in chitwan to beautiful Pokhara to the amazing & magestic Himalayas everything was perfect, even the storm we walked through didn't phase our enthusiasm for the trail and the fantastic guides & porters looking after us. Our guides Binod & Milan did a great job, they kept the group humming along, always checking how each of us was going, nothing was too much trouble, they made our trip so enjoyable no matter how tough the environment got. The porters were fantastic carrying huge loads everyday, my thanks to Kalyan, Subus A, Subus B, Ganesh, Akal & Krishna for all your efforts everyday, finding the things we'd lost before we even knew we'd lost them and sticking with us on the trail so no one walked alone when the group got strung out. A highlight of the trip that's not advertised is the singing and dancing put on by the guides & porters In the evenings, the fun and happiness was infectious not to mention great for the soul. I'd highly recommend this trip to anyone, young or old, it provides a great cross Section of what Nepal has to offer, I LOVED every minute of this trip!!! I'd highly recommend Himalayan Social Journey to anyone contemplating a trip to Nepal, I also did an Everest flight & a sightseeing day trip with this company and could not fault any of Their staff, they all do a great job and provide a great personal experience."

From our initial email contacts, booking our pre tour accommodation, to dropping us off at the airport, HSJ looked after us. As first time trekkers, we were a little apprehensive about this part of our trip, however, it was the highlight. Not only because of the stunning scenery, but because of our guides and porters. Binod (Mr a little bit up a little bit down) and Milan (Mr calculator) looked after their \"family\" every step of the way and were fantastic in insuring that we had everything we needed. And as for our 6 porters, their ever smiling faces and encouragement never ceased to amaze us. How they all found the energy is sing, dance and entertain us at the end of the day is beyond me. They are all a credit to themselves and to HSJ. Accommodation and food on the trek is basic but good and the accommodation in Pokhara and Chitwan exceeded our expectations. The only negative for me was the visit to the elephant park. Seeing these beautiful animals on short chains was distressing. Several people in our group chose not to go elephant riding and of those that did, many said they would not do it again. Whilst the conditions that they are kept in is not HSJ's fault, it may be worthwhile considering that many people out there do not enjoy or want to support this kind of tourism and provide other options. Would we visit Nepal again, absolutely and would we choose HSJ, definitely. Well done Ram, you have an excellent group of dedicated people."

What really made our trip a pleasure was our guide Ganga who was knowledgeable, friendly, happy and helpful person. Santa and Rupess were our porters and also had ready smiles and were friendly. Food was fantastic, accommodation good with fantastic views, but don't expect hot water whilst trekking at every stop. Also on our 6 day trek there are many, many steps so be prepared with fitness and knee straps. I would not hesitate to recommend HSJ to my family and friends if they wished to travel to Nepal in the future, they made sure we were looked after each step of the way in the 14 days we were over there."

A friend and I did a 7 day trek in the Langtang region in October 2014 - our second time with Himalayan Social Journey and they impressed us again!The trek itself was absolutely spectacular - all the way from Syraphru Besi to Kyanjin Gompa. Both the accommodation at the tea houses (or lodges) and the food were good. I recommend basing yourself for a couple of days at Kyanjin Gompa as you can then explore the beautiful village - make sure you check out Dorje Cafe (the cake is scumptuous!). This will also give you time to climb Kyanjin Ri and Tsergo Ri and/or do a day trek further along the Langtang valley.Putting aside the stunning scenery, the trip was made all the more memorable by the exceptional service provided by our Guide (Binod Gharti) and porter (Kumar). They were so well organised, highly attentive - and had a great sense of humour. They really went above and beyond (playing cards with us - and preparing a delicious plate of fuit each night as a treat) - we would consider them both friends. Ram and the team at HSJ - including our friend and ever-smiling driver, Dilip - really know what they are doing...if I make it back to this special place again I will certainly use their services a third time."

            "review": "Second time 'round even better!. Lets start by being up front ...these days whenever you engage with a tour operator ( restaurant, guide etc etc) the final thing they do is ask you to recommend them on Trip Adviser - which of course is exactly what Ram at Himalayan Social Journey did. The fact that it was our second time arranging our trip through them should have made it clear that he didnt need to worry .....if it hadn't been great the first time we'd have voted with our wallets and simply booked elsewhere. On our first trip to Nepal in 2013 we joined a HSJ group tour for the Gorapani Trek ...which was amazing . This time around though we didn't want to join a group or do a 'set tour' - wanting to visit India before moving on to Nepal and an extended trek to Kayjin Gompa . Ram coordinated with another operator -Abid- in India to arrange our trip exactly as we wanted it -including last minute alterations made necessary by Malaysian Airlines .Really - you could arrange a trek yourself but its very reassuring (and relaxing ...its meant to be a holiday -right?) to know that someone ( probably the ever helpful & smiling Dilip) will be at the airport to pick you up and get you back to catch your flight after the adventure is over ...and that everything in between including meals, accommodation, entertainment ( the guides and porters can all sing and dance AS WELL AS carry a load that would squash another mere mortal!) and thoughtful and informed guidance about the trek, country and people along the way is all arranged. Having someone else arrange the details of your trek could make you feel like you've lost control over your trek/adventure experience but its not like that - more like Nepalese friends hosting you on a fantastic tour of their amazing country and culture ...trust, relax and enjoy :)"

Our guides, Binod and Sanka and all of the porters were so kind, patient and generous with their time, humour and encouragement. The scenery - majestic mountain vistas and peaceful, cool rainforest were made all the more enjoyable by the lack of rain! We were so lucky. It did not rain once whilst we were trekking but overnight whilst we slept - perfect!Watching the sunrise over the mountains from Poon Hill is definitely a highlight of the trip and no matter how sore your legs are from dragging your bones up thousands of steps the day before, get up at 4.30am and climb those stairs! Just remember to take it slow - bistaari, bistaari and enjoy!"

We were so exciting all the way and had dancing parties after dinner in the last two nights of the trek.

We had a small group, which was really nice, and our guide (Binod) and porters (Pokas and Santos) were absolutely fantastic. The company were really flexible and accomodating as well, even agreeing to let us stay in Ghorepani an extra night (much appreciated!). Binod and the guys did so much more than just guiding/portering - they helped out the staff at the guest houses with our meals and ordering, and sometimes even cooking! The Annapurna trek was beautiful, all our accomodation for the trek was in guest houses that were basic but lovely and clean with fantastic views (once the clouds cleared!). The accomodation in the other places - Chitwan, Pokhara, Kathmandu - was great, no complaints there. It would have been nice to spend another day in Chitwan as there was so much to do, and it's such a lovely little town, but it was great to have an afternoon free to wander, drink and shop. The jungle walk and canoeing in Chitwan were great (if a little scary!). I personally found the conditions the elephants are kept in at the Army/breeding centre rather sad (most the elephants there were hobbled) and some of the elephant safari mahouts seemed to treat their elephants rather badly, but this isn't a reflection on Himalayan Social Journey at all. All in all, a really positive trip with a great bunch of people. I have every intention of coming back to Nepal (dhal bat power, 24hr!) and couldn't reccomend Himalayan Social Journey highly enough :)"

To all those in the Himalayan Social Journey HSJ a big thank you for making this one of the most memorable trips I have ever had. This was one of the best things I have done, It was physically and mentally challenging but the scenery and culture were amazing which made it all worth it. Like others I would go back again no problems. Note from my journal, an experience of a lifetime that will never be forgotten from singing bowls in Kathmandu to mountain peaks rising through the clouds, exposed to the extremes of nature that have ever changing views that will amaze you. Love this from on a tea shirt at one of the lodges \" the beauty brings tears to my eyes and then freezes them to my cheeks.. Don't forget to bring a flag or some memorabilia to leave at the lodge to commemorate your trek. Read the HSJ web page for hints on what to bring and don't be afraid to get a warm jacket in Kathmandu especially us warmer climes people as it's a lot cheaper than at home or on line.

We had quite varying degrees of fitness levels in our group, so our guides and porters were fantastic ensuring that we were all looked after, especially those that really struggled with the heat and the thousands of steps we had to climb. The itinerary was interesting and varied (white water rafting, elephant riding, canoeing, cultural shows) with lots of chances to see the real Nepal and meet the beautiful people. The accommodation varied from the very basic guesthouses to 5 star luxury in Chitwan National Park, and the food overall was really good. Morning sunrise on the top of Poon Hill is an absolute must. Quite simply amazing.The only thing I would have liked more of was the Yoga and Meditation. 2 classes was just not enough with all that trekking!Thank you to Ram, Rameswhar, Shankar, Prakash, Binod, Subas, Bikash and Amreet for making my trip to Nepal so special.

Accommodation is cosy, WIFI is readily available at every provided lodging although with limited speed. Staffs are helpful and friendly. And we forged new friendships there. Especially with Amreet and Ganga. Amreet even took a bicycle ride with us in Pokhara, and paraglided with us in Sarangkhot. And of course we have stayed in touch through social media. Ganga is awesome at his work. He motivates us all the way throughout all the strenuous activities, making sure we are well cared for. My gratitude for the wonderful staffs who made our journey so much more memorable."

The guide and porters werepolite, helpful and friendly.What needs more attention are facilities in the \"guest houses\" and a couple of the \"hotels\". Sometimes no toilet paper, soap; clean (lockable) toilets, some emergency lighting - when there was a power cut. Simple and inexpensive remedies that would make the trip more enjoyable.The Chitwan hotel was excellent, river rafting (and swimming in the river) fantastic and the elephant safari and getting showered by an elephant was a great experience. We enjoyed the walk and the company and can recommend the Himalayan Social Journey. But, be prepared for Nepal - Hygiene and traffic congestion!"

Hence, my expectations with Himalayan Social Journey were not set on lofty grounds. However, I could not be more wrong, and I strongly believe I am saying this for the 10 other travellers whom I've trekked with for 2 weeks.Every aspect of the tour was taken care of. There was no need for us to worry about anything. From airport transfers to trekking equipment to hotel accommodation, Himalayan Social Journey was meticulous in their dealings. During the trek, our guides were fantastic. Binod, Tenzen, and Sherpa (the awesome dude commanding the yaks) were so amiable and friendly that they have no qualms about treating complete strangers as family. Their knowledge and experience in the mountains were also utterly impressive.Ram, the boss of the company, was the most jovial man in Kathmandu. His warm, passionate attitude might surprise you at first, but within minutes, you would feel his sincerity. What happened to me during the trip was that I had to be hell-evacuated from Periche due to an unfortunate eye infection. Ram took it upon himself to handle all the financial and logistical matters. I have never been able to get around the fact that an almost complete stranger was willing to fork out thousands of dollars as a guarantee. His care for his customers really bewilders me.Himalayan Social Journey takes care of your every need and concern. I have never been so pleased with a tour agency. They truly deserve the 5 stars and please do sign up tour packages with them - you won't regret it."

The staff including little Ram (leader), Shubus, Purnah (porters) were incredibly attentive and made the trip an absolute pleasure.

Suggest if you decide to go buy your trekking gear including clothing when you get to Kathmandu. More expensive in Pokohara. Kathmandu is set up for trekking you will pay about a 1/5 of the cost as in Australia. You need a down jacket for poon hill but you can hire that if required from Pokohara very cheap.  The guides and porters are just amazing, helpful lots of happiness, laughter , singing and dancing. We were in a group of 20 picked up from the airport and returned to the airport at the end of trip.

We were met at the airport as arranged by out guide Binod which was a relief given the chaos of Kathmandu airport. We were pleasently suprised by the initial hotel accomodation and the enthusiasm and friendliness of Ram and Binod.Throughout the duration of the trek Binod and the other two guides looked after us very well and again we were suprised by the accomodation we stayed in each night, (we were expecting a lot less from the research we had done into other peoples experiences with different companies). The group we were with was great,all Australians and ranging in age, experience and fitness, everyone got along well and looked after each other both during the trekking days and in the evening, (some people struggled with fitness and others with health issues due to the altitude). I must commend Binod and the other guides including our yak driver who completed a stretcher rescue of one of our group from Base Camp back to Gorek Shep, a really amazing feat.There are a couple of issues I want to raise which were a concern and could be done better, we were guaranteed a group of maximum 10 people, we ended up with sixteen, this caused some initial issues with equipment but which were sorted out at the 11th hour, however we do feel that the increased numbers left out guides over stretched. Due to the different fitness levels we found the group got too spread out with the front people out of sight with the lead guide and the slow people way back with another guide, this left the bulk of the group (in the middle) wandering the Himilayan range on their own, (the third guide was usually back with the yaks) admitedly its hard to get lost but a couple of times it did happen to people, and in the case of someone having an accident it is a safety issue. So Ram, if you want bigger groups this needs to be addressed. We also met up with people once the trek was over and we were back in Kathmandu who had also just finished the trek with HSJ there group was also supposed to be 10 and was infact 17! We also discovered that the porters were going through personal baggage and moving things from bag to bag, apparantly in order to balance the Yaks? this left one person without their sleeping bag for a night before it was located the next day. This is a NO NO as far as we were concerned. As I said earlier we had a really great experience with HSJ and think we got great value for money, I hope the issues raised will be taken on board for the benefit of other trekers. For first timers, you need a good level of fitness to really get the most enjoyment out of this trek. A couple of months spent in the gym would be a huge advantage."

He has made the journey to Pokhara and Sarangkot very enjoyable & comfortable despite the road condition & long drive. Raju with his lovely voice & nice laugh is a very experienced trekking guide. Couldn't have done the trek without his motivation. Sometimes trekking, sometimes rafting...While the country is still developing in many ways, I find it safe and convenient. Indeed the team has made the trip very pleasant & smooth. There was no hiccup at all!Whenever I think of Nepal, I will remember friends with easygoing personality, kinship, positive attitude, gratitude & zest towards life. Something to learn from them.

            "review": "Everest Base Camp Trek ticked off the list. I travelled to Kathmandu with my daughter mid March for a trek to Everest Base Camp with Himalayan Social Journey. All my emails leading up to booking with them and then the many sent after booking were always responded to speedily by Ram. And I had countless questions. Nothing was a problem and his service amazing. He even made the point of coming to welcome us and then once again when we left giving us his blessing.The trek itself we were blessed to have the best guide and Sherpas we could have wanted.I was the slowest in the group and our amazing guide Binod was always there with an encouraging word and stayed with us along the way without being intrusive. He would make sure we were safe and as we were always the last ones to arrive at the guest houses at the end of the day he would get there last with us.We had 4 hardworking wonderful Sherpas, Geljen, Asish,Sunman and Raj. As we would complain about how difficult the hills and walk was (well me anyway) those boys were carrying25 kgs on their backs and bounding up the hills always beating the group to the next stop.A special mention has to go out to one of our Sherpas Gelgen. He was truly my angel over there helping me with anything and everything. His kindness was truly appreciated and will never be forgotten.I truly miss those boys.The trip is full of many different experiences from the chaos of Kathmandu to visiting all the sights there. Through to the amazing scenery in the Himalayas and of course the satisfaction of making it to Everest Base Camp.I cannot gloss over the fact that it is exhaustingly difficult, or unbelievably cold in the eveningsbut if a 50 year woman can do it than so can you. It is without a doubt the trip of a lifetime just make sure before you attempt it you really must have done adequate training before you go.Also remember you are in Nepal and things are not like they are at home. Power cut outs what seems to be every hour or so and bathrooms not like you have probably seen before and in the mountains not many with running water. Just bring your wet wipes, grab a shower when you canand at the end of the trek at the lodge back in Lukla the best shower you have ever had in your life will be waiting for you.Thank you for having us in your wonderful country."

The physical, mental and emaotional challenges you will should not be under-estimated...having said that I believe it was one of the best things I've ever accomplished.The scenery is spectacular and words and photos cannot convey what you will feel when you are standing next to a mountain that is 3 klms higher than where you are standing (and struggling to get a lung full of oxygen).Binot & Visnu (guides) were professional,insightful and a lot of fun. Thanks to them I felt I was able to keep within my own physical limits each day and reach base camp. Always helpful and considerate, nobody ever felt rushed or pressured to go at a pace that was beyond them. Kancha (chief porter/sherpa) was a classic. Always happy, you won't believe the k's this guy racks up (kilo's and klms). Ram and Shamilla keep the business side running smoothly and all the logistics fell into place effortlessly. All in all HSJ are a professional outfit and you won't be disappopinted in the trek.Give it a go, you won't regret it. You will make friends for life on this trek."

What made it a life time experience was our guide Ram Chandra, his assistant guide, Milan who was our porter and the other three porters for our group of 8 - Amrit (the cheeky one), the quite one and the older one. Ram Chandra led the team in ensuring everyone was catered for, running through each day how everyone felt and briefing the group on what to expect the next day. He provided necessary information with good humour, kindness and understanding. The group, guide and porters blended in well and made it so much fun along the way as we climbed up and down step after step after step. Nothing was a problem for the gentle 'No Probs' man (Prabin). The trek was amazing with beautiful and changing scenery every day. From very hot weather, heavy rain, hail, snow and freezing temperature, we seemed to get it all and added to the fantastic experience. The food was an experience on its own as we were guided by Ram Chandra as to what was safe for us to eat and drink at each stop. Our porters led by our assistant guide Milan were always there when you needed them, attentive and offering assistance and could not do enough for us. We also visited Chitwan National Park which was great. I would recommend staying there for at least 3 nights so to have the opportunity for either a full day or half day jeep safari. We missed the farewell dinner in Kathmandu with our group and was escorted to one for just us by our porter Milan for a final memorable Nepali experience of great food and culture on our last night in Kathmandu. Our whole holiday in Nepal was organised through HSJ. All in all, Ram (owner) has a great team of people working for him from the ones that pick you up from the airport and happy to take you wherever you need to go, the guides, porters and everyone you come into contact with. We had minor glitches with accommodation changes, but enjoyed our time in Nepal so much we hope to return in the next couple of years for a higher and longer trek. Thanks to everyone at Himalayan Social Journey!"

            "review": "Amazing Nepalese Experience. I travelled to Nepal in November 2013 with a friend. We had organised the Everest base camp trek with HSJ, who had been very helpful throughout the process. We arrived in Nepal and stepped out of the crazy airport with little clue as to what was going on, navigated our way through the crowds and out into the pick up area. We were ushered to a car by someone carrying the sign so we followed and took the bumpy ride into Nepal whilst our chaperone Binod pointed out the sights. We finally arrived at the office and we met with Ram (managing director) who greeted us with generous Nepalese hospitality and helped us go through our itinerary. Everything was organised and despite having to change things around due to the election unrest at the time we were on our way for our stay at the Chitiwan National Park, where we rode elephants, canoed crocodile infested waters, trekked through jungle in search of elusive rhinos amongst a myriad of other fun activities whilst staying at a river side resort.After returning from this adventure we met up with the trekking group back in Nepal where and flew out to Lukla for the beginning of the trek. The trek up to Everest basecamp is a 7ish day affair which takes you through breathtaking scenery on a journey which is sometimes challenging, with dusty narrow trails, yak trains to dodge, swinging suspension bridges, ankle twisting stones, freezing showers (if any at all) and if you are unlucky altitude sickness. Don't let these challenges deter you however, our guides binod and bisnu were a wealth of knowledge and were more friends than just guides. We were fortunate to travel with a great bunch of people and experience some of the most amazing scenery in the world. I had the misfortune of being affected heavily by altitude sickness and flew down from Everest base camp by helicopter (which was stunning as well)Finally on the last day I had a personal driver to take me around the city to see all the sights. He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and I had a great day.One thing I must say is that the staff at HSJ especially Ram and Binod, were extremely accommodating and nothing was too hard. The level of service was unparalleled to anything I had experienced before. There was always someone ready to meet us from the bus, ferry us between locations, made changing flights extremely easy, put up with the insurance and medical processes just to name a few. I feel that this service is a reflection of the hard working nature of Ram and his team who strive to make your experience the best possible.One thing that should be noted is that for fussy people, accommodation isn't 5 star, you will be hassled on the street constantly to buy drugs, give food, money, buy stuff, the air is dusty and smoky. On the trek the going can be tough at points even if you are of reasonable fitness, and the accommodation and creature comforts become more Spartan the higher you are. However the people that make this trek possible, the friends you make along the way, the food, the culture, the amazing temples, the breathtaking scenery, the challenge; these overshadow any of the negatives, and if you go in prepared for the journey you will be guaranteed to have an amazing experience which you will never forget and talk about for years to come.Thanks again to Ram and Binod from HSJ and the guides Bisnu and Binod"

Be prepared to rough it out a bit. Weather can get bad, and you might have to wait it out (could be a few days) or opt for a chopper ride at additional cost if you're pressed for time. Expect rooms to be colder as you ascend. You will rewarded with fantastic views - plural - and an experience you won't forget ! Cultural dinner and dance on the last night is a slightly posh affair to reward your hard work. Ram's warm and affable personality was representative of the Nepali culture and community, and places HSJ as an approachable and accommodating group for me to join again for any future trips to the Himalayas for sure."

They ensured our group are well looked after round the clock. Bishnu is very informative and friendly. Milan also has the potential to be a good guide in the future. I would recommend them for anyone interested to go to Nepal. I will request for them next time I'm going there.Keep up the good work, guys!"

Ram and his team were great. The highlights were the Everest flight, elephant riding, sitting on the back of an elephant in the river getting wet (elephant bathing), rafting, climbing to the top of Poon Hill to see the sun rise over the Himalayas, and paragliding with the back drop of the snow capped Himalayas.Some tips:1. Be vaccinated against everything - many vaccinations cover for other things (cholera covers for many of the organisms associated with traveller's diarrhoea)2. Carry a small packet of tissues everywhere3. When you go rafting you will get wet, actually saturated - be prepared and dress accordingly.4. The lodges while trekking are good - no need to take a sleeping bag. You get a bed with a fresh sheet and a duvet/doona. It is fine. Take earplugs as the walls are paper thin and there is nothing like exhaustion to make people snore.5. Pay extra to catch the plane from Pokhara back to Kathmandu, as it is worth it. When you travel in the bus from Kathmandu to go rafting you will know why."

All of my emails prior to the trip were answered promptly, professionally and friendly. Ram was there to meet me at the beginning and see me off at the end. His guide Prabyn was more than amazing, not to mention so much fun, for the whole trip and was always in touch with the \"office\" Prab helped us to purchase all our extra trekking gear in Pokhara and accommodated all of our typical female change of plans with a laugh! There was a little bit of political tension and disruptions but not once did i feel unsafe! Prab looked after us! Our porters were just as amazing and lovely. Special thanks to Noble, Krishna and Bob! The trip was a trip of a life time and i am hoping to go back next year and if i do I will seek Ram's services (HSJTK) There is nothing to fault with this trip, the group matching was great, accommodation fantastic, fun value- superb, trek length- just enough and yes the view at the end of each day of trekking.... Priceless... must does: climb 3500 + steps to Poon Hill, white water rafting, Elephant safari, canoeing with crocodiles, paragliding in Pokhara, oh and a bottle of red wine each night to keep you warm!

We embarked on a trip of a lifetime, commencing with a perfect flight over Mt Everest on my 65th birthday. Despite pre-election tensions and strikes we felt completely safe under Ram's care and he kept in daily contact to ensure our holiday fulfilled every expectation (and more). Our hotels were excellent and we had no additional costs as tips were included in the daily rate. Ram answers emails and mobile messages immediately and is able to be flexible when required. Despite a bad knee and inability to trek, we were taken to the highest points to enjoy the sunrise and sunsets over the magnifcient mountain ranges. Special gratitude to our city guide, Basu, our mountain guide Bishnu, and our jungle guide in Chitwan, Prem. Our good drivers Jeevan and Dilip kept us safe on the roads in the city and mountain areas. We had the best holiday possible and thank you to each one of you for making it so memorable. We are also pleased HSJ contributes a percentage of their income to supporting education of Nepalese children. We would definitely book another holiday with Himalayan Social Journey and have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone visiting Nepal."

Highly recommended.Ram, the owner, was very welcoming and personal in his dealings with us all, we felt very informed across the entire time and no request was a problem for him. Very friendly and professional. The accommodation in Kathmandu I felt was quite good given the other options around us. In Pokhara it was excellent. A big difference we saw was that we seemed to get the pick of the guesthouse rooms well in advance. We never had to worry about missing out and also got the good info from Saran each day on which showers were always hot or which facilities were a bit nicer etc-very welcome info after a hard day walking. We also stayed at some places along the way which were a little different to the usual stops. Places where the food or accom was a little better etc..This was a great move I thought, sometimes we had walked an extra 15 minutes and had landed at a better destination than most did. These guys really know where the better places are and this is where it comes in handy each day. The trek itself was only a little more strenuous than I thought, but most certainly achievable. The first few days will be a little tough on the body but its amazing how fast your body responds. Overall this is still a trek that most people could do. Be prepared for what seems like an infinity of stone steps up huge mountains and then down again as this is the majority of the walking, especially before you get right up in the higher altitudes. Altitude symptoms for most people are a dull headache for an afternoon and a morning around ABC. The way the team planned it made a huge difference to how we managed the symptoms. It didn't really give any of us much grief though so don't be too concerned with it. They're keeping their eye on you. Only a few small things I'd recommend to improve the experience... Flying directly back from Pokhara to ktm most definitely, after a couple of days in Pokhara to regroup after the trek. Missing out on the rafting after the trekking kinda sucks (it was great) but given you have to drive for the best part of a day on one of the worst roads in the world to get from Pokhara to Kathmandu I think not doing the rafting is a good trade off. The road really is shocking. It would not make a big difference to the costings to fly back so definitely ask to do it. Any time you need a great driver to take you somewhere, Dilip is your man. Excellent SAFE driver and when you're in Nepal, this is a huge plus. The other driver who took us from Pokhara to Nayapul to start the trek was also a very skilled and experienced driver but was way too fast. And I've travelled extensively on asian roads...We had an awesome 4WD too when other groups had little minivans- another plus to HSJ. But it doesn't matter how good a driver you are if you're travelling at twice the speed limit, even on flat roads...slow down. I don't want these small things to overshadow the rest because this really is an amazing experience with an exceptional group of people running it. I will most definitely be recommending HSJ, Saran, Bhimsen and Amrit to others. And I will be back. You all made this more than a trek, especially Saran. Day after day you made sure we were looked after and we knew everything we needed to know. We all noticed and appreciated the difference you made to our time there, thank you. As for the mountains and what it feels like to be up there.....? You just have to find that out for yourself because I haven't got the words to do it justice. Just book it, you won't regret it. Troy"

From the beginning, Ram - the owner - was very attentive and timely responded to my e-mail queries.When we first arrived in Kathmandu, Ram brought us to his office and throw in ideas to customize our itineraries from the original one. We then decided with Kathmandu sight seeing, overnight in Nagarkot (first sighting of the Himalaya), Bakthapur sight seeing, rafting and overnight camping in Tirishuli river (grade 3), activities in Chitwan (jungle trekking, elephant ride, etc.), sight seeing in Pokhara (including up-close encounter to Himalaya's peaks: Annapurna, Machapuchare, Manaslu), and trekking in Sarangkot.Arrangement on accomodations throughout the tour were basic but clean with hot water available in most of the properties.Other highlight of having HImalayan Social Journey as tour arranger was having our Malay speaking local guide, Bishnu, although we told Ram earlier that we're okay with English speaking one. But we're very glad to have Bishnu throughout the trip as he was very helpful and always concern with our well-being. Our group consisted of 5 females ranging from mid 30s to 50s in age. When we were traveling in tourist bus from Kathmandu-Chitwan-Pokhara, Bishnu ensured that we're comfortable and save particularly during our ride from Tirishuli river to that was stretched to 5 hours (from normal 2.5 hours) due to pre-election strikes and disturbances that were happening across Nepal. When we did the trekking in Sarangkot, Bishnu cheerfully helped us with the steep and difficult tracks since couple of us were afraid of height and having knee condition.Overall, we had great time and definatly one of most memorable experience for my friends and I. Thank you Himalayan Social Journey for making this trip a memorable one."

From the first day to the last day they ensured all on our trip had a great time. The sights of Kathmandu, white water rafting, elephant safari (even got up close to a mother Rhino and her baby), trekking through the mountains, and more. The beauty was that our guides always had things under control and yes the accommodation un the mountains is basic but clean and comfortable and after a big day trekking any bed feels good :) I was expecting very basic food but the places we stayed at had a good range of choices. When I talked with other groups they had similar itineraries to us but what they didn't have was our guides and porters. Their infectious smiles and energy added something extra to this trip which made it feel like family. How they could still have the energy to sing and dance after a days trek will always amaze me. There are plenty of companies in Nepal that do these trips but if you want one whose crew do everything they can and end up as your friends than you need to go with Himalayan Social Journey.My boots blew out after the first day of the trek so I went to throw them out but one of the porters end up getting a needle and some heavy duty thread, end result was they made it all the way to the end of the 5 day trek. This is just one case of that little bit extra they do.Thanks Ram for putting such a good crew together and look forward to returning to NepalPete"

The program of the trip was extensive and varied. We had yoga classes, temple visits, rafting and the cream of the cake - mountain trekking. Ram, Binod, and Amrit took such great care of the group to ensure that we all are very well taken care of. Both guides and porters were such great bunch of guys that they were like a family by the end of the trip. Nepal is truly a magnificent country with majestic scenery and the Nepali make our experience even more magical. We love their ever so happy, patient and serene ways of life. Nepal is not a destination for someone who would like a pampering holiday. Hotels and accommodation is basic, electricity or wifi may be unreliable. Mountain stays are even more basic than in the city. Foods, however, was very good and safe. Mountain trekking is quite arduous but a sense of achievement is well worth the effort.I would rate the experience as 5 out of 5 if not for the mouldy bathrooms during our Kathmandu stay. However, i would strongly suggest everyone to visit the country and use Nepal Social Journey to organise the tour as I found it to be reliable and of good value."

The whole experience was great more than expected and value for money twice over ( yes im an accountant) the trek was hard but not as hard as expected altitude was not a problem with the well planned itinerary and a little help from diamox ( 125 g) at ktm Then when on trek up to 250 no problem for our group # your callaccomodation was fine, not 4 star but clean cosy and excellent sleeping bags were provided by him social and extra blankets were provided, never cold except those extra toilet runs due to bloody diamox. the trip was well planned and managed and our tour leader had the same trek to ebc over 400 times ,so knew the path blindfolded but better still knew all the hotel/ tea houses and allowed us the better rooms. FOOD OPTIONS ARE LIMITED EVERYWHERE DUE TO LOCATION BUT ON A USER PAY basis there was plenty of choices at reasonable prices, you will love the garlic soup by end the trip, goid for ams. The tour leader and porters were all great and helpful and quietly funny i miss them writing thisoverall the tour was great, a small size of 8 was awsesome and everyone interacted great, even laughed at my jokes when struggling for air whilst treking, ha ha the porters worked so hard always smiling even carring 30 kg up step hills or sliding down snow covered tracks ( we got caught in snow blizzard one in 20 year pheonemon) The farewell dinner was great, with food provided best in nepal and best of all paid by the ever thoughtful ram, the man pulling all the strings, he is very approachable considerate and well organised, helped us with tours pre and post tour at good prices. Tip allow 2 or 3 days end in case wether problems, if no issue take the cheap option to rhinos in chitwan nat park awsemome exp.As i said do it you wont regret we didnt even falling three kms/ hours dshort od ebc bloody snow never liked the stuff, not good with boubon either( dont drink whikst ascending) save for down hill ENJOY !!!!!"

My wife and I could not have expected anything better than the fantastic service provided by Ram Sapkota (Managing Director) and this great team of guides and porters. There are always problems when traveling in a 3rd world country and when there was a problem Ram would always be there to fix the problem for the group. Our group of eight had a wonderful experience interacting with our guides and porters throughout the hike and at night we played cards and even exchanged card tricks.We would highly recommend the Himalayan Social Journey to anyone."

Ram was very attentative, quick to answer emails and ready to greet us on arrival. Saron, our amazing guide was assisted by Sherpas Raju and Ambritt. Saron was clearly a very experienced guide, providing outstanding service, above and beyond. We had plenty of time during the trek to catch up with other Trekkers, who did not have the same experience as we did. All accmodation was clean, our food was cooked to order. Saron checked all the food was exactly as ordered and up to standard, he and his team waited on us hand and foot as such. After long days trekking the ensured we had all we needed, ready for the next day, with a smile and a genuine enthusiasm. The trekk is challenging in parts, lots of step, thousands in one day. So be prepared for this, but guides like Saron make it easier. I would trek Nepal again using this company, without doubt, we truely felt that we had received first class service."

            "review": "12 Day Annapurna Treking / Yoga Holiday. I will be eternally grateful that I answered a Facebook advert by Yoga teacher Alexandra Bruin to join her Yoga trekking holiday. Alexandra had joined with Ram Sapkota\u2019s Himalayan Social to organise a 12-day holiday that inspired, thrilled, moved and exhausted me.Ram is old school and by that I mean his word is his bond \u2013 if you are lucky enough to meet the man \u2013 who donates 10% of his profits to community projects \u2013 you will understand. Meeting him was not a problem either because he made sure he was there to see us off on the first morning of the holiday and there to take us for a cultural meal on the last night before personally seeing me to my ride to the airport for my return home.The Himalayan Social guide looking after us was Bishnu and the porter was Binod. Over the next 12 days I quickly came to realise that we had been blessed because they were without a shadow of a doubt the best most personable friendly knowledgeable team out of those that we met on the trek looking after other groups. Not only that but when the guides got together to provide some Nepalese folk singing and dancing it was clear that Bishnu was the best dancer on the mountain.I have had a regular yoga practice for 2-3 years now at a yoga centre where teachers come and go but only the best survive. Alexandra would have no trouble making herself a permanent fixture at any yoga centre that was lucky enough to benefit from her patronage.Her Yoga instruction is excellent, so much so that she had the Bishnu & Binon accomplishing poses it took me a year to master (and I\u2019m using the word master loosely).This was her second year doing the trekking / yoga tour and it was obvious that she was there because she has fallen in love with the country and the people and has taken Ram\u2019s charitable causes to her heart.I have said a lot about the people because by the end of the holiday I felt I we had all bonded as friends and I know if Alexandra does the tour next year she will insist on having Bishnu & Binon on her team.I would have been happy with the friendship and the spectacular scenery alone but am happy to confirm that the town hotels and the tea houses selected by Himalayan Social were to a very good standard often providing a standard of service / accommodation & facilities that exceeded my expectations. Throw in the city guided tours and you have what is a fantastic holiday at unbelievable value for money.So if you are thinking of booking a holiday through Himalayan Social or through Alexandra \u2013 do not worry, you will be in excellent hands."

During this tour we also had a number of opportunities to see the whole or parts of the Himalayan ranges - the best viewing point was Chisapani from where we had a view of all of the Himalayas (and what a breathtaking sight it was).Whilst I went during the monsoon season, I was not hampered by it in the slightest. In fact, there was plenty of sunshine and, if there was any rain, it occured either towards the end of the day or at night.I would highly recommend HSJ to assist with any tours in the region as they are helpful and professional from the get go with all questions answered prior to and during the tour.

We were met at the airport by Binod Dhakal, who was our guide for the entire trip, and escorted back to our hotel in Thamel, Kathmandu. After a day of escorted sightseeing around Kathmandu, we were taken by bus for some rafting, and then on to Chitwan National Park. Here we were taken elephant riding (we saw a rhino!), got to bathe an elephant, and also see the elephant breeding centre. After Chitwan we headed up to Pokhara for the trekking, where we were to do the Poon Hill circuit. This again was excellent, porters had been hired so we only needed to carry small day rucksacks. The scenery was incredible, and we were as usual very well looked after by Binod and the team of porters, who were all very friendly. Accommodation was in the trekking lodges, which were basic, but clean and comfy.Binod was excellent throughout the trip. He was always available to deal with any queries, and did his best to sort out any problems that occurred. From taking us shopping on our first day in Kathmandu to make sure we had the right trekking gear, to waiting behind and looking after the slowest member of our party when trekking, or making sure we each had a bag of salt to ward off leeches, the level of care he provided was fantastic. He is clearly a very experienced guide, and knew all the tricks like placing your breakfast order at the trekking lodges the night before, so you don't have to wait for breakfast. He always made sure we knew what was happening, and was very patient when dealing with everyone in our trekking group.Ram, the owner of HSJ, is also able to organise additional activities such as para-gliding or an Everest flight. We did the para-gliding in Pokhara, which was brilliant, a really nice way to see the lake. The only complaint we could make about HSJ would be regarding the booking of the para-gliding, where it became clear that Ram was charging us significantly more for the activity than if we booked directly through the para-gliding company, which we eventually did. Would advise anyone planning to do any of the additional activities to check the prices first, do avoid any misunderstandings."

Although I did find it hard to get responses to my emails prior to the trip regarding transportation, weather, supplies, if there are others in the group...I would say if those things are important to you that you remain persistent because these are things that could make or break your trip. I did meet a fellow that ended up having to do the trek with just a porter when he arrived after thinking he signed up to be with a group. There was also a small hiccup when I arrived and no one was there to pick me up from the airport. I had never gotten a response from my emails as to what hotel I'd be staying at so I had no idea where to even take a taxi to...so that was a tad stressful. But the porters and guides are insanely polite and charismatic and completely made up for any or all discrepancies. I loved all the time we were able to spend with them. They made sure to show everyone a good time and are just completely genuine people. I would highly recommend hiring a guide and porter if you are considering a trek, especially through this agency.

Right from the start the staff of Ram, the owner, was very helpful in every way regarding my initial concerns and always reply to emails promptly.Upon arrival Kathmandu airport, we were met by Bishnu who was our guide throughout the trek and his 2 wonderful porters Milan and Ombrith always smiling and courteous with a heavy load on their backs seemingly floating up the mountains without a care in the world, so awesome they were indeed with Bishnu always making sure we are safe and well fed. I would highly recommend them to tailor make your trek in Nepal and I am confident you will not be disappointed, they really go out of their way extending their warm Nepali hospitality. This was an experience of a lifetime and I have them to thank for making it so unforgettable for me and my kids."

Not only does this company offer great value and an outstanding experience, you also know a part of what you spend goes to help some of Nepal's children attend school and get an education that may otherwise be impossible.The owner, Ram, was initmately involed with our trip from planning and booking extra nights through to meeting up with us mulitple times while we were in Nepal to make sure our every need was met. His entire team is fantastic and our guide and porters did an amazing job. They not only guided us through the trek part of the trip and carried all out gear up 3200m and back but did so with a great attitude and at times were singing and playing the flute while carrying 30kg up the many steps and steep paths. Nepal is an amazing place to visit and if you go you must book with Himalayan Social Journey. Ram has lived in the US and very much understands the needs of Western travellers plus he is leading an Education program in a Nepal village. Ram's trip costs are very competitive and some of the money goes to fund his school project so you know you are helping local kids while having a great time!!"

            "review": "An experience of a lifetime. We booked with Himalayan Social journey on a budget package (we are often 5 star travellers)for 15 days of rafting, jungling and trekking (+ some Kathmandhu highlights thrown in). My husband and I joined 3 other people and a couple of different guides for a varied trip of Nepal. Highlights are as follows:-- Rafting down the river (grade 2-3 rapids) - huge amount of fun - followed by sleeping in safari style tents and watching the traffic on one of the craziest roads in the world- Venturing into the jungle and getting up close and personal with elephants, crocodiles, monkeys, white rhino, wild boar (plus seeing quite a few tiger footprints but alas no tigers)- Trekking for 5 days - accomodation on this leg was basic but super clean. All of the lodges had great facilities out of hours - food/drinks/card tables (hot water was a bit hit and miss). The views of the Annapurna mountains were unforgettable and on some days the steps were unforgiving (one day I counted 6500 steps) so not for the faint hearted and there is no alternate path - although you could probably pay to get a helicopter to bypass for a lot of cash! The people, donkeys, horses, children asking for candy were plentiful and definitely added to the experience of the trek.- Kathmandu - checked out lots of stupas, old cities, rug weaving community and some decent food.Our porters Binod (Binod 2) and Kristyna did an amazing job of playing the flute, laughing and carrying on not to mention carrying 20+ kilos each. Special mention goes to our guide for his attention and care throughout the trip - Big Thanks Binod - for such a young guide you really did an awesome job! No detail was too much, no hill too great when Binod was around.Ram - the owner oversaw every detail - his energy and enthusiasm (whilst not unique in Nepal) definitely puts him in a class of his own. He understands Westerners very well having lived overseas for several years, but it is his energy and enthusiasm that make Himalayan Social Journey what it is and make his team want to work there.Overall other comments - Nepal is a basic country in many ways, yet there are highlights around most corners if you look. The people have a great command of English, are super friendly, live in an extremely basic way, yet look well presented, neat & tidy all the time. They have a strong respect for their religion (yet it is not in your face), the souvenirs are incredibly good value and plentiful (from metal work, to woodwork, Gemstones, cashmere, clothes, rugs ...), The scenery outside of Kathmandhu constantly changes and has a raw beauty. Kathmandhu itself is a little crazy like most Asian capitals. It is currently in the middle of widening most of it's city's roads so looks a little like a war zone, and this makes it slow going. It is worth spending a few days in Kathmandhu with a good guide or a good handbook and looking for the treasures that this city has to offer. The rug weaving by the Tibetan community was a highlight for me and the rugs will be a treasured memory of a unique time in a unique place.Thanks to all - we had a great time."

The trek from Lukla to Everest Base Camp was one of my most rewarding life experiences - made better by Himalayan Social Journeys. They have an expert knowledge of Kathmandu, and superior customer care, answering our phone calls from the mountains at any time of day/night and caring for all details of our trip from airport to airport. Most impressively, HSJ donates portions of the trekking fees to improve and provide access to education throughout rural areas of Nepal. So in the end, spending a little extra for is company will not only improve your life, but the lives of many living in the region. You will not regret this."

The highlight of the trip was definitely the 5 days of trekking - hard work but well worth it for the views that you see at the top. Our guide \"R. J.\" and the porters Shiva, Milan, Krishna and Poona who carried our bags kept us entertained with singing and music and motivated us to keep pushing on, even when we were exhausted. All the activities included in the trip were excellent - white water rafting, Kathmandu tour, Chitwan and the rest. I would recommend using Himalayan Social Journeys for any of your Nepal experiences, however ensure that you have a clear idea about what is included in your package as there were several misunderstandings amongst our group."

Also, accomodation and food were excelelnt in country side area.As for the cities sight-seeing part, we were expecting guides to be more pro-active and to tell and explain more things that they did, so this should be improved.But also staff was friendly and helpful.And the aspects that we were not happy with: in the second day, we expected 30-40 min more than agreed pick-up time from hotel. in Bandipur, guides were also for the first time in city so there were no stories&info about place, that we expected."

WELL...the beautiful staff of Himalayan Social Journey made this exciting expedition absolutely perfect.We had never been to Nepal before but longed to see the the dramatic peaks seen from Kathmandu Valley and meet some of the beautiful Nepalese. Our group of 15 was mostly Kiwis and Australians and we all were able to trek along each day according to our ability. Some ran ahead while slower ones followed behind, with everyone accompanied by helpful porters. These young men carried our huge packs without complaint and always with smiles and songs to share. They were just incredible! The quaint and simple lodgings along the trek were owned mostly by smiling, happy people too. The abundant supply of dal bhat and other pasta or rice dishes kept us energised (the local saying was, \"Dal bhat power - 24 hour!\") and we all marvelled in the joy that emanated from those who had absolutely nothing. The very poorest seemed most jubilant of all. We thought it a beautiful life lesson to take home with us.Our lodgings at Kathmandu and Pokhara were a nice standard, and we found some favourite dishes (chilli vegetarian momo was primo) and Everest Beer to enjoy in both places. We had Camel Paks in our daypacks and also had bought a six-pack of toilet paper in Kathmandu, which saw us nicely through the whole trek.Two good ideas would be to bring a couple of long strings of nylon cord and a zip lock bag of detergent. We washed our clothes in sinks as we went along and hung things to dry or wore them on our day packs until they dried. The very best thing we purchased before the trip was a Steripen. It cost a little over $100 but is much better than putting chlorine tablets into water. We used our Steripen (which utilises UV light to steralise water) even in bottled water. It ensured we never got sick and our water was always 99% pure. You'd think you could fill up your water carrier with stream water but we laughed on one occasion where we were all riding on a bus up a hill and saw a clear stream running next to the road with a woman washing her clothes, then further up the road a child was pooping into it! Chlorine tablets taste awful too. The Steripen ensures water keeps its usual taste. There are a few occasions where you are able to only buy water from a lodge's filtered supply. You will absolutely not want to trust your stomachs to that water! Steripen to the rescue again!If you're looking at buying souvenirs, wait until your return to Kathmandu. The little shops have everything you'd find on the trek but at a cheaper price. We hope you have the opportunity to reserve a trek that has some yoga classes in Kathmandu. We had never tried yoga before (and are largely inflexible) but absolutely loved our time with Yogi. He encouraged us to think about how we approach life and let us know how we could find the joy in every day. It was a beautiful way to start each day which made the experience in Nepal so much richer. Our next trip to Nepal will absolutely be with Ram and Himalayan Social Journey. And we'll bring the kids when they're old enough too. After this adventure, we know you're never too young to discover what's most important in life.Enjoy your journey with Ram, Bhinod, Sobit, Raj, Prokars and the others! They make magic happen in Nepal."

I would recommend and will be recommending him and his team to anyone wishing to visit Nepal for any type of visit. We did a 6 day trek through the Annapurna mountains that was officially included in the price of the tour and had a few days sightseeing in and around Kathmandu, however Ram and his team were more than happy to help before and long after we had finished the trek. During the trek all of the team were so helpful and entertaining, much more than just porters, they sang and danced and were all such lovely people! Ram went above and beyond with all of his recommendations and activities he planned for us- one of his guides Vinot even accompanied us to the movies to ensure we didn't get lost. I can not say enough kind words about Ram, his team and the other wonderful people of Nepal. A must visit travel destination and ensure you plan your trip with the help of Ram and Himalayan Social Journey."

Are you prepared to walk up and down thousands of hand-laid stone steps, dodge pony trains and buffalo, laugh out loud between 1000 - 3000 metres, be mesmerised by beautiful scenery and snow capped mountains? Then trek Nepal's Annapurna circuit with Ram's company HSJ. Fortunately our tour was handed over to him due to overbooking by another tour company and thankfully so as Ram was extremely caring and considerate that our every comfort or need was met both on the trek and in Pokhara and Kathmandu. Ram's group of porters were quite frankly the kindest, considerate, polite young men who would ever want to meet - not really speaking much of each others language was never a problem and they are so proud of their country and heritage, their entertainment during the trek and of an evening with their dancing, music and singing is still such a great memory. Once back in Kathmandu visits to all the major tourist sights were well organised with experienced guides. Highly recommend Nepal as a holiday destination - I will be returning there within the year and will certainly use Ram's company as local support."

Once landing in Nepal, they picked us up from the airport and the next day helped us work out what trek we would like to do. Ram, who is the owner, is always smiling and happy and this made it very easy to deal with him. He puts no pressure on you, just gives you the outlines and all the details and lets you choose. They were very helpful and the prices really reasonable. We decided Everest Base Camp Trek would be our chosen journey, and follow in some of the footsteps of our kiwi fellow Sir Edmund Hillary. The flight was all arranged by the company and the transfer to the airport. Our guide Bisnu was amazing!! He lives in the Khumbu region, so you are really supporting local people. He had a great knowledge of the mountain ranges and kept us at ease with any questions we had. All accomadation was booked and organised by Bisnu and the company.We trekked for 11 days up to Kala Pattar and back down, the most memorable experience of our life, seeing that gian mountain Everest is unforgettable!After the trek we also organised through Himalayan Social Journey trekking to go down to Chitwan, where we had three days, two nights organised for us. With bus fares, accomadation, elephant riding, jungle walking all included and organised. Very fun and cultural!My husband and I love the fact that some of the proceeds goes to local charity projects as well.Would reccommend this company to anyone! And when we go back to Nepal we are sure to visit them and be welcomed by their love. Thanks heaps!!!"

Gokurna, Santa and Savin were excellent porters who worked hard to make our trip run smoothly. There was never a time anything was too hard to do.

As hard as it was for us, the encouragement of our guideand porters and patience was very nice to see. We wished we did alonger trek for we truly had much fun!Ram gives his clients really good personal attention, and met us fordinner - the Nepali cultural show. Its really nice to meet with such amotivated and ambitious person who is truly making a difference in theindustry. I believe he has one of the most comprehensive programmesand there are loads of activities you can choose to do with HimalayanSocial Journey - there is even a charity trek.Truly enjoyed it, and I could not had asked for more.

Based on our experience, Ram was very responsive, transparent and did his best to do what we asked.He was very responsive before the trip in terms of organizing our itinerary, insurance, etc. And during our trip he changed our itinerary a few times on our request as bad weather and flight cancellations put our original plans to ruin. When it really mattered - when we were stuck in the mountains in very bad weather and my wife came down with altitude sickness and a virus - he came through for us.While not everything went like clockwork, keep in mind this is Nepal and the standards are not like other countries. Things do go wrong and Ram cannot control everything. He does however always tries his best and works hard to give you the best trip possible and is very reasonably priced.One point of potential confusion: Himalayan Social Journey's website is www.nepalsocial.com.np. There is another, different company called Nepal Social journey who is also run by a Ram, a common name in Nepal."

Unfortunately the team at HSJ just made the whole experience more complicated than it needed to be through poor admin and organisation before, during and at the end of the trip which caused unnecessary stress and anxiety on many in the tour group. Office staff got travel arrangements wrong, left visas to the last minute and accepted little / no responsibility for the stress they put travellers under. and the city tour guide that they offered us for a simple tour of KTM temple monuments was the WORST city guide i have had on any tour anywhere (she lost 1/3 of the group just walking around the outside of one temple!) Thankfully the mountain guide taking us on our tour was knowledgable, humorous, welcoming and just all round great guy.

Our phone calls were well answered by Rameshwar and we were confident in the company from the beginning. Our flight to Katmandu was delayed last minute but our driver Dilip was there waiting for us at the airport at late hours of the night. Binod gave us a warm welcome to the start of our journey. Our city guide Basu was excellent. Our guide Paban is the best guide ever!!! He gave us the best 2 weeks experience in the Himalayas. He got along very well with our teenage son and they were like great mates. Paban is very honest and we completely trusted him with all the decisions. He was always very flexible with our needs. He knew the track to EBC so well and had the knowledge of every turn & terrain. We were fascinated by our strong & humble porters. Ram is a lovely person and was always available when we needed him. Considering how dependent everything is on the weather in the area, you guys do an amazing job with getting people up and down the mountain."

We had beautiful weather, uninterrupted flights, a committed group and most importantly a great guide. With the excellent services of Mingmar Sherpa and his assistants Lakpa and Pasang, this challenging trek seemed like a multi day stroll. Having grown up in the Himalayas Mingmar was very experienced with trekking in the region. He set the right pace for the group with the correct rest periods, he understood altitude sickness and was there to help us deal with it. Infact he was very attentive to our every need. He was willing to share his culture with us and was very knowledgable about the mountains, flora and fauna. Mingmar believed everyone in our group would make it to base camp and we did! Oh yes and one last thing - Mingmar, we loved your jokes and your dancing!"

India was amasing 5 star hotels although our tour guide Ibrihim who was fantastic and very flexible trying to help everyone (15 in our group) apologised because some were only 4 star but was all that was available. When visiting India you must put out of your mind the litter I would not necessarily say filth but litter nothing ever gets picked up it gets swept up but never collected. the Indian people because of their poorness look extremely healthy not the weight problem that effects most countries. I will leave other people to describe the attractions. I cannot say much more other than if time permits i will do the same tours next year.

HSJ made this possible with a minimum of fuss! So - Mumbai it was for 3 days, in well located boutique Hotel Fariyas which is not far from the iconic Taj Hotel & surrounds. Followed by a \"wishlist\" to stay at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (aka Ravla Khempur). Although it was a fair distance from Udaipur, itself an attractive Indian city, we had an out-of-this-world hospitality from the owner + Nitin and his Team.The main tour itself was a mixture of experiences reflecting what India was all about. Our escort, Ibrahim, was quick to adapt to our humour & tricks, We hope he had an equally good time with us, albeit the inevitable challenges we gave him must have stretched his patience. I am personally eternally grateful to Mr Lovely (our driver from Delhi / Jaipur / Agra) and his trainee (Ajay) for delivering us safely to our destinations. Traffic in India is indeed hair-raising!So many forts, historical tombs, etc. to see & visit but of course the greatest of them all - the Taj Mahal, was something to behold.Varanassi was rather confronting, with rituals and ceremonies too much to comprehend.The train trip from Agra was part of the Luxury Escape package; whilst it is an adventure of sort to have done it ... strongly recommend to opt for the flight back to Delhi (at whatever cost really!!).Hard to remember the names of all our city tour guides, but thank you all the same for your interesting info's and facts.Nepal was also customised by us, and found this a slower pace than the bustle of India. Other than some confusions on our transport arrangements, Ram and his team accommodated us to the best they can. Better to get out of Kathmandu and head for Nagarkot and Pokhara. Loved our mini-trek to the Oz Camp where we had stunning views of the Annapurna Ranges and Fishtail mountain. We bonded with some Nepali college students who happily joined us in our bonfire (reciprocal Aussie hospitality, I guess!). Special TY to Dipi, Dilip, and our porters. There will always be stuff to improve on the tour organisation and choices of activities. It can be frustrating when processes are slow, but this is India and Nepal. Our group kept an open mind prior to our trip and did not assume any level of expectation ... means we had a lot of fun, even if there are dozens of holy cows always getting in our way!!!Back to home sweet home Australia (where order is the norm), with so much priceless memories.With thanks to HSJ-India / HSJ-Nepal."

Our tour consisted of rafting, visiting Chitwan national park, trekking on the Annapurna circuit for 5 days including Poon Hill, and visiting the Kathmandu valley. The experience was truly astounding! I can't ask for better tour guides, porters and travel companions. It was a short time but it feels like we'd been together for months and everyone got so close together like a family. The tour was very well organised and the guides - Binod and Ganesh were so friendly, fun, professional and always made sure that everyone was happy and healthy. Be open minded and don't have too high expectation as you're not going to stay in resorts with spa or luxurious hotels all the time. Some accommodations we stayed during the trek were very basic. However considering the conditions there, where people live on the high altitude and lack of facility, I was contented and was always fascinated by the view from our rooms. I'm glad I went on this trip and get to know about Nepal, one of the poorest countries but has people with kindest hearts. Will totally recommend Himalayan Social Journey to anyone. Thanks for the amazing experience! This is my first and won't be my last visit."

It was well organised and perfectly guided.Our trip started in Kathmandu and left for rafting after one day. The rafting was great fun as we drifted down the river. Stayed in a tent resort, which was right on the river, and was a good experience. Onto Chitwan, where we canoed, walked and rode elephants through the national park. Saw 7 endangered rhinos which was fantastic. Next was Pokhara, which was lovely and the departure point for our 5 day trek. The trek was unreal (but hardish) , porters were part of the package. Five unforgettable days of climbing into the lower Annapurnas with spectacular views along the way. The lodges were more than adequate and usually had cold beer.Returned to Kathmandu and stayed at the Gokarna Resort which was ok. But make sure they put you in the new section and not the old. This was not as good as the other ordinary hotels. Played golf here and enjoyed it. Shared the course with deer and monkeys. Also extended the massage time and it was great.Hotels on the trip were good. All air conditioned and mostly had hot water.  The trip was made very memorable by our great guide- Ram. One of the best guides we have experienced in all our travels.Our trip was great value and we would highly recommend it."

            "review": "Buyer beware. Firstly - I don't appreciate a follow-up email from a tour operator soliciting a 5 star review on trip advisor! Booked this trip through Luxury Escapes; initially the emails sent out by HSJ were quite helpful, however as the trip drew closer emails were ignored or contradictory ,and what turned out to be blatantly untrue information was sent out.HSJ are incredibly disorganised, transport did not arrive at arranged times and after our arrival in Lukla we ended up sitting around waiting for several hours for another group to arrive ( they never did) - I'm guessing this was to try and save a few dollars by using the same set of yaks for two groups, rather than having to pay porters. Accommodation was generally of a very poor standard - mouldy rooms / mouldy curtains/ filthy bathrooms / dirty bedlinen (complete with fleas). The exceptions were Sherpaland Lodge in Namche, and Sherpa Guide Lodge in Phakding ( this place was amazing, lovely owners, spotlessly clean). Despite being told there would be a guide plus a porter for every two people, instead we had a guide plus a yak driver. With a group of twelve people, this is just foolish - there is no way one guide can keep an eye on that many people of differing levels of fitness. We ended up \"borrowing\" a porter from a group running in parallel ( a lovely 17yo guy with just a few words of English). I really felt sorry for our guide; when 4 members of our group became sick and needed to be evacuated, HSJ really didn't seem to be giving the guide sufficient support to deal with the situation.The whole operation ( especially the sleazy owner who couldn't answer any of the questions put to him at our pre-trip briefing) seems to be a bit dodgy; I'm really not sure how they managed to hook up with Luxury Escapes, as the standard of the trip really doesn't match up with the other operators who work with Luxury Escapes.My recommendation would be to give this operator a wide berth, and organise a trip yourself directly with a freelance guide - you will have much more flexibility and hopefully avoid the unhygienic accommodation!"

We trained for 4 months, spent around $2,000 on the right gear, hopefully to ensure success. Unfortunately Social Journey Himalaya are quite disorganised so one needs to be prepared to go with the flow. In Nepal things change all the time so maybe being disorganised and not structured is a plus!! The tea houses which were used on the way to Base Camp were filthy!! I would definitely question the accommodation on the trek before booking. Because of isolation one can accept that there is no heating, no showers, no lighting at night and very basic sqat toilets. What is very difficult to get past is the filth of the facilities. In one tea house two of our team members ended up with bedbug bites . We had a wonderful Sherpa called Shree Tamang. Shree was far better, helpful, supportive and kind than the head guide for our group. Without this Sherpa I doubt if we could have made this incredibly demanding journey.Social Journey Himalaya also have a hotel in Katmandu- the Holy Himalaya. This hotel is in a great position and is clean. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Even though hot water is only available in some rooms between 6-9 it is still quite adequate. It's like a big backpackers where everyone congregates in the dining area to swap stories. I would definitely stay at the Holy Himalaya again."

We agreed to a 7am flight only to be told we weren't flying until midday. After 3 hours of arguing the helicopter company admitted they never had an available helicopter and that the tour operator OWNED the business also.After many arguments, the operator put us onto another operator and we were in the air within 15mins....!Once we arrived in the Himalayas we started to explore different restaurants in each village each night only to be told off by our guide for doing so...it turns out the operator gets the rooms for free if the guests buy food each night from teahouse. So dodgey!While our guide was \"OK\" we still streamed miles ahead of him each day and struggled with the constant fake facts that were made up on the spot. One of my favourites was \"Mt Everest View Hotel is the largest hotel in the world\". When I questioned it, he simply said \"check Guinness book of records\". He's clearly never been to Las Vegas....So overall, i need to warn future trekkers....Book it yourself! There was absolutely no upside using an operator. Just fly to Kathmandu, book a guide + sherpa online and flights to Lukla. Your guide will organise your accommodation at the teahouses. Simple."

Mingmar was always very informative of the environment around us: mountains, flora and fauna, villages, nepalese lifestyles, religion, foods. He helped us understanding the Sherpa culture and appreciate it!Our trek has been a unique experience also because of our two fabulous porters Lakpa and Pasang.

On our five day trek we were looked after so well, Ram did everything necessary to make sure everyone was comfortable 24/7. The rafting experience was a great icebreaker for the group and we everyone gelled so well together. It might sound corny but it was like one big happy family. The variety of the trip with Chitwan, rafting, city tour, trek, Gokharna and Pokhara (where we spent an extra two days because we loved it so much, we were to spend extra days in Gokharna but 2 days is enough there) was a great mix and I can't believe how much we fitted in to our time there - it was done at a good pace.

I just completed the 14 day Poon Hill, Chitwan National Park and white water rafting adventure with the Himalayan Social Journey. The whole trip was an adventure with lots of variety. The trekking to Poon Hill and back to Pokhara was a beautiful experience. With any mountain trek into the Himalayas it did have lots of up hills and down dale but the views and the experience was worth it. The Nepalese are a kind and gentle people always with a smile and a helping hand. Our trip was made special by the other travellers who happened to turn up in our group and most of all by the quality of the guides and porters who looked after us every step of the way. I need to make special mention of Raju our experienced and attentive tour guide who lead a group of 9 older Australians, all well over 50 to new heights. Our porters also helped each one of us, some holding the arms of weary trekkers as they climbed at the end of the day. Rupesh carried our bag and all the while waited on us and shared his life story with us. The same can be said for Perdip, Dinesh and Rajan who each cared for one of the group along the 7 days on the mountain. Hearing their stories of life in Nepal especially since the devastating earthquake made our journey such a personal one. Special and memorable. On some evenings the guide and porters would dance to traditional Nepalese music and encourage us trekkers to do the same making for a good laugh and fun time. If you want a holiday that is fun, challenging, full of interesting sights and in a beautiful landscape then this trip ticks all the boxes. The only down side of the trip was the endless traffic due to poor roads in Nepal. If you fly and not drive to Pokhara and Chitwan then it is the perfect trip. (They say the roads will be better in a few years but until then fly). There is something magical about the resilience and positive attitude of the people of Nepal and the towering landscape of the Himalayas that make the place special. I will be back!"

Had the most fantastic experience. We were looked after from the minute we arrived at Kathmandu airport where the driver picked us up and took us to the Hotel. We found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. Following day met Ram and introduced us to our guide for the trek. Have to say what an incredible person Milan is, he is so competent and has so many great qualities, we always knew we were in safe hands, nothing was too much trouble and is great company. Have to also mention that Roopeszz our porter is such a respectful young person and also took great care of us, again nothing was too much trouble. Their job was to look after us but they went over and beyond what was expected. We took the tourist bus with Milan from Kathmandu to Pokhara which is a very long journey and from Pokhara drove for about an hour to begin our trek. HSJ does specify that to enjoy the trek it's best to prepare yourself with uphill climbing beforehand, I believed that by regular walking and running would be enough but it isn't. To enjoy the trek, it's best to prepare with a good level of hill walking and as we didn't we found it hard but nonetheless was fantastic journey. Nepal is simply beautiful.All the activities we did were simply fantastic, white water rafting was great fun, Chitwan National park with the elephant ride, jungle walk, canoe ride was awesome.Was a totally fascinating experience made possible by our wonderful guide Milan and Roopeszz our porter. So just want to say thank you HSJ for the opportunity given to us for a holiday of a lifetime and recommend anyone to experience this amazing holiday. You will not be disappointed."

Our family loved it, especially our 12 and 14 year old girls. Himalaya Social Journey were faultless, well organised, punctual, very helpful, a great itinerary and fantastic staff! Our guide, Bishnu Bhattarai, and head porter/assistant, Tikaram, did a great job and were alot of fun - they really made our trip such a positive experience and so willing to help at all times. Nepal is very beautiful and so interesting, the people are very friendly and nice. The food is also great!"

HSJ has always been very responsive to questions, and offer excellent trekking packages. This time, I was very excited about my trip to Everest Base Camp. We had some extra days before and after the trip and HSJ was able to accommodate all our needs. HSJ has promoted heavily though Luxury Escapes, and their schedule was very busy when we arrived. This was somewhat problematic, as it appeared we were going to have to move to a different start date. It was sorted out to our satisfaction in the end. Binod provided good communication prior to the trek. Bishnu Basnet was our guide, and a better guide can not be found. He cared for all of us in an amazing way. We became a family and all successfully completed the trek under Bishnu's careful guidance. I'm not going to say everything was seamless, and the organization by HSJ was not perfect. There was some errors by them along them along the way. I largely thought it was due to communication problems at a higher level in the organization, combined with it being a very busy season. That said, it is Nepal, and one often has to accept things happen a certain way in Nepal. If you can't deal with 'Nepal Time' then maybe go elsewhere. It is also a measure of a company that they acknowledge their errors and overcome any obstacles. HSJ did so every time. Overall, it's a five star experience, and HSJ try to do all they can to ensure you get all 5 stars. "

            "review": "Everest Base Camp: Challenge Yourself. My wife and I are adventure travellers and as a rule like to do things our own way and avoid group travel. When the opportunity arose to travel to Everest Base Camp with Himalayan Social Journey we were hesitant and did a fair bit of research into the company, structure of the trek and read lots of reviews. In the end we decided to give it a go. Altitude is a great leveller. You can be as fit as you like but unless you prepare both mentally and physically and have the right equipment you will struggle. This trek has a lot of uphill, downhill, rough ground, wind, cold, rain and throw in lack of oxygen above 3000m, well, discomfort.We got lucky. Our guide Bishnu, was informative and professional. He was constantly monitoring the group and advising on what and when was happening. He was also very experienced in Himalayan Trekking and understood altitude sickness and how to deal with it. Our group had prepared correctly and everyone understood what needed to be done to get up and down from EBC. The program for our group worked well. There was the right pace, correct rest periods and the food was adequate. If you are after five star accomodation then that is not going to happen on this trek. The accomodation is basic but allows you to prepare for the next day.The flights to Lukla are totally dependent on weather situations. If it is cloudy there will be no flights. You may lose a day either side of your trek because of this so you need to have a buffer in your travel plans and good insurance.Make sure you have a solar battery charger or a couple of charged battery packs. Once you get above Namchee Bazaar you will have to pay a fair bit to get devices charged. Water purification is essential. Get a Ultra Violet wand or water purification tablets and try them before you leave to get used to the taste. Merino will be you best friend. It is warm and keeps the smell away. Spend the money on a merino buff. The cold air will hurt your throat and the buff keeps your breath moist and face warm.Prepare to climb and descend. You may need to consult a fitness professional or a trekking organisation to fully understand how to do this. The literature that comes with the H.S.J. Trekking information suggests that you may not have to train at all. Not true. You need to be able to walk up and down rough tracks in hiking boots with a pack on your back whilst keeping hydrated for up to six hours with breaks. If you have trouble doing that at sea level then you will need to train until you are comfortable.The rescue helicopters do a roaring trade in trekking season. For example in a group of Brits who were trekking on a similar schedule, they lost five out of ten at Gorak Shep. The HSJ group in front of us lost two. All were evacuated to Lukla or Kathmandu. Each day there was a procession of rescues.If you have access to an altitude training room near you, try it. It is a great confidence booster and most of the people who run them are seasoned trekkers who are willing to help.This trek was great for us. We got clear weather, uninterrupted flights, good guiding staff and more importantly, a committed and well prepared group of people who bonded well and supported each other."

We had the time of our lives and we were already looking up flights for a return visit before we even got home! I cannot speak highly enough of the guides and porters we had, particular Binod and Ganesh, they cannot do enough for you and work every waking minute to make sure the entire groups every need are always met. The treks are not easy but these men make you feel very safe and happy every step of the way. The scenery is spectacular and the the food and accommodation is of a very adequate standard. The group we were in was quite large but we all became great friends by the end. Value for money is definitely delivered here. I would not hesitate to recommend this company, the guides and country to anyone seeking a beautiful challenge in life. Thank you Nepal! See you again soon!"

The trek was inspiring, challenging and we are still amazed at what we accomplished. HSJ wisely divided our initial large group into two and gave those of us over a certain age an extra day to complete the circuit--we needed it and we were very grateful! Our very positive experience must be directly attributed to the attention and care of our guide, Raju and the strength and good-will of our porters, Perdip, Rupesh, Dinesh and Rajan. In particular, I must commend Raju for making sure each of us safe and cared-for on the trek while encouraging us and taking time to focus on the scenery and environment. His confident grip on my arm helped me navigate many stairs and rough terrain. Raju also directed the team of porters to stay close to the members of the group as we each hiked at our own pace. Our safety was clearly the top priority. We have already recommended HSJ privately and are happy to add our comments on Trip Advisor. Our advice for prospective trekkers: Get in shape! Make sure your training includes steps--you'll encounter many on your journey near the top of the world."

Bishnu and Tengee were also super helpful and we had a great time with these guys too.Despite bad weather creating a disjointed start to our trek (some of the party in Lukla and others left in KTM), HSJ managed to get all 16 of us on the mountain together from Naamche Bazaar onwards. And though we were initially concerned with travelling in such a large group, it was FANTASTIC! Great people who made the experience once in a lifetime and memorable for us. Accommodation is mostly basic but with some lovely spots added to the mix to keep our precious Western needs met (Gokarna at the end of the trip was beautiful). Totally awe inspiring experience and seriously not too hard (yet challenging at times).We highly recommend Himalayan Social Journey and especially Guide Ganga.

We used Himalayan Social Journey for a fortnight's trip to Nepal, on the recommendation of our daughter, who had done a brief trek with them two years ago. We were not disappointed! From the moment of booking, Ram kept in touch and answered all my questions about our trip, booking an extra night in a hotel on our arrival and arranging a flight to Everest. Nothing was too much trouble for Ram and this was the case for all the staff of Himalayan Social Journey. We did five days' trekking in the Annapurnan foothills and our guide, Bishnu Bhattarai, was absolutely superb. He was full of information about Nepal and the places we were visiting and was unfailingly cheerful and full of energy. Our assistant guide, Tikkaram, was super helpful and went out of his way to help us. Our porters carried our loads with ease and provided great entertainment in the evenings at our tea houses, singing and dancing for us (and getting us up to dance as well! I won't forget Bishnu's dance moves in a hurry!). The trip combined some time in Kathmandu, white water rafting, safari in Chitwan, trekking in beautiful mountain landscape and some rest and relaxation in Pokhara. Throughout the whole trip we were looked after superbly and learned a lot about this beautiful country and its wonderful people. The whole trip ran like clockwork (apart from the road network, which is outside anyone's control!) and nothing was too much trouble for Bishnu and our team of porters. I whole heartedly recommend Himalayan Social Journey to anyone who wants to explore the amazing country that is Nepal, a country that you can't only visit once. Thanks to Ram and his team for making our trip so special."

I first saw Himalayan Social journey on Groupon but went on their website and found the 9N/10D Kathmandu - Pokhara Tour and Trekking with two night Luxury 5 Star Accommodation (4*/5* Accommodation). I added on an extra day ($45 hotel), Everest flight ($220), a sightseeing trip to Bhaktapur ($30), rafting ($35), paragliding ($100), private driver to Pokhara ($70) and added on the single supplement ($350)- all $ are usd. I booked in February and the email communication with Ram was responded to fast with clear information. Pick up at airport was easy (go outside and look for sign in the throng of people across the road). I was taken to the office to pay, exchange currency (great rate) and then get a SIM card on way to Hotel Holy Himalaya (great location and breakfast but terrible shower, no restaurant - try Gaia at the top of the street). The tour went ahead even though I was the only person. I got to do all of my activities and a cooking class ($A50) which was very lucky considering the weather.Please keep in mind that Nepal is a developing country and roads, traffic, language and culture is very different to your home country. Traffic in Thamel is crazy (cars, trucks, buses, trucks, tuk tuk's, cows, dogs, motorbikes and pedestrians all sharing bumpy dirt roads). I learnt to be patient and go along with what was transpiring, insist on the itinerary being honoured, pay extra at times (for guides, a bag - duffle bag not available, taxis) and everything turned out in the end (it was stressful at times though, especially when told flights, sightseeing, accommodation, massages won't go ahead as stated on the itinerary, however this did get sorted eventually).Rafting was fun but was told it was a 2 hour bus ride and 4 hour rafting. But was a 4 hour bus ride and 2 hour rafting. You get very muddy so make sure you keep a change of cloths handy to change at the end (there is no shower). The Mount Kailash Hotel in Pokara was very plush and had a great overhead shower and well priced restaurant. Pokhara is much quieter than Thamel. The guides and drivers were very good. The trek was fun and Ganesh my guide was very helpful and attentive. The walk to Dhampus is 3 hours of slate stair climbing, which was taxing on the legs. We walked through villages, past schools, fabulous mountain peak views and through forest (done leeches). The accommodation on the trek (Hotel Greenland in Dhampus, Australian Guesthouse at Australian Camp and Hotel Mountain Garden at Sarangkot all had an ensuite) add on 100npr for each shower (even if cold at Sarangkot) and 100npr for wifi, which will only be working when power is on). You order all meals through the guide and pay before leaving. Definitely give the paragliding a go, you will experience what it is like to be an eagle. September was quite warm and I only needed a jumper on one night. If taking the flight from Pokhara to Katmandu get a seat on the left side (is free seating) for a view of Mount Everest Range. The Gonkarna Rainforest Resort is about 30 -60 mins out of Thamel depending on traffic. It is a nice resort but is in need of a refurb. Monkeys are around in the morning and you can hear them in the trees at night. Try the yoga on the rooftop, Uma was fantastic. Overall I had a great trip but you need to be tolerant. If you are short on time I would definitely recommend this tour. I had a trip full of great memories. Make sure you have your itinerary on you to verify what is supposed to happen. It is a good idea to download Thamel and Pokhara maps to your smartphone, to help you find your way around. "

We can and will heartily recommend to trek with Himalyan Social Journey, since their guides are very experienced and really look out for you. Five stars from us!!"

            "review": "Preparation is key!. We booked a 14night Poon Hill (Annapurna ranges) trek with 2 night Gokarna Forest stay with this company and I cannot speak more highly of our guide Raju and his team of 4 porters, Tikarum in particular. My husband, 15yo daughter and myself felt that we had done enough physical training (me less so) but I will say this is not an entry level trek by Australian standards. I struggled on day 2 - there are alot of slate stairs of varying heights (9000 in one day) which at this time of year after monsoon can be slippery and treacherous. Having said that, the compassion and kindness shown to me by Raju really did bring me to tears (I was also sick, dehydrated and suffering mild altitude sickness as well but that's another story!) Both Raju and Tikarum were there patiently beside me waiting to steady the slightest stumble and I cannot thank them enough. Food along the trek is surprisingly western (roast potato, pizza etc) and some of the tea house accom is a little.....agricultural, but that is all part of the fun. If travelling during Sept you will need very little in the way of warm clothes and thermals definately not needed. We were certainly not prepared for the warm weather walking through the mountains - tshirts and shorts (covering the thighs) are adequate. Watch out for leeches and mosquito's and bring antiseptic, anti itch cream and most definately sunscreen. Breathtaking views are the reward for your gard work!If there is a criticism, it is of the front end organisation. Emails from Australia were always answered promptly however once in Nepal we found that communication was lacking. Messages were often left to guiding staff to pass on and sort out where this clearly was an admin job that should be sorted at the end of the trek. I'm referring specifically to incorrect requests for payments that had already been paid however no receipts were ever given so check and recheck and always get a receipt. As a side note, the guide and porters rely on tips to support their meagre pay packets so leave your stingy pants at home and support these guys - they are worth every cent!"

Overall, everything was absolutely fantastic.Before leaving Australia, HSJ were extremely responsive to emails answering every question I had quickly and with great detail. Even when we had to change some of our pre and post accommodation, Ram was extremely helpful and responsive. The trek itself was excellent. Our guide Raju was wonderful - he is knowledgable, personable, fun, caring, helpful and compassionate. We had a mixed group of fitness levels and he encouraged everyone to just go at their own pace. One of our group was extremely ill and he lead her through three really tough days getting her safe and sound to the next guesthouse. And our porters .... Incredible men - always smiling, nothing too much trouble - just wonderful. The only feedback I would provide is around communication during the trek itself - yes, sometimes things got lot in translation but it would be good to have a clear idea of what the day ahead will bring. I also think that having to pay for hot showers and electricity on top of what we already paid is unrealistic. Yes, it's only a dollar or two, but the tour price should include all of this. That notwithstanding, we had a wonderful trip and one that will stay with us for a lifetime. And, if we ever to forget, the photos of the Annapurna ranges will be there to remind us .... What a stunning location!!"

He looked after us around the clock 24/7 wether it be walking step for step with you struggling up a hill or checking in on you if not feeling well. He even helped my partner with a marriage proposal and supplied a birthday cake. He and every single one of our porters were the support that kept us going. These boys(men) became our family. We could not have asked for better service from them at all. The trek itself was truly amazing but completely different to my expectations but simply the best holiday yet. The guest houses on the trek days were what we expected and the food far exceeded our expectations but there were extra costs every step of the way we did not expect from tipping to paying for showers, paying for wifi and paying to charge your electronics. We didn't mind this cost but if informed you can be better prepared. Overall a trip of a lifetime and one I hope to do again."

We did a 12 day Katmandu, Pokhara and Poon Hill trek, first of all we would like to thank Ram for answering all of our question and helping us to fine tune our trip so that all went smoothly. We were picked up at the airport in Kathmandu without any fuss and taken to the office to meet with Ram and he explained some of the details of our trip and that we would be meeting our tour guide Narendra Timalsina. We meet later that evening for a cultural dinner and he explained that he would be our guide for the trek and we were pleased to hear that he had many years experience trekking around Nepal. and we knew we would be in good hands. He told us that our porter would be Roopeszz Crest and he would be joining us in Pokhara the following morning. The next morning we meet with Roopeszz and found him to be a great young man with a big smile and great sense of humour.We began our trip after breakfast by catching the tourist bus to Pokhara and spent the night in Pokhara at a very nice hotel they choose for us \"Splendid View Hotel\" before leaving on a 90 minute mini van drive to Naya Pul the next morning where we began our trek. The first day was to be a 7 Klm trek to Tikhedhunga which was mostly uphill and through local villages, we stayed overnight at the \"Shankar Guest House\". The guesthouse was clean and basic with shared facilities. The following morning day 2, after breakfast we trekked to Ghorepani rather long day of all uphill trekking doing the famous 3280 stairs in the first 2 hours followed by even more stairs and a walk of some 13.4 Klm. Our guide Narendra always ensured that each rest stop had magnificent views tonight he booked us into the \"Nice Viewpoint Lodge\" great location youth hostel feel basic/clean with superb views we were not disappointed. Day 3 we were up early to walk the 45 to 60 minute walk up another 450 mtrs and yes more stairs to Poon Hill for a stunning sunrise and so worth it, take a warm jacket and buy a coffee at the top the views were magnificent, stunning and utterly amazing to see the beautiful Himalayans. Returned back to Lodge for breakfast before setting off again to trek through some stunning rainforests before arriving at Tadapani where we stayed at the \"Hotel Magnificent \" which served the best spring rolls. Day 4 we left Tadapani for Landruk stoping at Ghandruk and viewing the Visitors Centre which was very informative before descending to the valley floor more steps down this time before winding our way up the other side and yes more stairs, lots more stairs, again Narendra had booked us into a very nice hotel \"Super View Guesthouse \" this local couple were very friendly and have prime real estate allowing views up and down the valley most defiantly a place to stop and some rooms have private facilities.Day 5 we made our way to Pothana easier walking today but still the views keep on coming the accomodation was very limited Pothana showed you magnificent views of \"Fishtail\" Day 6 we walk on to Phedi which was all downhill, remember take your trekking poles,the Nepal people have a saying \"a little bit up, a little bit down\" and nothing could be truer.Our guide was knowledgeable, informative, courteous and very polite and he was always patient and gave us encouragement when we needed it. Our porter Roopeszz was a very polite young man and always had a smile every day. He always had our bags in our room by the time we arrived at the hotel. Both guide and porter are a credit to Himalayan Social Journey.Himalayan Social Journey are the company you should consider when thinking of doing any trekking in and around Nepal"

While Binny was away, Dipak had to step up and lead our crew for the top end of the journey. With the support of Shaila (our very own yak man) they got the rest of us safety to Base Camp for an incredible afternoon.

Our group had different walking speeds but he always looked out for everyone and made sure everyone was walking at a good pace for themselves. With altitude sickness being very common he also made sure we were very open and honest about how we were feeling so we could keep ourselves healthy. Mingmar was always happy to help and was very informative of the flora, forna and mountains. He was also able to explain about the traditional Nepalese ways as well as the origins of names, traditional foods/baking/relationships. We really learned an awful lot about the Himalayan way of life and this made our experience even richer! I would definitely recommend a trip with Mingmar as your guide and I honestly cannot think of a more honest and caring person to help you through the difficult trek."

We had a big group and I was the youngest in the group and by myself but I never felt alone with these guys. Bishnu was great at translating to english and made sure everyone was informed and taken care of. I had lots of fun with Bishnu, having a drink when it was over and many laughs throughout the trek. Ganga is one of the most fit people I have ever meet and the passion he has for he's County and culture is astonishing. You can feel at ease that anything you need will be attended to even if he has to carry you down or up or just bring you a hot cup of tea for your throat. ( Bring lozenges ;) )Both Bishnu and Ganga are highly experienced and have a wealth full of knowledge in there heads about the culture of the lands, it's traditions the heart and soul of their country. The company was excellent in accommodating any changes and needs of each and every member of my trek, I could not recommend them high enough. I even booked a second trip while I was there because there quality for price was so good. The beginning starts with a tour of the nearby tourist attractions for free but you will need to pay the entrance fee which is $2- $15 depending on where you want to go but if you simply want to explore than you are free to or want to leave early they will organise a taxi or bus to take you where to go and negotiate price on your behalf. Again I have to mention Ganga and Bishnu if possible to ask for them as your tour guides as you will not be in more safer, experienced, caring and knowledgeable hands. A tip is expected at the end but not mandatory but these guys deserve it and don't be stingy"

Other than the fabulous scenery, the fantastic raft trip, the lovely food - our outstanding memory is of our guide Ganga. He played the role of tutor of the Nepalese culture and flora and fauna, general trek guide, mountain trek guide, waiter, first aider, friend, accountant and much much more! He is knowledgeable, approachable and we felt safe and confident in his abilities. The 5 stars awarded this trip goes to him. We had a mixed group of different ages and this worked for the group dynamic. You require a moderate level of fitness for the trek but we found it extremely enjoyable and rewarding. The organisation of the company was very good and they arranged accommodation before and after the trip in a decent hotel.

(This post was posted earlier and unknowingly removed without notice)Although we enjoyed our Nepal trip (thanks to the beautiful nature and our wonderful guides/porters), the experience with HSJ was not entirely pleasant.The tour package is not recommended for those who may want to make changes to the itinerary as deviations (as suggested by HSJ before you embark on the journey) are costly. Not all exclusions (e.g. entrance fees to sightseeing places) are stated clearly and actual charges could be higher than quoted (e.g. we were told 3 different prices for optional flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu while we were in Nepal). Our poor guide has to work while he's unwell as there's no replacement. And our portals worked harder to double up as impromptu guide instead.Consider HSJ only if you stick to the original itinerary, are willing to pay high extra costs, and don't mind compromises due to unforeseen circumstances."

We ate well, enjoying the local fare, discovered particularly good apple pies, drank satisfying masala tea. We shared the paths of small mountain ponies and goats.

The magnificent green everywhere of the forests and rice paddys. Not to mention the spectacular mountains. Another bonus for travelling at this time of year is that there are far less tourists and you can make some last minute decisions such as deciding on booking the Scenic Everest flight changing to private transfers etc. Himalayan Social Journey's team were great with correspondence before we arrived in Nepal and then we're brilliant in every way throughout our tour.

Our group was 4 adults and 4 children aged 12-16 and all had average to good fitness and flew through the trek. The itinerary was great and just the right amount of planned activities. Our guides were Binod and Raju and they were great. One of the kids ended up sick and could not trek with us, so Binod organised for a porter to stay at Pokerah and bring them up when he was well enough and we met up at the halfway point. When we ended up wanting to walk longer on the last day and cut the trek shorter, Binod just sorted it. While we of course had to pay for the extra accommodation, Binod and Rjau just sorted anything that arose, or we raised, easily. The itinerary allowed plenty of Kathmandu exploration both guided and independent. The standard of accommodation ranged from exceptional to good. Everyone we came across in Nepal was friendly and the team at Himalayan Social Journey was no different. This time of year was monsoon season however the weather was exceptional."

Nepal is a gem of a country, Pokhara being my favourite town. We did the trek to Australian camp. I found the first day very challenging, but my guide Rameshwar stuck by my side and gently encouraged me along. The accommodation up the mountain is very basic, but the food, alcohol and company was ample recompense. Many thanks to all my guides especially \"esqui\", DILIP, Rameshwar and our wonderfully gentle but strong porters."

It was very well organised and on the first day we were given an in depth itinerary with extra costs of monument visits and a guide as to how much was recommended to give to drivers and guides as tips. This was very helpful as I did not have a clue what to give and they pass around an envelope so it is discreet and comes from the group not an individual :-) Our guide for the entire journey was very helpful and came with us to the markets to ensure our safety. He also went to the hospital with a very sick member of our group and then joined us the next day with limited sleep! I think it was not just the beautiful places we saw in India that made this trip, it was the people and their willingness to go above and beyond their call of duty. I would highly recommend HSJ and I enjoyed it so much I am considering their tour of Nepal."

Communications from HSJ prior to the trip were outstanding and they couldn't have been more helpful.The trip itself was a great experience as a family, which gets harder to achieve on family holidays and the children get older!Our guide Ram was fantastic - incredibly attentive, aware and tuned in to his group to make sure everyone was getting the appropriate level of support and contact. Opened up more as the trip progressed and Ram was able to give us some really interesting insights into Nepalese life. Felt much more like being with a really competent and knowledgeable friend than a guide!Only point I'd suggest checking is size of group - we were fortunate to be in a small group but there were some points where we combined with a larger group. This all worked out well but it may be a variation from what some travellers expect.Bottom line - great trip with a great company and our family absolutely recommends HSJ."

It all went relax. The sherpa was very experienced, helpfull and did everything to help me giving a great trekking. There was enough possibility to do the trekking at my OWN rhythm. I had the safe feeling of hicking alone. Sherpa Mingmar asked every evening feedback from the day and explained what the plan was for the day after. It was a great program. The hostels where we slept where good. We left every day around 7.30-8.00h and had only rain in the evenings. The views where spectaculair. We could see the Annapurna south and the Fishtail. There was time to stop and take a break at some teahouses on the way. I really can recommend this trip to everybody alone. It was a beautiful hike to remember.

            "review": "Disappointment. To begin with, in general I liked villages I visited, most of locals were very nice. However this review is not about the country but about the agency. My trek was in October 2015. I did not buy any package tour, basically I asked for a porter and a guide. The tourists are promised a lot in the emails and orientation by the agency. For example, I was promised to get a tourist bus, an English speaking guide, a sleeping bag and trekking poles among others.Although I did not really want having a city tour, the agency nevertheless inserted this trip into my 12 day trek. That is why my trek consisted of 9 days only or may be even less.... In reality, the city tour turned out to be a disaster. The so called city tour guide was very unprofessional and kept asking me personal questions which were intimidating (my salary, hotel price, etc). I got little information about Nepal and the history, but I heard a lot on the guide's political views about the politics in my country instead. He showed me only 20-30 percent of each place as he was in hurry. Honestly, this old man just ruined my morning. He did not hesitate to ask for tips. Those who work, deserves to be rewarded.Second, I was not provided with trekking poles but was given two bamboo sticks by the mountain guide, which were very inconvenient. The sleeping bag that I was given did not look very clean, do they wash it before a new trek? I had been asked to send a copy of my passport for TIMS and permits a month in advance, which I did. Yet, nobody had ever told me that I should bring a few photos with me for these documents (but thanx to forums with lots of info!). So, till the early morning before the departure on trek, my TIMS and permits were not prepared, the bus tickets were not bought. After a city tour Ram explained me in the office that it was the duty of the mountain guide and he came back from another trek in the late evening before departure! I had a wonderful night full of doubts. Unbelievable! And so many ppl staying in the office. Nex morning, I received a message from a mountain guide at 6 a.m. that he would pick me up in 30 minutes!!! Moreover, there was no tourist bus as I had to use local bus and sit at the back. Did you know how many people die as a result of bus accidents per month in Nepal? All these local buses are overcrowded and drivers drive very aggressively! HSJ showed a little regard to my safety. So we drove in the local bus at the beginning and at the end of trek which took in total 2 days. Guide and porter were not doing anything special in the bus so why should they be paid a full price?Mountain guide' English level was very very low. Basically, they provided me with a porter at the guide\u2019s price. His main duty was to bring me from one lodge to another and take a food order. He never let me pay directly to the lodge owner for food and room. Moreover, the people provided by the agency (guide and porter) never had a medical kit, they had no proper walking shoes and only 1 pair of warm gloves for 2 people (no towels, no sleeping bags, etc.). Oh, yes, they had green polo shirts with HSJ logo. I also got one. The locals always cough and sneeze. I asked some questions concerning safety and well-being and I received an answer \u201cWe are used to\u201d. So if I would have a health issue he would just go to lodge (2-3h walking) and call to the agency because his phone was always off (no money on sim card after many calls to his family). They were entertaining, positive and kind young people, but on 4000m attitudes I need knowledge, experience and equipment because it is not a journey to Disneyland. So this agency is exploiting the personnel, treating them like slaves and cheating on tourists. Do you want to support the schemes of unfair personnel treatment?Also, on orientation with Ram (the one who answers emails) I added 2 more days for trekking route and then I had paid for a private car $65 in advance to go back to Kathmandu but the agency cancelled it just a few hours before the trip due to the \u201cfuel crisis\u201d. Instead I had to use local bus which was a highly unpleasant experience, believe me, and especially because I had to stay on the roof top and watch my bags. I was compensated for a private car lately in the office, but nobody picked me up from the bus stop.I would suggest to HSJ to invest into their personnel like language classes as well as equipment and a first aid kit, so they don\u2019t look discreditable in front of trekkers. I am not providing HSJ with my personal details as it is none of their business. I told at the end of my trip to Mr. Sapkota what I think about them, however, I was still pushed to write a 5 star review. And I am sure that every new review from now will include few words how professional those folks are.Well, Nepal is a beautiful place with lots of sites to see and exciting moments to experience. But do not deal with the agency! They will ruin your impressions of the country. Logistics was a disaster. Thus, what is the point to pay to the agency when you can arrange everything yourself for much less money and with a much better experience. Just take a satellite phone for emergency use and be ready to bargain in the lodges."

Having a tour guide in Nepal is quite useful, even if you love being on your own - public transport could be tricky and in the mountains you'd get better service everywhere. Our guide Ram was very knowledgeable and made sure we had a good time during the Annapurna Ghorepani-Poonhill trek in may 2016."

I soon felt that I was being pushed into more than I wanted, both financially and as to tone of the trip. I wanted a relaxed trip but one that would allow us to see a lot but also with the flexibility that would permit changes if needed. I also wanted my money to go into the hands of local Nepalese, not a distance agency. Himalayan Social Journey was just that. i suspect that their main business is with trekkers as that is what draws many to Nepal. However, as aging travelers, they were able to accommodate our needs as well. We worked out the basic itinerary and hotels that I suggested i advance so had the main features of our stay defined. However, modifications due to flight schedule changes and personal requests were quickly worked into the mix. We had a great driver , Dilip, with good vehicles for all our travels. That included driving for hours on the main, but very narrow congested roads. Fly when you can as the roads are really bad. Our guides in Kathmandu were very good. They were knowledgable, friendly, and very good about judging our interests and pace. The resort in Chitwan was first rate, The guide in Pokhara was young and somewhat shy about speaking English but was able to adequately show us the relatively few sights of interest in that city. I certainly would recommend this travel agency for somewhat independent travelers who feel they do not have to have their hands held throughout but still want the services of a competent team. Thanks Ram for being so flexible and for interpreting and handling our needs so well."

The agency promised point to point transit via deluxe tour coach but on our arrival in Kathmandu, the Managing Director Mr Ram Sapkota told us that he arranged local bus for us for one of the transits and encouraged us to pay US$75 to arrange a private van instead since deluxe bus is not available for whatever reasons. Mr Ram told us a local bus ride is an extremely uncomfortable ride and we may reach our destination late. To me, this is the agency's oversight but Mr Ram is insistent that we shld bear half the additional cost in a private van. This is almost like a blackmail to me in the first day of my Nepal trip and i offered to pay US$25 instead which he rejected. I had to give him a dressing down there and then. I told him that I was very upset cos of his service attitude, he had no intention of making good his agency's oversight and had the cheek to tell me to enjoy my local bus ride. I followed up by telling him that if I have to go to the local bus station and board a local bus in Nepal, why do I need to pay such exorbitant fees to book his agency for the land tour? There was little room for negotiation and Mr Ram just kept quiet. Eventually at the end of the 10 days Mr Ram compensated me and my friends for taking the local bus instead of the promised deluxe bus ride. But of cos i had to make my unhappiness very clear before he compensated me and my friends.One should be very careful dealing with Mr Ram Sapkota as additional costs might arise even if due to the tour agency's oversight. Or when he tries to suggest alternative lodging or tour itinerary, chances are it might be a rip off."

Staff greeted us warmly and looked after us from the very beginning. Everything was well planned and organised so there was no waiting. Our guide and porter were wonderful and very patient with us (up hill and down) we both agree that this was the most wonderful holiday we have had so far and highly recommend this trip/trek with Himalayan Social Journey. Thank you to all the staff for making this holiday long to be remembered."

This was our first visit to Nepal and our first trek and we did not know what to expect, our 14 day stay was highlighted by our 6 day trek doing the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek with Poon Hill at 3210m altitude.Our trek Tour Guide Binod was very helpful and knowledgeable throughout the whole trek, he made sure that everything was good in both our accommodation and food everyday. His porters not only carried our duffle bags but were around to ensure that we okay during our treks.At the end of each day Binod and his porters also assisted with our meals at each guesthouse. The views were fantastic along the trails and every trail revealed something different within the region.I was so impressed with Himalayan Social Journey team I am now planning my next trek to Everest Base Camp next year, just rounding up my team.Well done guys, happy to do it again.See you all soon"

I recently just returned from a once in a lifetime experience to Everest Base Camp with a group of friends with the amazing help of the Himalayan Social Journey company. We had originally had seen the offer in Groupon but had wanted a different length of time for our specific group. Throughout the process they had maintained excellent contact with our one friend that organized this adventure and kept us posted about what to pack and to expect. Mind you, as much advise anyone gives you I'm not sure how well it would prepare you for this kind of trip. We were met at the airport by the driver and guide for the trek all the way to Base Camp and back. They even went above and beyond because our group came at different times and still picked us all up at our requested time frames with no hassle. During the trek we were accompanied by Shankar, Tengee, and three porters. Shankar and Tengee were excellent from beginning to end. They ensured our safety throughout the trek. Shankar debriefed us on a daily basis on what to expect in the days ahead and gave us advise on how to ensure our success to base camp as a group. Not sure if we would have all made it to base camp without them. We had a great experience with this group, their hospitality in each of the tea houses as well made this adventure even more memorable. Serious props to all the porters out there because that is one hard job to do and they make it look easy! At the end of this trek they were no longer just dedicated, knowledgeable tour guides but also our friends. Highly recommend this company and these specific people mentioned in this review! Thank you again, Himalayan Social Journey."

So decided to do it with a group and these guys were suggested to us . The price was right , all inclusive trip , just had to pay the flight to Kathmandu. Was met in the airport by the driver , taken to the hotel (3 star - central , comfortable, not the ritz by any means but great for the job intended ). We met the company head and guide on arrival . The guide (Shankar) was a very chilled bloke , brought us to a place for food (national cuisine - great and very reasonable) and answered any queries we had before we left in the very early am to get trekking to base camp. This is not for the feint hearted , it's tough going , the guide (Shankar) has your lives in your hands at points along with his right hand me our Sherpa ( tenzee) and 3 porters . These guys were fantastic from beginning to end , they knew the lay of the land to perfection , were extremely knowledgeable regarding symptoms relating to altitude sickness ( I work in the medical profession myself) and just generally nice guys which is important giving what you're undertaking and how long you'll be with them. It was an amazing journey , I'd highly recommend it and the Himalayan social journey tour guys, noting particularly Shankar and Tenzee and the 3 porters ( the 3 lads were so efficient carrying our stuff ahead we barely saw them , they'd go as far as bring your bag into your room for you - serious service ). So if you do it go with these guys , and get the two boys on board Shankar and Tenzee thanks again guys good work !"

I used HSJ last year for an Annapurna trek and in both treks, HSJ did a good job in its organisation. This year, our guides Bishnu and Ganga, and our porters were all very good. In particular, I would also like to thank HSJ for ensuring that I caught my plane to Australia. I booked a single supplement and was reimbursed to a degree as the result of having to share a room on some nights. Originally the trek consisted on two groups due to the number of people, however, it became one group of 22. While we got along well, I believe it was too large. I think the ideal size is up to 10 or 12. Having said that, I'll continue to recommend HSJ to my friends."

There is nothing bad we could say about this trip or the people who organised it and those who made it happen for us. The highlight was the six day Annapurna Middle Circuit trek we undertook. At times it was physically challenging at our age but also made easy by the support of our guide Ram Chandra Dhauniya and our porters who we developed so much respect for including Subas and my little mate Ram Krishna who amazed me with his strength for someone so small. The guest houses were basic but adequate, sometimes the hot showers did not work but we happily survived. Our favourite was the Macha Puchhre Guest House where we had some or the best food we have ever had. The toasted sandwiches and spring rolls were the best ever.We were bless with magnificent weather for our trip up Poonhill and Gunning Hill as you can see by the photos.The trip was one of those life time opportunities where we saw and experienced so much and developed a deep respect for the Nepalese people.We got to experience so much in those six days and the memories will last a life time."

The 2 of them are one of the main reasons which make this trip an enjoyable and memorable one. They show sensitivity to our needs and constantly make sure that our safety and well-being are taken care of, especially when the weather gets tough. They also tried their best to arrange the best lodging and food for us. As a whole, they really make the journey as smooth for us as possible. For instance, during our stay in the Manakamana Valley Resort, we have to walk a long path (i.e., up and down many steps and across a bridge) to the place, Milan had to help us with our heavy suitcase. We really appreciated his help with this. One suggestion for improvement is to make the resort more accessible to the visitors as it is still a place to stay in.Overall, we definitely recommend HSJ to manage your nepal experience:)"

You all looked after us so well and made our visit to Nepal very special. HSJ also organised our nine day tour of India through Abyss Tours. Everything was organised exactly how we wanted it. Our private driver Jay was a fountain of knowledge and his driving was amazing. Our tour of the Golden Triangle, including Ranthambore National Park, was a wonderful experience. We even got to see a tiger! Private guides had been arranged for us for our tours of Jaipur and Agra. Ali and Raj were amazing and really knew their stuff!

This was the hardest thing I've ever done but I'm so glad I did it as the scenery was magnificent and spectacular, If you fancy visiting Nepal it is such a beautiful country and the people are lovely and they need tourists, there are easier treks and tours than the one we did but if we come back again we would definitely use Himalayan social journey and especially Ganga who couldn't have done any more for us.

Our experience was made most enjoyable and hassle free right from the beginning. Booking with Ram was an absolute pleasure, taking the time to answer directly any questions we had regarding the tour. We were greeted on arrival in Kathmandu by our guide Binod and what a bloke he was! From sight seeing in Kathmandu, Chitwan and Pokhara to trekking though the Himalaya's, Binod could not have been a lovelier, more accommodating guide. Large amounts of credit must also go to our porters Rupus and Godess (forgive our spelling if wrong!) who for our 6 Day Annapurna trek were nothing short of amazing, two lovely blokes that made the trek even more enjoyable, sharing a good sense of humour and imparting there local knowledge along the way.This really was a truly local Nepalese experience. Whilst the whole trip was well planned and catered for with comfortable accommodation, we never once felt like we were part of a large tour group. It felt more like Binod as our friend had decided to take us for an adventure, showing us his favourite parts of the country. Everything was personalised and special mention must go to Binod for catering the experience to our various needs and abilities. We couldn't recommend the trek with HSJ highly enough.

He is an amazing guide: knowledgeable, attentive, friendly, accommodating and fun.We knew what to expect from Nepal and HSJ - and neither disappointed. Do not come here expecting a 4 or 5 star hotel to be on a par with the West - unless you stay in the Hyatt or similar. 'Luxury' in Nepal does not have the same meaning but you will get a comfortable, clean room with ensuite facilities for around \u00a325-\u00a335 per room per night b&b. We stayed at the Holy Himalaya Hotel in Kathmandu before and after our trek (part of HSJ) and apart from a cold shower on the morning before we flew to Lukla we had no issues at all. The staff are lovely: special mention should go to the waiter Druber (not sure if that is spelled correctly!) who looked after us every time we sat in the lounge/bar area.I have written a separate review of the EBC trek and Nepal in general which I hope you will read and be inspired to visit this lovely country."

The guide and the porters were fantastic. Obliging, friendly and a great source of local knowledge. The accommodation, sometimes basic, was clean and comfortable on the trek. The scenery stunning ... so close to the ice capped mountains. The activities included in the trip were varied and well spread out. White water rafting was a hoot, and the Chitwan wildlife encounters ... crocodiles, deer, wild boar, birdlife, monkeys and the elephants were all memorable. The trekking is not for the faint hearted or unfit, but it is an experience not to be missed. The food on the trek was tasty and cheap. Pokhara was delightful. A contrast to bustling Kathmandu and easy to shop for gifts, with lakeside shops and restaurants. The boat ride on the lake was fun too. The road trip to Chitwan was long and dusty, but this will be less onerous when the road reconstruction is complete. The hotel accommodation in Kathmandu at the beginning and end of the trip, and in Chitwan and Pokhara were comfortable and safe and well located. The pool at th ened of the trek in Pokhara was very welcome. The company, Himalayan Social Journey, was very easy to communicate with prior to our trip, with all questions answered promptly, and very advantageous that they are local (owned and based in Kathmandu). We had a great time, and have special thanks for Ram our guide and Binod our porter for their hard work and friendship.

However the tour was as I expected, a little loose at times things were changed without consultation with the guests but I suspect that's the nature of things in Nepal. Chitwan National Park was terrific. We saw a rhino in the wild. I did not enjoy the elephant breeding centre or the elephant bathing which seemed a total tourist trap. The elephant safari was also a lot of fun and better than the one I went on in Thailand, however got to bath the elephant there so it balances out. The trek was the highlight for me. I loved the rhododendron forests and seeing the mountains. You need to be fit but not marathon fit to do this trek. The guides were very nice but did not offer any information at all. For example we drove past Buddhas birth place and were not told. We also had a day tour in Kathmandu and that guide was excellent. So again it's a little hit and miss but I loved it."

Overall 11/10 would definitely do it all over again! A big thank you to everyone who planned, organised, and put together this fantastic trip :)"

My fiance and I had the pleasure of completing the 14day everest base camp (ebc) trek from March 19th with two extra days at the completion of the trek spent at the Gokarna Forest Resort in Kathmandu. What can I say, the trek was absolutely spectacular. You could not find better guides (Ganga and Bishnu) for conditioning our entire group to the task, keeping us focused and maintaining a positive outlook at all times no matter what was happening. It was because of this fact that we had 100% success rate of all 19 persons on our trek making it the entire distance to ebc. We can not thank the team at Himalayan Social Journey enough (including the guides, the porters and also Ram coordinating everything) for their professionalism and for making our trek so effortless in terms of organisation. 10/10 for everything they did. They have made one of our bucket list dreams come true. Thank you guys (especially Ganga and Bishnu) we would love to come back again one day in future!"

My wife reluctantly agreed and planning begun. I can't say our pre-training was flawless, but I hoped it was enough.We encountered a magical land of beauty and light that we will never forget.Our guide, Mingmar, was remarkable as no matter what we needed or when, he was there for us. Along with his merry troop of porters, my daughter and I not only successfully made it to EBC but loved every minute of it (perhaps with the exception of 3 hours uphill to Namche on day 2, but Mingmar somehow managed to keep us smiling \"Nepalese flat\" \"slowly, slowly\" \"Zum,Zum\".I highly recommend Mingmar and HSJ as if they can get my daughter to enjoy an 8 hour trek, they can do just about anything."

Initially anxious about how our three kids 10yo, 13 yo and 16 yo would cope with trekking. But our fantastic guide Prakash (trained medical assistant too!) was incredibly organised (he said he was our father for the trek!) and supportive, setting a comfortable pace and our kids loved the trek. Didnt see mountains until the last two days due to mist, but the wait was worth it. Prakash picked great rooms to stay in overnight, and with our ever smiling porters Subus and Binod, we had many hours of fun card playing, even learning a great new game (Ben is the monkey!!)Side trips during this holiday were memorable: especially our great tour of Bhaktapur which HSJ organised on the spot to accommodate us - great flexibility. Amazing city. Friendly people. Other organised trip made especially memorable by the incredibly warm, knowledgable and smiling Busu, our Hindu devotee - whose many years of study of Buddhism and Hindu religions added great detail to what we saw. Can highly recommend all of these men who made our holiday with HSJ memorable for our entire family. We are all keen to be heading back again, it's just a matter of when....."

Cannot give enough praise to HSJ for taking the stress out of vacation planning. The company is very professional, organized and accommodating to your personal needs. We simply had the most incredible time!Our whole family enjoyed the trip. We travelled with our three children, ages 13, 11 and 7. HSJ was flexible with our itinerary and was great with suggesting activities we may enjoy. They took care of everything for us, from ensuring our family had hotel rooms next to each other, arranging transportation, booking activities, etc. They made sure we were comfortable, well-fed, safe and happy every step of the way. All we had to do was show up and enjoy!Special thanks to our guide, Raju. He was positive and full of energy each day. He provided great information, kept us on schedule, and was simply fantastic with our kids! He definitely went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful holiday.We must also thank our Kathmandu sightseeing guide, Basu. This man shared an amazing depth of knowledge with us as we toured the stupas and temples. He was patient and kind and took the time to answer our many questions. It was a special day that we will remember for a long time.Finally, thank you to Ram for overseeing our trip. And thank you to our drivers for keeping us safe and porters for carrying our bags on our trek.All of these people had a part in helping our trip flow seamlessly and without worry. They also provided us an insight to their country and culture that we would have missed had we travelled on our own.I won't detail everything here as it's too much, but we were able to experience so many things on this trip: sightseeing, cultural dinner shows, rafting, trekking, paragliding, zip lining, mountain flight, and more! Accommodations were clean and comfortable. We especially enjoyed the family feel of the tea houses we stayed at. Transportation was via a company-owned van, which was much more comfortable and safe for family travel than the tourist busses we saw. We opted for the drive back and forth to Pokhara instead of flying which allowed us to save some money for activities as well as enjoy the breathtaking scenery of the countryside and its villages. We had some incredible food while in Nepal and HSJ was even able to set up a cooking lesson for us at a restaurant in Thamel. We learned how to make momos and the national dish, daal bhat, a great experience for the whole family.Even though we did all of these things, it was really just scratching the surface! Nepal has so much to see and do. We're already talking about when we might be able to go back. And when we do return, we would not hesitate to book through HSJ again!"

Won't necessarily talk through step-by-step the inclusions to this tour, because they were extensive, but wanted to highlight the significant number of additional stops and extras that were organised as the opportunities arose by our guides. This made it for us. Had been concerned that the whole trip may have been a little inflexible but was constantly surprised. Kudos to great guides, Tanveer and Ibrahim, who couldn't have been more helpful. Budget three-star accommodation puts you in the thick of things which probably is the was India should be experienced by the first time Western visitor, while there was a five star option available if desired."

Ganga was very knowledgeable not only about our journey but also first aid. He continually checked on our well being and ensured we were feeling okay. He even brought us warm water at about 2am in the morning when we were not feeling great! We had a 100 percent success rate in making it to base camp which I thought was a highly commendable achievement. Ganga and Bishnu never lost their cool and always had a smile even on a few occasions when members of the group weren't feeling their best.Our accomodation at all the stops of a good standard and the food was really good with a lot of variety.I would highly recommend this trip to to those with a senese of adventure."

He arranged everything for us, all with a smile, nothing was too much trouble. He was a wealth of information on any subject we asked about.We met up with Binny 2, our Sherpa and our porters at Pokhara, once again they looked after our every need, always cheerful, often singing as we walked, they even tried to teach me some Nepalese. A highlight was playing cards with them at night as they taught us Nepalese card games.The canoe ride was a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu, our guide pointing out the lazy crocodiles along the river bank. We came very close to a rhino and her calf whilst sitting atop an elephant, she wasn\u2019t at all bothered by us, perhaps she could smell the elephant, and watching the elephants walking down the road after they finished work, whilst drinking a coffee at a caf\u00e9 was fabulous. We stayed at the Seven Star hotel in Chitwan which was lovely.On the trek, a day or so out of Pokhara, the haze cleared and the snow-capped mountains and red rhododendron trees appeared, they were stunning, making the walking up so worthwhile. HSJ had made a decision to break a long day in two and I was very happy with that decision as we had two fabulous days of walking instead of one very tiring one.One day along the trek while I had decided to walk alone, I went down the wrong path, but there was a porter who spotted me, guiding me back along the path \u2013 that could have been a long day! The slower members of our group always had a guide or porter with them should they need help.Accommodation was varied, from rooms with ensuites to shared facilities on the trek, but Binod always told us what to expect. Hotels in the towns and cities were good.I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Himalayan Social Journey for your next trip."

Other reviewers have told of the sites and sounds that the tour provides and I fully endorse what has been stated. Tanveer was a wonderful caring guide who \"went the extra mile\" to ensure that everyone saw and experienced everything possible but at the same time accommodating some group members inability to undertake certain activities.A few additional points not previously notedIndia have a regulation on how many Rupees you can bring INTO the country. Check with the Indian Govt. Website prior to leaving as the amount changes regularly (Anywhere between 0 and 25,000/-) Contrary to what is written obtaining cash is difficult. There are numerous ATM's, almost on every corner BUT they usually do not have any money to dispense. Changing money at hotels etc. gives a poor rate of exchange. Tanveer changed AUD. Probably the best way to travel is to be cashed up with AUD and change with the tour guide. (Avoid $100 bills as they are viewed as possible forgeries).Credit cards- Although hotels and restaurants display Visa/MasterCard signs on most occasions it is not available and the excuse is that the machine is broken. Pleading no cash is useless and you are directed to borrow from the tour guide or other travellers.Entrance fees amount to about $85AUD and then other optional activities approx. $120AUD.Remember tips.Bring lots of hand sanitiser, toilet paper, wipes etc.Water is readily available for purchase - usually about $0.60 per litre"

We recently travelled on the 13 day India's Rajasthan Revealed tour with Himalyan Social Journeys (Webjet Exclusives). What a fantastic tour with our professional, kind and organised tour guide Tanveer ensuring our tour through Rajasthan was a exciting adventure. Webjet Exclusives provided us with information on their website, via Chat and email. However, Abid, the manager of Himalyan Social Journeys gave us extensive information on the day to day itinerary, times for each location visited, the costs involved in entrance fees (to be paid daily), with suggested tips for the local tour guides, tour guide and the driver. Plus other information for our journey.Our jam packed tour enabled us to visit the various historical monuments, mosques, palaces and forts, market places etc in New Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Pushkar as listed in the itinerary on the Webjet Exclusive website. Our days were full but what wonderful sights, sounds and experiences. Our accommodation was the 3 star hotel option which were clean, tidy, comfortable (Jaipur had a roof top restaurant) and in the centre of the city near market places, restaurants nearby etc. We travelled each day in a comfortable, air conditioned 40 seater coach, with water available to buy each day. Breakfast was included in the tour package (cereal, juice, bananas or paw paw, toast, boiled or scrambled eggs, paratha, tea/coffee). Each day we stopped at clean restaurants for lunch and dinner with tasty, nourishing menus with a variety of options to eat - entrees, mains, snack food, Indian food or Chinese food. Go to the rooftop restaurant to look at the Fort in Pushkar. Be warned to have water handy to clean your teeth. Do not eat the fruit or salads, only bananas, mandarins or paw paw. Travelan tablets were helpful to us plus a few bottles of hand sanitiser, bacterial wipes and diarrhea medicine. Wear long pants, ladies suitable tops, carry a scarf plus wear closed in shoes as the streets in India are dirty with lots of rubbish in the streets. The abject poverty in some areas was a little confronting.I had trepidations about travelling to India but so glad I did. Get out of your comfort zone and experience this tour and Rajasthan. We highly recommend this tour and both Webjet Exclusives and Himalyan Social Journeys."

We had 2 guides with us all the time (both had excellent English) as well as local guides at each stop. The hotels were very good - the Clark's ones seem to be a very reliable brand, and the Crowne Plaza in Rohini, Delhi was excellent although a fair way out (but the metro was at its door step). The latter has just won the best restaurant in India! The tour was very thorough covering all the big ticket places we expected to see in the limited time (12 days) and we had plenty of time at each place. Thought had been given to visits eg being at the Taj Mahal early morning for good photo ops and reduced tourist numbers, as well as evening and early morning (boat) visits to the Ganges Ghats at Varanasi. Our guides, Akshay and Ibraheim worked non stop trying to fit in special requests from the group as well as caring for us to the nth degree on the trains, especially on the sleeper. The buses were clean and well air conditioned, and drivers very good. The airport transfers worked seamlessly. If this tour was an example of what Himalayan Social Journey provide, then I can recommend them unconditionally. Well done, guys!"

I would recommend these tours to all and in particular suggest the three star option because you get to stay in hotels reminiscent of the \"Marigold Hotel\", situated in the middle of the towns where all the local action is taking place. Having a regular supply of bottled water on the bus and bananas for snacks was a nice touch. Take an adapter for charging and we took a multiboard with surge control to increase our opportunity to charge all our cameras and tablets etc. a once. We were lucky there was only 20 people on the big bus which made it easier to get comfortable and get on with each other. We didn't see a tiger but that is the way of the jungle lol. We saw lots of deer, antelope, etc. and had some exciting rides on the roads of the national park."

Amazing sights, non stop adventure and colour. Mr Tanveer was able to be flexible with the itinerary and added some great extras in such as a cooking class in Pushkar, which was expensive but, well worth it. This was only possible because we had a small group of fantastic people. Be aware that if you take an upgrade you will be some way out of town and may miss out on great little restaurants and some fun times. Don't let the hotels sell you the buffet unless you are REALLY hungry and be aware there is a service charge and VAT on bills and 30% tax on alcohol. India is an assault on the senses and if you are a first timer to India, this is a great way to travel. Wonderful architecture which rivals just about everything I have seen in Europe. Don't forget your camera and plug for recharging."

Additionally, to be able to see the 3rd, 7th and 10th highest mountains in the world most days was both amazing and beautiful.Our guide Binni was exceptional, caring and thoughtful taking time to ensure we were all ok and safe at all times. We never felt rushed and were able to take in the beautiful scenery at every stop without feeling like we were slowing everyone down.We were told that this was a 'entry level' trek where in fact it was an intermediate trek, which we were not adequately prepared for. However, with the guidance and care of our guide we finished the 6 days full of energy and pride."

I could not express my journey through Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Varanasi better than Alan M's \"A journey through time\", appearing below. Please read his review. Be shocked, feel pity, be inspired and impressed and most of all be grateful.The Indian people working with tourists seem anxious for perfection! Often called upon to comment on \"how can I improve my services\". We did experience perfection at the Crown Plaza hotel we were privileged to stay in for a few nights at the beginning of our journey and also at the end. Other hotels we stayed in along the way were also very good to almost great.The hawkers hassled us into submission often, the guides were knowledgeable and helpful and the skilled driver of the bus was admired by each of our 14 party of Australians.I believe we all appreciated the energetic and enthusiastic help from our young \"caretaker\" who accompanied us throughout the journey and kept us all safe.Breathtaking architecture to hovels for homes, beautiful saris, starched white linen suits worn with waistcoats, colourful turbans and then jeans and gaudy colours combined to look wonderful.Rickshaw journeys - the incessant honking, the excitement of the close shaves, the fascinating sights changing every split second, (a cow resting inside a jewellery shop), cows everywhere, monkeys, camels, horses, donkeys, pigs, goats etc. etc. Who could sum up this experience?I must admit that I think India is confronting and perhaps not a suitable holiday destination for sensitive young people - sometimes too heartbreaking and certainly not clean, neat and tidy."

The first sighting of the Taj Mahal on a mist filled morning is emotional and breathtaking. An elephant ride to the hill fort in Jaipur is a step back to the heady days of the moguls. The pink city of Jaipur is unique and a visit to the sacred Ganges River at Varanasi to see the 24/7 cremations is surreal..Walk, travel by rickshaw bus and train.

Almost all trekking routes in Nepal are open, with very few affected by the earthquake.Then there are the people. Everyone we met was friendly and so helpful. The staff from HSJ, led by Ram, ensured that all happened smoothly. We didn't have to worry about anything; all was arranged and the drivers and guides knew exactly what our itinerary was to be. We especially need to thank Mr Prakash Rijal, our very professional trekking guide, and Pradip who never stopped smiling while carrying our pack. Also thanks to Dilip, who drove us to Bakhtapur and organised for us to meet an extraordinarily knowledgeable guide who added so much to our understanding of the area. We wish you all well as you work to rebuild your houses and villages.Nepal is certainly facing many challenges at the moment, but if you go with an open mind, are prepared to listen, look and learn, you will have an extraordinary experience."

With a big reduction in tourist numbers since the 2015 earthquake, we found we were the only 3 people on the tour.Prior to the tour we visited the HSJ offices, and Ram tailored the tour to better meet our needs.Bishnu Bhattarai was our guide, and Pradip Khadka was our porter.Bishnu has excellent knowledge of the tour, and was exceptional when it came to managing the trekking component. He knows loads of people along the trail, and was brilliant at helping us when the language barrier became too much.One person in our tour became sick and had to go to hospital in Pokhara. Bishnu problem-solved the whole thing and minimised the impact on the trek. Brilliant - a 5 star guide! The actual Trek was amazing, but is perhaps more difficult than the information would suggest. Best advice, train, train and train for the downhill steps (especially Ban Thanti to Tadapani). Our 15 year old son took it in his ample stride and loved the whole experience.The visit to Chitwan National Park was excellent, especially as we spied 5 Rhinos (two of which were babies!). Our guide in Chitwan was Narayan, who could see all manner of birds, and knew every one of them.The luxury wind down at Gokarna Forest Resort (our choice) was great. Staff are willing to help with everything, and the golf course is exceptional (as are the caddies).What would I do differently? - pay the US$100 to fly from Pokhara back to Kathmandu. With the fuel crisis in Nepal, the road trip is very slow and you waste a whole day on the bus.Otherwise, train for the walking, especially the downhill, and enjoy.It's a wonderful tour with awe inspiring views of the amazing Himalayas."

His local knowledge ensures that we get the best of everything available at every turn. For example, I needed to see a doctor and he arranged it whilst ensuring that the rest of my family could continue trekking. He then took me via an alternate route to meet up with my family and still experience the amazing Himalayas. Bishnu is lots of fun too, teaching us local card games in the evenings and sharing jokes with us and our lovey porter Pradip. The variety of places and experiences on this trip ensure that you get to experience the many faces of Nepal. Can't recommend HSJ and this trip more highly!

On the other hand, our trek was fantastic, our guide Mingmar sherpar and our porter umesh took us to off - the beaten trek places and gave us a glimpse into the sherpa local people ways of life. We felt we were very well looked after throughout the trek and through their encouragement, we somehow managed to make it to Base camp+Kala Pattar and back. I don't think we would have been able to done all of that without our guide and porter. The company itself values the customer's feedback and are quick to respond via email. when our flights got delayed for 1 day, the company were flexible enough to accommodate and we appreciate all the hard work they did to make sure we had an enjoyable trip. One bonus is their packages are also very good value for money and employ local staff like Mingmar so we know our money is going back to the local economy. I would highly recommend this company."

In particular we were often left unsure of exactly what we were about to see along the way, how long the journey would take to our next destination and when we woukd be stopping for lunch etc. We enjoyed a great selection of places of interest that included forts and palaces in New Delhi, Agra and the amazing cities of Jaipur and Varanasi, all of which on reflection were worth the many hours spent on the tour bus driving along bumpy and dusty roads. The overnight train journey from Agra to Varanasi was a challenge and I was grateful of the offer made by HSJ to do the return trip by plane. With the exception of our stay in Delhi, accommodation was not 5 star as advertised and mainly consisted of what I regarded as 3 or 3.5. Too much time was allocated to 'visiting' factories and workshops with the inevitable shopping outlet and an unspoken expectation or 'opportunity' to buy something. Time spent at these came at the expense of free time to wander around at our own leisure or to take a short rest! Having listed a number of negative comments I must add that our guides were, in the main, friendly, knowledgeable and great company and certainly added to the enjoyment of the trip.

And it is a good experience to learn something about Nepalese people while talking to him in the few days I was travelling with him.And special mention to Dilip my driver for Kathmandu and Nagarkot part of the trip, he is a very nice guy and cares a lot about my safety and comfort during driving, he warned me every time when the road was getting bumpy, and he kept me entertained during our trip to Nagarkot. And my guide on the first day to Kathmandu is also amazing, (I am sorry, I forgot his name), he is knowledgable with very good English, and he could tell me a bit more about political situation in Nepal which is very interesting to me. He is very helpful in all ways too, helping me to buy a SIM card and all.Despite the earthquake and the fuel crisis, the sights in Nepal are still worth seeing, and there is not much effect on tourists. Yes, some of the world heritage sites are partially damaged during the earthquake, and yes, sometimes there are power outages. However, it is still worth going, and your support to this country by going there is going to directly help the Nepalese people, as tourism is like the most important industry there."

The entire journey and logistics was almost flawless. accommodation and food at the hotels was of a good standard and value for money, other than the Clarks in Varanasi where the food was sub par. The days were quite long and exhausting, having traveled and taken in so much information at each site. We felt that after visiting so many amazing temples and forts, that by the time we reached Varanasi by overnight train we were rather tired and needed some rest. The temples etc in Varanasi were insignificant compared to what we had experienced in Dehli, Jaipur and Agra, and thought some down time would have been a better option. Walking the alleyways and Ghats within the Gangies and experiencing the ceremony that takes place each night was an unforgettable experience. The street food was also amazing, and being advised by the guides what was ok to eat and what was not. We were happy with the service and knowledge of most of the guides, particularly S.K in Jaipur, also Dada and Peakash in Varanasi who were both great guys who spoke very good English and showed us the real Varanasi (thank you) the bus driver and his assistant were very curtious And had thankfully ferried us around safely. Archie ?? The young man who accompanied us for most of the journey was quite attentive when called upon. However he did not follow up accommodation and transfer arrangements as promised for our onward journey. We were very grateful for Adib for pre booking and paying for ongoing flights to save us the hassle. All in all we were shown an amazing hassle free experience of northern India.

The trekking part is well managed with plenty of time for exploring the local villages, eating, drinking and enjoying the ambience of being within view of a 7000m mountain range. A really average level of fitness is required. If a soft bed is a necessity this is probably not the trip for you but the food everywhere was amazing, cold beer always available and the Nepalese are lovely people and very welcoming. Unfortunately we were not very lucky with the weather with a fair amount of cloud obscuring the mountain views, but when they peek out it is something to behold. Despite the fuel issues everything went smoothly and you can't help but feel for the Nepalese people who are doing it tough - especially heading into Winter."

I had three days of back-to-back engagements with Himalayan Social Journey while in Nepal, and will use this organization as my company of choice for travel in Nepal going forward. They were very reasonably priced ($30 for driving to 4 sites in Kathmandu, and $30 for a local one day trek) and they also provided airport drop-off service for a standard rate ($7 from Thamel) with a big, clean van and very safe driver. It's a no frills company, but I was charmed with the kind, helpful nature of the staff and how professional and trustworthy they are."

I did this trek early December and despite the fuel crisis at the time, the trip went without a hitch - the organisation was fantastic and the experience was culturally rich. We were privileged to be in the hands of such informative and professional people (Ram, Basu and Ganesh) who not only showed us the wonders of the Himalayas, but who educated us about the complexities of the political situation and life in Nepal. I also loved the yoga and meditation classes. The week of walking was wonderful and the pace was just right. I felt safe at all times and would highly recommend this trip. It was the best holiday I've ever had!"

There was no pressure to live up to an ideal way of trekking which was a great relief, I did it on my own terms and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The scenery was spectacular and the tea-houses clean and welcoming. They were quite simple but that was clearly explained in the beginning. We had wonderful support also from our young porter, Ganesh, who was energetic and positive the whole time. Nepal is obviously struggling from the after-affects of the earthquake and the territorial dispute with India resulting in fuel shortages, however, as tourists we were not affected unlike the Nepalese population. It's always difficult being in a position of privilege in a third world country, but that's why it's so important to go there and spend our tourist dollars, it's the best way to support their economy and keep people in work. My traveling companion fainted one day and the support was both instantaneous and caring and she received medical attention almost straight away. I felt totally safe in Nepal and if you want an experience that will put you in the present moment most of the time then I would encourage you to do a trek, I hardly thought about my life at home at all and after fourteen days I felt as though I had been away for five weeks."

The trip was well planned and organised by Ram and his team with some really nice personal touches like being greeted by our guide upon our early arrival in country and farewell at the airport. While we enjoyed many experiences including whitewater rafting and elephant ride, the highlight of the trip was definitely the trek itself. It was a bit difficult in parts, but as someone who had done very little physical preparation, I found that it was manageable and I was surprised at how little my legs ached! This was largely due to our tour guide managing an easy but steady pace to cater for our group of ten. The accommodation during the trek is fairly basic, but it was clean and warm despite temperatures dropping below zero a few nights. The food was better than expected, with pizza and pasta on the menu in most of the guesthouses where we stayed...I was really only expecting rice and curry. We were blessed with great visibility and the scenery was nothing short of spectacular. Our tour guide, Binod (Binny) was simply awesome - nothing was too much trouble for him. Our porters (Pim, Amrith, Krishna and Roupesz) were also fantastic, carrying our packs the whole way...and providing some great entertainment as well! I felt totally safe the whole time I was in Nepal. It is clear that the country is still struggling to get back on its feet from the earthquake and is dealing with the current fuel crisis, however the Nepalese people continue to take these issues in their stride with a smile on their face - they are such kind-hearted, beautiful people. I encourage anyone considering going to Nepal to just do it - the best way to support this country is through tourism. This was the first time I have been to Nepal, but certainly will not be the last!"

We decided on an itinerary prior to our arrival. It would be a 6 day/5 night tour in Kathmandu and Pokhara. Ram would also arrange to purchase our roundtrip airfare on Yeti Airlines to Pokhara. I arranged our hotels in Kathmandu and Pokhara.I understand that Nepal is going through hard times and some of the negativity is outside the company's control but some of it is entirely within their control. Being upfront and honest is the way to go.Arrival \u2013 in Kathmandu Airport, there is a person who is holding a Himalayan Social Journey sign. However, he does not work for the company. He only showed us the car not 5 steps away and asked for a tip.We were taken to the office to make payment for our tour \u2013 USD 125 per person for the tour and $240 per person for the roundtrip airfare on Yeti. Prior to leaving, I asked if credit card would be accepted. The answer was yes. What Ram failed to tell me was the 4% surcharge. That would be a helpful piece of information to have. On the day we flew to Pokhara, we were driven to the airport and dropped off. We walked into an empty building and was unsure where the airline check in was. We had to ask someone for help. It would have been helpful to have some guidance there. We are pretty self sufficient but that was still odd to us.In Pokhara, an additional person was added to our Private tour without comment or explanation. The 5 of us were in a tiny car. The \u201cguide\u201d we had in Pokhara was not a sightseeing guide. He was a trekker. He gave no explanations \u2013 just walked with us from place to place.Again, additional people were to be added to our Private tour in Kathmandu and it was only when I asked Ram about it, we were given the private tour. We paid for and arranged for a private tour. Everyone knows a group tour costs less. We understand there is a fuel shortage. Ask us. Do not just assume. Have things in writing \u2013 in email exchanges with Ram, the boat ride in Phewa Lake was included but the Pokhara guide stood there and argued with me. I asked him to call Ram and he did finally call to confirm it was included. He kept saying it was not expensive. That is not the point.In Kathmandu, they asked what time we wanted to start each day \u2013 really? They are the tour company. This is their business. I have never been to Nepal before. How do I know what the driving time is, how long one should spend, etc.Prior to arrival, we decided on sightseeing for 5 days but when we got there, everything was suddenly fluid and we only ended up with tours for 3 days with us having 2 days of nothing to do. We should have shortened our trip if this was the case.On the morning of departure, our hotel tried to call the office but no one answered and Ram\u2019s cell was out of service. Hindsight \u2013 I should have booked the Yeti Airlines ticket myself prior to the fuel crisis \u2013 would have saved some money prior to the price hike. Also, you can arrange for day tours with the help of the hotel once you are in Nepal.We have been to many countries (78 and counting) and joined many tours and this was probably one of the oddest tours we have taken. Bottom line is that communication is the key to a good tour."

It was a small group tour that took me to all the places I wanted to visit for a very reasonable price. Apart from breakfast, the cost did not include meals which, I think, is a good thing. I hate having to stop and eat just because it's on the program. I would rather eat simply and spend more time exploring. Also, I find that organised tours quite often take you to \"tourist restaurants\" where the fare is poor. The tour guides, generally, found restaurants to suit us and all but one was excellent and inexpensive. The accommodation was not luxurious but it was comfortable, clean and better than just adequate. The tour guides spoke excellent and clear English, were knowledgeable and flexible. We had some choice in what we wanted to do but the included experiences were great fun: a ride on an elephant, a row boat on the Ganges and an overnight train trip. There were also staff in the background organising and keeping us safe in a caring and unobtrusive way and attending to all those little requests. And, even before we arrived in India, emails were always answered and the agency was able to recommend and arrange for us to do other things if we were extending our stay. Everyone wants to do the Golden Triangle and see the Taj Mahal but Varanassi was, by far, the highlight for me. One can see why the Ganges River is holy and I am so glad it was included in this tour."

At 58 years old and being non Trekkers my friend saw an ad for a 16 day trek to base camp with Himalayan social journey( His Mum had done it 15 years before at 65 Couldn't be that hard!!), it seamed too cheap by far considering it included every small item inc a two day stay at the Hyatt regency to recover. I was sceptical as to how it would work on that budget. Firstly i was of the opinion that when the earthquakes occurrred after we booked that cutting off the Nepalise the oportunity to get get work was not going to help them recover so we would go as long as the tour company said yes. The two of us arrived nov 18th 2015 and it went like clockwork just as the Itinery said. Ram The owner was great and very accommodating. Our Guide Ganga Thapa was brilliant,a university graduate with over 45 base camp trips under his belt not to mention Mountaineering experience and the Anapurna circuit and others, his caring nature and willingness to point out flora and fauna made even me take notice . His sense of humour made the hills smaller. Their choice of accommodation was good value with quality higher than i was expecting. The porters that helped gave willingly of their time to make sure we were always fed and watered at mealtimes Bier and Roson are fondly remembered by us. All in all the trip was great, value for money was great and god knows how we got two nights of pure luxury at the Hyatt included in the deal beats me. Support Nepal, Trust HSJ go to EBC if we can do it so can you !"

Every part of my dealings with this company were first class and I would recommend them to everyone who wishes to trek in Nepal and anywhere else that HSC organise treks without hesitation.I booked this trek 18 months ago and the process was very straight forward. In the time between booking and commencing the trek, HSC kept in contact with me on a regular basis and this was highlighted when they were in regular contact during the terrible earthquakes and the aftermath keeping me fully updated about conditions.I arrived in Kathmandu on 2nd November, 2015 and through the chaos of Tribhuvan Int Airport, I was quickly able to identify the transport that HSC had sent for me and was soon on my way to their main offices. At their offices I met with Ram and Binod and I felt instantly at ease with the company and the arrangements for the trek.I was then conveyed to the hotel selected by HSC which was the excellently located Holy Himalaya in the Thamel District.Prior to the commencement of the trek HSC laid on a tour of the city and a welcome meal for the participants of the trek.Our trek commenced on Friday 6th November, 2015 with an early morning flight to Lukla which was thrilling in every way. We also met up with Binod again together with another guide Bishnu and a young assistant by the name of Kubir.The trek was fantastic in every way and was enhanced by the helpfulness of Binod, Bishnu and Kubir who could not do enough for us.The accommodation in the form of the The Tea Houses were basic but comfortable. There was good food served at all the tea houses. Most had showered although not all had hot water. All had at least one western style toilet and incredibly all had WiFi even the highest located tea house at Gorek Shep (5000m). You could even get a beer!The trek was marvellous. I had been informed by HSC that October and November were the best times to do this trek weatherise. We did not have one drop of rain and the day time temperatures reached 21/22c. It was cold at night but the tea house were generally well heated. The days treks are well planned as are the acclimatisation days at Namche Bazar and Dingboche.It was incredible to reach Everest Base Camp and also a fairly emotional experience.The highest point that I got to on the trek was Kalapatthar at 5544m. I recommend that if you do this trek and are able, that you make the effort to get to the top of this peak. It offers fantastic views of Everest - the best that you will see on the trek.At the conclusion of the trek we were flown back to Kathmandu and then conveyed to our hotel. We were also transported to the Airport by HSC at the end of the visit to Kathmandu.In conclusion, HSC made this such a special trip/trek. Their staff are friendly and hard working - nothing was too much for them. The trek was brilliantly organised. I only met Ram briefly. But I got to know Binod, Bishnu and Kubir fairly well on the trek and class them as friends.All the best for the future HSC and I will have no hesitation in booking another trek with you, hopefully in 2017."

First of all would like to point out to all those who are worried that Nepal is unsafe after last years earthquake may we recommend you put your worries aside. Yes there is some damage but Nepal and the Nepalese are absolutely wonderful; and not once did we feel unsafe. HSJ helped us plan and organize our trip. Their emails and communications were quick and helpful in the planning stages. They were ready to accommodate us and plan the trip to what we wanted not to some set standard. We ended up doing the Annapurna Circuit trek in Nepal for 11 nights. Our guide was Bishnu Bhattarai - the best treking guides we have ever had and we have done a lot of trekking. Bishnu was caring and fun. We recommend you get him to join you in a game or 2 of cards. The Annapurna Circuit was a beautiful trek. Some of the guest houses were OK and some were not so OK. Bishnu tried to find us the best ones in every place we stayed but you have to realize that sometimes it is what it is or that's what is available so live with it. In Tibet we were going to go treking as well, which HMJ had arranged, but at the last minute, when we were on the Annapurna Trek we decided it was going to be too cold - so without complaining about the last minute changes HMJ kindly helped us re-arrange our Tibet Trip to a driving / site seeing trip rather than a hiking to Everest Trip. Thank goodness because it was cold in Tibet. I cannot tell you how many times we asked HMJ to make changes (some small and some large) to our schedule while we were on the road. We have never had a more accommodating Tour Company than them. They never complained about our changes, always helped us and made good suggestions. Everyone from the drivers to the guides and the office personnel were helpful and friendly. Three last suggestions - if you are doing a city tour of Kathmandu through HMJ ask for Swami Basu dev as your tour guide, Very knowledgeable and interesting guide. Secondly, we would go back to Nepal and use HMJ in an instant. We do not ever need to go back to Tibet. The tour company was good but it was the actual country we did not like as much as Nepal. Lastly, Nepal has a lot to offer. We only saw a part of it. Take your time and enjoy the people and culture. You will not regret it."

We had a ball visiting some of India's iconic buildings and locations such as, the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Lotus Temple, the holy lake at Pushkar and many more. All the places and locations visited gave you feelings between stunning to fascinating. We were in Jaipur at the peak of the Indian celebration for 'Diwali'. During this celebration there are fireworks going off everywhere. We had dinner on the rooftop of or hotel (Ramada) and saw the city 'going off'. November is definitely a good time to be in India as it is the month of celebrations and weddings according to our bus driver 'Raju'. Speaking of our driver, he was excellent, spoke reasonable English and explained about what to expect at each location. Raju looked after us, on and off the bus. He told us when to be careful of pick-pockets, where not to go after dark, how to deal with the numerous beggars. He had good advice on eating from the street stalls and how to eat a large deep fried green chilli stuffed with potato masala - Yum ! Late one night, Raju walked us to our hotel, as he believed it was safer for us. All in all, this is a great experience if you enjoy eating different food, seeing a different culture (in the main a very friendly culture) and getting a little out of your comfort zone. Our tour only had 9 people and what a great group. Although we mainly stuck together when attending a site/location with a guide, people were happy to go off & do other things - no pressure. Thanks to this tour we have made some new and interesting friends and will try to catch-up with them for a re-union of sorts. Based on our experience on this trip, I would recommend this Rajasthan Revealed Tour by the Himalayan Social Journey group to any of my friends who wanted to get out and see a bit of India. We meet with Mr Abid ZARGAR the Director at the start and at the finish of the tour in Delhi. Mr ZARGAR took great intrest in how you found the tour and was looking for any advice in improving it which was great. His personal meeting with your before and after is such a change from sending off a Feedback Sheet to some unknown sometime later. Excellent stuff - Loved It !!!"

They picked us up from the airport, arranged all our extra tour events, and even picked us up from the airport between our domestic and international flights so we weren't stuck there - even though the tour finished several days before; they were also great re-organising our flights when one was cancelled - they made everything simple and easy. Communication was excellent. The trekking component was also fantastic - the guide was very experienced and friendly, and the porters were all lovely, they provided us with a great experience. I would travel with this company again when returning to Nepal."

We started with the city tour of Kathmandu with our very informative and captivating guide, Basu. We did the Poon Hill trek a year ago, including the city tour and were able to see for ourselves the affects of the earthquake. The vast majority of buildings were unscathed although some of the temples have been affected but are in the process of repair. Our guide for the trek was Bishnu Bhattarai, along with our two porters, Deepak and Mingma. The trek was tough going, walking between 4-8 hours each day but with the constant support and encouragement from these lovely 3 people, we got to EBC! Bishnu is very knowledgeable about all aspects of the Nepal and Himalayas, constantly offering information along the way, giving us many photo opportunities of the wonderful scenery, teaching us Nepalese words and numbers and keeping us entertained! Deepak and Mingma were both so caring and looked after us constantly. They truly were brilliant! The food along the way was tasty with a varied choice and the guesthouses were welcoming, most with fires in the evenings. Even though we completed the trek, we were unprepared for the freezing night time temperatures and lack of washing/shower facilities. In hindsight, we should have taken a -20 degrees sleeping bag and fewer changes of clothes! We would highly recommend HSJ."

Our guide, Ganga was so knowledgeable and answered every question we threw at him. From the different trees & plants and their uses, to the religious ceremonies taking place. Having him with us made us feel like we really got an insight into the wonderful culture of Nepal. Our porter Harry was so lovely and it was great to have him with us as well. We had another couple on our trek that were so lovely and easy to get along with, we were great friends by the end.The views, culture and people truly make this Nepal a remarkable place, somewhere I hope everyone has a chance to visit!"

I can't say enough good things about this company and its employees. We worked with them to coordinate a 45 day trip which consisted of trekking in Nepal and Tibet, complex travel logistics, several day tours and and ultimately - numerous on the fly changes to our itinerary during our trip. Simply put, they were awesome. Lets start with our trekking guide - Bishnu. For 11 days - he was our protector, our facilitator, our accommodater and our cheer leader. He assured our every need was looked after and never took anything for granted, constantly making sure we were comfortable and safe. He knew when to push us and when to lay off. He was so conscientious and encouraging. Of all the guided treks I have done, he ranks as the top guide. The porters were also awesome - always ready to lend a hand, make things a little easier or more comfortable. At night, we all enjoyed the company of each other playing cards and sharing funny moments. Bishnu and his crew were not only highly professional and competent, but truly beautiful caring people. I am proud to call them my friends.  The company espouses the same persona. Competent and caring, when we had travel hiccups due to weather related issues, they were there to adjust and readjust and arrange alternate transportation on a moments notice. When we decided to completely reorganize the Tibet portion of our trip with 2 days notice- they happily accommodated without penalizing us. The day tour of Kathmandu was absolutely amazing thanks to their tour guide - Swami Basu. I was astounded at his knowledge and insight and energized with the in depth discussions we had about the most significant part of this region's culture - religion and its relationship to every day life. I didn't want the day or the discussions to end. Bottom line is if you are looking for a tour company for this region (Nepal, India, Tibet, Bhutan), look no further. Whether its trekking or cultural you won't be disappointed. They are knoweldable, fair and caring and strive to please in every way possible."

We received high value and high quality travel services from start to finish. There is plenty of guidance material on the web for the preparation for this trek. My mistakes are worthy of note. Carry only 2 to 4 kgs with you and put about 10 kgs on the Yak or Sherpa to carry. I carried all sorts of communication, SAR and camera equipment including chargers and spare batteries etc. You need one camera that is specified to work in the cold \u2013 one of mine didn\u2019t. There are charging facilities, Wi-Fi and mobile coverage at many places on the trek. You need trekking poles. You need layers for the trip and you should not take a spare change of clothes for every day. Plan to buy just about everything at Kathmandu as the prices are unbelievably cheap and so cheap you can leave this with the people at Kathmandu after the trek. The Lukla airport arrival and departure is not as hazardous as advertised. Take Diamox two days prior to departure and carry anti-biotics, aspirin or Panadol and nausea medication. Go straight to Kathmandu and don\u2019t combine with another (business) trip as I did. I travelled from Australia to USA on a 35 hour flight then had four days of Jet-lag of two hours sleep a night and then 30 hours to Kathmandu. I took cold showers in sub-zero temperatures and all of this caused me to end up with Pneumonia and some altitude sickness at Namche. Himalayan Social Journey organised the helicopter evacuation and hospitalization for me. They even visited me in hospital in Kathmandu and provided surface transport right up until departure. They stay with you and provide whatever you need. Their porters are fantastic and help with cultural and practical requirements. I am planning to return to finish the trek in MAY/JUN16 and that will be with Himalayan Social Journey \u2013 Highly recommended."

First, the day after we had arrived, we had one day in Kathmandu sightseeing and we had a great city guide with us. We saw all the main attraction and he told us interesting stories but not too much. Then third day we were taken to Sundarijal from where we hiked to Chisapani, 12km uphill by stairs. It was rough but worth it because up there we could see the Himalayan mountains <3 We had our own mountain guide and porter with us. Our guide, Narendra, was amazing and so caring. The fourth day we hiked from Chisapani to Nagarkot, 24km nepali flat (meaning up and down but not as heavy uphill like it was the day before). Everything went well and nepali people everywhere were so nice and helpful. The fifth day we got back to the city and had special dinner with our mountain guide in Kathmandu. All these services was included in our package with hotels and breakfasts (in Chisapani it was a cottage/hostel, but very nice one in those conditions). And last but not least, we had an excellent driver in use during the whole time (also included in price). He picked us from the airport, take us around the city, drove us back and forth to the mountains and take us back to the airport too. In the traffic of Kathmandu, a good driver is a blessing and we had one!! Very good first trip to Nepal, can be recommended warmly :)"

Our wonderful guide, Ganga, and the 'supporters' that assisted our group on the trek (Binod, Ari, Subas, Ganesh and Bhupesh) were so attentive and helpful.Most of the areas we visited had either not been affected or had recovered from the devastating earthquakes earlier in the year, so I would encourage future visitors to Nepal to not be deterred by those events. I will be recommending this trip to all my family and friends.However, I must state that the words 'easy' and 'entry-level' don't accurately describe the six day trek in the Annapurna region - it was much harder than most of our group anticipated, so they weren't physically prepared for it. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the trip and the team from Himalayan Social Journey. "

We had been told that there have been a number of people who have been cancelling trips to Nepal due to safety concerns and potential problems encountered after the earthquake earlier in the year. We had no such problems and were well looked after by our guide Raju Guru and porter Amrid. My wife and I had not travelled in a number of years due to a couple of small people that have taken over our lives and it was wonderful to walk the earth again. Nepal was a great place to visit with the smells, the food, the chaos and of course the mountains. I would highly recommend it and Himalayan Social Journey to prospective travellers.Michael Hahn"

Nothing to spoil our holiday, there were lots of other options.

From a 69 and 75 year old perspective trekking in the Himalayan mountains does not have to be stressful for the person who with moderate fitness. We did no preparation but we do lead an active lifestyle and we chose the least extreme walk with the Himalayan Social Journey company. It was a 3/4 day walk going to 2200 mt - so not so high; but the views were still extraordinary. We saw 7 of the 8 highest mountains in the world. We took a mountain flight at dawn (which was truly amazing) flying from Kathmandu east to Everest - being very close on the turnaround at Mt Everest to the majesty of Everest and the other Mountains. But on our walk we saw the sunrise 3 times as it highlighted the snow topped mountains of the Annapurna range - each time we saw different perspectives of the mountains or mountains that were hidden behind other mountains so although we were not so high as to be concerned with altitude sickness we did appreciate the mountains in all their wild majestic beauty.Kathmandu has recovered from the earthquake surprisingly well. It has made a real effort to clear away debris and in the case of important monuments has done this carefully in order to be able to reconstruct them. Of course there are still people living in tents but it does all seem very ordered and orderly.We were not in the most effected areas. Apart from Kathmandu we were in areas that were lucky and but most people knew of someone who was effected by landslides or falling buildings. The main problem for the people at the moment is a lack of fuel for transport and cooking. The road to India is blocked and this is making life difficult with rationing and long cues for the fuel that they are able to get but the people are cheerful and strong in the face of adversity and they find ways to live with grace and humour and generosity. The hotels and the people are using wood fires to cook on and so the celebrations for Dashain, the major Hindu festival was still enjoyed. As we trekked through the villages the families were generous enough to include us in their festival with offers of tea and special treats that they had prepared. And we got to know just how far some of the younger folk had travelled to return for this important time. One young man came from UAR, he worked as a cook in resort out of Dubai and he was flying back in a couple of days - others were from closer in Nepal or in Malaysia.Nepal is not only mountains and monuments but also many rivers that are harnessed for hydroelectricity as well as white water rafting. We rafted on the Trishuli River on our way to Chitwan. It was fun but not dangerous as the company makes sure that experienced people are in charge. Chitwan is a special place; very different from the higher altitudes. It is the lowest altitude in Nepal and quite humid and the jungle has very different trees and animals. We did not see a tiger but did ride on an elephant and got very close to a rhino without bothering him, lots of deer and orchids too.On the last day of our trek a couple of us chose to paraglide down to the lake at Pokara. It was great fun.The guides were all very experienced and professional. Our first guide Ramchandra Dhounya was actually taking a group up to Poon Hill and we just tagged along for a few days doing the rafting and Chitwan area, he was very charming and personable as was his son. Our second guide, Bishna Prasad Bhattarai looked after us for longer and did a superb job finding accommodation in the simple mountain lodges that met our requirements in the difficult reality of very little fuel, certainly not luxurious but all with ensuite, and hot water, and good food as well as interesting people and scenery.Our porters, Krishna Pandey and Prakash Simkhoda, were also personable and helped make our memories enjoyable as they carried most of our belongings making our trek easier.Altogether the trip was something to remember.With the bonas of knowing that the company works to improve the social conditions in a sensible responsible way.Although we were an older couple I have confidence that any adult or any family with children could do a trek with this company. So discuss what level of trek would suit you needs."

The food and accomodation can be a tad repaticious but still healthy, warm and clean, but the big win was that our great guide Bishnu,his wife and our young Yak boy got all 9 of us safely to our amazing destination and back home again. Thanks again Ram for your professionalism and also your smiling friendship,2 perfect trips from 2 attempts, may have to try a third?"

Great flexibility (delayed the departure date, then extended the trip by a day), great communication, a great guide (Deepak) and porter (Anil), friendly drivers, guides and hotel staff in Kathmandu. Our guide was very informative, made us learn about the country and its people as well as some of the language. It was like being on a trip with friends! And we sure left as friends! We'll be booking our next Nepal trip with this great company again! Thanks a lot!!!"

My travelling companion and I also arrived 3 days early and were still picked up and looked after well before our tour group assembled. Truly fabulous trip! Our eternally patient and caring guide Binod - and his 2IC, also Binod - made the trip thoroughly enjoyable. Despite serious fuel shortages that were crippling this country, HSJ did their utmost to showcase this beautiful country and its people in a proud and favourable light. Binod even gave up part of his day off to arrange additional activities and spend more time with our group. Customer care and service like that is very rare. An absolute highlight was the impromptu entertainment provided by our porters and guides on my birthday: a cake was couriered in by motorbike, and after traditional English celebrations, our porters and guides sang and danced. I strongly recommend HSJ."

The organisation was exceptional, particularly during the middle of a fuel crisis. Our group consisted of my wife & I and a couple with their teenage girls from Perth. I cant speak highly enough about our guides. Bassu (? spelling) for the cultural tour of Kathmandu. Thank you. Ram our main guide. You really made this trek remarkable and Nabi who assisted Ram & carried gear for the girls. All of you made this a great trip. We began with some white water rafting (great fun) before a couple of days in Chitawan exploring the landscape and culture, then our trek really began. Lots of climbing and descending. Spectacular scenery, beautiful local people and culture. Food was amazing in the villages and the accommodation along the way was of good standard, clean and comfortable. One of the best curries we have ever tasted was on our last night out before finishing the trek. You definitely need to bring a camera or two. If trekking then a sturdy back pack for all your gear (even if you don't carry it yourself), a day pack for daily personal needs along the way, water bottle and good walking shoes or boots. Boots are better. Its worth contacting the team before leaving home to help decide what clothing is needed. We were in shorts and T shirts most of the time, but it got cold on Poon Hill. (2 degrees); though we live in the tropics so anything under 20 degrees is cold.Overall it was a magnificent experience, made special by our guides and the people we traveled with. In fact we are already planning a longer 3-4 week trek with Himalayan Social Journeys and Ram Chandra (our guide) for the 2017 season. We definitely will be returning to Nepal and would recommend this experience to everyone. If you do one thing this life then trek Nepal with Himalayan Social Journey. Thank you everyone for the experience and the friendship."

Beginning in Kathmandu then travelling to Pokhara for the trek, the organisation was excellent with reasonable hotels along the way. Our guide Binod was excellent in his leadership role but fantastic in coping with one member of the group who was self-serving, egocentric, bad mannered and elastic with the truth.The group excluding the previously mentioned person were a pleasure to travel with and this comes after many years experience in group travel. There was only a little evidence of the earthquake where we travelled and it is an interesting and safe place to travel in our experiences here over 33 years.In summary, a great place, a great company and a great guide Binod."

Included in the tour was white water rafting, jungle safari on elephants and canoeing, elephant bathing and a guided tour of Kathmandu. My whole family loved Nepal for its physical and cultural diversity. Most important was our guide Ram Chandra is an amazingly talented person who looked after us all like we were his family. Trust his knowledge and advice and you will have an incredible experience. The company was professional and flexible to our needs (when our luggage was delayed 2 days!). If you are considering travel to Nepal please be reassured the country is safe and fully operational for tourists. Holiday of a lifetime "

On the negative side, the white water rafting was a bit tame compared with what I did in New Zealand, but it was still enjoyable with a lovely setting, and my 14 year old son who had nothing to compare to enjoyed it. We did an optional Everest flight to view Mt Everest which didn't go as close as I expected and I felt it was a waste of money. On the positive side, the trip we did had a tremendous amount of variety, with accommodation varying from luxury to basic, good exposure to culture, as well as the natural attractions of Nepal. The trekking was more strenuous than expected. Unless you are accustomed to walking up and down hill(or you are young), it is challenging, but doable. There is never any rush so you can rest as much as you like. The optional paragliding in Pokhara is fun and worth doing. Everything was well organized by Himalayan Social Journey who were very flexible and provided an excellent guide named Narayan who was always cheerful and helpful. We didn't see much earthquake damage at all except for some of the old monuments in Kathmandu, and never at any time felt we were unsafe in Nepal. Overall the trip provided great exposure to a country and culture totally different to our own(Australia). The Nepalese people really need tourists to return to Nepal to help their economy so if you are thinking of going there then I would say do it."

We moved on to Jaipur, the pink city, and the magnificent City Palace and the Amir Fort. Then on to Agra and the wonderful Taj Mahal. From there we took an overnight train journey to Varanasi. Varanasi is an ancient city on the Ganges and I found it fascinating. We had an excellent driver who was with us for most of the trip. Not only was he a good driver but a complete gentleman. In each city we had a new guide and most were pleasant and informative. My recommendation would be to take the flights from Agra to Varanasi instead of the overnight train. But other than the one journey I enjoyed the whole trip."

We are just back from a 15 day trek and jungle safari with Himalayan Social Journey and I must say they bent over backwards to make sure we had a great and relaxing time, even while on the steep mountains. We were very lucky to have a small group (2 of us as a couple and 1 other man) and our guide Shankar and porter Pradip really added to the experience. Shankar always kept us informed and entertained while Pradip carried over 30 kilos around the Poonhill circuit with a smile on his face throughout. Even when I got a nasty stomach bug, Shankar got me a bed in one of the tea houses for an hour and was happy to delay our progress, luckily I managed to go on but they were true friends on the trip. They made sure we caught the train to Chitwan and even surprised us by meeting us back in Kathmandu at the end and insisting on carrying our bags. We were very lucky that it was so quiet but this was not good for Nepalese tourism. I would urge people to use this company and not be afraid of any safety issues. It is 100% safe, the weather was amazing (except at 3,200m, bring a jacket) and the whole experience was made super easy for us by this company. There are some super deals to be had right now and we will never forget our experience on the mountain or in Chitwan. Every Nepalese person we came across was full of smiles, a friendly 'namaste' and always had tea, beer or dal bhat/momos at the ready. Even with a fuel crisis and a problematic new constitution, we were never delayed or put out due to Shankar, Pradip and everyone at Social Journey's efforts to help us. Special mention to Dilap, our Kathmandu driver who managed to keep enough petrol to get us around the city and to and from the airport. Niall- Ireland"

We have done a lot of travel and often find unscrupulous tour companies but this one is first rate. Our entire journey was organised successfully by Ram and his staff. His trekking guides and porters know their stuff, are good at English and bent over backwards to help us. We are 53 year olds and they slowed the walking pace to suit our fitness. All levels are catered for. We did some training before leaving Melbourne which certainly helped but even if we didn't, HSJ would have catered for this also. We only did 3 days of trekking but we certainly could have done more or even less. Thank you Binot and Ganess for your wonderful guiding and caring. HSJ offered to tailor a trek just for us and we found them very honest and versatile enough to change plans at the drop of a hat. If there was one negative it is the hotels during the trek. They are all around two star and have problems with power, hot water, etc. However this was not enough to bother us and this is not HSJ's fault, it's just the way things are in the Himalayas. Our Kathmandu tour guide Basu was both funny and knowledgable and our driver Dilip was very experienced. Thanks Ram for all your organisation.

From the moment we arrived to the final drop off to the airport we were looked after fully. Our trip involved a great tour of Kathmandu, rafting, journey to Pokhara, trekking in Annapurna, elephant safari in Chitwan and Everest Mountain flight. Our guide Binod took great care of us, our porters were fabulous and we had a wonderful time.Ram ensured that we had the holiday we had wanted, nothing seemed too much trouble, thank you.Please note that everything is fine for trekking in Annapurna, visiting Kathmandu and Chitwan etc, we were totally unaffected by the earthquakes."

I would highly recommend this company to anyone wanting to do a well organised, safe trek with fantastic staff who will go out of their way to tailor make any of their arrangements to suit their clients.My 18 year old son and 20 year old daughter and myself (56 and female!) did the 15 day Everest Base Camp Trek with breakfast on 21st August in spite of friends and husband's concerns re earhquake and monsoon. We had a fabulous time and would encourage anyone to book and go now. Nepal needs tourism and the wonderful spirit of the Nepalese people in spite of their terrible experiences made us so glad to be there. Apparently so many people are cancelling or postponing their trips but we would say go now and enjoy the experience of a lifetime!The itinerary was very well planned and efficiently executed starting with our airport pickup and welcome at the Himalayan Social Journey office. We enjoyed the sightseeing of Kathmandu and our guide was amazing at answering our barrage of questions regarding culture, history, religion and obviously the impact of the earthquake. Some of the oldest buildings have been badly damaged and a few totally demolished but repairs are well under way and tourists should not be put off visiting.Traffic in Kathmandu is another amazing experience. All of the drivers that we had in the comfortable and air conditioned vehicles made us feel very safe in a system totally different to the UK! They were also very helpful and friendly and able to answer questions when there was no guide eg on the airport trips and to and from the extra white water rafting trip that we had booked.The hotel Holy Himalaya, Kathmandu, was a joy--brilliant location, comfortable and clean rooms, with hot water and flushing toilets (most appreciated on our return form the trek!) and very good food. And of course lovely staffWe felt so lucky to have Bisnu as our wonderful trek guide, and Tembe,our amazing porter. Bisnu knew everything about everything and has 25 years experience of trekking so we were completely confident putting ourselves in his hands. Some of the days were more challenging than others but as we were only a group of 3 we were able to go at our own pace and Bisnu even altered the destination on our returning days as we were going faster than he had anticipated (not so on the way up!)We achieved Everest Base Camp on the only afternoon that it rained on us, followed by snow overnight! The weather was otherwise fantastic, especially as it was the rainy season, and we awoke daily to blue sky and fabulous views, the clouds developing by the afternoon and the rain starting after our arrival at the guest houses. The evenings were cold and we were glad of our ski jackets in spite of the wood burning stoves in most of the guest houses.We took sleeping bag liners and although our porter carried sleeping bags for us we only needed them one night and felt that it was an unnecessary waste of our limited luggage allowance. Toilet paper however was in short supply and relatively expensive en route so take plenty! Also take chargers and adaptors as you can use them in most places. Head torches are essential for the guest houses that had outside toilets!The quality of the guest houses on the trek varied from excellent at Namche Bazaar to basic at Phakding and Pangboche, which was more what I expected. But the hospitality everywhere was wonderful.We would also highly recommend our Bhote Khoshe white water rafting experience. The rafting was good fun and the lunch provided was really tasty. The whole relaxed atmosphere at the camp base made us want to stay there for much longer. So do go. Book through Himalayan Social Journey. You will not regret it."

Nepal is as safe as any other place in the world and there is nothing to be afraid of. Well, maybe just one thing - that you don't have enough time to experience everything that this beautiful country and its amazing people have to offer. In our 10 day trip with the Himalayan Social Journey we got to see most of the main sights in Nepal and do a lot of fun things (rafting, elephant bath,canoying trip, cultural dances, jungle walk, elephant ride, trekking and paragliding!!!). Throughout our trip the HSJ family was very professional and caring. Everything was organised perfectly from the minute we arrived to the airport until the moment we left. All of us in our group would especially like to thank our guide Raju who took such good care of us and made our time in Nepal unforgettable. Until we meet again - Namaste!"

The areas we visited included downtown Kathmandu; Pokhara for a four day trek to Dhampus, Australian Camp and Sarangkot; Chitwan National Park and Nagarkot.During this time we were guided by Binod (Binnie) Dhakal. Binnie is an exceptional young man, passionate about his country and job. He gave an extremely informative and detailed account about the places we visited. He was most considerate of our older age and accommodated all our requests with enthusiasm and professionalism.Whilst on a four day trek of a short section of the Annapurna Circuit, Krishna ? was our porter. Krishna was an extremely capable and caring person. Sirma, the local guide, was terrific too. He was extremely informative about the four places that we visited included the Monkey Temple, Pashupatinath Temple, Boudhanath and Pantan Durbar Square.Dilip Simkhada, our driver to Nagarkot was an outstanding driver, negotiating windy roads to the mountainside town with caution and precision. Ram, the Office Manger was brilliant in promptly answering our many questions prior to arrival. The company was very accommodating to our change in travel plans to add Chitwan and Nagarkot to our itinerary after arriving in Kathmandu. Overall, it was an excellent holiday in which we learnt an extraordinary amount about Nepal. Whilst the damage of the April 25th earthquake is very much evident to dwellings around Thamel, Gorkha and Kodari, it is a safe place to travel with so much still to view. The resilience of the Nepalese people is extraordinary. We will encourage our friends and colleagues to utilise this company when visiting Nepal."

We were worried our tour were cancelled for that reason and contacted Himalayan Social, they assured us the tour was possible and they were happy to take us. As we arrived in Kathmandu we were informed that unfortunately every other person in the tour had cancelled and we would be going alone with our guide and porter. When we arrived in Lukla, our guide Bishnu and our porter Lakpa were already waiting for us and happy so meet us. The trek was sensational, Bishnu is a very knowledgable guide with 24 years + experience. Lakpa was also terrific, always taking the lead in the group. Hotels in Kathmandu were really good, well located in Thamel tourist area. The Hyatt nights included in our package were very relaxing.After our trek to Everest Basecamp, we book a trip to Chitwan and Pokhara which was not so good, and this is the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5. First the company insisted that we took the rafting activity which I am not a fan of, so we refused. I think it was a great decision, as when we travelled to join the group that did the rafting, we discovered this very polluted river that you wouldn't dare getting anywhere near. The trip to Chitwan by car was very long, as the roads are terrible around Nepal. Chitwan in May/June is terribly hot, and the abuse of elephants is present in every corner. The hotel \"Green Park Chitwan\" was very nice, but not all hotels offered have the same standards.Pokhara is a nice city, and we stayed in a nice hotel\"Mount Kailash\", although it was also very very hot. Had I known I would have changed this trip for a Tibet excursion instead. In general, Himalaya Social staff was very kind and helpful and accommodated to our needs. I do recommend any of their Everest Basecamp tours"

I was there during the quake, in Dingbouche village (2 days trekking from EBC) which was relatively unscathed thank god, but besides the worry of the quake, we were well looked after. The track is still passable. I was jealous this week to see our guide make it to EBC. We never made it to EBC, but did get one day away. Amazing experience, very comfortable accommodation (basic but comfortable), very attentive guides and porters. I was suffering altitude sickness and Bishnu constantly monitored everyone's condition. This is a great local run business and the guides and porters are worth their weight in gold. I booked and paid direct with HSJ and had no issues at all. I always received responses back on any questions very promptly. Also if looking for a good insurance company who covered up to 6000 metres for evacuation I can highly recommend World Nomads. After the quake I received 2 messages from them to guide me and provide information on what we needed to do if requiring additional accommodation, flights etc, very good service. To sum up, I would definitely go with HSJ again and recommend to my friends and if I had the time would return to do the EBC trek tomorrow. I hear there's plenty of people still going, and in fact as we were returning, we passed plenty of people still going up the mountain."

Throughout the 14 days stay 'locals' constantly thanks us for coming and expressed the wish that other tourists would soon follow. Upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport, our main guide Binod and a driver from Himalayan Social Journey were waiting to take us to a briefing and our first nights hotel. My bags with trekking gear somehow missed the flight and we had to wait 24 hours for luggage to arrive. Ram from HSJ changed our itinerary so that nothing from the arranged tour would be missed. First night was in a reasonably comfortable hotel in Kathmandu before a flight to Pokhara and a night in a very comfortable resort. The next 6 days were spent trekking through the Annapurna foothills. Lovely scenery, basic accommodation and a few challenging hills. Highlights included amazing mountains in the background, a visit to hot springs for an early morning relax, and not forgetting Pradeep our porter. Back to Pokhara for sightseeing, relaxation and a little shopping. Next stop Chitwan where we stayed at a resort named Hotel Seven Star. Great staff, food and pool. Activities included elephant trek; canoe down river with crocs; walk through forest being the home of rhinos, tigers, bears and lots of other wild and wonderful animals. From Chitwan we headed back to Kathmandu by road with a break mid way for white water rafting and lunch. It's a long drive (about 7 hours). Very slow! Until our return to a Kathmandu for the final 2 nights, we were fortunate to have Binod as our guide and organiser. Binod's constant attention, his knowledge of the trekking area and Chitwan, greatly added to our memorable experience.Finally, HSJ arranged a tour of Kathmandu cultural sites with guide Basu. Basu is a great communicator/story teller whose commentary gave a valuable insight into the history, development and religions of Kathmandu. We saw devastation in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, thousands living under tarpaulins, early reclamation and reconstruction, and a community wanting to get back to business. As tourists we were 'not in the way'. We have come away with the belief that much of the country is ready and waiting for tourism. Particularly trekking areas and cities to the west which are geologically more stable. Keep Nepal on the must see list!"

HSJ responded to each email very quickly, often on the same day. This gave me a level of confidence in the company which was subsequently confirmed on the actual trek. My brother and I were part of a small group (6 people) that did the 7-day Poon Hill trek. We had no problems with being picked up at the airport, despite me arriving a few days early and my brother on the allocated date. Ram, the manager, met us the day before the trek to finalise requirements and to formally introduce our guide Binod (Binny) Dhakal (who we had actually met at the airport). Binney and our three porters, Akkal Thapa, Santosh Dhakal and Krishna Timalshina, provided excellent service to us. Binny is very good, and I think the company should consider him for a managerial role in the company. The level of commitment to us by them was extraordinary when you consider that when the 25 April earthquake occurred (within the first hour or so of the trek), and they became aware that Binney's parents had lost their home and that Akkal and Krishna's homes were destroyed - none knew whether their families had survived. Santosh (single) also lost his house. They refused to call off the trek, saying we were their guests. There is no higher level of commitment to a client that I can think of. They were, naturally, extremely worried, however, once word came through (a couple of days later) that their families were save, they relaxed much more. Still, extremely difficult in the circumstances.The guesthouses we stayed at were pretty average, however, appeared better than others available in each village. It must be remembered that the trek goes through rural villages, so saying 'average' shouldn't be taken as a negative. I believe we got the best available. In any event, it all adds to the adventure. The food at each of the guesthouses, whether where we stayed or along the way, was good. Drinkable water is available at all guesthouses, which are no more than 30-60 minutes apart.We also went to Chitwan with no issues. We told Binny not to come with us so he could go back to his family. He made all arrangements for us and everything went extremely well.We found Himalaya Social Journey to be very competitive in its prices. I thoroughly recommend this company to anyone going on a Nepali trek."

He went out of his way to make our entire group not only feel safe, but be safe. Day 4: he ran from Tengboche to Deboche and back again to confirm that our hotel was safe. He kept our team intact, the porters were understandably concerned about their own family and homes, yet they put our interests first. Ganga also mentored our assistant guide, Bir, who markedly gained self-confidence and knowledge as each day went by. Ganga and Bir, gave us 5 star treatment the entire time, even though the facilities are modest (I really don't want or expect the facilities to be any different). In summary, we achieved what we set out to do, all on schedule despite the challenges that might have been with flights, accommodation etc. Ram runs a very professional company - proof that even in an earthquake he had fully functioning services and connections to all the supporting services, pick-ups, hotels, insurance companies etc. While the Himalayas are magnificent, the stand-out highlight of Nepal for me was the team of people in Himalayan Social Journey that we had the pleasure and fun to be with."

Started in Kathmandu with a tour of the City; collected by private car and guide arrived nice and early for an informative day around the major site seeing attractions.Off to Chitwan for Jungle Safari, Elephant-back Safari, Canoe down the river, bird watching, and a peaceful resort. Madan, the local guide was amazing; very knowledgeable and receptive to the many many questions.From Chitwan to Pokhara to start trekking; this is when Shankar our guide really came in to his own - excellent guide, willing to learn, happy to help, and just an all round great guy. He was teamed up with Dharma, the inspirational 50year old porter, that could burst a move uphill when he wanted.Amazing 6 days trekking; food was great, accommodation comfortable, views amazing, birdlife fantastic, company great, and the fact it was just the girlfriend and I with the guide and porter made the trip very flexible and convenient. Had a wonderful time. Make sure you ask for Shankar as a guide if you head over - he truly is a great guy!Had a wee look around Pokhara before heading back to Kathmandu. En route we stopped for white water rafting. This is where we hit only one of two minor glitches of the holiday. We were told that transport was included but were asked to pay $50 for private transport to and from rafting, or take public bus with all baggage (that was not advised) so we just paid the money; Rameshwar the manager made the decision for this and we were sure to voice our displeasure over it. I advise double checking for hidden costs with this man.Back to Kathmandu, and to be honest, one day was enough. Having been in peace and quiet (and cleanliness) of Annapurna range, the city was a little overwhelming - I would advise Kathmandu for a day and no longer - use it as a stopover point. Once you've had one day/night of it - consider it done!I mentioned two downsides to the trip; don't eat the meat served. We're Westerners and not ready for that kind of gut challenge - you've been warned. I thought I had an iron stomach...it took me 5 days of antibiotics to get over that one. Not nice!!All in all, 95% fantastic trip and experience. The guides, the private cars to and from site seeing, airport pickup and drop off, safari, animals (crocs, boar and sika deer), rafting, and trekking, all amazing. Try to forget the wee bumps on the way and it was well worth the money we paid - we were a groupon special (\u00a3500). Wouldn't like to pay anymore as everything is so cheap; rooms around \u00a31-5/night on the trek and food between \u00a33-7 per day, so don't spend too much. But do have a guide, otherwise you'll be pestered at every stop.Pleased we've done it. May be back, but only to where we know; miss Kathmandu, hit Chitwan, go more adventurous on the trek (base camp perhaps) and a night in Pokhara before the airport."

The managing Director Ram met us at the hotel on arrival and the excellent service just continued from that point. Sight seeing around Kathmandu by local guide Basu was an educational marvel. The trek guide Sherpa Mingmar and porter Umess perhaps arguably were the best to have on any trek and cannot thank them enough for providing excellent service throughout the journey and their friendship will be a lasting memory. We experienced nearly every weather condition you can imagine and we accepted what mother nature threw at us. Luckily we were prepared clothing wise for all weather which constantly changed throughout each day. The lodges and meals along the way were of a high standard letting us experience the local foods and hospitality. A few of out group experienced a touch of altitude sickness but Mingmar Sherpa kept a constant eye and monitored everyone's condition. A great trek for anyone wishing adventure and challenges as it remains a lasting memory for me.Thankyou Mingmar Sherpa, Umess and Ram and team at Himalayan Social Journey."

The care that Ganga, Binod and the porters showed me was truly exceptional. This is a very professionally run orgamisation but has a family feeling about it. I would recommend this company and in particular Ganga, Binod and Bishnu to anyone wanting a hassle free trek. I had the best time with a great group of fellow trekkers and will definitely be back."

            "review": "Everest Base Camp: Once in a lifetime experience!. We liked the idea that going through a local company rather than a big corporate may benefit the local people more but were apprehensive as to how we would go with the booking process. Any concerns we had were quickly dispelled with the ease at which the arrangements were made through email. The staff at HSJ were very prompt at replying to all the emails I sent and any final clarification was easily done over the phone. So confident did we become of the booking process that we even asked them to organise a Bhutan trip to start after our Everest Base Camp trek. This again was organised with the utmost ease. In Nepal we did the 16 Day Everest Base Camp trek package. Transfers from Kathmandu airport were smooth but when we got dropped off at the hotel we were not given any information on the orientation meeting. This was easily clarified by a phone call placed by the friendly hotel staff to the agency but this would be one of the rare occasions HSJ could have improved on its communication. Our guide for the trek was Bishnu and we could not have asked for a better guide! From negotiating the mayhem that is the domestic airport to making sure all our needs and whims during the trek were attended to, Bishnu and his team of Sherpas and porters were beyond exemplary. A few examples of their good work that jump to mind:1. Always being patient in managing the different personalities in our 9 person group. 2. Carrying the day packs of some members of our group when they were struggling with illness and the more challenging days of the trek. 3. On the day we had planned to hike to Everest Base Camp (EBC), it started snowing. There was a very real chance we were not able to make it to EBC after all the hard trekking we had done and the group felt shattered. Bishnu enlisted the help of 2 of our porters to help guide us to EBC in the snow and make our dreams come true. We actually had to descend in the dark but I felt perfectly safe knowing Bishnu and his team were guiding us. The porters actually carried the daypacks and held the hands of some members the whole way down and in some tricky spots would be running back and forth to guide more members. This ended up being a 12 hour day for his team and the easy option for him would have been to simply say to us that the weather was not conducive to the trek but he made sure all of us made it to EBC and made it back safely. 4. We were stranded in Lukla as the weather was not permitting our flights back to Kathmandu. When Bishnu realised we were due to fly out to Bhutan the next morning he did everything in his power to ensure we got on the earliest flight out of Lukla the next day so we could make our Bhutan connection. Short of being able to control the weather, he could not have done anything more!These were just a few examples and there are plenty more. The only criticism I have of the trek was the accommodation we stayed in near EBC: in particular Tengbouche/ Dabouche, Labouche and Pheriche. The state/ ratio of the toilets in those accommodation was appalling even by Nepalese standards. EBC trek is definitely not for the faint-hearted. You are pushed to your limits physically and mentally, then asked to do more the next day. But along the way you will discover your inner strength and resilience and share a life-changing experience with new friends who you seem to have known forever after just 2 weeks. And with Bishnu and his team, you can be certain you will be well looked after every step and Diamox tablet of the way!"

He knew his stuff, took care of us in slippery footing, and ensured our safety all the way. He was also Master of Ceremonies after dinner with his magic Card tricks! He's worthy of Las Vegas! He has done Annapurna Base Camp and Everest Base Camp so was full of interesting stories. He also helped us get the last equipment needed for the trek. Get this man to take you! He organised any changes we needed...Mobile coverage in Nepal is to be seen to be believed!For those thinking of doing this, please consider buying the majority of your gear there in country, Pokhara had many shops with all the gear and they are much cheaper than Oz. For people who are doing this only occasionally, it's a cheaper option and is good for the Nepali business economy.We had a full cultural tour with Basu, who took us to the World Heritage Stupas. He was a spiritual man, and we also had the opportunity to buy beautiful objects and visit Thanka art studios where they make beautiful Mandelas. Basu, I went back after our trek and bought a beautiful singing bowl from the Old Tibetan Singing Bowl Shop, where he showed us all about them. I wanted to tell you that when we were at Swayambhunath I noticed the chiselled lines on the paving stones were there to stop us slipping, but it seemed they became lines of script at times, and I thought it right to walk to a place of worship on the prayers and hopes of the faithful.Our accommodation was great. Hotel Tibet, a quiet haven, Mount Kailash in Pokhara lovely, and Hyatt Regency wonderful to end on. For Dhampus, Australian Camp, and Sarankot, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of accommodation, having expected trekking conditions to be a bit harder. Have to say all those mountain ladies can COOK! Drinks are available readily if you want that sort of thing. But the FOOD! We ate our way round the Annapurna foothills! They provided a wide variety of all nationalities, which was amazing.Did the Paragliding with Sarankot Paragliding. Prem, pilot extrordinaire, took an old lady from 1800 metres and it was something else! Rockstar Prem!Ram Parshad Sapkota came personally to give us a briefing, Thank you Ram Rameshwar, the manager answered every email promptly. Namaste Rameshwar! Baburam, our porter was awesome. He's a young man who helped us with cheer. And finally, but not least, our company driver 'D'. Anyone who's been in Khatmandu traffic, will know whereof I speak. Nepali drivers are AWESOME! \"D\", thanks. You took us all over and I could have watched the traffic for ages, what a sight! You guys know how to MERGE!Perhaps the weather was not conducive to seeing the mountains in their entirety, but they appeared as if by magic from the clouds and were amazing. It didn't matter, they are still so beautiful. Some places in the world are Spirit Country, and this is one.Recommend it!? Sure can! Just once at least!"

From the moment we arrived at the airport till our departure, HSJ were there to ensure that everything ran smoothly and that it did. Nothing was too much trouble for our guide Shankar from arranging domestic flights, trying to find my boyfriends lost e-cig that he left in a taxi, making sure we were fed and watered on the trek and carrying my day bag under his waterproof when it was raining as I had no cover. The porters do an amazing job too carrying our trekking luggage with them up and down a million steps!! The lodges we stayed in on the trek gave some amazing views (when there was no cloud) and the food was great and reasonably priced. All the hotels were lovely. Chitwan and rafting was my favourite. The only criticism would be that because I I like my own space sometimes I would have liked just to take my time eg at the hot springs I felt we could have gone there on our own so we could leave when we were ready. If I ever go again it will be with HSJ."

I've just finished a three week trip to Nepal which included a seven day trek through the Annapurna foothills organised by Himalayan Social Journey. Brilliant! I'm 58 and reasonably fit but it was quite a challenge at times, though always worth it. Ram (director of the company) and Binod (dear Binny - our guide) and ALL the porters were so helpful, kind, considerate, knowledgeable (when language would allow) and fun - when music was involved. If there was a particularly hard part, maybe with a little too many steps, there was always an amazing view to reward, or a waterfall around the next corner or a wild flower we hadn't seen before, another steep hillside with so very many rhododendrons that its breath taking or of course a snow covered mountain within reach .. almost. I've fallen in love with Nepal, it's kind sweet natured people, its art and craft, subsistence agriculture and paddock to plate cuisine (gotta love dal baht!!). Thanks to Ram and his drivers, guides and porters - it was made easier to do. I'd recommend this trip to folk who are fit but also recommend you research so that you find out the details like: it's steep, challenging, not luxurious and it's just the best possible 'holiday' to have. Thanks again Ram for your extraordinary organisational skills (which match this extraordinary country) and to Binny our guide. much love - from Australia."

            "review": "Unexpected end to trek. I reckon it's time I gave Himalayan Social Journey the huge pat on the back it deserves for looking after me during my Ghorepani-Poon Hill trek in February, especially to the managing director, Ram Sapkota, my guide on the trek, Dhakal Binod, and the unnamed helicopter pilot with the Internet handle \"Vertical Freedom\".Helicopter pilot? Oh yeah - I had to be evacuated from Chuile near Tadipani on Day 4 of the trek after I slipped on some black ice and broke my ankle.The fall actually took place the previous day, a few hours after leaving Ghorepani, but I thought it was \"just\" a sprain and limped on to Tadipani that night. The next morning, loaded with painkillers and with ankle taped, I continued. I thought I'd be able to manage but after an hour or so it was obvious that I couldn't. Binod had stayed close and he suggested he'd call for a helicopter when we got to Chuile - and before then I had to be carried for a couple of hundred metres over particularly rough ground.The rest of the trekkers, Nick, Jock, Mel, Ian, Graham and Joy, said goodbye and carried on and I was left behind, all grumpy because at this stage the toughest part of the trek was over and I'd been looking forward to a much easier time. The trek was actually a challenge to myself for my 70th birthday, and I guess I succeeded, despite being flown out on my actual birthday (what a present).It was certainly easier getting back to Kathmandu, although a bit scary when the helicopter pilot who picked me up put Binod down at the next scheduled stop so he could catch up with the other trekkers. I've been in helicopters quite a few times but had never before been in one that landed on a tiny mountain terrace such as that one in the Himalayas.Vayodha Hospital in Kathmandu was brilliant (except for the food). After a full check-up with X-rays and scans I was told I had a spiral fracture of the fibula and needed a plate inserted to hold it together. All told I was in hospital for four days. (My orthopedic surgeon back in Brisbane told me they'd done a first-class job.)Ram ensured that someone was available to give whatever help I needed and when it was time for my discharge provided cars and drivers to take me to and from my hotel so I could organise my flight home. There were logistical complications, including unexpected flight changes, but Ram never faltered or complained - he just got on with it and made things work.So, thanks again to all the team in Nepal. You were brilliant.And I mustn't forget to mention that the part of the trek that didn't involve my evacuation was excellent as well. All the guys from Himalayan Social Journey were helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The trek was challenging, so if you're interested, make sure you're fit for climbing. Going up about 1500m in a day doesn't sound too tough . . . but when you consider there are nearly as many down sections as up sections, well, you're probably climbing twice that. A couple of times I thought I wouldn't make it but I did, which is why I was so grumpy when it all had to end. Despite the accident I'm glad I did the trek."

From the moment my flight touched down at Kathmandu airport I saw the beaming smile of the Himalayan staff member waiting for me. I was whisked to Himalayan Social Journey office. All I could see were lovely faces with beaming smiles. I was treated like royalty. It seems like everbody was expecting me including Ram, the lovely and very charming managing director of the company. At 5pm that evening the group met for the first time. Our trip was discussed in details and each request noted. We also met our ever smiling guide Ganga. What a delightful man. Nothing too much trouble. He never forgets a request, ever. People, at times, can be demanding but I never saw a hint of annoyance. He was the guide, the problem solver, at times the agony aunt. Since I have a problem with climbing steps, he held my hand and encouraged me with every step, I am not talking about a few steps, I am talking about, sometimes, 6 hours of him pushing me every step of the way. I mean it when I say I could never have done it without Ganga. Binod, the 2nd guide also stayed with me for hours after everybody arrived to the destination with Binod singing lovely tunes to keep me entertained. I am in awe of these people, in fact I am in awe of the Nepalese people in general. Despite their poverty, they are very proud people, they are always happy to see you, eager to please and never expecting anything in return. The porters carried huge bags on their backs, always with smiles on their faces. I felt humble. This experience, these people taught me a lot about myself. I will never complain or worry about petty things. I will always remember this journey and these people as one of the best thing that happened in my life. Thank you Ganga, Ram. Binod, and each porter including my mountain man Bimsim who at one stage he saw me stumble and offered to carry me on his back. You are my hero \u263a\u263a"

We had signed up for the 10D9N guided tour but as we wanted to spend more time in Nepal, we decided to travel to Nepal 5 days before the start of the guided tour. As this was the first time in Nepal for the both of us, we had approached Ram from HJS to provide recommendations on places that we can visit during our additional days. Ram went beyond that and promptly helped us plan a 5-day itinerary which included sightseeing at Bhaktapur and treks and stays at beautiful places such as Nagarkot & Chisapani. We also managed to visit Thamel which was a 10-minute walk from Hotel Tibet (where we stayed) in Kathmandu.The accommodation and meals at the lodges (at Nagarkot & Chisapani) were beyond satisfactory and HJS ensured that the places we stayed at had the best views of the mountain range. The hosts at the lodges were also very warm and friendly. We felt like we were at home.The activities plannned in our itinerary during the 10D guided tour was diverse - city sightseeing in Kathmandu (Hindu & Buddhist temples), whitewater rafting along Trisuli River, canoeing, jungle trekking and elephant ride in Chitwan, trekking at Dampus, paragliding at Sarangkot and boating at Fewa Lake in Pokhara. Also, the itinerary was well-paced and hence, we had ample time to get some shopping done and exploring of the various places on our own. We felt relaxed and at the same time we felt very happy to have done the different types of activities.It was great pleasure to meet the wonderful HJS team in Nepal. We had a terrific holiday and Nepal is simply amazing. But none of that would have been possible without the help and all the efforts put in by the HJS team from the planning stage up to the very last minute that we left. Special mention and our sincere thanks to our guides Prakash Rijal, Binod Dhakal, the porters: Binod Ghastri, Santosh Devkota, Sudip & Mohan and the drivers: Bala & Dilip. Prakash was ever-ready to help when we had to make some minor changes to our itinerary even though we were travelling as a group during the guided tour. The porters too were very patient and encouraging when we were were slowing down during the treks. Not to mention the jokes, songs and laughter that was shared everyday. We felt incredibly lucky to have met such lovely people during our time in Nepal. Personally, we felt very happy and satisfied with everything that was done during our trip and we can't wait to come back.Thanks once again to HJS for everything that they have helped us with in making this a memorable trip for us and treating us as family. Dhanyabad! Hope to see you again in the near future! :)"

Our tour agent was Himalayan Social Journey and they did n excellent job in ensuring a well planned trip. A special mention to our guides, Prakash Rijal and Binod Dhakal. They were very friendly, caring and knowledgeable throughout the entire trip. They went beyond their means to ensure we were comfortable and safe. Prakash Rijal sang songs and kept encouraging us during our 9.5hour trek, and that totally motivated my friend Stella and I to complete the trek. Binod Dhakal also ensured we were ok and did all means to ensure we were comfortable. These two guys did a fantastic job and I am really glad I had them as my guides and will definitely recommened them to my other friends who wish to visit the exotic Nepal. They made us feel family and tht is important, especially in a foreign land. The porters included Binod, Santosh, Srideep and Mohan. The boys were very strong and really ensured that we were OK during our treks and adventures. They were so caring and friendly.Nepal was amazing and thanks to our wonderful guides and porters, we have a new found family back in Nepal. Kudos guys for an excellent team in HSJ!!!"

It was very uncomfortable and the bus was really squeezy. But for the rest of the journey, I took the tourist bus. Quite an experienced actually.

Weather was great the whole time we were there. We went with our friends and met 5 other people on the trip. Our guide Binod and the porters Ganesh, Bikash, Krishna and Ayush were absolutely fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better crew. Everything about the full trip was fantastic and so well organised. From booking the trip and asking many questions with quick responses from Shamila to being met at the airport (after being delayed a couple of hours) by our friendly guide Binod. One of our best ever holidays although the 6 day trek was far from easy. Do some preparation if you are thinking of going. There are thousands of steps up and down but the trek was so worth it with views to die for. Food amazing although accommodation basic but we are not complaining. We all enjoyed the full experience especially the rafting. Visit to Chitwan also excellent with friendly guide Madan who knew his wildlife. Only downside was a visit to the elephant breeding centre at Chitwan which was not good as these poor elephants were shackled by the ankle to a chain and could not move. This place needs closing down. However this was not HSJ fault although they could stop offering trips there. Elephant safari was ok as at least these animals get to move. We all loved Nepal and will return. The Nepalese people we met were so friendly. Would definitely use HSJ to arrange another trip. Thank you so much Ram for giving us a holiday of lifetime and thank you for employing such good people - they are a credit to your company. Darrell and Karen"

The porters are incredible - carrying our heavy bags, serving food and entertaining us with singing and dancing each evening - all done with happy smiles! Tip - take extra battery supply for your camera/phone as charging facilities are in high demand at the tea houses.If anyone is considering visiting Nepal - do it - and do it with Himalayan Social Journey."

A wise decision as we had a seven hour delay to land at Khatmandu (landed at 11.30pm) because of the weather. It was a welcoming sight to see our tour rep. The Samsara Resort Hotel, our base in Khatmandu after the tour as well, was clean, comfortable, quiet - considering it's location - had a nice garden to relax in. On booking this tour direct from the UK, we were geared up to be with a group, so was very surprised that we were the only ones in the group. At the time, somewhat disappointed by that, but thankful later on it was the case. So, for the rest of the trip we had a personal guide and porter that looked after us very well. The tour of Bhaktapur and Khatmandu was excellent, very informative. The itenerary was changed to suit our needs, we declined the rafting experience. Also, after discovering the second day's trek to Gohrepani was difficult for us, our route was changed. Our guide Bikash, was very patient and encouraged us to carry on, but slowly. Glad we did, the views were spectacular. We particularly liked the activities on the visit to Chitwan National Park. The hard bed at the Heritage Hotel was the only down side. The Hotel at Pokhara, Splendid View, was central and OK. The lodges along the trek were basic and OK once one accepted that level of comfort. All accommodation depends on what you pay. Being vegetarians, we were pleasantly surprised by the variety of food on offer at the Lodges and plenty of it. Worth noting that the roads are not very good and the bus trips are tiring. We flew back from Pokhara to Khatmandu, a half hour trip, rather than an eight hour road trip!!! On the whole it was an enjoyable experience, especially the Nepalase hospitality and specifically that of our guide, Bikash. We would definitely recommend Himalayan Social Journey for your Nepal experience."

Binod was our tour guide and I cannot speak highly enough of him, Binod was so helpful to me (I needed special attention) as I am not very good or skilled with heights (trekking the Himalayas perhaps not the ideal choice) however, he always looked after me...taking my hand when necessary to lead the way. We had such an amazing time with our fellow trekkers and porters too. This is the first time my husband and I have participated in a tour group and what a pleasant surprise it was. The facts, the food choice in the mountains is surprisingly good...Binod and our porters worked hard to ensure our food came out as ordered, at the same time and also arranged the bill paying at the end. Amazing! Accommodation, basic to more than basic, probably depends on the size of your group.. the smaller the group perhaps more choice We were a relatively small group with 8 trekkers, 4 delightful, fit, friendly, porters and one exceptional guide! Poon Hill the highlight of many. Ensure you prepare by doing some steps and some long bush walks 2-3 months prior (unless you are very fit then you will be fine) as this will ensure you can enjoy your trek...just slowly slowly and all will be well. I don't want to sound too gushy but honestly my husband and I travel a lot and rarely write reviews so be assured this review is very genuine.

At no stage did we feel rushed, and Binod proved a quietly efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable guide. This is a great trip if you have not visited Nepal before, as it combines so much. Climbing to 3,300 can be a struggle if you have been living at sea level, and other parts of the Annapurna circuit which we did not visit, are over 5,000 meters.

I finished off the trip with paragliding in Pokhara, which Ram organised for me, which was another highlight. I can highly recommend Himalayan Social Journey as a professional and attentive tour operator that is keen to ensure a good time is had by all."

What a fantastic experience! And much of the credit for that goes to the people at HSJ and their arrangements. Their communications prior to the trip were outstanding. Our guides throughout much of our tour, Binod & Milan, were tremendous. Not only were they genuinely attentive to our needs, they were wonderful, friendly company, and took great care to ensure the wellbeing and enjoyment of our entire group of 13, both on the trail and with the accommodation (Do try the Tibetan bread!). Our 6 porters were also pleasant, diligent and caring, and Binod did a wonderful job of uniting us all into a happy \"family\". The trek was certainly the highlight of our tour; the magnificent mountains of the Annapurna Range. But the entire trip was great. And HSJ exceeded all that had been offered in the tour details. We had an even better time than we had anticipated. So we hope to return for another tour soon and can highly recommend Himalayan Social Journey as an honourable, reliable operator.Rob and Sharon Anderton"

Absolutely absolutely enjoyed ourselves! Our tour guides at all three places were knowledgeable, trustworthy and accommodating. They looked after our welfare really well. We learnt so much about Nepalese and Sherpa culture. Trekking team was great! Made us feel at home and taught us their famous trekking sound especially during campfire nights :D The guest houses exceeded our expectations. We were blessed with great weather during sunrise and managed to get panoramic view of South Annapurna and Fishtail. After trekking for 3 days at Pokhara, we realized that we prefer Pokhara to Kathmandu and decided to extend our stay at Pokhara. The tour guide was really accommodating to change our flight to Kathmandu by extending it for another day with no additional charges. For that, we were so thankful although we informed them just a day before. Highly recommended and I would personally engage HSJ again for my future trips to Nepal ((: Satisfied customer :D"

The conclusion to the entire experience was \" the best trip ever\" This group included some well travelled individuals. What made this a once in a lifetime trip was a combination of the beautiful landscape of the Himalayas with the expert companionship of the tour guide and porters. To wake up in the morning with clean air and snow on the Himalayas is a privilege one cannot easily beat. HSJ made this all possible through professional staff all-round. Their continuous concern and helpfulness to ensure our comfort and safety was greatly appreciated by everyone. The hands-on owner and manager Ram Sapkota with the help of assistant Sharmila made our bookings and arrangements only a pleasure. Our guide and porters made it possible for our group ( ages around the 60 ) to enjoy every minute of the trekking despite the physically demanding terrain. My special thanks to Binod Dhakal, our tour guide who provided us with excellent companionship every step of the way. His charming, yet professional way of handling all situations will never be forgotten. The four porters also followed in his footsteps to make it an unforgettable and wonderful experience. We thank HSJ for making this a remarkable experience not easily to be forgotten."

Himalayan Social Journey provided everything we needed to have a safe trek: a trustful guide, 2 porters, one yak man and 3 yaks for a group of 14 people, plus sleeping bags and walking poles (so don't worry about buying these items) and all medical assistance needed (helicopter rescue, hospital transfer and airport pick up). Accommodation and lunch was pre-arranged so we knew where we were going to have lunch and spend the night each day of the trip, which were followed strictly as planned. Strongly recommend it if trekking is your thing, but make sure you have a great level of fitness to enjoy a lot more the journey. It's long, physically demanding and the higher you go the harder it gets. Unfortunately, hygiene is very poor in those areas so take extra caution with what you eat and drink. Make sure you have enough water tables, and bring hand sanitizes. Also, if you take photography very seriously it's worth to bring all your gear. Other than that have fun. =]HSJ staff is always available, helpful and very friendly."

HSJ really did an excellent job! We booked the 10 days package that mainly included Kathmandu city tour, 5-day trekking and dinner with cultural program.Our tour guide in Kathmandu [Pranav Thapa] was very nice. He put all his effort to answer all of our questions. We were also impressed by his knowledge.We were also very thankful that we had a very experienced, professional and knowledgeable trekking guide [Saran Adhikari]. It was really really wonderful trekking experience. Our trekking crew [the two porters; Bindaas Binod and Bhimshen Banjara] they were not only hard working but also very friendly, lively and cheerful. The trekking wouldn\u2019t have been this fun without them. We felt that were warmly treated as friends/guests rather than clients. We also have to thank our two trekking partners from Australia. There were very kind to us and we have shared a lot of memorable moments with them.We noticed that each accommodation provided during the trip was well selected by the company. The foods were also above our expectation.Yes, the trekking part was difficult for the girls who are used to living in flat city like Bangkok where public transportation is provided everywhere but the trekking with my team this trip was just so entertaining that I sometimes forgot the tiredness :D All in all, If you guys are thinking about coming to Nepal, I highly recommend HSJ."

We were so lucky with the weather and views of the majestic Annapurna's were better than we could ever had imagined. The accommodation, though basic, was very clean and better than expected. WIFI in the mountains as well. Our guide - Saran Adhikari - was terrific. His English is very competent, his knowledge of the Annapurna region was incredible and his friendly manner was fantastic. Our porters Binod Ghastri & Bhimsen Banjara were always laughing and joking and we were the envy of every other group because of the wonderful relationship that had grown between us that wasn't evident with other trekkers and their guides & porters. Saran taught us a Nepalese card game which we played every night with him, the porters and our two lovely travelling companions from Thailand.We are 50 plus and spent time training for the trek which we strongly advise you to do! Especially going up and down steps. We were fortunate to have two lovely Thai girls in our group and though they were much younger than us, we got on really well and have become good friends. To sum up no photo can do justice to the beauty and majesty of these mountains, it was worth every hard step of the way. The Nepalese people themselves are always beautiful and friendly, smiling always, even though you can see how hard their lives are. We cannot recommend the trek and Himalayan Social Journey highly enough as they made our journey a wonderful experience. Just go.Mark & Elaine from Perth, Western AustraliaVisited November 2014"

The experience and the service from the start from the whole HSJ team was awesome. The places we stayed at were clean and strategically located, definitely value for money. We also got to learn more about the country and the people with the local knowledge generously shared by all our guides (we had a different one for each city and trekking). Highlight of the trip was definitely the trekking, albeit only 2 days but it was a memorable experience. Our porter (Binod) and guide (Raju) looked after us and ensured that we not only enjoyed ourselves but also found laughter in every step that we took, even during the uphill ones. It's the little things that counts - chillies with soy sauce served with every meal (something I had been craving for), songs, jokes and a nudge whenever we were getting tired. In merely hours, they became our friends. Thank you to everyone involved in our trip, dhanyabad to all of you. I would definitely recommend this company."

Yes, the 2nd and 3rd day was hard, but for all the hard the work you put in those climbs, you get spectacular views in return. Everything went smoothly all because of the perfect planning of our guide Shankar. He also carries a lot of knowledge about the area and the people and makes the journey both fun and interesting. I can guarantee you the food and the accommodation is a lot better than you expect at least that was the case for us, but bare in mind that there might not always be hot water left. (I see people complaining that there's no hot shower in the mountains leaving lower grades in their reviews, you should know that this has nothing to do with the people in this company but the lodges in the mountains themselves, there is a limit on electricity and hot water there and that's it. We did experience a power-cut once or twice and it only lasted for around 20 seconds.) I also got an allergic reaction while I was up there leaving me covered in hives which later led to a swollen face, arms and feet that became a bit painful. This only occurred after dinner time and did not have any affect on the trekking other than some itching for a couple of hours a day. This is nothing to worry about though, everyone can react to something new in the mountains, sometimes heat, cold, food or new medicine. I say this so you remember to bring some antihistamines. I already brought zyrtec, and it does help a little bit, but try bringing something stronger aswell just in case. For me this was a problem, only because I couldn't find out the cause of reaction. But it never came back after we were back down in the city. The trek itself is in the middle of those 11days and lasts for 5 days. The rest of the days are spent in beautiful Pokhara and Kathmandu, where you get a guided tour of the cities getting to visit beautiful temples, pagodas and waterfalls and learning about the culture of nepalese people and religion. I have to say, Nepalese people are some of the kindest and most helpful people I have encountered, very similar to Thai people. Our stay here has been absolutely amazing and our plan about only visiting Nepal once has changed, we are definitely coming back and a lot of that is thanks to Ram and Shankar and the rest of the people we've been in contact with from Himalayan Social Journey.

Climbing to Gorepani/Poon Hill was definitely a lot more challenging than I thought it was going to be. It was also fascinating to be able to see Kathmandu with the city guide as well, even though the places they took us were 'popular', we had intimate explanations of each site and how things came to be. Very insightful. Our mountain guide Shankar was very knowledgable as we constantly asked him questions about the trek and the surrounding areas. It was great to have a local that has been on the trek numerous times taking care of us and essentially became our friend throughout the whole trip. He made sure food was ordered beforehand, so that we could squeeze ahead of larger groups and also entertained us with his magic card skills. There were times when I wanted to rest a little longer than usual but he always tried his best to keep us on track and on time. And I'm glad he did, so that I pushed myself a little further every time. The Poon Hill trek is perfect for first timers as well as seasoned trekkers as it is challenging enough and also provides such insane views. A lot of uphill steps are invoked and I powered through and am really satisfied in the end. My gf and I will certainly be returning and will be using Himalayan Social Journey again for our Everest Base Camp trek!"

We did the 14 day trip including the Annapurna/Poon Hill trek, white water rafting and Chitwan visit. But it was the trek that made it really special - even on the tougher days. It's not a walk in the park but provided you have a reasonable level of fitness you will have no problems - you just need to be able to walk all day. And it is worth it for the views and experience. Most of the tea houses were good if basic - don't go with high expectations: it is a poor country and facilities are basic. The only slight disappointment was the accommodation at Ghorepani - the rooms were damp and cold and not of the same standard as the other tea houses. But that was a minor inconvenience. Hotels in Kathmandu and Pokhara are also fine - again don't expect western standards but they will be clean and comfortable. After all, you only sleep there. I would love to go back and do a different trek - but only if we had the same guides etc."

From the excellent day trips around Kathmandu which included the Pashupatinath Temple, Boudhanath, Swaymbhu and Patan Durbar Square with our excellent guide Swami to the really beautiful drive up to Nagharkot which had terraced fields almost reaching heaven and beaut views of the snow capped mountains and then the magnificent cultural city of Bhaktapur, the excellent drivers, guides, porters and manager of Himalayan Social Journey could not be faulted.My lifelong ambition of trekking in the Himalayas was also fulfilled, the scenery on the Annapurna trek was spectacular and being a 60 year old, at times even though I found the trek physically challenging, mentally I was encouraged by our wonderful guide Raju and our porters Ancle and Govinda. I was elated, I did it. Many thanks to Himalayan Social Journey."

Our journey included a seven day trek through the lower Annapurna foothills and an optional Chitwan jungle extension. We did not know what to expect; this was going to be our first overseas multi day trek. We were pleasantly surprised by the prompt email responses of our tour organisation: the Himalayan Social Journey. The trek was fantastic. Coming from Australia, I would not call the foothills low. Our highest mountain, Mt Kusciuszko, is 2228 m, while we travelled up to 3100 m during our Annapurna trek. Our guide Shailesh, Sherpa Milan and porters were all nice and very helpful, while giving each individual the opportunity to walk at their own pace. It made this trip a wonderful experience. We have decided to do Kokoda next year May and in 12 months time we will be returning to Nepal to do Everest Base Camp. I think that is the best recommendation I can give! Happy trekking!"

Our guides Bishnu and Deepak were absolutely fantastic. Whilst accommodation and toilet facilities are not what we would normally come to expect, the general lack of facilities are to be expected in these isolated mountains. Ultimately, they add to the sense of adventure which is an experience that not many people around you can say they have achieved. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

They offer an affordable price with excellent services. I found them very helpful, informative and very responsive to all my queries and requests. They have successfully delivered all their promises and kindly tailor-made the trip based on my needs. I had a 7-day trek to Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) last October. It was SO amazing!! The views along the trek were such breathtaking beauty. I also had a chance to interact with Gurung people, one of the tribes in Nepal. Visited their mini museum where I could see the Gurung ancient utensils. A special thanks goes to Shankar, a friendly, attentive and caring guide who has taken care all the necessary things for this trek. October was a peak season but Shankar managed to book the lodges for my (and other 3 friends in the group) stay during the trekking. He is also knowledgeable about the area that I could gain a lot of information from him. Impressive Trip!"

Advice/must, is to have a little of training before heading for the trek as there are a lot of stairs and more. Also it might be a good idea to cart your sleeping bag along and good raincoats.Thanks to HSJ for my amazing adventure. way to go to experience the wonderful Nepal.Recommend ++++"

I brought my 12yo son along to Nepal for the 11 day trek to Poon Hill and we added an extra 4 day trip to Chitwan National Park. I chose this relatively easy trek for my son but it turned out he was in better shape than me (as he had just finished yet another season of weekly football games) and coped fine with all the walking.First, the company's administration and logistics were well organised and efficient. I booked months ahead and had questions of logistics over time but Sharmila always returned emails promptly with clear answers to any queries. I arrived confident that I would be looked after and I was. The 11 day Poon Hill trek started with a tour of World Heritage sites in Kathmandu, which were all amazing places to visit as well as a rafting trip on the Trisuli River. Our special guide was very informative although a bit hard to hear and understand sometimes; still, his forays into philosophical principles and the myriad gods of hinduism were enlightening. The rafting trip was great fun yet very safe because the Trisuli is a big river with great scenery and big rapids but very few rocks or hard bits.The trek to Poon Hill was hard work as we had a steep trail to climb on the second day to get to Ghorepani, which of course wasn't the company's fault, but they did rate the walk as easy to moderate, which it is by Himalayan standards, but probably moderate to hard by Australian standards. I would suggest they make it clearer that trekking in the Himalayas is always hard work as they are extreme mountains and that any guests should keep this mind.Our guide, Binnod, was a great leader, always informing us of the upcoming activities and constantly doing his best to address any concerns. He and the porters were always fun to hang out with as well; it was a real social journey!Once our trek ended we moved on to Chitwan National Park. Due to some paperwork errors by HSJ management we didn't have seats on the bus from Kathmandu but they recovered from the mistake very well, got us into another group in a private van and even compensated with another raft trip. They took us to Hotel Hermitage in Sauraha, which was a charming if slightly rundown hotal right on the river across from the national park. Our wildlife guide from the Hotel was Madan Chaudry, who was fantastic as he knew the park very well as well as every bird call; we saw lots of interesting wildlife but seeing rhinos was eluding us until the last day and Madan was finally able to find a mother and calf for us to see which was quite thrilling.We spent over two weeks in Nepal, mostly looked after by HSJ, and they made our trip easy and fun. I would happily go with them again in the future."

Our guides Binod & Milan did a great job, they kept the group humming along, always checking how each of us was going, nothing was too much trouble, they made our trip so enjoyable no matter how tough the environment got. The porters were fantastic carrying huge loads everyday, my thanks to Kalyan, Subus A, Subus B, Ganesh, Akal & Krishna for all your efforts everyday, finding the things we'd lost before we even knew we'd lost them and sticking with us on the trail so no one walked alone when the group got strung out. A highlight of the trip that's not advertised is the singing and dancing put on by the guides & porters In the evenings, the fun and happiness was infectious not to mention great for the soul. I'd highly recommend this trip to anyone, young or old, it provides a great cross Section of what Nepal has to offer, I LOVED every minute of this trip!!!

From our initial email contacts, booking our pre tour accommodation, to dropping us off at the airport, HSJ looked after us. As first time trekkers, we were a little apprehensive about this part of our trip, however, it was the highlight. Not only because of the stunning scenery, but because of our guides and porters. Binod (Mr a little bit up a little bit down) and Milan (Mr calculator) looked after their \"family\" every step of the way and were fantastic in insuring that we had everything we needed. And as for our 6 porters, their ever smiling faces and encouragement never ceased to amaze us. How they all found the energy is sing, dance and entertain us at the end of the day is beyond me. They are all a credit to themselves and to HSJ. Accommodation and food on the trek is basic but good and the accommodation in Pokhara and Chitwan exceeded our expectations. The only negative for me was the visit to the elephant park. Seeing these beautiful animals on short chains was distressing. Several people in our group chose not to go elephant riding and of those that did, many said they would not do it again. Whilst the conditions that they are kept in is not HSJ's fault, it may be worthwhile considering that many people out there do not enjoy or want to support this kind of tourism and provide other options. Would we visit Nepal again, absolutely and would we choose HSJ, definitely. Well done Ram, you have an excellent group of dedicated people."

A friend and I did a 7 day trek in the Langtang region in October 2014 - our second time with Himalayan Social Journey and they impressed us again!The trek itself was absolutely spectacular - all the way from Syraphru Besi to Kyanjin Gompa. Both the accommodation at the tea houses (or lodges) and the food were good. I recommend basing yourself for a couple of days at Kyanjin Gompa as you can then explore the beautiful village - make sure you check out Dorje Cafe (the cake is scumptuous!). This will also give you time to climb Kyanjin Ri and Tsergo Ri and/or do a day trek further along the Langtang valley.Putting aside the stunning scenery, the trip was made all the more memorable by the exceptional service provided by our Guide (Binod Gharti) and porter (Kumar). They were so well organised, highly attentive - and had a great sense of humour. They really went above and beyond (playing cards with us - and preparing a delicious plate of fuit each night as a treat) - we would consider them both friends.

Lets start by being up front ...these days whenever you engage with a tour operator ( restaurant, guide etc etc) the final thing they do is ask you to recommend them on Trip Adviser - which of course is exactly what Ram at Himalayan Social Journey did. The fact that it was our second time arranging our trip through them should have made it clear that he didnt need to worry .....if it hadn't been great the first time we'd have voted with our wallets and simply booked elsewhere. On our first trip to Nepal in 2013 we joined a HSJ group tour for the Gorapani Trek ...which was amazing . This time around though we didn't want to join a group or do a 'set tour' - wanting to visit India before moving on to Nepal and an extended trek to Kayjin Gompa . Ram coordinated with another operator -Abid- in India to arrange our trip exactly as we wanted it -including last minute alterations made necessary by Malaysian Airlines .Really - you could arrange a trek yourself but its very reassuring (and relaxing ...its meant to be a holiday -right?) to know that someone ( probably the ever helpful & smiling Dilip) will be at the airport to pick you up and get you back to catch your flight after the adventure is over ...and that everything in between including meals, accommodation, entertainment ( the guides and porters can all sing and dance AS WELL AS carry a load that would squash another mere mortal!) and thoughtful and informed guidance about the trek, country and people along the way is all arranged. Having someone else arrange the details of your trek could make you feel like you've lost control over your trek/adventure experience but its not like that - more like Nepalese friends hosting you on a fantastic tour of their amazing country and culture ...trust, relax and enjoy :)"

We had a small group, which was really nice, and our guide (Binod) and porters (Pokas and Santos) were absolutely fantastic. The company were really flexible and accomodating as well, even agreeing to let us stay in Ghorepani an extra night (much appreciated!). Binod and the guys did so much more than just guiding/portering - they helped out the staff at the guest houses with our meals and ordering, and sometimes even cooking! The Annapurna trek was beautiful, all our accomodation for the trek was in guest houses that were basic but lovely and clean with fantastic views (once the clouds cleared!). The accomodation in the other places - Chitwan, Pokhara, Kathmandu - was great, no complaints there. It would have been nice to spend another day in Chitwan as there was so much to do, and it's such a lovely little town, but it was great to have an afternoon free to wander, drink and shop. The jungle walk and canoeing in Chitwan were great (if a little scary!). I personally found the conditions the elephants are kept in at the Army/breeding centre rather sad (most the elephants there were hobbled) and some of the elephant safari mahouts seemed to treat their elephants rather badly, but this isn't a reflection on Himalayan Social Journey at all. All in all, a really positive trip with a great bunch of people. I have every intention of coming back to Nepal (dhal bat power, 24hr!) and couldn't reccomend Himalayan Social Journey highly enough :)"

We liked one of the places in the mountains so much we stayed an extra night! Ram the owner went to lots of effort to make sure everyone was happy. Our guide, Binod was excellent (so get him if you can! ). Our porters, pakcash and santos (I think I spelled their names wrong, sorry!) were lovely and did so much more then just carry of bags. The scenery was spectacular (when we could see it, we had a few rainy days!). The places we stayed in the mountains were basic but always clean and there was some fantastic food up there! We got to see a wild rhino and her calf during a jungle walk in Chitwan. The only thing I didn't like about the experience was visiting the elephants while in Chitwan as I thought they were cruelly treated (this is outside Himalayan social journeys control). All in all a great experience and I would gladly use the company again and recommend it to my friends!"

The Himalayan Social Journey were great I travelled by my self to Kathmandu , they were their to meet me when I arrived and all the activities and trek went as planned. Our guide for the trek was binoid or binny who looked after us all the way making sure that everything was ok, including personally cooking my eggs so they were runny. To all those in the Himalayan Social Journey HSJ a big thank you for making this one of the most memorable trips I have ever had. This was one of the best things I have done, It was physically and mentally challenging but the scenery and culture were amazing which made it all worth it. Like others I would go back again no problems. Note from my journal, an experience of a lifetime that will never be forgotten from singing bowls in Kathmandu to mountain peaks rising through the clouds, exposed to the extremes of nature that have ever changing views that will amaze you. Love this from on a tea shirt at one of the lodges \" the beauty brings tears to my eyes and then freezes them to my cheeks.. Don't forget to bring a flag or some memorabilia to leave at the lodge to commemorate your trek. Read the HSJ web page for hints on what to bring and don't be afraid to get a warm jacket in Kathmandu especially us warmer climes people as it's a lot cheaper than at home or on line. The altitude my effect some people so be prepared, neurofen and diamox worked for me. Lastly for those that procrastinate like me using Nike shoes example,,Just do it!"

Our trip organiser, Ram, went above and beyond to make sure all guests were happy and accommodated at all times.Our guide, Dhakal Binod, or Binny as he is affectionately known, was the best guide I have ever had! He was thoughtful and attentive at all times. Day or night he always made himself available!He pointed out anything of interest on our journey large or small, shared meals, games and jokes keeping us in good spirits when things got tough and made sure everyone was safe, comfortable and happy. I have never known a more dedicated and lovely guide and, having been a Sherpa/porter previously, has earned his guide position through dedication and amazing service. Having done the trek over 30 times Binod has a wealth of knowledge and knows all the local people - making him a great link to the culture and language of this amazing culture.Having done the trek in summer, I am keen to return to this trek in the winter season with my brothers, and I am definitely using and recommending Himilayan Social Journey! And my favourite tour guide Binny - whom I now keep on Facebook as a firm and life long friend! Natasha McDonald Brisbane, Australia"

Let's not forget our porters and our guide, Binood. Binood was always professional, but importantly compassionate and considerate to all within our group. So much so that our team got through without any challenges. Besides the physical aspects of the trek itself, the scenery was something to behold, almost out of a Tolkien book.

This particular trek is not for the faint hearted and does require a level of fitness and prior preparation to get the most from it especially if you are 50 plus but the gain far outweighs the pain.

This was my first trip to Nepal and an excellent way I think to experience a taste of what this beautiful country has to offer. Himalayan Social Journey looked after our group of 11 with care and, at times, extraordinary patience. We had quite varying degrees of fitness levels in our group, so our guides and porters were fantastic ensuring that we were all looked after, especially those that really struggled with the heat and the thousands of steps we had to climb. The itinerary was interesting and varied (white water rafting, elephant riding, canoeing, cultural shows) with lots of chances to see the real Nepal and meet the beautiful people. The accommodation varied from the very basic guesthouses to 5 star luxury in Chitwan National Park, and the food overall was really good. Morning sunrise on the top of Poon Hill is an absolute must. Quite simply amazing.The only thing I would have liked more of was the Yoga and Meditation. 2 classes was just not enough with all that trekking!Thank you to Ram, Rameswhar, Shankar, Prakash, Binod, Subas, Bikash and Amreet for making my trip to Nepal so special.

Hence, my expectations with Himalayan Social Journey were not set on lofty grounds. However, I could not be more wrong, and I strongly believe I am saying this for the 10 other travellers whom I've trekked with for 2 weeks.Every aspect of the tour was taken care of. There was no need for us to worry about anything. From airport transfers to trekking equipment to hotel accommodation, Himalayan Social Journey was meticulous in their dealings. During the trek, our guides were fantastic. Binod, Tenzen, and Sherpa (the awesome dude commanding the yaks) were so amiable and friendly that they have no qualms about treating complete strangers as family. Their knowledge and experience in the mountains were also utterly impressive.Ram, the boss of the company, was the most jovial man in Kathmandu. His warm, passionate attitude might surprise you at first, but within minutes, you would feel his sincerity. What happened to me during the trip was that I had to be hell-evacuated from Periche due to an unfortunate eye infection. Ram took it upon himself to handle all the financial and logistical matters. I have never been able to get around the fact that an almost complete stranger was willing to fork out thousands of dollars as a guarantee. His care for his customers really bewilders me.Himalayan Social Journey takes care of your every need and concern. I have never been so pleased with a tour agency. They truly deserve the 5 stars and please do sign up tour packages with them - you won't regret it."

The 5 days trek around Annapurna Circuit is quite challenging, but the beautiful mountains, valleys & villages make this a truly worthwhile experience. The accommodation on the trek is pretty basic, but the food and kindness of the Nepalese people sure make up for that. If we ever were lucky enough to return to Nepal, we would certainly link up again with Himalayan Social Journey. Peter & Ineke G"

The team at HSJ prior to getting to Nepal were always quick to reply to any questions I had & were very informative. Ram is a great organiser & when we were stuck in Kathmandu Airport as Lula airport was closed due to weather he provided different options we could take, but fortunately the weather lifted so we could keep to the original plans.Once we got to Lukla we were met by our guides Bishnu & Geljen who were to make our trek a terrific experience along with Mingma our Yak herder. Word of warning though, when you play cards with these guys, keep your cards close to your chest & eyes open!The trek was challenging, particularly when illness hit, but the scenery, the people were just amazing.If I ever get back to Nepal I would have no qualms in going straight back to HSJ for another tour.Thank you RAM & the team, you provided a wonderful experience."

Both Raju and Homnath took very good care of us and make sure we were comfortable at each accommodation and had everything we needed along the way. They were also fun to be with, which was a major bonus! The bus ride to and from Kathmandu is pretty intense, but we made it safely :) We were impressed with the company from the beginning. We received prompt replies to our many questions by email even before we booked the package. We feel confident recommending HSJ and especially the services of Raju and Homnath."

Had a great trip but not for the faint hearted. It is not for someone who is not fit. Long days and thousands of steps up and down. Very hard on the knees. Suggest if you decide to go buy your trekking gear including clothing when you get to Kathmandu. More expensive in Pokohara. Kathmandu is set up for trekking you will pay about a 1/5 of the cost as in Australia. You need a down jacket for poon hill but you can hire that if required from Pokohara very cheap.  The guides and porters are just amazing, helpful lots of happiness, laughter , singing and dancing. We were in a group of 20 picked up from the airport and returned to the airport at the end of trip. Great group"

And on the trek, Binod, our expert knowledgeable guide, was very patient and a perfect host at all the venues. He was always approachable and ensured we really enjoyed the trek (even chasing up extra blankets when the nights got a bit cool!). I cannot recommend Ram and his team highly enough."

We were met at the airport as arranged by out guide Binod which was a relief given the chaos of Kathmandu airport. We were pleasently suprised by the initial hotel accomodation and the enthusiasm and friendliness of Ram and Binod.Throughout the duration of the trek Binod and the other two guides looked after us very well and again we were suprised by the accomodation we stayed in each night, (we were expecting a lot less from the research we had done into other peoples experiences with different companies). The group we were with was great,all Australians and ranging in age, experience and fitness, everyone got along well and looked after each other both during the trekking days and in the evening, (some people struggled with fitness and others with health issues due to the altitude). I must commend Binod and the other guides including our yak driver who completed a stretcher rescue of one of our group from Base Camp back to Gorek Shep, a really amazing feat.There are a couple of issues I want to raise which were a concern and could be done better, we were guaranteed a group of maximum 10 people, we ended up with sixteen, this caused some initial issues with equipment but which were sorted out at the 11th hour, however we do feel that the increased numbers left out guides over stretched. Due to the different fitness levels we found the group got too spread out with the front people out of sight with the lead guide and the slow people way back with another guide, this left the bulk of the group (in the middle) wandering the Himilayan range on their own, (the third guide was usually back with the yaks) admitedly its hard to get lost but a couple of times it did happen to people, and in the case of someone having an accident it is a safety issue. So Ram, if you want bigger groups this needs to be addressed. We also met up with people once the trek was over and we were back in Kathmandu who had also just finished the trek with HSJ there group was also supposed to be 10 and was infact 17! We also discovered that the porters were going through personal baggage and moving things from bag to bag, apparantly in order to balance the Yaks? this left one person without their sleeping bag for a night before it was located the next day. This is a NO NO as far as we were concerned. As I said earlier we had a really great experience with HSJ and think we got great value for money, I hope the issues raised will be taken on board for the benefit of other trekers. For first timers, you need a good level of fitness to really get the most enjoyment out of this trek. A couple of months spent in the gym would be a huge advantage."

The team changed my perception towards Nepal and Nepalese in general, in a very good way.I had 1001 questions (& worries), but my emails were promptly responded by Sharmilla.Ram was very flexible to accommodate & receptive to our idea. We went through the itinerary again & again upon arrival, as I keep changing my mind. Thank you so much, Ram, for your understanding. The trip to Bhutan, was just as great. Thank you for an excellent choice of tour operator with a 1st class tour guide, Thinley @ Spider. (We have met fellow travellers who has not been as lucky).Dilip with his pleasant & easygoing attitude and smiling face, loves to make jokes. He has made the journey to Pokhara and Sarangkot very enjoyable & comfortable despite the road condition & long drive. Raju with his lovely voice & nice laugh is a very experienced trekking guide. Couldn't have done the trek without his motivation. Sometimes trekking, sometimes rafting...While the country is still developing in many ways, I find it safe and convenient. Indeed the team has made the trip very pleasant & smooth. There was no hiccup at all!Whenever I think of Nepal, I will remember friends with easygoing personality, kinship, positive attitude, gratitude & zest towards life. Something to learn from them. I strongly recommend Himalayan Social Journey to anyone looking for a great time in Nepal - wherever you chose to go. :)"

An example of the dedication was when our flight from Pokhara back to Kathmandu was cancelled due to bad weather . One phone call to Mr. Ram and within minutes accomodation was sorted as well as return transportation back to Kathmandu. What a relief ! He team is always ready to respond at any time of the day .

All my emails leading up to booking with them and then the many sent after booking were always responded to speedily by Ram. And I had countless questions. Nothing was a problem and his service amazing. He even made the point of coming to welcome us and then once again when we left giving us his blessing.The trek itself we were blessed to have the best guide and Sherpas we could have wanted.I was the slowest in the group and our amazing guide Binod was always there with an encouraging word and stayed with us along the way without being intrusive. He would make sure we were safe and as we were always the last ones to arrive at the guest houses at the end of the day he would get there last with us.We had 4 hardworking wonderful Sherpas, Geljen, Asish,Sunman and Raj. As we would complain about how difficult the hills and walk was (well me anyway) those boys were carrying25 kgs on their backs and bounding up the hills always beating the group to the next stop.A special mention has to go out to one of our Sherpas Gelgen. He was truly my angel over there helping me with anything and everything. His kindness was truly appreciated and will never be forgotten.I truly miss those boys.The trip is full of many different experiences from the chaos of Kathmandu to visiting all the sights there. Through to the amazing scenery in the Himalayas and of course the satisfaction of making it to Everest Base Camp.I cannot gloss over the fact that it is exhaustingly difficult, or unbelievably cold in the eveningsbut if a 50 year woman can do it than so can you. It is without a doubt the trip of a lifetime just make sure before you attempt it you really must have done adequate training before you go.Also remember you are in Nepal and things are not like they are at home. Power cut outs what seems to be every hour or so and bathrooms not like you have probably seen before and in the mountains not many with running water. Just bring your wet wipes, grab a shower when you canand at the end of the trek at the lodge back in Lukla the best shower you have ever had in your life will be waiting for you.Thank you for having us in your wonderful country."

What made it a life time experience was our guide Ram Chandra, his assistant guide, Milan who was our porter and the other three porters for our group of 8 - Amrit (the cheeky one), the quite one and the older one. Ram Chandra led the team in ensuring everyone was catered for, running through each day how everyone felt and briefing the group on what to expect the next day. He provided necessary information with good humour, kindness and understanding. The group, guide and porters blended in well and made it so much fun along the way as we climbed up and down step after step after step. Nothing was a problem for the gentle 'No Probs' man (Prabin). The trek was amazing with beautiful and changing scenery every day. From very hot weather, heavy rain, hail, snow and freezing temperature, we seemed to get it all and added to the fantastic experience. The food was an experience on its own as we were guided by Ram Chandra as to what was safe for us to eat and drink at each stop. Our porters led by our assistant guide Milan were always there when you needed them, attentive and offering assistance and could not do enough for us. We also visited Chitwan National Park which was great. I would recommend staying there for at least 3 nights so to have the opportunity for either a full day or half day jeep safari. We missed the farewell dinner in Kathmandu with our group and was escorted to one for just us by our porter Milan for a final memorable Nepali experience of great food and culture on our last night in Kathmandu. Our whole holiday in Nepal was organised through HSJ. All in all, Ram (owner) has a great team of people working for him from the ones that pick you up from the airport and happy to take you wherever you need to go, the guides, porters and everyone you come into contact with. We had minor glitches with accommodation changes, but enjoyed our time in Nepal so much we hope to return in the next couple of years for a higher and longer trek. Thanks to everyone at Himalayan Social Journey!"

            "review": "Amazing Nepalese Experience. I travelled to Nepal in November 2013 with a friend. We had organised the Everest base camp trek with HSJ, who had been very helpful throughout the process. We arrived in Nepal and stepped out of the crazy airport with little clue as to what was going on, navigated our way through the crowds and out into the pick up area. We were ushered to a car by someone carrying the sign so we followed and took the bumpy ride into Nepal whilst our chaperone Binod pointed out the sights. We finally arrived at the office and we met with Ram (managing director) who greeted us with generous Nepalese hospitality and helped us go through our itinerary. Everything was organised and despite having to change things around due to the election unrest at the time we were on our way for our stay at the Chitiwan National Park, where we rode elephants, canoed crocodile infested waters, trekked through jungle in search of elusive rhinos amongst a myriad of other fun activities whilst staying at a river side resort.After returning from this adventure we met up with the trekking group back in Nepal where and flew out to Lukla for the beginning of the trek. The trek up to Everest basecamp is a 7ish day affair which takes you through breathtaking scenery on a journey which is sometimes challenging, with dusty narrow trails, yak trains to dodge, swinging suspension bridges, ankle twisting stones, freezing showers (if any at all) and if you are unlucky altitude sickness. Don't let these challenges deter you however, our guides binod and bisnu were a wealth of knowledge and were more friends than just guides. We were fortunate to travel with a great bunch of people and experience some of the most amazing scenery in the world. I had the misfortune of being affected heavily by altitude sickness and flew down from Everest base camp by helicopter (which was stunning as well)Finally on the last day I had a personal driver to take me around the city to see all the sights. He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and I had a great day.One thing I must say is that the staff at HSJ especially Ram and Binod, were extremely accommodating and nothing was too hard. The level of service was unparalleled to anything I had experienced before. There was always someone ready to meet us from the bus, ferry us between locations, made changing flights extremely easy, put up with the insurance and medical processes just to name a few. I feel that this service is a reflection of the hard working nature of Ram and his team who strive to make your experience the best possible.One thing that should be noted is that for fussy people, accommodation isn't 5 star, you will be hassled on the street constantly to buy drugs, give food, money, buy stuff, the air is dusty and smoky. On the trek the going can be tough at points even if you are of reasonable fitness, and the accommodation and creature comforts become more Spartan the higher you are. However the people that make this trek possible, the friends you make along the way, the food, the culture, the amazing temples, the breathtaking scenery, the challenge; these overshadow any of the negatives, and if you go in prepared for the journey you will be guaranteed to have an amazing experience which you will never forget and talk about for years to come.Thanks again to Ram and Binod from HSJ and the guides Bisnu and Binod"

Himalayan Social Journeys took care of most things for this trip for the most part - domestic flights to Lukla, lodgings & breakfast for the entire trip, suitable sleeping bags filled with down, trekking poles and most importantly, the most well-informed and friendly guide and porters we could ask for on a fairly challenging trip as such - Befriend them and be bestowed with insight on life in the mountains... and don't forget to tip them for their hard work and TLC ! Be prepared to rough it out a bit. Weather can get bad, and you might have to wait it out (could be a few days) or opt for a chopper ride at additional cost if you're pressed for time. Expect rooms to be colder as you ascend. You will rewarded with fantastic views - plural - and an experience you won't forget ! Cultural dinner and dance on the last night is a slightly posh affair to reward your hard work. Ram's warm and affable personality was representative of the Nepali culture and community, and places HSJ as an approachable and accommodating group for me to join again for any future trips to the Himalayas for sure."

The highlights were the Everest flight, elephant riding, sitting on the back of an elephant in the river getting wet (elephant bathing), rafting, climbing to the top of Poon Hill to see the sun rise over the Himalayas, and paragliding with the back drop of the snow capped Himalayas.Some tips:1. Be vaccinated against everything - many vaccinations cover for other things (cholera covers for many of the organisms associated with traveller's diarrhoea)2. Carry a small packet of tissues everywhere3. When you go rafting you will get wet, actually saturated - be prepared and dress accordingly.4. The lodges while trekking are good - no need to take a sleeping bag. You get a bed with a fresh sheet and a duvet/doona. It is fine. Take earplugs as the walls are paper thin and there is nothing like exhaustion to make people snore.5. Pay extra to catch the plane from Pokhara back to Kathmandu, as it is worth it. When you travel in the bus from Kathmandu to go rafting you will know why."

Highly recommended.Ram, the owner, was very welcoming and personal in his dealings with us all, we felt very informed across the entire time and no request was a problem for him. Very friendly and professional. The accommodation in Kathmandu I felt was quite good given the other options around us. In Pokhara it was excellent. A big difference we saw was that we seemed to get the pick of the guesthouse rooms well in advance. We never had to worry about missing out and also got the good info from Saran each day on which showers were always hot or which facilities were a bit nicer etc-very welcome info after a hard day walking. We also stayed at some places along the way which were a little different to the usual stops. Places where the food or accom was a little better etc..This was a great move I thought, sometimes we had walked an extra 15 minutes and had landed at a better destination than most did. These guys really know where the better places are and this is where it comes in handy each day. The trek itself was only a little more strenuous than I thought, but most certainly achievable. The first few days will be a little tough on the body but its amazing how fast your body responds. Overall this is still a trek that most people could do. Be prepared for what seems like an infinity of stone steps up huge mountains and then down again as this is the majority of the walking, especially before you get right up in the higher altitudes. Altitude symptoms for most people are a dull headache for an afternoon and a morning around ABC. The way the team planned it made a huge difference to how we managed the symptoms. It didn't really give any of us much grief though so don't be too concerned with it. They're keeping their eye on you. Only a few small things I'd recommend to improve the experience... Flying directly back from Pokhara to ktm most definitely, after a couple of days in Pokhara to regroup after the trek. Missing out on the rafting after the trekking kinda sucks (it was great) but given you have to drive for the best part of a day on one of the worst roads in the world to get from Pokhara to Kathmandu I think not doing the rafting is a good trade off. The road really is shocking. It would not make a big difference to the costings to fly back so definitely ask to do it. Any time you need a great driver to take you somewhere, Dilip is your man. Excellent SAFE driver and when you're in Nepal, this is a huge plus. The other driver who took us from Pokhara to Nayapul to start the trek was also a very skilled and experienced driver but was way too fast. And I've travelled extensively on asian roads...We had an awesome 4WD too when other groups had little minivans- another plus to HSJ. But it doesn't matter how good a driver you are if you're travelling at twice the speed limit, even on flat roads...slow down. I don't want these small things to overshadow the rest because this really is an amazing experience with an exceptional group of people running it. I will most definitely be recommending HSJ, Saran, Bhimsen and Amrit to others. And I will be back. You all made this more than a trek, especially Saran. Day after day you made sure we were looked after and we knew everything we needed to know. We all noticed and appreciated the difference you made to our time there, thank you. As for the mountains and what it feels like to be up there.....? You just have to find that out for yourself because I haven't got the words to do it justice. Just book it, you won't regret it. Troy"

From the beginning, Ram - the owner - was very attentive and timely responded to my e-mail queries.When we first arrived in Kathmandu, Ram brought us to his office and throw in ideas to customize our itineraries from the original one. We then decided with Kathmandu sight seeing, overnight in Nagarkot (first sighting of the Himalaya), Bakthapur sight seeing, rafting and overnight camping in Tirishuli river (grade 3), activities in Chitwan (jungle trekking, elephant ride, etc.), sight seeing in Pokhara (including up-close encounter to Himalaya's peaks: Annapurna, Machapuchare, Manaslu), and trekking in Sarangkot.Arrangement on accomodations throughout the tour were basic but clean with hot water available in most of the properties.Other highlight of having HImalayan Social Journey as tour arranger was having our Malay speaking local guide, Bishnu, although we told Ram earlier that we're okay with English speaking one. But we're very glad to have Bishnu throughout the trip as he was very helpful and always concern with our well-being. Our group consisted of 5 females ranging from mid 30s to 50s in age. When we were traveling in tourist bus from Kathmandu-Chitwan-Pokhara, Bishnu ensured that we're comfortable and save particularly during our ride from Tirishuli river to that was stretched to 5 hours (from normal 2.5 hours) due to pre-election strikes and disturbances that were happening across Nepal. When we did the trekking in Sarangkot, Bishnu cheerfully helped us with the steep and difficult tracks since couple of us were afraid of height and having knee condition.Overall, we had great time and definatly one of most memorable experience for my friends and I. Thank you Himalayan Social Journey for making this trip a memorable one."

The tour was well planned, diverse and well-paced, Himalayan Social Trekking covered all the details leaving us to enjoy their beautiful country and friendly, welcoming people. The guides and porters were also wonderful. They enhanced the journey with their friendly, engaging manner and did everything in their power to make our tour special in every way. They sang and danced at all the rest stops moulded seamlessly into our group till at the end of our stay we felt that we all belonged together as family. There wasn\u2019t a discordant note during the whole journey. I was very sorry when the journey came to an end. If you are considering journeying to Nepal my advice to you is \u2018just do it\u2019. You\u2019ll never regret it. The experience was one of the most memorable and unforgettable journeys of my life. I also have no hesitation in giving Himalayan Social Trekking and it\u2019s staff the highest recommendation. They are honest, friendly and hardworking and will do everything to make your journey very, very special."

From the first day to the last day they ensured all on our trip had a great time. The sights of Kathmandu, white water rafting, elephant safari (even got up close to a mother Rhino and her baby), trekking through the mountains, and more. The beauty was that our guides always had things under control and yes the accommodation un the mountains is basic but clean and comfortable and after a big day trekking any bed feels good :) I was expecting very basic food but the places we stayed at had a good range of choices. When I talked with other groups they had similar itineraries to us but what they didn't have was our guides and porters. Their infectious smiles and energy added something extra to this trip which made it feel like family. How they could still have the energy to sing and dance after a days trek will always amaze me. There are plenty of companies in Nepal that do these trips but if you want one whose crew do everything they can and end up as your friends than you need to go with Himalayan Social Journey.My boots blew out after the first day of the trek so I went to throw them out but one of the porters end up getting a needle and some heavy duty thread, end result was they made it all the way to the end of the 5 day trek. This is just one case of that little bit extra they do.Thanks Ram for putting such a good crew together and look forward to returning to NepalPete"

The program of the trip was extensive and varied. We had yoga classes, temple visits, rafting and the cream of the cake - mountain trekking. Ram, Binod, and Amrit took such great care of the group to ensure that we all are very well taken care of. Both guides and porters were such great bunch of guys that they were like a family by the end of the trip. Nepal is truly a magnificent country with majestic scenery and the Nepali make our experience even more magical. We love their ever so happy, patient and serene ways of life. Nepal is not a destination for someone who would like a pampering holiday. Hotels and accommodation is basic, electricity or wifi may be unreliable. Mountain stays are even more basic than in the city. Foods, however, was very good and safe. Mountain trekking is quite arduous but a sense of achievement is well worth the effort.I would rate the experience as 5 out of 5 if not for the mouldy bathrooms during our Kathmandu stay. However, i would strongly suggest everyone to visit the country and use Nepal Social Journey to organise the tour as I found it to be reliable and of good value."

Sight seeing, rafting, elephant ride, jungle safari, relaxing in Pokhara and five incredible days trekking in the stunning Annapurna region; the tour ticked all the boxes of what to see and do during a short stay in Nepal. Ram made our planning easy, including arranging activities and accommodation for our time before and after the tour, and providing a wonderful driver to care for us during those days. Our accommodation throughout was clean and comfortable and the food tasty, nutritious and plentiful. Our guide was caring, informative and fun. He and the boys looked after us like family. Extremely professional in each of their roles, they also laughed, played beautiful music, sang and danced with us through the mountains. I'm sure we had more fun than anyone else thanks to the delightful boys of HSJ (in fact other trekkers would come and join our spontaneous parties!) It will be hard to top singing and dancing at over 3200m with 360 degree views in the Annapurna ranges! Thank you boys!Notes: Pack a small overnight bag for the rafting night; put it in your main luggage where it is easy to take out later in the day. If you don't want to use bottled water on the trek, ask for the safe drinking water refills available at most stops. Make time for the Everest flight!"

FOOD OPTIONS ARE LIMITED EVERYWHERE DUE TO LOCATION BUT ON A USER PAY basis there was plenty of choices at reasonable prices, you will love the garlic soup by end the trip, goid for ams. The tour leader and porters were all great and helpful and quietly funny i miss them writing thisoverall the tour was great, a small size of 8 was awsesome and everyone interacted great, even laughed at my jokes when struggling for air whilst treking, ha ha the porters worked so hard always smiling even carring 30 kg up step hills or sliding down snow covered tracks ( we got caught in snow blizzard one in 20 year pheonemon) The farewell dinner was great, with food provided best in nepal and best of all paid by the ever thoughtful ram, the man pulling all the strings, he is very approachable considerate and well organised, helped us with tours pre and post tour at good prices. Tip allow 2 or 3 days end in case wether problems, if no issue take the cheap option to rhinos in chitwan nat park awsemome exp.As i said do it you wont regret we didnt even falling three kms/ hours dshort od ebc bloody snow never liked the stuff, not good with boubon either( dont drink whikst ascending) save for down hill ENJOY !!!!!"

Alexandra had joined with Ram Sapkota\u2019s Himalayan Social to organise a 12-day holiday that inspired, thrilled, moved and exhausted me.Ram is old school and by that I mean his word is his bond \u2013 if you are lucky enough to meet the man \u2013 who donates 10% of his profits to community projects \u2013 you will understand. Meeting him was not a problem either because he made sure he was there to see us off on the first morning of the holiday and there to take us for a cultural meal on the last night before personally seeing me to my ride to the airport for my return home.The Himalayan Social guide looking after us was Bishnu and the porter was Binod. Over the next 12 days I quickly came to realise that we had been blessed because they were without a shadow of a doubt the best most personable friendly knowledgeable team out of those that we met on the trek looking after other groups. Not only that but when the guides got together to provide some Nepalese folk singing and dancing it was clear that Bishnu was the best dancer on the mountain.I have had a regular yoga practice for 2-3 years now at a yoga centre where teachers come and go but only the best survive. Alexandra would have no trouble making herself a permanent fixture at any yoga centre that was lucky enough to benefit from her patronage.Her Yoga instruction is excellent, so much so that she had the Bishnu & Binon accomplishing poses it took me a year to master (and I\u2019m using the word master loosely).This was her second year doing the trekking / yoga tour and it was obvious that she was there because she has fallen in love with the country and the people and has taken Ram\u2019s charitable causes to her heart.I have said a lot about the people because by the end of the holiday I felt I we had all bonded as friends and I know if Alexandra does the tour next year she will insist on having Bishnu & Binon on her team.I would have been happy with the friendship and the spectacular scenery alone but am happy to confirm that the town hotels and the tea houses selected by Himalayan Social were to a very good standard often providing a standard of service / accommodation & facilities that exceeded my expectations. Throw in the city guided tours and you have what is a fantastic holiday at unbelievable value for money.So if you are thinking of booking a holiday through Himalayan Social or through Alexandra \u2013 do not worry, you will be in excellent hands."

From initial booking to leaving Nepal nothing was too much trouble, great service, friendly staff who are there to help in any way. Itinerary was full and varied and provided a true insight into Nepali life. Loved every minute and laughed till we cried. Great food especially for vegetarians and accommodation was generally good.

            "review": "Explore the Nepal - Wonderful Experience!. The \"Explore the Nepal\" tour is one with a taste of various aspects of Nepal and life in Nepal.The taste included a bit of trekking (2 days) along with rafting, elephant safari, walk through the jungle, rummaging around Kathmandu and Pokhara, and exploring and gaining insights into Nepali history and culture by way of visiting various temples and sights as well as being enlightened by knowledgeable guides and locals. During this tour we also had a number of opportunities to see the whole or parts of the Himalayan ranges - the best viewing point was Chisapani from where we had a view of all of the Himalayas (and what a breathtaking sight it was).Whilst I went during the monsoon season, I was not hampered by it in the slightest. In fact, there was plenty of sunshine and, if there was any rain, it occured either towards the end of the day or at night.I would highly recommend HSJ to assist with any tours in the region as they are helpful and professional from the get go with all questions answered prior to and during the tour. Ram and his team went beyond the required in order to ensure that the best experience possible was had by all.My experience in Nepal was a memorable one and I will most definitely be returning with HSJ's assistance."

From the moment I booked the the trip to Annapurna Base Camp, to being dropped off at Kathmandu airport, Ram and the guys at HSJ were incredibly helpful and made an already great experience even better. I loved the 10 days trekking and the guide and porters were very knowledgable, helpful and fun (especially learning how to play Nepali card games). I am already thinking about the next trip back to Nepal and would go straight back to HSJ, as the trip was seamlessly executed and theres the added benefit of supporting Ram with his charitable work around Nepal."

Service was great, pick-up was on-time and we had a great guide (Bishnu) with good friends aka porter -Raju/Biswan. We trekked about 7 days around Annapurnas Circuit. During the trek Bishnu was very helpful and ensure our trip enjoyable. He had full knowledge of local cultures and areas and who really knows where to find the best food in town. Thanks to Bishnu, he helped us to meet local people / school children\u2019s and to share some good times of their lives. He made us feel like family the entire time we were there. Unfortunately weather was not very good but we knew that it was not a best time for trekking (early August). May be one day we will be back again for ABC trek. It is a totally awesome experience. we want to thanks Ram and his team especially Bishnu/Raju/Biswan who was with us for 2 weeks for an amazing adventure. Segar Rajoo (Kuala Lumpur"

            "review": "2 week rafting, trekking, and Chitwan tour - excellent!. We spent 2 weeks with Himalayan Social Journey in Nepal, and they were fantastic. We were met at the airport by Binod Dhakal, who was our guide for the entire trip, and escorted back to our hotel in Thamel, Kathmandu. After a day of escorted sightseeing around Kathmandu, we were taken by bus for some rafting, and then on to Chitwan National Park. Here we were taken elephant riding (we saw a rhino!), got to bathe an elephant, and also see the elephant breeding centre. After Chitwan we headed up to Pokhara for the trekking, where we were to do the Poon Hill circuit. This again was excellent, porters had been hired so we only needed to carry small day rucksacks. The scenery was incredible, and we were as usual very well looked after by Binod and the team of porters, who were all very friendly. Accommodation was in the trekking lodges, which were basic, but clean and comfy.Binod was excellent throughout the trip. He was always available to deal with any queries, and did his best to sort out any problems that occurred. From taking us shopping on our first day in Kathmandu to make sure we had the right trekking gear, to waiting behind and looking after the slowest member of our party when trekking, or making sure we each had a bag of salt to ward off leeches, the level of care he provided was fantastic. He is clearly a very experienced guide, and knew all the tricks like placing your breakfast order at the trekking lodges the night before, so you don't have to wait for breakfast. He always made sure we knew what was happening, and was very patient when dealing with everyone in our trekking group.Ram, the owner of HSJ, is also able to organise additional activities such as para-gliding or an Everest flight. We did the para-gliding in Pokhara, which was brilliant, a really nice way to see the lake. The only complaint we could make about HSJ would be regarding the booking of the para-gliding, where it became clear that Ram was charging us significantly more for the activity than if we booked directly through the para-gliding company, which we eventually did. Would advise anyone planning to do any of the additional activities to check the prices first, do avoid any misunderstandings."

I came across HSJ through Groupon Indonesia and contacted them directly since my trip schedule was slightly shorter than the promo. I ended up getting a very good price for a tailor-made program for our short stay in Nepal. Communication with Ram, the owner, prior to our arrival was very smooth with super quick replies. He also agreed to book us at the hotel we wanted in Kathmandu and his choice of hotel in Pokhara was also good. He proposed several ideas during our stay and gave a good price (for example on mountain flight). His staffs were professional and friendly; private cars were comfortable enough for the long drive (but the driver was always super careful! I felt safe all the time on the road). At the end of our stay we felt more like a family than just guest. Thanks for making our first trip to Nepal memorable, Ram! Looking forward to coming again to Nepal soon!"

Although I did find it hard to get responses to my emails prior to the trip regarding transportation, weather, supplies, if there are others in the group...I would say if those things are important to you that you remain persistent because these are things that could make or break your trip. I did meet a fellow that ended up having to do the trek with just a porter when he arrived after thinking he signed up to be with a group. There was also a small hiccup when I arrived and no one was there to pick me up from the airport. I had never gotten a response from my emails as to what hotel I'd be staying at so I had no idea where to even take a taxi to...so that was a tad stressful. But the porters and guides are insanely polite and charismatic and completely made up for any or all discrepancies. I loved all the time we were able to spend with them. They made sure to show everyone a good time and are just completely genuine people. I would highly recommend hiring a guide and porter if you are considering a trek, especially through this agency. Do some legwork on your own if you are a solo trekker like me and make sure to email all questions before hand so you get what you're looking for :)"

Nepal is an amazing place to visit and if you go you must book with Himalayan Social Journey. Ram has lived in the US and very much understands the needs of Western travellers plus he is leading an Education program in a Nepal village.

We booked with Himalayan Social journey on a budget package (we are often 5 star travellers)for 15 days of rafting, jungling and trekking (+ some Kathmandhu highlights thrown in). My husband and I joined 3 other people and a couple of different guides for a varied trip of Nepal. Highlights are as follows:-- Rafting down the river (grade 2-3 rapids) - huge amount of fun - followed by sleeping in safari style tents and watching the traffic on one of the craziest roads in the world- Venturing into the jungle and getting up close and personal with elephants, crocodiles, monkeys, white rhino, wild boar (plus seeing quite a few tiger footprints but alas no tigers)- Trekking for 5 days - accomodation on this leg was basic but super clean. All of the lodges had great facilities out of hours - food/drinks/card tables (hot water was a bit hit and miss). The views of the Annapurna mountains were unforgettable and on some days the steps were unforgiving (one day I counted 6500 steps) so not for the faint hearted and there is no alternate path - although you could probably pay to get a helicopter to bypass for a lot of cash! The people, donkeys, horses, children asking for candy were plentiful and definitely added to the experience of the trek.- Kathmandu - checked out lots of stupas, old cities, rug weaving community and some decent food.Our porters Binod (Binod 2) and Kristyna did an amazing job of playing the flute, laughing and carrying on not to mention carrying 20+ kilos each. Special mention goes to our guide for his attention and care throughout the trip - Big Thanks Binod - for such a young guide you really did an awesome job! No detail was too much, no hill too great when Binod was around.Ram - the owner oversaw every detail - his energy and enthusiasm (whilst not unique in Nepal) definitely puts him in a class of his own. He understands Westerners very well having lived overseas for several years, but it is his energy and enthusiasm that make Himalayan Social Journey what it is and make his team want to work there.Overall other comments - Nepal is a basic country in many ways, yet there are highlights around most corners if you look. The people have a great command of English, are super friendly, live in an extremely basic way, yet look well presented, neat & tidy all the time. They have a strong respect for their religion (yet it is not in your face), the souvenirs are incredibly good value and plentiful (from metal work, to woodwork, Gemstones, cashmere, clothes, rugs ...), The scenery outside of Kathmandhu constantly changes and has a raw beauty. Kathmandhu itself is a little crazy like most Asian capitals. It is currently in the middle of widening most of it's city's roads so looks a little like a war zone, and this makes it slow going. It is worth spending a few days in Kathmandhu with a good guide or a good handbook and looking for the treasures that this city has to offer. The rug weaving by the Tibetan community was a highlight for me and the rugs will be a treasured memory of a unique time in a unique place.Thanks to all - we had a great time."

WELL...the beautiful staff of Himalayan Social Journey made this exciting expedition absolutely perfect.We had never been to Nepal before but longed to see the the dramatic peaks seen from Kathmandu Valley and meet some of the beautiful Nepalese. Our group of 15 was mostly Kiwis and Australians and we all were able to trek along each day according to our ability. Some ran ahead while slower ones followed behind, with everyone accompanied by helpful porters. These young men carried our huge packs without complaint and always with smiles and songs to share. They were just incredible! The quaint and simple lodgings along the trek were owned mostly by smiling, happy people too. The abundant supply of dal bhat and other pasta or rice dishes kept us energised (the local saying was, \"Dal bhat power - 24 hour!\") and we all marvelled in the joy that emanated from those who had absolutely nothing. The very poorest seemed most jubilant of all. We thought it a beautiful life lesson to take home with us.Our lodgings at Kathmandu and Pokhara were a nice standard, and we found some favourite dishes (chilli vegetarian momo was primo) and Everest Beer to enjoy in both places. We had Camel Paks in our daypacks and also had bought a six-pack of toilet paper in Kathmandu, which saw us nicely through the whole trek.Two good ideas would be to bring a couple of long strings of nylon cord and a zip lock bag of detergent. We washed our clothes in sinks as we went along and hung things to dry or wore them on our day packs until they dried. The very best thing we purchased before the trip was a Steripen. It cost a little over $100 but is much better than putting chlorine tablets into water. We used our Steripen (which utilises UV light to steralise water) even in bottled water. It ensured we never got sick and our water was always 99% pure. You'd think you could fill up your water carrier with stream water but we laughed on one occasion where we were all riding on a bus up a hill and saw a clear stream running next to the road with a woman washing her clothes, then further up the road a child was pooping into it! Chlorine tablets taste awful too. The Steripen ensures water keeps its usual taste. There are a few occasions where you are able to only buy water from a lodge's filtered supply. You will absolutely not want to trust your stomachs to that water! Steripen to the rescue again!If you're looking at buying souvenirs, wait until your return to Kathmandu. The little shops have everything you'd find on the trek but at a cheaper price. We hope you have the opportunity to reserve a trek that has some yoga classes in Kathmandu. We had never tried yoga before (and are largely inflexible) but absolutely loved our time with Yogi. He encouraged us to think about how we approach life and let us know how we could find the joy in every day. It was a beautiful way to start each day which made the experience in Nepal so much richer. Our next trip to Nepal will absolutely be with Ram and Himalayan Social Journey.

So I mainly didn't want to have to worry about anything practical. And with the Himalayan social journey everything was taken care of perfectly. Before the trip my emails were answered very fast and very clear. I could feel that Ram was paying attention to my needs and organizing our trip from that. And also for a good price compared to the others I was in touch with.On the trip everything ran so smoothly, we \"just\" had to walk. Our guide Binod was really letting us feel like it is our trip and he is also a very nice and friendly person."

We experienced Nepal and hiked the Annapurna Circuit during the first two weeks of November, 2012. Everything was taken care of from the start, from lodgings, to transportation. We didn't have to worry about anything. During the trek, the crew went out of their way to make us feel comfortable by singing, playing instruments, and just overall being silly for our enjoyment; AND they did all of this while carrying our packs! We are still singing the songs we learned on the trek. We will never forget you, Ram, and would highly recommend this trip to anyone willing to work hard for some fantastic views and the adventure that comes along with that!"

Fortunately our tour was handed over to him due to overbooking by another tour company and thankfully so as Ram was extremely caring and considerate that our every comfort or need was met both on the trek and in Pokhara and Kathmandu. Ram's group of porters were quite frankly the kindest, considerate, polite young men who would ever want to meet - not really speaking much of each others language was never a problem and they are so proud of their country and heritage, their entertainment during the trek and of an evening with their dancing, music and singing is still such a great memory.

Ram, who is the owner, is always smiling and happy and this made it very easy to deal with him. He puts no pressure on you, just gives you the outlines and all the details and lets you choose. They were very helpful and the prices really reasonable. We decided Everest Base Camp Trek would be our chosen journey, and follow in some of the footsteps of our kiwi fellow Sir Edmund Hillary. The flight was all arranged by the company and the transfer to the airport. Our guide Bisnu was amazing!! He lives in the Khumbu region, so you are really supporting local people. He had a great knowledge of the mountain ranges and kept us at ease with any questions we had. All accomadation was booked and organised by Bisnu and the company.We trekked for 11 days up to Kala Pattar and back down, the most memorable experience of our life, seeing that gian mountain Everest is unforgettable!After the trek we also organised through Himalayan Social Journey trekking to go down to Chitwan, where we had three days, two nights organised for us. With bus fares, accomadation, elephant riding, jungle walking all included and organised. Very fun and cultural!My husband and I love the fact that some of the proceeds goes to local charity projects as well.Would reccommend this company to anyone!

I didn't Himalayan Social Journey was so highly rated on Trip Advisor,until after I had chosen to engage them.I could quickly see why somany people are pleased with the services Ram\u2019s company has to offer.I chose to trek with Himalayan Social Journey because they were themost responsive to my emails and many little queries, patiently. I wasvery impressed with the prompt and efficient responses. I felt that Iwould be in good hands in Nepal, and indeed, that was so.We did the Poon Hill trek, and included white water rafting and Tibettour. Himalayan Social Journey designed the itinerary according to theactivities we wanted to do, and there were no slip ups. We were alsoreally pleased with the guide Binod and porter Hari, for they weresuch great company! We had many pleasant conversations along the trekwith them, and other trekkers, and were quite sad that we did such ashort trek! As hard as it was for us, the encouragement of our guideand porters and patience was very nice to see. We wished we did alonger trek for we truly had much fun!Ram gives his clients really good personal attention, and met us fordinner - the Nepali cultural show. Its really nice to meet with such amotivated and ambitious person who is truly making a difference in theindustry. I believe he has one of the most comprehensive programmesand there are loads of activities you can choose to do with HimalayanSocial Journey - there is even a charity trek.Truly enjoyed it, and I could not had asked for more. I intend to goback, and will certainly engage Himalayan Social Journey again becauseI do trust that they can do a good job, and they give the assurancethat you need in a foreign country."

We had a lovely time with our sherpa's who were great characters, made us feel very welcome and were always up for a sing, dance and a clap around the fire at night - and let's not forget the amazing flute sessions! Apart from the incredible sights, hospitality and adventure we experienced, what impressed us most was the length that Ram and his staff would go to help us out or organise something special! The team always came up with the goods - even once providing a surprise birthday cake in the mountains! We made great friends on the trip and when we go back to Nepal we will definately contact Ram and the team to catch up!! I couldn't recommend this tour highly enough - if you want to go to Nepal, I urge you to experience it with Ram and his team - you wont regret it!Namaste!!!!!"

They took care of everything, even took us shopping to make sure we had the right gear for our trip with us to make sure we were warm and comfortable in the cold Himalayas. He organised a lovely Birthday party for one of the girls in our group. Ram is funny always happy and smiling and makes sure the atmosphere is good in the group. He took very good care of us and make sure we had an amazing trip. His guides and porters were truely beautful people who touched our hearts very deeply. They played music, sang for us and didnt want to stop dancing. Thank you again Ram that you and your team gave me an unforgettable beautiful experience in Nepal!!!! Hope to do another trip with you soon."

            "review": "Ram is an honest, hard-working entrepreneur who tries to give you the best holiday. Ram organized a trek for my wife and I into the Everest region as well as a few days of sightseeing in Kathmandu. Based on our experience, Ram was very responsive, transparent and did his best to do what we asked.He was very responsive before the trip in terms of organizing our itinerary, insurance, etc. And during our trip he changed our itinerary a few times on our request as bad weather and flight cancellations put our original plans to ruin. When it really mattered - when we were stuck in the mountains in very bad weather and my wife came down with altitude sickness and a virus - he came through for us.While not everything went like clockwork, keep in mind this is Nepal and the standards are not like other countries. Things do go wrong and Ram cannot control everything. He does however always tries his best and works hard to give you the best trip possible and is very reasonably priced.One point of potential confusion: Himalayan Social Journey's website is www.nepalsocial.com.np. There is another, different company called Nepal Social journey who is also run by a Ram, a common name in Nepal."

We lost one of our bags at the airport and he organised everything so we got it back. The trekking was one of the best experiences we've ever had, the porters were so sweet and when our tour was over we were staying in Nepal for 3 more days, they took us around Nepal on their own time. I really recommend the yoga program that was incorporated, really intense but amazing. Ram is a very dynamic personality who will make you laugh a lot and his staff are the best."

Ram and his team were so patient and flexible making our trip worth every minute of it. The first day we went trekking and unfortunately I fell after 6 hours of walking. As we arrived to the lodge where we were suppose to rest, it was very clear to me that I wouldn\u2019t be able to continue trekking the second day as it was planned. The guide came in tremendous help altering all the plans we had and supplying us with a car that would drive us back the city. To our shock, the actual drive back was an adventure in itself; it was more like a safari. The following days were planned perfectly to accommodate my injury and Ram was Cooperative and understanding all the way. This trip is the best adrenaline rush I ever had and it\u2019s all due to Ram and his team."

Ram and his team coordinated all events professionally, timely, and very reasonable cost. Ram's arrival dinner and departure dinner gathering was great. Although the weather did not cooperate in the mountains Ram arranged for alternative experiences including white water rafting. When my son and I go back we will use Himalayan Social Journey. The company's ability to arrange everything and fit everbody's budget request is be far the best I have experienced. I highly recommend Ram's company."

            "review": "Ram's company is the most reliable in Thamel - amazing adventures!. I have travelled to Nepal many times and even lived there for a spell. On my first visit in 2008, I travelled to the Everest range with Himalayan Social Journey Trekking, Ram Sapkota's company. Ram and I got along instantly and the level of professionalism and organization is unparalleled by any other trekking company in Thamel, Kathmandu. Ram has since organized all of my trips in or around the country. From Tibet to Bhutan - from Chitwan to Annapurna - Ram has been solid and consistent, ensuring that everything that I need is at my disposal. His company is also extremely reliable for emergency situations. Ram makes sure that he has all of your insurance information available before you go into the high mountains in the event that he needs to call a helicopter to extract you (he has done it many times before) - I found that reassuring. On my latest trip in September 2011, Ram organized for a climbing buddy and myself to climb Island Peak in the Everest Range. From the moment I landed in Kathmandu to the moment I stood on top of the mountain - Ram arranged for everything. His company is one that you'll come back to - and his guides will become like companions on your journey."

Great fun with Ram and his company!Me and my husband did an amazing trekking to the Annapurna circuit organized by the Himalaya Social Journey. We checked many agencies in Thamel and on internet before deciding for it. The prices are highly competitive and the staff is competent and english speaking. We definitely recommend HSJ for organizing your trekking!"

I organized several trips with HSJ, Tibet, Chitwan, Pokhara and Everest Base Camp: I always received a great service and for a great price compared to the other agencies in the area. I also visited the village where the projects of the NGO are implemented and I strongly recommend it as experience. Back to Italy and I am now organizing a fun rising for the NGO as I strongly believe in it. The HSJ leader is a great guy, Ram, and he very useful also from home to organize your trip. He answers to the email in less then 24 hours and he his a all knowing person about nepal, tibet and bhutan. If you are going to Nepal, don't miss it."

I was looking forward to a great time hiking on the Himalayas, and left everything on their hands, and they did super. All the tour and travel practicalities were taken care of by them, and during the trek, our main job was to walk and talk to our guide and porters. ... ! The owner, Ram is reliable person. Beside this, I am in touched with his spirituality behaviour . Without a doubt, I would take this trip again with them any time."
