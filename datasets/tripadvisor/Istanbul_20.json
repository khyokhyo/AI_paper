            "review": "A Turkish Versailles . You can get there on foot from Taqsim sq if you enjoy a pleasant walk through nice and quiet area and don't mind some steps through a park down toward the palace .The entrance fee was 40 Turkish lira per person to visit the whole complex however you can choose to visit the main building only and pay less.The main palace was kept and maintained in a very good condition. Beautiful interior design and architecture all over the main palace, magnificent candelabra and ornaments were placed every where. the Haram area ( residential part for king's mother and his wives) was not that much interesting except in few rooms ( reminded me of Kensington palace! ) The entire visit was arranged by a mandatory tour guide with option for English and Arabic speaking guide. Our English guide for the main palace was very nice and funny man. He was knowledgeable and tried to interact with different group of visitors. In contrast to him a lady guide for the haram was not that much good, she briefly talked about the whole thing and let us to visit the rest of place by our own. It is not possible to visit the main building by your own, photography is not allowed inside of any buildings. The camli kosk which looked like a posh conservatory was very average , there was a long corridor from the main palace to there which was blocked for visitors but we had a sneaky look through the closed doors. It was interesting! The watch museum was very average nothing very special. The was an aviary near the building with few birds which we felt there were a little bit neglected in their cages as the area was very smelly.There was cafe outside the exit door of the haram with no view. So if you prefer a nice view by the sea there is another cafe just outside the main entrance door. We really enjoyed our visit and definitely recommend it. You won't miss out that much if you visit only the main palace."

However, once you have passed the main gate you immediately see a fine estate which was created by many craftsmen. The details in architecture and design are truly everywhere. The Ottoman Empire brought some very fine skills and capabilities."

We joined a tour with an english speaking guide who was very knowledgeable of the details in the palace. The palace has a marvelous view on the Bosphour. It is a huge palace. It is very easy to arrive from Taksim square by taking Funicular F1 to Kabatas then can walk to the palace in around 10 mins. A must see place in Istanbul. You have to buy tickets for the main palace and another ticket for the Harem. In my opinion the Harem is simpler and there's nothing much to see so you can skip it."

Kind of a last hurrah before they called it a day and got exiled. You can only visit as part of a guided tour but its well worth it, even though you may feel a little rushed sometimes. The guides make sure you don't linger too long. I don't like the \"no picture\" policy and quite a few tourists seemed to be blatantly ignoring the guide's pleas to not use cameras. The room where Ataturk died is in the palace. The grand finale of the palace tour is the HUGE ceremonial hall - I believe its larger than 20,000 square feet! Worth visiting and after you've seen the main buildings, venture out to the back where there is a little clock museum and a duck pond."

Make time for it! The last home of the Ottoman rulers and the home of Ataturk when he founded modern Turkey, the Dolmabahce Palace is impressive in every way. The palace affords visitors a glimpse into the architectural splendor that surrounded the Ottoman royal family. The palace also affords visitors a chance to walk through history, to see the rooms occupied by Ottoman royals as well as the rooms where Ataturk, the Father of the Republic of Turkey worked and died in 1938, with the palace's clocks stopped at the time of his death. For sheer beauty, there are few sights comparable to the elegant Dolmabahce Palace on the edge of the Bosphorus between European and Asian Turkey. A must see!"

Perfect setting on the Bosphorus with beautiful grounds as well as the palace. 5 minutes easy walk from the end of the T1 tram line. It's compulsory to be led by the tour guide. Some of the large group we found ourselves in had poor manners - taking photos even when told not to (several times), touching things on the way round, talking so we could not hear the guide. At least a few of the group were trying to \"shush\" the culprits. Perhaps many couldn't understand English - it was an English-speaking guided tour. There seemed to be just English and Turkish tour choices at the time we were there."

I had visited Istanbul and done all the \u201cimportant\u201d sites but really wanted to visit Dolmabache \u2013 the setting of this palace is absolutely stunning, the building is itself a work of art. The interiors are amazing and the crystal staircase must have looked stunning when it was installed \u2013 I say \u201cmust have\u201d as it looked to me that it had not been cleaned since the day it was installed, the whole purpose of it would have been to stun visitors with the shimmering stairs but sadly the whole palace smelt of dust and dirt and clearly none of the wonderful treasures had ever been cleaned. Here you have an incredible palace built to underline the Sultan\u2019s power at a time when it was waning with incredible contents all presented in a rather poor and uninspired manner \u2013 the threadbare carpets (the ones specifically put down for you to walk on) alone show the lack of interest in this building and the fact that less than a third of it is open to the public is another indicator. The Turks are really missing a trick here, where the treasures of Topkapi, the blue mosque and Hagi Sophia are wonderful, Dolmabache is on an equal footing and certainly needs considerable more attention to presentation. You do need a guide with this palace to get inside, there were a number of Asian tourists all trying to tag on to a tour as they found having purchased a ticket they couldn\u2019t actually go inside without a guide \u2013 my guide was very firm in telling them that it was a private tour and they could not be admitted as part of it. I\u2019m not really sure what the rationale behind it is and perhaps it should be made clear when purchasing the ticket but certainly best to book with a guide if you want to see the inside. Also no photography is allowed and one of the guards was most emphatic and quite aggressive to another tour group when one of their members took a photo. All in all really worth the visit"

The painting museum wing exhibition was impressive as well. However, the harem portion of the tour was a joke. If youre waiting for the timed English language tour...youll be accompanied by masses of locals and non English speakers ( it was a weekend visit). Youll be moved through the castle interior in a fast cattle like fashion with only 2 or so brief English speaking explanations. Everything is basically roped off lijiting access but you will get a glimpse into various rooms which are obviously dated and not kept up because no one has lived there since President Attaturk has passed away there in the 50's. I would also not really bother checkibg out the crystal exhibition ( very limited and primitive) and the clock museum ( unless you're really into that type of thing)."

The chandeliers are truely stunning and the furniture you walk by (very briskly) is also beautiful. There are many dark carved chests inlaid with mother of pearl designs. You can only go through on a guided tour, and they are offered in English and Turkish. The most interesting part of the palace to me was the Harem side, which is where the royal families lived. The setup of each wife having their own apartment is fascinating. I wish that we had been able to see a full unit, with the kitchen and servants quarters as well, to get a feel for how they actually lived in their space. The exteriors of the palace are worth the ticket price alone, as it's a beautiful location right on the Bosphorus, you can imagine the royal family accessing the property by boat after an excursion to the Black Sea."

It has world's heaviest FANOOS in the main guest lounge, which still used by turkey government for hosting foreign delegations.However, one can feel sympathy with the offsprings of ottoman empire, as this is their ancestors property but they can't get any benefit from it, instead the govt is earning money from it, ie the ottoman empire is still feeding the turkey.

Whereas Topkapi shows the Ottoman royal culture during its peak, Dolmabace is the palace where the royal family moved to towards the end of the empire and is modelled on western design. The interior is fabululous and the location is right on the waterfront and has great views across the Bosphorus. The gardens are also quite beautiful. It is easy to reach by metro and after the visit you can take the funicular to Taksim square and then stroll down the famous Istiklal Avenue right down to the Galata Tower. Highly recommended!"

Ataturk was the last occupant and he died here in the early 1900's using the Palace as a summer residence.Its very oppulent with lots of gold and crystal and holds one of the worlds largest crystal chandelier weighing over 4.5 tonnes!

A majestic palace with a splendid garden all around,its garden looks on Bosphorus,what an amazing view.TherE are HARIM section ,selamlik section and a museum .There will be a tour guide speaking English that will be included in entrance fee you pay,the tour in harim and selamlik section will take about one hour.Most things I liked was selamlik section with the THRONE HALL,The wonderful Crystal Chandelier and the Crystal Stairs,when a draught of air entered, the crystal pieces will give a sound like a music ,I loved it.The description we got from the guide was good .You had better visit this palace and enjoy the garden views."

I would suggest you visit this attraction in the morning since crowds gather around afternoon. There is a small entrance fee to pay but really affordable. The palace is regal with a very rich history. A 45-60 minute tour also takes place inside the palace where a guide tells you more about the interior, structure & past leaders of Turkey that have stayed there."

Hence when in Istanbul take a trip in the past to the Ottoman Era and visit the 19th century's most glamorous palaces in the world Dolmabahce Palace! In our visit last year we give the Palace a miss simply because it was not on our guided tour itinerary which is surprising since after witnessing the opulence of the Palace in our recent private trip it's a must visit. Although we think the reason is that the other sites in Istanbul like Ayasofya, Topkap\u0131 Palace, Blue Mosque & others are relatively cheap ticket wise as they have a package deal but Dolmabahce for one is located at the far end and it is in an up market area of Istanbul plus the ticket price is steep so to include it in a tour package might be heavy on an average tourist. All said we do recommend the traveller to visit the Palace simply because it is magnificent. The sprawling gardens, the European coastline of the Bosphorus stretching from miles and miles, the grandeur of the exterior grounds of the palace and once inside your jaw will certainly drop because all that glitters is gold! One is not allowed to take pictures of the interiors but it is a guided tour so you may get lost in the opulence of Dolmabahce but its historical importance and facts are not lost in translation.... (English translator available who was quite a jolly good fellow)."

Visited 15th July 2016 - It's clear why the last sultan lived in this Palace, as the design combines eclectic elements from the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical styles, blended with traditional Ottoman architecture to create a new synthesis. Dolmabache is a must-see attraction to learn about Turkish history, design and also admire the beauty of the palace and it's surrounding garden (there is also a Bird aviary). I recommend getting there early between 9am-10am, to avoid the queues and herd of tourists. Also there is cap on the number of guests/visitors the palace can host per day & consider the palace is closed every Monday and Thursday to avoid disappointment. The Palace is divided in two parts: Northern (Harem) and Southern (Selamlik) Wing which offer guided complementary tours in English and Turkish. Note no photos are permitted inside these wings. Prior to venturing in the palace, I recommend enjoy a tea or snack at the Dolmache restaurant as it is worth the visit not only for the views of the Bosphorus but for menu & the value for money.

Go ahead and get tix for both tours, the main palace and the harem rooms ($40TL). Note no photography of any kind is allowed inside. The whole of it really comes down to the harem room where Ataturk died and the jaw dropping main hall, which was as impressive as it gets. Also, as far as one can make comparisons via the rearview mirror of history, I think the last sultans and rulers made a mistake going with the modern Dolmabache Palace, because I prefer Topkapi Palace by far."

These only allow access to the ground floor.My very big issue with visiting this Palace should visitors not be of Turkish nationality is that Entry costs for Turkish Citizens is 20tl and entry for Foreigners is 40tl. At all other tourist attractions that I am aware of in Turkey the entry cost is the same regardless of nationality, religion, colour etc. This is the way it should be. Everyone equal.Surprisingly this Palace is not operated by the usual department for Culture & Tourism, but is in fact a Government run attraction. They need urgently correct this overcharging and discriminatory behaviour.Until such time I recommend to boycott this attraction & find alternative Palaces to visit. There are many."

Although heavy rain started after our arrival and some what spoilt our day as there is little to no shelter. Once inside on the guided tour we appreciated the wait and the weather did not spoil our experience, it was terrific. This Palace was the last built by the Ottomans The last Sultan built it to show the Empire was not fading. No expense was spared the Chandaliers were magnificent, the largest weighed 4 Tonnes. Cost to enter was reasonable I think it was less than $20.00 Australia. The guided tours were done in English or Turkish, we were in a large group so it was necessary to keep near the Guide to hear what was being said. It has an advantage over Versailles as it was not looted after the Sultans were moved out. A must see in Istanbul, Security was high"

Dolmabahce is much more Western in its architecture and it is very grand and opulent. Dolmabahce has great water views because it is right on the Bosphorus. The interior is stunning, with lots of gold and the most amazing chandeliers. Sadly, they don't let you take pictures inside. Besides the main palace you also have the Crystal Pavilion (small but neat), a small clock museum (neat) and the paintings gallery (not that hot in my opinion). The Swan Fountain is lovely. Lots of birds running around and a tiny zoo by the Crystal Pavilion too.Getting in: 40 TL combo ticket for Selamlik and Harem. 9-3:30 daily but CLOSED MONDAY AND THURSDAY. We had to wait a few minutes to get an English-speaking tour, but I think it helped that we got there shortly after the Palace opened for the day. The wait would surely have been longer if more people were there."

Please note that if it is a hot day outside, it's going to be even hotter inside in the upper floors as it is stuffy and there is no A/C. As this was the case the day we visited.

You have 2 guided tours for the main 2 parts of the palace! You have to wait for about 20 minutes for the tour but the garden is so amazing that you will even want to wait more so that you can take all the photos you want!!! To visit the entire palace, it costs 40 turkish lira, this includes the other museums within the palace area! Loved it!"

Unfortunately, you can't take pictures or videos on the inside of the palace (that applies to all of the palaces), but there were people secretly taking pictures which I can understand. Obviously they are tourists so why wouldn't they want some sort of memory. The issue we had with the palace visits is that you have to go in with a group tour which means you have to wait for the tours to start. So if it's sunny outside like it was when we went you have to stand in line for about 20 minutes. Dolmabahce is closed on Monday and Thursday and is open the rest of the week from 9-4. The fee to go in is 30 TL/ $10 for the official/administrative part of the palace and 20 TL/just under $7 for the private chambers. You can buy a combined ticket for 40 TL wich is about $13.3."

Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace was built in the 1840s and 1850s for Sultan Abd\u00fcl Mecid I, who tired of residing in Topkapi Palace and decided to move to another palace on the shores of the Bosphorus. Dolmabah\u00e7e, being constructed in the 19th century after the heyday of the Ottoman state and its architecture, is much more clearly influenced by European styles than its predecessors. It is largely in the Baroque style, and is as much defined by right angles and rational, even divisions as the earlier Ottoman structures are characterized by curves and extravagances. The Palace does still incorporate aspects of traditional Ottoman architecture, but these influences are much more prevalent in the organization of the house and the manner in which it still accommodated a traditional Turkish, rather than Western, lifestyle. It was furnished with Western chandeliers and furniture, but still had a rich collection of Turkish rugs. The Palace was used by the royal family as its official residence until the proclamation of the Republic in 1923, when it became the Presidential Summer Palace and a residence for Turkey\u2019s first President, Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. It was here that he died in 1923. It is now a museum that is open to the public."

The tour was quick moving and lasted about a half hour. Don't miss (not that you could) the massive 4.5 ton chandelier in the huge ballroom. The palace sits right on the shores of the Bosporus and has beautiful grounds, as well as separate clock and crystal museums (included in the price of admission. It is a very short distance from the embarkation point for some of the Bosporus cruises.

Once you enter the place, immerse yourself in super-rich artistic beauty, infrastructure of the palace. Do take a guided tour and see how Sultan lived his life and harem section. This palace is also a must visit for architecture buffs who would be interested to know how lighting was taken care of in the palace when there was no electricity. Adequate mirrors to reflect sunlight to other rooms and so on. Since it is located on sea-side, amazing photo opportunities. Lastly they also explain how Ataturk stayed in the palace after Ottoman Empire. PLease give yourself atleast 2 hours to visit this palace."

We were pleased that we had not chosen to see everything on the grounds as we wanted to see the harem and palace which exceeded expectations. We did not think we missed out by not buying the more expensive tickets. From sultanahmet if you like to walk head over the galatea bridge. We followed signs towards the university and it wasn't far from there . It is a good hour walk. Otherwise take the tram from sultanahmet to kabata for 4turkish lira (for a jeton or token)"

If you plan on getting there early, do not arrive before 9am, because the first English tour starts at 9am even thought the doors open at 8:30. You can't look around by yourself, you have to stick to a group which they will assign. I highly recommend visiting the Topkapi palace prior to the Dolmabache Palace. You can also check out the Aviary and a small clock museum on the way to the harem in the complex."

You would think that this grandeur is a display of the wealth of the empire but no. It is what is called a mirror-move. The empire is falling apart and to conceal this, the Dolmabah\u00e7e palace was built. The reason that the sultan of this time, Abd\u00fclmecid I, built this palace was because the Topkapi palace (also worth visiting) was no longer suited for modern, 19th century government. Besides, the sultans were living at Topkapi for the last 400 years.Take a good look at the three chandeliers in the palace and also at the detail on the walls. It is absolutely marvelous. The ballroom was to me the most astonishing thing the visited, unfortunately you are not allowed to take pictures. Prices for adults are about 30 lira, or \u20ac 10. It is totally worth it I tell you. Be sure to get a tour, which I think you are obliged to do. Note: your museum card is not valid here."

At 17h you are kicked out. Its all good,if we were told that we need to see the palace first and that the last tour was given at 16h (4pm). So we saw everything else but didn't go inside the palace, as the harem tour ended 16:20. The 3 points are for the lack of instruction and info at he front door. We even asked the lady at the painting gallery and she told us about the garden closing time, but nothing about which tour should be taken first. The Harem guide was great, he spoke English and German prefect. I am sad not to have caught his name. Defiantly buy the ticket including everything (40tl).

Enormous and luxurious, reflects the magnificence of a big empire. I read some bad reviews before my second visit and i have to say the following: a)considering the size and the maintainance costs of this monument, the ticket of 12 euros is more than decent., b) a palace is a palace. If we expect to see something different, this cannot caracterize a monument as a tourist trap, c) the organisation of the staff is very good. But the visitors are so many that it is impossible not to wait until you enter. Happened exactly the same to me in Taj Mahal and Empire State Building. For me, this palace is one of Istanbul jewels and worths it to visit it!"

It was not our first choice among all the attractions in Istanbul, but at the end of our stay we had some time to spent and decided to go to Dolmabahce palace, since it was close to our hotel.We were very positively surprised, because this is one of the best attractions in Istanbul. For 40 TL (aprox. 12 EUR / 14 USD) you get 2 separate english guided tours of the palace and the harem (together 1.5h). In addition you get entrance to a clock museum and you can walk through a beautiful garden.The palace is beautiful and the guides are very informative and willing to answer al your questions.Highly recommended!"

When we reached the main gate I was really annoyed by the attitude of the staff. They arrange visitors in groups. We were in the English speaking herd!. We were rushed to catch up with the rest. More than 50 visitors following the guide. Very low voice and faraway from you. You could never hear any information.the lady in the salamlik was better than the male guide in the haramlik. He will point to an area and say e.g this is the princess private room and then he will take you to the next stip. place contents was amazing. Luxury at it,s most. Huge beautifully color coded lounges for different occasions. Crystal chandeliers from the best bohemian crystals in huge frames hanging. Damascus drapes and silk carpets in huge sizes .

I was too tired to do the Harem tour but the Official section tour revealed the magnificent opulence of the palace. A mixture of Baroque, Rococo, Victorian and Turkish. Never seen so much gold and crystal. And the final room was amazing in both its size and splendour. There is also an art gallery , cafes and a wonderful promenade between palace and Bospherous. The only downside is that the tour is a bit rushed so you don't get a lot of time in each room. But this palace is not to be missed."

Visited this palace late last year on a weekend during one of my many business trips to Istanbul.I actually enjoyed this palace more than Topkapi, but that may be due to my English perspective on life.You tour in groups with a guide ( choice of Turkish or English naration) and it takes a bit less than an hour. I think because it was winter I got the full tour for just 30TL and it wasnt crowded Even so I had to wait for about 30 minutes to join a tour.The palace was the last one built by the Ottomans and was the home of the last Sultan until the role abolished in 1922 and he was exiled. It is located by the side of the Bosphoros with views over to Asia and back towards the Old City with his previous palace in view.It is a mixture of eastern and western cultures, the Sultan clearly influenced by what was fashionable in western Europe, yet still clingimg to his traditional roots. Sometimes you feel you could be in yet another English stately home and othertimes back in the harem of Topkapi. The palace you go around, including the state or public room section and the harem is huge. Many fabulous chandeliers, pieces of furniture, art and other objects on display.The palace complex has many other buildings , some of which you can visit as well. Just walking around the outside of the buildings was extremely interesting and gives you the full feeling of how vast it is and explains how costly it was to build.If my wife accompanies me on a trip to Istanbul I will defineitely take her here."

The main room towards the end of the tour is stunning, others equally as good, fantastic building and as wonderful as most others I have seen around the world.Now the reality. We arrived early, it was quiet, it all went wrong when the staff at the ticket office indicated they could not be any less interested in us.You cannot wander freely around this palace, you must take a tour. Unfortunately our tour was regulated by the guides Facebook account...We walked in, were given a brief history and plan and were then walked very quickly along a long corridor of interesting looking rooms. I assumed we would be back to see them but, no, that was it. We were then forced around a few darkened rooms of uninteresting crockery before waiting for the rest of the group and again being marched off past more interest to more crockery. The guide spent the whole tour on his phone looking at his Facebook account, the content of which regulated the speed of our journey.To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The whole idea of what they are doing is obviously to get more people through the place but I'd have paid double to have been left alone and allowed to wander. Some of our group complained, they were ignored.The Harem was slightly better, different guide, same idea but not quite as bad. It is okay to take your time in the grounds thankfully but the real interest is within.It's one of these places you have to visit but if they made they effort to sort it out it would be the No 1 attraction. Right now you'll only get annoyed."

            "review": "exhilarating ottoman kitsch. Designed for Sultan Abdul Mecit in 1856, Dolmabahce Palace is among the most extraordinary residences of Europe. Although the Ottoman Empire was already in decline at the time of its construction, no expense was spared, thanks in part to loans from Continental bankers that ultimately bankrupted the Ottoman treasury. The architect for the palace had cut his teeth designing sets for operettas in Paris: The result is a camp pastiche of a European palace. You can visit the palace only by taking one of two guided tours. One covers the men's section, staterooms and the vast ceremonial hall, and the other visits the harem section, including the living quarters of the Sultan. If you can take only one tour, visit the fabulous ceremonial hall\u2014designed to hold 2,500 people\u2014and note the superb decoration of the dome and the English chandelier. Also check out the main bathroom, or hamam, the walls of which are fitted with splendid Egyptian alabaster and solid silver taps. Attentive visitors will notice that all the clocks in the palace read 9:05 am at all times. This is because Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, died in his bedroom in the palace at 9:05 am on 10 November 1938. On Tuesdays during the summer, the Turkish army band, dressed in the costumes of the famous Janissaries, performs traditional music outside the Imperial Gate."

It is located some distance from the main historical areas, but it is right at the end stop of the tram that runs along the Bosporus, so very easy to get to. And it you are staying near the Taksim Square area, it is straight downhill (a VERY STEEP downhill!)The palace was the residence of the Sultan and his family from the mid-1800's, as well as the residence for Ataturk after the Ottomans fell. It is very European in style...largely baroque-ish. But grand in every respect. The phenomenal chandeliers and ornate decorations give a clear feel for the era. Do spring for the Full Ticket, which include the Harem (private family quarters in the back of the main palace. Just interesting to see how the family lived...not so good to be wife number 3 or 3, but Mother of the Sultan, was clearly a pretty good deal...if you didn't mind ever leaving the Palace!"

However you don't really need all the knowledge to enjoy the spectacular wealth put into this. The busier it is, the more rushed the tours are. Also you have the clock museum, kristal pavilion and paint museum which are all worth your time. In total I spent 3.5h by myself at this place and thought it was well worth the 40 TL entrance fee. This palace definitely left a permanent impression on me. I'm not sure it's a hate or love thing if you see the amounts of money the sultan's put into it, but it makes a great museum."

We were quite lucky to have visited on a sunny day despite it being a cold January; I would imagine there would be a considerable risk of flooding since the Bosphorus is literally on its doorstep.The main palace is a definite must-see; the opulence and riches of the Ottoman sultans is embedded in all 260+ rooms of the palace, with lavish chandeliers and towering ceilings. The grand ceremonial hall in particular is absolutely awe-inspiring. It is a pity that photos are not allowed and you can only explore with guided tour, but perhaps it is an ideal opportunity to take in everything with full attention rather than behind a camera lens.

You'd enter a huge room and he'd say \"here's this painting, here's this furniture, over there you can see this piano, ok next room.\" And off he went. There was far too little time to look at any of the objects in any detail and, because you're part of a tour, there's a chaperone at the back to make sure you're not falling behind. The palace itself is beautifully preserved, wonderfully extravagant and, with an Isic card, only TL 5 to enter! But I would be hacked off if I had paid 40 lira for what was provided."

The interior is mindblowing the least. All the gold and ivory you can imagine is the decor of this palace! One great thing is that all visits are guided (included in the ticket) actually you cannot visit the palace on your own. The guide gives information about the various venues of the palace and this helps the audience to better feel the atmosphere of the Sultans that once lived there. We also got tickets for the Harem which was also a guided visit. I must say that although it was not a bad experience you will not miss anything if you do not include the Harem to your visit, at some point it felt like a repetition! There are also a couple of of side museums to the palace located in its walls, there is a clocks museum and a paintings museum - we did not visit them though!I suggest you put Dolmabahce in your must see list if you visit Istanbul!"

Topkapi had become old and worn and was out of fashion for the times. All the Iznik tile was just so Medieval and Early Modern. And well, we just couldn't have that.Nothing says you're a Sultan in the mid 19th century quite like 45,000 square feet, 285 rooms, 46 halls, 6 hamams, 68 toilets, and the world's largest Bohemian Crystal Chandelier (a gift from Queen Victoria, who was a relative) weighing in at a mere 4.5 tonnes. And that's not going into details about the Baccarat crystal lamps, or the other chandeliers (yes, numbers 4, 3, and 2 are also there) or the Hereke carpets, the alabaster, porphyry marbles, the Marmara. Let's just say, it's FANCY.You go through here with a guide. Tours are given in Turkish and English and possibly Arabic but I couldn't work that out despite the number of people asking for tours in Arabic whether that actually was an option. There are no pictures. You will take away all that is gaudy and extravagant in your head. If you hate this kind of bizarre Rocco, Baroque, Neoclassical love child you will not enjoy this. But if like me, you find this kind of absurd moment in a monarchy when clearly it is all falling apart, but that just at that moment, then is when they decide to build the piece de resistance, that monument to their utter downfall, then you will love this. And of course, Ataturk's room is in there as well, where he died and that is actually quite moving because he must have been an amazing man, really, to bring Turkey out of the Ottoman period and into the Republic. So go for that if you must."

The tour guides herd you through quickly (they have to, because it's huge!) and many rooms are cordoned off. The whole thing is incredibly over-the-top. Some people in my family found it amazing. I found it to be too much. Highlights include the show-stopping Ceremonial Room at the end of the tour, which made all our jaws drop.On a clear day that really allows you to enjoy the waterfront location, I might have enjoyed this attraction more.

You have to wear plastic show covers, and photos inside are not allowed. The tour guide was very informative, but for the number of people on the tour, he maybe could have been a little louder to be heard in the back of the group. Overall the tour was a great experience.We did not have time to go see the haram or other parts other than the main palace, but if I'm ever back in Istanbul, that will be first on my list of things to do."

The places, the food, the souvenirs - everything dates back to the glory days of the Sultans. And nothing depicts it better than the Dolmabahce Palace. Just off the Bophorus strait, the building is the epitome of extravagance and great design (admittedly most times, useless). Boasting the biggest chandelier of its time, it surely is worth getting in line of a guided tour for. No photography allowed inside which is a shame. Overall, worth the visit."

It is one of the better attractions in Istanbul and well worth then two hours it will take to see both the main palace and the Harem. The glittering crystal is everywhere to be seen in the main palace, including on the beautiful staircase. In contrast the Harem is less lavish but by no means less interesting. You can buy a single ticket and just see the main Palace or a ticket which allows both visits. All tour are guided and in a number of languages including English. If you want to hear what is said try and stand near to the guide and listen very carefully as they talk very quickly. It does not seem to be the practice to tip the guides."

The location is great, the garden is very nice, and the decorations inside really impressed me. So much gold, painted ceilings and signs of wealth! The guided tours are not the best. I have been here twice and one time I had a great guide who was telling a lot about the history and the difference rooms. Another time there was a guide who was trying to finish the tour as quick as possible. I guess you have to be a bit lucky with that. The harem section is also worth a visit (10 Turkish Lira more expensive), although it feels less luxurious. In this area Ataturk lived and passed away."

As soon as you enter the grounds, you are greeted by gardens that have been kept immaculately clean and wonderful. We arrived past 3PM and so we could only visit the Palace and not the Harem (separate admission). The tour of the palace is guided and we were lucky that we got there five minutes before the start of the tour. You are required to cover your shoes with blue plastic covers to protect the floor. The guide said the tour would run an hour but it was closer to 45 minutes (I checked the time). The guide was very informative and again, like most architectural attractions in Istanbul, everything was jaw-dropping amazing. There is a lot to see in the palace that the guide would point out. This tour is comparable to Versailles and Schonbrunn Palaces but what made it unique was its location beside the Bosphorus. Visiting it at dusk lent a more mysterious feel of the place. Tip: If you wish to visit both the palace and the harem, be sure you're there before 2PM."

The inside of the Palace is quite protected by a number of guards/guides, there is STRICT order of NO PHOTOS inside and they are watching your every step. I did not dare to take my phone out and take even one sneaky picture! I like and enjoy tours of castles as much as anybody else, I come from a historic country so I am used to certain historic interiors so there were 2 points of truly unbelievable WOW: 1) The Ambassadorial Hall at the beginning of the tour where foreign dignitaries and diplomats were received by the Sultans. This 'room' is unreal! Gold on ceilings, magnificent entry staircase with Baccarat balustrade - yes, crystal pieces of staircase(!), and the huge massive hanging crystal chandeliers and huge massive standing candleholders are sight for sore eyes! I cannot imagine Vikings or English diplomats arriving here and not being in immense awe of the 14 tons of gold used in this palace almost everywhere and on anything, not being blown away by the 283 rooms, or by the 80 meters long corridor (hallway) connecting the male quarters (aka the Palace) with the women quarters (aka the Harem). It is something! ...And the second WOW is:2) The Ceremonial Hall in the basement with its sheer size, out-of-this-world beautiful blue dome/ceiling and massive tall columns that are actually not there for structural support but are hollow(!!) and were used as central heating system with heated air from a near-by kitchen is something that you just cannot even comprehend."

Yes, we went to all, literally all attraction that everyone suggested but Dolmabahce palace is definately our favourite. Its not cheap, 40 lira for entrance including Harem section but trust me its worth it. And the bed where Atartuk rest in peace located in Harem section. U cant simply go inside and wander yourself like in Topkapi palace. You'll be following scheduled guided tour either in english or turkish language. Its beyond words to describe how beautiful and majestic the interior of the palace. No picture or video allow in the palace and yes dont touch anything and you only allowed to walk on the red carpet. It seem too much restriction but once youre there you'll understand you in old palace where everything still in original place. The tour guide will stop at certain section and explained the history of the palace. Giving chances if i ever comeback to Istanbul i'll definately visit this palace again compare to all other attraction."

The guide responsible for the english tour spoke so bad english with such a terrible accent, so no one could understand what she was saying. Apart from her, our group was accompanied by another person who made sure that no one could observe any item more than 2 seconds, being extremely rude with us, crying costantly with bad manner: \"\u039cove, move, move\" as if we were sheeps escaping the flock.

It seems like every room was simply done over-the-top with antiques, ornate furniture, textiles, chandeliers, you name it. It is all rich, gorgeous and excessive.The entrance fee is 40 TL for a combined ticket to the main Palace and the Harem. The visit is only done with a guided tour. The tour provides some basic information on the most important rooms. Moving from one room to the next simply felt rushed, with little additional history or information and there was just too much to see with no time to pause and admire. We tried to explore a little more on our own which basically meant we were always behind and often were rushed by other staff to move along quickly.Once you left the Harem you were on your own to explore other parts of the gardens and grounds.The Crystal Pavilion was an additional little jewel."

Our tour guide was very intelligent and answered any questions, one question I was scared to ask was \"where is the sultanas tv kept?\" it must be a decent size, at least 32 inch but it would need some surround sound...the acoustics weren't great in the great hall, ironic.

Then, he took off like on a race to complete the tour path. Photographs are not allowed in order to sell more books, or to for whatever reason. There were few signs to explain rooms, or anything else. Wall posters to explain in the painting section were written in a very awkward English. Overall, the place is quite lovely, but the presentation gets an F. Study in advance so that you will be able to recognize the highpoints as the guides don't seem to care. Oh, an areas that were open to the public in years past are now closed. It was a disappointing visit. There is also a cafe on site with a very limited selection of treats, and the one in the painting museum was a few bottles of pop and a young guy who made a very small to tiny cup of turkish coffee for a high prices.

Having a Museum Pass really helped as one doesn't have to wait in line to buy a ticket. My visit was on a Friday, which coincided with the visit of a local school. It was a crazy sight, to see so many children being herded in groups. I was happy to have had the sense to buy the museum pass. You are herded in groups of English speaking and non-English speaking groups and photography is strictly forbidden. It takes away the pleasure somewhat, as you are hustled along by your guide. But it still is the most stunning place I have seen in all my travels, rooms awash in luxurious furniture, and the view of the sea lapping peacefully alongside....How lucky must have been those people who lived there to live in such a gorgeous palace, right next to the sea was my constant thought. The Harem was the gem of the palace in my opinion, the queen mother's chambers, the little rooms for the ladies in waiting etc. The crystal banisters and the huge chandeliers of the reception hall were an equally enchanting sight."

We left the main palace until last and encountered a big queue, so go here when you first arrive. The palace is quite amazing, although the guides don't give much information. The art gallery is well worth having a look around and the grounds are beautiful, with gates out onto the Bosphorus, but it was too rough to venture right to the shoreline the day we were there. Check out the impressive huge gates on the roadside too. The clock museum and crystal room was closed due to the low season, but the palace, art gallery and grounds more than justified the visit here.

However, one is required to enter through a tour either in english or turkish unless one pays extra for an outside tour group, which many do. My preference however us to visit places on my schedule and pace rather than that of someone else. Getting there via most tour groups is to simply sit in the bus or van. On your own the choices are taxi and public transportation. To get there via public transportation is not difficult: take the t1 tram line to the last stop in Asia istanbul and then walk down the street (in the same direction as the tram was going) and you will be there in a few minutes. Once there you will need to buy either a main house ticket, a harem ticket, or both. Warning: the harem is Not out of Scheherazade, but rather a series of rooms as in any residence. The main house is clearly more impressive but there are some interesting rooms in the harem. If you buy both together you get a 10 tl discount. You should probably get both. After you get in line they run a tour every 30 minutes or so. You have to put plastic wraps on your shoes and wait for the tour. In the english tour you may get many people who speak any language except turkish: english, Spanish, french, arabic, and German were in our group. Our guide was late so we started late. Sometimes guides are inspired people who revel in the property they present, but our guides had memorized speeches in English who were clearly happy to get through each spiel. The only time i saw them animated was when they talked to other guides in their native turkish. I am sure they were good people but this was just a job. We were hurried past many rooms, with longer stops at the big three rooms. The palace was very impressive more in a european than turkish style (as intended when it was missed) but the need to hurry through did not allow one to see or appreciate the details and fully take in the grandeur. No questions were allowed until the end, apparently so we did not interrupt the planned speech lest the whole thing be lost. By the end i just wanted out and couldn't remember the questions. Leaving this part of the tour one then walked halfway around this very large building to the harem where we waited for another twenty minutes for that tour as the tours were not coordinated. That one was shorter and less impressive but still interesting. However, the tour remained stale and flat and the information they gave is already in any competent travel book. Also no pictures were allowed. I understand no flash but not no pictures. We are charged to enter but cannot keep any reminders or remembrances. I do not know if this is to make money from the gift shop or just to keep the tour moving quickly. Topkapi palace is much more tourist friendly in all these regards. Overall i am glad i saw it and 40tl is not an excessive charge. But the whole thing could be better presented: more enthusiasm if nothing else. If i wasn't so cheap and on my own schedule i would consider visiting this with a personal tour guide but not with another large mixed group which simply cost more money. If you are in the city for more than a day, though, try to see this site."

The Palace and grounds itself is very splendour, the views of the Bosporous River and the grand decor within the Palace. The only way to tour the Palace is by guide only available in Turkish and English. Also keep in mind there is no photography anywhere but outside the Palace. Everyone queues up outside the Palace until you escorted inside. The guided tour was a bit dated and the Palace was in need of historical refurnishing and a good cleaning to preserve the Palace. The guided tour provided minimal history and our guide was similar in personality to that of a robot. The Palace is only about 159 years old, and showcased the Sultan's and the first President. The Palace furnishings and decor was absolutely amazing however it was very difficult to see everything through all the dust sitting on the surfaces. The chandlers were our favourite part. The Harem was also guided and in Turkish or English with another queue to wait in. The Harem guided tour was a joke with zero history and would not acknowledge the true history of the Harem. If you are wishing to visit the concubine dormitory you are out of luck, the only part of the Harem tour you are allowed to see is the upstairs royalty tour. The entire admission price per person with the Harem is 40tl: Palace Tour 45 minutes, Harem 30 minutes. If you want a guided history lesson this isn't your place. If you compare this to Versailles you definitely slept through that tour. Good luck in whatever you choose."

Downside is you cannot take any photos inside and they do have security inside patrolling the crowd to ensure this. However, the opulence of the palace will leave you with a wonderful memory of a place from time gone bye, truly beautiful. Some of the best photo shots are from outside the Palace, just walk around the grounds, the Bosporus is a great backdrop for some of your photos. They have a nice little coffee/dessert caf\u00e9 close to the Harem which is great for a break, non smoking indoors. During the summer months when the gardens are in full bloom it must be even more spectacular."

Also, you had to enter with a tour and follow the guide around, so that you could not explore at your own pace. The information that the guide provided was interesting, but the tour was large so it was hard to hear him sometimes. Also, I couldn't get a great look at things before we had to move on.

Apart from the pure grandeur evident in the furnishings and chandeliers, the tour gives you some insight into the workings and culture of the Sultan's government during the later Ottoman period. Also, take the Harem Tour which shows the apartments and living quarters for the women living there, ie the Sultans wives and mother. Also, saw the room in which Ataturk died.The tour is always organized and guided by someone already there for you, so you can just take the tram and then walk a short distance along the Bosphorous to the palace. The tour of the main palace was very good but the Harem tour guide's English was not so good and his descriptions were fairly brief. I came away wanting to know more about the Harem culture but will have to pursue that on my own, I guess. Overall, well worth seeing---beautiful palace and grounds."

You can not take pictures inside as they tell you, but if you are sneaky enough and find something worth photographing you can take a picture or two. I thought they don't allow to take pictures so you don't destroy reputation of this palace as something special when it's not. Halls are coverd in dust, dirt and bad design. Lavish, oh yes, bit without taste and passion. Mostly without passion of those who take care of the palace now. Harem is almost the same as main palace. Maybe a bit better.

We got both tickets and needed to join a tour in order to go inside. On this particular day, there were at least 50 of us on the tour. The guide spent a significant amount of time yelling at people \"no photos\" and I'm pretty sure security followed up with those breaking the rules ensuring they deleted the photos. What irritated me the most was the hypocritical guard, Mr. Koruma, allowing certain individuals to take photos when he thought no one was looking. They just happened to be young, pretty girls. When I caught him taking photos of the girls in the harem, I couldn't resist the urge to yell \"no photos!\" Lol"

Having a private guide gave me prime and immediate access to the interior. The staff does a wonderful job of staggering tour groups into the Palace; no overcrowding is allowed. As I walked through with my guide, many times we appeared to have the place to ourselves. All the rooms and furnishings show their age but are in great condition. Even though much of the inside is closed off from the public, what can be seen is amazingly authentic and beautiful and resembling the modern European style of the period. From the outside, one can see how grand the Palace is and appreciate its location on the Bosphorus Strait."

Although it's relatively alot, and you can go to one section and not the two. I really advise buying the combined ticket and going to both. The first section was where the issues of the country were dealt with and the second section is the Harem which is the house of the Sultan. The palace is special with all its decorations that are made of gold and real english crystals. The palace was designed by french designers (one that desgined the paris opera) and other english and italian designers. The tour inside is only done through a guided tour, and we had to wear plastic bags on our shoes (provided at the gate). The guided tour turned out to be at a great advantage, the guide had great english and explained very well everything important in the palace.

Here you can see the sultan's perverse luxury and it will take your breath away again and again. Expect slow lines as they have to guided tours every 20-30 min (Turkish or English). Our first guide had a strong and firm voice and polite attitude. The guide in the Harem part of the palace was the complete opposite."

The second part, in the harem, was hugely rushed with a very disengaged tour guide. He told us that there wasn't space to stop and we were practically running! Would recommend going at the back of the group so you have more time to look at things, since the tour guide doesn't have anything of value to say!"

It is interesting to learn about the rich lifestyles of sultans and their families, The opulence was shocking to me but I think it is worth a visit. Going with a tour group is mandatory so it requires a bit of patience. Queue for tickets alone took more than 30 min. Then again you queue for English or Turkish Tours. I think the tour had just the right amount of infomation but groups should be smaller. Room after room, you will see so much history and luxury. Glad to see that the Palace is well maintained but makes me wonder how many people need to be employed just for housekeeping.. Those massive chandeliers!!!! I don't want to be the cleaning lady here. Highly recommend this attraction."

A new sultan's palace with a European twist built in the 19th century displaying incredible wealth of the Ottoman Empire. The excursion is split into two parts with separat access and separate guides plus a long wait if you miss your every 30-min entrance. Only allows tourists in groups and a No Photo policy which is a shame as the official guide book to the palace contains poor photos. The groups are enormous and not everyone can hear the guide's explanations. I think the museum should invest in more guides and make the explanations more interesting. They did not say anything one cannot read in the average guide book which is a shame. The museum forces tourists to wear plastic overshoes which is not understandably why as nobody us allowed to step aside from the main carpeted tourist trail anyway. The palace is closed on Mondays and Thursdays."

The crystal chandeliers in many rooms in the main palace are nothing short of amazing - British crystal by the way.The Harem is quite bare compared to the main palace and the guide who will take you round is very well informed.This tour is excellent value at \u00a310 per person, you won't be sorry that you took this trip."

We took the tram from Sultanahmet to Karakoy and it is just a straight walk to the Palace. There is a guide for both the main palace and the Harem but like a previous reviewer mentioned, you do not get time to savour the glory of the Palace. I guess they have to do this otherwise it would get overcrowded and too congested. I still think it is worth a visit. Should be one of the top things to do when visiting Istanbul (in my humble opionion ;o)"

Each tour is approximately 40 minutes long.No photos are allowed at all - which is a huge pity. The palace is absolutely beautiful. And you have to enter with a guide. We were lucky to have a great guide whose voice projected so it was easy to hear him, however, the tour was very rushed. You weren't given any opportunity to marvel at the rooms. And the groups are very big.The harem tour was a bit disappointing because we couldn't understand the tour guide - his English dialect wasn't great; and after seeing the grand rooms in the standard tour - the harem tour was a bit of a let down. So if you are rushed for time then give this one a miss."

It is easy to see why they moved. This gem of a building contains all mod cons. At first gaslit, later electric, centrally heated, with cascades of presence rooms and waiting rooms for ambassadors and roaly visitors, it extends for seemingly miles of corridors. Many oil paintings of battle scenes and associated military personnel litter the walls. The huge chandelier in the ballroom was the gift of Queen Victoria. Everywhere are crystal-encrusted flambeaux, and one staircase has crystal balusters. The furnishings are plush and rich in colour. If the palace lacks reserve, it makes up for this in an opulence scarcely matched anywhere else."

Built during the rise of the Victorian period and the decline of Ottoman rule, this palace is unlike other Ottoman stately homes and borrows a lot from Victorian culture, so that wallpaper (and other Victorian trappings) was preferred over the rich ornate indigenous ceramic and tile heritage. A sad statement on the change of taste at the time. But very interesting to visit and to learn the history of this palace and its place in late Ottoman history. In a scale of top 10 things to do in Istanbul, this would be a 5. It can be done in an afternoon but may take all day. Compared to all the other visit-worthy places in Istanbul, this one isn't as essential as some of the others."

The Dolmabahce Palace was built on the orders of Sultan Abdul Mecit in the mid 19th century (1856) along the Bosphorus waterfront in the area we know today as Besiktas.The palace was designed by Armenian architects.The design of the palace was a complete change of style from the earlier Topkapi Palace where they had smaller buildings in various courtyards. Here, more in European style the palace was one large imposing building. More than 30 tonnes of gold was used to decorate the interior of the palace which has almost 300 rooms. Of these the Ceremonial hall is a huge room which is said to be able to hold 2500 people. The chandelier in this room is one of the largest in the world.You usually enter the palace through the Imperial gate. In front of the palace, just after the gate is the Swan fountain. There are two other gates, the Treasury gate which is very pretty, and the Bosphorus gate through which the Sultans boarded their boats along the Bosphorus.In the palace is a set of rooms used by Mustafa Kemal 'Ataturk' where he spent his last years. Many clocks here have been stopped at 09:05, the time at which Ataturk passed away.In the garden is a cafe where visitors can sit outdoors and enjoy a snack by the Bosphorus, however it gets crowded and by the time we got ant service there was only enough time to have a lemonade and leave.There is also a beautiful 4 story clock tower in the garden (reviewed seperately) and the Dolmabahce Mosque just outside the gate which is also worth a visit.Photography, though permitted in the garden and outside the palace, is NOT allowed inside which is a pity."

Standing at the entrance steps, waiting for our guided tour, one can't help imagine how grand this must have been when it was an actual residence. Tour guides are very seasoned and their narration reflects pride of Turkish heritage. There are many sections of this palace (art museum etc. each with a separate ticket), but the main tour and the harem are a must see. There are benches facing the Bosphorus where you can relax and watch Eastern Istanbul.Photography is not allowed inside the palace, but you will see many tourists abusing this request. Tour guides and security constantly remind and reprimand people - \"Lady I can see your flash\" - and yet people keep their cellphone cameras running. There is a museum store that sells picture postcards of the Palace interior.This palace is definitely worth a second visit - don't skip this."

If you want to see the palace you should wait for 100 people buy the ticket, strange that there is no machines with it like in other Turkish museums. So we waited for 1 hour on the sun in +30. When we reached the ticket offfice, they said that visa and mastercard is not accepted. We asked if they accept Euro they said yes. 60 TL were counted as 18 Euro, which was okay acording to change office price 3,4TL for 1 Euro. I gave 20 Euro and got back 2 TL ( insted of 2 Euro or 6,8 TL). So I said in ticket office that it must be mistake and the price is 3,4 TL for Euro, The ticket-seller gave me more 1 TL. I said that it is wrong again. So he took my ticket back and threw in my 20 Euro with words :\" you not gonna enter museum today\". This small man who works on governmet not only cheated me, he also humiliated me. I said I would not move from the place I stand untel I get my ticket (there were 100 people behind me standing on hot sun). So after 5 minutes he gave me my ticket and 3 TL (cheated me again). We went to polis and told them everything, I hope they did somethiing and that man lost his job, but I am not sure about it, because can you imagine how many people he cheated? He is a thief who works on government, this is really big shame for Turkish Government, not any country allow such cheating in legal ticket office. The most terrible serive ever.

I had thought about taking a tour to get there, but then decided to do it on my own and found it was very easy. I was staying near the Blue Mosque so just jumped on a tram heading in the direction of the Galata Bridge and stayed on the tram until the end of the line. Got off at the last stop and walked just a few minutes further down the main road to the Palace. The grounds of the Palace are beautiful, with statues, lovely lawns and flowerbeds, fountains and ornate gates opening out onto the Bosphorus River. To go inside the Palace you must join a tour (they leave every 15 minutes to half hour and are run in a number of different languages). While the tour is rather rudimentary and feels a little rushed, the Palace is jaw-droppingly splendid & for me the Ceremonial Hall was the jewel in the crown.I only spent about 2 hours there as my time was limited - did the main tour, the Harem and walked around the gardens. If you wanted to do the clock museum and the art museum you would need a bit longer. There is a caf\u00e9 within the Palace gardens so you could easily spend half a day at the site. I went early in the morning (as was recommended to me) to avoid the crowds of the afternoon. NB: the site is not included in the Istanbul Museum Pass. The ticket for the Sel\u00e2ml\u0131k (the main part of the Palace - the section with the most gold and crystal!) is TL30, the ticket for the Harem is TL20; however if you get a joint ticket for the Harem and the Sel\u00e2ml\u0131k it is TL40.

Once inside it was hot, oppressive and there wasn't an opportunity to take in the exhibits. Of particular interest to us was the crystal staircase - spectacular and the ceremonial hall.

The actual palace was built in the 19th century and is decorated in a rather eclectic style that uses elements completely foreign to the Ottoman culture (likely in a deliberate attempt to break with tradition and look modern).The palace manages indeed to impress but at the same time disappoints as it seems out of place in the history of the Ottoman empire (perhaps in itself a sign of the deepening crisis in the empire at the time).The way the visits are organized is not great (it actually reminded me of the museum visits I had in primary school... :)) - a guide takes close to 100 people and whizzes them through some of the most relevant rooms stopping every now and then to deliver a pre-approved and well-rehearsed speech that very few people can actually hear. The groups are too large and there is a lot of noise from other groups and also from individuals that simply give up trying to follow the guide (very difficult indeed under the circumstances, so they're not to blame). You are not allowed to visit at your own pace nor to take photos (not that all people listen and then you have embarrasing situations when security people start raising their voices in a more or less successful attempt to become convincing etc.)We visited on a Sunday (early afternoon) when everything else (Harem, Clock museum, Cafe) appeared closed - we weren't told at the entrance and were let to discover that on our own so that was again dissapointing. To sum things up, Dolmabahce palace is impressive but I would recommend a visit only after seeing the other main attractions in Istanbul (and perhaps reading a bit about the last Turkish sultans and Attaturk)."

Fascinating architecture and splendour with the gold gilded roofs, chandeliers as well as other high quality works, one can easily understand there was no cutting back in terms of expenseFor Turkish locals, this place is extremely significant as it was the here were Ataturk spent his last days and eventually passed away. Things to note:- location is 5 mins walk from kabatas tram station- tour lasts approx 1 hour- it's a guided tour although it's hard to follow what the guides are saying- they have a limit (not sure how many) to the number of visitors in a day. After this, they reserve the right to close the ticket hall even before the day has ended- no photography is allowed which is a shame- you can take your pram in although it isn't pram friendly. At a certain point you will need to lift them up a flight of stairs to go the top floor and similarly back down"

It was built in the 19th century by Sultan Abdulmecid, and was an attempt to outstrip the best that Europe had to offer. To say that the result is excessively sumptious is to undersell it! The resources needed to build this place helped to bankrupt the Ottoman empire finally. Apparently Abdulmecid's successor hated the place so much he built a new palace! After the empire fell, the palace was occupied by the great Kemal Attaturk until his death. I am not sure why a man of his character and background would want to live here! But he did.It's not possible to wander round on your own, only as part of an organised tour, of which there were a great many. Not ideal, too much congestion and hold-ups, and at times it was hard to hear what the guide was saying. Also, photography is forbidden, this is a shame as there is so much to photograph! Also, the gardens are delightful. A highly recommended visit."

The palace is really big and beautiful it is very well decorated. The bad news is that you can't take pictures inside.

Not to be missed!Ignore any negative reviews, have a great visit by planning properly.The palace suffers queues - avoid them by ARRIVING EARLY (always good advice for istanbul attractions). Be there at 9 - certainly well before 10 - & you'll get straight in.No need to buy a half-day tour to go there, just take the T1 tram to Kabatas & walk 5 minutes.There are 4 areas to see, 2 with obligatory free guided tours. Sure the tours could be longer (2 hours?!) but you can always pay and go round a second time IF you feel the need.Main palace tour (Selamlik) in English starts every 10 minutes, big group, lasts 40 minutes. Simply fabulous superb interiors, good explanations by the guide.Harem tour in English lasts 30 minutes. Ideally you would visit harem first as it is much less spectacular than the main palace, so it can be disappointing if seen after. And the \"guided tour\" is merely a walk through the building, glancing into rooms for a few seconds as you pass them, so pick whichever language queue is shorter!Much more impressive than those of the harem are the interiors of the paintings museum - formerly the Princes Palace. It also has a charming (& quiet) caf\u00e9 with cheap prices (5TL soft drink)And don't miss the dramatic Crystal Palace situated in the spectacular grounds."

The guide's English was a little unusual but once we worked out how he said certain words we could follow everything he said. If you have limited time put the other big sights first, but if you have the time it is interesting to visit!"

We had this included in a day-long tour of Istanbul, which is an efficient way to see the palace (as well as a cruise on the Bosphorus, and several other sites). We had minimal waiting time and no problem hearing our guide's commentary. At the beginning of the tour you will be required to don foot covers over your shoes to protect the floors, Also, be aware that no photos are allowed. The size and finish of the palace attests to the wealth and prestige of the sultanate, even as its power and influence were waning. Definitely worth visiting after seeing Topkapi, the original palace of the sultanate. The grounds are very nice, too, if you have time to linger."

Bit of a shame, as I would have liked to spend more time in the palace. It was 35 degrees outside when I visited, so extremely hot inside also. Its worth to see both the palace and the harem, where you get a true sense of the family's life. Well worth a visit."

Amazing amounts of gold leaf and crystal! The tour guides have huge groups, are hard to hear, and don't really tell you much history or archetectual information. Because of the large group, it moves slowly. But the family/harem wing is very even slower and we had even less information from that English speaking guide. The family wing is mostly quite plain. Be aware that no pictures are allowed. Getting to the palace on the Big Red Bus tour was a bad choice because of traffic delays. Took hours and hours to and from. Take the Istanbul ferry instead. Then th tour was so slow that the entire process took 5 to 6 hours. If you are only in Istanbul for a couple of days skip the Dolmabahce and stick with the Older Topkapi palace in the central location near Hagia Sophia."

Both tours were very informative and provided historical insight. The English skills of the guides were also very good. You are free to wander the grounds. You can visit the art gallery, have a cup of tea or lunch or just sit and watch the ships go by on the Bosphorus. Surprisingly we found that we enjoyed the Palace for almost four hours. I suspect that some days can be crowded but the whole grounds are quite spacious.To return to the city centre you can get a tram, bus or taxi. I would suggest a return walk along the water.

The nicest things about the palace are the view over Bosphorus and the painting museum section outside the palace.

I must say of all the places I've been to in Istanbul, replete with history and artifacts that they are, Dolambache was a disappointment. Compared to European museums it's not very well kept and you can damage from dust and elements all around. I think the palace aptly depicts Turkish rulers' desires to leave their past behind and embrace western sensibilities which they considered new/modern. The outcome, at least to the extent of what remains of this palace, is a bit of confusion that one finds hard to enjoy in or relax. Nonetheless one can argue that it's part of Turkish historic trajectory which somehow doesn't appear to have settled just yet. The palace grounds on the other hand are beautiful with sea views that are wonderful."

To get there you take tram T1 until Kabatas and then you have to walk for 10-15 minutes. When we got there at around 9.30 AM the queue wasn't long and we waited no more than 10 minutes to buy our tickets. This was finally a well organized place, there are guided tours both in the palace and in the harem and therefore the number of people entering is limited. The harem section is beautiful, but I believe the Topkapi harem is more beautiful and if you only want to see one harem you should see the one in Topkapi. Lovely view over the Bosphorus strait."

Also, the people at the ticket entrance were rude and unpleasant, perhaps because of the huge crowds and lines, so it was a bit of a weird start to a beautiful visit.It is worth seeing the 4.5 ton chandelier in the main hall.

The halls and rooms, except for the formal ball room you visit at the end of the tour that is really impressive in size, are very ordinary XIXth century halls. You are forced to wait under the sun and then to follow an enormous group of people inside with a guide. There is no air conditioning inside and the visit lasts 45 minutes.The visit to the harem really doesn't add to the picture, the highlight of it the room where Ataturk passed away. The guided tour (compulsory) takes 30 minutes, and no, there's no air conditioning.So it's really better from the outside, where you can take photos with a wide lens of the facade and the Bosphorus. If you want to go inside be prepared to queue up and to a boring and uncomfortable visit. And just don't visit the harem, it doesn't add much to the experience."

In both parts there are guides who forms groups in English and Turkish. The entrance to the Harem and Selamlik it's not possible without guide (Of course, it's included in price). Garden is the most beautiful there. You will enjoy. It's allowed to make photos outside, but no inside (you can make some photos, lot of people don't respect this).Palace is closed on Mondays and Thursdays. Be sure to go there before 9 am, later is a big crowd. My advice to all visitors: visit Dolmabahce (and Topkapi, Hagia Sophia, Galata tower...) on your own and without the agency because it is cheaper and the best is when you can manage your time on the way you want.

Set apart from the Old City in Istanbul, the Dolmabahce Palace complex is but a short tram-ride away from the city centre.We arrived early to avoid queueing in the sun, which is to be recommended, especially as this is not part of the Museum Pass so no skipping the queue.The main palace is spectacular inside, although the lack of breeze can make it slightly stuffy. In addition, wandering solo through the palace is forbidden, so you may have to wait for the tour to begin. Try and stay near the front or hearing the guide can be tricky. Also it is a requirement in all the indoor areas to wear overshoes, so get used to them.The harem had a similar vibe to the larger palace tour, and it included rooms from the life of Ataturk. Our personal favourite was either the black/gold themed sitting room belonging to the Sultan's mother, or the blue and gold, French style motifs in one of the larger rooms.If you're buying the complete ticket, be sure to visit the Painting Museum, as it has an enjoyable collection of art from both Turkish and European painters (although the still life drawings are somewhat inferior to everything else).If you're feeling adventurous, head further up the coast to Ortakoy mosque for some filled jacket potatoes in the streets nearby."

The Persians coined the term 'paradise' to describe a walled garden in their brown and dusty land; well, Turkey has its own paradise with this palace, open to public view. It wasn't so much the spectacular ceilings and mirrors and chandeliers and furniture that got me; it was the beautifully-laid out gardens with a wide selection of trees, the location right on the banks of the Bosphorus, and... the amazing inlaid floors! Take careful note of the parquet floors inlaid with ornate patterns in dark wood; gorgeous. I would have loved to take photos: but that was not permitted indoors, and the guidebooks and postcards on offer at the end really didn't share my idiosyncratic enthusiasm, so I'll have to trust to my increasingly unreliable memory to verify these delights. Well worth a visit but (a) take a water bottle and (b) there's a lovely cafe at the end with cheap and highly- appreciated lemonade..."

But luckily a guide approached us to take us in a private tour and to skip the lines. He took 75 TL per person including the tickets which we were told later that it's more expensive than the normal price but we didn't bother to be honest! The private tour wont take you everywhere so make sure you go around the palace even if it's over"

The gardens are very beautiful! If you want to enter the palaces, you have to put on those blue plastic bags around your feet to prevent you from damaging/ dirtying the place. Personally, I can get why they want guides to accompany you through the whole palace, but it's sometimes not done in an efficient way. Our guide had a very thick accent which made it sometimes very difficult to understand what he was saying. Of course this can still be ok if the number of the group of tourists wasn't so high. They assigned one guide to a group of 70-80 people. It would have been a more enjoyable experience if they could have lowered the number of people per guide. Most of the times the people tailing right behind the guide could hear what he was saying. You also cannot take pictures in the buildings.But apart from that, all the buildings are amazingly beautiful. The throne room was just stunning!! I would recommend people to see this place, but do not expect guides to add any value to your visit."

I went there walking from Istiklal street, I enjoyed early walk on the Bosphorus till the Palace. You must go early as possible, entrance only in guided groups so you wait until a tour ends to start your guided-tour, so try to be in the first one. - Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace (Saray\u0131) (Filled-in Garden) is the largest palace in Turkey (285 rooms, 46 halls) on a bay on the Bosphorus. It was the main administrative center of the Ottoman Empire from 1856 to 1922, it was home to six Sultans until 1924 where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, used the palace as a presidential residence during the summers. - The palace layout and d\u00e9cor reflect the increasing influence of European styles and standards on Ottoman culture in contrary to Topkap\u0131 Palace. Rarely you will find Versus of Quraa'n or arts of Arabic writing or mosaic or Islamic d\u00e9corations. Even clothes had been changed from Arabic koftan to European styles in moda.- Atat\u00fcrk section has a separate ticket, he spent the last days of his life in the palace and died in his bed at 9:05 a.m. November 10, 1938, in the former Harem section of the palace. All the clocks in the palace were stopped and set to 9:05 after his death.- The Harem (women) section is a exact example of a fully Western Palace in contrary completely to Harem section in Topkap\u0131 Palace. - Photography is not allowed inside the Palace.- Beside the palace, there is an interesting Art Museum, enjoy it ......Best of Luck, do not miss"

However, this was not worth all the trouble.The line to enter the palace took at least 1h (1h in the sun of course). Once you are in the palace, we had to queue another 1h in the sun to enter the palace for a 45 minute tour (everything is visited as a tour, you cannot go on your own). The tours themselves are not that interesting, not a lot of information is given I felt. It's very superficial. Moreover, the groups are of course packed as much as possible so you end up walking as a huge mass trying to hear what the guide is saying. Not very relaxing.We also visited the Harem. Another 30-40 minutes of queue in the sun for a 20 min visit. Clearly on for this one, the information the guide gave was quite poor. Nothing giving value to a guided tour.Moreover, the museum closes at 4pm so you end up spending half your day queuing the rest fighting to hear what the guide says.And of course, photos are not allowed. But you can however buy the CD at the museum with the photos.... Great...To conclude, I would not put this palace as a priority on your list unless you are visiting Istanbul outside of the touristic season.... And even if that's the case, I felt the palace is quite expensive for what it has to offer (or at least what is offered to us, clearly the palace has potential to be much more interesting)."

However you will spend at least an hour in lines (unless you get there early) and if you arrive at 1:00 you will probably not be able to see structures like the Harem and the Clockwork Museum due to the very early closing time of the Palace being 4:00 (at most museums internationally it's 5:30). The price to get in for an adult is 40TL but students it's 5TL. Once you actually enter the palace it is magnificent but it is not Versailles or the Catherine Palace. In fact if you have been to the Breakers and seen the mansions in Newport Rhode Island built around the same time you won't be missing much. The tour guides rush you in and out and you have no time to explore or take in the beauty of the building. also you are not allowed to take pictures and several people on the tour were forced to delete their photographs by security in plainclothes. I found this strange considering the fact that the palace was built in 1857. This leads me to believe that the strict no photo policy is strictly for marketing. While I would recommend this to Early Modern Turkish History buffs, I would not advise this for people who visiting Istanbul for just a few days. spend the extra hours at Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia or the Blue Mosque. Or visit the Deniz Museum next door and see the Sultan's Pleasure Boats. If the hours were better, the prices were cheaper and there was a more relaxed photo policy along with self guided tours this attraction would easily be 5 out of 5."

The harem was more personal as it was the family home for the sultan and his wives, concubines, his mum and children. You also see where Ataturk, Turkey's national hero, lived and the bedroom where he passed away. - Other areas to see The clock museum, the painting museum and the Crystal section are 10 lira each if you don't have the full ticket. We enjoyed them. - Toursyou cannot access the main palace or harem on your own, there are guided tours in English and Turkish, alternating every 15 minutes.

While no where near as large, the gardens and the palace are both quite large and shows the excess in which the Ottoman Empire became accustomed to. You also get to see Ataturk's office and final resting place. The gates facing the river make for wonderful photos as well as the lion fighting the alligator (my favorite). You must take a tour, you cannot just roam freely through the palace. In addition they do NOT allow photos and are very strict about it to the point if they catch you they will ask to see your camera and force you to delete pictures from your camera and escort you out. Some of the highlights here are the amazing chandeliers, the crystal staircase and enormous rug."

The guided tour makes it easy to understand and you get through the whole palace in around 35-40 minutes depending on the size of your group and the guide ofcourse.The Harem is not really worth visiting unless you are interested in watching the death bed of Ataturk and some palacial bedrooms.Overall a must visit place even if you are on a short 2 day trip (as I was). Should ideally visit aftet visiting Topkapi Palace/Museum to see the upgrade in lifestyle."

We kept bumping into the group ahead of us which was slow. Very pretty ornate stairs and chandelirs and tiles. Worth seeing. We had to cut out early so quickly followed the path.. when we got to the end there was a BIG AMAZING room with a fabulous gigantic chandelier and extremely high domed ceilings. I was in AWE! That last room was worth it all. I would have liked to stay in that room for a while!! We did not go into the 'harem' b/c it was a separate tour I believe and they only let you see a part of it anyway. Harem is just the living quarters I believe."

From the 35 tons of gold leaf used throughout the palace, the world's largest chandelier, the paintings on the walls, furnishings, and the murals on the domed ceilings, it rivals any palaces throughout the world. The intense colour of the murals is awe inspiring and to realize that it was lived in just 90 years ago, complete with radiators for heating it, as well as its magnificent furnishings helps one to realize fully how the sultans lived here before Turkey came into existence in 1922.It is best to go with your own guide or you are gathered together with about 140 other people and taken through at their pace, etc. Note that there are no photos allowed inside but there are lots of opportunities to photograph the outside and great gardens."

It was certainly worth the wait however I would suggest getting on a tour as they can get you in faster & I believe the tour guide would be better at describing the structure etc. It was built during the Ottoman Empire consisting of 3 parts -men's section(administrative), grand hall and of course the harem ( where the members of the royal family lived). It has a crystal staircase and a crystal chandelier weighing 4.5 tons and having 700+ candles given to the Sultan by Queen Victoria. If nothing else this is worth seeing!!

It's architecture and design speak a lot about the cultural and political decline of the Empire and it's constant confusion about whether it's an eastern or more western power. The palace is very tacky in a late 1800s sort of way. The swan fountains in the garden are all too much. The location is fabulous. Just on the Bosphorus, with a wonderful view of the old city and Asia. Strolling there on a sunny day is quite something. One can even forgive the palace design and see why it has an appeal. I reccomned not focusing too much on the inside and enjoying the gardens more. 45 mins is sufficient time."

There is a lovely staircase and other rooms that are rather impressive. My favourite part was the end: the largest chandelier I've ever seen, housed in an equally impressive grand hall that dwarfs many European palaces.There is an additional tour you can take for the harem but I'd recommend you save money and skip it - after seeing the main palace, this was FAR more lackluster and it's better to leave on a high.This is a much better palace than the disappointing Topkapi palace (more like a fortress).

You will be herded from hallway to hallway featuring the various rooms which after a while is getting a bit boring. Draconian rule of absolutely no photography inside the palace which is a shame because the main hall is quite stunning with the huge crystal chandelier and 3D ceiling mural. We also visited the Hurem which was the private quarters of the royal family. Again, we had to follow the tour guide. Quite a challenge trying to hear her when the group is large. The bedrooms were surprisingly small, not what I had expected it to be.The furnishings were, not surprisingly, quite worn out by now. You also get the privilege of seeing the royal loos. The gardens were very nice and you can take as many photographs as you want. Overall the exterior of the palace was very nice, more refreshing than the interior. If you only have a few days in Istanbul, this is one attraction you can skip. Only a limited number of visitors is allowed daily so it is best to get there early. It is about 500m away from the last tram stop in Kabatas. Btw there are several flights of stairs to manouver, so if you are physically challenged, more reason for you to skip this place."

The way the attendants shouted at anyone who strayed slightly off the carpets was so aggressive.3. You are herded around in a large control group from one stopping point to another, the following group always just behind. All you get are fleeting glimpses of the 'treasures' you pass as there is no allowance made for slowing down never mind daring to stop. When you do stop with your guide he gives a brief, hurried explanation in broken English which you try to hear before the group behind appear with their inevitable talking. No, writing this review is bringing back the whole horrible experience. Such a pity.

I did this yesterday as part of an all day, and while I wanted to like it, I would have rather spent the hour outside on the grass looking at the sea.There was no air conditioning. Our tour guide had to repeat his presentation in Russian and English which caused the group behind us to crowd in. I can't remember much of what he told us except there were lots of ambassadors and Ataturk died there. The harem areas and the ballrooms were interesting, but might have been more so if I could remember their importance.No pictures are allowed inside.If you are a Turkish history or Turkish politics wonk, this place could be something for your to see list if you have a few days in Istanbul."

If you can get over the annoyances of the place (have to go on a tour with a guide with a large group, so that the second half of the group can't hear what the guide is saying anyway). The last site on the tour makes it worthwhile - the main ceremonial hall is huge, with a dome that is close in grandeur to the Hagia Sophia with a huge chandelier hanging down the bottom.I also visited the Harem here, as I missed it in Topkapi Palace. It was interesting to see the number of rooms in the Harem, but these are \"modern\" day rooms rather than the mysterious Harem in history. Worth going to if you have the time.In the back, there is a small aviary and pond, which would be fun for kids. There were guinies, ducks and ducklings, and peacocks! One warning - there was a creepy attendant in the Crystal Pavilion who was offering ladies to take a picture of the piano, but then he would grab them and give them big hugs and kisses on the cheek. One last thing - about 15 minutes away, near the Shangrila, there is an area called Besiktas. It is a very local shopping area with fast fashion cheap women clothes, a lot of restaurants, some food prep shopping (meat stores, supermarkets, etc), some dollar stores. I liked it because it felt very local, and I found the pomegranate syrup I had been looking for."

Built on the shore of the Bosporus, a palace built to impress and on first impressions that what it does. Built in the European style which makes it stand out from the other sites in Istanbul. Best way to get there is by tram to Kabatas and a 10 minute walk along the sea front. Closed Monday and Thursday and not included on the museum card, no photography allowed. No solo entrance only as part of a group guided tour, these tours in English and Turkish last about 45 minutes for each section of the palace. Which means waiting in line outside the building for 20 to 60 minutes (in the sun or rain) for a tour to begin and this queuing applies to both parts with a separate tour for each. Before entering the palace, you put plastic overshoes on to lessen damage to the palace floors but as you follow a carpeted route this seems a bit pointless. The tour rushes past rooms which may be of interest to you and concentrates on the main rooms. The marble columns are not marble but wood and plaster painted. The picture galley on site is worth a visit and if you are there in the late afternoon you can see the bird round up as they try to get the peacocks, golden pheasant, chickens etc back into their pens for the night."

If you come individually (not in a group with a guide) be prepared to wait a little until they do the next group of individuals. The group has to be escorted by a guide they assign. They post the time so you will know. Groups with their own guide go straight in ahead of you. Keep close to the guide once inside or it may be difficult to hear what he/she is saying during the tour.

The last royal to live here was the sultan Caliph Abdul Majeed Efendi. It is a very luxurious European style blended with Ottoman-architecture palace overlooking the Bosphorus with fascinating views and very well organised beautiful gardens. The Sultans and their harems lived a lavish life here and it has the worlds largest chandelier which is made of crystal and located in the center Hall. We found furniture covered with light or thin gold, some corners and pass ways and steps made of marble, chandeliers made of crystal. It was just amazing to walk with the tour guide and listen to the Luxury lifestyle the Ottoman sultans lived in the different rooms, offices and halls.It was the Turkish leader Kamal Ataturk who first changed this palace into his home and later he turned it into a museum.The palace is separated into two main sections; the men section (selamlik) reserved for public action. And the women section (haremlik) which is a private section for the sultan's harems or family and it shows how much luxury, money and gold was spent decorations. We noticed so many crystal chandeliers all over the palace specially the famous crystal staircase. The beautiful collection of carpets were fascinating and it takes a long time just watching them. Don't miss out on the museum of paintings. This has a huge collection of amazing and extraordinary art work of oil paintings of nearly 200 ones. The paintings were done by different artist who were guests on the sultans. Just visit the museum and enjoy every piece of artwork and it may take you two days to be satisfied with the work."

All visitors are group to different groups (depends on their language) and follow their tour guides, you are not allowed to walk around in the Palace by yourself nor to take picture in palace, but outside the palace are free to stay as long as you want.

It is easily reachable by tram as it is a short walk from the Kabatas stop. The walk allows a good look at the Dolmabahce mosque and the clock tower. The palace and the harem are well worth the price of admission which comes with a mandatory tour so it feels a little crowded. I am more of a wander on my own kind of girl. For me the grounds were the most enjoyable part of my visit and the gate that opens to the Bosphorus is the photo I flew 10,000 miles to take. If you did too, wander over to the gates further down as the main gate is both crowded and obstructed. The others, while not open, are less crowded and free of staged clutter. That area is a great place to sit and watch the boats on the Bosphorus. I know many reviews advise against it, but instead of taking the tram back, I jumped on one of the hop on hop off boats that allowed me to see Dolmabahce from the water as well as the Rumeli fortress, the Asian side of the Bosphorus, and hopped off as I wished to explore."

The highlight of the tour is the Great ceremony hall which has a 4.5 tonne chandelier in the centre which was a present by queen Victoria. The rooms you pass through are extravagant and ornate. The cost to build the palace was $1.5 Billion in today's money! The outside gardens are nice but nothing special. A couple of hours is more than sufficient after which you can take the funicular train over to Taksim square and a stroll down Istikal street."

Everybody must joy the group provided by the museum (either in english or turkish). In May 2015, each group starts every 20 to 30 minutes.I can say that this is my second on the istanbul fav place. The palace is so beautiful. The stairs, chanderlier, decoration pieces,etc are preserved well and so beautiful especially the last ballroom which is incredibly beautiful. The garden by the sea is chilling. If you have a chance, take a ferry to see outside the palace. Must go there!!"

It's not the case anymore... Besides, the time of the guided tour is year after year much shorter, you cannot visit anymore some of the rooms (just take a glimpse at them from the somehow distant central aisle) and the English language of the guides is poorer and poorer.

This is the most luxurious palace in Turkey which cost 35 tonnes of gold to be built (everything is gold plated in the palace) and contributed, by its cost, to the collapse of the Otoman Empire. It nicely combines Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical styles with Otoman architecture and some parts looks really amazing. It can only be visited with a guide (included in the entry price), but there is a tour at every 10 minutes. Don't forget to buy a ticket for the Harem section too (it costs extra 10 lira) which is visited separately also with a guide. After the visit spent some time on the gardens near Bosphorus, it is really refreshing and you might feel a little bit why they were much appreciated by the Ottoman sultans,By the way, get some cash before visiting the palace. Credit cards payments are not accepted (I was quite surprised about this, because credit cards are accepted to pay the entrance to Topkapi palace, but for Dolmabah\u00e7e you must pay cash in Turkish lira)"

However the problem is bad treatment- preferential treatment for tour groups so independent travellers have a longer wait.Moreover, no photography allowed inside, each guided tour is a huge group and that takes time. Also the tour timings are not coordinated properly- after our 45 min guided tour of the palace, we had to wait 30 min for the next harem tour. All these details need fixing."

A day's trip to Dolmabahce palace was a unique experience.The queues were long.Myself and my elderly partner had to rough out the long queue for hours.They say you are better off if you book a guided tour before hand.All tourists were to wear disposable shoes over our own before entering the palace.There are English speaking tours and Turkish tours of the palace.The guide was patient and spoke with clarity.Only a selected number of tourists are allowed to enter the palace in batches under guidance of guides.This palace is the first palace built by ottoman sultan Abdul Mecid between 1843 and 1856 in European style,for residential,partly administrative and entertaining foreign guest ,ambassadors etc.It is decorated with opulent pillars,magnificent chandeliers,Masterpiece paintings,ancestor portraits,.The symmetry and perfect harmony is eye catching .The meticulous detailing in craftmanship of furnishings is so aesthetically pleasing.The gilded pillars,The plaited curtains,the Victorian era fabric of sofas,the candle bras,the fountain,the fireplaces are a common man's distant dream stuff.The carpets are beautiful and you have to walk only on the red carpet assigned to the tourists.You are not allowed photography.The apartment of the Sultan,his mother(Valide Sultan)apartment and identical four ( relatively modest ) apartments of four wives were interesting. There were bedrooms with beautiful fabric,meeting rooms,living room,study ,bathroom or Hammam throwing light on the past life.Atta Turk resided here too and the bed where he breathed his last is also seen.In short it is a dream house for all those who desire ultimate luxury and grandeur in life.I also saw the Tombs of Sultans two days later on,near Sulaimanya mosque where it was a level field for all sultans,Huram sultan et all,a marked contrast with the palace.Everything equalised in death. Dolmabahce palace is an interesting study of history and human achievements to full fill personal desires of grandeur..Strongly recommended for people who want a glimpse into dream lands.Bon voyage."

In late May on a Tuesday we didn't have any lines but there are no individual tours- so we had to wait for an English Guide through the Palace. The work is amazing and they really have left it just the way it was so you can get the full experience- so visitors get to wear blue plastic booties through the tour to avoid tracking in dirt. I really think kids may like the gardens (breathe taking) but they were all crying though the inside Palace tour- there isn't much area for them to wander. Overall I found the Palace beautiful with lots of history- we splurged for the harem tour as well and that was a great bonus. I think this could be a half to full day thing. Afterwards we are at a very reasonably priced restaurant outside next to the water- great way to rest your feet after all that standing and walking!"

A good way to understand and have a view of another culture and race is having a glimpse of their history, and the Tour inside Domabahce Palace was the right thing to do as it was the home of 6 Sultans and the founder and the first President of their Republic has spent his last days in this palace. The guided tour was very informative and it's good to note and see that the biggest and heaviest Chandelier weighing 4.5 tons is inside the palace halls. It was well worth spending a few hours there during my trip in Istanbul."

The best thing I liked is the big hall hosting Ataturk body after his death for public farewell. Generally I enjoyed it."

It was so luxurious that sultan did not move in for years, not to cause anger among the citizens. The tour is well organized, although the guy leading the first part of the tour in English could have a much better accent and clearer speech. Anyway, you'll be impressed with the surrounding park, with the entrance gates, With the exterior of the palace itself, with the sheer size of the thing, and also with the style, both from the outside, and from the inside. The luxury is almost decadent. All the banisters in the main staircase (which itself is huge) are made of English crystal, for example. The same fact stands for lamps and chandeliers. There are 40 metric tons of gold used to decorate the building (at least I thing that's what I think the guide said). Impossible to convey the impressions by the means of text, I advise you to go and take a look."

We stayed near Beyazit so took the tram T1 from there to Kabatas and walked a little bit to reach the palace. Obeying the reviews we reached there by 8.30 am and there were only around 10 people before us. After there was a rush of different groups. We took the harem ticket as well which made a 30 TL + 10 TL per person. To protect the carpets we had to cover our shoes with a plastic blue cover they gave. All the tours were guided and we were not allowed to wander around since all the things inside the palace is original. Around 9.15 am the guided tour started since we got into a big group by 15 minutes waiting. Since our baby buggy was small they allowed it inside. However, taking it up the stair and down was the only problem. The tour was almost 45 min. And then the harem tour was at 10.45 am. So in the meantime we visited the Clock museum there and took beautiful pictures from the courtyard. The palace interiors were stunning especially the chandeliers and the surroundings too. They do not allow photography \u2013 that\u2019s what I didn\u2019t like but some were clicking in the harem area since no guide was there after the brief description. I clicked some too. This palace was built towards the end of the ottoman rule and hence it was done in a completely different and modern architectural pattern unlike most monuments in Istanbul which had adopted ottoman style. Overall , I liked it."

The entrance fee is 40 lira and it doesn't include in the Muzeum pass. The palace is closed on Monday and Thursday. Keep in mind that they don't allow individual tour into this palace. You have to join the long queue and wait for the English tour before you can enter the palace. Taking photos are also prohibited.To go to this palace by public transport, take a tram to Kabatas (the final terminal) from Gulhane. Once reached the final station, cross the road next to the Marmara sea. Then just walk straight until bypassing the jetty (Bosphorus tour). Then you will see Dolmahbace Cami. And the palace is just less than 1km from the cami.Make sure to visit the art museum beside this palace. You will see a lot of beautiful paintings. Worth place to visit."

Unfortunately, the rows in front of the ticket office (only two cash desks) were rather long and I suggest calculating 1.5-2 hours for visiting (without harem) and at least 30-45min for waiting. The number of visitors during the day is limited so as not to damage the Palace by too many visitors. My advise will be to come earlier in the morning as soon as the Palace opens at 9h. We bought a ticket for visiting the inside of the Palace (Selaml\u0131k-Tour), which included a ca. 30min guided tour with a group of 50 other visitors and costs 20 lira. The tour was informative and interesting, but quick and a little bit pricey for that short time. I only wished the staff would have formed smaller groups and let us enough time to see everything.

The large groups make it difficult to hear at times and the lack of freedom to explore takes away from the experience.

Tucked away from the crowds, the Be\u015fikta\u015f' waterfront palace was the Ottoman Empire's central port and provided an opulent administration center. Featuring the world's largest crystal chandelier weighing in at 10,000 pounds, (a gift from Queen Victoria) entering the grand foyer offers only a teaser of what's to come. Although I enjoyed touring the Topkapi Palace, if I had to choose, I would visit the Dolmabahce instead."

It has large grand open areas and very beautiful spaces that one can only imagine how the Sultan and his family lived. The place is in an excellent condition and is very well maintained.The problem that we experienced is that there were no marked areas inside the first section to enter. This is where you present your ticket to the staff, the staff will scan and then you will enter.So what happened today is that people started to walk in without presenting their tickets and the staff at the door of the palace started to scream at tourist and create such a scene. Many people don't understand English and I actually felt very unsettled as the staff member went on a complaining session for a few minutes after that. She was complaining with hand gestures and high tones. My kids were asking me why was she so angry and this really was not acceptable. This set the tone of the tour and a tourist asked one of the guards a questions and in a very rude way he said \" I don't Know\" and walked away. Secondly, please correct me if I am wrong but I did not see any signs that said no photography. This was only mentioned to us after a staff member shouted at a lady and then the tour guide mentioned the rules.Thirdly, the guided tours are too big and there are too many people that are in each tour so when the guide speaks , if you are at the back, you cannot hear. There was such good information that we could not hear properly as people kept talking. Maybe the guides should have a PA system that would enable them to be heard properly.The Harem tour is another separate tour and on this side of the palace the vibe was so much more lighter. The staff were so friendly and assisted tourist with any questions. The male guide controlled the crowd and it was really a lovely guided tour. I enjoyed this part of the visit much betterAll in all if you can you must visit this site as its really worth the time."

The last queue is particularly annoying (and not because it was raining/snowing/sleeting today) because that's when you realise that there are no individual visits, only groups. Hence you wait for the next guided tour to start. Turkish speakers are let in first (there must be a lack of English speaking guides or it could be a lack of local visitors). When they finally let you in, the crowd makes a dash for the door - if you didn't manage to put on blue 'shoe condoms' while waiting on the slippery stairs you miss your turn.Once in, you and about 40 other visitors are accompanied through the palace by a guide. The guide doesn't speak much - he spends most of the time telling off visitors for taking photos. Yes, photography is not allowed (for no apparent reason). He also rattles off names of various sultans (without elaborating on who they were or what their significance was); genuinely insightful comments are delivered in broken, sorry! - global English (\"the sultan has four womanS and 38 childrenS\").On a more positive note, the Harem is worth extra 10 liras (YTL40.- instead of YTL30.-). Despite what the name may suggests, this part of the palace is related to the more recent Turkish history (Ataturk's life and death).In sum, it's not clear why visitors cannot just wander around by themselves and need to be taken in groups."

The palace itself, with hundreds of rooms, many of them much larger than an \"ordinary\" McMansion's footprint, and ornate carvings & decorations, isn't the sort of place I would enjoy living in. It apparently killed many of the sultans who succumbed to tuberculosis from the chilly winters. But before they bit the dust, they certainly lived in sumptuous luxury. You can easily imagine the receptions with ambassadors from all over the world, the family meetings, the Turkish baths, the soirees in one or another apartment in the harem. We enjoyed the visit."

Me and my husband after visiting harem ( guide tell u a bit story about sultan and history of harem at first and then all group walking around exploring different rooms. All takes around 40 minutes) just wondering around making pictures. Unforgettable experience ! We stay in European side so to get to the palace which is on Asian side we took tram. Last stop takes u literally 5 min from palace. The easiest way is to buy travel card from local shop and top up next to tram stop. Is very cheep way to travel especially if u stay in Sultanahmet or any other place on European side. Card is valid for metro and busses a swell.Have fun exploring:) Must see while in Istanbul :)"

Istanbul has two major palaces; this one, dating from the 1850s, is just like any other palace in Europe, with lots of ornate gilded chairs, fancy carpets and big chandeliers.There are certainly some things worth seeing here - the 'crystal staircase' which has glass balusters supporting the handrail, and the massive 'Great Hall'. But most of it is just a succession of fancy rooms.You must go on a guided tour, you're not allowed wander, and there are two separate tours - one does the State Reception Rooms and the Great Hall; the other does the Sultan's private quarters where he and his family lived. If you have time for only one, pick the Reception Rooms one. Also included in the entrance fee is a small clock museum. If you pay for both the guided tours you can also see a rather mediocre 'paintings museum'."

Also the clock museum displayed a few very gaudy creations, and there were other bits and pieces to make for a satisfying morning across the Bosphorus from old Istanbul. The painting museum was very good too. The restaurants, one inside and one outside, provided surprisingly good fare and rest for aching feet after the trip. On the whole, the visit was a good contrast to the Topkapi which ante-dates this by about 2 centuries, and shows its age."

You actually get a better idea of how the \"modern\" sultans etc. lived than you do at the Topkapi Palace. At least when we were there, there was quite a wait for an English language tour, but it was worth it (and you can't go into most of the buildings except with a guided group). There is also a guided tour of the harem, also worth it. The whole thing takes several hours, so be prepared to spend some time."

Unlike today's Turkish prime minister, it it so humbling to know that out of all those hundreds of lavish rooms he chose to use only 3 modestly furnished ones as his living room, bedroom and bathroom.

It was home to 6 Sultans 1 Caliph and it was where Mustafa Kemal AtaTurk died. The guide in the Selamlik (administrative) part of the Palace was very informative. This in my opinion was the best part. The Harem, the Sultans private quarters, was good but not as opulent. The gardens over look the Bosphorus and in the summer I should imagine it is very pleasant walking around outside. But it was snowing when we were there and very cold. When we finished the tour of the Selamlik we walked around the outside of the palace to take the Harem tour only to be told that we would have to wait for 30 minutes for the next tour but we could get some refreshments in a conveniently located cafe!

The tour was a little disappointing. For some reason no photos are allowed though the palace hasn't been used regularly for many years. It is certainly a monument to excess, from the 1.5 to the 4.5 ton crystal chandeliers to the alabaster marble to the endless rooms with endless chairs. The tour is $30TL for the palace and an extra $10TL for the harem. I would skip the harem, the private quarters of the Sultan and family as it is just more of the same after the main palace. Once you have seen the Great Room, with the huge chandelier that apparently is like a sun when lit but wasn't lit for the tour, and the Crystal Staircase it gets a little repetitious and everthing is getting a little worn. Well worth a visit."

The palace is situated on the Bospherous Strait and just a couple of stops on the tram from the Galata Bridge.The palace is beautiful, it grand, it's what you expect a palace to be and more. The grand ballroom took my breath away without exaggeration - I have never seen such a grand room in all the palaces I have visited in Europe. The chandelier is 4 tonnes in weight and made of crystal, the ceiling is hand painted and an impressive 36 meters, the palace of Versailles does not come close to this grand old lady. It's welll with a visit.Now the bad part, the entrance fee is exspensive - 40 Turkisk Lira for that you get a guided tour, no one is allowed into the palace without a guide. Well this is not really a guided tour, the guides rush you through, are impatient, and in the Harem, the guide left us and disappeared and we did not get to see the 3rd floor where the concubines lived. To his credit the guide in the Harem was much more knowledgeable and informed than the guide in the palace administration area.When you buy your ticket you can buy one for the Palace and Harem, but after the Palace tour they tell you the Harem tour is every 20 minutes, 20 minutes Island time, more like 40 minutes.Don't plan on racing down here as a last minute stop before you race onto something else, the bureaucratic nonsense that occurs between the officials who run the palace is a joke, anywhere else in the world these people who be sacked for incompetence"

The main building is sufficiently impressive that with decent signs it would be enough for you to walk on your own (the signage is very poor).The \"Harem\" really did need a bit of explanation but all you got was a 2 minute chat. The current Turkish government seems intent on erasing the memory of Ataturk and this was painfully obvious here where a few small signs were all you saw about the place where the founder of the Turkish republic met kings and world leaders and ultimately died. An astonishing place, but a dreadful experience. I couldn't in good faith recommend this as a place to visit until the tours have been entirely reinvented."

Some years ago a receipt was found certifying that the chandelier was actually bought. At the time of our visit some rooms were closed for visitors, incl. the imperial bath.

I think it is better to arrive at 9 to avoid the people, or simply avoid the Christmas/new year period where there's an upsurge in volume. They make you wear plastic bags over your shoes before entering. There are 15 to 20 mins wait for each compulsory, scheduled tour to start, so you need to be patient. Other reviewers said to get to the front of the line in order to hear what the guide is saying because he is so soft and there are so many people. Now I think that is just silly advice. For these reasons:1) the guide in the main tour doesn't speak good English anyway . . . Most people could not make out what was being said and 2) the information revolves just around years and names and what room this is. Unimportant stuff that you are not going to remember anyway. My advice is just quit the jostling to get to the front, walk slowly and enjoy the sights of the opulence in the palace. However, after the first few room, every room starts to look the same, especially with a robotic and bored looking guide.By contrast, the harem tour has lesser things to see and much less opulence, but the guide was waaay better at explaining and really loud and enthusiastic. We suspect the better guides get sent to the harem, since it's more exclusive, and the lousy ones are assigned to the main tour. If you are here, recommended to take the harem tour. If you have other sights to see and do not have time, it's ok to give this place a miss. Takes about 3 hours including wait time for queues."

The Harem was not as impressive as I had hoped however it was more memorable than the one at Topkapi. They should consider allowing tourists to have unguided tours of the harem and administrative buildings so that visitors can truly appreciate the history. Consider audio guides as the two short speeches given at the harem were a true waste of time.Sadly another landmark in turkey that tourists are herded like sheep and miss a lot of detail."

However, the tours on which one must be taken in order to see the palace are poor, giving little insight into the history or the architecture of the palace, and given in English by personnel not especially fluent in the language.

Also, if taking small children, do note that the tour is quite hurried and the organizers fussy and unhelpful to the point of being rude while hurrying you on, so the kids (and you!) may not appreciate the same. The harem guide, however, was much clearer and led a lovely tour. She also entertained questions and did not hurry people so everyone had a chance to absorb everything. There was a lot of confusion regarding when and where the harem tour would start, though and we were made to walk up and down the colossal grounds three times by the museum staff. No place to sit down for a minute except for one cafe. Overall a must see in Istanbul."

We ended up in the fabulous main reception room, where you could enjoy a good half hour just on the amazing chandelier and ornate columns and ceiling, but we got one minute on seating arrangements (no one could sit higher than the sultan) and then told \"the story is over, good bye.\" When we continued to stand there for a second, trying to both appreciate the room and understand what we just were told, our guide said \"seriously, the story is over, bye bye.\" Amazing. As far as the facility overall, I agree with Tom M about the deferred maintenance and the poor signage. It is too bad, this is a real treasure that is being abused.

The guides weren't especially exciting but they covered the essentials and were clearly very knowledgeable. The main palace is stunning. Important as its function was to impress foreign statesman and dignitaries. It is fascinating to see the rooms that still maintain the original furniture. Of particular importance is the most impressive final room where Atat\u00fcrk officially declared the start of the Turkish Republic. His speech is written in Turkish at the side.The Harem is less impressive but also well worth a visit. Here you can see Atat\u00fcrk's rooms where he lived and died. The clocks in his room are still set to his time of death. It's such a privelege to be able to visit such a private area. Many of the rooms are also available for viewing providing valuable insights into life at the palace. We finished by heading to the Picture Museum.

            "review": "Beautiful Palace...Horrible Tour. It's really a shame that a palace of this magnitude and beauty has been done an enormous disservice by the bureaucrats and functionaries in charge of showing it to the public. It's almost as if these folks thought long and hard about how they could make a tour experience so negative that it would actually detract from the experience of the site itself.After being herded through a tiny 'security' building with a metal detector tourists meander through the front courtyard with the beautiful swan fountain and up the staircase for entry into the building. Signage is poor and so we observed numerous people moving from one side of the staircase to the other only to be told that one side was for groups. The 'security' types relaying this information were anything but courteous. The crowd on the steps was composed of various language speakers but there was no effort to group them into tours for specific languages. We finally heard someone towards the front say something about an English tour so we joined a group of what must have been 50 or more who were entering the building. We could see a tour guide walking at the head of this large group. He talked as he walked but did not turn to address the group and we could hear nothing. As the tail end of the group entered a particular room or area he was already heading out to the next place as if there was a timer for each room. When the group did get to a room large enough for everyone to fit in, he would begin talking without waiting for the entire group to get into the room and he would talk in a normal conversational tone as if he was giving the tour to the 10-12 people closest to him. Then he would rush off to the next stop. We finally just gave up trying to keep up and catch a word or two and decided to just try to see as much as we could. Again, signage and explanatory materials are absent so even a self-guided tour is impossible. What the tourism office has invested in here are a number of very zealous 'security' types who dash about yelling at anyone with a camera or cell phone who looks like they may be taking pictures (with or without flash). The interior of the building has been poorly maintained and parts are alarmingly shabby. We were finally dumped out at the rear of the building facing the Bosphorus and actually noticed a sign pointing to another adjacent building and another tour. We followed these around to the front of the building (the Sultan's family and assorted concubines lived here as opposed to the state-function oriented elaborate first building). We got in another line outside the building and had the same 'guide' experience, this time by a woman with a thin, non-projecting voice who also seemed to be under some time pressure to get through each room as quickly as possible. The group was large and once again the guide invariably started her robot-like explanation (if you do this tour 25 times a day, 5 days a week, you'd think that you'd be able to make it 'your own' with some animation and inflection in your manners and voice) before the group was in the room and quickly charged off to the next.Our overall impression was that this was an incredible, historically rich, lavishly ornate facility that had been allowed to deteriorate badly and which was horribly presented to the public. The grounds around the palace exhibit the same shabbiness (weeds, uncut grass, algae filled fountains and ponds, flower beds unplanted, etc.). We strongly advise that the visitor take the time to read about the palace and obtain a tour book ahead of actually visiting. That would allow the visitor to know a bit about the palace and fill the gaps that are not provided by the 'guides'. Having seen palaces and similar buildings throughout Europe, England, and America we know that the tour experience can be 'world-class' to match the caliber of the site. It's time to totally scrap the current 'tour' system used here and design a new, customer-centric one that does justice to the facility. We wish, too, that Turkey would increase the budget for restoration and upkeep of this national treasure."

Rich interiors combined with the history of the place ,and it's interesting of apparently a little overindulgent inhabitants ,made for an excellent trip . Would recommend ."

However he was not allowed to take us into the palace as we had to use their own guides. That for me was the real disappointment of the tour as we were in a group of about 100 walking around with an official guide who did not really care about the tour. As there were so many people in our group, moving from one room to another took time and by the time we reached the next section, she was already in full flow with the commentary. So we tried to move up the line to be closer to her for the next section, but it was too noisy to understand all that was being said.This is really about getting as many people through the exit doors as quickly as possible."

Best to read up about this place before taking the tour. Come early as there will likely be a long line getting inside and take note that a security checked will be done before you are allowed into the palace grounds. So dont bring any drugs, firearms, explosives or your mother in law. You are only allowed to go inside the palace if you are on a guided tour. 32 tons of gold was used in its constructions and you can see it in the finer details of the palace. Some of the highlights of the palace are the crystal chandelier in the grand ballroom which is said to be a gift from Queen Victoria herself and is the biggest crystal chandelier in the world. The ballroom itself is huge and is simply magnificent. other highlights include the all-marble hammam baths (there's six) the gate of the Sultan and the treasury, gates to the Bosphorus and the fabulous Dolmabahce clock tower. No photography is allowed inside the palace."

Most people tend to go to Topkapi which albeit amazing, I recommend this palace over Topkapi. The grandeur of the place is magnificient and seeing the room where the great Ataturk died is a heartfelt moment. It is a guided 40 minute tour and access to some not all rooms are permitted. It's situated right on the Bosphorus and a great way to enjoy the views of Istanbul and soak in the atmosphere."

This attraction is well worth the visit, but manage your expectations in advance.I visited Dolmabahce Palace in early November 2014. In a nutshell, the Palace is worth seeing, but I could have skipped the Harem. The organization and structure of the tours is terrible. However, this does not detract from my recommendation that you visit. I attended alone and not as part of a tour group. If you have your own guide, your experience may differ.The Palace is very beautiful and is located on a prime spot on the river. Unlike many royal palaces, it retains its original contents. The Sultans spared no expense in decorating the palace and the chandeliers and gold work are completely over the top. Unfortunately, no pictures are allowed inside the Palace, but there are great photo opportunities on the Palace grounds.In order to see the Palace and the Harem, you have to buy separate tickets. The Palace is much more impressive so if your time is limited, just see the Palace.To see either attraction, you must join an organized tour. The tours appeared to only be in English or Turkish. When I was there, there appeared to be one each hour for each of the two main attractions (the Palace and the Harem). The tour provides very limited information and the group is very large. The format is more to provide access to the buildings in a supervised manner. Hopefully someday they will allow visits with audioguides and abandon this ineffective approach.On my tour of the Palace, the guide spent more time reminding people that we were not seeing the Harem and that if individuals did not have a Harem ticket, they would not see the Harem. She kept discussing what was in the Harem and then would remind us that if you did not have the Harem ticket, you would not see the Harem. It would have been nice if she used the limited time (the tour lasts 30 minutes) to provide more information about the Palace. Given the tour is only 30 minutes, it is very rushed.However, despite the limitations resulting from the approach taken to the tours, I strongly recommend seeing this attraction just to see the inside of the Palace.Getting to the Palace is easy. You can take a tram from Sultanahmet directly to Kabatas. From Kabatas, just walk along the river and the Palace complex will be on your right along the river. Or you can take the furnicular down from Taksim station. Either trip costs one token (four lira) which can be purchased at the tram stops.If you do make it to the Palace, a short walk will take you into a really nice neighborhood with great cafes and shopping. If you walk to where the W hotel is located (ten minutes from the Palace) and walk up above the hotel, there are a lot of trendy, fashionable shops and restaurants."

Only on the exterior.The staff doesn't care at all for the visitors everywhere. From the entrance till the exit. We feel being ripped off as we bought the ticket which allows you to enter in every region of the palace (40 Lira around 20 euros each) and because of the ques and the bad organization we didn't enter anywhere.Apart from this the building itself is gorgeous and a diamond of architecture near Bosporus with great views but there must be more attention and more organization.Better stay away!!!"

The setting is beautiful but the inside is just missing to show the way of life of that time. In The Harem section you rush through a simpler version of endless identical rooms, and wonder if these people were just sitting and talking all day long cause that is all you see - numerous sitting areas with no personality or meaning? If there was any thinking behind they would had arranged at least one living area fully and show us how people lived, what they used etc, where they ate, where their kids lived, their servants etc, or what the kitchen was like. Instead it is just endless sitting rooms. Very boring."

It is a beautiful place which shows a dazzling display of eclectic but luxury and comfort style with which the sultans lived in the old Ottoman Empire. To highlight, the incredible crystal chandeliers that adorn almost all the main rooms, but even more is the one found in the ceremonial hall, it's a pitty that it stays turned off all the time. The style is a bizarre mix of baroque and Ottoman architecture are but still, it dazzles with all the little details like ceilings decorated with gold leaves.. The view from the Bosphorus door is outstanding. One negative is the guided tour, imposed and included in the entry ticket. The accent of the translators is so strong and the acoustic of the place does not help; the result is a poor speech difficult to understand. Anyway, it's a must if you go to Istanbul."

The tour parties are large and you can't always hear what they say but there is no other way to visit. The palace is enormous and there are lots of stairs and no lifts. Not suitable for disabled visitors. The best bit is that the palace has been left as it was more or less when Attaturk died. The wealth needed to build and decorate on this scale is hard to appreciate given that they had to take loans to build it. The Harem tour is much less impressive and you do get some time without a guide to view the rooms at the end but it is frustrating that the rope barring access is at the outer door of each room and you have to strain to actually see into the rooms. The chandeliers alone are enormous, stunning and worth seeing. The Sultan's side and the great hall are possibly the most impressive I've ever seen anywhere."

The palace provides a fascinating contrast to the earlier Ottoman historic sites in Sultanahmet.It is worth a visit. It is a real shame and a frustration that the \"organisation\" of the visitor's experience is also a contrast. After queuing, a foyer crush and long wait, a mass of people surged after the English speaking guide who raced through the building without waiting for her huge group to arrive at each destination before sharing a brief explanation in a voice that reached few of the group, competing as she was with yelling children and conversations of nonEnglish speakers.I would suggest some of the entry cost could be used for a microphone, or more guides and smaller groups. I read with envy the wonderful things some other reviewers admired. We didn't get time to appreciate these wonders in the 20 minute race through."

Most famous are the world`s largest Bohemian crystal chandelier and crystal staircase (it`s actually only partly from crystal). The palace itself is a mixture of styles but what makes it worth a visit is a fact that it has survived intact with its original decorations, furniture, carpets and everything else. Though the formal part of the palace was very grand, I liked the more intimate harem more. Especially the blue and pink halls and sultans two bedrooms \u2013 the sultan had separate bedrooms for summer time and for winter time. And all the \u201cguestrooms\u201d, which were actually for harem women, because no guests were allowed to the harem.And since I'm a great admirer of Aivazovsky \u2013 the painting museum in the crown prince palace was a great pleasure.Dolmabah\u00e7e palace is close to the Kabatas tram station, no more than a 5 minute walk along the Bosphorus. Ticket costs 40 TL. And there are separate lines inside for the formal part of the palace and for the harem. You tour in groups, so you have to wait until it`s time for English-speaking group. We were lucky and our guide spoke very good and loud English."

From the beautiful entrance with the big fountain to the interior of the palace and its priceless furniture and ornaments to the amazing view, this place is breathtaking. The reason I gave this attraction 3 stars, is the poor management. We had to stand in line for more than 30 minutes to get the tickets. In other attractions, they had couple of machines where you can use your credit card and not have to stand in line but not this one. Then after that ordeal of getting our tickets, once w got inside, we had to wait for a guide. You can't tour the palace on your own. Normally, this won't bother me, except that, there was nobody there to organize the process and to make sure that whoever comes first, should go first. Once a guide was available, they open the gate, and people rush inside like a heard of cows. If you are not fit, you can easily lose your turn and get pushed to the back. And once you make it inside, the whole tour was less than 25 minutes!!! Not enough time to absorb all the beauty, wealth and history this place holds between its walls!!"

We did not use a guide, and were better off for it. One really gets to see as to how the Sultans lived in those days. Some of the rooms in the Harem reminded us of the rooms at Versailles Palace, Paris. A must see attraction in Turkey."

The Dolmabahce Palace is truly stunning, especially the Great Ceremonial Hall which is almost of cathedral-like proportions. Clearly no expense was spared in the construction, with enormous chandeliers, a crystal figure-of-eight staircase and a crystal pavillion in the grounds. You are not free to wander through at your own pace, but tours leave ever few minutes. Howver, the organisation of these tours seems chaotic with completely unmanagable numbers of guests being taken briskly around the rooms. In fact, the behaviour of some of the visitors and their children was appalling (one child just walked under the banner and rolled around on an antique bear skin - his parents were engrossed in their own conversation at the time) so it was difficult to hear the guide and must have been disspiriting for him when 80% of the people on the tour weren't paying attention to him.The tour of the harem had equally large group sizes, but was equally interesting, although nothing could compare with the wow factor of the Ceremonial Hall of the main palace. The guide for the harem did a much better job of keeping control of the group and was very clear and knowledgable.There is also a painting museum which showcases the artists brought in by the Sultans to be offical painters. To my eternal shame, I have forgotten the name of a Russian painter whose seascapes were amazing - really capturing the translucence of the water.All in all, it is definitely worth a visit, but they really need to rethink how the tours are conducted."

While we had to defer to tour groups, we did manage to get in fairly easily and pick up an English tour. You cannot take pictures inside the Palace.Although the Dolmabache is not on the scale of Versailles or Catherine's Palace in Tsars\u2019 Village, St. Petersburg, it is very impressive in it's own right. Massive crystal chandeliers, a beautiful crystal grand staircase, detailed flooring, objects from all over the world, the palace is a breathtaking experience and at the end, you do wish you had some pictures that captured the beauty. The furnishings of the palace are all original - which makes it an even more personal experience as you are not seeing replications or interpretations. The grounds are nice and the view of the Bosphorus reminds you where you are - at the confluence of Europe and Asia. And right across the Bosphorus is the old Topkapi Palace, and of course, you need to visit both to really compare and contrast the two. In fact, it is very easy to get the T1 Tram from the Dolmabache over to the Sultanahmet section.Well worth the visit, I hope you go!!"

It is easy to reach - just take the tram to the last stop Kabatas and walk for about 5 minutes. The issue we had was the tour. It is a guided tour round - you cannot go round on your own and it is only done in English or Turkish. Consequently there are very large numbers on the English tour - most of whom don't have English as a first language so they chatter amongst themselves. The guide we had spoke in very accented English and just reeled of facts in a rote fashion but all the chatter around us made it impossible to hear most of what he said. The groups really need to be smaller or they would be better letting people go round on their own with an audio guide. There is also a rule of no photos etc but this was blatantly ignored by some people and the guide did nothing about it. The Harem section afterwards was better - you have to pay separately to go into this bit so the group was smaller but the guide was better too so we could at least hear some of what was said. It is worth the visit but it would be better if they could look at how the tours are run"

You can only go as a group tour here with an English speaking guide who explains the whole history, no worries if you are a solo traveller, just join a group it consists of around 30 people. The palace itself is very impressive and is very different to Topkapi Palace (where all the previous Sultans lived - only the last 6 Sultans lived here before the Ottoman Empire collapsed). It is a very beautiful building and the outside gardens are impressive too and right by the sea - however I still preferred Topkapi Palace as there was something about that which was true Ottoman style whereas this palace is more newly built and its style is less Ottoman and more Western, maybe a sign that the Empire was in decline now and had lost its once amazing legacy. Anyway, still definitely worth a visit."

With lush green gardens surrounding the palace, the path leads to stunning mass of a building. This sultan's palace is my one key recommendation for Istanbul! Personally prefer it to Topkapi. The queues get a bit long as you wait for the guided tour included in the price on either English or Turkish. Probably recommend going earlier to avoid the queues, perhaps as the attraction opens at 9. One of the more expensive attractions to enter, 40TL for the palace and the Harem, but I think it's pretty good value for money.This palace is a stones throw from Kabatcas tram stop, just past the mosque, a short 5 minute walk away.Go and see it for yourself!"

In the end they took it way over the top and made this huge Baroque palace covered with crystal and some of the most amazing chandeliers.The one downside is that it is only guided tours, which are not the best when you want to soak in as much as you can, because they do tend to herd you around quickly to stick to schedule"

The visit requires quite a long time queuing so get there early. The visit is rather rushed and whipped along by some women you would not want to tangle with, especially the one in the ballroom the day we were there! Opulence everywhere; grand staircases, carpets galore, furniture, the gardens, the views, etc etc. The ballroom is the highlight (it was for me, anyhow).

If you're looking for something to do on the other side of the water away from the main attractions in Istanbul, than I would recommend checking out Dolmabahce Palace. It is straight 10 minute walk from the tram along shaded paved sidewalk and you cannot miss it because of the elaborate gates. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained and it is located right on the water so you get really nice views of the Bosphorus. Since the tours are grouped by language, you may need to waste some time wandering around the grounds. Everyone is required to wear covers over their shoes (they are provided) so just be prepared to walk about with shower caps on your shoes when you enter the palace. The tour itself is okay but it is definitely nice to see how the last extravagant days of the Ottoman Empire were spent. I have to say the chandelier in the reception hall is very impressive. It was a gift from Queen Victoria and is the largest crystal chandelier in the world (or so they say). We went first thing in the morning and the crowds were not too bad. Plus the weather wasn't very hot by then so it was slightly cooler."

Well worth viewing the main reception room at the end of the main tour, as this room is incredible and contains the largest crystal chandelier in Turkey. However, the tours which are a requirement could be greatly improved. First, the entrance to the main palace where the tours begin is very disorganized and extremely uncomfortable. Once with your tour, depending on the language you speak, the tour guide at least in our case (English) was not good, as she was extremely difficult to understand and spoke in a very robotic manner that was unclear. Second, they very clearly state that cameras are not permitted; however, at least on our tour, many were sneaking around and taking photos anyway. Finally, the temperatures in the palace during the tour are very uncomfortable, it is also difficult to understand how this beautiful palace and its furnishings can be well preserved without some type of air conditioning. Would recommend a visit to this palace, notwithstanding these issues, including enjoying the gardens and grounds surrounding the buildings."

We visited Dolmabahce Palace 2 years ago and found this palace beautiful, with the palace guarded by soldiers which was part of the beauty of this palace. Currently there is quite a bit of restoration work going on so all rooms are not opened to the public. All tours whether part of a guided tour or individually must be undertaken in groups. We found the English speaking guides understanding of English a bit hard to understand (Tours only available in Turkish & English). If you are a true historian you may be let down as there was limited commentary on the majority of the tour."

We ate at a cafe on the water at the palace that was not very memorable but once we stepped inside the gates of the palace my jaw dropped. My 18 month old son was so excited to see the fountains and to feed the ducks. Very picturesque. We went on the tour of the Harem and it was really beautiful. Next visit we will go on a tour of the main palace once my son is old enough to sit through such a tour. I really really loved our visit to this palace and was completely different from Topkapi Palace. I would definitely recommend visiting both."

There was already a line before the security, then an even bigger line to buy tickets. We got our tickets and had to wait in line to be taken by a guide, which you can choose in Turkish or English. All and all it took more then a hour waiting and unfortunately it drives people crazy. They do everything to get before others and there is a lot!!! of pushing when a guide takes around 50-60 people for a tour. Like they are fighting for $1million or something..... Anyway the palace itself is really cool and worth a visit. Only too bad making photos is not allowed."

The crystal staircase is impressive as is the main hall with I think it was. 4.5 ton chandelier made if Waterford ( Irish) crystal. There is also a large ornament with a message Mustafa Kemal Ataturk had written to the young urging them to beware of the military and be prepared to take action against them.

The guards at the entrance gates looked like statues, holding their swords/guns, not allowed to move or smile, even when tourists posed next to them for photos. The palace building is on the banks of the Bosphorus, therefore also a very beautiful and peaceful setting with all the well-maintained gardens."

(That's after we paid the extremely expensive fee for just touring the palace only.) After we finally get on our tour, the poor guide could not even do his job because people were running everywhere and taking photos constantly for which we were all repeatedly yelled at for. Workers were frustrated and fed up so they just treated us all like crap even though some of us were just trying to enjoy it and follow the rules. The guide eventually gave up and just finished the tour 20 minutes before it was supposed to be over. I'm so mad we wasted our time and our money."

Why don't they get the officials of the Topkapi Palace in to show them how to do it? Or if they really want to do classy, get someone over from Buckingham Palace in London for advice, direction and organisation. We got there at 8:30 (1/2 an hour before opening time). They took our money and then kept us waiting till 10:00 as they let all the organised tours from the hotels and cruise ships in first. When we finally were allowed in the guide didn't speak very good English and definitely didn't know his subject very well. After getting us through the Palace quickly in 30 minutes we then had to wait 45 minutes before a marginally better guide came along to let us into the Harem. Then when we came out (after another 30 minute tour) we wandered into the Museum of Fine Arts (signposted the Painting Museum) which was fantastic and really worth visiting (but the air conditioning was turned off). All in all a fantastic place, but the management shames Istanbul."

We were whisked around the palace in 25 mins by a very poor guide who hardly told us anything other than it had the 2nd largest chandelier in the world. He seemed intent on just getting the group(about40 people) through the system. We went up the crystal staircase and had we not asked after we had gone up it he wouldn't have even mentioned it! It was however magnificent and had we just wandered around ourselves and had time to take in the fabulous opulence it would have done it more justice.The harem was a better tour but again no English tours until 10.40! At the end we decided to have a quick look in the art Exhibition which was a great insight into life and culture at the time and we were glad not to have missed it.The grounds are magnificent and the cafe at the entrance a great place to have a refuel at not too great an expense considering the amazing Bosphorous view."

When you at last emerge from the palace with your mind full of images of 4 ton chandeliers and enough gold leaf to sink a battleship you can enjoy a stroll in the grounds and gardens whilst coming back down to earth and contemplating (for most) your own modest lifestyle."

A great way to spend a morningHighlights- Grand staircase- Trio of English crystal chandeliers (one is 4.5 tons)- Ataturk's suite including the bedroom where he died (the clock is set to 9:05 am, his time of death)- Gardens on the Bosphorus - stunning! Make sure to see the swan fountain, main gate and gates to the BosphorusDisappointments- Organized tour - not allowed to self-guide. Tour groups are large (60+) so make sure to stand near the guide if you're interested in hearing the commentary. Tours are only in Turkish and English so sometimes it's difficult to hear the tour guide over people translating for their friends. Also, very long wait for tour to start.- No photography - they say it's to preserve the furnishings but I think it's to move to tours along since they're on a very rigid schedule. Pictures are allowed in all the great palaces (Versailles, mansions in Newport, Windsor Castle) so surprising not allowed at the Dolmabache Palace.- No air conditioning - uncomfortably hot in the palace and the painting museum. I can't imagine the heat and humidity is good for the wood furniture or oil painting. They don't let people take photos to preserve the furniture but they let it sit in humidity?Regardless of the disappointments (which we knew before we arrived), Dolmabache is a must see. Easy to get to - train to Kabatas and a quick 2 minute walk."

There was just one tickets for both areas of the palace for only 30TL, and the tour took 45 mins. There is an English-speaking guide. You have to use the guide and cannot go around on your own. Fine for me. And 45 mins was enough time.It's not problem getting a ticket when you get there early and the sun when queueing outside not that hot. We got in after a wait of c.10-15 minutes on the 09:50 tour. I would recommend for you to go and see it, but it was close to unbearably humid inside (people came out drenched in sweat), and I found the place quite kitsch and not that beautiful. But it is still part of history, it is still very grand, and the grounds are wonderful and the setting on the Bosphurus is magical. Just go early!"

We had already visited a number of places, Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya before we went to this Palace and each time we were allowed and indeed encouraged to photograph it (without flash), however here it was totally different. You were not permitted to take any pictures inside the building at all, and I really couldn't understand why. The beautiful Crystal Staircase and numerous Chandaliers would have made memorable pictures but you were only allowed into the Palace with a guide, who despite speaking English, was very difficult to understand. There was also another man (?security) following the large group of people as we progressed through parts of the building. Whilst I think the Palace is worth a visit, compared with other tourist attractions in Istanbul, I think the no photograph rule was too much. It wouldn't have been so bad if I could have purchased post cards but the few that were available were really old and dated, pale and not worth buying."

From crystal chandeliers, gold gilded wall painting, valuable gifts received from other countries, furniture, upholstery to curtains, everything oozed richness.

It is a compulsion to join the group tour with the guide rushing with the details. They host tours in Turkish and English every 30 mins. If you aren't up to speed and close to the guide you may not catch any information. The complete tour including the Palace and the Harem costs 40TL. The Harem isn't as impressive so you may decide to skip it. Do not forget to visit the clock museum and the crystal room. These don\u2019t have extra fees.

The tour guide rushes through the tour, and an official in the back pushes you along so you can't actually soak up the atmosphere of the rooms. We were forced into a mob of about seventy people on our tour. The guide couldn't be easily heard or understood, and she went so quickly that you felt as if it was a race. This is definitely worth a visit. Be sure to check out the art museum that is part of the ticket. This trip would have been a lot more fun, however, if the authorities at the palace could do a better job conducting tours."

The Dolmabahce Palace is an important sight to catch if you want to understand the Ottoman Empire, but it's a difficult place to tour. First off you have to take a group tour, no independent wandering. Tours are scheduled for specific times and you have to wait in line. The tour begins on schedule regardless of how many people are in line....in can be well over a hundred! My suggestions to best manage the visit are: First get there at 9:00 am when it opens and enjoy the grounds while everyone rushes to the first tour. Clock the second and third tour times for Turkish and show up just before tour time, waiting in line doesn't give you any advantages. Why Turkish tour? Because you can't understand the English tour guide anyway, the group is MUCH smaller and you can actually fall back of the group and enjoy the rooms without a crowd of people in front and behind you. I took the palace and harem tours....both interesting. Also, FYI, you aren't allowed to take photos inside, I think it's more to keep the crowd moving. Also look out for the Crystal room museum and clock museum.....interesting and rarely visited by anyone....no tour required too. Worth the visit if you work around the rules."

After paying, you are informed that you cannot go in on your own; everyone must go with a guide. This means you will have to wait until the next tour. In our case, the waiting area was full of people so we had to wait outside in the rain. When the tour is ready, you go along with a big group. If you are short, you won't be able to see much at all because of the big crowd around you. The guide spoke English but with a very heavy accent that made it difficult to understand anything at all, especially since we couldn't get close enough to him to hear well. The group was pushed and hurried along past many things that I would have liked to stop and look at, then in other rooms made to wait while the guide spoke inaudibly. You are not allowed to take pictures at all, with the explanation that the flash will ruin the gold. The other museums around Istanbul all say not to take FLASH photography, but here there are employees standing all over to stop anyone from taking any pictures at all. Since we are rushed past many interesting sights and we can't take pictures either, it means that you don't get to see much at all. At the Topkapi Palace none of these seemingly arbitrary restrictions were in place and the whole experience was much more enjoyable. At Dolmabahce, you will only get a passing glance around through the crowd. All in all, unless you really want to see this palace specifically, it is not worth the time spent."

This palace is absolutely stunning; both the interior and exterior. The interior is lavish and extravagant; absolutely dripping in expensive materials and metals. No photography is allowed, but the good thing is that you are taken on free tours around the palace and the tours are done in different languages, so you go on the one you want. The palace is right by the sea and the view is gorgeous and serene. Alongside the Palace there is also a small Clock Museum and other things that come included in the ticket you buy. This Palace is definitely worth looking at; the experience is unique and so special."

He must have spoken a total of six sentences and was more interested in chatting with a group of friends. What a waste of time !! I wish they would allow private guides .Even the Acropolis museum in Athens does that and I saw no breach of discipline.There were several groups of school kids that day , as a result of which the toilets were in a bad condition with nobody supervising them.

Get off at the last stop and walk a couple of blocks.Plus: A truly \"over the top\" palace, including the world's largest chandelier. This is where the Sultans moved in the mid-1800s when they wanted to seem more European and leave the oriental excesses of Topkapi Palace behind.Plus: Contrary to some other opinions here, I would say 40TL for both tours is a reasonable price.Minus: No photography inside. This wouldn't be such a problem except that the available post cards simply do not do justice to the place. Very frustrating.Minus: At least the day we went, no credit cards were accepted at the ticket windows. Check on this in advance or make sure you have cash.Minus: It's worth seeing, but the tours are hasty, as some others have observed, and the groups are large enough that it may be difficult to hear.Plus: If you have time, after the palace you can walk back toward the tram stop and take the funicular up to Taksim and the shopping of Iskitlal Street.Overall, I would say Dolmabahce is a fascinating slice of late Ottoman history to do on your third or fourth day in Istanbul. It doesn't quite compare with the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi, Bosporus Cruise, etc."

Gardens are very beautiful and lead you to another short queue waiting to go inside for the main palace.Again after 10 minutes we were inside with the English speaking guide(complete with our plastic overshoes) The group was large, perhaps 60 to 80 people, the guide spoke quickly and unless you were close to her it was difficult to hear.information was a little bit lecture like with hardly any interaction . As you are not allowed to wonder round alone or take any photos it does feel a bit rushed, but some of the rooms are truly spectacular and are worth seeing.keeping up with the guide leaves you with the option of following along quickly so you could hear or hanging around at the back and having a longer look. After the main palace you can pay a bit more on admission and going around the harem.only problem with this is that having already been round the very beautiful main palace the more basic harem is a bit of a anti climax, I would suggest going round the harem first,leaving the best until last. Overall a very pleasant experience and well worth visiting."

The palace is a nice counter to the old town andinternally looks more like a European stately home, however it is built of wood, shaped to look like stone, to keep its weight lighter as it sits on reclaimed land. It is nicely decorated and has some impressive chandeliers as well as an early example of underfloor heating. All visits are escorted and groups follow one another around on the same route - little time to stop and admire any aspects you want to view longer.We joined a separate tour for the harem (household) section - not substantially different from the main palace (as opposed to the Harem section at Topkapi which was a completely different experience). Group in Harem section was far too large for the single guide/escort, if he was sharing any points of interest we did not get them - it was more of a shepherded walk of people.If we were to go again would not bother with the Harem section."

By this time our group was about 50 people, the tour guide did not use a mircophone and did not speak very loudly, she did not let people catch up or gather round or give them a chance to look at things as we were moving (quite rapidly) through the Palace, alot of people including ourselves were grumbling about how the group was too large and we couldnt hear what she was saying and she was not allowing people to join the group before starting her talk about the next part. It ended up that we were inside for about 30 mins. Barely seeing anything. There was a lot of people complaining. We were then told the Harem tour was later. Again the same thing happened. Considering it was expensive to get in at 40tl each (there was 5 of us) I felt our money could have been spent better elsewhere, we paid 40tl each for a 30 minute rush around tour that no-one could hear."

We visited Dolmabahce Palace last week and after taking in much of the Ottoman Empire's architecture, it was such a beautiful change to see something so stunning. It's definitely worth the trip and super easy to get to (Take the tram to Kabatas and walk 5 minutes).My only complaint was the mandatory group tours they take you on to go through the palace. Our first tour through the actual palace was good, and our guide was knowledgeable and attentive to the group; however our second tour through the Harem was so rushed and the tour guide behaved as if we were inconveniencing him by being there. We were part of the last tour for the day and the guide rushed us through each area, giving the information when only 5-10 people were in earshot (the rest of the 40-50 people were still trying to catch up). He asked people to be quite when they were walking and kept asking children who were walking ahead of their parents where their mums were, as if they had no supervision.It's definitely worth seeing the Palace, I recommend staying at the front of the tour so you can hear all of the information from the guides (since some won't wait for you)."

If you are using public transportation, this place is a very short walk from Kabatas T1 tram station or If your already in the Taksim area there is the F1 Funiculer (\"Tunel\" is what the signs say) that runs underground and down to Kabatas. When I measured the distance on Google Maps, I thought it was much further, but the entrance to the palace is to the far side toward Kabatas station so it was a short walk. Because the tours inside are given in groups, you do have to wait for them to call your language: i.e. English... but I do not think I waited for more than 15 minutes total. In between the administrative tour and the harem tour there is a coffee shop/cafe that has nice sweets, cappuccino, turkish coffee, bottled water etc."

Once inside, there is another line to get into the palace tour. While you wait in line, you are required to put on booties for walking around on the palace floors and carpets. They have separate lines for tours in different languages.Inside, the palace is smaller than many of the comparable European palaces, but there is attention to detail and small intricacies that make this palace uniquely Turkish. The chandeliers are the most notable and amazing accessories.The gardens are particularly beautiful, and the view out onto the water really is royal.

Our guide for the palace was vocal about letting us know we can ask questions, but her replies were all yes or no answers so no real insight there either. Our guide for the hamam was worse. They have put UPC codes on most items, but unfortunately, not too discretely and there are areas where you feel you are in a tag sale with all these tags hanging off things. A little care into how this palace is visited would go a long way.It is easy to get to (just a couple of minuted from Kabatas tram stop) and if you are ok with just seeing and not learning too much, it is certainly worthwhile as there are some beautiful rooms and the view is great.

The harem which requires buying a separate ticket had a good tour guide and was very interesting . It is amazing that all the original items are in place.

Beautiful views of Bosporous and Golden Horn from terrace but otherwise disappointing if you've visited Versailles near Paris, Hampton Court or Windsor Castle near London or Schonbrunn near Vienna. Took English tour of palace 11 a.m. and harem tour at 12:20 p.m. Only guided tours - no free roaming inside palace rooms. Both guides had difficult to understand accents. What made it worse is the first group had about 80 people and the second about 120 (I did a rough count.) They didn't wait for the group to assemble in a spot where they began talking and the information they provided when audible or understandable was boring rather than humanly/culturally interesting. The highlight of the harem tour was seeing the bed where Attaturk died, not very interesting really. When we visited Topkapi Palace a few days earlier we were told all the harem furnishings were removed and sent for display at Dolmabahce Palace so we were anxious to see them there but there was no reference to that on the Dolmabahce tours. They definitely need to increase the frequency of English tours since they only offer English or Turkish tours. They need to make each tour group smaller and revise their scripts."

Visiting these two sites on the same day was fantastic, but after reading the other reviews, I can't help feeling that this was aided by having an excellent private guide at each of them (i.e. not relying on the guide provided by the site itself). At Dolmabahce, our guide walked us through the main palace and then the harem, carefully explaining not just what there was to see, the source of many of the items and a brief history of how the palace worked, but we also obtained an explanation of the life of the last of the Sultans, his departure from the palace with the Crown Prince and the political situation at the time. If you are not lucky enough to have a private tour booked, it is still worth viewing - the gardens and the view are extraordinary, and highlights for me included the enormous carpets, the English fireplaces, the glimpses of the rooms (such as bedrooms) which were once occupied and the crystal staircase. Really quite an amazing building, the construction of which is unlikely to be repeated in this age."

After you checked at the gates beautiful garden routes you to the main ceromonial part of the palace, called Selaml\u0131k. No free visits and personal photos are allowed. You have to wait a short while for the formation of approximately 20 persons groups for a dedicated guide to take you to the tour. This usually takes 5 minutes not more. However, be aware that sometimes you need to wait 1 or 2 groups since guided tours are in different languages and follow each other. Guides give very short but interesting information about both the building and living in the palace. You may miss some of them while you observing the magnificent ornamentation and the decoration. History and the imperial magnificence surrounds you until you come to the room in which Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk spent his last days and passed away. Bed lining is a big National Turkish Flag and the clock on the small table is stopped at quarter pass nine, that is the time which Atat\u00fcrk was officially anounced deceased. This room is very emotional especially for Turkish citizens. Last part of the main building of the palace is a huge saloon with incredible ornaments and a chandelier of 4,5 tons of metal and gold in halves. You need a time to relax your neck muscles after leaving this place since you always need to look up in saloon. More than 250 kilos of gold was utilized just for the ornaments here. After a short break at the cafe just in front of the Harem Section you may visit Harem in a similar manner, meaning guided group visit. This section is the main living area of Sultan and his relatives. Total visit was took 3,5 hours for us including cafe break. I advice this place for everyone visiting \u0130stanbul"

I will start off saying that our tour guide was amazing, friendly, knowledgeable, to the point that this is one of the only places in Istanbul where we actually wanted to leave a tip (but he wouldn't take it). They provide a 45 minute Turkish or English tour. You have to be in a group as they do not permit individuals to walk around by themselves. The cons are you will have to wait in line to be rounded into a huge group of approximately 30 or more(?) people. Not everyone will be able to hear the tour and he had to spend a good amount of time telling people to not take photos almost at every point in the palace. The interior itself was so-so and a haphazard showcase of collections and gifts from different people over the years. They desperately need a proper curator that can make all the valuables make sense in a presentable fashion. The one part of the palace that was museum-like to have items enclosed in glass needs a cleaning, proper lighting, and dusting; the setup made it all very cheap. For those who are still keen to visit the location is close to the Kabatas tram station, no more than a 5-7 minute walk. Nice view of the Bosphoros."

I handed him a 50 TL bill and two 20 TL bills for our two tickets, which should cost 80 TL total. Ticket-seller gave me my tickets without looking me in the eye; he just sort of glanced sideways, waiting for me to leave. I stood there waiting for my 10 TL change without saying anything. Several seconds later, he got sort of a smirk on his face, like \"Oh, shoot, I'm busted.\" And then he handed me my change. I hate to think that an employee at a place like this would deliberately try to cheat people, but that's exactly what we believe happened here. So be aware.The tour itself is poorly organized. (I am a volunteer museum tour guide back home.) They cram people into waiting areas where you have to put paper booties over your shoes--with few places to sit to place your booties, much less to sit while waiting for your who-knows-when tour. They don't allow photography on the tour, and readily admit that the reason for this is to keep people moving. We felt like cattle on a drive through the tour. The English tour guides were okay, but their English wasn't great and you had to listen very intently to understand them. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to understand if English wasn't your first language. Our first guide spoke in a manner of an angry schoolmarm. When the guides finish their tours, they say you can ask questions, but then bolt from the room within 30 seconds. Probably the worst aspect of this tour was that they don't bother to illuminate the lights on one of the prime jewels of the palace--the biggest crystal chandelier. I asked the tour guide why this was (the one question she took before bolting) and basically the answer was that it was too much trouble. (By the way, they do light up all the other chandeliers, no problem.)The palace itself looks rather worn with paint chipping, etc. Clearly they're not funneling their ticket money back into palace maintenance. The only positives I have for this place is it was interesting to see how the later sultans and early Republic presidents lived, and the scope of the palace was impressive. Oh, and the gardens were beautifully maintained. Maybe they should get the gardeners to take tickets and give tours."

The palace guide kept giving us language lessons, the word in Arabic, in Farsi, in Turkish, in English, to the extent that he was too hard to follow, couldn't get the thread of his talk. The harem tour had to be with over 100 people so it was a guarantee not to hear what that guide was saying! He only talked to the people in his immediate vicinity.

It has been rarely used as an actual residence for the rulers of Turkey, instead this is where they would meet foreign dignitaries. The palace has a main part and a harem. You can buy tickets on site, from a small boot before the main gate. When we visited the place they only accepted cash and no cards. However, just a couple of meters away from the ticket boot, there is an ATM. You can only visit the museum with a tour, and before entering it, you must put on protective \"bag-socks\" over your shoes. Since the palace floors are mostly made of wood, they are trying to limit the amount of wear by limiting the tour durations. This is also the reason why you are not allowed to click pictures inside (their reasoning was, that if they let people click pictures, it would take much longer to complete the tour, thus exposing the palace to more damage by use). The palace houses a 4.5 ton chandelier, just before the exit from the tour through the main hall. Once you finish the main tour, you exit the palace through a souvenir shop. The prices in the shop are more than fair, and some of the things we were unable to find in any other souvenir shops that we have visited. If you have a ticket to the harem as well, after leaving the main tour, turn left at the exit from the building, hen left again. It's a relatively long walk, and even into the harem you can only go with a guided tour, for which you might have to wait. Please note, that outside the harem, there are two separate queues for the tour in Turkish and the one in English. There is also a cafeteria in front of the entrance to the Hareem, so if the waiting time is too long, you can relax over there.There is a wonderful garden around the palace. From here you can get a beautiful view over Asia Minor, just on the other side of the Bosphorus.The harem part of the palace was a rather big let down. I think you will not miss anything important if you skip this part, since you will only get to see bedrooms after bedrooms. They didn't let us enter the bathing area, which in my opinion looked the most interesting from afar.You can get to this attraction by traveling to the Kabatas station (with tram T1 or the funicular). From the station start walking in the \"continuation\" of the tram lines (towards the petrol station), on the right-hand side of the road. After about 6 minutes of walk, you get to Dolmabahce, and you will be first greeted by the clock tower in your right. The ticketing office is officially open until 16:30, but they reserve the right to close earlier too. The Musekart is not valid for this attraction.Unfortunately, the tour's quality strongly depends on your tour guide. Do not feel shy to ask questions, for even the guides who speak little know a lot about the palace. We have so far experienced 3 tour guides, out of which one one (the first one, luckily) was truly exceptional."

The lines are indeed very long, it is quite expensive, photography is not allowed inside the buildings and the guided tours leave a lot to be desired. They will kill you with numbers and measurements, which no one remembers in the end. If you visit, you will wait to buy tickets, wait to start a tour of the selaml\u0131k, wait for other groups, wait for your fellow tour members to look at the rooms, wait to start a tour of the harem and so on. There is also a maximum number of visitors allowed every day, I think it's 3000 so tickets will sell out very fast. Organized groups and Turkish citizens are \"privileged\" and those lines will usually be shorter. However, once you get inside, you might understand these aspects. It seems that Istanbul takes great pride in this palace and everything inside and around it. It was the place where Atat\u00fcrk died and he is revered. Also, the opulence is indescribable. Where else would you find a crystal staircase, ceilings of gold and the biggest Bohemian crystal chandelier in the world? Not a lot of places, that's for sure. So this palace is truly a great treasure. The details, both on the outside and in are absolutely stunning. There are things to look at in every corner of every room. The decor is simply marvelous, the riches are mindblowing. A 40-minute tour will leave you dizzy if you just look at everything. A palace of this sort needs to be well taken care of. Preservation and restoration - expensive. Cleaning the artifacts is not an easy task. One man alone simply cannot take down a 4,5 ton chandelier and clean it in a jiffy. Thus the 40 lire entrance fee. Thus the silly plastic shoes one has to wear so that the marble and carpets don't wear down. Thus the no photo policy as a lot of people act ignorantly and use flash all the time. Thus the organized tours as a lot of people simply don't know how to behave and will run around touching, grabbing or disrespecting. You can visit both main buildings or only one of them, depending on your interest, budget and time. The harem is not as impressive as the selaml\u0131k but I personally found it worthy of my time and money. It's a great look into the Ottoman Empire of the 19th century, as it is quite different from earlier periods.The gardens are beautiful in summertime and even in the fall. You can also get great looks of the exterior by taking a boat tour on the Bosphorus, you will pass by the palace and see it as a whole from afar.  Get informed before your visit. Check out opening hours and prices, get there early and get ready to wait. If I'm not mistaken, there is wheelchair access and I also saw a lot families with strollers. I think that if you keep an open mind and ignore the few imperfections of a tour, you will definitely get a lot from a visit to Dolmabah\u00e7e. I most certainly did!"

Unlike Topkapi Palace, you could easily understand what it must have been like to live there in its hey day. The fabulous ceiling crystal chandeliers not to mention the crystal balustrades were something to behold and because much of the original furniture was still in situ the atmosphere resonated with the luxurious indulgence of its time. Included in the price was a compulsory tour guide and this was a big plus. Just a tip. Try to stay up front with the guide if you can as it is quite difficult to hear them if you are near the back of the group and sadly the guides do not have microphones. We went to Topkapi Palace the next day and were disappointed that there wasn't one there but also there was no real sense of who had lived there.Do try to get to Dolmabahce Palace if you can. It's easy to reach on the tram system and well worth the entrance fee. If this was an historic site in the UK, it would cost at least twice as much!"

Topkapi palace has its own charm, but the grandeur of Dolmabahce palace is just too great! The good thing about the visit here is that it is accompanied by a compulsary guided tour. The ticket was 40 Lira (including Harem tour, which in my opinion is a must visit) which was most expensive of all attractions we visited, but the guided tour almost covered the cost. Great thing about this palace is that it was in use until recently and Ataturk's room has been maintained as it was! The palace has a beautiful entrace, and there is another entrance which opens in the Bosphorus (unfortunately you can't use it!) which adds to the beauty of the palace. The tour lasts about 45mins-1hour and there is no place to sit in between - so be prepared to walk that much. Forget the ticket cost, just go!"

Having visited Istanbul a few years ago, we wanted to focus this trip on some of the things we had not seen or that we felt were worth a second look - first up was the Dolmabahce Palace There are two ticket options for the palace; the full tour which includes the palace and the harem, or a ticket for just the palace - we opted for the full tourWe were a bit surprised and disappointed to find that all tours of the palace are in guided groups I had visited many years ago and wandered freely. After only a short wait, while donning plastic overshoes, we were ushered into an entry hall - our group consisted of about 75 people, way too big for this kind of tour. After the first stop on the tour we gave up trying to hear what the guide was saying. The other big disappointment was that no photography was allowed inside the palace I tried a few non flash shots to test the strength of the anti-photo police and after the group was politely reminded of the policy I put my camera way. Even with all these annoying issues, I found the Dolmabahce Palace to be absolutely amazing - it is one of the most elaborately adorned palaces I have ever visited. The interior is filled with original furnishing left from the time of the last sultan - I suppose this has to do with the relatively \"easy\" transition from Ottoman rule to the Turkish republic, compared to counties like France for example.The building is basically divided into two separate functional areas; the formal Palace side where matters of state were attended - and the \"family\" side (AKA Harem which mean forbidden), where the Sultan lived with his mother, up to 4 chosen wives (any more than this had to live outside the palace but close by), other female family members and male members before they were circumcised; after they met the knife (at about age 10) they were considered men and had to go and live on the Palace side. Interestingly the sultan never actually officially married any of his \"wives\" so as to avoid giving them any legal standing they might challenge his power.Strangely, after finishing the palace tour which lasted about 45 minutes - we were required to exit the building, walk all the way around to the back, line p again, put on overshoes again and reenter for the harem part of the tour which lasted an additional 30 minutes."

Tours are available in English and Turkish. (Arabic language is available only during particular season. Pls check beforehand if this is your preferred language!). The tour guides did have an accent so make sure that you stand close to him / her. As the tour is conducted in groups, you may miss out on the information if you are not within hearing range. The administrative side of the palace is much more impressive than the harem; however in my opinion it is worth to pay for the complete tour. Harem means the residence of the Sultan and his family. Point to note is that it is located right beside the sea; hence we found it extremely windy and chilly. If you plan your trip during winter then make sure you have adequate woolens on you. If palaces are your passion then this is definitely a must see!!!"

The palace may be reached by tram or taxi from the old Istanbul area.As mentioned in previous reviews, the guides give a detailed description of every room and hall in the palace tour. It is a feast for the eyes- carpets, paintings, furniture and chandeliers. The guide had a very strong Turkish accent. Touring in a big group made it doubly difficult to understand her.Three things to look out for in this place are: The crystal grand staircase, the presidential bedroom of Ataturk which is surprisingly small and the world\u2019s largest bohemian crystal chandelier which hangs on the 2000 square meter ceremonial hall. It is truly magnificent."

To get there you will have to pay 40TL and to get inside you have to follow a compulsory guided tour which is really bad. Being there in winter was good because it's was not that crowded, in Spring the waiting time is terrible. The people running the tours hardly speak understandable English in such an environment, in a big group. Explanations are poor and it ends being a way to get people to walk fast."

Ballrooms were grand and majestic. The fountain and gardens were quaint, and we saw some exotic royal birds, like peacocks near the external Crystal Palace. The views of the Bosporus are lovely. Tickets cost about 30 lira pp to see Palace only, don't think we missed out skipping the Harem. Dec is low season so queues weren't that long. Guided english speaking tours are large so stand at the front to hear the commentary clearly. We took the metro/tram which was convenient. ferry terminal to Asia is walking distance so try that afterwards."

            "review": "Read about the palace before visiting. We visited Topkapi Palace before visiting Dolmabahce Palace. In terms of architecture, Dolmabahce Palace is clearly European influenced compared to the Ottoman-influenced Topkapi Palace.I visited Topkapi Palace with minimal understanding of Istanbul's history and because the palace is breathtaking, I was tempted to take a lot of photos and then just leave after I'm done.So before I visited Dolmabahce Palace, I decided to read about Ataturk, the Ottoman Empire and about Dolmabahce Palace. Trust me when I say this, it made the visit so much more meaningful than just blindly taking photos.The queue wasn't long at all. It took 5 - 10 minutes to buy the tickets. For reference, we visited in mid December and it was at 2pm.After we paid 30TL to see the palace (excluding the Harem), we were told there would be an English tour which would involve one guide and 30 tourists. The guide had a thick Turkish accent, but that wasn't really an issue. The problem was the volume (or lack thereof) of her voice. Combine her soft voice with the mildly noisy tourists, everyone else (especially those at the back) couldn't hear her.Again, that's when reading about the palace beforehand came in handy. Since we've paid 30TL (about GBP10) for the visit and the tour of the palace, it would be great to fully immerse ourselves in the luxurious palace atmosphere instead of being frustrated about being unable to hear the tour guide. Because I've done some reading beforehand, I wasn't too frustrated about being at the back and being unable to hear the guide.The palace itself is pristine and beautiful. The only area of improvement would be keeping the other tourists quiet and/or breaking up the tour into smaller groups instead of a large group of about 30 people."

The Palace is grand in every which way from the entry way to the crystal staircase and the pure size of the palace. It is a great contrast to the Topkapi Palace. The history of the Palace is quite unique as it is the last Palace that was ever used by a Sultan of Turkey.I only got to see the Selamlik portion of the Palace. The Selamlik is the formal part of the palace. I arrived at 2:45 and the ticket window man was a bit short and told me the Harem portion of the palace was closed. Maybe it was lost in translation (he did speak english) but he may have assumed that I would not be able to join the 3 PM tour (which I did) but I could have done both tours. The Palace closes at 5. There were no lines and I walked right in and caught up with the tour. For an extra 10 TYL I could have seen the living quarters as well which the rest of the group did. I was a bit disappointed with that.There is not an option for a self guided tour of the Palace. The tours are led in English or Turkish and the groups are separate. That being said, the groups did meet as well as with other tour groups ahead and it can get a bit congested. The experience will depend on the people in your group and mine included pushy people.You are not allowed to take any photos inside the Palace which made the tour move along but outside is a free for all.Overall it is worth a visit if you want to see rooms with wall to wall marble and staircases lined with crystal. It also houses the largest chandelier in all of Europe."

Once you get the tickets, you then queue to get into the grounds and then another queue up the steps into the main Palace area where you then need to put on plastic shoe covers.

However, if you have the time after visiting the major attractions in Sultanahmet, this is a must see. There may be a queue to contend with initially, and tour groups and locals seem to have priority, it is still worth it. The palace is fantastic. It costs extra to visit the harem but again it is worth the extra money. The detail in the walls and ceilings, as well as the furniture is mind boggling. It houses the world's largest chandelier weighing some tons. It iseasy to get to via the tram. After visiting this site, try wandering up to Taksim square which is a couple of kilometres away. Otherwise catch a bus- it is all easy. Also very cheap by taxi. When in Taksim, absorb the atmosphere. People and shops everywhere. A coffee overlooking the square is wonderful and not expensive. Also, seafood restaurants abound inthe alleyways off the main street. It makes a memorable outing for a day."

It clearly states that they regulate the flow of traffic, and preference is given to large tour groups as well as those who have reserved in advance. We were fairly early, around 10 a.m., but we still were in line to buy tickets for 30 minutes. Then yoou have to queue up again outsie the palace. Two lines form, one for tour groups and one for individual visitors. The tiur group line moves at an accelerated pace at the expense of the individual visitors. We were in line 30-40 minutes inthesecond line. There are no solo visits, no filming AT ALL. We have a Palace tour guide who made us soon forget the hassle of waiting in line and putting on booties. He spoke several languages, was acerbic, but funny. This tour lasted 30 minutes and was worth it. If you have already visited someof Istanbul, you will appreciate some of the art work with what the Blue Mosque area looked likecenturies ago, not to mention Hagia Sophia."

The palace itself was breathtaking and its architecture reminded me a lot of the western European palaces. There was a beautiful garden spread all around the property and we had fun taking pictures beside the idyllic fountains. The only negative aspect of this tour was the long queues waiting to enter the palace and the Harem buildings. Once inside, we had difficulty hearing our guide because of the huge crowd so I believe they should better manage the numbers of each group of people. The trip took about 2h and by the end of it we were exhausted but it was all worth it. This is no doubt a must see tour."

But the bed room where Atat\u00fcrk passed away is in Harem. The clock in the bedroom where he died is still set to the time of his death, 9:05.

He was more talking about himself how young he look, in fact he is 45 years old than talking about Harem. If you get the chance to go this section, make sure to ask as many questions as you can. \"Crystal Pavilion\" (FREE)Make sure you visit this hidden gems!

The entrance fee was 40 TRY per adult for a combined ticket to both the palace & harem.The procedure to enter the palace took some time because priority was given to organised tour groups, whilst individual visitors had to wait before being allowed to enter as a combined group, so that a guided tour could be given.The rooms inside the palace were enormous and lavishly decorated. It was interesting to hear some of the history about it's past occupants but after being directed from one enormous & lavishly decorated room to the next, it all became somewhat repetitive and dull. The palace tour was about 45mins and the harem tour was about 20 mins, the harem being smaller and a little less ostentatious than the palace.The gardens outside the palace are well tended and make for good photos. The palace location along the banks of the Bhosphorus is also impressive. Note that photos and videos are not permitted inside palace or harem at any time.To be honest, I would probably prioritise other Istanbul attractions above this, especially if you have limited time."

This time (November) there were no lines, but I should have taken the no-go's as a message. This is a good place to skip for several reasons: (1) It costs more than any other landmark building (for comparison, Dolmabahce was 40 TL while the Aya Sofia--far more interesting, historically significant and worthwhile--was 25 TL. (2) The tour is given in \"English\" but is barely comprehensible. The parts I did understand were not interesting, just dates and names without context. (3) Visitors must stay with the guide and cannot explore on their own or linger over points of interest. You're in and out in 40 minutes, no exceptions (though you are free to wander the grounds without time limit). (4) The palace is not in great shape: creaky wooden floors covered in threadbare carpets, crystals all foggy and dull, chipped paint, etc. A display of decorative household arts (teacups, comb and brush set, eg) was similarly unrefurbished and without labels for context. (5) Aesthetically unpleasing (subjective, I know) with a mixture of over-the-top western styles predominating (baroque, rococo) and so relentlessly symmetrical that no detail stood out as unique since it was always part of a pair or quartet of identical chairs, fireplaces, chandeliers, doors, paintings, etc. (6) Most visitors were required to wear protective booties over their shoes (I'm not sure why I and a few others were exempt). Whatever they were meant to accomplish didn't work because a gaggle of latter-day Cinderellas lost their booties along the way, leaving a trail of bright blue plastic littering our route.(7) Photos were strictly forbidden: to protect what's left of the grandeur? to censor proof of its decay? (8) The \"filled gardens\" had only one or two late-blooming autumn roses by a surprisingly modest-sized pool. Perhaps more impressive in springtime. On the plus side, there is a charming Bosphorus-riverside cafe on the grounds with a varied menu and reasonable prices. You don't need to pay for the palace if you only want to visit the cafe--just go through the security check."

My husband and I went to Dolmabahce Palace with expectant hearts, deciding we will spend our last afternoon in Istanbul to look at some lovely architecture soaked rich in history. What a disappointing trip it turned out to be! Apart from the impressive exterior and spacious gardens, the entire experience was marred by the fact we had to be guided in groups to see the interior of the palace. \"Guided\" is an overstatement as most of the times, I felt like we were just herded like sheep in a crowded production factory. The guide spoke with a dispassionate voice, his annoyance with the group evident on his face. He truly looked like he needed to change his job! The group was way too large for him to manage and his information was only available to those who were at the very front. Many parts of the palace had small corridors to see certain rooms, so a large part of the tour consisted of waiting patiently for our turns to take a quick peek at the rooms and hurrying to try catch up with the guide who had walked on ahead. After a few cycles of this, the whole tour started to feel meaningless because we didn't get to hear any information, even the rooms started to look the same. Interests soon waned among many visitors within the group, people started talking among themselves, not bothering to look at individual rooms. We started feeling like we were stuck in a human jam - unable to accelerate or turn back or end the tour. After the tour ended in the main section, we deliberated if we should proceed to the harem section. \"Maybe it will be better,\" we thought. It wasn't. It was the same procedure of jam-packed into a procession, except this time it was worse. The group was larger and it was clear they were trying to squeeze in as many visitors as they could. At the end of the tour, we walked past the guide - this time, a man who seemed more cheerful, informed and liked his job better. I wouldn't know though, I wasn't close enough to hear a single bit of information from him. Regrettably, I wished I had spent my last afternoon in Istanbul a little better."

The English tour consisted of around 50 people, most of whom didn't speak English so talked throughout the entire tour. When standing in back you cannot hear anything the guide is saying The palace has moments of great beauty mixed with moments of \"dusty old house feel\". The chandelier at the end of the tour is huge and beautiful. Don't try to take photos during the tour, you really aren't that stealthy and you will get yelled at and berated by the guide or guards. (\"do you understand English? Then why are you taking photos!?!\")(Very funny for me, not so funny for the guy trying to take photos.) The highlight, and only reason I am rating it a 4, comes after the tour when they release you into the grounds between the Bosphorous and the Palace itself. It is a great place to take photos or just to sit out and enjoy the weather. The cafe was also delicious, but be wary of the cats, they will climb on the table to get at your food even with you yelling and swating at them."

This meant we were not bumping into other groups as we went round and our guide had time to fill us in with some of the history. The rooms are out of this world, particularly the one where the chandelier presented by Queen Victoria is hanging. The palace is extraordinarily large and no wonder it led to the bankruptcy of the Sultanate. Such extravagance and opulence, quite breathtaking. The only thing I regret is that the State does not manage to keep it a bit cleaner. I was itching to take a duster to lots of the statues! I guess over 300 rooms take a bit of looking after."

However, if you don't want to see the Harem, it is 15 liras just for the Palace. I would recommend skipping it if you have already seen the Harem in Topaki Palace. The Harem there is better.The outside doesn't look too much but the interior really blew us away. Tours are guided and lasts 45 minutes. The Harem tour lasted 30 minutes and must be guided as well. The interior is gorgeous and it was really impressive. Definitely visit here if you have seen the sites in Sultanahmet before. You won't be sorry!"

Ok, so if there is any advice I'd want you to take away is to please visit this palace instead of trampling along with the Topkapi crowds. This is the palace to see in Istanbul as I've found the Rococo style quite \"refreshing\" after the simplicity of Topkapi. I've read reviews of people comparing it to Versailles, but I'd say they got carried away a little with the metaphors and epithets. Still it's definitely on the \"to see\" list for Istanbul. The location, just near the sea with it's beautiful baroque gates, magnificient stairs and exquisite Ceremonial Hall. However they do go out of their way to make you uncomfortable assigning you to a guide who's purpose I think it's to shepherd you as fast as possible to the exit. We got there early so it did not feel that was necessary, but I've seen the queue that was forming as we exited so yeah, it's definitely not possible to sit around more and look around by yourself.Also a strict NO PICTURES policy inside(which never makes sense to me as long as they don't care about blitz) and for this I pay them back by dropping the review score by -1. But do go if you have the chance!"

            "review": "Great European- style palace, bad tour. Located on the banks of the Bosphorus, Dolmabahce palace is among the most famous and distinguishable sights in Instanbul. In contrast to Topkapi, this palace was built in western- style architecture and does not differ from royal palaces in mainland Europe. Built between 1843 and 1856, Dolmabahce has been the residence of Sultans until the end of the Osman Empire. After that, it bacame Ataturk\u2019s seat of government and later, as Ankara was named capital of Turkey, Ataturk\u2019s residence in Istanbul. It\u2019s also the place where Ataturk perished in 1939. The clock in his former sleeping room still indicates the time of his death (9:05 am).Visitors to Dolmabahce palace should be aware that guided tours are obligatory. And this is my main point of criticism: I usually prefer to hire audio- guides or buy guidebooks in order to tour individually as this enables me to spend as much time as I want at an attraction. My tour guide was nice and probably knowledgeable, however the tour was rushed and I did not have any time to enjoy the beautiful decorations and furniture. In addition, there were so many people in my group that it was difficult to understand what the tourguide was talking. Besides that, rules for visitors are far too strict as taking photos is prohibited and everone had to wear protective sheets for shoes (what is not even the case at most medieval attractions).Apart from the interior, also the gardens should not be missed. I highly recommend to walk around the palace as the landscape gardening is an attraction by itself. As the palace is surrounded by high walls on one side and by the Bosphorus on the other side, one has to take a boattrip on the Bosphorus in order to see the fa\u00e7ade of the palace. In my opinion, the most beautiful view can be enjoyed from Uskudar, a district on the Asian side of Istanbul. To summarize, I enjoyed my visit at Dolmabahce palace as the architecture, interior and gardens are marvellous and the place is of high historical importance. However, authorities should really change their strict rules for visitors. Given the high entrance fee, the tour was bad quality. These points of criticism make me rate it 3 star. Otherwise, a 5 star ranking would probably be justified."

However, once you enter the palace another world completely opens up.

It is much more impressive then Topkapi Palace in my opinion. I visited with some friends on a Thursday we got a ticket straight away our tour started within half an hour. We spent the half hour walking around the beautiful gardens, taking pictures and taking in the spectacular views from the palace. Our tour guide spoke very good english and was extremely informative. The guide lasted around 40 mins but did not feel like 40 mins. The time passed by very quickly, It was one of the best places I visited in Istanbul. I would definitely visit it again and recommend it to future tourists a must see :)."

The gardens are beautiful though, but the experience is one of bad tempered security people and a dry, dry tour. In my humble opinion the Dolumbache is not a world class jewel but the grumpy security guys insist on medical-type plastics over shoes. The Vatican Palace doesn't have them, the Louvre doesn't have them and no other place of interest has them in my experience. No photographs either. Ive lots of photos of the Sistine Chapel and no flash pics from the Louvre. There is little to photograph to be truthful, but by crickey the guards are aggressively alert to anyone trying. It's room after room of dry dusty furniture and half way through I was tired of the whole thing. It was August, it was hot ok, but its August in Paris and Rome with all their treasures. Later in the week we were in Naples. We walked around the Royal Palace unhindered by aggressive guards and rooms filled with beautiful objects and paintings........and no surgical foot covering."

            "review": "poorly organized, poor tour. A recent Tuesday in August visit was most disappointing and quite gruelling. With temperatures around 37, we were forced to wait in a long queue for an hour, in the sun, to even buy a ticket, then again 45 minutes to actually enter the palace itself. It is only possible to visit in guided groups, and our group was 70 people (we counted). One could not hear most of what the guide said, and in any case, she only gave a brief introduction and then two stops en route and then thanked us at the end. It was more like a route march, in sweltering conditions, no time to stop and see anything or even read the few labels throughou the palace. Tours were provided in Turkish, Russian, and English. Naturally, the English tour attracted people of many different language backgrounds, and so part of the reason we couldn't hear the guide was that many people on the tour couldn't understand her anyway and resorted to chattering instead. Given the language mix of the visitors, at least that day, they should provide Arabic tours. But they should also train the guides in basics like facing their audience, and with a large group not standing at one end of it but closer to the middle. We then also toured the harem, and although that wait was only about 20 minutes, it was all the same problems. I found this all the more disappointing as I had visited this palace once before, February half a dozen years ago, and it was enchanting. Small group of a dozen or so people, no heat-stroke-inducing lines, and a wonderful tour with far more information and a well-paced walkthrough. I still recommend visiting, but it could be anywhere from a wonderful experience to a gruelling route-march, based on my two separate visits!"

It is over the top ottoman style which makes you realise you are in Turkey and takes you to another time. Have been to dolmabahce a few times with different visitors and cannot recommend it more. Great to see after Topkapi palace to see where the sultans moved from. I actually had a \"take your breath away\" moment in the ceremonial hall(?) at the end. Go early in the morning and if you can tee it up with a visit to the Sunday ortakoy markets for lunch."

You do have to queue for the tour which was at 10.45 in English, but this was not too long.Once in the palace we agree that the guides seem disinterested. Due to the guide speaking English with a thick Turkish accent it was difficult to understand or hear him. We stayed at the front of the tour group whenever possible to hear him. Interestingly his English was perfect and clear when he reminded us on 3 occasions Not to take photographs!Having said this the palace is opulently grand and the gardens beautiful and well worth visiting.When we came out at 12.30PM the queue for tickets was very long, and estimated about 40 to 60 minutes.

            "review": "The highlight is the Grand Ceremonial Hall. Dolmabahce Palace is great in 2 aspects: the fantastic location next to the Bosphorus and the Grand Ceremonial Hall. The moment I stepped into the Grand Ceremonial Hall, my jaw dropped at the awesome sight of the cavernous hall. The ceiling is very high with a chandelier weighing 4 tonnes which according to the guide is the largest in Europe. The ceiling and wall paintings, the columns and architecture of the hall are impressive. I agree with most of the 'Poor' and 'Terrible' reviews in TripAdvisor so I won't repeat those. I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday and I got my ticket within minutes. Compared to Versailles, the garden was not impressive and luckily, small so it was a short walk to the entrance of Dolmabahce. Near the entrance, everybody just waited and the electronic signboard will show the times for the next English- or Turkish-language tour and it was mandatory to follow a guide. They will allow private tour groups with their own guides. I waited around 30 mins and the crowd grew but the staff did nothing to control the crowd except to tell people 'no photography'. When the guide is ready, the crowd just surged forward through the guard scanning the tickets. The guide was showing signs of irritation because he had to raise his voice, to constantly ask people to respect the rules like no photography and sometimes even asking people to stop talking among themselves. People at the back couldn't hear him clearly or couldn't understand English properly so they talked amongst themselves. A Korean family even wandered off on their own and a security staff herded them back. He couldn't police everybody so some snapped photos. He even threatened to call the police if the culprits did not stop taking photograph (I am not joking!). The experience was severely marred when a toddler cried while he was speaking in the very impressive Grand Ceremonial Hall. The guide lost his temper and told off the parents. Is it not obvious that the root of the problem is the huge size of the tour group? I really don't see the rationale about no photography and the compulsory tour. In Versailles, Lourves and many European museums with famous paintings, photography without flash is allowed. The Dolmabahce guide explained that tourist could buy their postcards but seriously, the photograph of the Grand Ceremonial Hall inside their brochure did no justice to the grandness of the hall. The compulsory tour is the worst point of this palace. It is as if the administration was still stuck in the Hittite era and have not of heard of audio guides. Seriously, rent out audio guides to tourists, make them walk along red carpeted lanes (which is already the case) and cordon off areas (which is already done) AND allow us bloody freedom to roam. Make the guided tour non-compulsory and everyone, tourists and staff will be happier this way. Until then, I would suggest visitors to book private tour group to visit especially during busy period."

Up to now the chandelier was supposed to be Queen Victoria's special gift to the Sultan. But our guide said that after new research they found out that Turkey had paid for that. I can't know the truth. The fact is that it's very,very impressive.There is also a lot of history linked with the Palace and the deathbed of modern Turkey's founder and President Kemal Atat\u00fcrk is among the historical exhibits.No photos are allowed inside the Palace and the tours run very quickly because there is always long queuing outside.Even so, the visit remains an unforgettable experience.The gardens are spectacular, with amazing gates and excellent views to busy Bosphorus.

Dolmabahce was later the home of Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the father of modern Turkey. You can visit Atat\u00fcrk\u00b4s chamber, and other marvelous rooms with spectacular chandeliers and carpets. There is gold leaf everywhere. The last room you visit, the Ceremonial Hall, has the biggest and most spectacular chandelier I have seen. The place is worth a visit. From the Sultanahmet area, you need to take a tramway (which costs very little) and it takes about 10 minutes at the most to reach the palace. It is not allowed to take photos inside Dolmabahce."

We were a little bemused by the process when we arrived and eventually worked out that we could only see the palace as part of a guided tour. We had to don blue plastic shoe covers and wait our turn for about 35 minutes, and there was limited seating. The tours alternated between English and Turkish. There seemed to be some confusion as to who was on which tour. I suggest a sign in English should have directed people to blue booties and a sign in Turkish to some other colour, then we would have been immediately identifiable.I thought that the tour was too fast at the beginning but when you realised how extensive the palace was, and how many different rooms, it made sense not to dawdle. Be aware that there are lots of stairs. The European opulence (Baroque, Neoclassical and Rococo), made an interesting contrast with the comparatively sparse decorations of the Topkapi Palace. The pinnacle was the Grand Ballroom with its chandelier and very clever Trompe L'Oeil.There were lovely views from the windows of the Bosphorus accompanied by gentle breezes. The guides accent was a bit hard to understand which surprised us for such a prominent site but don't let that deter you. We were very glad that we had visited this palace."

The Selamlik tour takes a out 45 minutes while the Harem about 30 minutes.\u00a0I have two big beefs about the public tours - they cram way too many people on them and they rush through the palace providing only scant detail about the rooms, their significance and information on any artifacts (you are encouraged to ask questions).\u00a0"

All tour companies grossly overcharge for this visit. It is so easy to do independently. With the money you will save, you can buy yourself a nice souvenir. We took the tramway to Kabatas. Taking the tram is so easy and it is air conditioned.We walked along the water with the Bosphorus to our right. After about 5 minutes you will pass a mosque with very slender minarets. You have just about arrived! So easy. Plan on getting there prior to opening at 9:30 a.m. to avoid the crowds. You cannot tour the palace or the harem on your own-you have to take one of their tours. You will be amazed. The gardens are incredibly lovely. We had lunch nearby with a gorgeous Bosphorus view."

But if you have been to Versailles in France, Windsor in UK or any imperial palace across the world than you can give this a skip. The entry ticket is ridiculously high for what it has to offer. There are some good views of Bosphorous but again nothing new if you have already taken the Bosphorous cruise. The gardens are nothing to talk about. Not sure why other reviewers are raving about it. On a hot afternoon the visit can be treacherous as the palace has no air-conditioning installed."

The rooms were spectacular, and our guides for bot the main palace and the Harem were extremely knowledgeable. The grounds are lovely, as well, and it's spectacularly situated on the Bosphorus. The only reason why I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is that, while it's supposed to be open until 6, we arrived not too long after 4 and it was already closed due to a high number of visitors, so we had to go back the next day. I would recommend going in the morning to be sure you won't be shut out. Also, it is not self-guided, you must be with a group, so if you just miss one you will have to wait around for the next tour. I don't think it's a long wait, but we really didn't know that. Aside from that, it's good value for money, as the place is rather large and you get to see quite a bit of it, especially if you choose the combined selamlik/haremlik ticket, which I recommend."

When you walk into the court yard the beautiful architecture, magnificent grounds along with a beautiful oceanic view immediately hit you. Everything is immaculate and by the time you leave you will understand the fee structure to get in. You cannot wander around the inside of the palace by yourself. Tours are conducted in both Turkish and English. The tour of the main palace takes 45 minutes and the Harem 30 mins. Sounds quite a long time but the palace is massive and the tours were quite hurried. Beautiful furnishings inside along with amazing murals on the ceilings (68 bathrooms all of which have hole in the floor - yes even for his highness). Would have appreciated if a bit more time was spent explaining the furniture rather than the people. Make sure you set aside maybe 20 mins to walk around the grounds . There also is a rather beautiful crystal room which you can visit yourself ( we came across by accident). A overall a great experience."

This is a beautiful palace in Istanbul, and it is interesting to visit as it is built in a very different style than Topkapi and the other main tourist attractions. This palace was built much later than other places and has been done in a much more European style. You can visit both the harem and the business area of the palace, but it has to be done as part of a guided tour. Unfortunately, I very much disliked the tour. The guides were not well trained (in particular, they were very difficult to hear), and the tours were very rushed. You can't take pictures inside the building, so being rushed is doubly annoying because you don't have time to take in the grandeur of the rooms. The grounds are very pretty, and you can get some great pictures of the view from the sea gate along the river. If you have time after visiting all of the other main tourist attractions, I would still recommend visiting here, but I wouldn't come here at the expense of places like Topkapi, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, etc. Also, if possible, come on a day that is NOT Friday or Saturday as those seem to be the days with the most tourists (I think that's when cruise lines tend to dock in Istanbul) so the tour may be smaller."

You have to buy a full ticket to enter both buildings, other wise you'll not be allowed to enter the Harem Section. Individual visits are not allowed as well. There are guides in both buildings to organize the trips & make sure no-one touch anything in the palace. The guided-tour takes from 30-45 minutes in each building. I loved the palace as it shows the rich history of the city being the home of the last 6 Ottman Sultans in Istanbul. Great views over the Bosphours, too! Strongly recommended."

This is located on the banks of the Bosphorus River very close to where some ferries are located for Prince's Island trips. Next to the palace is a small mosque called Dolmabahce Mosque which is quite nice. It is highly recommended that you do this on your own accord rather than in a tour group which I did unfortunately. The tour guide waffled on and on and on for 3 hours and I lost the world to live and was desperate to get out of the palace but could not do so. This is something you can do within 1 hour easily without some person waffling on boring the pants out of you.

If you have doubts about maroon and olive green, or pink and lime silks, or silver-mounted elephant tusks and crystal chandeliers, come and look and be liberated from the modern taste for half-hearted 'understatement'. Dolmabahce shows that you can combine an eclectic mix of styles to make a secular cathedral of sheer visual enjoyment.

            "review": "Yet another elite extravaganza. For once, we did not visit a site on our own, but saw Dolmabache Palace with a day tour. That may have influenced our experience negatively, since our time was strictly constrained. (We prefer to explore at a leisurely pace.) However, you cannot visit the interiors of Dolmabache Palace WITHOUT being on a guided tour, so you are limited to what you can see and how long you can linger. That was disappointing to me, since my career was in architecture and my lifelong interests are design, archaeology and the history of cultures. I thoroughly research the history of every place before we leave home, and am eager to see things in depth. When I get there, I want to walk slowly through, taking the time to appreciate it and take in its details -- not be herded through as quickly as people can be made to walk. I get it that confining people to tours must help protect a place from theft or damage, and hustling them through undoubtedly allows more people to visit each day without being so crowded. But many venues we've seen in other countries (such as Versailles, Matsumoto Castle and Schloss Nymphenburg, for just three examples) allow you to walk through large areas of historic palaces at your own pace -- and take photographs. Even in Istanbul, we were able to get in line at Topkapi Palace before it opened, explore the whole palace at our leisure (taking all the pics we wanted), and then leave when the tour buses started dumping their hordes at the door. Which leads me to the \"No Photography\" rule at Dolmabache. We used to think forbidding photography was a way to force you to buy the venue's own books and photos, or else it was to prevent possible damage to paintings and textiles by repeated flashes of light. Well, we missed seeing a Gift Shop -- if there was one -- and now you don't NEED to use flash to get good pictures. So, all we can figure is that continuing to forbid photography is a device to increase the speed at which you could hustle people through the place. If they can't stop to snap a pic, it'll be easier to keep them moving.If you are trying to decide whether to include Dolmabache in your itinerary, weigh it against something else you might want to do. Do you really need to see yet another display of ostentatious wealth -- that nearly bankrupted the country! -- or would you rather stroll through a charming waterside town like nearby Ortakoy or take a memorable day cruise on the Bosporus? (Also, be sure to inquire about handicapped access, if you need it. I did not see an elevator, only a monumental stairway, to get to the upper floor of the Palace.) We have traveled extensively all over the planet, and maybe we just need to stop visiting the palace venues, but to us, Dolmabache Palace was \"just another palace.\" That is not to say it isn't worth a visit. It truly is extraordinary. The design, construction and quality of materials is top-notch throughout and the gardens are impeccably maintained. The workmanship displayed in all the furnishings is superb. The setting, right on the Bosporus, is one of the most dramatic of any palace we have seen. The whole place must have impressed the Europeans, which was the intent behind its construction. If you haven't already visited a number of palaces, you might find Dolmabache exciting and beautiful. It is. But what I remember most about it is not the gilded decor, the wonderful waterside setting, the 2-ton chandeliers or the Crystal Staircase. I remember the frustration of being rushed through it."

The palace is right by the sea, and if you took that trip on the Bosphorus already, then you know how big and attractive this palace is. It's certainly very adorned and opulent, it is meant to impress. And the oppulance starts from the entrance. You will most certainly like it, so take half a day to go there. It is a very popular TA and the tickets are fairly expensive. For the whole thing, official rooms plus harem, you pay about 60 TL. It's way cheaper if you have ISIC card. The official rooms are really somptuous, while the harem rooms are much simpler. You get a glimpse into the everyday life though, but if you want to save up money, just go to the official rooms and don't worry about missing anything out at the harem wing. Queues get rather long, b/c there's a tour every 20 - 30 minutes (one in Turkish, one in English) and you need to wait if you missed the previous tour. So be prepared to stand on your feet a lot or simply look for the plate that announces the tour hours: they're very rigurous about it.

This is a stunning example of extravagant opulence which most tourist miss. It is the best palace I have seen. The exterior and interior features are so ornate and the locals take exceptional steps to maintain this wonder. You cannot take photos( not supposed to), you have to wear covers on your shoes and tour the palace with one of their tours. Very controlled but you will see why. The chandeliers are out of this world and the ultimate chandelier a gift from Queen Victoria is just breathtaking. You must see that chandelier and the room to believe the epitome of opulence. The views from the palace which overlooks the Bosphorous are amazing. Note almost all of the clocks are stopped at 9:05 which is the time General Ataturk died in the palace. He is the founder of the Turkish Republic and beloved. Ataturk means father or Turks."

The queuing was annoying, especially in 30 degree heat. No individual visits are allowed so you have to queue in the sun until they are ready to start the tour. The advantage is that there is no extra cost for an audio guide and the guides are quite informative. Also it is not included on the museum pass. However I would thoroughly recommend a visit here, especially if you are interested in 19th century architecture."

We have a complaint about the guided tour because the group was way too large and the tour guide was nearly impossible to understand. It took us several minutes to realize that he actually spoke English. I have no idea what he was saying. The entry fee cost more than the Topkapi Palace and the Hagia Sophia but the tour was unfortunately pretty much useless. We did love the splendor of the halls and salons though. It was heartbreaking to see a lot of trash in the gardens. I actually picked up several plastic water bottles because I couldn't bare the sight of them thrown between all the lovely flowers."

I have seen most of the world's best palaces but it is right there competing for first place with the Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg. If you have time in Istanbul put Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace on your must-do list.As other reviewers have noted, get there early and even then, be prepared to stand in line. The day we went was Saturday and the daily quota of visitors was exhausted by lunch time. First, there is a line for security checkpoint, and then, a line to purchase tickets. After you enter the grounds, there is a line at the door to the palace waiting to join a tour. If you are reading this, you will want the English tour. The other choice is Turkish. Make sure you know which line you are in. Photos are NOT allowed in the building."

The palace itself is very beautiful and if you have a bit of extra time in Istanbul there are certainly worse places to spend some time but I'm really not a fan of the 'guided' only visit that you must do to get in.Whilst I'm not against using a guide in certain situations, this format really didn't work at Dolmabahce. There must have been around 40-50 people in our group with a wait of around 25 minutes to get in. This meant that as we were at the back, it was very difficult to hear the guide in most of the rooms/corridors which can be quite narrow. We basically missed all the commentary and because there were so many people in our group there was no opportunity to actually spend some time studying the rooms or decor. There were a number of rooms we either walked past and could look in for 5 seconds or just walked straight by that I would have liked some time to actually enjoy. Even the largest and most spectacular rooms were moved through very quickly.The palace was impressive I just felt we really got moved in and out as quickly as possible and after paying 40 TL for the palace and Harem, to emerge after just over an hour having done both these tours was a little disappointing when I feel left to my own devices I could have spent double that time and actually felt like I got to experience the building."

And after an hour-and-a-half wait to get into this palace on a Sunday morning (you're strongly advised to queue from 8am as the crowds are heaving by 9am), I would have expected nothing less than 'wow'! This palace is incredible. You are only allowed to go inside with a tour-guide as they take you around and explain everything from the crystal staircase to the palace's bathrooms. What you get for your money (or if you're lucky to get in for free like I was as I happened to go on the weekend of a public holiday) is a 45 minute tour of the reason why Turkey was almost bankrupted by this marvel and you can certainly see why.Room by room, the place itself is so incredibly adorned that you almost excuse the tour guide for being barely audible and seeming like he hasn't a clue what the scripted English he is spouting means. The tour is finished with a bang as you are led into the grandest room of them all - cue a chorus of gasps from all. Outside the palace is just as incredible. What a view. The immaculate gardens and the Istanbul skyline over the glimmering Bosphorus hit you in the face - this is prime location Turkish real-estate! Now, what's the price tag?"

When we were planning how to spend our days in Istanbul - what to see what not to see we were very confused about Dolmabache palace - is it worth seeing or not..however we are glad that we did end up going there finally.Its the Palace that was built by the Ottoman rulers as their modern palace and as part of the reform to fit into the changing modern times.It is a very beautiful palace.As per the earlier reviews I had read we were aware of the long lines for tickets etc so we made sure we left our hotel early around 8.15am. We took a tram and got off at the kabatas station and from there it was a 5 minutes walk.The first line was for the security check and then the next one was for the ticket.To be frank if you get in the early the lines are not so bad and they move fast.Just ensure that you don't go to late as they have a limit on the number of visitors they allow in a day to avoid over crowding as the palace had wooden flooring and cant take too many visitors as told to us by our guide.Next there are again 3 lines at the entrance to the palace once you cross the gardens..one for Turkish visitors,the other for Groups with guides and finally one for English. These lines are there because they do not allow one to wander about in the palace you need to be part of a guided tour.So we had a great guide inside who took us around.I think she was very good given the situation.For convenience and security purpose they the guide needs to take about 30-35 people in one group.However our guide explained everything as well as she could with such a large group.One got to see some lovely Turkish carpets, European chandeliers , furniture etc. espl don't miss out the lovely art work on the domes and ceilings. Of course the palace also had a lovely view of the Bosphorous. Finally when the first part of the tour is over you can carry on if you have tickets for the next part which is the harem part.It has the personal rooms of the sultans and all the women in the harem.Again the same process is followed one gets a guide as per the language and they take you around.Not much to learn in that part of the palace but still was nice to see the way the rooms were.All in all a beautiful place.In total we were done in 2-2.5 hours.So if you like opulent palaces this is the place to see.The ticket prices were for the official part 30 TL and for the harem 20 TL and if you buy common ticket for both parts then 40 TL."

All the clocks in the palace have been stopped at 9:05, which was the time (AM) Ataturk passed away. We visited the palace with a tour group so we didn't wait in line for tickets. There was a slight wait at the entrance of the palace, to let the other groups out. Be sure to spend some time in the gardens. Both the front gardens and the back ones facing the Bosphorus were beautiful. There are many palaces in Istanbul, but in my opinion, Topkapi and Dolmabahce are the two worth visiting for their historical significance and architectural differences."

At the entrance, the first bad surprise: a total of around 2 hour of waiting: for security control, to buy a ticket (museum pass is not accepted) and for an available English speaking guide.The worst part was the line for tickets: there was only one person selling tickets. In fact, there were two ticket offices opened, but one was reserved for groups. However, not many groups showed up. Thus, the employee just waited, patiently for the groups and spent most of her time reading or talking instead of selling individual tickets! It was almost disrespectful with everyone that was waiting!Very little information is available during the visit and objects are shown randomly. You are obliged to pay attention to the guide, otherwise you'll miss it.Poor structure, lots of control.

The palace is considered well preserved with most construction still in their original state. For me the most breathtaking is the stairways with the baccarat crystal hanging down, when you look up it was just wow and the detailings surrounding the stairways, baccarat crystal and mahogany wood, were just extravagantly beautiful. Some of the rooms are really beautiful and the detailing added the extra oomph to it. Anyway it was awesome and not regretting going there at all just to see the crystals and its treasure."

The building is neat and fun to see where the sultan moved after Topkapi palace: different as night and day. It was moving to see where Ataturk died. Because of the crowds it is easy to run into annoying people who try to take pictures when it is forbidden, people who touch things when it is forbidden and people who do not stay on the carpet so they damage the floors.

The palace can be visited only on guided tours (which is understandable because of all this precious goods, decorations) , the guides rush people through the rooms, you don't have time to see and enjoy everything, their english is not very good and they are extremely careful that the visitors don't take pictures, which is understandable as they want you to buy pictures from the museum shop, but they run out of DVD's in the shop!"

The entrance fee is a little pricey, but get the ticket that includes a guided tour of the harem as well. The beautiful crystal balustrade of the main staircase, is worth the price of admission! The tours are a little too fast, but it permits more people to see the palace. The view of the strait of Bosporus is beautiful, as are the gardens. There is a nice cafe with outdoor tables.

Take the tram to the Kabatas terminus and then a 5-minute walk beyond. Tours to both the Palace and the Harem are by guide only with no photography allowed - the Harem is extra. Both are conducted at break-neck speed (50 mins Palace; 25 mins Harem). We had to wait about 20 minutes for a tour of the Palace, less for the Harem (mid April). The English guided tours depends very much on who gives it: some guides have very accented broken English, others are much better with a wry sense of humour. The palace itself is a glitzy mix of east meets west - Turkey meets an over-the-top, money-is-no-object, European excess (an OTT Versailles) where nothing is done by halves: there is a 4-tonne chandelier; a Crystal Staircase (actually only the balusters are crystal); massive reception rooms. There is certainly a \"wow\" factor with a number of rooms. It is probably expensive for what it is and the grounds are a bit disappointing, except for waterfront views over the Bosphorus, but do include an aviary and peacocks. There is a cafe inside the complex near the entrance to the Harem (drinks & cakes only), but a better cafe in the outer gardens (outside the turnstiles, near the clock tower) which is very reasonable and much recommended (drinks, light meals, etc). Walk back to Kabatas and take the underground funicular up to Taksim Square."

We arrived at 11 am, and we agreed leaving at 13:45, because we had to check out at 14:00.Once we arrived, the view was amazing, with a huge clock tower to our right and the magnificent entrance of the palace in the front. Standing in queue 1 wasn't too long, about 10 minutes, where our bags were scanned. But standing in queue 2 was a nightmare: we've waited for 40 minutes to get our tickets. I mean how can ONE person in the counter provide services to almost 500 visitors? The ticket price is expensive, I am pretty sure they can afford three counters!We went inside the high walls of the palace. There were a splendid garden with amazing tulips, an incredible fountain, trees, lovely cats, ... We walked around 50 meters through the front stairs of the palace: A THIRD ENDLESS QUEUE WAS WAITING FOR US! We waited like 20 minutes, and our turn never came. The organizer shouted: WE'RE TAKING 20 PERSONS EACH 10 MINUTES! Seriously dude? We're like 500 persons!It was already 13:15 so we left, without visiting the palace interior. Going there needs two steps:A) Book the tickets a day earlier, so you don't have to waste your time in the second queue! (the Palace closes on Mondays and Thursdays).B) Considering at least 3 hours to visit Dolmabahce Palace.The architecture of the palace is amazing, it combines the baroque and the rococo and gives a new identity for the whole building. The charm of the composition from the outside makes you go back in time and realize how professional were the executed details in old buildings.Istanbul isn't far from Beirut: I am going there back again, I will definitely visit the palace and be seduced with its \"gold\" interior charm."

Now, that said, the palace was quite lovely and we had an English tour guide who did give us some nice background into the palace (you are required to go through with a tour guide in the palace, hence the wait).

            "review": "Impressive palace, poor organisation of visits. The Dolmabahce Palace is a large and impressive building in a beautiful position. It is hard to describe it as being tasteful, but this is totally over-the-top Ottoman bling. It looks a bit like the sultan asked Ali G to do the interior decor. The state apartments have the famous crystal staircase and one of the world's largest chandeliers -impressive even if kept switched off. The harem apartments contain the rooms used by Ataturk for the last four years of his life, and so are iconic for the Turkish people. That is the good part.A place with so much going for it has been organised in such a way that I repeatedly apologised to my wife for suggesting that we go there. There are certainly enough members of officialdom to do the organising. An army of besuited ones, very dapper and looking terribly self-important are forever walking past the endless lines of plebs whose only claim to have a quick look is their payment of the rather high ticket price. The only reason that I disagree with the reviewer who said to go in low season is that we did and the queues were still ridiculous.We joined the first queue - for security - great, only ten minutes. Then we got through and saw the ticket queue - 45 minutes later we were privileged to part with our money. Still, we had queued for less than an hour in total. Then we saw the enormous queue for the state apartments, so we went to the harem apartments and joined the queue there. After another 45 minutes we were allowed to join the 30 minute tour. We then decided we had better get in line for the state apartments if we were to see them before the palace closed - after all we had only arrived at noon for something that should be a couple of hours! The queue took another one and a quarter hours, then we joined the 45 minute tour. Add walking time and the same again to take pictures in the grounds and our one and a half hour experience took up five hours.Even after an hour in the last queue, my wife said \"shall we just give up and go?\" Perhaps our mistake was not to do that earlier.As there is no shelter from the sun whilst queuing, I would not suggest doing this in the summer!Tip - use the toilet before joining each queue.Add our hour wasted hours to those of all the other people stuck in the preposterous queues, and just think what could be achieved with that time! The organisation is meticulous once you realise that it is for the convenience of the officials running the palace. It simply wastes huge amounts of other people's time, time to which they seem to attach no value at all. This is not a good attitude towards people.The tours are in Turkish or English. The bigger demand that day was for English. However, those wanting Turkish had to wait in the same queues until splitting right at the end. An even bigger waste of time. Having said that, you might as well opt for whichever tour has the shortest queue. The main functions of the guides were to keep people from wandering by themselves and stop them taking pictures. The harem tour was more informative - we now know more about circumcision as a result. The state apartments tour less so - the crystal staircase was not even mentioned - \"This is an exhibition hall, it contains royal things\" was the only comment for the room signed \"\"Exhibition Room II\" (we never saw no. I) and had a display of posh stuff in a palace - we could have worked out that the object we were looking at was a big chandelier. But they did manage to stop people taking pictures.Somehow they did it so much better at Topkapi, and I cannot believe the visitor numbers are fewer.After our visit we took the funicular to Taksim Square and visited another palace - Simit Saray. OK, it's a cafe with saray=palace in the name. In contrast the queue was short at a busy time of day, we felt valued, the tea and cakes were really nice and we enjoyed it.This visit to the Dolmabahce Palace was the one thing we regretted doing during a whole week in Istanbul. Everything else was either very good or excellent. This could have been."

It was really interesting to tour, the grounds were lovely. But the long lines and chaos made it almost not worth it. I guess I am glad I saw it, but I can't say I would recommend it just because there are so many things to do and see in Istanbul that this takes up way too much time and is really frustrating and stressful.Pros: Interesting gardens with lovely grounds, they have an English tour of the palace - one for the rooms where the sultan's government and ambassador affairs took place (the Selamlik) and one for the living quarters of the royal family (the Harem). Cons: see below. Plus, it was built when the royal family was trying to be very European, so all the decor is over-the-top European paintings, Italian artists painting the ceilings, gifts from Gernmany, etc. Not characteristically Turkish like Topkapi Palace. What to know:1) Get there early - seriously. The lines are incredible. They only let 3000 people in daily and it sells out early. We stood in line for 50 minutes in the rain in the off season...just to buy tickets. You can buy a combo of both tours (Selamlik and the Harem) or pick one. 2) Once you are through the main gates, you can then wander the grounds and take photos3) In order to view the inside of the palace, you stand in line again for 45minutes or more to get in via a tour. The front entrance is the Selamlik tour and the way back entrance is for the Harem tour.4) You cannot tour the palace itself unless you are part of the tours - there is an English tour line and a Turkish tour line. They are included in the ticket price and are mandatory to see the palace. The English tour line took 45 minutes - 1 hour again on the off season. It was insane. You then are allowed to enter in groups of 30 or so and given a tour. The guides speak decent English, and kind of funnel you quickly through. Not a lot of time to look and cameras aren't allowed. 4) We finished the Selamlik tour (which is the one the guidebook said to prioritize as it has all the opulent entertaining rooms and chandeliers), and you exit the building and walk a few minutes to the Harem tour...and there was another 45min-1 hour long line to get into those tours. We tried to take the Turkish tour (way shorter line) because we only wanted to see the place, but the guard was uncharacteristically rude and let people in only if they spoke Turkish to him without explaining. So the lines are Turkish if you speak Turkish, English if you don't. End of story. We gave up. We were so sick of waiting in lines in order to pay to wait in more lines and then treated rudely and hurried through. I can definitely say not worth it unless you don't mind wasting an otherwise fun day in Istanbul. Avoid. Way better to take a Bosphorus boat tour and sail past the water facade and take photo because the facade is stunning!"

But we were so lucky, by the time we came out the queue was several hours long. This place is so worth it though, the ceiling paintings are stunning, the crystals drip off the masive chandeliers, stair cases are impressive, This place should be number 4 or 5 on your list of things to do in Istanbul.My suggestion, as with others in the past is skip the hotel breakfast and get to the Palace as it opens, or soon after 9am as you can. The hareem is very good, but after seeing the main palace, it's like having to take a Mercedes home after driving all day in a Rolls Royce. So just get the ticket for the main palace, unless you like queueing. The restaurant just outside the main gate just begs to have a coffee/tea and cake over looking the river and a good place to compare the photos you didn't take inside."

The \"security guards\" didn't care to check people properly but still made you wait. Then, in the inside area, we stood in line for another 30 min for the entrance fee. Now, as you would expect to finally be let in, you get to stand in line for another 10 min, until your guided group can enter the public area of Dolmabahce. The same happened after this first part of the tour, we had to wait in line for 10 min to enter the harem. So, I spent more time standing in line than visiting the palace.2. RIP-OFF: You learn the price of the tour only AFTER having spent half an hour with the standing in line for the nonsensical \"security check\". As a non-Turkish citizen, you pay the double amount, which is 40 TL per person (=18\u20ac) instead of 20 TL (=9\u20ac).3. POOR GUIDING: You can only visit in groups of ca. 120 people. So, effective guiding would be possible, even if the guides tried. The different groups are in constant rotation, which is really good for their sales and really bad for the air inside and for the space you have while being chased through like cattle (=none). You don't get to choose where to go, not even how fast or slow you want to go through. We had two guides, one of which was really arrogant and unfriendly and the other just visibly overburdened with trying to cope with a group of more than a hundred people with children and very different temperaments. 4. NO PHOTOS, NO CAMERAS: But the best of all was, that you were not allowed to take photos or take videos. The sights are really remarkable and for the pains and expenses that you must take, you would at least have expected to be allowed photographing. Istanbul has plenty of other attractions, so don't waste your time with Dolmabahce Palace.

Only guided tours allowed, if you are not part of a tour group, then you get a guided group tour from the palace."

We had problems already buying the ticket since the credit card POS was not working (but it could happen). The major issue is that you are in big group and the tour guide is really difficult to understand or he does not wait that you are there in order to start with his explanation. Moreover due of the size of the group and due to the facts that some people does not speak/understand English, they will talk during the visit and you cannot follow the guide.Anyway it is really worth to pay a visit at this palace."

The sheer size and volume of the decor was truly amazing. The ceremony room at the end of the tour is definitely a great finish.

While that may be a turn off for some, the nice thing about it, at least for my group, we were able to get in right away without waiting.

My partner and I visited it in January on a bitterly cold day when it snowed. We saw it as a part of a whole day Bosphorus cruise and were awed by its splendour and beauty!The sad part was that we were part of a tour group and had only a limited time in the Palace. Apparently, one cannot visit the Palace unless as part of a tour group. If you are not attached to a tour group then you will be assigned to one under the watchful eye of a guide as well as security officers.We appreciated the security measures, which will surely help to preserve what is a treasure trove of priceless art and artifacts. That said, it was a tad irritating that we couldn't take our time admiring some of the artwork and had to scramble to keep up with the group. The artwork was simply magnificent! Paintings, sculptures, crystal, chandeliers.... the list is endless. No visit to this beautiful city would be complete without a visit to Dolmabahce Palace."

The interesting thing is not that it is the most glamorous building in the world, it is that the world and his neighbour has contributed to the furniture and fittings to give a cosmopolitan feel. French architecture is complemented by gifts from England, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, United States and China. All prove that Turkey is and always has been a strategic meeting point for the countries of the world."

The harem is not to be missed. Interesting to see where the women of the household used to live. Can't really imagine, as too many heads can create a mess. I particularly loved the original furnitures, the baths, porcellains,and the chandeliers that can be seen in the saloon. By the way, photography in the palace is prohibited. Nevertheless you'll be able to snap great photos outdoors. And do not miss taking photos with the 'royal' guards. You'll be able to see them marching in the area too."

The most interesting parts of the palace come at the end, so you have to be patient!!!

I agree with prior reviewers: we did not have to wait in line (went about 1:00pm on weekday), but we were herded through the palace in a big group. Guide was both inaudible unless you were very close to her, and she was unintelligible if you could hear her. Basically, she droned through a memorized script. Harem was slightly better in terms of the guide, but we were still rushed through it, with strict rules not to wander from the group and not to take photos.The palace itself is a monument to extravagance, wealth, privilege, and vulgarity. There is hardly a square inch of floor, ceiling, or wall space that is not adorned, in a fantastic mishmash of styles, designs, and colors. The only unifying theme is the abundant use of elaborate inlaid woods, prodigious applications of gold, miles of silk, and tons and tons of marble. There were long corridors of paintings, but we had no time to look at them. Baths were a feature and quite engaging.The cost for this sprint is 40 TL a person, making it one of the more costly sights in Istanbul. Depends on your budget, but whether you go inside or not, the exterior itself is worth a visit, sitting on the shore of the Bosphorus with a commanding view of the Asian side of the city. Might be fair to say the most attractive part of the tour is looking out and away from the palace at the other side of the river."

One majestic palace, that is... Claimed to be the biggest palace in Turkey, residing almost 15.000 m2, this relatively modern palace was constructed between 1843-56. Many Sultans had lived here.. Several choices of tour are available and I took the Selamlik tour, or the administrative part of the Palace. It lasts around 45 minutes and you have to wait till the designated time with a guide, no individual tour, et no photos inside. If you're coming with your own tour guide et group, you'll get a priority. In less than 1 hours, I saw a lot.The inside is really lovely, too bad we cant take pictures inside... some are amazing while the rest need to be maintained. The heavily Turkish accent guide took us around. We saw the secretariat's room, entrance hall, noble room, crystal staircase, wood panels, noble floor, ambassadorial, waiting room, sultan's reception room, crown prince room, sultan's apartment, with ebony, mahagony, and walnut wooden floor panels , and of course french baccarat fireplace.. We also see the study room, library, and remarkable turkish hamam with carved marbles, and lovely, lovely view of the Marmara sea...I would love to spend so much time here :D The best part is indeed the grand ceremony hall..with biggest chandeliers, weight around 4.5 tons, great carpet, huge pillars, and special balconies for jurnalists et musicians. Picture yourself dancing around the room...or maybe not dancing, just roaming around :D... Btw, most of the information given by the guide are printed in the brochures...so, make sure you have one copy... In one of the rooms we saw collections of big paintings, dining sets in gold et silver! Crystals and many gem-tinted objects.. Vases, draperies and some other valuables are presented, but the information on those displayed objects are not always available.All in all....The interior is amazing...the surrounding scenery is also lovely.. don't miss it..."

We visited the Dolmabahce Palace on a Sunday morning in February and despite arriving quite early it was already very busy.We waited a little while outside to be admitted to the entrance hall and then some more time inside until the English-speaking guide was ready to begin the next tour. You can't explore the palace yourself and the guided tour takes 45 minutes. Unfortunately, due to the size of the tour group, I found it very difficult to hear what the guide was saying so I just settled for looking at the opulent surroundings. The rooms are vast and elegant with beautiful chandeliers, mirrors and furnishings. It's a massive collection of buildings, so allow plenty of time to explore the whole site. The Harem visit involves a separate guided tour which takes 25 minutes more and then there are the picturesque grounds with a large aviary and great views along the Bosphorus.There is a cafe on site but we chose to exit the grounds and go to a smart cafe/restaurant just outside, close to the clock tower, with a view of all the river traffic. The locals were enjoying traditional breakfasts of hard boiled eggs, olives, salad and delicious bread and it seemed to be something of a family social event.The admission fee is higher than some of the other tourist attractions in the area (40 Turkish lira for the palace and Harem) but you could spend the whole day exploring the site at your leisure.My only criticism is that the palace could do with some love and improvement - the carpets are getting threadbare and the silverware in the cabinets needs to be polished - it was almost black. A young boy in our tour group touched one of the window blinds and it actually fell off because it was in such bad condition."

I thought I could just walk around by myself and so bought both the palace and harem tickets. I didn't get in to see the harem because the palace tour took too long. Honestly, I don't think the guided tour is very good, either. They didn't say anything that couldn't have been put on signs in the rooms. The tour talked generally about the use of the rooms and some of the furniture in the rooms. Nothing that you need a guide for."

I didn't have to wait in a line to tour the Dolmabahce and it was comfortable inside. That being said, this was probably my favorite tourist site during my visit to Istanbul. It was absolutely mind blowing how intricate all of the wood work, masonry, and crystal work was throughout the palace. If I had to dream up a palace of my own, a lot of the features of the Dolmabahce would be present. You can't walk through the tour without pondering the enormous wealth the sultans must have had to build such a palace. Everything is covered in gold, marble, crystal, and pearl. Even little things like exotic woods embedded in the doors. If you plan on visiting any other palaces while in Istanbul, save this for last, because we went to see the Beylerbeyi Palace later in the day and it completely pales in comparison to the Dolmabahce."

We were there during the winter and it was REALLY COLD and yet we did have a tea outside!

Entry to palace. You are taken through in a large (read very large) group and you follow a 'maze' through the palace stopping at various points to hear (in our case) a very unimaginative rote speech from a guide who lacked passion or interest. We had an English language tour which worked for us but not sure if everyone in our large group understood English. What should have been an amazingly interesting and rich experience turned into an ordeal and I was glad when the 'tour' finished. Whilst acknowledging the complexities involved in getting large numbers of people through a historic building as well as accommodating visitors from around the world who speak many different languages, I do think that the organisers need to rethink how they present and interpret this major historical site. Having said this it is still worth visiting just get their early I.e. 0900."

Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace is an amazing piece of work, displaying the grandeur at the end The Ottoman Empire, mid 1800's. But and a very big BUT, plan to visit at opening time unless you're prepared to waste hours of your holiday, standing in line. We arrived at noon on January 2 and endured a 1 hour wait to pay for admission, followed by another painful hourlong wait to gain access to the palace and tour. You cannot walk through the palace at will, the tour, lasting about 40 minutes, is compulsory to control access. Given it's historical importance and popularity, the administration is woefully incompetent in it's site management. At other popular attractions around the world, a simple timed admission policy allows for a coherent manner of crowd control; not the case here. The groups of 50 or so, eventually merge into a single mass with the guides trying to talk over each other in the same rooms. Close to mayhem. Waiting to gain entry, we were fortunate the weather was beautiful for January, about 12 degrees C and sunny. Had it been the middle of summer with temperatures in the 30s (90s F) it would be unbearable, considering there is no shade by the palace entrance.Once again, Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace is a jaw dropping example of opulence; unfortunately I would only recommend worth a visit if you're able to go at opening, before the crowds. The administrators should be ashamed at treating their visitors in such manner and need to hire competent professionals who are able put into place, an admission policy which works. The current system is a total failure.I'm rating it 1 star due to horrible wait times and a total disaster in delivering a suitable visitor experience for a very high cost but the Palace is a 5 star destination. You have been warned!"

Built after Topkapi Palace, this grand palace housed the Sultan and his clan in a more modern European influenced structure. Topkapi with it's dilapidated smallish rooms and uneven concrete walkways and hallways, contrast sharply with this modernist re-creation of the living quarters and domain of the Sultans of the Turkish empire.  Complete with giant chandeliers and 4 to 5 meter tall doors leading to spacious rooms, this huge structure sits along the Bosphorus sea. Admission includes a guided tour in English and takes about an hour. The harem guided tour also, takes about an hour and both can be purchased at the same time. Between tours, visit the small cafe and have some Turkish tea. (You might even see the peacock walking around) The elegance and shear size of the palace, along with it's informative tour is worth the slightly overpriced entrance fee. To get the full historical significance, it seems visiting both palaces is essential.  It is a short walk from Kabatas ferry terminal via either the funicular from Taksim or tram from Galata. After, spending the morning at the palace and grounds, you can get on the ferry and head to the Asian side of the Bosphorus. The ferry gives you great views without having to take the Bosphorus cruise."

The guide would get to a particular point and start speaking although most of the people had not yet reached him because they were still looking at a previous room or unable to move quickly because of the narrow corridors. This was a problem throughout the tour of the harem. When asked to wait until all the visitors had reached him, he said that he was not to blame.

You can tour just the main palace for 25TL and for many people that might be the better option because this area is by far and away the most spectacular. The Palace was built in 1856 and housed the last Sultans as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. Later Ataturk, the father of the Turkish Republic worked, lived and died there. The Palace is nothing short of spectacular. Be aware however that you must go on a guided tour there which is rather annoying because they tend to be rather large - around 50 people, so it's difficult to hear and you are rushed through. Also you need to wear overshoes to enter."

The drag is that you can't see the interiors on your own, so you are on a tour which to me moved at a faster pace then I would have liked. While the tour gave you some information it was hard to get an opportunity to take your time to see everything. Also the tour seemed to have too many people so you either had to stay close to the tour guide and rush or take your time and see things but miss what the tour guide was saying."

            "review": "worth a visit, but prepare for queues. They only allow no more than 3000 visitors a day, so you'd better come before the noon to be there. Traveling from Sultanahmet area, it's easy to take tram and get off on the last stop. The palace will be ahead of you, in a short walking distance. Taxi from Sultanahmet will cost no more than 30 TL, from Taxim/Pera - no more than 20 TL (never use non-metered taxi!).The palace itself is grandeur, really worth a visit, but personally I find their \"only guided tours\" policy very inconvenient and annoying. You always have to queue up and wait for the guide who takes groups of 50-60 people at one time, so you can't hear him most of the time. I can't understand why they don't allow self-visitors since there are care-takers everywhere inside the palace, so you won't break or mishandle anything. Despite the most reviewers, I would skip the harem part. it's mostly the same women apartments along the corridor, so there's not much to see. Could be more interesting if accompanied by a private guide who can explain you everything and tell some stories about the harem's everyday life in sultan times. If you go with a group tour - give it a miss."

You can only visit this palace in groups, either organised groups, or individuals queing up for either a tour in English or Turkish, so you may have to wait 20-30 mins to get in. There are 2 tours, the Palace and the Harem. Aspects of the tour are boring in terms of the commentary, though each room has its own interest. And if you like your chandilers big, be prepared to be wowed when you see a 4.5 ton one. No pictures are allowed inside the place, so reckon on getting a book before or after. It is another sight where you have to put plastic protectors on your shoes.See Ataturk's bed complete with a Turkish flag silk duvet cover."

Nevertheless all entries are conducted by a guide either English or Turkish so we waited 15 mins for the English tour to begin. Our shoes had to be covered by protective covering (provided) before entering. Oh it was so worth it - it's mind blowing. The shear opulence of the crystal chandeliers (bacarrah and English crystal) was astonishing as we're the beautiful carpets and ornate furniture. I found it an emotional experience and worth the 50 minute tour. Would have excluded the harem which was an optional cost as it was an anti-climax after the main palace. Beware of taking a taxi from outside the palace to return to the Sultanahmet area as we were totally ripped off being charged over double the price."

            "review": "Over-rated and over-priced. The Dolmabahce Palace was built between 1843 and 1856 and the last six sultans of the Ottoman Empire lived in this palace. It is also the place where Mustafa Kemal Attaturk died at 9:05 AM on 10 November 1938. Attaturk used the Dolmabahce Palace as a residence when he was in Istanbul although he lived in Ankara. Since his death, no one has lived in the palace; it was turned into a museum. There are no individual tours to the palace. There are two sections that can be visited: the Selamlik (or ceremonial) portion of the palace and/or the Harem-cariyeler (harem and concubines' quarters). The room where Attaturk died (which has been preserved exactly as it was at the time of his death) is included in the Harem-cariyeler tour. You can also buy a ticket called All Palace which includes both tours and is supposed to include the Crystal Pavilion and the Clock Museum. Unfortunately, when we visited in late November 2012, both of these areas were closed.This is one of the most expensive attractions in Istanbul and it is not worth the price. Apart from the beautiful chandeliers (primarily in the Selamlik area of the palace), and several beautifully painted ceilings and parquet floors, this palace is in sad need of a refurbishment. This is especially true for the harem portion of the tour. In spite of the high admission fee, no photographs are allowed in the palace and the guidebooks for sale are rather sad. A cheaper edition is really amateurish and the more expensive edition makes a very heavy addition to your suitcase. There are some postcards which show the highlights but even they need to be updated by a professional photographer. Our visit was really a disappointment."

As with the other reviewers, there is no chance that you can avoid looong queues. Queing is already 2 hours worth of your time. You queue to buy tickets, and you queue once more because they only allow small batch of people to go inside the palace with a walking guide.Tips:- If you are a group, you can split up and the others are eating at the nearby cafe and bring something to entertain.- If you are alone, this a good time to chat with the other people. I've seen more turkish families visiting this place as well.- They restrict the number of people that come in everyday. If you arrive in the afternoon, chances are you are not going to get in before it closes at 3PM.- There is suppose to be an e-reservation system online, but it is currently not working.

However, the process for seeing the palace left us frustrated. You queue to buy your tickets, then walk through to the gardens-which are lovely, with heat views onto the water. You then join another queue to get into the palace, we waited for 20 mins). You must go on a tour (of palace, and/or harem). The staff called forward all the Turkish speakers in the queue to enter, as that was the language of the first group. 10 mins later the one in English ran. We were lucky to get into our group-last folks through-otherwise we would have had to wait longer.Our group was large, perhaps bad luck. The fact that only Turkish, or English tours were offered, and you cannot go in unaccompanied was surprising. I felt sorry for the 90% of people in our groups that were not native English speakers, and some that obviously couldn't speak any English but were forced to trek round. There are no information boards, so if you are at the back of the group you probably won't hear well. The guide also needs to take you round quickly, so he was reduced to short pieces about the palace, which weren't very interesting-no anecdotes, just the bare facts. Not a criticism of him, more the process. He ended up speaking some Spanish to guests too.You cannot linger to look at anything, so have to move through with your group. We were totally fed-up and pressed for time, so decided not to go to the harem. We tried to get our money back- painful, exasperating and fruitless. The admissions desk manager was rude and disinteresting, citing the barcode on our ticket as the reason why a refund was impossible...it made little sense, but he stuck to it, whilst shrugging, and smoking. He sent us to the information point to deal with the issue, but phoned ahead to tell them to deny us anything. The woman there was helpful, and looked a little embarrassed by the whole thing. I didn't expect my money back, but by that stage I was frustrated - in for a penny, in for a pound! The only time we had a poor interaction in Istanbul."

Time&fee: It closed on Mon&Thu, Fee: 30TL-palace only entrance included tour guided, 40TL palace+harem tour guided, kids: free. No photo&tripod inside the building, but yes for the exterior building and garden. (We bought reasonable price postcard with interior pictures at the gift shop after the tour.) We bought the palace only entrance, but lucky to get a special tour that included both palace and harem since we visited at the kurban bayrami holiday. IMHO, Palace section is better than harem, but Ataturk room is in the harem section. 3. Review: We join a large group people for english tour and wear plastic cover for our shoes. I had read reviews that complain about the guide, but we got a charming lady who speak very good english and give interesting information. True, Its a quick tour, under 1 hour, but still really nice. Unlike other main attractions in Istanbul that lack of interior furniture, in this palace we saw original interior furniture that used by previous sultans and Ataturk. The crystal staircase, beautiful paintings, huge carpets, and chandelier at the last main hall are fantastic."

There's a mind boggling staircase made with balusters of Baccarat crystal and the Grand Ballroom has an English crystal chandelier that weighs four tons. The place is filled with beautiful carved furniture and paintings that recall the glory days of the Ottoman Empire. Kemal Attaturk spent his last days there and you can see where he lived and died. Dolmabahce Palace can be easily reached by taking the Old Town T1 tram to the end of the line at Kapatas and walking about 10 minutes along the coast. There are two tours, one of the main diplomatic area and one of the harem. The harem tour is a poor second to the diplomatic area tour, but I recommend buying a combination ticket (40 TL) and doing them both unless you are really pressed for time. Each tour runs approximately every half hour in English and Turkish. The combination tour ticket is also good for the excellent Palace Collection Museum which is a bit of a walk down the coast past the museum walls toward the Naval Museum. Even if it is a bit crowded I wouldn't miss the Dolmabahce Palace when visiting Istanbul."

You can take the tram T1 line get off at the last station which is Kabatas (pronounced Kabatash)...then walk like 5 minutes on the sea side to find first Dolambahce mosque, then clock tower and the entry to the palace. Last time to get tickets is 4 pm but they can close the kiosk earlier if the ran out of tickets as the palace has a qouta of 3000 visitors. There are some waiting time like 15 to 30 minutes at the door of the main hall enterance but the view of the garden makes it OK.The main architects were Armerinians...though you will find a heavy influance of French and British work with the furniture and ceilings. The Irish made crystal is a main theme in most rooms and halls, the main chandelier weights around 4.5 tones!!I was told that a third of the Ottman empire treasures were spent to build this palace that took 14 years to bring up.The Harem, our the main royal family quarter of the palace is very interesting section and it revokes the mental image that Harem was used to host concubines and a place for more \"bodily joys\".The only down side of the whole exprience is that video and photography is prohibited inside the palace.I will not go in details describing the rooms but will leave that as a surprise to feast your eyes.When done, you can enjoy a soothing drink or a meal by Basphourus in one of the couple of Cafeterias attached to the palace. The price for a tomato souo, Kefte plate (turckish meatball) and a Coca Cola was 18 tl.BY the way a USD is around 1.75 tl (turkish lira), rate varies from one exchange office to another so be careful.Taxies some times would rip you off by going through longer roads. The meter starts at 2.7 tl, so pls be alert. You are better off buying \"Istanbul Cart\" which goes for 7 tl for the card only and then you add credit. It works for all city transportations...mostly a ride would cost 1.95 tl for your planning.The tour guide was so professional and friendly. I believe her name was \"Hande\", she leads the English language tour. She has ample information on all details related to the palace and she kindly gave us some of her time after the tour to answer our questions.I wish I had her full name or contact to sebd her a thank you letter.

There are two lines for the palace, one for group tours (people who come in buses, etc) and one for individuals. Everyone in the Tour Group line enters first so if you wait quite a while and finally think you are going in, hope that a tour bus does not pull up. No shade to wait in so bring a hat or an umbrella. Tours are in multiple languages but you have no choice in the language. I ended up in an English tour but the guide had at least 50 people and was trying to explain things in multiple languages. Unless you were in the first 5-10 people, you will not be able to hear the guide and there seemed to be quite a bit of pushing to try to get to the front of the tour. One of the people in the group started yelling at the guide since she was upset that there was no description for most of the group but that didn't change anything. We pretty much marched through the palace with no time to stop and admire the decor. There was a second line to get into the Harem so more waiting.

Regardless of who lived there, this place is amazingly lavish offering breathtaking decors, design, accessories and beautiful views. We had to pre-book a tour to visit the palace. It is worth the visit, and a must see if you have enough time in Istanbul."

We stayed in Istanbul for a week and 'did' 2 sights a day. The most expensive was Topkapi at 25 Lira each. Dolmabahce palace was 30 Lira for the state apartments and 40 Lira for the Harem. We went in to the state apartments. It's only by guided tour and you get marched round in 45 minutes and you get told virtually nothing about what you're seeing. Total waste of time and money - we were so shocked and surprised compared to everything else we did in Istanbul. They were also amazingly precious about their carpets - everyone has to wear protective shoe covers before you even enter the front door!"

The place is nice, it is an European style palace where you can see how the sultans liked to show off their richness in some kind of a thacky way, very barroque and rococco like. The gardens are nice, so is the view of the Bosphorus.The down side of it is that you are obligated to visit it in a tour group. They make you almost run through the palace, the group is about 30 people and if you dont stand near the guide you cant hear what they say. Thay give a very fast explanaition (not very informative) and then rush into some other place. If you walk slower you miss the explanations and the guide of the next tour will catch you and ask you to walk faster.I definitely wouldnt reccomend it, at least as long as they keep obbligating visitors to make this fast visit. And it is kind of expensive (arround 30 TL without the Harem/ 40 TL with the Harem).There are plenty of other very interesting and nice places in Istanbul to visit.Not worth the time and the money."

For that, we got rushed through large reception rooms and peeked into small bedrooms in the harem. Dust is everywhere. The tour guide provided almost no explanations of anything and since there are tours before and after you every five minutes, there are no opportunities to linger or ask questions. You have to pay cash, but there is an ATM near the ticket booth. Total waste of time and money."

I read the reviews about the waiting time and poor guides so decided to take one of the many day trips which included a boat trip up the Bosphorus and a visit to the Dolmabahce Palace. We had our own guide so we were ushered through quite quickly and she gave an excellent overview of the history of the palace. Sure it would be nice to have your own private guide just to yourself, but that is not economical. I missed some of the commentary but this allowed me to inspect some of the artifacts at close quarters. As you cannot take photos inside the palace, why not buy one of the books that gives a complete history of the palace, complete with colour photos, either before or after your visit? A bit of planning can take away a lot of the frustration some people feel. The gardens are a wonderful place to sit and relax and watch the ships go by."

The decor in each of the rooms, the chandeliers, the architecture - everything is exquisite.I'm sure there are very valid reasons why you can only go with a tour organised by the palace, but given that this is the case, they really need to make more of an effort to make the tours enjoyable. There were about 40 people in my group, which is far too many for any tour. Our guide clearly hated her job and was bored by it. She gave minimal information and rushed us through. I was one of the last in the group because God forbid, I stopped to look at everything we were being shown (I was in no way being slow though!). But the result was that I missed most of her guidance because she started talking as soon as there were about five people in front of her instead of waiting for the whole group. The tour was supposed to be 40 minutes long, and it took just 25. I learned absolutely nothing about the palace or its history, which is a real shame.I feel they need more frequent tours and much better guides to make this a truly great experience - which it absolutely could and should be."

The palace is HUGE and has over 200 rooms, each immaculately decorated. The tour ends in one room (i won't give it away) which made my jaw drop. I always thought that was something that only happened in bad movies! This was perhaps my most favourite place in Istanbul to visit and worth all of the waiting around. IF you go, make sure you do the full tour and not just the harem as the administrative rooms are the best bit. Ottoman imperialism at its finest."

After a short walk from Kabatas station, I arrived at 8:30am and was 4th in line. After you buy your ticket, you walk to the palace entrance and wait in either the Turkish or English tour line. Tour groups seem to have a big advantage here. They seemed to have been able to reserve their times; so they went in before any of the individual travellers. The first English tour was pushed back to 9:30am, because we had to follow a half-dozen tour groups. You wear pink plastic covers over your shoes to protect the fine carpets.Because of its weak supporting structure, the palace can only hold 700 people at one time - so all visits are timed and visitors are hurried along. I had tried to visit the day before at 3:30pm but gave up when I saw the huge lines. If you decide to tour this palace, it must be the first thing on your agenda that day, unless you have some kind of reservation with a tour group.Our tour guide spoke good, but not perfect, English. We were a group of 50 or so tourists. I'm sure half the people had trouble hearing her. She mostly sourced the materials in each room. We only spent 2-3 minutes in each room. We walked through at least half the rooms without stopping on our way to the highlights. There is no time to appreciate the smaller details.As palaces go, this one is only average, well behind Versailles or Palacio Real in Madrid. There are 2 or 3 spectacular rooms and 2 incredible chandeliers. But there are also imitation marble columns made of stucco. This was truly an attempt for the 19th-century sultans to impress their Western European counterparts.Everyone says to skip the harem, which I did. The Topkapi Palace harem is far more historic. The gardens are small but beautiful. There is a nice cafe by the water, and next door you have the Naval Museum. You can take nice shots of the whole palace from the Bosphorus Cruise.If you only have 3 days in Istanbul, skip this entirely, especially since it's far away from the other sights and you can't take any photos inside. It's a Day 4 or Day5 activity at best. I believe it was 25TL for the main palace, an extra 15TL for the harem. Not a good rainy-day activity, because if you are stuck in the line-up, there is no cover."

The gardens and surrounds are very nice.It is a short walk from the terminal station of the blue line metro."

Being forced to move along with a group was quite constraining aside from the fact that no photography was allowed during the tour.

To enter you must wait in line to get tickets which are 30TL, it is cheaper if you are a student but they only accept ISIC cards. after this take a stroll around teh gardens up to the palace where you will have to wait for a tour in either English or Turkish. There is no schedule anywhere so you might be waiting anywhere from 5-45 minutes. The tour is brief and insightful and you get to visit many of the rooms of the palace allowing you to imagine what life was like for the Turkish rulers. Definitely not a 'must see' but if you have time it certainly is beautiful."

There are a couple of cafes in the place and you can get turkish coffee and cake. I did see a lot of cats in the area which was rather odd. I guess the tourists must feed them. The same tram that goes to Sultanahmet continues on to the palace (it's the last stop)."

If you visit both- the price is EUR 40. However, we went only to the palace, so I am not completely aware of how the Harem looks like. In the price of the ticket, a guided tour is included, where one nice young lady explained to us the history of the castle. It is really amazing! Everything is made of crystals and gold. It is just beautiful. The best things about it, is that everything in the palace (except of one throne) is original.

It is expensive to enter and inside no bags are allowed. If you don't take your water with you from the baggage disposal and it's hot, prepare to pay double the price for something to drink. Tourists cannot enter the buildings on their own and have to follow a guide. Our guides rushed through every hall and room, did not speak English very well did not give us much time to see anything. Because there are not so many guides as there are tourist, you have to wait some more at the entrance of every building. In total, I think we spent more time waiting inside and outside of the palace than actually seeing the palace.If you want to go, go early in the morning (when they open), so you can avoid the lines.

We hopped off the city sightseeing bus very near here, but it is very accessible from the last stop on the Tram at Kabatas. It is the 19th century palace built for the Sultan and the royal family and court when they decided to move out of Topkapi. It sits on the shore of the Bosphorus like a grand European palace with interiors to match. Entry is costed according to what you want to see. So 40 TL gets entry to both the formal part of the palace and also the family quarters, or Harem in separate tours that are supposedly guided so you cannot wander around alone. But the \"tours\" are large groups with either an English commentary by the guide or a Turkish tour. In fact, the guide gives his or her spiel at a very few set points and then walks on ahead to allow the mob of about 40 to wander behind peering into rooms. At the entrances there were no leaflets in any language. More or less each room has a board to say what it was. No photography allowed inside. The decor and interiors are in places mind-boggling. No expense was spared. I lost count of the number and variety of crystal chandeliers and huge floor-standing candelabras. The largest in the palace and in the whole of Europe weighs over 4tons and was a gift from Queen Victoria of the UK and it hangs from the high dome of the grand Muayede Lounge (a misnomer if ever there was one) with its gold throne. The main grand double staircase has crystal balusters. And so it goes on. The tour may not be as the UK's National Trusts or great country houses would do do it, but I would not miss this treat.The grounds and gardens that open out to the Bosphorus are beautiful. The views are awe inspiring. Watch the timing if you want to see it all. I believe that 3.30 pm is the cut-off for buying a ticket to both areas. The whole place seems to close at 4.45 so again watch your timing to allow yourself time to enjoy the grounds and gardens and Bosphorus views."

I wasn't very impressed with the interiors, beddings, linen, etc. maybe due to my exposure to Mughal opulence and the grandeur of Indian palaces. There is a guided tour that takes you through the main palace (which is the official wing of the palace) and the Harem (which is the residential wing of the palace for the Sultan, his wives and concubines). The palace has one of the largest crystal chandeliers in the world. And has a horse shoe shaped stairway that is called cyrstal staircase. The exteriors, the lawns, etc. are beautiful. Spend your time here. I enjoyed this more than the palace itself. Maybe the scorching sun and the long queues, the long waits for the tour to begin (once to see the main palace and the 2nd to see the Harem section), put a downer on my entire experience. But I personally believe there are better places to enjoy in Istanbul than the Dolmabachce Palace. Visit this after you have done everything else in Istanbul."

They only admit about 2000 visitors daily (as of now). after 10 am, ticket line can be longer. The place can be visited in 2.5 hrs with a guide. You are not allowed to wander on your own. A combined tour of he palace & harem costs 40 Turkish Lira= 20 Euros (approximately). (Btw, you can forget about the cafe near the entrance of the palace if you want to grab a bite. The service was very poor. Nice views by the water, but horrible food choices & forgettable service!)"

The first time around I was too ill to enjoy it properly but remember getting right in. The second time around was worse than the first time. I went early July 2012 in the morning and we waited 2 hours to buy tickets. They had 1 window open selling tickets and at some point when we got to the front of the line they closed the window for some reason. Note they also have different prices based on where you are from, Turkey or somewhere else. If you are from somewhere else you will pay more. We waited another hour to get into the actual palace. You have to wait for a guided tour and can't see it for yourself. THe tours are not very good. You can't hear the guides and they don't tell you much of everything. The groups are overly crowded as well, as they only offer English and Turkish tours you have all the other languages left to wonder what is going on. THe Harem costs extra but that was honestly the best part of the tour. During that tour is where you see Ataturk's room, and that is worth the price IMO. I suggest reading about the place before you go because you won't learn much about the place, especially the artwork. Overall what was only supposed to take us a couple of hours took nearly the whole day. It's not worth it. It's beautiful yes, but I suggest going off season so you can enjoy the place without wasting your whole day waiting. If you absolutely must see it, reserve at least the whole day for this during the tourist season."

The outside presents a strange (to me) air of faded elegance (much like the Ottoman empire itself), but it is the interior that really shines. It is easy to see that the last Ottoman sultan built his dream house \"on the backs of his subjects\" - he looted the treasury to build this masterpiece. The Waterford stair case spindles are jaw-dropping, as is room after room of silk furniture, exquisite ceilings and draperies. The \" jewels\" of the palace are its priceless Hereke rugs and the immense reception hall; never have I been more impressed with the scope and grandeur of a single room. Definitely worth a visit while you are in Istanbul."

The wait to purchase tickets was nearly an hour, and once you enter the grounds of the Palace, you must wait another 15 minutes or so to join one of the Turkish or English-guided tours. While the palace is opulent, it was a sadly disappointing visit because the mandatory tour groups are much too large to truly listen to what your guide is saying. Also, it was a hurried tour, and she seemed as if she was hurrying us along, rather than acting as a docent, which also detracted from the overall experience. Perhaps because Dolmabahce was built relatively recently, but the Baroque, Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical influences outweighed the traditional Ottoman architecture, and the palace disappointed in that respect, too. Oh, and one is forbidden from taking photos inside the palace itself."

From what I've read the lines can be endless and during the summer it can get very hot, so I'd definitly recommend going as early as possible. They give you three choices for the tickets, you would want to choose the second of thrid (the second is 30 TL and includes a guided tour in the palace/official part whereas the third is 40 TL and includes the guided tour AND a tour of the home of the sultan and his family. If you choose the third option they will amongst others show you the bedroom where Atat\u00fcrk spend his last days in 1938.) Unlike the Topkapi Palace, you can't walk freely in Dolmabahce Palace, you have to take the guided tour. They have tours every 20. minutes (every 5. minutes during very busy hours) You will be a group of about 35 people and a tour guide who takes you through the palace. You are not allowed to take pictures in the palace, which I found a bit disappointing. The place itself is amazing, a real-life fairytale! What impressed me the most was the chandelier weighing 4,5 tonns (it's the largest in the world.) There is also a cafe outside with a view of the Bosphorous and a souvenir shop.

It was inhabited from the year 1856 by six Sultans and the last Caliph. After the foundation of the Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk stayed in the palace for 4 years impermanently, between 1927-1938. The palace was used as a Presidential House during the period of Ismet Inonu till the year 1949, & was opened to the public as a palace-museum with its original furnishings in 1984.The main structure is divided into 3 functional places - The Administrative Part where the country's affairs were discussed, The Privy Chambers (Harem) where the Sultan & his family were living & The Grand Ceremonial Hall where the Sultan received notables of the state. The palace has 285 rooms, 44 halls, 68 toilets & 6 Turkish baths. As a monobloc building, it is the biggest palace in Turkey.Functionally & architectually, the palace preserves traditional Turkish house design of a hall in the middle with rooms surrounded, nevertheless, the Western originated arts such as Baroque, Rococo, Neo-Classic were widespreadly used. Thus, traditional Ottoman Style & cultural elements were molded with a Western concept & as a result a new interpretation was obtained.The Hereke carpets which have been used to decorate the walls & the floor, the Baccarat & Bohemia crystals, the Sevres & Yidiz porcelain, gifts by various state leaders & paintings by Western artists are quite imposing & interesting.Not as crowded as Topkapi, this is a quiet and romantic place. It was pouring with rain when I visited (cold!!) but I am sure it must be nicer in summer time."

Individual wandering is not allowed inside, so there are two queues for guided tours, one in Turkish, one in English. The tours start app. every 15 min, but only 20 people or so are allowed in each tour. From what we saw of the line, either go really early or you may get lucky around lunch time. We toured the palace June 2. At this time most of the Harem section was under renovations, the Crystal Garden was closed and the Clock Museum was closed. Usually the Palace has 2 possible entrance fees, one just of the Palace, one for the Palace and the Harem. Given that the Harem was under renovation, they combined the fee and included the open sections of the Harem in the Palace tour. Unfortunately the fee was on the higher side at 30TL/person. Given that the tour was less than an hour and most of our time was spent standing in queues, I'd give this Palace a miss. When the renovations are done and the other sections are open, this may be worth it. But until then, you're better off touring through Beylerbeyi Palace for the same over the top Baroque Palaces.

They only let in the number of people (20-30) who can be shown round by one guide. Tours are in English or Turkish, so there are 2 queues.The good news is that because you are shown round by the palace's own tour guides, this is one building that is thankfully free from ticket touts offering to help you jump the queue. The building has a special place in the hearts of Turks as it was here that Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the first president of the Turkish Republic, died in 1938. So not surprisingly Turkish visitors tend to be given preference.The building is huge and ornate. It was built as a replacement for Topkapi Palace by a 19th century sultan, who was determined to prove that the Ottoman Empire still had life in it; unfortunately to complete the building the vast sums borrowed sank the Ottoman economy into deeper gloom. However, you wouldn't guess this from the building which is over the top baroque from the entrance gate throughout all the suites of rooms, both public and private. When you are aware that the interior was designed by the architect responsible for the Paris Opera, it all makes sense. Whether it was in their public or private lives the Sultan and his family must have felt that they were living on a stage set. If you like baroque, then this is the place for you.The tour lasts about 40 min but the palace is so large that you are whisked fairly quickly from room to room. The guides speak excellent English and are delightfully polite; they are happy to answer questions but in groups of this size, it is almost impossible to go into anything in any detail. The fittings and furnishings are amazingly lavish and ornate. I would have liked to spend longer looking at the artwork in the corridors, but I needed to keep up with the group! The main areas that you will be shown are the huge public reception rooms and throne room, the Sultan's private apartment, which are almost as big, and Ataturk's suite of rooms.The palace gardens along the shore of the Bosphorus are attractive and well tended and a good spot to take photographs which you are not allowed to do inside.Our guide book said that there was a cafe/restaurant with views out over the Bosphorus, but the signs led us to a small cafe near the exit where you could take your drinks round a small fountain and fishpond. So don't expect a repeat of the facilities at Topkapi Palace."

            "review": "Quintessential Extravagance. I'd like to start this review by addressing some complaints of other reviewers. Most importantly, expect a long line to get a ticket. You will likely wait 1-2 hours so get there early, around 9-9:30 (tram stop is very close). And yes, you will be forced to enter the palace on a tour (less than 2 hours), without exception. This however, is not a burden at all and completely understandable. They don't want people wandering around the huge palace, taking pictures (no photos allowed once inside) and possibly damaging the furniture, and thereby ruining the site for everyone else. I was more than happy to follow the very knowledgeable tour guide who was more than happy to answer your individual questions. If you do go, expect a highly extravagant palace. It was built during the decline of the Ottoman Empire (mid 1800s) in an attempt to dispel the rumors that the Empire was in decline and going broke. Also, it was built to replace Topkapi palace as the home of the Sultans. That is why the entire design is so extravagant. There is a beautiful staircase in the entrance hall and the posts holding up the handrail are made of crystal. Also, at the end of the tour is a giant, 9,000 pound chandelier. If seeing such things will sadden you, do not go and perhaps do not visit a palace in general. However, if you are able to appreciate it for what it is, then I highly recommend going. The gate is also very impressive, as is the clock tower nearby. Also, you may want to go to the port of Eminonu and take a 1.5 hour ferry in order to see the palace from the water. I did not enter the harm (additional fee) because I read that it is not that impressive. If you would like to see a harem, I highly recommend the one at Topkapi Palace."

DOLMABAHCE PALACE, to describe this wonderful palace will be quite difficult, here is the palace which clearly shows the power, the vastness and the impact the OTTOMAN EMPIRE had on the world. The palace is designed in baroque style, the sheer magnificence of the palace is completely breathtaking. The crystal staircase, the massive chandeliers, the marble structures, the red room, the blue room,etc etc are all a must see. What is surprising why this palace is not the first attraction of Istanbul, as this would by far be the very best palace in the world."

The queues to get in are interminable: first you queue to buy your ticket (this can take hours and it is galling to arrive at the booth to find only one person selling, and explaining the details slowly over and over to each tourist); then you queue for your tour. There seems to be a charge to take in a camera - we did not get to the bottom of this, but I believe you are not allowed to take photos inside the palace in any case. NB Don't think it helps to arrive early: everyone says this, but in fact the queues were much shorter when we left around lunchtime than when we arrived. You have to put plastic bags over your shoes so be aware if you are elderly or not agile that there is very limited seating or space for this. I did not find much to interest me on the tour: the public rooms are very ostentatiously opulent (eg crystal bannisters) but don't as far as I know contain any particular works of art of merit. The private quarters were indifferently furnished and rather dull. Only the last room on the tour was particularly impressive - it was vast and plush and contained an almost comically enormous chandelier, a gift from Queen Victoria.We did not bother with the separate harem buildings (you do see some of the harem on the main tour).The setting on the water and the gardens are nice, but I think this place does not rank amongst the greatest palaces or gardens of Europe."

Queues.It was a quiet time off peek sesaon. 30mins buying a ticket. Followed by 1:30 mins to get in the palace. Then 20mins to get in the Harem.The harem as very similar architecture to the palace so if you are tight for time then skip.The clock museum and crystal palace were closed.The queue outside was 4 times the length than when I joined, no cover from rain nor sunshine in any of the queues plus no seating totally unsuiatle for the elderly.The architecture is a baroque style that is more equalled in European royal palaces and even stately homes so not special to Turkey. I managed to beat the queue by attending one of the Turkish led tours through the Harem. I didn't miss much as the English tour through the palace had mistakes, e.g. says the crystal was for England when it was from France.I'd have a cheaper price for the gardens and then a higher price for the Palace to cut numbers and run faster tours through. Maybe have an cheaper expess tour and a pricer slower tour."

Once you get your ticket, you go through the main gate and then onto the garden and a short walk up to the palace entrance.

Our first guide was really snotty and did not elaborate too much on the palace history. The tour of the main part of the palace only took 40 minutes. The second part of the palace, the harem is another tour (which you have to pay for separately). This means falling in line again to wait for your guide. The harem took 25 minutes to tour. Our second guide was much friendlier, thankfully. All in all, the palace is beautiful, but the touring experience is not worth it.

Not every visitor to Istanbul makes it to the Dolmabahce Palace, but is is one of the \"must see\" places, and if you have enough time in Istanbul it is worth the effort to get there. It is just a short walk from the main tram terminus!The rooms are well appointed, and you can only visit as part of a guided tour. There are English speaking tours almost every half hour, and it is worth paying the extra to visit the Harem part of the palace.You should allow a couple of hours to visit, and if you have access to a good guide book before your visit you will benefit from reading about the palace beforehand."

We spent 15 minutes to get through security, 1 hour 10 minutes to get tickets to go inside, then 30 minutes to start our tour. That was almost 2 hours of waiting!However, every tour is guided by a very professional guide in either Turkish or English (just make sure you know that you're going with the right guide), and the interior really feels like you're in a palace. Its a 1 hour guided walk, so try to be near the guide as you'll be with a group of 25 people.A big bummer was the lack of photography allowed. You can take pictures of the grounds which are stunning, but not inside. Big bummer.Quick anecdote: We thought we could avoid lines and go the Harem quarters. However the side entrance to the Harem was closed and there were no signs telling us this until we had walked all the way to the end of the palace. When we came back the line was longer :(Recommendations:-Go early, like 9am; we went at 1pm-Get in line straight away, don't try to go to the harem-take lots of photos outside and explore the grounds after-make sure your tour is in your language"

A relatively quick conducted tour rushes you through room after room and corridor after corridor of faded opulence but at the end you enter the Ceremonial Hall which is out of this world in terms of impact- a great pity no photos allowed anywhere in this the largest palace in Turkey. You will see the room where Mustafa Kemal Ataturk spent his last days, along with many other spectacular chambers, salons, hamams etc etc. We paid for the separate Harem which is a good stroll round the block from the main Palace and not really worth the effort unless you are really keen on history and old furniture, decorations and period pieces. You leave the palace by a small shop with not a lot to sell when we were there. Hard to find water but there is a cafe and facilities round the back by the entrance to the Harem. Timed entrances- small groups and conducted- and you need to wear overshoes- which can be hard to get on when there are no seats and not all visitors are under 21!"

The Crystal staircase and \"worlds biggest crystal chandelier\" are magnificent. Dolmabahce Palace was built to add a little more western feel than the previous Topkapi Palace which was made for the Sultans and their harem. It seems no expense was spared and yet the old habit of sitting against the walls was a hard habit to break. If you pay attention to the seating arrangements you can see that conversations were more one sided. I loved the western slant that they gave the palace. I found it more interesting than the Topkapi but, the harem's quarters and the jewels at the Topkapi should not be missed. Call for times and guided tours, they seem to change a lot."

It was definitely oppulant and extravagent - the crystal staircase, the amazing chandeliers. You can't take pictures inside the palace or the harem. You can only go through with a guided tour (which were pretty good and offered only in Turkish and English) which they split up and charge you separately for each part - the general palace, then the harem. You will want to see both and not feel like you've missed out on anything. I was a little suprised that some of the palace and harem were consistent with other mid to late 1800s residence that i\"ve seen before with furnishings and wooden floors, etc. The great ceremonial hall in the palace is massive and rivals some of the larger mosques and churches we saw. The harem (or personal apartment and family apartments) is interesting and each room is adequately marked with signs and descriptions. We also stopped at the cafe and bathrooms in between the tours - the cafe is a little overpriced but sufficient. We also spent some time in the clock museum in between the tours (since the tours run just about every 30 or so minutes) - which was more interesting than I expected. Overall, an interesting site and a must stop on a visit to Istanbul."

One of the chandeliers had been a gift from Queen Victoria but we were not told this in the tour. The guide frequently said the crystal in this part of the palace was all English but again no mention of the workshop from which it originated.

No doubt this palace is magnificent and historical and is an important monument, but:1) prices are a bit high (students take your ISIC cards, it is only 5 TL then)2) you can not visit the place on your own, you have to follow a guided tour 3) the guides (both in main part and Harem) hardly talked at all during the tour and just rushed us through the rooms at maximum speed possible 4) the palace is in fact a great example of \"europeanisated Ottoman\" style, but on a such a speedy visit, it gives an impression of \"just another palace\" in Baroque/Rococo style"

Columns were fake, but there were many impressive chandeliers and entry ways. The haram could easily have been skipped, saving a person 10TL - nothing there was half as impressive or interesting as the actual palace and it was just another line to wait in.The biggest problem with this place is the size of the guided tours (you must be part of a guided tour) and the lines. Thankfully we went on a cold Sunday morning and there was only one group tour there before us and a couple other individuals. We did not have to wait in line for very long to get tickets but it was pretty silly that there was only 1 ticket seller working - the other one was for group tickets only but no one came to her window the entire time we were in line & she sent people back into line if they tried to come to her booth. Once in we had to wait in ANOTHER line outside in the cold. The next tour was in 30 minutes so we walked the grounds. The tour group ended up being a good 50+ people - too many to have in one group along narrow corridors. They should have split the group. The same thing happened for the Harem, over 50 people and a 30 minute wait even though we were there on a non-crowded day. The only reason we liked the tour at all was because our first guide was friendly, had a great personality, and his voice carried very well. We spent 3 hours there, about half of it was waiting in line. I can't imagine if we were there at a busy time or, even worse, during their heavy tourism season!"

We were also shepharded into some 'display' rooms and made to wander through the porcelain/unpolished silver collections before re-joining the whistle-stop tour. It was far too rushed. Our guide said 'here is the crystal stair case' and then we were marched up it and into the next room. No time to really observe or appreciate. Our guide was fun but we felt very much that we were on a conveyor belt. Also, really weirdly, you have to put plastic covers over your shoes before entering. This is odd - and slightly dangerous - slippy plastic; carpet; quickly walking down stairs...I have never encountered this anywhere else in the world (including Windsor castle!!). We were walking on 'tourist' carpets anyway and the guide has his shoes (un-covered) on...so why did we have to dangerously glide round?! The toilet/cafe facilities are quite primative (only place in Istanbul I saw a squat toilet). A good companion to the Topkapi palace and a worth-while visit."

As you walk in, everything on one side will be matched by the same thing on the other. It was very much designed to impress as a visitor approached the sultan.

We didn't expect we can find such a western-style palace in Turkey! It is definitely understandable if you find this palace more magnificent than the Palace of Versailles in Paris and the Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna. Nevertheless if you are tired of luxurious palaces that can be found all around western Europe, I will suggest the Topkapi instead as it has more Islamic and Ottoman features. After all, Topkapi is more 'traveller-friendly' as it is in a walkable distance from Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque. Another kind reminder is that if you go with children, remind them not to touch the antiques. The staff there are quite rude to visitors who do so."

Entrance staircase is amazing.Cameras are not allowed inside though I did see quite a few ppl sneaking in the pics,in case u are interested in that.We took a tour and were not bothered much by queues(Also as it was winter off season though there was XMas crowd.)..If you want to go on your own then you can buy the ticket (there is per day visitor number limit) and stand in queue for the tour by palace guides.Individuals are not allowed entry without them.Palace guards are everywhere but we did not feel much rushed.Also as its a more of view palace rather than hear and read one. For tours there is a seperate queue.It did help us move faster than the non tour queue but am not sure how good it would be in peak seasons.Best way to avoid queues is to go to palace in the mornings.Definitely a must visit after you are done with SultanAhmet regular attractions.For tram users stop would be Kabatas.Also Princess island fairy goes from Kabatas so you can come here in the morning and then visit the islands."

We choose the Harem tour which takes about 30 minutes. We had to wait 45 minutes outside in the cold. There were about 50 people on our tour, which was too much for my taste."

The guard pacing by the gate along the strait is a good photo. The tour is a bit rushed and there is no time to linger, and that is a shame as it would have helped to better appreciate the palace."

It has a spectacular location on the shore of the Bosphorus, has beautifully landscaped grounds, and the palace itself has been well maintained. The last emperor who lived here fled in the 1920's and then was used as Ataturk's \"base\" in Istanbul until he died in 1938. Furniture remains inside the palace that is typical of what would have been used during the time that it was occupied. This palace is enormous, and is more extravagant than any other palace or museum we have visited. There is a huge ornate staircase with Baccarat crystal spindles as well as the world's largest chandelier at 5 TONS! The ceremonial hall where this chandelier is located is pretty spectacular in its own right with beautiful 118 foot high domed ceilings. We walked through the palace quite leisurely with our tour guide, but there are many guards that make sure that you stay beyond the barriers and don't take pictures. It was a shame not to be able to take photos inside the palace, but there is a small gift shop where you can purchase postcards that show many of the highlights. It's definitely worth a visit while you're in Istanbul!"

There are 285 rooms filled with 14 tons of gold, 6 tons of silver and massive ornate crystal pieces. We had scheduled a morning to visit and were so glad we did. You must be part of a tour which leaves every 15 minutes or so and though we were there off season, there was a line.

Harem is similar to the main palace and can be skipped if you are short of time. Guided tours leave every 30 minutes and walk you around only some of the rooms and halls of the 300+ rooms in this palace. Almost all rooms look stunning and yet, different, on account of the tapestries,carpets, furniture, and the grand chandeliers. Since the palace is not too old, it has been very well maintained and one can see it in its pristine condition. Guides speak good English and are very helpful. The Grand Reception Room has a huge chandelier and is the most opulent room in the palace. The harem section has a separate entrance and is similar to the main section. You can also get great views of the Asian side of Istanbul from the palace grounds.There is also a small cafe on the grounds, where you can sit and relax after the long walking tour(s). Since you cannot take any pictures inside the palace, do visit the palace store and pickup some postcards (2.5 TL for 10)."

No photos and no touching of anything along the way which took about 45 mins. If you are pressed for time and unable to stand in line for a long time I would suggest you give the palace a miss as there are better sights to visit in the old city. 20 lira for the official apartments and 15 lira for the harem."

Great views of the Bosphorous from the windows and outside on the grounds. The Palace itself is beautiful, with a great variety of chandeliers and other ostentatious trappings of wealth.

We chose the palace + harem ticket which was a little more expensive but we wanted to see both aspects. First stopped in the cafe as a sign said the tour was likely to take 2 and a half hours. The cafe offered stale bagels with no option for a topping at all, or a cheese sandwich, we opted for this. Was a piece of rubber cheese sandwiched between cardboard bread. Horrible! Then came the 30min queue to get into the palace. They let people in in 'batches', assigning approx 70-80 people per 'English speaking' tour guide. Due to the large numbers the guide had to address, we rarely caught the information in each room from start to finish, he was very quiet and speaking with a very heavy accent. The bits of info I did catch were saying 'this is the harem room. The harem room is where the Sultan brought his harem' - not all that enlightening. The palace was extremely hot - obviously not easily rectified but I think if they let people walk around at their own pace instead of as a huge group it would be more comfortable, they could offer an audioguide as an alternative. There were no leaflets in English at all. My husband was ushered out of a couple of rooms when they felt he was taking too long. Most of the paintings had a little area below them which was clearly meant for an information sign, but there were none. The building itself is stunning - amazingly opulent and gorgeous, but would be improved if things were given a dust and a hoover... All the huge amounts of crystal would have far more impact if it hadn't been covered in dust, and the silverware as well. We'd paid extra for the harem tour but this never happened, and the overall tour lasted 45 mins (this was actually more than enough for us, but it was clear that the tour had been cut short). We left feeling a bit cross and cheated!"

It provides a nice balance from the amazing historical and more ancient locations in Sultanahmet for instance. It is absolutely beautiful, for one thing. I had 2 tour guides. The first one, in the Administrative part of the palace was one of the best tour guides I have ever had bar none. He was simply fabulous and provided our group with an amazing amount of historical information, interesting tidbits, etc. He loved language and would say specific key words throughout the tour in several languages. The 2nd guide, the one in the Harem, offered almost no information or friendliness. It was a strange juxtaposition between the two. Two warnings: They are closed on Thursday- I tried to go on Thurs. last time I was in Turkey and didn't read ahead and got there (of course I was disappointed...and rightfully so-this is an amazing place to see!) with the gate closed. It is very very hot in the house. Granted I was there in August, however it was almost unbareable, so drink lots of water before going and dress accordingly! There are not a lot of open windows in the palace providing a breeze. I think this palace in many ways exemplifies a lot about modern Turkey through the art, architecture, furniture and by who lived there. It is an amazing combination of styles from around the world, and it melts them together beautifully. If you get a great tour guide, you are in for a real treat!Also, I would suggest, if seeing either the Administrative or the Harem, and you were to only choose one (b/c you have to pay seperately), I would actually choose the Administrative even though the Harem sounds sexier and more interesting. It is actually NOT that sexy and it is far less interesting. I would definitely advise seeing both, but that is my 2 cents for you if you only choose one."

To avoid the excess of visitors simultaneously inside the palace, the number of entries is controlled, it would not hurt if they were well organized, but they aren\u00b4t. It was a rare example of clutter that I found in my stay. This results in queues to buy tickets on the outside. After we acquired the tickets and we think we are already saved, again queues to enter in the palace. All tours are guided. Even the tourists alone have to wait for a guide and when he comes, may have some difficulties in english language. This also would have no problem if the visit was not at lightning speed. A word of advice, go get yourself leaving behind your group to better appreciate some of the pieces that are truly magnificent.

Specially true of the magnificent artwork it houses. Taking about closing time, the signboard said 4:30 but apparently it is 4. Anyway we were in the queue by 3. It took us 1.15hrs to reach the ticket counter and though there were about 15-20 people left the authorities decided they wouldn't let us in. Only after some Turkish people in the line protested, after a wait of 30 minutes we were let in. Unfair we thought. We had after all stood in line for over an hour. So go early and take in the wonders of the palace.BTW there is a wonderful place to eat in the grounds. It is on the shores of the Bosporus and offer stunning views. Though the menu is limited, the prices are remarkably low compared to Istanbul's other tourist attractions. Anyway you're going their for the views."

A 4.5 ton chandelier, for crying out loud, amazing! Grounds are also gorgeous. Tips:1) Arrive before 9:45 AM. The queue is an absolute joke if you don't get there early enough. You'll seriously laugh when you see the ineffeciency of the ticket booth. Also, plan to be done around noon-- the tours take quite a bit of time.2) Do buy the combo ticket for the Harem. However, be prepared for a very different experience for that part of the tour. It is not as opulent and I was kind of burnt out on beautiful rooms by then, but it's quite cool to see the apartments of the Sultan's many wives (and so strange to think of them all living there like it's The Bachelor or something)3) Bring your student ID if you have one-- most places in Turkey require a Turkish student ID card, but for some reason four of us were able to use our US student ID cards and got in for 1TL each intead of 20TL (!). Again, the ticket booth is a joke.4) Consider taking a bus from the nearby station up towards Rumeli Hisari (fortress on the Bosphorus with awesome views)-- check out the tripadvisor reviews for it, totally cool and only about a 45 minute bus ride away from Dolmabache"

The Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace was finished in 1856 and was the official otoman imperial residence from 1856 to 1877, and then from 1909 to 1922. It is the third largest ottoman palace in Istanbul. It is located by the Bosphorus with wonderful views. The main building (administrative area) is the most interesting one, with the crystal staircase and the Muayede Hall with the largest crystal chandelier in the world (4.5 tons and 664 candlesticks). The other buildings are also worth a visit, but if you are limited in time, choose the administration building."

We were taken back in the sultans' times and we realised the opulence and luxury they lived in. Even my 8 years old son was impressed and not for a second bored.Personally I would have liked to see the kitchens too ,to make an ideea about their cooking style (and scale !)On the downside , their organising (or rather lack of ) is horrendous. We queued outside the main gate to get inside ,then to pass the security check ,then to buy the tickets (20 YTL), then to get inside the palace , then to be allocated a guide (compulsory ) and finally to visit the harem. No joke , we waited in the fierce sun in total 3hours and a half !!! and the visit itself lasted nearly one and a half hour. Honestly ,so many waiting times , on a torid day , ruined my mood and my day . At some point I lost interest because I was so tired, overheated and frustrated. And the staff was rude and shouting ,like they were guarding the Heaven's gate. Inside the palace we were given an \"English\" speaking guide . I don't know how knowledgeable he was because I could 'nt understand him on the rare occasions when I could hear him.All in all the palace is beautiful and it worths a visit. If the management could organise the things better and get rid of the compulsory guided visits ,the wholle experience could be more enjoyable."

First of all the queue was unbelievably long, the good thing about going with a group is that you can take shifts standing in the queue. Fortunately there was a parade at the entrance which kept us entertained as we waited to get in. Ticket is for 20 TL and you aren't allowed to take pictures but it was a feast for the eyes. Apparently they take small groups with a free guided tour like every 15-20 people at a time so there is plenty of time for you to look around and enjoy. Rooms were impressive with all the luxurious furniture, chandeliers, paintings...etc. The gardens around the palace are beautiful and there are entrance gates right on the sea. It's said that President Obama, when visiting Istanbul, entered the palace from one of sea gates, as he took a boat. Lucky him, he didn't have to stand in that queue!! The bathrooms there are clean."

All in all, I think it was worth it but like I said, make sure you are in good shape and bring a hat because you may very well wait in the sun for a long time.Of course, the decoration is amazing, they tried to copy Versailles and succeeded.There is a very nice terrasse along the Bosphorus where you can eat a little something with the greatest view ever!"

Dolmabahce is not one of them!Is is full of the most expensively crafted ugliness bought from all over the world by a sultan aiming to prove his worth and western orientation, just before the empire ended.Spend your time in the Topkapi in stead, or the Rustem Pasha mosque or the Chora Church, Or the Sakip Sabanci museum, but dont go to the Dolmabahce."

It is well worth the visit and price of admission.When you buy a ticket you have a choice of which areas you will see. Get the one that gets you in to all the sections. Unlike most of the other museums, you are only allowed in the main house and the harem in tour groups. So check the schedules. We did it backwards in that we went to the harem first and then did the main house. That was fine and we missed nothing. The first thing you will notice is the scale of the harem is impressive. Everything is bigger than you would expect. The materials and workmanship is incredible. It is very obvious this house was built for a king. The flow of the harem also makes a lot of sense. Mustafa Ataturk died here and his room is kept the way it was on the day he died. The main building is just as impressive as the harem, but on a larger scale. There is crystal every where you look. The carpets and wood floor are incredible. Especially when you consider they are 150 years old. If you go, try to stick near the tour guide as they don't speak that loud and you will miss stuff if you can't hear them. At the harem they mark your ticket when you take a tour, but they didn't do that at the main house. I would take the tour twice, once to listen to the tour guide the second time to take in all you missed on the first tour. There is also an aviary on the grounds. They have some guinea hens and peacocks running around loose. What I thought was interesting is that they also have cats running around loose and they don't go after the hens. They also have a clock museum on the grounds. Besides the large number of clocks in the main buildings they also have a large collection in this building. I love all things mechanical and I would have spent a lot more time in this section, but the family is not into clocks and they moved along quickly. One thing I found annoying is that in most of these buildings you are not allowed to take any pictures when you are inside. Not sure why, but I wish I could have gotten some shots of the clocks. I don't know the schedule, but they do a regular change of the guards in front of the palace. It only takes a few minutes and it's neat to see the routine they go through. I would also add try not to be the dumb tourist, like the ones I saw, who jumps in the middle of their exercise to get a picture. The soldiers took it all in stride, but it must be annoying. This is well worth the money spent and you can easily spend half a day at the palace. Once you are done you can easily get to Taksim. I will warn you that if you walk it is a steep uphill walk."

Up until then, Topkap\u0131 Palace has been the residence for the sultans, still bearing the medieval life style and thus not meeting the mondane needs. Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, in that respect, is part of the modernization attempt of the royal family in architectural terms. Visiting the Palace without knowing the background information might be very superficial. Indeed, you can visit the Palace only with obligatory tours, either in English or in Turkish or with a private guide. I recommend you opt the private guide alternative where you can get access to more detailed and correct information. Under normal circumstances, an appropriate tour can take up to 4 hours whereas, official tours are limited to 1 hour which is too short to see it all. Gardens are beautifully kept with birds and ducks and peacocks around. It's forbidden to take pictures inside. I recommend wholeheartedly to visit this palace, a living splendor at the decline of an empire."

I like the current way much better. Staff was OK, no reason to complaint and I found 20 liras just reasonable for such a beauty. One should think of the costs of maintaining such monuments before complaining how expenseive it is...Although I would probably score a bit lower, I give full starts to at last partly offset the previous negative score which makes the palace rank very low among other to do's.

I visited Dolmabahce Palace in December 2010 and I have to say I preferred Topkapi Palace being authentic Ottoman, not a sumptuous European palace replica as Dolmabahce. Anyway, Dolmabahce is worth visiting. The only way to see the palace is guided tour in Turkish or English. I recommend visiting some 2-3 hours before closing time because tours are not too long at this hour and you see and hear just as much as you need (at least in my experience). Palace has two sections: Selamlik (State Rooms) and Harem. You have to buy separate tickets and I recommend that you buy the ticket only for the Selamlik tour, because there you see the most representative public part of the palace with Crystak Staircase and Ceremonial Hall. Harem was a private section, it's more modest, and 19th century European style furniture you can already see in Selamlik section. You save money and time this way.Of course, walk through the palace garden is wonderful, and also a sea view. You shouldn't miss the lovely Crystal Pavilion in the garden which is a real pearl. Taking photos inside is not allowed even without a flash."

So a tip would be avoid drinking a lot of water before you enter. And another tip would be to go with a guided tour as they are the only way of getting inside the palace.

If it's a review of the attraction you seek, then I must direct you elsewhere. If you're at all interested in how it came to be that we got in, then promptly left, indulge me.Joined a queue for the ticket office that snaked this way and that with it's 'tail' a couple of yards from a third of the way up the 'body', hence joined the tail and watched as countless people came through security and joined the 'body' of the queue, usurping those of us (like myself and my beau) stupid enough to have taken our places correctly. Eventually losing patience with the scenario which was seeing others lop 30mins+ off their waiting time, myself and my girlfriend 'readjusted' our place ahead of numerous interlopers, provoking a furious response from a few others in the queue. I'll spare you the details, suffice to say that it should have been the queue skippers and the inability of the attractions' staff to either provide barriers for appropriate queueing or to police the queue, that should have been the objects of disaffection.Eventually (c.80 (yes, eighty) minutes later) reached the front of a queue which was hundreds strong to find a ticket office staffed by one person. To describe this lack of staffing, lack of care, lack of involvement with the paying customer and lack of service as 'unsatisfactory' would be an understatement akin to saying that Rafael Nadal is not bad at tennis.Paid and entered.Made our way through the gardens to the Palace itself to find... another queue. Also lengthy. And not moving. Language from me that decorum (and the moderator) prevents repetition here and a decision (as time was short - I write this from the airport lounge) to just give up.The entry ticket was time stamped and, having spent about 10 mins or so on the premises, it was necessary to seek a refund. This, a straightforward and reasonable target, would not have been realised were it not for the kind assistance of a member of the Turkish 'Museum Police' to whom we turned in desperation. TL20 is not a lot of money, but it's a tidy sum for nothing in return.This attraction was the last of ten we visited during our Istanbul break. It encapsulated the very worst of the attitude of the Turkish Tourist Board towards the people bringing their custom to the country. That is, as long as you hand over the cash, then waiting times, unruly queues aplenty, and a total indifference to customer satisfaction is of little importance.A real shame.

On one hand, it's got some things worth seen, on the other, there's so many down sides that I don't really know.Pros first, it's a nice palace, beautiful building, great site by the bosphorus, beautiful chandelier (4,5 ton one) in the ceremonial room (the last room you see), other beautiful lamps, the very nice gardens and the cristal staircase are, I guess, the pros.On the down side, it's expensive, again, as the Topkapi palace, you have to pay for the palace and for the Harem separatedly, 20 TRL for the Palace and 10 TRL (I believe cause we didn't pay it) for the Harem. It closes at around 4 pm so be there early because it goes with a tour guide. Tours are done in english or turk only, you have to put some bags on your shoes and in august, with the heat, it makes your feet sweaty and unconfortable. No pictures under no circumstance on the inside and the guide we had, eventhough was a nice man, spoke not so good english and I couldn't understand most of what he said, also beeing a large group, you were either close to him or wouldn't hear anything. Also there was four people right behind us with someone translating what the tour guide said to french that really made it impossible to follow.The palace is magnificent on its side and on the furniture, well the little we saw. To me, it felt like they took away all the important furniture and placed all the rugs, chairs and sofas they could find scattered around the rooms. It felt like everything they had there, had been put there for display purposes. So unreal. We never saw the room where Ataturk died and instead we visited rooms and rooms full of chairs, libraries with no books etc.If you take the tram, line 1, to the end (kabatas) then walk for 5 mins you will reach the Palace, The entrance is on works at the moment (August 2010) but it's still easily reachable.So it's really up to you, whether to visit it or not."

The Ceremonial Suites are stunning - huge chandeliers, grand staircases, hundreds of paintings and thousands of ornaments. The only drawback is that you have to go through as part of a tour, and the one I went on was conducted at a rather rapid pace.The Harem is less interesting and perhaps a little shabby. On the day I visited people were allowed to wander through at their own pace, which was good.There are also good views onto the Bosphorus and a nice cafe.

For the tour through main palace, our guide was pretty lively, pretty understandable, and pretty entertaining so there we had a good experience. It doesn't hurt that the rooms are magnificent.In the Harem, our guide was bored and not understandable at all. Furthermore, quite honestly, the Harem rooms are not nearly as exciting so if doing it over again I would skip that portion of the palace.As a comment to the Palace itself, they should either have more frequent tours which would mean smaller groups (our group was really too large), or they should have audio guides so that people could move along at their own pace.

            "review": "Overdressed wedding cake. The staggering opulcence of this palace may be impressive, but I found it very shallow and artificial! It looks like an overdressed wedding cake ... totally out of place and nothing Turkish about it! It costs 20YL for the guided tour! And a guided tour is the only way to visit the palace. Our English group was a huge group and the poor tour guide (who tried very hard NOT to be friendly) gave info in an off-handed manner to those closest to her. After the first few rooms most group members lost total interest in what she had to say and it didn't bother her much. Though the info she gave was very informative and rich in fact. We didn't do the harem ... apparently not worthwhile. One positive thing is that one does see a lot of the palace at a reasonable price ... but do you really want to see endless passages ... But the view from the palace across the Bosphorus is worthwhile. My advice ... go to Europe and see the real thing! Who wants to see mock rococo in Turkey."

The blue Mosque has all the publicity but this Dolmabahce Palace (Dolmabahce Sarayi) is one not to be missed. The palace is so grand and beautiful. One has to experience it for themselves. You also get free English speaking guide which is a nice touch."

First, in the middle of august, full saison, there was only one place opened to buy ticket.After that, you have to wait the next visit, because you MUST join a group. You can't be free. So, one more time, you wait.When you are in a group, the guide walks and speaks too fast, you don't have the time to see details. And if you are at the end of the group, there are gards who say you, not kind at all : \"Join the group ! Join the group\" just like if you were a dog.So, I would not recommand to visit thos place. It's nice, but you can't appreciate it because of the awful organisation."

            "review": "Very poor tours.. As someone who has visited many palaces and stately homes in the U.K. and elsewhere, having to have a guided tour is often a bit of a chore, stopping you from browsing at your own pace etc. It can, however, sometimes be a revelation - opening your eyes to things you may have missed.Sadly, the only revelation about the tours of this place are how bad they are! Having paid 20L for the main palace tour and a further 15L for the tour of the harem (you can't go around unsupervised - I think that is the best word for the feeling you are given) we had expected some sort of quality level of guiding. Unfortunately, that was not the case. 40 or 50 people in a group with one guide is not good enough, particularly when that guide speaks quietly or lacks interest.Our tour guide of the main palace was just about O.K. - the tour was still too quick, you missed things if you didn't get near the front and at some points we were told nothing more than the very basics; but frankly the tour of the harem has to rate as the worst I have ever had - we were rushed around by a surly guide who seemed to have no interest in being there and less in actually saying anything. Her task seemed to be to get the group in and out as quickly as possible. By 2/3rds of the way through our tour, we and several others in our 'group' had become detatched from our guide, who had simply disappeared ahead with anyone who could keep up. In the end we exited the place perhaps 25 minutes after entering in the midst of a Turkish speaking group (they have tours in Turkish and English) who also seemed shell shocked by the pace of the tour.The harem lacked anything special to make it worth a visit on its own. Combined with the main palace and in particular the main ballroom it is fine as a building of interest and perhaps worth a visit, but frankly the guiding detracts considerably from this as a venue for someone wanting to enjoy an excursion. I would recommend the Topkapi way ahead as a site and the fact you don't get marched around by disinterested guides an absolute bonus."

            "review": "waste of time. Don't bother with this tourist trap. It's expensive to get in. Guards arbitrarily let some people enter with backpacks and make others check in theirs. The tour guides are the worst I've ever encountered. One - a tall, thin, bald man - was barely intelligible and kept barking out orders for guests not to talk with each other while he was prattling on. He also got verbally abusive to a elderly woman who complained to him about not understanding what he was saying. Another guide - a slim woman - was much nicer but had absolutely no useful information on the rooms she was guiding us through. \"This was used by the sultan's wife\" was about the level of information be could provide. When asked for more information she became impatient. Her goal seemed to be to get the tour over as quickly as possible. Which suited me fine since her tour was worthless. Unless you have done your reading in advance about this place save yourself the ridiculously high 20 YTL entrance fee and go somewhere - anywhere - else."

            "review": "Exquisite luxury - but not very Turkish. I quote a previous reviewer: \"Our tour was in acceptable English, but there was no time to linger or even look at most of the palace - guards were following behind and constantly moving us along. The guide had difficulty answering questions about material outside the scripted tour.\"  I bought the \"camera tag\" and took quite a number of photographs, but they were rushed because the guards were pushing the group along so fast. There was no time to examine some of the gorgeous objects in any detail and, as another reviewer noted, some fabulous objects of art were not well displayed. What should have been a delightful and educational experience was diminished by the feeling that all the guides wanted was a high thruput and they cared little about the people \"in the pipeline\". I rated my experience as high as I did because of the wondrous objects and decorations in the palace which I was able to see and photograph. Frankly, I got more out of later examining my photographs in detail than I did when I was actually there in the palace - a sad commentary."

            "review": "Over the top but a great place to see. Located on the Bosphorus Shore the Dolmabahce Palace was built by Sultan Abdul Mecit who in 1843 commissioned the building of this new palace. It was to be Ottoman-European Palace that would wow everyone, the designer for the Paris Opera was used to decorate the interiors and in 1867 the palace was completed.Entrance fee into the Palace is broken up into sections e.g. just the palace tour, the palace and harem, crystal palace ect. If you wish to take photos in the palace there is also another extra fee, they will give you a tag for your camera, HOLD ONTO IT! as I found I lost mine and another person on the tour also had this occur when you attach it to your camera, the ribbon isn't very long and comes undone easily.The Palace decoration is over the top. Being designed by the designer for the Paris Opera it is very French in deco in both the fabrics used, the paintings and chandeliers. I opted to go on both the Main Palace tour and the Harem Tour, if you do this by a combined ticket as it is cheaper than buying both separately. When you go to the main entrance of the palace they have a board stating what times the tours are. You can only go through the palace on one of these tours which are operated by the Palace. When I was visiting there was a Turkish tour and an English tour written up, I don't know if they do this in other languages. On the tour there was about 30 people. You have a guide who speaks extremely good English, and provides you with information about all the different rooms. You must walk only on the Red Carpet to help preserve the palace. Everything in there is ORIGINAL, and I couldn't believe how beautiful some of the items are in many of the rooms. The tour does seem to drag on a bit however when you come to the final room (the main hall) were the tour ends is wow, the painting of the ceiling, the chandelier everything in this room is amazing and very over the top. The Harem Tour was I felt a bit more rushed than the main palace tour, and is alot shorter, you do see the living quarters of concubines, wives and mother of the Sultan but after you see a couple of these it does get a bit boring. You do however on this tour see were Kemal Ataturk lived when he spent time in the palace and the room were he died. All the clocks in the palace are stopped and have been set at 9.05am the time that Kemal Ataturk died, so don't set your watch by any of the clocks.On the site there is also the Crystal Palace, which unfortunately when I was there was under construction. I believe that this is also another fee to go in, however the guard let me go and have a look for free (there are two other rooms in this area) and he was also very nice to inform me of the long corridor that leads from this area to the main palace which you can peak at through a crack in the doorway. The Crystal Palace is located next to the aviary. Also there is a very nice Clock Museum off to the left when walking to the Harem which I came across which I enjoyed. The day that I went to visit the palace it was raining, and be aware if this is the case you will have to put covers (which they provide) over your shoes. If you have time this is a great palace to visit however Topkapi is much more the \"Turkish\" palace were as this is very similar to palaces that are in Europe. To get there catch the Tram to it's last stop and then just walk about 5 minutes to the palace (much easier and cheaper than a taxi). I wouldn't go on an organized tour to this palace as it's easy to get to, and a tour will cost you twice the price for exactly the same as what you can do yourself."

            "review": "A bit disappointing. While our tour of the Dolmabahce Palace was comprehensive and conducted in almost faultless English, we were disappointed with the atmosphere inside and the way that they didn't seem to show the Palace off to it's best effect. In particular, there are a huge number of very impressive chandeliers as you walk round, but many of them were not illuminated, which left them looking a bit grey and dull. The decoration and fabric of the Palace is also quite impressive but just not shown off very well, which meant that we left with the feeling that the Palace was a bit cold, grey and could have done with a really good clean! As an example, the enormous ballroom contains the biggest chandelier I've ever seen (a few tons in weight), but it wasn't lit..it just didn't do the rest of the room justice!"
