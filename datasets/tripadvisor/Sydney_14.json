For the size of the building, there did not seem to be as much art as you would expect. And I therefore am sad to say that this will not be a visit I intend for some time from now. The place needs a freshen up and made a little more exciting, romantic and fresh"

You have to pay for this exhibition, but there are many areas of the Art Gallery that are free, and on a wet Sunday - it is a delightful place to spend some time. You can spend many hours walking around admiring the paintings. Other that the Archibald - the Art Gallery of NSW holds many other exhibitions throughout the year and there is always something for everyone's taste. There is also the caf\u00e9 for a light meal or coffee. A special place to visit especially if you are a visitor to Sydney."

It's a longer walk if you walk around the harbour shore. You'll find a magnificent historic building which has a modern addition. Some exhibitions are not free - for example the Archibald Prize. BUT it's worth the money! You will be surprised by the paintings. Some are huge, some small but all excellent and a little different from the norm. Most of the entries would have taken months maybe years to finish. The Archibald entries have to be or include a portrait. So many of the paintings are of famous people, but not all. I was blown away by the works and I'm very glad we toured the gallery."

It is easy to access by public transport or car parking in the domain or on metres in Lady Macquarie's Drive. We started with a coffee and cake on their outdoor terrace cafe overlooking the harbour. The Archibald is a famous portrait painting competition held every year of well known community figures. This year \" Barry\" won by Louise Hearman. It is a striking painting of the larger than life actor Barry Humphris famous for his alter ego \"Dame Edna Everidge\". I also enjoyed the Wynne prize which is landscapes this year won by five aboriginal sisters, the Ken family collaborative from South Australia telling the story of the older women protecting the younger women from attacks from men. It is a beautiful mythological representation in magnificent colours. \"Conservatory No 2\" by Leah Bullen won the Watercolor Prize. It has the wonderful feel of actually being in a beautiful conservatory. The Sulman Prize for subject, genre or mural painting had a fantastic \" Social Climbing \" painting of Dalmatians forming a pyramidal hierarchy by Joanna Braithwaite. The exhibition has gone on tour now. It is worth a visit."

            "review": "If you have time to visit only one museum in Sydney visit this one!. The Art Gallery of New South Wales, in my view, is the only museum in Sydney which compares favourably to the famous museums of the world. It's a medium sized gallery which contains pieces of art from different parts of the world and from different time periods. Different sections of the museum are dedicated to different geographies, for e.g.: 19th century European art; Aboriginal art; Asian art. There is a strong focus on Australian art with pieces ranging from the time of early white settlement to present day works.There is also a floor for contemporary art which I thought was a good addition to the mainly traditional paintings and sculptures of other sections.Overall it is a medium sized museum with a good range of varied small collections. Recommend it if you have three hours to spare in the city."

As a local I've gone to this gallery every year since I started school, sometimes for specific exhibitions, which I mostly enjoy (though the Masters exhibition was disappointing, the gallery in Canberra generally does better for international art), but also just to wander around my old favourites in the Australian art section. The free sections are plenty to walk around and have some lovely landscapes from federation Australia and before, including some Heidelberg School works and Tom Roberts. I would advise not to eat at the caf\u00e9 or go to the gift shop as they are pretty expensive and quite standard fare, pack a picnic lunch and enjoy it in the gardens outside, and there is a caf\u00e9 opposite that is a bit more reasonable for lunch. The good thing about the gallery is that is so large you can spend as little or as much time in as you like, I never do the whole thing at once. The design of the building is also lovely, especially the foyer and areas to the right when you first walk in. It is also lovely and cool on hot days."

I was so excited to be able to come to this as a once in a lifetime event and I travelled from Far North Queensland. I enjoyed the art work, there were some amazing entries and the peoples choice could have been a photo. Other art work was in the eyes of the beholder, it was especially hard to see the works or read the plaques due to the number of people. We could spend days at this gallery!"

The Wynn and Sulman entries on the whole excellent made up for it. If the $18 entry fee for the Archiblad et al puts you off choose from one or more of the other great galleries. Take time to have a look at the Yoshitoshi exhibition. This is a room of gorgeous Japanese prints. You will while away a lot of time absorbing the divine details to be found in the 100 prints. Give the cafe a miss though. The gallery still has not got this part of its operations working well.

Being visual art teachers and artists in our own right meant we had a very hyper sensitive critical eye. The Gallery was full of surprises, our main exhibitions that we'd come to see proved disappointing however the surprises came with the main collection, Manifesto, the early 20th century relief prints, collage and drawing prize which all made up for our disappointment for the main exhibitions that had originally bought us to AGNSW. Sydney-centricity was alive and well in the choice of artists in the Archibald, skills and composition aside the artists seem to have been chosen rather on some sort of social/cultural standing in Sydney society, something i'd been previously unaware of until seeing firsthand. The Archibald gave me a greater understanding of Tina who has singlehandedly championed the Black Swan Prize for Portraiture in the west.Cafe food was fine. One day stretched to two and we could have come back anther but were booked back home."

We left feeling far better informed about the lives and works of these important artists.

If you do wish to see a special exhibit - book your tickets online ahead of time, saves waiting in the queue and some of them, like the Frida and Diego exhibition, have timed tickets. The permanent exhibits are also very good, with a wide range to look at. There is a caf\u00e9 on the lower floor catering for lunches or a quick snack which was quite nice.

We came specifically from Perth in WA to see the Archibald and the Frida Kahlo/Rivera exhibition, but made the Rookie error of not checking what exactly was in the Kahlo exhibition, ie practically no paintings of note, displayed in a cramped, corridor-like space with a shuffle along queue. Don't take more than 2 seconds to look at anything or one feels guilty. Not a good chance to see interesting work. Lots of biographical detail and lots of photos of them( repeat cramped shuffling queue) but this is just filler, which you can read anyway in other media. Maybe this is just another example of the antipodes getting the lesser works.The Archibald was inconsistent, but worth seeing and the trick for all shows is to purchase tickets in advance. Save more shuffling in a queue.Downstairs cafe food: roast glazed ham and roast veg for $18 was excellently tasty!The main collection is a delight and a salutary lesson to some of the painters exhibited in the Archibald downstairs. We are coming back tomorrow to spend time with the rest of it!"

The Art Gallery of NSW is always a wonderful place to visit, with so many famous, exciting and diverse works of art to see - free of charge - in magnificent galleries. Further, for a small charge the Archibald, Sulman and Wynne Prize Exhibitions are well worth seeing. The Archibald winning portrait of Barry Humphries should alone justify a visit. Externally the Gallery is architecturally striking and is fronted by the expansive lawns of the Domain and is adjacent to the Royal Botanical Gardens, another place of natural beauty.. Want a marvellous half day visit In Sydney, then go to them all, you won't be disappointed. A must see."

A beautiful building which holds a great collection of Australian Art, and showcases some fantastic, changing exhibitions of both local, historical and international art. The main gallery collection - hung in the original galleries to the right once inside the entry, has a great range of works and there is no charge to enter this area. Changing exhibitions are through the other galleries and you need to purchase tickets for these in the main area once inside the gallery. There is a cafe with an outside deck on the lower level, and the restaurant is on the same level as the entry. Check out the AGNSW website to find out what exhibitions are on during your visit."

That being said, Art Gallery has an outstanding Oriental Division which holds an exhibition on Calligraphy and Japanese Woodblock Print. On top of that, there are other divisions that focus on Aboriginal art, Contemporary art, early European and Australian art. There's also a superb caf\u00e9 that overlooks the Bay and the place buzzes with positive and dynamic energy. You will have an outstanding day outing at this Gallery. Highly recommended!"

However for many years I worked in the Sydney CBD and visiting the art gallery at lunchtime every few months became a habit of mine. I feel at peace in this place with many beautiful pieces of art to watch and occasional special exhibitions. One of the best surprises I ever received happened here. There was a painting which was already a favorite of mine for years because the scene depicted by it was so captivating for me. I had no idea that this painting was actually housed in this gallery. And this was a wonderful surprise in one of my early visits. Many lunch breaks I would visit the gallery to watch this painting alone. The gallery is not fussed about you taking pictures as long as you don't use a flash. But I found my favorite painting was already depicted in high quality on a card that I could Purchase at the gallery's gift shop. And I bought two copies. There is also a cafe at the back of the gallery which offers nice views. Last but not least the gallery is free and just minutes away from the CBD and the Botanic gardens."

The restaurant in the gallery provide a nice place for a rest with drinks and snacks if you need some recharging during your visit. Worth to spend a few hours if you are an art fanatic. Simply a walk in this gallery is relaxing."

There is good parking for people with disabilities ( phone up to find out about it.) However, exhibitions are often too crowded, especially on Sundays, so go early during the week if you can. Creative attempts to popularise exhibitions are generally noisy and demonstrate lack confidence in the work themselves. The view from gallery eateries and the seating is great, but there is not enough sensitivity to those with food intolerances. I joined the gallery, happy to pay more to view exhibitions in a quieter setting and to spend time in the members lounge. I wont renew my membership, because the member exhibition was even more crowded than those open to the public. The member lounge is delightful, and almost worth the membership fee, but the guy serving the food did not know the ingredients of the offerings, which made it impossible to check if they were suitable. More allergy-aware catering in the members lounge, and less crowded free members exhibitions would make the joining fee worthwhile."

Long queues, only two people selling tickets, poor planning. They should know better. The event happens every year and it's very popular among locals and outsiders! They need to lift their game.

It is conveniently located, near the beautiful Botanical Gardens in downtown Sydney.The large, imposing building is made of orange sandstone, and has a classical Greek Revival look from the outside. Inside, it has high ceilings and a feeling of expansive spaciousness. The collection varies from contemporary art, to European art as far back as the 17th Century, to Aboriginal art of all times. Indeed, the emphasis is on Australian artists. And here we learned a lesson: Australians, be proud, your artists are as good as the world\u2019s best. The highlight, in our opinion, was Australian art post-1900, although we felt that the contempo art at the Museum of Contemporary Art was better. Nonetheless, the Art Gallery of New South Wales was well-worth the time.There is a formal restaurant, and a large and busy cafeteria.As with all of our 5-star reviews, we freely declare that we have no personal or financial connection to this institution."

Recently visited the gallery for the Frida Kahlo-Diego Rivera Exhibition and purchased multi-visit passes, very surprised that each pass had to be purchased and paid for separately making it a time-consuming process! Loved the exhibition, taking into account there was only a very small number of works. The permanent collection was well worth the time taken to look around and beautifully organised.Made the mistake of going to the cafe for lunch and it was a nightmare! Massive queues that took forever to move, staff could only serve one thing which contributed to the long waits. I couldn't get a chocolate milkshake for a reason I couldn't understand and the tea was undrinkable. I couldn't find any water and the serving staff were very ordinary. An unpleasant experience I certainly won't repeat!"

My daughter wanted to visit the Gallery to see the Archibald Prize portraits, so off we set with wife, 6 week old grandson and 16 year old son completing the line up. Disappointingly for us, the queues for the Archibald Exhibition were mammoth and so we elected to visit the standard galleries (free of charge) and come back another day for the portraits.The galleries were a delight and I loved the un-stuffy presentation and accessibility. It was great to see lots of school classes in the galleries and the children seemed to be interested and having a great time. Stand-outs for me were the Aboriginal & Torres Straits Islander exhibits on Lower Level 3, the Australian cubism selection and Alphonse de Neuville's depictions of the 4th Hussars Regiment charging at Tarragona, and the Defence of Rorke's Drift.We had a very nice lunch in the Gallery's cafe and I also noted there is a more up-market restaurant Chiswick, which is an offshoot of the well-known and excellent restaurant of the same name on Ocean Street in Woollahra. The Gallery's shop had a particularly comprehensive selection of art-related textbooks. I think this is a first-class gallery and absolutely worth multiple visits."

Only about fifteen or sixteen paintings of Frida's I think and maybe three or four of Diegos. Lots of photos that I had already seen and let's face it, you can see photos anywhere.

We were fortunate enough to visit La Casa Azul (Blue House) in Coyacan in Mexico last year but, by far, the best exhibition of her work was at the Scuderie Quirinale in Rome in April 2015 where an extraordinatry collection of Frida's work was on display. If you are a fan of Rivera, which we are not, then you might feel satisfied with the exhibition, but the real drawcard is Kahlo known for work and her sad life story, and the exhibition did not provide some of the fabulous works that were in Rome. Of course, it's all in the eye of the beholder, but I wouldn't recommend or say it is a 'must see'. I know this was curated by AGNSW staff but I feel they 'missed the boat' on this one and concentrated too much on her life story, letters and film, rather than her incredible works of art, even though the two are inextricably intertwined.. Full marks, however, for timed entry, as this is a huge bonus and good to see that we're finally catching up with Germany and many other savvy European countries who've been doing this for a while."

When you leave take the walk through the botanical gardens to the opera house (or do this in reverse order). It is a beautiful prelude or postlude to the gallery.2. Note that special collections (such as Frida and Diego on now) cost extra. Also, there are long ticket and entry lines on weekends. Plan to buy tickets in advance or wait for a weekday.3.

The licensed restaurant and caf\u00e9 have large windows facing the north east, too. I love the Australian impressionist paintings in this gallery, represents the best of an era, for me. I also like the European paintings that come and go like unseen gems, in and out of storage. There are usually Asian works, aboriginal art and sculpture exhibitions, in various wings each time you visit. But the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes always excite me. Hahaha, many years ago even I entered my na\u00efve paintings in the Wynne Prize, 10 years running, and I never had a chance of hanging, but I tried, which gave me great delight. So there is something for everyone at the Art Gallery of NSW. The shop is also quite enjoyable, so make sure you leave some time to visit it.

The location is fabulous but the place feels very old world and stuffy. We traveled here to see the Frida Khalo & Diego Riverea exhibit and found the space to be small and the works crowded into corridor formation which felt claustrophobic. I would have been great to be able to walk around the exhibition in a brighter space like that of the foyer."

I was here during the Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, which was sold out and there were queues with the lucky ones waiting to go in. There is a lot going on at the Art Gallery. Another exhibition focusing on the Tang dynasty.At 11am there are two guided tours: Aboriginal art and collections highlights. At 1pm there is one on contemporary art while at 2pm, one on Australian art. I would recommend breaking the visit in two if one can do it so one is not too overwhelmed with the collection covering all the themes treated in the guided tours.There are two caf\u00e9s, one self-service at lower level 1 and the other \u00e0 la carte on ground level, with spectacular views. They both open till late afternoon and on Wednesday till 9pm. You have a place to enjoy a meal and proceed with the second part.There is also a gallery shop with a comprehensive range of art books as well as merchandise like posters, cards, gifts even those made from the exhibitions like the Frida Kahlo bags. Great place to get souvenirs for your loved ones.The gallery opens at 10am daily and is opened everyday including Sundays.A bonus? They also have free WiFi, what more can one ask for? A great place to spend a delightful day!"

            "review": "A 19th Century gallery but with brave efforts to bring it into the 21st Century. I have been visiting the AGNSW for about 60 years. Living interstate, I now go to Sydney a couple of times a year but always try to fit in a visit to see new exhibitions, as I did a couple of weeks ago. It always feels like visiting the home of an old friend, comfortable and welcoming, but not as stimulating as the experience of visiting the many galleries around the world that have been designed and built in the late 20th or early 21st Centuries. Indeed, all art galleries that were built over a century ago, catered to attitudes to exhibiting (and experiencing) art that were very very different from those today.A number of years ago, the AGNSW undertook a major reconstruction and rearrangement of its facilities, to overcome some of these limitations and make it more suitable for modern needs. These did succeed in a number of ways, particularly in providing large glass walls that opened up vistas to the Botanical Gardens, the sea and the Woolloomooloo area. They also provided outdoor seating in the restaurant with similar views. Most importantly, the lower-ground-floor area used for temporary exhibitions is now very appropriate to displaying the big block-buster exhibitions they frequently stage. But it was always going to be a juggling act, trying to maintain what is unquestionably a beautiful old heritage sandstone building, with modern requirements for lighting, air-conditioning and so on. And the re-design did not make it more sculpture-friendly. Given the nature of the building, it was not possible to have, for instance, a central sculpture court such as the National Gallery of Victoria was able to incorporate into its much more modern 1960s design. As a result, the AGSW leaves one with an impression that it is dedicated almost solely to 2-dimensional art.Given that this houses and must display a large standing collection, it is not dedicated primarily or solely to temporary exhibitions (like the Kunstverein network in Germany). That role is played very well in Sydney by the Museum of Contemporary Art, near Circular Quay, and anyone dedicated to contemporary art may prefer to head there. In the AGNSW, there was always a need to continue displaying the \"old favourites\" such as the 19th Century European works, and Australia's own painting history such as the Heidelberg School works. A signal policy change during the time I have been visiting, is the decision to display a large and growing collection of Aboriginal art, primarily paintings on canvas but with some earlier bark-paintings, funerary poles etc. In fact, after my recent visit, I was left wondering why one has to go down two levels (by escalator or elevator, admittedly) to see the Aboriginal art. I would think the Gallery administration might well re-think this, and put the historical 19th Century Australian material down there, and bring the Aboriginal work up to the entry level. Not only is much of this work artistically superior, but I believe it is of greater interest to many of the overseas tourists that make up a large percentage of visitors. I have spoken to some of those who, with very limited time available for their visit, never made it down to the Aboriginal galleries, and were very disappointed to see mainly the sort of regional historical work that fill the walls of galleries around the world, with a remarkable sameness. Only Australia has Australian Aboriginal art in large quantity, and we should proudly flaunt it."

This is one of the must see attractions in Sydney. Located next to the beautiful Royal Botanic Garden. only 15 minutes walk from the city centre. The main collection here is free, and absolutely stunning. My children enjoyed so much at the last visiting. There\u2019s some free activities for children (my boys are 10 and14years old), they also offer workshops during the holidays but need to book in advance."

Great transformation of the gallery space to accommodate a large collection of famous international pieces and some lesser known local artworks. Cafe is good to grab a quick bite and make good coffee. Often enjoy sitting outside post exhibition, gallery book shop also boasts a solid collection of art and design books!

There is so much history there, if the walls could talk, they would have ALOT to say.Its absolutely fantastic that there's so many free exhibitions. It is great that you can be having a 'free' day out in the city, and include an exhibition. Some of the exhibits cost, but most are free, and it doesn't really cost that much anyway. Check out the gallery website, or brochure on all exhibition time and cost. My son (12.5) and i went to see the Art Express exhibition, which features a selection of the previous (2015) yr 12 art work for the HSC. This Exhibition runs from Nov / Dec until April /May - check with the gallery for the exact dates. This is an absoluty fantastic exhibition to see. It is great to see so many budding artists in the midst. Any oversized bags/luggage will need to be stored in the cloakroom at the front entrance. Quite convenient considering that the gallery is on 4 levels. There are lifts right throughout, and escallators. There is a restaurant on level 2 that serves all kinds of yummy eats, and gorgeous drinks and its quite reasonably priced, considering where it is located. This is a great place for all ages, because they have hands on areas for the little kids ( only in some exhibits) . There are so many exhibitions going on at once, there's definitely something for everyone. Access to and from the Art Gallery is easy. There are busses that go directly to and from the door.The Royal Botanic Gardens are right opposite the Gallery, and if you are feeling like a nice strole, take a walk through, it's very pretty, and about a 12 minute walk to The Opera House, amongst other places to go. Just follow the signs. The Botanic Gardens is also free. You can have a picnic in there, learn a little bit about Horticulture, or simply just stroll through. If you want to head back in to the city, you can head straight upto Macquarie St, in front, or Hyde Park, off to the left. But which ever way you choose to go, you can be assured that the footh paths are very safe, and suit not only foot traffic, but bikes and scooters also. OHighly recommend this for a fun day out, suitable for all ages!!"

However 20 years later I attended an exhibition with a friend who is a member, early this year, and after we'd viewed the exhibition we went for a wander - I have to say their collections have vastly improved and the gift shops are a great place for gifts and souvenirs (especially for the hard to buy for people in your life)."

I know, you read the reviews about doubtful visitors who art not certified art lovers, but do visit here even if it is not a rainy day. From the outside, it looks like a classical museum but inside a modern, flexible new museum has been inserted and it is delightful. The first floor to the right is a restoration of the 19th century museum, with some European classics (Rubens, Canaletto) and local work; but if you take the left side, it is a history of Australian 20th century art. Who knew there was Australian Cubism or Social Realism or Impressionism? Discover local favorite Margaret Preston- those are her woodcut prints on the shopping bags from the excellent museum shop. Downstairs has European modernism (Picasso, Monet) and contemporary Australian art. Overall this is as they say a place for Art and Ideas. If you like to see and consider beautiful things you don't need to be an art expert. It was all free the day we visited, but there may be extra charges for some exhibitions. There is a good cafe and a formal restaurant, but we liked the Pavilion restaurant in the park across the street. The museum is adjacent to the exit from the Botanic Garden and a 30 min walk from Circular Quay"

The gallery is in the Domain, near the heart of Sydney. It awards the Archibald Prize, Australia's top prized for portraiture. The Aboriginal and modern Australian collections are good, but I always feel a little let down that some schools of art are not well represented. The National Gallery of Victoria's collection has benefited immensely from the Felton Bequest. I would never bypass a chance to visit the Art Gallery of NSW."

Most of the exhibits were clearly labeled, lending even the most limited viewer an understanding of the art. Most of the employees were friendly and willing to engage in conversation about the nearby pieces. It lacked a stuffy, clinical atmosphere, and as such would be a great place to take children - or even adults who might be slightly intimidated by other art museums. We saw several school groups, of various ages, present.Paid tickets were required for the featured exhibit -- which looked fascinating -- but it was not necessary to have an enjoyable time. (The gift shop featured a large selection of reproduction and collections of the featured artist, so one can get a good feel to decide if it was worth the price or not.)Quite a bit of space was dedicated to aboriginal art, both traditional and modern, which was appreciated. There even was a remarkable protest piece that really captured and expressed the tone and feeling that most likely many oppressed native peoples share.The cafe served the most wonderful lemonade and provided yet another spectacular view of the harbor. My husband also experienced his first vegemite spread on toast there. A culinary shock he will not soon forget!"

Excellent selection of European artists (mostly not Scottish) and even a Canadian painting of the Niagara Falls which has its own hanging place. We enjoyed it especially some of the hand sketching, and preparatory works by the greats. The price was reasonable for the extent of the exhibition and if you enjoy art, then allow more than a hour to make your way through. As part of the fee, you automatically have access to audio guide which worked well and supplemented the information provided on the description cards attached to the paintings."

On those nights they also have other entertainment - Friday being the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra.This was a wonderful group of musicians playing Baroque music on traditional instruments which was beautiful and enjoyable. We also had a quick meal in the cafe beforehand and the service and food were both very good and reasonably priced. definitely recommend for a quick bite. The exhibition was very good and the free audio tour was very informative. Once we had seen the exhibit we were able to wander around the main floor enjoying the work of Australian and other artists. The Art Gallery is free however, there may be charges for special exhibitions. As we were leaving it began to rain but this was no problem as there was a courtesy bus to the train stations in the city which ensured we made an early train. Something we would not have done if we'd walked to the closest station. Definitely recommend as it is a short walk from St James Station and also to Lady Macquarie's Chair, the Domain and the the Botanical Gardens."

The Australian Brandeburg Orchestra was playing as we arrived and it was very well attended. The Greats had some excellent art from the Scottish National Gallery. The ground floor of the gallery also offered some excellent art. It was well worth a visit and quite novel to go at night.

After seeing so many advertisements in newspapers over the last couple of months regarding this exhibition you would expect the signage within the gallery to match the earlier fanfare. No so, we needed to ask for directions. We arrived at the door of the exhibition and were offered a free audio guide [ a plus]. The guide outlined in brief some of the major works and offered some interesting features but it could have been so much better. The small signs beside each painting were in a small font and often gave the name of the artist, year, and the gallery it came from. Other galleries give more information for those who seek to find out that little bit more. The main galleries within the gallery are great but again the signage lets it down. The map could also be improved."

The major drawcard of this place is that it is where the Australian art scene showcase their best works for the year and are awarded prizes, such as the Archibald Prize for the best portrait. The other thing that annoys me about it is that it can be a little difficult actually getting to, since it is located on the other side of the Domain, which means a decent walk (or a bus ride) from the city centre. Still it is a place that I've really got to come back to some time to spend some more time there."

There is a collection of art from early colonial times to modern day with many of Australia's best known artists being represented. There's also a comprehensive and diverse collection of Australian Aboriginal art and also a section on Asian Art.There are free tours that take about an hour. These cover Aboriginal Art, Asian Art and Contemporary Art and the guides are very knowledgeable but also invite the group to contribute thoughts and reactions. This art gallery is challenging to do in one day so, if time is limited, be selective."

There is no doubt that Melbourne hosts Australia's best gallery with the substantial donations made by its residents its collection of Australian art is unrivally even by the National gallery which boasts some great collections of some artists. Sydney on the other hand needs more room even though there was one previous major expansion. It is the home of the best portrait competition in the country which produces the inevitable levels of controversy each year. It is a collection on permanent display that is at best patchy though it has some arears of strength. Ultimately one feels that it has some iconic pieces but that it has collected art almost by chance buying when the price is right. Having said that it does possess my favourite Brett Whitley - of Sydney Harbour a must see."

On a weekend you can drive and park in the nearby domain car park for a flat fee of $10. The gallery is free although some exhibitions cost money. Currently showing is \"The Greats\" - masterpieces from the National Gallery of Scotland. This is magnificent and includes some of the greatest European artists. It goes until mid Feb and is a great opportunity to see over 70 works, most of which have never been seen in Australia. There are plenty of other galleries to visit such as Aboriginal art, Asian and Australian. Security guards seemed to be a bit on a power trip but otherwise it was very enjoyable. There is a choice of two places to eat; the cafe, which looked very nice and opens at 10am and then there's Chiswick at the Gallery Restaurant which opens at 12. We dined here and found it to be very very good. The Art Gallery is a wonderful place to visit in Sydney and spend a few hours."

On entering the building, on the ground floor, you will find a permanent collection of Australian & European paintings hung in a historic part of the gallery. The main entrance hall is hung with contemporary paintings, which are very large and eye-catching, often by indigenous artists. To the left, is the gallery Shop containing many covet-able items, from art to postcards, books and more. There are many other galleries on the entrance floor containing well known Australian artists or a permanent collection of Asian art. Head downstairs for special exhibitions, like the yearly Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes for portraits, landscape etc, very popular with the locals. A couple of floors down the escalators are the location of exhibitions of contemporary art, and installations. And the gallery cafe. And if you are a Friend of the Gallery (or a friend of a Friend!) you can avail yourself of the members lounge and cafe - a very comfortable location with an excellent smaller cafe, and stocked with shelves of Art books.I go several times a year to recharge."

Let me explain the title of my review: as I walked up to the Gallery there were names of Renaissance Masters including Botticelli all around the outside walls. This naturally made me think that they had a big Renaissance collection. So I asked at the counter if they indeed had any Botticellis, at which point the gentleman noted that it was more an aspiration rather than fact. And that they hoped to get one in a few months time. He pointed me to their Renaissance gallery (more on that later). This somewhat puzzled me. Yes, Renaissance art is lovely (I am personally a huge admirer) but the museum has such an amazing collection of aboriginal art. Why not celebrate that more visibly? Don't get me wrong, the museum does seem to pride itself on its aboriginal collection. I joined the free tour and our guide was most informative and it was clear that aboriginal art has come to be regarded highly in Australian history and culture. I just found the contrast between the outside and inside rather puzzling and somewhat implicit reflection of how aboriginal culture is still treated compared to European art. Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the gallery. The aboriginal art pieces are absolutely wonderful and do join the guided tour. You learn a lot and our guide was excellent. When I visited there was also a \"Body Parts\" exhibit which was excellent too and right next to it you could see Moderns by Matisse, Cezanne and Picasso. Absolutely worth the visit in themselves. I did visit the Renaissance gallery too. There were some nice pieces of Renaissance art there and off in a smaller room there was a lovely painting by Constable (after Claude) which was itself worthwhile. And don't be afraid to head downstairs towards the study library ... you get to see some wonder Australian Majolica in the cases. There is also some nice 19th century Australian art. But you need more than 3 hours to fully enjoy this place (and I didn't have that much time). But then if you have the chance, you can go again and again. It is that kind of place. You won't tire of it."

There was a fairly long queue and we were a little daunted, but it moved quickly and we purchased our tickets from a particularly lovely and friendly young man. The gallery has many rooms that are free to visit and one could spend a whole day there without it costing a thing. Because we wanted to see the Archibald paintings we did need to pay, but the price was very reasonable. There was plenty of viewing space and the whole experience was very pleasant. Afterwards we took a stroll through the lovely Botanic Gardens and had a thoroughly enjoyable day."

Across the domain park about ten minute walk from Martin place. You can cut through the parliament buildings. There are a couple of walkways that take you through to the domain from Macquarie street. Nice and quite location. Coffee shop in the park open before the museum opens at 10am. Museum also has a coffee shop and restaurant. Free entry but there is a fee to see the main exhibits. $15.00 for the famous Archibald and for $25.00 you can see that plus another exhibit. Bag storage available for free at the front door. A great place to escape the city but tip is to get there at opening buy ticket and go straight to exhibit. Gets busy by 10.30 with all the group tours and school kids. Guided tours at certain times. If your into art or not this is worth a visit especially when the Archibald paintings are on display."

The art is always changing, so much care goes into the presentation of exhibitions. A good starting point for visitors to Sydney is the intersection of Market and Elizabeth Streets;( St James Train Station or the bus stop close by in Elizabeth St). Walk across Hyde Park, past the Archibald Fountain and across College St. From here a pleasant stroll along Art Gallery Rd. The gallery is free to enter, leave your coats and bags at the cloakroom (also free) and get a map at the information desk. There is a charge if you want to visit one of the special exhibitions but there is so much to see if you just want to wander around. Go and see the amazing collection of indigenous art. The coffee shop is good for drinks and wraps and the gift shops for souvenirs. Wear your walking shoes and extend your trip by walking through the Botanic Gardens and down on to Circular Quay when you have finished."

Had a great time taking in the inspiring Archibald Prize, Wynn, Sulman Prize and other wonderful examples of Australian art. No matter if you agree on the ultimate winning entries there is so much to do and see plus it offers the opportunity to walk no matter what the weather is like outside. What a wonderful afternoon it just kept getting better with the sunshine outside offering us spectacular scenes of the harbour nearby we roamed around the gardens and enjoyed afternoon tea at the Pavilion in the Park just opposite as we watched the world go by. It would be a lovely spot for a long lunch if we'd been just a little earlier, children played hide and seek, parents sat on blankets on the lawns watching and chatting, others stretched out on deck chairs finishing off wines as the restaurant staff busied themselves clearing tables the occasional local bird descended to steal food scrapes. Winter is mild in Sydney most years and with the exception of a few days it is very pleasant to be in this city and see the sights. This is a highly recommended place to visit for locals and visitors alike, you will pay is $15 for adults with concessions for pension card holders, children and family passes for two adults and up to 3 children are $40 so it does make it affordable to provide a great day out. Sometimes to view your own city as a visitor would makes you feel so proud, we drove and parked easily at the meter parking in the Domain, however watch the time as we did see a few people being booked for overstaying. Public transport by bus or train (St James Station or Circular Quay are only a short walk away and you can relax completely."

The Art Gallery of NSW is situated in the Botanical Gardens and easily accessible from the CBD or by ferry to Circular Quay. Take the opportunity to stroll through the Gardens which make a nice contrast to the art on display. The spaces in the Gallery are airy and uncluttered and the new additions work well with the original sandstone building. For children there are dedicated activities, especially on weekends and during holidays. Entrance is free, except for special exhibitions.At the moment, the Archibald portrait exhibition (Fee is charged) is the main draw card. I found the standard this year to be very high. Please don't forget to look at the Young Archies, which are portraits by children. Some of the explanations for their choice of subject make for interesting reading. There is a warmth, fondness and playfulness to these portraits. There are rooms dedicated to Asian and Aboriginal Art and once you have finished, or perhaps in between browsing, the cafe offers a tranquil view over park lands and the harbour, as well as good modern Australian light meals."

Some notable artworks and sculptures throughout and generally not too crowded. Often changing and also free short term exhibits. Both the cafe and more upmarket restaurant are commendable options for lunch with the cafe also good for coffee and snacks.

There is a fee for this exhibition, however everything else is free to view. The gallery is not very big, but they creatively pack many exhibits into the spaces. I really liked how the artworks were presented - some hanging from the roof in the foyer, to a large installation of mirrors you can view whilst going down the stairs, to Jitish Kallat's Public notice 2 in the Entrance Court (http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/jitish-kallat/). The exhibition named Colourwheel (http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/colourwheel/ ) was another one of my favourites. There are places for the public to make their own artworks, inspired by ones currently on display. This is fantastic - making art next to masterpieces! Their online resources are also wonderful. The coffee shop inside the gallery makes great coffees and it is a nice way to finish the visit."

A hard job for the judges. And, as usual, even picking one for the People's Choice was difficult. Some portraits didn't press our buttons, but that's only personal choice. Likewise the Wynn and Sulman- some brilliance, some not appealing at all. But ALWAYS, a fantastic exposure to so many different styles in portraiture, landscapes and genre painting. Shouldn't be missed! And the Junior Archies-childrens' portrait painting etc- charming and amazingly good ! And the Members Lounge a haven on what was an incredibly busy day. Fantastic to see so many people appreciating art. Who said Australia is a cultural wasteland? Exhilarating, stimulating and inspiring."

If you do pay for an exhibition the audio tour guide is worth the expense or tag onto a guided tour free with admission at set times. Food court tends to be very busy and a bit pricey for what it is.

I was able to store my luggage in the cloakroom and also have an excellent lunch at the one of 2 cafe/restaurants in the gallery.The collection is well spaced out and themed, and I did a free guided tour of Australian Art at 2pm which was very informative. Definitely go and see the Matisse and other Impressionist art which is on display free during May/June. It was a real treat to see and read the information. There is also an exhibition of Australian Photography at the moment.It is a good 10 minute walk from St James Railway station so you need a map to get you started as when you come out of the station it is unclear in which direction to go. I walked towards the park (Hyde Park) and saw the sign to the Art Gallery which is in another large park called the Domain. You can come and go freely as entrance to Gallery is free so I took a break and had a cup of tea in the Domain and sat in the sun for a while before going back inside the gallery.I also brought my mother here last year and there are wheelchairs you can borrow for free. Plenty of lifts and good bathroom facilities. There are 2 cafe/restaurants but I would recommend the cafe as the food is cheaper and you get larger serves. The restaurant's menu has a few light meals but they are quite small. I had the cured salmon trout which was delicious but without any salad with it, I found it too rich to eat on its own and there wasn't that much anyway. I have eaten in the other cafe and there was more choice for lighter meals."

Lunch in the main restaurant (new, and looks great!) is a little extravagance, but has a terrific view. Free to get into the Gallery, so factor that into a good meal!"

Fees apply to some major temporary exhibitions but otherwise this is one of the best free sources of indoor entertainment and education in the city and worth visiting whatever the weather. It is worth noting however that the gallery opens late on Wednesdays to 10.00pm.There is so much to see, and the facilities are very good. I am interested in the settlement period but the collection encompasses aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art, contemporary, European and Asian art."

This free gallery has many highlights, though the permanent collection itself is perhaps not one of them - the Sidney Nolan collection, smaller than I expected was my main reason to visit and there are some excellent and representative works by him and the other Angry Penguins. Good Aboriginal works too, especially the sculptural pieces. There was a superb temporary exhibition of Australian photography on when I visited, and the Asian collection has some wonderful objects, interestingly interspersed with contemporary responses. The building itself is fantastic with an open and airy feel, though the new galleries do seem to go on and on rather relentlessly - by the time you get to the lowest basement there seem to be more staff than visitors around. The restaurant looked great, though I didn't try it. Located close to the Botanic Gardens (but bizarrely signposted) so a great end point to a stroll from the harbour, though as elsewhere in Sydney, the disastrous land-based public transport system makes moving on (in the rain) inconvenient."

The guides and staff are really friendly and helpful. They have a lot of information that they are happy to pass on. I really liked that there were free activities for kids of all ages to do. They were even able to take home some of their creations and continue some of their artworks at home. I thought that this was a great way of engaging the next generation in art.

My second visit was as part of a social group, where we enjoyed a wine and snacks before watching one of the free films regularly on offer at the art gallery.

Most importantly, is that they had a wonderful floor that featured various exhibits by Aboriginal artists, some historical and some contemporary. They also had good info on the displays as well as a nice film featuring many of the artists. The museum also has a wealth of other pieces, from Francis Bacon to VanGogh. The Lucien Freud painting that features Leigh Bowery is incredible, and there are many other pieces of historical importance, many of which we had discovered for the first time. They also had a temporary exhibit that incorporated ancient asian pieces along with contemporary artists like Ai Wei Wei and Nam June Paik. It was very well done, and it wasn't crowded. It was a perfect evening as we strolled through the botanical gardens to get there."

A better development of themes and enlargement of smaller images would have been preferred by me (put the original photo to one side of the enlargement, if necessary).

From Circular Quay we walk past the Opera House, through the Botanic Gardens, around Mrs Macquarie's Chair and into the gallery. For no cost you can browse the free collections housed in an open, light, sandstone building with wonderful views from large floor to ceiling windows on the entrance level. There is a restaurant on this level which is pricey, but well worth a special treat ! The cafe downstairs has a terrace and inside seating and for the cost of a very good coffee you can enjoy the ambience and views in comfort. The gallery contains paintings and sculptures from the early colonial times through to the 1960s and 1970s and some contemporary paintings. There are also Asian art galleries that are free to enter. Exhibitions change regularly and most times we attempt to go as they are uniformly good. Sometimes they are 'block-busters' and there are queues to get in, but last weekend we went and there was an excellent Australian photography exhibition which was well attended with lots of knowledgeable photography buffs. There is parking along the roads leading to Mrs Macquarie's Chair, with meters. Be careful they are patrolled frequently! However with the lovely gardens right across the road I'd encourage you to walk if you're able, and make a good day of it with a picnic in the Botanic Gardens."

Note that there is an exit from the Garden located near this attraction. This FREE Art Gallery has several floors of exhibits. The Ground Floor has beautiful paintings and art works on display. Located outside this area is the Cafe where one can buy refreshments and snacks.One floor down is the gallery where Asian arts are on display such as paintings,wall hangings, potteries/ceramics, Japanese walls, kimonos and samurais, sculptures, pictures of Jesus Christ and Buddha, etc. Another floor below the Asian Arts Exhibits is the Yaribana Gallery where art works of the aborigines are available for one's appreciation. They include wall hangings made of cloths, poles with paintings, etc.Tips: After visiting the arts on display, take a break at the Cafe. Enjoy their delicious refreshments and foods as well as the views outside of the Cafe Area. Remember to retrieve your backpack and big items (left near the entrance for temporary safekeeping) before leaving this attraction."

We specifically went to the Art Gallery of NSW to see thePhtograph and Australia exhibition, which we found very interesting.It was well set up, with a huge variety of styles and artists represented. Particularly interesting to me was the very early photographs from the 1800's.We also had a wander around the free sections of the Gallery, and the Asian arts were beautiful, and worth a look, as were the main rooms to the right of the entrance.We spent a couple of hours there in total which was more than enough time.A criticism I do have (which is quite minor) is that the placards describing the art were such small writing, you had to stand so close to them to read them, no one else could read them at the same time."

We enjoyed the indigenous Australian section, and the Asian art, but neither area was very big. The European and other Australian art I thought was not particularly exciting, and a whole floor was closed for renovation. Maybe our experience at the cafe at the start of the visit put us in a bad mood. Having waited 20 minutes for them to deliver two cups of coffee I went up to the counter and asked the staff member to make my coffee so I could take it back to the table myself. The waiters were wasting so much time wandering around looking for the table numbers. To cap it all, the ladies toilet floors were filthy and covered with pieces of toilet paper. All rather off-putting I'm afraid."

As a Yorkshireman, I am very pleased to say that entrance is FREE (certain special exhibitions excepted). The internal space was enormous and we never felt that anyone encroached on our space as we perused the art.The exhibitions that were available, Asian, European, Australian (settler) and Australian (indigenous) were very enjoyable. However, we have seen better displays of indigenous art at other Australian museums. We do not believe that the gallery has any very famous works, although it does have works by famous artists. The most noticeable piece in the European section was an enormous canvas of a French Napoleonic cavalry charge, although the central figure brandished an impossibly-shaped sabre. We noticed that many of the acquisitions of the art gallery were obtained a very long time ago. Perhaps this harks back to some previous Golden Age when the art gallery was awash with money.This review is entitled \"A Tentative Appraisal\" due to the fact that so many areas and floors of the gallery were closed for refurbishment. It felt that only around half to two thirds was actually open. Thus, although we score this establishment as \"Very Good\" we are only really assessing a part of its potential."

Have a coffee and snack then off we go. Reasonably happy.We were simply delighted to find a week ago that they have significantly redone this whole area, and pulled out of storage a plethora of amazing works (both paintings and sculptures) that we had never seen before. Some of these had plagues indicating they had been bought around 1880 and I swear I have never seen them out on show!Well laid out, simply fascinating.Our heads were full after walking around this area, and could not do another section - quite frankly, we did not want 'the buzz' to be diluted, so we had our usual coffee and left; but very pleased this time.If you have not seen this latest set-up, you simply MUST go."

The AGNSW is one of Australia's premier galleries and houses many works by both Australian and international artists.The gallery includes both a permanent collection of artwork and temporary exhibitions (generally of well-known international artists). The period of work housed includes everything from Renaissance to the Contemporary. Largely purpose built as an art gallery, the building itself is light and airy and provides a wonderful space to exhibit the works (especially when you compare it to many European galleries that have been converted from other uses and struggle with dim narrow spaces and very limited opportunity for use of natural light. The gallery sits within the Domain parkland and the two restaurant spaces have spectacular views of the harbour through floor-to-ceiling windows. A particular highlight for me was the Brett Whitely works."

Located next to The Domain park, next to the Botanical Gardens and combines well with a walk through the gardens and visit to the Sydney Opera House. Has a good cafe/bar for a bite to eat. If you are in Sydney on a Wednesday evening they are open later for Art After Hours and on these evenings as well as Sundays they usually have free screenings of films which are themed to current temporary exhibitions. Check their website for details."

The 19th century collection was fabulous being especially strong in Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and Charles Conder. Unfortunately for me the 20th century Australian works were not on view, and won't be for another three months, due to large refurbishment of the building. Instead I spent some time looking at their fine selection of art books and bought one on the modern Sydney artists. Had the modern Australian paintings been on view this great gallery would no doubt merit a five star rating."

Again, not disappointed on seeing the current collection on pop art, which is the largest I've come across anywhere in the world (52 countries, that is). Artists both internationally well known and local/NZ talent make it a true representative show, with over 200 exhibits. As to others' comments, a) this particular show is not free (the permanent halls are) and b) this one has a terrific kids' section where they can both play and experiment with creating pop art for themselves. Deserves every praise!"

I also find it unusual that an Art Gallery this size does not have a hands-on activity area for kids. Most regional art galleries have an interactive area for children to draw/create/engage. I asked at the information desk, and was told by the lady that there was nothing at all for children. Disappointed. You can, however, take photos inside. Entry is free.

You can become a member of the Gallery, and there is an area set aside downstairs with a library and cups of tea etc. for members. My last visit to the Gallery was during the Corroborree Festival in Sydney,where there was an enjoyable full program of interesting guided tours around some of the indigenous gallery, and artist talks. The cafe at the gallery has a nice atmosphere out on the verandah and quite a buzz inside, but I prefer to go elsewhere after some very ordinary experiences there recently."

You might hate Warhol, I might love his work. Neither of us, I'm sure, would claim to be 'right'.What is probably less subjective is the way a gallery's run. So, if you turn up to what is supposed to be the premier art gallery in a country's largest and most visited city and the 'current' brochure lists twelve highlights and exhibitions, of which only three are open, you start to ask questions...You would have thought that the gallery's curators would be overrun with artists enthusiastic to design up to date guides, but maybe that's just too hard and not 'arty' enough for them to tap into? I couldn't possibly know, but when the printed materials accompanying Kay Rosen's wall pieces include amazingly vacuous lines such as: \u201cbefore you created this work, I don't think anyone had noticed that the word blurred has two colours in it \u2013 'blue' at the start and 'red' at the end. And certainly no-one had blurred those two colours on the wall to make the 'r' in the middle purple ...\u201dyou really start to wonder...For more joyous nonsense and a good laugh visit this gallery. If you want to look at some less pretentious and much more (in my humble opinion only, of course...) interesting pieces visit the State library instead where there's not only beautiful architecture, up to date guides, and a complete absence of celebrity artists but, more often than not, some wonderful, thought provoking and original work on display."

The first was to take in the general exhibitions and to also stumble upon a free music concert with a brother and sister playing the harp and piccolo/flute....so enjoyable. The following fortnight was to attend the new exhibition of POP ART (charge for this but well worth it). This is on until March 2015 so well worth the time. We also returned to enjoy another concert of 3 young ladies playing woodwind instruments. These concerts are free and you will certainly be entertained and enthralled. Enjoy yourselves, we certainly did."

We try to visit this wonderful gallery several times a year, usually for the special exhibitions, because we don't live in Sydney,and it gives us a good excuse to visit the \"big smoke\". This time it was the \"Pop to Popism\"- a fascinating look at some of the very different art of the 60's to 80's- Warhol, Lichtenstein etc. Brilliant! But the permanent galleries are also a must see, with a wide range of styles, periods and genres. Anybody who wants to see 19th century Australian art should make this gallery a must see! The Indigenous and Asian art galleries are also amazing! A good cafe and shop with wide range of merchandise make it a compulsory place for all art lovers to visit!"

I just went for an enjoyable walk around the gallery and got to see some incredible modern art some graffiti pieces and some controversial stuff too. It was the third Sunday of the month so there were Art teachers supplying pencil and paper chairs and boards and giving tips and pointers on how to sketch or improve your drawing technique as we sketched the sculptures in the gallery. I stayed until it closed. The POP-ART gallery was also there at the time, its a little pricey so I decided I should go and look at that another time instead of rushing through it and missing out on the free art lesson. :)"

Then after a delicious soda in the cafe, we toured the rest of the gallery. The general collection included two Freuds & 5 Bacons, Gormley & Moore (my UKcentric comfort zone) and some really interesting 19th century Australian artists - including a lot of fabulous women artists. The Asian section was also fascinating - sitting ancient & modern side by side, including works by Kapoor & Ai Weiwei. We spent the whole afternoon here, and thoroughly recommend it."

However it is possible to spend a whole day at the Gallery by balancing the looking at art with wining and dining at the cafes or restaurants, or simply staring out picture windows and enjoying the view. The exhibitions are constantly changing and so there is always an array of art works which are Australian, American, European, Asian, and African. Some are historical and some are contemporary, so depending on my interest on any particular day there is always something I will enjoy looking at."

There's always a new exhibition. And if I don't fancy seeing the latest one then there are all my old favourites in the permanent collection to say hello to. The Gallery's shop is good, and so are the temporary shops that pop up alongside special exhibits. The canteen-style restaurant on the lowest level is busy whenever I visit and I don't like it greatly, but since it's on-site I usually end up there. The Gallery's volunteers do fine work and deserve visitors' appreciation."

I expected to see a huge selection of over-sized, extraordinary entries but the number of items on display was quite limited. Also on display was a Japanese collection of kimonos, artworks, masks, etc. Excellent.I had time for a quick stroll through the permanent galleries. Lots of old masterpieces, sculptures, etc. The Art Gallery is situated on the edge of the The Domain, a huge park extending down to the Harbour edge. I took a taxi to and from the Gallery but if you have time, why not walk through Hyde Park, to the Doman and to the Art Gallery. I paid $15 to see the Archibald and Japanese exhibitions. All other levels of the gallery offered free entry. A good way to spend a few hours."

As usual , an amazing diversity in presentation of portraiture, landscape etc. Always an absolute pleasure to see. And the Young Archies-portraits by artists aged 5 to 16 was also amazing. The gallery is a magnificent place to explore. In many visits, we still haven't seen all it has to offer, as the special exhibitions are so overwhelmingly good in themselves, but the magnificent 19th century Aussie art( Streeton, Roberts et al) is a stand out, and the huge range of genres, from traditional Asian and Indigenous art to the most abstract of modern art, with many great masters, makes the gallery what we consider to be one of the most important sites for visitors to Sydney. Don't miss it if you love and appreciate art!"

This gallery has done wonders in making the art accessible and its not unusual to see people walk right up to the paintings, all but breathing on them! This is Art up close and personal. Sydney's Archibald exhibition in July / Aug each year is an incredibly creative representation of contemporary Australian art. The Archibald is a 'must see'. Given its location on the border of the Domain and near the beautiful Sydney harbour, tourists would do well to head to the gallery in the midst of a day walk through the Botanical Gardens and Sydney harbour"

A nice, walkable distance from the Rocks and coming upon this beautiful, majestic building as we emerged from the park made the experience even more engaging. Wonderfully laid out, the rooms large enough to impress but small enough not to be overwhelming and the stories and explanations beside the pieces being very informative, this Gallery rated a second visit three months later upon our preparation for departure. The pre-Raphaelites were an absolute thrill to see. It was also my introduction to Australian artist Sydney Long, whose work I fell in love with.We returned the next day to take in the temporary exhibit, \"America, Painting a Nation,\" which was an enjoyable, if brief, overview of American art with the usual suspects; Copley, Hopper, Whistler, etc. The gallery shop was excellent, however we found the caf\u00e9 to be quite mediocre, with possibly the worst cheesecake I've ever had in my life. Gave the caf\u00e9 a second chance upon our return visit and was equally disappointed. Then again, I don't go to museums for cheesecake.Professional photos 181 traveler photosEnter dates for best pricesCheck Inmm/dd/yyyyCheck Outmm/dd/yyyy83% Ranked #78 of 284 Barcelona B&B and Inns636 Reviews Certificate of Excellence 2013A recent review\u201cGreat hotel in Barcelona\u201dreviewed 4 weeks agoSim132 Basel"

A stunning location, a stately and beautiful building, amazing exhibits all year round and a loyal clientele of Australians and visitors every day of the year. There's also a fine gallery shop. We were there to see this year's entries for the Archibald Prize for portrait painting and were not disappointed. 54 varied and evocative portraits in every imaginable style, with helpful comments on each one. The entries for the Wynne Prize for landscape painting of figurative sculpture were also worth a look but, with few exceptions, were rather less impressive. Stephen Pong's 'Broken Well' was a highlight and great fun, however. The Sulman Prize entries were, as always, unsettling, fascinating and full of imagination - this prize really encourages fresh creativity.We found the Lost Prince and the Winter Queen exhibition from London's National Portrait Gallery educational and well worth a visit, as was the Plumes and Pearlshells exhibition on the art of the New Guinea highlands - comprehensive and fascinating. By this time, we had reached sensory overload, which is often the case in this wonderful gallery. But we'll be back soon!"

I wasn't disappointed. The gallery is perched on the edge of the Domain in a fabulous position overlooking Woolloomooloo and Sydney Harbour and so a joy to visit because of its prime location. The Archibald paintings were well displayed and even though it was busy, we were able to take our time and look at all the paintings at our leisure. The 2014 winner was unusual but a worthy choice. We didn't have a lot of time to spare and so didn't get a chance to visit the many of the other galleries/rooms almost all of which are free.

The tour guide was very nice but she seemed not to have the greatest grasp on the material she was presenting. I particularly liked the more modern Australian art - but I like modern art in general. The presentation on early 1900s paintings and their context in Australian history was quite nice.I must admit that my husband and I were suffering from jet lag as we had just arrived in Australia. This colored my experience of the museum and I probably didn't get as much out of the visit as I could have. I'd definitely recommend visiting the museum if you have time but it wouldn't be high on my list if my time was limited."

The Australians state\u2019s flagship art gallery boasts an impressive collection of Australian and International Art. Did I mention it was free? \uf04a It did charge a $10 fee for the special exhibit on Afganistan Hidden Treasures (which I paid and could have probably skipped). After inquiring at the front desk and being helped by a very friendly young man, I was able to download an application that allowed me to be pointed to the highlights as described by the Museum\u2019s director. Each piece had a audio file that could be listened to while examining the painting/object, etc. I find that this is a very good way for someone like me who really enjoys/appreciates art but does not have any training in what to look at/for to get a much deeper appreciation of the piece. It needs to be updated a little (some of the noted paintings did not have a current audio file and perhaps a little more work on the layout of the audio portions) - I was absorbed in the Museum for the better part of two hours, and allowed me to get off my feet at times to sit down and listen to the review. It is obvious why so many Australians are so proud of their Museums. Good facilities, good price. Very good experience."

Sydney can be a bit of a cultural wasteland. Thankfully, the NSW Art Gallery is one oasis in the cultural desert. The collection of works on display is quite large and covers major local and international art movements. If you come expecting the Tate or the Guggenheim you will, however, be sorely disappointed - keep some perspective!!I would especially recommend a visit for those trying to develop a better understanding of Indigenous art. The works on display are breathtaking in their use of form & colour. It is significant to note that the works display Indigenous art as a living and progressive movement; not something to be assigned to history books. Those seeking to explore the roots of Western culture in Australia will not be disappointed. Numerous oils grace the walls that trace the artistic journey made by the first Europeans as they endeavored to interpret this harsh and forbidding environment. You see before your eyes the shift from a European perspective to a new \"Australian\" perspective where the light and colour of the landscape are portrayed more realistically. Where the \"English\" perspective has given way to the perspective of the 'new' Australians. In addition the collection of Pre-Raphaelite works is of a quality rarely found outside of Europe. The Modernist movement is well represented too, with works by Roy de Maistre, Grace Cossington Smith and Margaret Preston. And on and on it goes.In its parkland setting the NSW Art Gallery is a wonderful insight into some of the best of Australian art. By the way, like all good art galleries, the cafe is predictably ordinary. I do however recommend the High Tea in the restaurant. A great way to spend an afternoon or, for the art tragic, a couple of days!!"

The layout is open and 'airy' and it does make it easier to appreciate the art. A fairly diverse range of art that found interesting (even if 'grazed' a tad in certain areas).There seems to be a reasonable cycle of ongoing events and the kids enjoyed being involved in a didgeridoo/aboriginal music event where they learned about the history/background of the didgeridoo/got involved/made music etc. They all thoroughly enjoyed it.For myself, the highlight was the three 'museum guards' performing Tino Sehgal's \"This is so Contemporary\" in the entrance foyer on unsuspecting visitors. It was absolutely fabulous and whilst maybe would be considered a little 'on the fringes' was incredibly interesting art. Seriously it made my day. Whilst this event may have now ended, I am sure that such an open-minded gallery would have other equally as interesting activities.Normally, after a couple of hours in an art gallery/museum I am chomping at the bit to escape.

She started with the19th century landscapes of the new continent, by the Europeans reflecting the romantic style of the day. She took us through the aborigine works explaining the deeper meanings of what looks like modern \"dot\" art as well as the carved and painted funerial posts. And she was equally enthusiastic about the modern art, pointing out the installation of river rocks suspended in an array of cables, casting interesting shadows.

Just as jaw dropping, however, is the setting and we managed to visit on one of those blue, sparkly Sydney Summer days so the views from the windows were sometimes a distraction from the artwork. The food outlets are dependable and the facilities are fine, especially considering there is no charge for general entry. Special exhibitions will usually have an entry fee. Definitely worth a visit but do allow time to wander around the Royal Botanic Gardens and take in the view from Mrs Macquarie's Chair while you are in the area."

During our visits there was a special exhibition of American art and a collection of crayon drawings made by Aboriginal elders in 1947. The classic exterior of the gallery opens into a spacious, open, and easy to navigate interior with both a cafe and a restaurant with lovely views and a children's area for hands-on activities.

The Gallery itself is impressively spacious and we were able to enjoy the permanent collection without charge. On an early summer Sunday the place was nicely buzzing with visitors enjoying all the exhibits and it created a very good ambience. There are additional specialised visiting exhibitions that change on a regular basis. Added to all this is a superb cafe with, on the Sunday, live music. The staff at the Gallery reception were very welcoming and we could not believe the efficiency of the Cafe team."

Such a civilised gallery. It was full of visitors but neither crowded nor noisy and all seemed absorbed and entertained. Link between art and nation-building intelligently explained but surely more contrast between early and later periods could have been made? Absence of anything from the early period a disappointment.The cafe is as good as ever; not cheap but food is sustaining and pleasant variety available. Service excellent.After that, sufficiently restored to visit the splendid Australian art upstairs. The Russell Drysdale collection is amazing.Only disappointment was the Gift Shop. Postcard images tiny and poorly reproduced so the Drysdales, McCubbins et al will have to be remembered rather than continue to be enjoyed. Even the range of small prints was very narrow. Most other galleries of this size and reputation do far better."

Once you walk through the neo-classical entrance, you are inside a truly modern gallery. The European collection is interesting, but it is the extensive collection of Australian art that makes this gallery a stand out. The Indigenous art exhibition is amazing! I think the best aspect of the gallery's collection is its eclectic nature. You will see works from all over Asia and this helps to contextualise the modern Australian art as well as that by those original Australians whse ancestors have been making representations of the world for over 40 000 years. Visiting this gallery is an emotional and intellectual experience that, for any visitor to Sydney who wishes to understand the essence of Australian artistic thought, is an absolute must."

We've got a lot of galleries, public and private, and other cultural institutions, such as our national broadcaster, ABC Radio National and other affiliates.But, back to AGNSW, as most of us know it.Have a look around the top of the building before you enter. You will see the names of those artists considered \"the best\" in the 19th century, when the institution was built. Some you will know and others have faded into obscurity.The collection has some of the classics, but also newer works.Of interest to visitor and resident alike are the changing exhibitions of various sorts and sizes.One perennial is the art works of the New South Wales high school finishing examination. Here you can see the artists of the future.For other shows, either check the paper or the AGNSW website."

It did not have the stuffy feel of a museum, there was something going on most of the time, we were inspired. It is a complete contrast to the fabulous Botanic gardens which are literally opposite. If you spent one whole day in the gardens and the Gallery, with perhaps a walk around the Opera house as well, you would have a very memorable day. You would also be completley worn out !"

Wow!Imagine standing amongst room after room of hallowed canvases, biographical materials, including his ripped up photographs, seeing his foci and style shift as he moved through different phases and relationships of his life.It was too much to absorb in a single visit and we were lured back a second time to simply absorb more.The exhibition was highly moving and his life experiences were exposed via his paintings as if under a microscope; revealing the confinement of post war England and calling upon the world to reflect and change!Well, even if you missed Bacon I can only egg you on to enjoy The Gallery of NSW's fine collection of indigenous art, the wonderful Australian Impressionists, Geoffery Smart's shrunken portrait of Clive James. Margaret Preston's woodblocks, portraits of and paintings by Margaret Olly and much, much, much more.I'd recommend setting aside a day or two, if you love art and have not been there before!"

Particular artists that impressed were Stratton, Lambert and Pingouet of the 19th century in NSW.

A great spot to take visitors, or just to meet a friend for a coffee or lunch."

There are a great number of museums and galleries in Sydney, but the Art Gallery tops my list of favorites for its vast collections of Asian and European art, sculptures, contemporary items, and always lively ambience. It was late in the afternoon the day I went, and I was much enchanted by the live jazz performance at the museum cafe, with the harbor as the backdrop. Would definitely come again."

Walking through the Botanical Gardens was a lovely prelude to our visit. The gallery is spacious, bright and quite impressive. The permanent collection was so interesting with many pieces by well known Australian artists set out in time periods. The Korean porcelain display was thought provoking and the Korean prints delightful. The Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes were amazing exhibitions and to see these pieces in situ was a terrific experience. The highlight was discovering the Gallery has an After Hours program on a Wednesday night. The Gallery is open to the public with the restaurant open and access to all exhibitions available. A three piece Jazz Trio was performing for diners creating a friendly warm atmosphere. To top it off, the After Hours program was the free, just turn up and join in art classes run by the Education Officers. We spent 2 hours in the 19th century gallery drawing statues and pieces from pictures with over the shoulder tuition from the well qualified, supportive instructors. What a great initiative by the gallery providing us with a remarkable unplanned experience."

It is a fantastic collection, with an excellent range of art styles, to suit all interests. However, our main gripe from our last visit was the Archibald Prize showing. For these really popular shows, I think the gallery should consider 'timed' tickets as you get at other venues - when we visited the gallery was so packed, we could hardly see any of the pictures and certainly had no quiet time to stand, observe and contemplate the art. Also, the description cards by each picture were so small and in such tiny font, that people were having to crowd around them to read, thus blocking the paintings even more. Our other issue that day (a school day !) was the huge crowds of school children - it was packed with pre-schoolers up to older teenagers (is it some sort of Aussie School art appreciation day?) - while I fully support children being exposed to art at an early age, the main galleries were also packed and extremely noisy - definitely not my idea of the ideal environment for art appreciation ! Perhaps the schools should be given a day to themselves once a month, when the gallery is shut to the public. We came away feeling pretty disappointed this time. However, on a positive note, this is truly a lovely gallery in a beautiful setting, and should be on any visitors itinerary."

The dramaturg or artist provocateur kept calling these aged art attack terrorists into a huddle to redirect their performance.

I also think they should have said 'contemporary' if they were going to do he activity.I enjoyed most of the gallery which is huge and very attractive. I found the Pre Raphealite section most impressive and was surprised to see so many Bacons there. The one Picasso in the collection was pretty unpleasant sadly and doesn't hold a candle to most of the Picasso's in MOMA.Some of the exhibits in the modern exhibitions were repulsive e.g. The tiny naked shrivelled old women, and others creepy and horrible like the dead clowns.

Reminiscent of Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park, London, they had lots to say about almost everything."

Aside from the special exhibition (which depending on your tastes may be well worth the ticket price) entry is free. And there's plenty to look at, from aboriginal art to old masters and much more besides - including some very contemporary works. But if you can, visit mid week. Not only is it late night opening there are likely to be extra attractions going on too. We stumbled upon live music in the cafe, a curator's tour and a discussion forum. The whole building is a bit of a tardis and first impressions from the outside can be misleading as there's lots is space to easily swallow up the hoards of visitors."

We spent four and a half focused hours at this museum (not including the satisfying scones and clotted cream pick-me-up in its cafe), discovering the richness with which Australian artists responded to and at times anticipated artistic trends we had only known through U.S. and European museums. Here a set of landscapes that called to mind the Hudson Valley School; there a Monet-like village; over there, a Manet-like portrait; onto symbolism and abstractions . . . . Plus of course the scenes so emblematic of aspects of Australian life, such as the sheep-sheering. I felt like I had won the lottery in coming across this previously unknown-to-me trove of artists and works!We also were excited to view works of aboriginal art, both historic and contemporary, and found many compelling pieces. However, I will say that the legends describing aboriginal art both at the Museum of Australia (primarily a science museum) and the smaller Discovery Museum (in the Rocks area) were more detailed, helping us to understand better the context and aims of the artists and the pieces themselves. A few more words of description or explanation would have enhanced our time in these galleries of the NSW Museum. But, I have to stress that the Australian holdings (settlers and aboriginal) were so strong that we only very briefly walked through the European galleries (just to see what they contained) and never did get to the Asian ones, an omission we made sadly."

This is a must-visit for travelers and those domiciled in the Sydney area!I have visited the gallery at least 10 times, along with most of Sydney's museums and galleries. The Art Gallery of NSW is, without a doubt, my favorite. Their permanent collection is truly a treasure, a brilliant and robust display of many of the world's (arguably) finest and well-known artists, which features broad and notable displays of Impressionism, Abstraction, Contemporary and Indigenous/Aboriginal art, sculpture, Ancient and Asian art.***The special exhibition, in my opinion, is ALWAYS worth visiting. Currently, the gallery is featuring Francis Bacon's works until 23 Feb '13. Do NOT miss this, and be sure to take the free guided tour. The guides are exceptionally well-informed and will most definitely make your visit memorable with a wonderfully prepared narrative, which captures and contextualizes Bacon and his works in a unique light.***General admin. is free. Special exhibition is $20 for adults, $10 for children, and ***2-for-1 tix are avail 1 night only on 13 Feb from 5-9PM.*** Parking is easy. The Botanic Gardens are across the way from the gallery, with the CBD, Circular Quay, Opera House, many other points of interest, hotels and restaurants shortly beyond that.

Car Parking is available in the Domain underground car park for a reasonable set fee on a weekend and it will save you having to move the car around or try and find street parking in the Domain itself. The Gallery itself features multiple levels of exhibitions within a complex that embraces both postmodern and classical/gothic architectural surrounds and carries a wide range of art in its various forms. Regular collections on display incorporate painting, multimedia, sculpture, digital and a wide range of Asian and Indigenous art. Entry is free. Touring Exhibitions are a highlight, a personal fave being 2011's Manga exhibition. The annual HSC art exhibit - Art Escape - is also very worthwhile and is run in the first quarter of each new year. Most of the touring exhibitions attract an additional fee however it is usually reasonable given the cost of other art galleries globally and if you are a regular attendee, becoming a member of the Gallery will give you discounted tickets as well as access to free exhibitions. The Art Gallery's shop is comprehensive is providing a selection of prints and art resources as well as popular culture items so souvenir buying is not an issue. The cafe is also reasonable in offering a range of hot and cold items from hearty lunches to snacks and sweets. The Gallery also offers a range of workshops for budding artists and you'll find that there are often talka and musical performances on offer from students of the local Conservatorium and Australian Institute of Music to accompany select openings and exhibitions. In summry, the Art Gallery of NSW is definitely worth a visit whether it be to view a Gaugin, a Picasso or a Warhol. Lovers of edgy, contemporary sculpture will embrace many of the exhibits while lovers of colonial and classic art will find more than enough to entrance them."

Before arriving in Sydney, we were recommended to walk along the harbor, through the Royal Botanical Gardens, and visit the museum, and we spent a lovely morning doing just that! Anyone can view the permanent collection free of charge, but the special exhibits cost about $20. We were lucky enough to happen upon a curator talk of the Bacon exhibit that took guests through the works for about an hour. My husband is not very interested in art but stayed engaged in the talk-- it was really a treat. It would be worth looking at the website before a visit to see if you could benefit from the museum's educational programs."

Its collection is enthralling, with European, White and Aboriginal Australian work all well hung and displayed. I am always fascinated by the light the paintings shed on the history of the early settlers, and by the depictions of native flora and fauna. The gallery is right opposite the gate to the Botanic gardens so if you travel by train to St James you can walk down through the Domain, look round the gallery, walk through the Botanic Gardens and come out to the Opera House and Circular Quay. It's a very satisfying way to spend a day, or half a day if your time is limited. There is no admission fee either to the gallery or the gardens."

It is reasonably priced and has very interesting pieces that you won't find anywhere else. The special exhibits that are brought in are always fabulously curated and well worth the price of the ticket.

It takes 10 mins to walk through the Domain from the CBD. In Summer the gallery stays open late at least 1 night a week so check the website. A decent gallery experience will take you between 2 and 3 hours depending on whether you also do one of the optional special exhibitions (of which there are usually 2 on concurrently) at a cost (well worth it). The gallery space is approx twice the size of SF's Legion of Honour Museum, and includes an excellent modern extension housing a good affordable restaurant with a north facing outdoor terrace offering harbour views and an enormous historic Moreton Bay Fig tree. I am Australian who takes Art holidays o/s and I am very proud of our AGNSW. It is unpretentious so don't be afraid of showing up \"looking like a tourist with a back pack\" as you can cloak your bags for free. The collection of contemporary Australian big name artists is extensive and impressive, and there is an equally worthy collection of international art (modern and period). The gift shop may be a bit of a dissapointment to those used to stores like the de young but that's a small criticism. Check out what is happenning in the Domain and the Botanical Gardens before you arrive so you can maximise your day, or walk a little further north past the entrance and turn right to take the stairs to the excellent bars and restauarants on the waterfront at the Woolloomoolloo Finger Wharf. This area is very safe for travellers."

Best as of now the magnificient Atget photo exhibition. Love Paris, delight in amazing photography? If so this exhibition is a must. Relatively small and simple but what an amazing collection. It probably won't come to Australia again soon . It is an inspiration for aspiring photographers and anyone thinking of visiting Paris. Afterwards just wander down through the gardens to the harbour, on to the Opera house and if you are there on Saturday onto the Rock's market. If you are hardened you can even head on to the Gallery of Modern Art which is also glorious. But don't miss taking a breath to enjoy the harbour, bridge, gardens and the opera house. Lucky you, picture taking heaven. Loads of places to stop and eat or drink or just sit and revel in the visual magnificence."

While there are some magnificent works housed there, none more so than the works of the early Australian artists... Condor, Streeton, Preston, Cossington Smith ET al, the lighting left a lot to be desired and did not do the paintings justice.Come on Sydney, you need to lift your game! Not only that but could do with some obvious shuttle transport fom railway station to the Gallery as is quite a walk from Town Hall on a hot day.Lunch at the cafe was also awful... the smoked salmon sandwich with so little filling and mostly bread....comprising a few lettuce leaves and a miniscule slice of salmon on heavy black rye bread cut so thick and so chewy and smeared with some tasteless dressing, it was impossible to eat, to be whed down with a bottled version of lemon lime and bitters so sickly sweet it resembled nothing like lemon lime and bitters!

Did I mention the tour AND the entrance is free?!?!The Highlights tour was great, I wouldn't have known where to start on my own. Wendy, the tour guide, showed us all the interesting pieces and I went back on my own to revisit them. I took the $10 tour of the Atget \"Old Paris\" exhibit that also has a tour a few times a week. It's a good exhibit for those interested in seeing old Paris and photos that have been developed by the photographer himself that are about 100 years old. Other than that, if you are looking for amazing composition, you may want to look elsewhere. The artist was more documentary style, with an eye for detail, but not any \"artistic\" composition. After two tours, I went back to the 15th-19th century galleries and then hit up the contemporary side. I ended up spending 10:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. at the gallery, getting a sandwich at their cafe (a bit pricey at $11 for what is served, but I needed sustenance beyond my protein bar).It is definitely worth it. And the Botanic Garden is across the way with St. Mary's Cathedral not too far off either. If you're on a budget, or if you have even a few hours to spare, go to the Art Gallery of NSW."

Although the focus is on Australian artists, it is juxtaposed with collections of works from overseas artists including regular special exhibitions of significance. For example I can remember first seeing the Tutenkhaman collection at the Cairo Museum in Egypt, then again in London, then in Sydney at this Gallery. So most of the major collections that are touring come to Sydney. Because of Australia's location in the Asia Pacific Region there is also a significant Asian collection. The Art Gallery of NSW is really a vibrant community of art works, talks, performances, workshops, video and film. You can wander at leisure, or take a guided tour. The special visiting exhibits have self guided tours with recorded commentary and rentable earphones. There are two restaurants in the Gallery, one Bistro style and the other a la carte with one of the best panoramas of Sydney Harbour. Both are licenced. Across the road is the Botanic Gardens, a very special collection reflecting introduced species from early settlement and native species. A nice combination is to visit the Gallery and have lunch there, or to visit the Gallery and then to stroll through the Gardens and find one of several kiosks or restaurants therin for lunch. Or, take a picnic. The Gallery is within easy walk of Museum metro station or the CBD. Parking is metered and not really a problem if you want to drive. There is good provision of handicapped parking spots immediately outside the gallery, which itself is wheel chair friendly. Allow 4 hours for an Art Gallery visit with lunch and a stroll in its environs."

We also witnessed some individuals standing on their own appleboxes orating on what they're passionate about on one of the paths outside the Gallery although I'm not too sure if that's a regular thing. It's always a good idea to visit the Art Gallery to spark some creative inspiration.Tip: Start your Royal Botanic Gardens expedition at this spot."

I've been to this gallery every year since my teenage years & what has prevented me from becoming a member is the fact that the gallery isn't able to properly utilise space. The centre of the gallery is so cavernous ie there's so much open space, that it hinders more works from being displayed. Why do this? There's an open area in The Louvre in Paris but that serves as a point where all the halls converge. And the AGNSW ain't The Louvre!The European & Australian masters area is wonderful, but the collection isn't as vast as that of the NGV's.Also I have been told in the past that I can't take photos of the newer (permanent) exhibits, despite the fact my camera wasn't in flash mode. And yet I can take photos with joyful abandon in various art galleries in Europe.All in all, the AGNSW is like a disappointing present: beautifully gift-wrapped but not much inside."

Scary was the old lady, that looked like a baby asleep in her bed... thatt will live with me and if you have a phobia about clowns, just be careful as there's an inflated one lying on the floor in one of the rooms if my memory serves me right..... The point was solitude..... Do pop in to the gallery very light and airy, Thr shop had some nice pieces but as a tourist coming from Ireland found it a bit expensive to purchase much.

I don't know a lot about art but a trip to this Gallery is a must when in Sydney. The location on the edge of the Harbour is superb as well. There are some lovely eating opportunities in the Gallery. On this occasion I saw a little McCubbin landscape which I have not seen before which made the trip worth it of itself. I was also thrilled to be able to have a look at the Archibald Prize submissions. Allow yourself the time to really enjoy the Gallery.Visited May 2012"

There's something for everyone at the Art Gallery, thanks in large part to former Director, Edmund Capon who, in his 33 year tenure transformed it into an accessible, sophisticated, friendly and rich repository for classic, Aboriginal & contemporary art.Locals love the Wednesday evening \"Art after Hours\", when the gallery is open until 9pm and there's an interesting talk or interview at 6:30, following a guided tour of specific works. Films, jazz and the opportunity for a snack & drink follow.http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/art-after-hours/The restaurant has an excellent menu and is the ideal place for a leisurely or business lunch. It's also a very comfortable place for the solo diner. Service is good and the views of Woolloomooloo are an edgy alternative to the picture post card \"Bridge & Opera House\" vistas.The caffeteria is larger, has a good range of food and drinks and outdoor seating at a reasonable cost.I think the ideal route to the Art Gallery of NSW is via the Botanic Gardens - or walk back in the late afternoon and catch the Opera House with a sunset background.Entry to the gallery is free, 7 days a week. The only charge is for special exhibitions, which are usually about $10 for adults. Concessions are available for children, students, Australian Seniors and pensioners.The Art Gallery of NSW is a vibrant & integral part of Sydney and although this review will date my visit as \"May 2012\", I've visited at least once a month for the last 30 years & been a member for 25 + years. Always something interesting to see, love visiting my favourites, and discovering new works.The gift shop is a treasure trove and a wonderful source of birthday, Christmas and \"just because\" gifts. Sometimes, even for others!"

Brilliant collection of local works, with some of the best pieces from Olsen, Whitely, Grace Cossington, Michael Johnson, Lloyd Rees, Streeton and Roberts. Favorite for me is Streeton's Redfern Station, but the whole place is just the most fantastic chronicle of the development of Australia's (and specifically Sydney's) personality.It's free to get in, just and easy stroll from the CBD across the park, with some great places to sit and gaze across Wooli Pier and the eastern end of the harbour. Very hard to beat as a way to spend a couple of hours.I go back every 6 months or so, and seem to enjoy it more every time. Equal fav with Musee D'Orsay."

If you can combine the two experiences yo have heaven. Anyway back to the gallery. There is the classic section and the indigenous Australian section.

I also love the fact that if you visit it on a Saturday, there are free copies of the Sydney Morning Herald (a bumper edition) that you can read in the caf\u00e9 and then take away with you. The caf\u00e9 is good, though more like a restaurant in that you can't see the food before you order it (I found myself wondering whether their sandwiches were small enough to warrant buying a cake to go with them). But that's a minor complaint; the sandwich was great.The gallery specialises, as I suppose one would expect, in 19th cent and Australian art (including an extensive collection of modern art) and I found that aspect of the gallery impressive. The least impressive collection was the display of Pacific Island Art which is tucked away in a kind of lobby at the bottom of a staircase. Maybe I was missing something, but if the half-dozen items on display represent the extent of the collection, and you want to see the art of the South Pacific, then you'd be better advised to visit the Auckland War Memorial Museum.There is a modest collection of Renaissance/Early Modern paintings, but they're well displayed and worth a look."

Not many people know about the reference library downstairs... ask at the desk about this...You can take pictures of the art (except for the Aboriginal work.)If you arrive early enough, there is meter parking in front of the gallery. Otherwise, parking is nearly always available in the loop road next to the Botanical gardens. It is metered, so a bit of walking is required if you want to stay a while. Otherwise, the other parking stations nearby are under the Cathedral (enter from the back) or \"The Domain Parking\". These both require a walk."

He dabbled in both traditional and experimented with abstract work too. My only disappointment was there were no pieces of art that involved his paintings over pottery."

If they have a big exhibition on you have to buy your tickets online so that the ticket line doesn't clog the foyer. Problem is the tickets are valid for entry for a single 30 MINUTE timeslot. I don't know about you, but if I'm enjoying a day in the city I would never set myself such a strict timeslot to be somewhere. Which of course means, you may miss you ticket entry time and either wait until much later in the day/evening or miss out on going in that day altogether.The National Gallery of Victoria and Australia both ticket at the event...you just line up and wait. I've been to the last day of exhibitions a few times in Victoria and it was manic...but I didnt wait more than 40 minutes to enter from the line and it didnt disrupt my day as I got then when I felt like it.You should defintely be able to refund or at swap to another time or day...they dont advertise this but we pursued them to give a missed timeslot ticket to go another day (because of the *cough* disgusting Sydney traffic).Rant over."

From the moment you are outside the majestic building, you will feel an air of austerity and all your cares fall behind you as you enter the gorgeous timber-doored entrance. The classically elegant Art Gallery of NSW is one of Sydney\u2019s most distinctive landmarks. The fa\u00e7ade and old wing of the Gallery were built between 1896 and 1909 and since that time there have been a number of extensions and additions. From its more permanent collection on exhibition to visiting collections (such as the recent Picasso), the gallery has something for everyone's art interest; from the extremely modern through to the classics. If you're looking for a carefree and uplifting afternoon where you can admire artworks in the genre of your choice, either solo or with friends/family, this is a wonderful place to visit. The Art Gallery shop has a wonderful collection of books, gifts, gift cards and the like for those interested in a little retail therapy when you snap out of your dream-like state after you have viewed art until your heart's content. A must for visitors to Sydney and for Sydney-siders alike! ENJOY!"

While it is something of a sprint to keep up with the crowd, which seems undiminished after 4 months, one nevertheless gets a sense of the breadth and depth of Picasso's enormous output - as well as his extraordinarily complex life. While the exhibition itself is very interesting, it is made even more enjoyable by spending a few hours comparing and contrasting his works with the balance of the gallery. If you are heading to Sydney before 25 March 2012, definitely add a visit to the AGNSW to your itinerary."

It was OK at best. If you like modern art, try MCA's one and only exhibition while under renovation/construction - we enjoyed it more than Picasso and it's free!"

For a major exhibition it was disappointing, it gave the impression that it had been rushed rather than properly planned. The paintings however were very interesting and thought provoking."

Visiting the Picasso exhibition was top of our list for a long weekend in Sydney, however it was the Dobell drawing prize that left us amazed. Attendance is free, as it was to the rest of the gallery - (other than the Picasso exhibit)-. We spent ages exploring each work. The technical skill, creativity and effort that went into many of the works was astounding. What a pity there wasn't a catalogue or book. We also enjoyed, Dragon, the Asian ceramic and other objects' exhibition in honour of the Chinese New Year.The Picasso exhibition was worth seeing for its scope, covering all of his major periods and taking ten different rooms to do so. Picasso was a seminal figure in the art world for most of the twentieth century. He was certainly one of its most prolific producers of art and no stranger to self promotion and marketing. Still I can never shake the feeling that he was completely self indulgent and just a bit reminiscent of the children's story - Emperor's New Clothes.The Art Gallery is next door to the Botanic Gardens. We travelled from Darling Harbour by water taxi and were shown Lloyd Rees and Brett Whiteley's Lavender Bay homes enroute. Disembarking at the Opera House we took a \"choo choo\" train across the gardens and alighted at stop two only two minutes from the gallery.We spent three hours there seeing the three temporary exhibits, some of the permanent collection, exploring the shop and having a sublime meal in the restaurant"

Good mixture of sculptures, paintings and audio-visual displays.I can attest to their excellent security, managing to set off a laser proximity sensor when I leaned too far forward to check out the intricate pencil work on a large abstract piece - the security guard was very friendly, realised I wasn't trying to damage anything and let me off with a gentle rebuke. Well worth a look and sure to have something to please almost everyone."

Containing over 150 drawings, paintings, sculptures and sketches imported from the Musee National du Picasso in Paris, the exhibit explores Picasso's work in chronological order from his early days through later life. There are a few well-known pieces on display. The exhibit is very popular and each room is packed with visitors. It has timed tickets so best to book online for the time you want, especially if you have limited time. For example, I arrived when the gallery opened at 10am without a pre-ordered ticket and the earliest I could get in to the exhibit was 11.30am. But there is plenty to see elsewhere in the gallery while waiting to get in. The Kaldor Collection is an interesting display of contemporary art featuring works by Christo, Jeff Koons and many more."

However, when the Musee National Picasso in Paris decided to lend major works to the Art Gallery of NSW for the summer 2011 - 2012, I decided to go along and try to get a better understanding of this artist's work. The works are well hung, but I was surprised that all the paintings are behind glass. This allowed people to get really close up and personal (though often making it difficult for others to see) but there was very little glare or reflected light getting in the way of the viewing experience. The sculptures are terrific and it was great to be able to see them from many angles. The biggest surprise of the day for me was the first room where his early work is displayed - these I could understand and his 'classical' artistic training was evident to me (who struggles with his later works). The exhibition follows a developmental timeline so the progression from his early, fairly conventional student days through his blue and rose periods to his late works charts these changes - I found this helpful.Entry to the exhibition is staggered at 30 minute intervals, and buying tickets online through Ticketek is a great option - there was still a queue to enter the actual exhibition but it moved quickly. Sydneysiders turned out in force on the day of our visit and while it would be nicer to have the gallery less crowded, it was still wonderful to see so many people of all ages enjoying the experience. Children are included, being given notebooks, pencils and a big picture to colour in, a la the painter's style.The cafeteria was busy - the quality is good, if fairly expensive. Limited parking is available at the door, or The Domain carpark would be best if a walk across grass is not a problem, There is also the 441 bus from the CBD."

It has a well thought out collection located in a number of predominately medium sized rooms and galleries. Unlike other capital city galleries, the Art Gallery of NSW isn't overwhelming in terms of size, and offers a level of intimacy that is lost in larger galleries. With this in mind, the curators do a great job at ensuring they have a well selected range and depth of artwork on display at any given point in time.Entry to the main parts of the gallery is free. Exhibitions are at a cost, but discounts are normally offered under reciprocal rights arrangements with state, national and major international art galleries.Given it's size, the whole gallery can viewed comfortable over the course of half a day. Or for a more leisurely experience, consider a morning tour and lunch at the gallery cafe followed by an afternoon visiting select wings in more detail.For kids, exhibitions tend to have child oriented activities to keep them entertained and engaged. You can also find child based podcasts available for some exhibitions on the gallery's website. Kids audio tours and gallery trails are also available. Visit the gallery's kids webpage for more info. http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/discover-art/gallery-kids/"

The Art Gallery of New South Wales has a delightful mix of works, from Renaissance European paintings to Asian religious statues to contemporary installation art. It's much larger than it looks from the front because most of the floors are underground, and admission is free (with the exception of certain special exhibits within the museum, such as the current Picasso show). I was especially impressed by the large collection of contemporary art, which occupies the largest floor; I spent about two hours in that collection alone. Best of all, because admission is free, you don't need to see it all at once, if you start to feel museum-ed out; I visited here twice in the course of a week-long visit to Sydney, spending about 4-5 hours total.You won't find too many top-tier names here, some of the better-known artists being Giacometti, Marini, and LeWitt. But the quality of the works is generally excellent, with the exception of the small exhibit of Australian aboriginal works, all of which I found rather unengaging. Toward the southeast corner of the ground floor, there's a new collection of East Asian and South Asian art; don't overlook it because the entrance to that wing isn't immediately obvious, lying beyond, and to the right of, the downward escalators. The museum has free public restrooms, and there's a cafe with a wider menu than you'd expect. There's also a small gift shop.The Art Gallery is located on a quiet road in the Domain, which is essentially the southern extension of the Royal Botanic Gardens. You'll immediately recognize the Gallery because its pillared facade and neoclassical look are typical of art museums everywhere; moreover, the frieze around the museum bears the names of many artists, mostly famous but some forgotten. In the immediate vicinity of the Art Gallery you'll also find a charming statue of the poet Robert Burns, as well as the memorial to New South Wales police officers killed in the line of duty. The nearest train station is St. James, located about 8 minutes' walk southwest of the museum."

We duly had a delightfully unhindered two hours enjoying the extraordinary works on show then headed for the restaurant. However, when the waiter handed us the menu (which had been published on the website) Tikatek diners were offered an entree (we three did not like any of those offered) and a main with dessert being an added $15. I stated firmly that this was not what we had paid for and the waiter, whilst telling us that it was not his rule, agreed that we should be provided with the published courses.

Simply amazing."

            "review": "Great new exhibition areas. Since I last visited the gallery, there have been new exhibition areas added to accommodate the John Kaldor collection of contemporary art. This has some stunning and thought-provoking work from a range of international and Australian artists. This collection was the highlight of my visit.There was also an exhibition of German expressionist work, which I enjoyed, but was quite expensive to see at $20. I felt some of the works were crowded together which didn't allow for the best viewing experience. With the gallery shop right outside, I wondered if this was intended to be more of a money maker for the gallery than a cultural event.I had a look at some of the recent acquisitions in the Asian art collection, and enjoyed this, although I'm not very familiar with this sort of art."

This new collection has been donated by John Kaldor and is an interesting and eclectic mix of contemporary art from his private collection over the past few decades.Some of the art is brilliant, some is really interesting to sit and ponder and some is not as approachable. But overall it is a fantastic addition to the galleries collections. And if you can view it with a gallery volunteer guide, then it makes it even better."

            "review": "Perfect Size. As I was in Sydney during their winter (July), made sure to put a few indoor venues on my itinerary, including the Art Gallery. I was quite worried when I arrived at opening to find several school busloads of children pouring into the building, but I needn't have. They broke the kids into small groups of 6 to 10 kids and the docents were brilliant with them. The children were being so entertained and educated that they didn't have time to get noisy or obnoxious. There were practically no artists names I recognized, but that didn't keep me from having a wonderful time. They have a good assortment of European artists and locals, indigenous peoples and Asian art, from classic to modern art. Keep your eyes open for what you can and cannot photograph. The general rule is no Aboriginal art or the main hall pictures. But I asked the docent/security guard about certain pieces and he gave me the go ahead, and some interesting tidbits of knowledge as well. I was prepared to spend money to go in to see the temporary exhibits, but found the free areas to be more than enough for a wintry morning. Found some new artists to research and had a great time."

            "review": "Always something new to see and do. The Art Gallery of NSW is a very comprehensive art gallery in Sydney, Australia. With galleries devoted to Australian art (18th to 20th C), Aboriginal art, Asian art, contemporary art and European art, in which the artworks being exhibited are regularly updated from the vast collection, plus regular special exhibitions (the yearly Archibald prize is always popular, plus the recent Monet exhibition was also very popular), there is always something new to look at for regular visitors. (Tip: As most major international exhibits only visit one Australian city, interstate art lovers should regularly check out the website for major exhibits that you may want to travel to Sydney to see.)There is also an extensive program of free activities (such as movies related to the current exhibitions, guided tours, kids activities), an excellent caf\u00e9 that is not too expensive, a restaurant with wonderful views, and a delightful shop to visit, meaning that you can easily spend a large stretch of time here.One of my favourite features of the gallery is the Art After Hours extended opening hours on every Wednesday (the gallery is open to 9pm instead of the usual 5pm, with, you guessed it, more special talks and tours!) After coming across galleries in Europe that are open at least one evening a week, it was great for the AGNSW to introduce this - the only large gallery or museum in Sydney to do so. For visitors to Sydney who are disheartened by the deadness of the city on weekday evenings, I thoroughly recommend the gallery for an entertaining Wednesday evening."

            "review": "Art Gallery NSW - what's happening to exhibitions?. Visited the Art Gallery of NSW this afternoon. Nice stroll from the Rocks passing the weekend markets, then down along the Circular Quay listening to the sounds of a guitar playyed by basking artsist, then a quiet jog through the park that starts at the steps of the Opera House. There are 2 equestrian statues outside the Gallery by Gilbert Bayes - The Offerings of War and The Offerings of Peace. These two statues are by the English sculptor Gilbert Bayes [1872-1953]. They were commissioned in 1916 from 18 inch bronzed plaster models, submitted in 1915. Cast in London, dated 1923, they were finally erected in 1926, but only after considerable deliberation as to the most suitable position for them. They were initially intended for the two edges of the Gallery front stairway and these stairs still bear traces of their earlier bases. The one of the left of the Gallery entrance is titled The Offerings of War, and the one on the right The Offerings of Peace. The inscription beneath The Offerings of War reads 'That our house may stand forever / and that justice and mercy grow.' War holds a staff topped by a figure of Winged Victory. He also holds a bundle of swords and broken spear shafts. The inscription beneath The Offerings of Peace reads 'The real and lasting victories / are those of peace and not of war.' Peace offers the Arts and PlentyToday both sculptures were covered with wooden struts so you can hardly see the sculptures themselves. Talking to the Gallery guides I was told that these are not renovations but a new contemporary exhibition preparation for Tatzu Nishi. Tatzu Nishi settled in Germany about twenty years ago. His work focuses on all objects which make up our towns: public benches, lampposts, bus stops and especially monuments and statues. Diverting them from their first use, putting them in unexpected and incongruous situations, he introduces them in a different, funny and poetic light. Since 2001, he has been developing this more ambitious work around big classic sculptures that can be found in any city. The first time Tatzu Nishi exhibited in France he used Nantes Place Royale.According to the Art Gallery NSW deputy director Anne Flanagan Tatzu Nishi is working on War and Peace and In Between, commissioned by Kaldor Public Art Projects, installing his own visions and constructions around the 2 Gallery Sculptures. The work will be open to the public from 2 October through to February 2010. Let's hope it's worth the wait!Downstairs opposite the Gallery Members' Lounge on Lower Level 3 there is an interesting exhibition by Yiribana Aboriginal & Torres Strait Art which will run till 18 December 2009. The exhibition is called The Dreamers. This exhibition celebrates the lives and work of eight distinguished Aboriginal artists who have contributed significantly to Australia\u2019s cultural landscape. Profiling major bodies of work by Kutuwulumi Purawarrumpatu (Kitty Kantilla), Ronnie Tjampitjinpa, Rusty Peters, Dr David Malangi, John Mawurndjul, Ginger Riley Munduwalawala, Judy Watson and Munggurrawuy Yunupingu.Whilst it is popular between overseas visitors, I personally found the exhibits rather disappointing. Too many works on barks and carvings present more of the traditional mediums yet limited works on canvas are present. New mediums such as acrylic paints and canvas have added a new dimension for artists to explore and express themselves.Art forms such as ceramics, pottery and silk paintings have influenced and been incorporated into traditional Aboriginal art.The use of modern styles still allows for the passing on traditional tribal knowledge.I was disappointed not to see works by Tjapaltjarri, brothers who were part of a group known as the 'last of the nomads' and wandered from the desert to encounter white people for the first time in 1984 as their art forms are absolutely, 100 per cent not influenced by European art in any way.Instead of Tjapaltjarri's Tingari the room was filled with Ronnie's works. Seeking the contemporary works in orche the exhibition is rather limited to Rusty Peters. If you want a better experience of aboriginal art, you need to go upstairs to the information desk where on the wall behind you will find a diptich by Freddie Timms and a large Emily Kngwarreye. Hetti Perkins is a gallery's aboriginal art curator and rejected my proposal to add new items to the exhibition. I offered 150 artworks that typically exhibit in British Museum in London, Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly in Paris and trendy art galleries in NY suggesting they can have them for free and I was surprised to hear that the present works apparently \"represent the best of aboriginal art and the gallery does not need any help or suggestions\". The other exhibition worth mentioning is Silk Ikats of Central Asia from the collection of the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia (running for another 7 weeks till 11 October 2009). I enjoyed it endulging into the worlds of ancient history and fashion at the same time. Silk Ikats of Central Asia will display 50 exotic and colourful robes and textiles, wall coverings and jewellery, mainly from Uzbekistan, a land of nearly 30 million people. Central Asian ikats were almost unknown to the rest of the world until as recently as 20 years ago. While often the term ikat, derived from the Malay word for \u2018to tie\u2019 or \u2018to bind\u2019, is used to refer to the actual process, in Central Asia the Persian term abrbandi - literally cloud (abr) tying (band) is used. The dyeing and binding processes used to create ikats are complex, so the more colours and the more complex the patterns, the more admired the ikat. The rich colours are obtained from natural resources: yellow comes from saffron, black from the skins of pomegranates; red from crushed cochineal insects, and indigo from the indigo plant imported from India. While the origin of the technique of ikat dyeing is uncertain, we know it was practised in China, India, and Eygpt by at least the 7th century. Central Asia has always played a crucial role in east-west exchange because of the famous Silk Road that passed through its numerous cities. Silk Road trade brought great wealth to Central Asia, with textile production a major industry. The people of Central Asia have lived a turbulent history: in the 8th century they were conquered by Arabs who brought with them Islam which has been the major religion ever since. Later in the 13th and 14th century the Mongols came, and then from the mid 19th century it was Russia.Central Asian ikats became more widespread from the early 19th century until the first decade of the 20th century with Bukhara, one of the most ancient cities of Uzbekistan, the centre for the various workshops for weavers, dyers, designers, as well as a wealthy upper class who could afford the textiles. Bright patches of ikat weaving were also used as wall hangings to ornament private homes. Ikats continue to be admired; inspiring contemporary designers such as Oscar de la Renta.The Art Gallery of New South Wales is the leading museum of art in New South Wales and Sydney, and one of Australia's foremost cultural institutions. It holds significant collections of Australian, European and Asian art, and presents about 35-40 exhibitions annually.It's open every day except Good Friday and Christmas Day: 10am - 5pmOn Wednesday it closes late - 9pm as it holds Art After Hours weekly program. The late Wednesday night opening features a free events program with films, talks, performances, food and wine, alongside the exhibitions. The typical Wednesday curriculum is:5.30pm Exhibition Talk6.30pm Celebrity Talk7.15pm Free Art Film (presently running Silk Ikats Along the Silk Road ,The Cave of the yellow dog , Dir Byambasuren Davaa 2008) The best place to park is at The Domain Carpark that is open until 9pm. Parking is also available along Art Gallery Road (takes credit cards and coins, $2.20 per hour). The Gallery offers a complimentary Shuttle Bus to Martin Place every 15 minutes, from 7.15pm until after the last film, and you can take a train from there if needed.The first home for Sydney's art collection was at Clark's Assembly Hall in Elizabeth Street. This building, which had at one time been used for dancing classes, was rented between 1875 and 1879. It was open to the public on Friday and Saturday afternoons. The International Exhibition of 1879 provided an opportunity for the national collection to be re-housed more suitably. Space was initially allocated in the main hall of the Garden Palace, but as lighting and display possibilities were not considered adequate, the Government allowed William Wardell to construct a 'Fine Arts Annexe' of nine rooms near the entrance to the Botanic Gardens. This building was located roughly where the Glass Pyramid now stands. Concerns for the security and care of artworks, particularly after the fire which destroyed the Garden Palace in 1882, ruled out the Annexe as a permanent home for the collection. In December 1885 the collections were moved to a building of six rooms at the present site in the Domain.Early deliberations favoured a site for the Art Gallery on William Street, opposite the Australian Museum, where the recently built Cook and Phillip Park Recreation Centre now stands. Henry Copeland, Member for East Sydney, denounced the Trustees\u2019 preference for a site overlooking Woolloomooloo Bay as the worst possible choice after \u2018Fort Macquarie or Shark Island.\u2019The fa\u00e7ade and old wing of the Gallery were built between 1896 and 1909. Architecturally, Sydney's Art Gallery reflects nineteenth century ideas about the cultural role of a gallery as a temple to art and civilising values. Yet early designs for the gallery were less confident about the institution's role and image. The present building is the work of Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon, who secured the prestigious commission over the less conventional architect Horbury Hunt. Hunt had originally been employed by the Gallery when it was decided to move from a temporary wooden structure in the Botanic Gardens to the present site. He erected a building which was nothing more than a series of thick walls with a saw-tooth roof, planned to be the foundation of a more substantial building when funds became available. After ten years of design and funding disputes, Hunt was finally denied the opportunity of completing the gallery. His rejected designs are wildly varied. Stylistic eclecticism characterised much of Hunt's work. It exposed him to severe criticism, but also allowed genuine innovation and creativity. His rejected designs for the Art Gallery of New South Wales include a heavy Gothic structure with a blind arcade of pointed arches winding around the building, even a Byzantine/Islamic hybrid with Moorish arches and a series of domes. Some might agree with Hunt's biographer that he would have provided Sydney with one of its 'finest as well as most hilarious buildings' had he been given the opportunity. Hunt's designs, however, were rejected in favour of Vernon's present chaste, classical building. When Vernon's building was officially completed in February 1909, the press was full of praise. It was felt that the city at last had a public gallery worthy of Australia's Mother Colony and one which, as an added bonus, rivalled Melbourne's multi-purpose Museum, Library and Gallery. It was also viewed as a happy coincidence that the completion of the Sydney gallery coincided with the opening of Sir Aston Webb's grand additions to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Comparisons didn't go much further. Webb's rather strange pastiche of Renaissance styles, with pavilion domes, campaniles and a column-tiered tower is far removed from Walter Liberty Vernon's low-lying, simple classic gallery. Yet if Vernon had been left entirely to himself to design the Sydney gallery, we may have had a building more akin to Webb's museum than the present structure. Vernon's first design for the gallery included a dome, along with turrets and pinnacles. He was not an entirely conventional architect, as buildings like the Jacobean-style Challis House on Martin Place testify. Neither was he convinced of the superiority of a classic architectural vocabulary for public buildings. Indeed, throughout his career he tended to favour an adapted Gothic style, believing it admitted greater individuality and richness 'not obtainable in the colder and unbending lines of Pagan Classic.' In many ways, the Art Gallery of New South Wales is a departure from the style he was pursuing in the 1890s. He had abandoned the grand classical manner of his predecessor as Government Architect James Barnet, erecting more modest buildings in brick with stone dressing, incorporating Gothic and many other decorative elements. When one compares the Art Gallery of New South Wales with the former Premier's Office on Macquarie Street [1896], the Tudoresque Land Titles Office [1908] or the elaborate Perpendicular MacLaurin Hall at Sydney University [1902-9], it appears uncharacteristically chaste. The portico is hexastyle in design, with six Grecian Ionic columns supporting a pediment, the tympanum of which was left rough for future carving or decoration. The two end columns are coupled with similar columns behind them. The back portion of the portico encloses a lobby, used then and today as a coat check. This leads into a grand oval vestibule, considered to be Vernon's masterpiece. Its intimate proportions, detailing and use of marble and mosaic give it a sumptuous tone. It consists of two internal bays with apsidal ends. The two central bays are designed with coupled Ionic columns carrying arches which support domes, the central portion of which is glazed to provide lighting to the space. The apsidal ends have a colonnade of similar columns, between which are ornamental niches for statues and which support richly coffered semi-domes. The whole vestibule is of rubbed stone, with column shafts of polished Kempsey marble. Although facade and vestibule were completed in 1902, they were not made available to the public until the floor of the Main Hall was raised to the level of the new entrance. This took over four years to be achieved and generated a stream of acrimonious correspondence to the press about the spending of public monies on projects closed to public use. While this was being done, a basement gallery was opened on 31 October 1904, intended for the display of applied arts and for the gallery's collection of plaster casts and replicas. Today its staircase of Rockley, Fernbrook, Borenore and Molong marble makes an impressive entrance to the Art Gallery Research Library and Archive.On 20 February 1909 the entire fa\u00e7ade of the gallery was completed. A circular loggia at the end of the north-west wing differentiated it slightly from the one completed in 1897. As a concluding flourish, names of painters, sculptors and architects were lettered in bronze below the entablature of the building. Forty-four names were intended, thirty-two are to be found on the existing elevation. Painters' names appear on the southern half of the front elevation and on the adjoining side elevation to the south. Sculptors appear on the northern half of the front and were intended for the adjoining side elevation. Architects appear on the rear elevation. It was a peculiar selection of artists, partly representing Victorian tastes and partly the idiosyncratic choice of Eccleston du Faur.When in Sydney, make sure you drop in!"
