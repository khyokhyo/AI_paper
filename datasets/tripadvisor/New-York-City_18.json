Hadn't planned to got to the top of the New Trade Centre, but spent a very emotional morning at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and decided to buy tickets, did have to queue for tickets because we hadn't planned this visit, but only for half an hour. So glad we did though, what an experience!! Will always remember."

One world observatory is a must do in my opinion. We pre booked which was perfect as we walked straight in late afternoon. With 5 and 8 year olds, we decided to rent the iPads to make the experience a learning one for them. It would also allow us to stay longer. It was $15 well spent. The views were amazing, it was a beautiful clear day. I recommend visiting for sunset although it did get crowded. The staff were excellent throughout and made it a very enjoyable experience. I wish we had gone here first! Only downside was dealing with glare from Windows for photos. Any food and drink you buy there is also very expensive! Be warned. "

The elevator ride is interesting with its time lapse video and the arrival on the 102nd floor ushers the group into a small area with a picture of the NY skyline, a quick audio intro and then the photo lifts to reveal the real view below. I believe everyone in our group gasped. We spent a long time enjoying the 360 degree view. I think this is a must-see for first-timers. I did buy our tickets in advance (3 adults) and purchased the flex tickets. A wise decision worth the extra $ after seeing the long lines out front. The flex ticket is for a specific day any time during operating hours. We were able to walk right up and go inside. A real time saver. Stunning views and am so glad this was on our time constrained list of to dos."

It was busy but the lines moved fast and it didn't affect our viewing at the top. The views were spectacular. You could see for miles around. It really puts things in to perspective being that high off the ground. I could have done without the little presentation they show before letting you into the observatory deck. Oh and felt super secure, there were armed army personnel, police and security presence everywhere! Bathrooms were really clean too."

We were at Ground Zero a month before the dedication of the Pools. We've been back a few times to watch the progress. We went back this year to experience the 9/11 Museum and the One World Observatory. These were worth making the trip. The Museum was awesome and emotional. The One World Observatory was like nothing we've ever experienced in an observation deck. The weather was perfect that day so the views were incredible. The technology and sensory experience is breathtaking. Both elevator rides are worth the price of admission. We will most likely enjoy the experience any and every time we visit NY. To all who were responsible, wonderful job and thank you!"

I had intended to go see 1 world trade or \"The Freedom Tower\" as it hadn't been completed last time I was in Manhattan, and decided to go to the observatory on a whimCost was about $34 dollars, and yeah, there's was a bit of a queue. Visitors are let in in timed batches (2pm, 2:15 and so on) which quite a few people, including New Yorkers couldn't seem to get their heads around.There's quite a lot of security, akin to an airport, but that's understandable really.The elevator ride up is interesting, and pretty rapid considering it's 102 floors!The view is stunning, truly breathtaking, and I could have spent a lot longer just taking it all in.I'd have preferred a less busy day, as it was fairly packed, and I would suggest waiting to see what the weather is like before booking tickets, as a cloudy day would ruin the experience.Yeah, the coffee shop/restaurant is expensive, but I expected that and at the end of the day, no-one forces you to buy anything.The gift shop isn't ridiculously expensive.The staff were really friendly as well, even the guys on the door dealing with people moaning that at 1:55 they were being made to wait, despite having a ticket for 2:15.Well worth the money."

OK so you don't go for the cake but I needed to mention it just the same...lovely lemon pound cake and great coffee at the cafe at the top....we needed it as it was so interesting up there, we spent far longer there than we had anticipated.We visited on a Wednesday afternoon, we hadn't booked in advance because you need to see what the weather will do...if we had gone the previous day we would have seen nothing.The queue to get in looked long but moved very fast and in no time we were heading downstairs to take the elevator to the top.I am not saying anything about the ride except to say it is brilliant; you feel very moved by it (and not just in a physical going up way!).When you emerge into the bright sunlight the views are obviously spectacular; it is so absorbing and interesting to merely walk around but there are staff members if you have questions and there are interesting presentations at the City Pulse feature (and a good chance to sit down after walking round and round and round).Nice restrooms, plenty of seating and decent gift shop with everything you could imagine at every price point.And lovely cake....what a great day out!"

For those who don't like elevators, you don't feel it moving or coming to a standstill.As with everything in NY your visit is well orchestrated and security is always tight.There is a coffee shop and bar at the topand both are expensive, but what isn't in NY if you are a tourist? My cake cost $10!!!!!!! yummy though.You can spend as much time as you want at the top and there are regular commentaries given at 2 central points.We paid $15 for the Macbook guide, but to be truthful, if you did your homework before visiting, you would recognise what you were looking at. The only advantage to the Macbook was you got an audio description and a snippet of some facts to do with what you were looking at."

The Observatory offers truly spectacular views of all angles of New York City. Once at the top, you can spend as long as you like in the tower, looking out onto the landscape. Reasonably priced at $34.00 USD (about \u00a328.00 on today's exchange rate) this is for sure a must-visit site!"

As we were part of the 'All Access Tour' (Walking tour WTC, 9/11, Museum & One World Observatory), we had our tickets and then there was no queuing, no hassle, as there was a large queue and they let them in timed blocks. also, I wish someone had told me about the elevator experience, it was simply brilliant a journey through construction over the ages, I'll say no more as it would spoil it, the speed was also incredible. When you arrive you are corralled, then about 30 or so people stand against a rail in a long line, facing a screen, then the show starts,with music, vocals and then the big reveal of the skyline, all good stuff, very professional and slick.. You are then moved around two floors ,so they can get some money off you (they did with me $5.00 for a bottle of water,!as it was so hot), down two floors to the 360 observation deck. It was fairly busy trying to take photo's. The view was 25 miles+ on a fab sunny day, it was quite spooky when the planes are flying so close."

Then the very fast elevator does not take you to the observation deck. It takes you 2 floors above it where you get to stand through a presentation about renting ipads for an additional $15. After that you go down one floor and you have to stand through this long boring video of New York street scenes while a sound track tries to build drama for the unveiling of the view. The movie finally ends and the curtain moves to reveal the spectacular view. For all of about 10 seconds. Then you finally get to exit this room and enter an area where they want you to pose against a photo backdrop instead of the actual view from the tower. When you are finally allowed to exit this area you are sent through there deli/bar area. Because you might have more than $3 left and they want a chance to get it! Leaving this area you finally take an escalator down to the observatory floor. Here is where it's interesting. You can see miles in every direction, watch planes flying past on their way to Kennedy, they are actually flying below you. You get fabulous views of several major attractions including a great view of the Brooklyn Bridge. Just in case you were wondering, the souvenir stand is near the exit to the elevators."

However- very glad we did! A very interesting experience with different views from the other buildings. Bit of a disappointment though that they have no information as to what you can see but do have these fantastic ipads loaded with information - but then ask you for another $15 dollars to hire one! Very few people hired one when we were there which just goes to prove that they are too dear and tehy would probably hire more if they had a more reasonable charge of 5 dollars and would probably make more money overall. They did have 2 \"tour guides\" who did very interesting talks within the building. Worth while \"trip\" though"

The elevator had digital screens and it looked like the city was changing right before your eyes based on the year! I wish I would have recorded it! Amazing! When you arrive at the top (like a minute later) they show you a brief video on the walls and then that walls fold up and you see the view! Again, totally impressive and I wish I would have recorded it! I'm torn, because if I would have known, I would have recorded it, but not knowing made it so impressive and such a surprise. The views are beyond amazing. 102 floors above NYC make for wonderful views. You have the option to rent an \"iPad\" for $15 for assistance with your viewing. . We loved it. You hold it up to your view and it labels the buildings in front of you. It you click on the building link, there is a short video that plays describing the building. There is a cafe in the sky as well. Very expensive with no seating. But if you want breathtaking views while you have lunch, this is where to do it. We ordered for three (basically a sandwich and a beverage each and it cost $60). Would I do it again, yes!"

This review is not about the place but a bad cloudy day (Sat, Oct 8 at 5pm) totally ruined it, but the main issue was we were not informed of bad visibility. Apparently others told me that people who had paper tickets were being stamped and told specifically about visibility and since we had mobile tickets we were waived in and we missed the warning. Wish they would have told us. Once we were up there realized total zero visibility and chatting with some others came to know of the warning!!

I won't spoil it, but the elevator ride and initial orientation were a production. Then there was the hard sell for the iPad tour, which was good but another $15.00. If you are not a NY'er then get the iPad tour, just one for your group. It helps ID the buildings you are looking at. Some locations have a recorded description, but not for most of the locations and the compass was a off. There were several docents providing a lot more explanation of the sites, which was really helpful too. If you're on vacation in NY, go ahead and splurge on this activity, do it after the 911 museum, it's very uplifting (pun intended)."

Top tip is to buy the ticket and book your time well before you go. As an aside, the close by 911 museum is a great experience. We made the mistake of only leaving two and half hours to see this before going on to the One World Observatory. You need the best part of a half day to fully enjoy the museum."

You actually buy your tickets from the line at the counters directly in front of you as you enter the building which states it is reservations only. As soon as you leave the awesome entrance video, you are stopped from proceeding any further until the staff demonstrate their ipad/audio gadget which they excitedly tell you will locate any of the buildings circumnavigating the Observatory. Everyone gasps at the delight in this until they discover you have to pay extra for the privilege. A bit naughty really as you are ushered here and have no way of knowing you are being subjected to a sales pitch! The view at the top is stunning, a 360 degree view as far as the eye can see.

This was the first time we had been up there and watched the sun set over Manhattan. The biggest gripe for me was the design of the viewing deck doesn't lend itself to photographers as it is all enclosed glass, unlike the Empire State Building or Top Of The Rock which have open decks. Also the view looking north towards mid town is at the narrowest point of the building behind the large video display so space is limited and everyone wants to squeeze into the small area. That aside, it is definately worth a visit, if oly once. They have the usual tourist photo and try and add on as much as they can to get you to spend. It is nonetheless an impressive view of a great city!"

I don't want to spoil any of the surprises, but there is an incredible video that you will watch inside the elevator and then when get out you will watch one more before you can enter the observatory, but trust me it's worth the wait!!! You will get a 360\u00b0 view of the city, clean restrooms, and a small gift shop. You can spend as much time as you want up in the Observatory.

The apprehension was because of going up 102 floors. I needn't to have worried because it just faded away. The graphics in the lift (elevator) are stunning & then you go out into a platform where there is another graphics display & then the display wall lifts & you get an absolutely stunning view. It was really quite emotional. You then go through to the observatory itself where you can spend as much time as you like soaking in the views all around. We had great weather & so could see for miles. There is a restaurant serving food & beverages. We opted to use the iPads that pinpoint places of interest around NY & give you a little history lesson as well. These were being hired out for $15. There are guides around giving out information & there's a kind of a periscope glass floor (that's the best way that I can describe it) that you can see the traffic & people going about there business below. I would recommend that you buy your tickets in advance as we did which meant we skipped the queues."

The outside view was very hazy and visibility was limited to 10 or so miles. The haze disappeared somewhat around noon but the crowds started coming in. There were lectures about NYC that were interesting and were presented in a very professional manner. The cafe was expensive, with coffee costing $5. There was also a gift shop and a rental video tour. All in all, it's pretty expensive for a view of the city."

Just the elevator ride is nice and meaningful and the movie at the beginning with a very surprising ending (that I won\u00b4t reveal here) is such a powerful and nice treat. Once on the obeservation deck, the staff is very knowledgable and very easy to approach. I recommend getting the priority tickets and for the 9 am time slot. My daughter and I were first up the day we visited the tower. We were by ourselves in the elevator and spent approx 5 minutes by ourselves in front of the view towards uptown Manhattan.

If you pay more, you can obtain a Flex Pass for use at any time that day, plus you blow by all of the lines for priority service. I HIGHLY recommend spending the extra money. The elevator ride up and back is AMAZINGLY FAST but provides different entertainment each way. I won't give it away, but let you experience it for yourself. Be warned, there is a bit of tourist schlockiness to this place, with the photos you pose for, and the upselling of handheld IPads you can rent to $15 so you can zoom in on any buildings you see on the skyline that you want to know more about. The views are breathtaking! The greatest shortcoming of this tour comes in the form of the facility's eateries. Your tired, you want to sit down, but you can not enter a sitting area to eat unless you want to pay for their premium restaurant. When you first enter the eating area, there is a bistro on your right, for paninis, etc. It was unclear to us (and many others, we observed) of where to queue up, and that you had two dining choices (the restaurant and the bistro). It may be clear to those who work there, but it is a virtual unknown to the guests. If you order bistro food, you must STAND while you eat. This is just simply...STUPID! I know they are afraid of people settling in for too long and admiring the view while they eat, but this does not take into consideration foot weary tourists. You could tell many many people were less than thrilled by this situation. This truly takes away from this exhibit being as fine as it could be. So pony up the dough for premium eats and a seat, or be prepared to stand. This could (and needs to) be done better. "

First time when it opened on May 2015, when I lived across the street on South ENd Avenue, second time couple months later. Both times did not quite appeal to me much, except for the spectacular views.What I did not like is the way everything is setup. To get as much tourists is, it is strictly organized from bottom to the top. One can not slide though and just enjoy the elevator ride, its a mass happening. Once up there its like Disney land with animators telling stories and jokes and such. If I don\u00b4t like than while travelling, I certainly don\u00b4t want that up there, too!I managed to get away from the masses and have a look around. But anywhere you went and tried to take a picture, there was always someone in your way, or just passing while you took the pic, utterly annoying. It should be limited to just a bunch of visitors to enable everyone a nice happening. But as it seems, here again, like Empire state, everything is for profit. Anything else is worthless. So, yes, I did enjoy the view, as I lived just across the street and it was spectacular to watch my 35th floor apartment from higher above. Been waiting long enough for its opening but I must say, the view on Empire state is a much better one, as it is also out in the open, which here it is NOT!Anyone make their own opinion on this WTC experience. I\u00b4ve been there twice, but I don\u00b4t need to go there again."

I purchased the iPad viewer and was pleased that I did although my viewer - which you essentially point out at something and it will tell you what you are seeing e.g,. Statue of Liberty, UN etc. - was slightly off if you can believe it... hmmm.. a wee bit annoying. The food in the cafeteria section (where there is NO seating) is pricey for a pre-made sandwich or chips and the like. Eat before you go. Regardless, a nice once of a lifetime. If I were coming to NYC and could only do one \"tall building\" - I might choose Top of the Rock for the views of the city. Especially awesome at sunset."

            "review": "The must see attraction. It's cheaper to book online than just turn up. I arrived around 11.00 and joined the line to buy tickets which took half an hour. Once you get your tickets you go through airport style security. Once clear of security you go along a passage of a rocky terrain to get to the elevators or pods. Once in the pod it takes a minute to go to the 102 floor. The pod has a video screen which shows you the New York skyline and how it changes from way back to present. This distracts from the journey up. Once you arrive you come onto a landing and there is a short presentation which ends with the screens lifting to reveal New York. This is the first time you realise how high up,you are. You leave this area then there is a sales pitch to rent an iPad for 15 dollars to know which buildings are which. Most people left when the price was revealed. The observation deck is well organised and has plenty of room to see all the views. What you see is breathtaking and makes you wonder how it was built. There is a restaurant and gift centre on the deck. I spent an hour looking through all the windows and that was sufficient to me. In the pods on the way down you get the impression you are going along rather than down and the video screens show the outside of the building. I hate heights but had no issues with this building whatsoever and it's a must see attraction"

We hadn\u2019t planned on going up to the One World Trade Centre Observatory \u2013 but we were there, and there were no queues, and it\u2019s the tallest building\u2026. so we bought our tickets! We were planning on going up either the Empire State Building or the Rockefeller \u2018Top of the Rock\u2019 later on in our stay. On reflection, we should probably have stuck with our original plan! I can\u2019t compare, as we didn\u2019t have time to visit either of the other two icons \u2013 but this place has three definite disadvantages:The main problem is that there are no signs to indicate what you are actually looking at! The only way to have this information is to pay 15$ for an ipad gadget! Most unfair, when you have paid a high price for a ticket to get up there to see the views! Secondly, there are no seats in the interior of the observatory \u2013 even though there is lots of space! People sit on the window-ledges, which makes it very difficult to get close to the windows to see the views \u2013 particularly when so many tourists are constantly videoing or taking \u2018selfies\u2019 of themselves in front of the views!!! Finally, there is no open-air area, so photos are all affected by glare and reflection! The extensive, panoramic views from the One World Observatory are indeed absolutely fantastic \u2013 but would be more interesting if you knew what you were actually looking at, and if \u2018selfie-sticks\u2019 were banned so that you could get a clear view through the glass, unmarred by the hundreds of selfie-stick poles brandished by so many tourists! I suggest you research all three before deciding which one to go up. I wish we had stuck with our original plan for either the Empire State or the Top of the Rock! The prices are all on a par."

There are 3 observation floors and you really do get an amazing view of the city. The only negative to this attraction, in my spouse's opinion, is that there is no outside observation deck, as there is at the Space Needle. We also did Top of the Rock, and if you are choosing between them, we would recommend you do One World Observatory."

You won't get a better view of the Statue of Liberty unless you take a helicopter. The free wi-fi had a strong signal, although it was relatively quiet when we visited.On the negative, the viewing areas are entirely encapsulated by glass. On the bright morning we were there, that created unwelcome reflections on photos. The open air elements of Top of the Rock and the Empire State are distinctly better in this regard.Also, there was nowhere to sit between views, not even in the coffee shop (12USD for a tea and cappuccino both served in paper cups). Again, Top of the Rock beats this.There is no guidance on what landmarks are where - unless you rent a special iPad at 15USD. We didn't, so can't vouch for value."

When we got there, it looked like same-day tickets were being sold at a discount, and as we were entering we were told that we could, in fact, change our tickets for another day. Given the effort we'd made to get there, we really didn't have a choice but to stick to our plan, but we felt that we'd been ripped off.As a New Yorker, the WTC site has deep meaning, but I am disappointed in our experience.

And it was fabulous! Part Disney ride, part unique New York experience, the observatory is an absolute must for tourists and New Yorkers alike. I won't give spoilers here, but I will say that there is a surprise for visitors once they arrive at the observation level after a fun elevator ride that gives one a sort of \"time lapse\" view of Manhattan from prehistoric days to the 21st century. Aside from the star of the show -- the amazing views in all directions -- there is shopping, food and drink available up top. There is a quick-eats cafe as well as an honest to goodness sit down restaurant (with a bar/liquor license). We had a proper meal in the restaurant, and it was great. Not only did we have unparalleled views up and down the Hudson River and the harbor, but the food was sophisticated and quite good (not the norm for tourist attraction eateries). The fare is on the expensive side, of course, but then this is not a budget site in the first place. A tip: If avoiding long lines and controlling the timing of your visit are important to you, purchase timed tickets online in advance. We did that, and we were glad to know we could do other sightseeing (we went to the 9/11 Museum just before our visit) right up to the entry time on our tickets, because we would not have to stand in long queues just to purchase tickets to the Observatory. In any event, do go. It's a wonderful way to spend time in lower Manhattan, especially on a clear day!"

We got our tickets in advance which gives you a specific time to enter and so there was no long line on the day we went on October 1st. I suspect that the lines can be quite long during high season and waiting online to buy tickets would only add to the time you have to wait to go up. You have to pass security which is much like airport security(belts off, walking through a metal detector, bags, phones placed ina bi to be screened, etc) Once you pass security you essentially go through what looks like an underground tunnel that gives you video information about the people involved in the building of one world trade center. You see another short intro movie and then go to the elevators. 3 sides of the elevators are TV like screen that show you how the NY skyline has changed over the last 500 years. The elevator ride to the observatory is fast so its 500 years in 60 seconds. When the doors open you are at the upper level of the observatory(101st floor) . Here there are restaurants and gift shop. You can walk down one flight to the 100th floor and here is where you have a 360 degree view of the skyline. You can rent an IPAD that essentially will tell you what your looking at when you point it out the window. helpful but pricey at 15 dollars. If you have been to the empire State Building or the original towers observatory you get the feeling that this is more touristy. However, it is well done and for someone who has never been up that high, it is set up to give you a thrilling experience. It was foggy on my day and the views were limited.

The lifts to the observatory have screens all around which show the views as you go up. Once up top you first walk into a corridor where there is a short video presentation before the screens rise showing the actual view.After this you can walk around the 102 and 100 floors to take in the view. Great views of Staton Island etc. Personally I would have liked to see an open air observatory. There is also a restaurant and gift shop. It didn't seem too busy, but you do get some glare from the windows when taking photos. You can also hire ipads which give you virtual location and building names. These cost $15 to hire.Overall worth a visit, but my favorite is still top of the rock."

I hate heights and was really worried. There is one lift which speeds you to the top in under a minute. Your ears pop and you can feel the pressure changing but it is smooth. On arrival at the top you are shown a presentation and then the blinds raise and you get the most incredible view! I must admit that this was a knee knocking moment and I was concerned that I would be able to cope, but after a while it was fine and I am so pleased that I was brave enough to do it.We pre booked a day flex ticket which meant we could roll up at any time on the selected day, This was more expensive than the standard admission but we skipped all the queues and it meant that we were not pressured for time. We had walked over the Brooklyn Bridge from the Brooklyn side prior to this and the WTC was just a short walk from there."

This might have been teething problems as I say it was opening day. I don't want to spoil it too much but the lift to the top is amazing - very well constructed. The views are incredible- even though you are inside (rather than on the roof of a building like the Empire State) you can get right up close to the glass and look directly down - something that's difficult with other skyscrapers. There were a few interactive activities at the top but you probably won't need them. I'd love to go back late at night to see the view again"

            "review": "More than the view review. Yes the view is amazing, even on a somewhat hazy day. It would be awesome to be able to see it on a clear blue sky day. My time in NYC was limited and I decided to go anyway. I had been struggling with the decision to buy timed tickets in advance. At $37 it was expensive enough. I didn't want to spend an additional $20 for priority tickets or $30 more for a flexible time. Just not worth it to me, as I was in no particular rush, but no one wants to waste time in lines. I arrived on a Tuesday around 1:30pm. There was a quick moving line to purchase tickets and it was not an issue at all. I waited maybe 15 minutes to enter the building. Before I got in line I purchased a bottle of water from the vendor on the corner. It was $2, I later discovered the caf\u00e9 upstairs charged $ 5 for the same size bottle. Glad I picked it up outside. First you go through a security check point. It was quick and not an issue. An attendant then asks how many people in your party, before assigning you to an elevator. I was one of the last people to fit into the elevator. It was pretty packed with about 20 or so people. You are instructed to go in and face forward, with the elevator door closing behind you. I wish I had known that there would be a video being shown only on one back wall. I'm on the small side and could not see ANY of the NYC through the years video, over the heads of all the people in front of me. I did see above their heads the sky and years quickly rolling by. If you are small or have children, make sure to ask to wait for the next elevator rather than get in the back of 20 people and not be able to see anything. Really surprising with all the technological wiz going on, they could not have the video on more than one wall in the elevator. The ride is lightening fast and you don't realize how quick you are on the 102 floor. When you get off there is a long wall with a rail. They ask people as they get off the elevator to either move left or right and stand along the rail. When our elevator arrived all the spaces directly against the rail had people standing there. Again you had to cue up in back of them. Once again there is a video that I had trouble seeing much of because I was in back of taller people. The best spot to view the video is in the center, not to the right or left. At the end of the short video, a screen goes up and you get your first glimpse of the view. The screen quickly drops and you are encouraged to move to the observation floor 2 floors down.  On your way there you are ushered into the up-sell room where they do a demonstration of the $15 iPad rental. Then ushered into a photo op area. If you want, you can just keep walking and avoid both the iPad demo and the photo op. Unless you are interested in either there's no reason to stand and wait. You finally arrive at the observation 360* floor. The views really are incredible. I liked that you could spend as much time as you wanted, wherever you wanted on this floor. Pictures taken from the windows were very disappointing because of a predominate glare/ window reflection. It was not too crowded and I was able to get up against the windows and see the views from every vantage point. There is a caf\u00e9/bar on this floor as well. I walked through and the food looked good but I did not purchase anything. I'm not sure it's worth the premium price you would pay to eat there. I spent about 1 hour enjoying the view before descending and heading over to the 9/11 memorial. Overall well worth going. Possibly if it was a weekend or a holiday it would be worth getting the premium/flex/pre purchase pass. For mid afternoon, mid week, it was fine to go without advance tickets. I'm glad I didn't buy them ahead, as you need to account for weather conditions, when forecasts are notoriously inaccurate even a day or two out. I also would have had to adjust my schedule if I pre purchased for a specific time. I arrived at the OWO much earlier than I anticipated and earlier than I was thinking of purchasing a timed ticket. It's well worth going to, but use the tips to get the most out of the visit."

The cost for a ticket is about $35-$40, depending on what time you go up. It may seem expensive, but it's totally worth it. I would recommend going at one of the earlier prime times that are available. By doing this, you will get some good daytime and sunset photos before it gets dark. One thing to note though is that a lot of people come at the prime time, so it can be difficult to get good views and photos while it's at it's peak time. What I noticed is that everyone that shows up around the same time tend to leave at the same time. This results in a huge line for the elevator. I would recommend rather than waiting in that line, going up above to eat a pretzel or something and wait for everyone to leave. By doing this, you'll have a much easier time getting good nighttime views and photos. Rather than having to maneuver through 3 or 4 rows of people, you can just walk up to the window. The downside to doing this is that you'll end up spending a lot of time there. The views are fantastic, especially at night."

Being fully behind glass means there's always a reflection, which is worse at night making a low light shot almost impossible. Furthermore, only two windows look directly uptown meaning a queue forms at those spots.It is really a great view and a fantastic place to visit.

I was mesmerized by the city and its scale - and on that first trip, I visited BOTH of the Twin Towers: the observation deck in the south tower and Windows On The World for Sunday brunch. I am truly grateful that the site has been turned into a memorial with a museum that is a must-do while you are there.I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase tickets online before going - and the VIP pass is like a fast-pass at Disneyland - you go in any time near your reservation time. The elevators going up (and there are multiple) become a 3-D/360 experience of the growth of New York over the years. You are entertained whilst literally being on the smoothest elevator in the world!That spirit of \"awe\" and \"larger-than-life\" I experienced in the old WTC buildings so long ago was completely re-awakened on this trip - the view is simply beyond belief. The windows go entirely around 360 degrees, so the entire area is completely unobstructed (minus the core of the building). You arrive on the 102nd floor, and descend two floors as you enter the observation area. An iPad rental is available that matches what you see with the name of the buildings - we didn't purchase this option, as $15 seemed a bit much; however, if you want that option, it is there and available in multiple languages.We ended our multiple-photo day with a drink in the bar. That will be reviewed separately; it is recommended!The ONLY negative I have to say involves a color choice: white trim at the base of the floor air conditioning vents. There is a cute row of Manhattan-skyline buildings cut out of wood to discourage anyone from sitting on the venting - and that I'm more than fine with - it's the bright white color that is the problem: it reflects TERRIBLY when trying to look down to the base of the building. I wanted a picture of the site from above, but the glare is almost too much. A darker color would cut the glare down dramatically."

In the world trade center each window had a white outline of the skyline pointing out building and land marks of interest. One world has nothing. The people there are also do not have information.

This was excellent they could have just let us go to the top or not accommodate us in rebooking. We rebooked for the next day and went to the top. The lift (elevator) was excellent and really clever. The rest is meant to be a surprise. The views are excellent you really can see for miles around and that wasn't even on the clearest day, once you are up at the top there is plenty to do and look at and staff to talk you through things. They do offer you iPads which you can use to work out where things are but it's for a charge and with the staff and other people you can pretty quickly work out what is where.

You should buy your tickets in advance or couple with the museum ticket, it will be a better value than purchasing that day, plus you get right in. It is amazing how NY turned this tragedy into a tourist attraction, but it is worth the money to look out from that far above. The elevator rides up and down provide extremely informative and interesting information. You can get a bite to eat or a cocktail on the top but be prepared to pay! We ordered two bloody Mary's which were $17/each but after tax and automatics 18% gratuity, it was almost $50! Rather ridiculous, but, we were on vacation AND just chalked it up to live and learn!"

The views are really different and real amazing from this end of the city ... I spent about 3 hours at the top which felt like 15 mins ....there is so much to See and ponder on .

All the walls of the lift consist of video screens and it shows an amazing video of you going up but at the same time it takes you through how the city developed over time. Amazing!When coming out of the lift there is a short video shown on a wall of blocks and then they lift the blocks to show you the skyline. It was AMAZING!There is no restriction to the amount of time you can stay up there and I decided to wait until sunset. I am so glad I did so as the whole feel of it changed when it got dark.

What negatively impacted the experience most were the other tourists! People sitting on the edge for extended periods obstructing the views for others. People setting up their tripods to time a perfect shot. In that sense, I would ask that OWO do a better job of people management to ensure everyone has the same experience. Sure there is plenty of space; however, there are spots that become more congested at certain times. For example, at sunset the entire west and north side of the observatory is mobbed. At night the north end becomes clogged because people want to take photos with Midtown in the background. Oh and skip the iPad experience. Your phone can do the same thing, and it'll save you $!5."

Several people got lost due to her inability to manage a small group and her pace left many of the more physically able of the group scrambling to keep up with her. The best part of the tour was when we finally left the guide to go up to the observation area.

Probably the most exciting bits where the video animations in the elevator going up and down. You can move around two floors to get your 360 view, however you are behind glass at all times which unfortunately means dirty finger prints and reflections will ruin each and every shot you might take. The 'dining experience' on the 101 floor is so overpriced, you wouldn't believe it. We paid $6.50 just for a bottle of iced tea. Is this really necessary? It would have been nice to sit down, have a drink and enjoy the view. Instead you have sky high prices and nowhere to sit. Been there done that. But I don't think I will be back."

As as soon as you walk to the elevators pictures of the rebuilding efforts projected on the walls. The elevators are lighting fast and you're on top of the building in a flash. Ooohhhh....and the view is a sight to behold. You can see forever! The city buildings are like gems dotted on the landscape. You can only see the Brooklyn bridge from that vantage point to see just exquisite it really is. And the Hudson and East River blend into one another like old friends that were glad to embrace once again. The staff was very friendly and the food is good, if you can sit still long enough to eat. There was plenty staff to explain what you were looking at or you could rent an iPad that explained what was what when you point the device at a specific site. This is a venue that you cannot miss if you are in New York. As a New Yorker I'm always amazed at the majesty of this of this city. If you come here you will do yourself a disservice of you don't visit this awesome landmark. Enjoy!"

We had booked for 5:15 as we had reservations at ONE Dine at 6:15. The cost was $36.00 per person at that time but it seems like I read that it goes up closer to sunset times. I was a little worried about this excursion for a couple of reasons: 1- I don't like being packed like a sardine in an elevator and 2, I'm afraid of heights! My worry was for nothing! The elevator, while being packed, was an event not to be missed! First, LED technology allows the walls to flash 500 (?) years of New York history as you quickly ascend. And I mean quickly! More than 100 floors (you start below ground) in something like 49.5 seconds - my husband timed it on his phone. And then when you get to the top, the views are without equal. Yes, it is tricky to take pictures through the glass and there are lots of people wanting to do the same but the views/pictures you get are not ones you could get anywhere else. Take the time to sit at the \"City Buzz\" area and listen. It is so interesting to hear more about the city. The couple sitting next to me was from Long Island so I don't think it matters whether you're from that area or from Arkansas like me. There is something that appeals to everyone in what is being said. I would allow at least an hour to explore ONE World. We enjoyed our time there and definitely made some good memories. The website for ONE World is great and gives a good picture of what you will experience. Do be aware that you will go through security which is very similar to TSA at the airports. It's a good idea to allow a little extra time for that although it did move quickly. Don't miss this amazing place!"

My visit to One World Observatory was the last major thing I did during my 2016 New York visit, and I'm glad I made the effort. The experience begins when visitors enter the elevators that take them to the 102nd floor, and doesn't end until they exit again on the ground floor. I visited late in the evening and stayed until the sun had set, and was happy that I did so. While the views during the day are magnificent, the tinted windows make taking great photos difficult. However, once it gets dark, the window tinting doesn't seem to effect the quality of the images as much (see my photos). As for the facilities, due to the overwhelming demand to visit the observatory, visitors are not encouraged to stay more than absolutely necessary. The cafe does not provide seating for visitors, and very little seating is available on the main viewing floor. The setup appears to be geared to getting people in and out of OWO as quickly as possible. Still, if you are going to visit the Empire State Building, then a visit to the OWO should also be on your schedule."

Then you step out of the elevator and you are reputed to be able to see the curvature of the Earth--it was very clear when we were up there and if we couldn't see it when we visited, you couldn't see it. Anyway, the view was great and the exhibits were also informative. However, I don't think I'd ever go up again. We also went up to the deck of Rockefeller Center (about 63 floors) and I liked it much better. Big difference for me is that at the Rock, you can go outside on three levels. Next, you can see Central Park from the Rock and not so from the OWO. We weren't disappointed but, again, we wouldn't go back."

You get a real sense of how much this building means not only to the people of NYC, but all Americans, they are rightly very proud.Main reason we made the trip downtown to do it was to pay respect to the effort that NY and it's people had made to show these terrorists that we will and have prevailed, and our way of life is unchanged largely (apart from the security everywhere). It was our way of saying up yours and thumbing our nose to these people and their ideology. From a view perspective obviously it is awesome, but to be honest almost too high and the Top of the Rock uptown probably is better view (looking back to WTC). It was not about the view for us....."

You then get ushered along into a different area where they try sell you a virtual tour on an iPad at extra cost when it's already cost about $36 to get in. It's a bit of a tight squeeze through all that stuff to finally get to the observation area. Not a great place for photographs due to reflections on the glass.

It is actually disgraceful that Apple is associated with such a poorly made tool with all of the technology available. The managers/developers at One World Trade really need to rethink what they want the One World Explorer to do for visitors because it currently falls so short of the intent it was originally designed for."

Being a first time visitor, it really helped to quickly find well-known locations.We bought Flex Tickets since I was not sure of the exact time we would enter the observatory. It did cost a bit more, but entering was quick and easy.The ride of the elevator includes three walls displaying the development of Manhattan over the last several hundred years. While the elevator moved quickly to the top, it did not feel it. You can look through the top of the elevator and watch the ascent as well. The introductory theater, about a three minute film, has a memorable surprise at the end.We chose to order the photos (in advance) as well. The service is typical of other attractions. I had hoped the brightness level would look better, but I am ok with the final product.We rode the subway from Times Square to the Cortlandt St Station. I was surprised to see that we exited at the WTC memorial/mall area. It seems as though all of the trains merge to this one spot (Fulton Street Station, Cortlandt, WTC). After exiting the train, you can enter the 2016 opened WTC mall, and then exit outdoors to the 911 memorial.My biggest complaint is elevator access on the subway system. It is confusing, hard to find, or broken. A member of my group cannot easily take stairs, but it seemed this was not an option with the subway. I have never seen an area (New York City, in general) only sort-of ADA compliant; I am thinking I do not know the literal definition of ADA compliant."

Also, you have staff on the floor if you have questions about buildings and I had some and they were all very nice.

Like other attractions they ban tripods (fair enough) but the very thick (dirty)glass , coupled with the strong interior lighting means that getting a good quality nightcap photo was nearly impossible. I would be willing to pay a bit extra to get up there and have access to a spot outside. There are food and drink options at the top but they are pricey and so-so quality - the bar is small and the staff seem to to go out of their way to make it awkward to get in (or back out!) Like most of NYC they think a Cappuccino is watery stuff with soap foam on top so give the food a miss and take water with you as there isn't much access to water fountains upstairs"

The staff were generally very pleasant. We had coffees and a breakfast sandwich, but it was quite expensive and the lack of seating could be an issue for those with mobility issues and needing to sit to have a drink.The gift shop contained very few items made in the USA !! Most came from China - which was disappointing.Loved the experience though, well worth a visit although it rather pricey."

The building is impressive as the tallest in Western Hemisphere and beautiful. Now the elevator ride is a little scary but once you get to the top there is a two minute presentation then they lift screens and you see the view. It actually brought tears to my eyes. You are allowed to walk around, listen and learn for as long as you like. We enjoyed cocktails in the bar which were quite good. Just sitting and taking in the view would be enough though if you don't drink. The staff there is so friendly and when I asked them about their job there, they each said they had been there from the very beginning. That says it all for me."

We booked this place for the view and was offered so much more than we bargained for!Upon arrival, you are taken through a tour of how it was built whilst being unknowingly guided to the elevator which provides an entertaining video on the walls...it's really helpful as it takes your mind off being whizzed up 90+ floors. After this, we were taken to a short demo, my advise would be to have your cameras at the ready as it's quite something having an unexpected reveal to all of New York!The views are breathtaking. With no time limits on your ticket you can stay as long as you want until kick out time and with bars and cafe's up there with you, it helps pass the time. We decided to invest in a One world observatory wine bottle which was really good; this was created especially for the observatory so its that something a little unique and abit more special whilst enjoying the view. We were fortunate enough to see the transition from day to night where NY really does become alive!All in all, its definitley worth a visit!"

Now, let's back up to a few minutes earlier when I waited on (in) line (the queue) to be let in to wait again to buy tickets. I hadn't planned on stopping here so I didn't purchase advance tickets. I was a bit irked at the price of the tickets - $34 PLUS a same day processing fee of $3.00. What??? Someone swiped my card, hit the # of tickets I wanted and handed it to me... $3... in your head add up how much $3 for every transaction for the 3 to 4 clerks -- we're paying their annual income plus others! Needless to say, I felt the admission and fees were way high. However perspective wise - the building is high. Really high. Once you've parted with your $$, you head downstairs for the security check. Everything out of pockets, belt off, hat off. The newer body scan machine is used so it's very quick and easy. Next is the walk toward the elevators - through the Manhattan schist - literally. Very impressive looking - take the time to read the captions projected because it is pretty informative. Next is the elevator. This was the start of several jaw drops for me. The elevator was relatively empty (3 people) and the 3 sides (the 4th being the elevator doors) are all very high definition projectors - floor to ceiling. As the elevator goes up (and later when you come down) there is an amazing presentation of NYC rising. It was incredible. There's a short film with a really amazing ending - another jaw drop here. Next is \"forced sales stop #1\" where you get your photo taken with guess what as the background. I suppose it's a great momento for a family picture - but I very casually skipped it. From there is \"forced sales stop #2\" where you're given a sales pitch on why you should rent a $15 IPAD that will show you what everything is. If I hadn't already thought the admission and fee was too much I might have done that. But no way was I parting with another $15. Not only was there a person making the sales pitch - others were circulating among the captive audience with one to show off. From there it was simply looking out over the entire city. It was incredible."

Knowing the tragic events that occurred on this ground left my heart heavy but at the same time seeing the tribute that has been built to honor those that lost their life brought joy also. The observation deck gives you wonderful views all the way around and I would recommend it to everyone."

You are whisked up what is one of the fastest elevators in the world, but that's not the half of it. Ringing the top of the elevator walls - and they are deliberately 2 stories high - is a 360-degree moving projection and timeline, taking the city from its foundation to today - you can see each of the many buildings and developments taking place. I could have ridden the elevator itself a dozen times. You exit the elevator to a series of juxtaposed white pillars - different heights and distances forming a solid line, against which are projected sights, scenes, and sounds of NYC today. Just when you start to get a sense of the rhythm and vitality the designers are trying to portray, the walls whisk up and you are standing in front of a towering set of unencumbered windows- the observation windows of One World Trade Center. You make your way across to the 360 degree observation platform down a set of stairs, and you can spend all the time you want looking down at the city and the 20+ miles that surround it. You can rent an innovative iPad self-tour that is its own impressive piece of technology (and it's only $15). There is a snack bar, a nice restaurant, and a gift shop, but none of them are as \"in-your-face\" nor obligatory as, say, the Empire State Building. When you're finished, you once again board your elevator-come-thrill ride, but this time, it simulates busting out of the side of the building and hurtling itself down to the building's base. I can't think of another observation experience like this, but it will certainly spur similar developments in other cities. Definitely needs to be on your \"must-see\" list."

We purchased the priority tickets online to avoid standing in line for hours, and it was a very smart move. There was quite a long line snaked outside around the building when we arrived mid-morning and we walked right in, went thru security, stepped on the elevator, and were in the observatory in less than 5 minutes. (I highly suggest the priority tickets if you are crunched for time.) There are ipads to rent for $15 that you may point out towards the views that indicate what buildings you are viewing. The city below is breathtaking! You can see the Statue of Liberty, Manhattan, the bridges, the rivers, the 9/11 Memorial etc. There is a clear glass portal you may stand or walk on that looks down 100 stories below you, in real time. The observatory is quite spacious and there is room for everyone to get great views. There are restrooms, a restaurant, gift shop and various speakers throughout the 360 degree site. In my opinion, this is a must-see when visiting New York. The views are spectacular. This is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and is worth every penny."

Higher must be better, right? Well not exactly. The elevator ride up is indeed spectacular as you pass through a 360 degree digital animation of the evolution of the city. But as if that's not enough when you get to the top you're herded into another space to watch another hype video, this time an overwhelming and ever changing mosaic of scenes from the city with an insistent sound track. At its end the whole wall lifts away to reveal the view and just as you go wow you're moved on again. Round another corridor and you're greeted by someone on a microphone talking insistently at the crowd. By now we were getting quite frustrated as all we wanted was to see the view. When you do finally get into the large observation area it's actually a bit of an anti-climax. Everything has to be looked at through windows which naturally everyone gravitates towards. If you want to take photos it's quite frustrating made worse by greasy smears from many hands and reflections from the bright lighting which really affected our dusk shots. Why they've chosen to light it so brightly I do not know. There was too much Disney hype about this for us and the thing we actually came to see, the view, was difficult to photograph. This is great for kids I have no doubt but if you're after a city view you can take pictures of, go to the Empire State Building outdoor deck. It's much better."

It is very very different than the 9/11 memorial and focuses entirely on NYC and is very positive. PRO TIP: Get the VIP tickets to skip the massive line and get your video camera out and film the ride up. Very cool historical surprise. Also the iPad rental with the zoom and view is GPS tuned to your location. It is very clean and well organized and the staff were some of the best. Worth every second.

We were excited to see what the view was from the top and we were not dissappointed. After getting through security, you are transported to the \"foundation\" of the building and they really emphasize the rock that the building is sitting on. Once on the elevator to the top, (and it travels FAST), you are presented with a short movie playing on the walls of the elevator of New York and how it grew from the 1600s to today. Once at the top, you are shown another video and after it is over, they open up the wall to reveal the outside. WOW!! From there it is a short walk to the observation deck and it offers stunning 360 degree panoramic views of NYC. On our day, we had about 20 miles of visibility. The ride back down also had another video on the walls of the elevator. Must see attraction!"

You are definitely going to enjoy the spectacular views from the top of WTC One and learn more about NYC, especially since it is not crowded (at least when we were there in August, peak tourist time) and there are knowledgable guides who will offer to help locate and explain what you can see. You can have a meal with views at the snack bar (decent food, I thought) or in the sit-down restaurant, and of course get souvenirs at the gift shop, where the bathrooms are rather connivingly located. I would not recommend getting the $10 ipad they offer you, as the human guides at the top were a better resource for us. The midtown-facing windows are taken up by large displays which are used for for interesting explanatory sessions that take place almost continually. However, these displays obstruct the view of midtown Manhattan from what would be the two best corners to see it from, and many of the sights explained there (the Empire State Building, Broadway, etc) are best seen from observation decks nearer those sights (Top of the Rock or the ESB observatory). The best sights to see from WTC1 are the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Hudson River, the Brooklyn Bridge and lower Manhattan. When you are ready to leave, you may be tired of observing, but save some energy for enjoying the video in the down elevator, where you exit the tower, spiral around it and come back in for a landing."

Seeing NYC from that height is a blast (always has been, always will be), but be prepared, it's gonna cost you. If you want to avoid the lines it will cost you $56.00 per ticket. If you want to have a photo souvinier taken of you by one of their photographers add another $10. If you want to use their \"One World Explorer\" (basically an iPad Rental running a program that identitifes landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, etc.) that's another $15.00. A t-shirt in the gift shop: $34.95, a 6\" resin (that is, plastic) model of the building: 29.95. Total: $94.90 EXCLUDING food. If you plan on feeding anyone in your group, bring along another wad of cash.All of this is totally worth it (it was to me) but just this once. At nearly $100 bucks a pop, and with five nieces in tow, it will be a LONG time before I take them back to see the place. I paid the ticket price (high, but, I figured, it is a unique experience so...) but $10 for a picture? (we took our own for free using iPhones), $15 to see each landmark identified? (again, Google image search and various other apps did the job for free). The elevator ride up, is pretty spectacular but it's over before you can really appreciate it. Once at the top of the building, a lame \"See Forever Theatre\" presentation is little more than a bunch video clip art of NYC. \"Sky Portal\" lets you stand on a glass floor and stare down at video screens depicting what the view would be (if there WASN'T a building beneath your feet -- honestly a very creepy thing for most of the adults who -- to a person -- mumbled about \"9/11\" as the skirted this display). The so-called \"City Pulse\" experience is a bunch of TV screens arranged in a circle showing more images of NY (all of which pale next to the acutal view out the nearby windows).Yes, it was exciting to see the view again, but the whole experience seemed rather vulgar when every staff person we passed seemed to have their hand out asking us for more money."

The main observatory has huge panoramic windows that offer the most magnificent views of this bustling city. I was a little disappointed that you needed to rent the Ipads for an extra $15 to enjoy the full interactive experience.If you're not afraid of heights, then don't miss the 14 foot wide disc on the 100th floor.

The bar is pretty pricey, but this is to be expected for its location. The views from the observatory deck are brilliant and on a clear day you can see for miles! My only criticism is the sales pitch from the staff wanting you to rent a tablet - they approach you and start to chat, and once hooked in to a conversation, try to pressure sale tablet rental on to you.

There are 2 areas where someone provides a talk about a variety of topics dealing with the World Trade Center, or food in New York, or what to see and do in NY. It is well worth listening to the talks to learn more. If you can't stand for long, bring a wheelchair, as there is very little seating available. There are special Ipads available for $15 which show you what is located outside the tower. They aren't calibrated very well, and not nearly enough sites are labeled as to what they are.

Suggestion: try to reserve your tickets online to avoid the long line of the ticket office! And last thing to remind you is trying to protect everything in the building! I saw most of the people tried to take pictures very near the glass and stepped on the edge of the Windows or sat on the little building decoration on the edge of window!"

The guest experience has been well thought out from the walk to the lift, the lift journey itself and the short film before the best reveal ever. Very helpful guides are on hand to answer any questions you have about the view and life in NYC. David gave a very informative talk on the Brooklyn Bridge and Yellow cabs. Apart from a bit of attitude from the shop manager all other staff were professional and friendly. Needless to say we didn't bother spending our dollars in the shop though we had intended to. For a special treat we went to the bar for a cocktail - Manhattans and Uptowns of course! Delicious. Overall a fantastic two hours spent looking out over New York and beyond. Well worth a visit."

The building is new and very modern - the lift up to the 101 floor is amazing you get there is about a minute - taking in all the views around the city. The lift counts the floors and the height you are at. Once you reach the 101 floor you are shown a short film then you go through to the restaurant and the 102 floor at this stage you are 1776 feet up with spectacular views all around you. Most of the city landmarks are recognisable. You can hire a tablet which you just point at an area and it tells you where your are looking the cost of this is about $15. You can get the same information for free from any member of staff - who are all helpful. I felt that the gift shop was a little over priced but it didn't stop me buying. Its busy but well worth the trip. The is also known as the Freedom Tower. Its the newest building in the World Trade Centre buildings."

If you're worried about heights, don't be. I usually am affected but this is done so well that my brain didn't register we were going anywhere high until I saw the view at the top. The lifts have film inside them to distract nervous passengers. I was disappointed that there was no downloadable app as there are in other NY sights to get the most from the experience. Instead, there are iPads for hire for a further $15 to identify points of interest in the spectacular views. My friend and I took a map and managed with that to help us figure out what we were looking at. We went on a Saturday and encountered very little waiting time thanks to the slick organisation. However, we believe that there were too many people on the observation deck as we couldn't get close to the windows for any length of time as there were always people waiting to take our place. Watch the weather forecast before going as you need a good day to get the most from this."

That was our first mistake. It was a rainy day and once you exit the 9/11 Museum and Memorial, you cannot reenter, so we left after 4 hours, but did not get to see everything. When we got to the One World Observatory, we were told that we could still go up, but there was no visibility because of the clouds. We were pointed towards their ticket windows to reschedule our visit at no additional fee. That was nice, but since we bought our tickets online, we did not get the same discount. The next day the clouds broke and we went back for our One World Observatory experience. It was very good, but not something I would do on a repeat trip; primarily because of the cost. It is fairly expensive, but definitely worth it the first time. One note of caution, \"Take your time.\" If an area is blocked that you want to view or take a photo, just wait until it is clear. The only annoyance that I found was the well-intentioned speakers at different locations in the observatory broadcast their talk over the PA system and literally were so loud you could not have a conversation in a normal voice even on the opposite side of the observatory."

So was the short movie that was shown after reachting the top.After that we, but also a lot of other guests, were very disappointed. Let's find out why? What did we want to do when planning the trip to the observatory:1. have a good view on New York City,2. make some nice pictures of the City,3. make some nice pictures of our kids with the city on the background as a souvenir4. experience the City (see, smell and hear it).All of these options are not possible, because you are behind glass! The glass is bended backwards due to the shape of the tower, so it is not possible to look downward. It is impossible to make nice pictures, because the faces are inside in the shadow, so the city as background is overexposed. If you use a flash it is even worse because of the reflections in the glass. My advice: I don't know how the other observatories (Top of the Rock and Empire State Building) are organized. If you have similar intentions as I did, then please explore what their proposal is."

However, this is something you absolutely *must* witness. Whoever designed the observation area and the way it's presented to you deserves the biggest raise in the history of human civilization, because it's sheer perfection. Everything from the elevator ride to your initial glimpse of the view couldn't have been done better. If you want more details, go somewhere else.

We enjoyed the view, however to get to it you have to \"suffer\" through a lot of useless things, they actually hoard you through like sheep. We bought tickets online, which really helped, you can skip the first ticket lines and go downstairs to the entrance. Once you're in, they hoard you into an elevator. The movie you see while going up is pretty cool and well made. Once out of the elevator, they hoarded multiple elevators full into the first room where you see a really short movie (city skyline & some explanations), it's very artsy fartsy but not informational at all. At the end of it, they pull up the wall they're projecting on and you can see the view. However, due to so many people there, if you stand in the back you can't see much because there's so many people in front of you. Next they hoard everyone into another room and try to rent you some kind of ipad or similar which you can use to look through and it will show you what buildings there are etc, for an additional $15. A total rip off. I don't understand why people can't just enjoy the view, but need to view everything through a digital lens. And who cares what exact building it is, just enjoy! Anyway, once you pass that, you can finally go and enjoy the view. However, it's very difficult because there's hoards of people everyone, all taking selfies with the view, and running around into your pictures. The view is very nice, you can see far and it's great to be over downtown. Definitely different from the top of the rock. One very annoying thing is that there's 2 spots around where they put some person to explain about New York and what's on (events). One lady had an extremely shrill voice and yelled into the microphone. If I want to know what's on, I'll check it out online, I don't need someone up there when I'm trying to enjoy the view! In addition, most visitors are foreigners and don't understand them anyway. Just offer guidance to people who ask! Why do you need to constantly have noise and entertainment around?! Just let people enjoy the view in peace! All in all, I definitely wouldn't go again. The view is great but everything else....I'd rather forget!"

We were fortunate enough to see Manhattan and Brooklyn by day and then stayed for dinner, which offered an opportunity to see the same views by night (good tip to try and catch the time of day for both!)I gather the difference in cost between peak and off-peak is around $5, we went an hour before off-peak but it was worth the difference!"

We had absolutely no wait, the elevator is crazy fast and you don't realize you're moving. The views are astounding!! There's an offer to rent an iPad which you hold up and it identifies some of the more major buildings and areas you're looking at- I suggest going for it. It's nice, important and really pretty much necessary if you've spent so much to get up there otherwise you'll recognize the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty and the Chrysler Building but probably will miss some other sites. The building is magnificent and so is the underground shopping area. The architecture absolutely amazes me. Note: I was in NYC earlier in the month with another friend who had no interest in seeing the Freedom Tower- she thought it was built on the site of the World Trade Centers that were destroyed on 9/11. It's NOT. There was no mention of 9/11 and no tribute- that sacred ground is not far from the Freedom Tower but is not part of it."

The sunset over New Jersey is simply astonishing and you really feel as though you are on top of the world with New York spread out below you.

Restaurant was hugely expensive as was the shop. To be honest felt the staff here were disinterested and felt a sense of going through the motions here with no real passion. As for the guy in the shop who was looking at some paperwork while my daughter waited ages to pay and knowing she was standing there waiting with her money to pay, well let's just say he was lucky he didn't get a real mouthful.

This one was the last one we booked based on many reviews that recommended TOR as the best view in the city. I thought this one was the best of all of them. We arrived at 9am on Monday and it took us approximately 10 minutes to get to the top. The elevator ride was an awesome experience (the ride down was also excellent). When we arrived at the top, there was another presentation and it was pretty cool, I almost expected to see King Kong. If your goal is get great photos from the top, at this time of day, you will be shooting into the sunlight when you face the Empire State Building and Brooklyn Bridge. The other side, Statue of Liberty, will be in the sunlight, but, it is still a distance away. If photography is your primary goal, i would try to go mid day, you won't have the shadows, but, you also won't get the haze by shooting into the sun. At this time of day, there were no crowds, so there was no need to fight for position to be able to see, unlike the other buildings. They also have two informative sessions that we found very interesting. I liked the views of the other buildings but since they are all priced about the same, we felt that we got more for our money with this experience. There are many reviews out there that claim that TOR is the best view, but I have a feeling its because this view is fairly new, just over a year since it opened."

We pre booked our tickets before leaving the UK to beat the queues and it worked we had a time of 1500 and arrived at 1430 to see an enormous queue that went around the corner of the building but we just showed our tickets and walked straight in. After passing through security we very quickly found our selves in an express lift that was certainly quick. The views from the top are breathe taking and well worth the trip up. What was very very disappointing though was that by 1500 the windows had been touched, smeared, coughed on and were in a real mess making photography near impossible this was not helped by the angled glass and bright sunshine.The other option we had offered to us was an interactive Ipad so you held it up and it pointed out building etc that you could see all sounds very good but it wasn't.It had to be reset every few minutes as when paused it lost its place, it failed and needed replacing and it only told us about the main buildings that we already knew not the smaller odd looking ones that caught your eye.We also ate in the cafe area, nothing to write home about and certainly not worth the cost and they dont even let you sit down?Would I go again? No not unless the sky line changes in a huge way.Tips: Pre purchase tickets and if you use a Mastercard you get a discount.Tips: As with everything in NY go early.Tips: If you want to take good photographs take a cloth to clean the windows.Tips: Dont waste your money on the interactive Ipad."

We booked online in advance and went up at 9pm so we saw the city all lit up in the dark. The only down side was it was difficult to get decent photos as it reflects off the glass, but no big deal.

Restaurant and cafe costly as were most the items at the gift shop. View through glass, which and dusk was very grubby. Not outdoors so unlike the ESB and Rock it lacks atmosphere. Still a worthwhile experience, but if you only do one viewing platform in NYC, I'd suggest the Top of the Rock which still blows my mind!"

I am sure that everything I want to say has been said before.The 360 views and all that jazz, the height and whole experience of the landmark etc. Well that was all good as expected Now for the important matter or making a physical memory of your visit (photo and videos). The one advantage over the Empire State is that you don't have a fence which can sometimes get in your photos if you are not close enough to the front. Another advantage is that you can rest your fancy iPhone against the window and take a time lapse of the sunset. However taking photos after the sun has gone down is an issue as the window reflects the lights of the observatory to your camera lens. This making your photos look a bit amateur. But the most important factor is the view you actually get. From one world tower, you can see the Empire State, at Empire State you can see one world. However the Empire State gets lost in the distance and looks just like any other building as it is that far away from down town. But one world tower is taller and stands out better for a photo. From someone else's review - if it is your first time in NYC , head to Empire State then go to one world the next time."

The elevator ride to the 102 floor is vertigo inducing, as the walls of the elevator displays the New York skyline which morphs thru history the higher you go.

We passed. I bought a Gatorade at the snack bar for $6.50. Yet, despite this money grab, it was a great 360 degree view as you walk around a spacious circular viewing area. On a clear day you can see 4 states - New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. The descent was another dizzying video - very weird how it affected my balance.

My elderly mother tripped on an unmarked curb outside the tower and fell injuring her ankle. We made sure security wS made aware so these elevation changes can be marked in white or yellow as the dark gray pavement is difficult to differentiate levels for poor eyes."

Over the last few years I have been lucky enough to visit a number of the highest buildings on this planet, and to a certain extent have become a little blas\u00e9 about another view from a great height. However, upon visiting the World Trade Centre I was pleasantly surprised by the way that the experience has been enhanced.First of all, the 60 second trip to the top of the tower is turned into an educational journey. The sides of the elevator show Manhattan change from original empty fields into the New York that you see in front of you today. You are then greeted upon arrival at the top by another video presentation that ends with a spectacular view of the city. You then have the opportunity to see New York from every angle, and if you choose your time right (at a slightly higher cost) you can watch the sun go down and the lights come on around this great city.Only negative point that I would point out is that there is an additional charge of $15.00 for an iPad that will highlight the key points of the city for you. I found the iPad to be fairy useless as it didn't really enhance the experience (the highlighted points are fairy obvious to anyone that has spent time in the city), and the iPad quickly becomes more of a burden to carry rather than something that improves your experience.An experience that I would be happy to recommend, but if you are going to do either this or the Empire State then I would go for the latter. The Empire State has the history and similar views, and now appears to be a lot less crowded, probably due to the fact that the majority of tourists will now choose to go up the World Trade Centre and to the One World Observatory."

I didn't know what to expect from this place, so I have to say that I was surprised how nice the views are.The down side of the place is that for some reason the pillars and windowsills were too bright white to get nice photos through the windows, because also the window material is selected so that when I was standing in front of the windows, trying to take a photo I was always in that photo as a reflexion, even when I took the photo so that the lens was touching the window.They should apply some kind of film on the outside to reduce the sunlight coming through and making these reflexions possible, or then go there during the evening when the sun is not shining straight into the tower.Overall the views are excellent, but the observatory is quite noisy (not enough acoustic panels?), windows are really dirty and if you want nice photos be prepared to get disappointed. Also the price is too high for the quality of the place and the elevator videos are really nice, but they should be made with at least 4K and 60Hz to be more immersive."

The cost was $35 (around \u00a325) per person. We went up at 9 p.m. Getting into the tower was pretty quick, we didn't really have to queue for very long at all. The escalators take you up to the observatory levels in under 60 seconds where you are greeted by a short film before getting to see the views. The views itself across the city at night were stunning. You could see for miles. I'd definitely recommend going up at night as I'd imagine the sun could prevent good views and photos. That being said the only downside to going at night was the lack of darkness inside the observatory. It would be nice to have had part of a floor at least with no lights to enable clearer photos. I managed to get some decent shots by placing the camera lens directly onto the windows then blocking out any light around it with my hands but it was quite fiddly. I found it quite moving looking down onto the 9/11 memorial pools all lit up and trying to imagine that those two towers should be there."

The staff were polite and the people doing the \"Buzz\" were engaging, entertaining and knowledgeable. Buy tickets in advance, even if it's only minutes before. We drove down to the area (it was a Sunday so were able to find street parking) and after we parked went on line to book tickets. That enabled us to bypass lines. You are led to believe that you save $3 booking on line but there is a $3 / ticket \"processing fee\". Cheap shot advertising and a bit pricey."

We purchased our tickets from the attendants selling them just outside of the entry doors to the building (this seemed to be a quicker option than waiting in line inside at the ticket booths). Took an elevator up to the 102nd floor....smoothest and quickest 102 floor climb I've ever experienced! The walls of the elevator show a video of Manhattan's transition since the 19th century...fascinating quick look at the city over the decades.Once on the 102nd floor, you have your picture taken (you can purchase it for $20) and then are encouraged to rent an interactive tablet for $15 that shows you the names and history of each building in the view, when you point the tablet's camera in that direction. Interesting option, but we opted not to get one.The views of the city were utterly spectacular, thanks to a very clear day. We were also told that three states could be seen from this high up. You can walk around the entire floor, giving you a 360 degree view of the city. Just beautiful.We stayed for about an hour and felt like we had plenty of time to take in the sites and beauty. There is a small gift shop and bar in the observatory as well....we didn't stop in either, but nice to know they had these amenities."

Lift was an impressive start to the experience. Arriving at the top was OK but could have done without the PR video session but it was just made acceptable by how they finished it. The viewing area is well designed with lots of glass and not too many pillars (could have cleaned the glass more frequently as lots of greasy palm and finger prints meant getting a clear photo was never going to happen).Wanted to have an early dinner but all the tables were booked so just had a sundowner cocktail. Not surprisingly they were on the high side price wise (no pun intended) but were well made. Had to ask 7 (yes, seven) times for the bill and even when I started to walk out in annoyance no-one bothered to ask me to pay. Conscience prevailed and I had to tell the concierge I was either paying then and there or thanks for the free drinks - they got my bill pronto.Not quite the same quality experience when I had dinner at the old Top of the World but view was still worth the effort."

Each time I visit New York, I love it even more than the last time I visited! On my previous trip to New York, The New World Trade Center (Freedom Tower) was under construction. I told myself then, that a visit once it opened would be at the top of my list!  On this trip with my nieces, One World Observatory was one of our first attractions we visited! And, what an amazing, awe-inspiring, thrill it was!! There were five people in our group, age ranges 15-61 years old, and we all thoroughly enjoyed One World Observatory! Out of all the things we did while in New York, this was everyone's favorite attraction!  One World Observatory is a must-see, world class attraction! The building itself is a sight to behold! Stunning and majestic in every way! The attention to every detail is stellar.  Our trip to the top flowed smoothly, and effortlessly through the lines of people, and we never felt like it was taking too long, moving too slowly, nor did we ever feel rushed. They have an express pass to the top (which we did not purchase), and I do not recommend the express pass because you will miss a very exciting part of the tour if you purchase this option!! We all felt like the lines flowed quickly, and we are glad we did not purchase the express pass!  One World Observatory is a truly amazing experience! The experience brought tears to my eyes and made me proud to be an American! I don't want to give too much of the experience away... Let me just say, it is a must see, worth every penny, and I would do it again in a heartbeat! Make sure it tops your list on your next trip to the Big Apple!!"

A little frustrating that when you first get up there the windows are screened. Then finally they cut you loose, you go down one flight, and voila--unbelievable panoramic 360 degree views. The Statue of Liberty never looked so small (in stature, still big in our hearts). Wonderful guide Katie up at the top was providing information about the building and about other New York City topics, and facilitating debates amongst the kids about whether Titanosaurus is in fact the largest dinosaur. Thanks for everything Katie, you were the best. Also, if you didn't come in that way, it's worth peeking into the Oculus, the strange new transportation hub down below. The 9/11 memorial was very moving, but due to the kids sensitivity we only gave it a brief peek."

The picture in the ad was a romantic couple dressed up with champagne. Upon arrival we were forced to take the tour and then finally arrived to the observatory at 6:10. Our scheduled entrance/ viewing time was 6:00 pm. Thinking that music started at 6:00pm. We were finally told that the music started at 7pm and the place was filled with kids and strollers. No area was roped off for the guests expecting drinks and live music. We waited till 7:15pm- still no music and then we left as we had dinner reservations for 7:45pm. It was such a huge disappointment- and a total rip off! We spoke to Kim Fitzgerald who was there representing the marketing team. She offered no refund and you could tell that they didn't care at all that the event was so badly planned. She said the event started at 6:00pm just in case someone wanted to get a drink and stare at the view for an hour prior. This event has solidified my feelings that the Freedom tower wants nothing to do with actual New Yorkers and is purely a tourist attraction. Avoid this place at all costs. The drinks were pathetic and all they care about is the tourists."

For those who remember the original WTC observation deck - this is not that.The entire observatory is indoors (no rooftop access) and, while the views are spectacular, you can make a loop of the floor and be out in less than an hour. Basic admission is over $30pp and priority is over $50pp. We bought priority but there was no line when we got there so the basic people went up at the same time and saved $20. If there are big lines, it could be worth the extra cost. If you have a Mastercard you can buy a basic ticket and get it upgraded, but have to go to the booth to do it. Again - not an issue if there are no lines, but you take a chance.After going through security, you walk through an exhibit on the construction of the new building and get to the elevators. The elevator ride to the top was the coolest part. The walls of the elevator are screens which surround you with an evolving look at the surrounding area from the 1600s unitl today in one minute. You watch settlements form and farms and then office buildings, and skyscrapers until ultimately you reach the top, So well done.After leaving the elevators, they stop you to try to get people to rent an ipad for $15 which shows what you are looking at in multiple languages. Seemed like a needless novelty, and if you don't care about that, just walk past the people and head to the observation area. You will have to stop at a photo op station first, but it was quick.There is a gift shop, a snack bar and restaurant at the top as well. You have to buy admission to the deck to get access to the restaurant. Worth a visit, but was pricey for the experience."

Their coffee is a bit how you going though. Even before they allow you to line up you can go inside and buy your ticket/s, just go through the revolving doors.The 911 memorial is a must see, but upstairs maybe not so much as it's only through glass but still good if you can afford it and you have time."

            "review": "\"WOW!\" is enough, but doesn't come close to doing it justice. My wife and I had been to the Empire State Building, and we visited the 9/11 Museum on an earlier visit this year, but wanted a clearer day to go to the top of One World Trade Center. We looked at the forecast, picked a date and time, and bought the tickets.There is a main entrance at street level (which we took in); however, there appears to be a way in from the Oculus level, as there is a way out that way. In either case, expect to have airport-like security- shoes stay on, but belts come off, pockets emptied, and bags all screened through an x-ray machine while you go through a metal detector. After that, you walk past projections on walls with vignettes about the building of the building; you also walk through passages dug through the bedrock as other facts are flashed on the rocks. You finally get to the elevator bank, enter a pod, and if you just close your eyes for the ride (less than 60 seconds!) you will miss a fantastic show on the elevator walls, showing what floor you are going past, how high up you are, and a look at how New York City looked at that height from about 1500 on.Your first stop at the top after your ears pop is a brief video feature about the city and the building of One World Trade Center (with a surprise twist ending). Next is a talk about where to go an a pitch to have you went a One World Explorer- an iPad that will show you what you are looking at on the screen, highlight some buildings/features, and in many cases allow you to get more information about them in a number of languages. It uses GPS technology to know which way you are looking (you may have to recalibrate it as you go, mine at least kept going off the mark)- if you know your city, you can skip this, but it does have some fun information on it. It also doesn't point out EVERY building/landmark, and it also appears to point out some you cannot see, like St. Patrick's Cathedral. Somewhere at or before this point you get to have your picture taken in front of a green screen; at the end of your time at the observation level you can view your picture and order it to be waiting for you at the bottom when you leave, a digital download is included in one package of two pictures.There is a restaurant / carry out area with a display of some historical items. There is a talk by a guide who an use a circular video wall (think \"City on the Edge of Forever\" from the original \"Star Trek\" series, but with the pictures on the ring instead of in the middle) to go into a bit more depth on various topics; that person and other guides are there to answer questions. There is a gift shop (surprise) at the exit to the elevators.Oh, the view, which is why you came up here in the first place. I'd say spectacular, but that would be an understatement. It was pretty impressive to be looking down at the hotel we were staying at, on the 47th floor, and see it was not even halfway up to where we were. It was a bit hazy otherwise we could have seen far north (I believe Bear Mountain can be seen from the top on a perfect day); the view of the bridges and the skyline (obviously) cannot be beat (although the iconic Empire State Building is in the same league).What will it cost? Our discount tickets up were $25 (normally about $35); the rental of the One World Explorer iPad was $15 (tax included); the set of two pictures was $27.18 (tax included). Note that it might be hard to get pictures out the windows depending on the lighting/reflection. But with the camera at or against the glass there does not seem to be much of a problem."

The cost of picture of us taken upstairs was 20$, I decided to pass.The only benefit from the expensive price is that you don't have to wait. I went at 3 PM on a Monday, and I virtually had to wait 10 minutes from outside the building to inside the elevator!The only thing missing would be an outside platform. I did like it however.

Also pre-book on line to get this cost but suggest doing it as late as possible having checked the weather first - booking weeks in advance means you are taking chances with the weather (clouds/rain will spoil the views but assured there is no wind affect).Entry to lifts is via airport style security and there are queues which you can skip if you go premium for an extra $22 per person. Depends on how valuable your time is as to whether this is worth it as it does get busy.Lifts get you to the top in 47seconds which is fast (not that you notice) and walls show you the story of New York's development in time lapse which is cool and very clever.Once in, you are given an introduction and then pitched the interactive I-pads which are pretty cool, but already out of date (through speed of development outside) and give overview of key landmarks only. Suggest you save your $15 and hunt out one of the floor walkers who are very knowlegable. Big Mike with the moustache is particularly good and happy to answer questions. Additionally there are presentations held in the north and south corners although we didn't listen to one.There is a restaurant on the upper level although we didn't eat there so no clue on the cost or quality. There is also usual merchandise and official green screen photos (why green screen?) if you are inclined.But ultimately you are there for the view! Stunning 360 views of the entire area which you can do at your leisure and they don't cram the floor so you can always get a window. The view up Manhatten to the north is especially breathtaking. If you are in New York, has to be on your 'to-do' list.Highly recommend but avoid the add-ons."

I had heard the line can get very long but it wasn\u2019t for us. There are informative and poignant video montages about the building of this New York City icon on the way to the elevator. You walk through the \u201cbedrock\u201d and onto the elevator where you see the growth of the skyline portrayed on the screened walls. The old North Tower, which would have been right next to this building, is glimpsed for a moment but it was a nice homage. This isn\u2019t about 9/11. That\u2019s for the museum down below.If anything, I miss being able to go outside on the roof like on the old tower. Taking photos through the windows with a lot of light reflection is the only option. The views were great on such a clear night. Other than not being able to go on the roof, my only gripe is the narrow areas of the building are aligned with the lower and upper part of Manhattan and are behind a video based info/demo area. This made for limited, direct, uptown and downtown viewing unless viewing at an angle.No matter. If visiting NYC, it\u2019s a must!"

Definitely strive for a clear day if you can. There is an option to rent an ipad that walks & talks you through all of the different attraction points that you can see and this is well worth the $10/15 it cost. It allows you to take your time and take in all that there is to see. A note of caution though that there is no mention/learning about 911 so if you're seeking that then be sure to visit Ground Zero Memorial."

We had no idea how crowded it would beIt was a terrific experience, whether you remember 9/11 or not. There's nothing really there to make the visitor think of the Trade Center bombings per se, so if you are a non-US visitor or a young child, the visit to the OWO will still be meaningful. But, if you do remember 9/11, this building will be even more meaningful. On the way up to the observation floors, elevator passengers are treated to a video of NY through the ages in about 60 seconds. Before entering the observation floors, the visitors get to clear their minds with a quick video. Then ... wowser ... the panoramic view is enough to take your breath away. Getting there @ 9AM means at first there aren't that many people, so it's easy to see out and down. Looking at NYC's boroughs from above distorts distances - at least it did for us - we thought \"we can walk to __\" then we realized it was much further than we thought. There are two observation levels and a couple of places to eat. We did not eat there, so I cannot comment on prices, food, or how tasty it is. We walked around the city, so to speak, a couple or three times. It is positively and totally terrific."

The whole way they parade you through with ropes and partitions and rising screens along with the picture taking and hawking of ipads before allowing you to enter the observatory was off-putting. I still like the view from Top of the Rock best, and the ambience and history of Empire State Building better."

Schedule your tour in advance as they tend to fill up quick. The experience starts as you approach the building. It is a beautiful building standing out as a symbol of resolve and remembrance. Once you enter you are able to walk though an exhibit of pictures and voices of the workers who built the tower and what they felt as they worked. Once you pass through that portion there is a spectacular elevator ride to the top observation deck. The elevator gives you a glimpse into the history of the city of New York since the beginning to today. The observation area is phenomenal. 360 degree views of the city are breathtaking. There are team members that put on discussions and talks if you are interested as well as an area to dine plus another area for purchasing gifts, if you are so inclined. Though we did not use it, you can rent an ipad that allows you to point at any part of the view and it will tell you what you are looking at, historical information, and much more interesting data. Would be worth it if you are able to spend the time to go through everything it has to offer. I highly recommend this site as a follow on to the 9/11 Memorial. It shows first the pain, then the triumph and resolve. Very powerful."

The unique elevator ride, the informative movie before stepping into the viewing gallery all add to the experience in a perfect way. And not to mention the views of new york, new jersey. We could also easily spot the statue of liberty. We timed our visit in a way so that we could see the views in daylight as well as the whole city light up at night. I would suggest a time of 7/7:30 to enjoy both the views( in summer). My parents who were first time tourists in new york were mesmerized. As for the price there are packages available for families which are certainly wallet friendly and also the ticket price in itself is economical for a one time experience. Definitely a must visit while in new york."

Millions of times we had been to NYC but this is the first time we actually decided to c the observation desk at One World Trade Center. Absolutely fantastic. The animations inside the elevators, the entire story of why and how and what exactly those men and women achieved since 9/11. A great place for a new start on our most hallowed ground.That's why I have to add this now for all military (active duty members like me) and their families and especially for ONE person from Texas who complained about a $2 military discount here on June 15th. First: that's NOT true, military (active duty) were always free here, I heard it from all my comrades in central PA and I visited the One WTC today, Sat Aug 20th 2016 and got FREE admission, my wife got $3 off, this is really really appreciated! So I never heard about a $2 discount for military, now as of today it's FREE!!I cannot imagine how much it might cost to run a place like this, all those enthusiastic employees working in a building which stands for everything our great nations values... That's why here comes...... Second: how do people DARE to complain about Discounts. Especially YOU Sir from Texas??That is absolutely disgraceful and shows that we still have to many people in our service who give a damn and needs some discipline. A discount is a benefit , it's like a gift, u get it or u don't. This building on our most hallowed grounds needs $$ to b able to give everybody the opportunity to enjoy this spectacular view and that's all what trip advisor is about what Mr Texas doesn't understand, to give a feedback about this wonderful place which my wife and I really enjoyed. Shame on everybody who complains about discounts!!! That's extremely unamerican.This is a great place, I give full 5 points and not just 1 point like a guy from Texas did cause of being unappreciated. LOL"

OWO does give a great view of the mid town skyline and out across to Liberty Island and Brooklyn but if you can only do one I would choose Top of the Rock.I think part of my reasoning apart from the location, is that OWO felt literally like they were trying to take more money at every opportunity. I wouldn't bother with the extra $15 for the iPad viewfinder guide if you know the key skyscrapers to look for.We had a bite to eat at the cafe and I expected it to be pricey as they have a captive audience, so swallowed the fact that it cost $6 for a muffin but $5 for a small bottle of water is not acceptable.

We were advised that the haze would restrict views to 3-4 miles, but our tickets - which, at $37, are more expensive than the other observatories - were promptly marked with 'zero visibility'.You might expect that discounted tickets would be offered if visibility is poor. On this occasion, things did improve somewhat over the course of our viewing. The view from midtown skyscrapers is arguably better, but this is the largest building in the Western Hemisphere and it was somewhat less crowded and easier to get around. There was also a very enthusiastic speaker who spoke about some of the things to see and do in NYC."

It is nice that you can walk around with a 360\u00b0 view of NYC. Also the floor to ceiling windows helps seeing a lot. In comparison to the other two observation decks I was missing some atmosphere though. I didn't like the fact that One World Observation is not open air and that you are always surrounded by glass (one fact why I preffer Top of the Rock). The glass windows also make it really hard to take nice pictures. It is worth a visit but next time I go to Top of the Rock again."

There was not much of a line outside (just as well because the weather was sweltering); still it was over 30 minutes before I got my ticket, waited for my group to enter and could take the elevator up. The cost is $35 - rather steep, in my opinion, and then they try to get you to rent their augmented reality iPads and get your picture taken to add substantially to that total. But they are not terribly pushy, and if you just want to take in the view and take a few shots, you are welcome to do so. The thing of it is that it is very far away from eveything. You do see the Statue of Liberty, but really tiny. The Midtown Manhattan skyline is there in all its glory, but a little too far away for great viewing. So, in my opinion, it was worth it for checking off the One World Trade Center view from the top on a bucket list. I'm glad I went, but I don't need to return."

Finally after our quick frisk were were off to the top! Or actually, a long dark corridor or stuff to show how they built the tower. Finally squashed into the lifts with no room to move and about 15 new close friends we were off to the top! The lift has screens which show images, great if you don't get motion sick or can actually see them between the crowd. at last the top! Nope, still not there. We were literally pushed into lines like sheep and made to watch some video about the city. The one we were all at, and had experienced just moments before. People need to realise these screens are not fun for people with eye problems who cannot see and feel sick from quick moving things with 3d effects. After some nauseated moments the screen dramatically disappeared and we saw the view. Ok, this is it, we are finally free. Nope. Pushed again we had to watch a sales pitch about $15 iPad rentals. What! No! So we walked again and finally were allowed to go off and look at the view, 45 minutes after entering the building. Absolutely ridiculous. A waste of time. There is food and drink available up the top but no where to sit so good luck with that. "

After the family visits we travelled to the West Coast to visit San Francisco and the Bay Area, and L.A.I liked my (former) English teacher very much, but we unfortunately lost out of sight: she got married and became a mother of 2kids - I began my studies of business administration and engineering at a Technical University in Germany.Some 15 - 20 ys. later we met again and there was still this magic between us, but she was a married mother of 2 kids. - Ce la vie!

Again, they try to take your photos that you can buy at the end for another $20 but a selfie is much more economical and more genuine than your body being superimposed onto an image of the views.

I highly recommend to come around 30 minutes before sunset so you can see both, daytime and night NY.

The food is good, waiter served and comfortable. It's open plan with the observatory below so noisy/lively.

More Bistro and casual dining with no dress code, which is good for lunch etc. as part of the tour. If you are only interested in a posh meal this is not fit you, and spend half as much at street level.

The journey begins by going DOWN to a basement level for a bit of orientation and history (a clever way of spacing out the crowds with some educational material thrown in, rather than just a dull switchback line). The elevator ride is a highlight; as you ascend there is an historical 360-degree overview projected onto the walls of the elevator of what you'd see outside as each decade passes, from Precolumbian Native American settlements through the Dutch and English colonial period, and on through to the present day. The ride is fast; faster than I recall from the Twin Towers. Once on top, there is a brief introduction before the curtain is raised, so to speak, and you glimpse the city from from your lofty vantage point. Those in a hurry to get to the view may resent the preliminaries, but these are, I think, thoughtfully done and are a much better way to pass the time than just meandering through a long line. There is ample space in the main viewing area (and the high ceiling adds to the sense of openness); tablet computers are available for visitors with a special app that allows you to hold up the screen to the window and use identify what exactly you are looking down at (again, a great educational tool). There is a smaller viewing area above the main area with cafe; a gift store is located on the primary viewing floor. The staff throughout was very friendly and seemed to actually enjoy being there and helping with questions, etc. One unsuccessful element was a sort of stage set (partially blocking a prime northward view) for a \"guide\" who gave a (loud) talk about various aspect of the view, the city, and touring the area -- I didn't notice many folks paying attention, despite the (rather forced) enthusiasm of the speakers, and it detracted from the overall experience. A less intrusive approach would be better. Wheelchair or stroller access requires assistance from staff and some behind-the-scenes detours, but it seemed that staff was plentiful and very cheerfully helped out."

The day was 100% cloudy and the whole building was socked in. Since we could not get a refund we rode the elevator up anyways. We literally could see nothing - - it looked like grey soup. We even hung around at the top for an hour or so but nothing cleared. At that time the ticket window said they could switch our tickets to the next day but we were only in the city for one day.

He is in love with tall buildings and we did the Empire State Building on his last visit. This for me was a better experience although my wife like the open air of the 88th floor of the Empire State a little better. While I am an NYC resident and clearly remember 9/11, my grandson wasn't even born in 2001. Although they discussed it at his school, he did not really have a good understanding. A walk through the grounds and a stop at the memorial pools gave us a chance to increase his understanding. I will wait until he is older for a 9/11 memorial museum tour.I had purchased standard tickets a few days before for a 1:30 PM admission time. Even though we were early (about 30 minutes), it seemed that as long as we had a ticket the entrance time at the ticket was not relevant. We visited on a Sunday afternoon in the summer and were told to go right in. The only line evident was the one to purchase tickets. Spend as much time as you would like on the walk to the elevators looking at the history of building the new WTC. The elevator ride up was also fascinating as the walls depicted NYC from the 1500' s through 2014. The view from the observation floor was amazing. Floor to ceiling windows will let you see for miles. First time visitors to NYC may want to rent the I Pad viewer for $15 which when aimed out the windows labels all of the major buildings for you.I think we made some good choices. We opted for the standard admission ticket. After our visit, it didn't seem to me that the extra expense for a flex ticket or priority ticket was necessary. We also opted to take public transportation. The E train from Penn Station was quick and an easy walk from the World Trade Center stop to One World. Make sure you leave some time to walk the grounds and stop by the reflecting pools."

The whole experience seriously starts from the bedrock up with structural, cultural and historical references from the amazing elevator ride, the various \"tour guides\" available or shut it all out and enjoy the views. \"High priced\" cafe/restaurant/bar is up top and of course a souvenir shop. Plenty of room and windows to view the city through. No time limit when you get up top. Easy access by all. Allow at least one hour if just viewing. I didn't see a need to purchase the higher end tickets if time is of issue at least when we went. Light security before entering the building and lots of ticket checks till you pass security.

Nobody controls the exit hour so you can stay as long as you want. It's great to watch new york in those 3 different moments.The view is fantastic.The only \"but\" y that because of the glass of the windows, the pictures sometimes catch some reflections."

Once at the top (for any additional fee of course) you can rent an iPad with augmented reality. That means that no matter what direction you point it in it (even if it's too rainy or foggy to see) it will show what your are looking as if it was a perfectly clear day and it tells you what you are looking at, as inn the names of building, parks, etc... You can touch any of those and it will you give more information on that site, It's really pretty cool. You must make reservation and/or have tickets to got to the deck. ( recommend reservations, that way you can avoid the lines)."

When we arrived we simply went down the escalator then around the corner to the security check. After the check point, we were \"welcomed\" in different languages to a \"tunnel\" of videos showing workers of the one world observatory. Then we walked through the bedrock foundations to the elevators. The video in the elevator was awesome! It showed the skyline from when there was nothing but prairie. After exiting the elevator there are restrooms. The woman's restrooms were clean and had fresh flowers. They have an area on the top where you can rent iPads that talk about the skyline etc. However, you can save your money and simply ask any employee and they use their iPads to explain anything. The employees are very knowledgable. We exited and were herded into another room to see another video. It was about NY and then when it was completed the screen went up to reveal the windows and the views. After the \"OHs and AHs\" we went onto the observatory. They have a real time video on the floor of the street level view. This was neat as you could see little people riding bikes, walking, and NYC traffic. They have a \"wheel of NYC\" where an employee will talk about NY. There is a restaurant and before you enter the restaurant there is food you can buy and eat on your feet at some tables. Expensive. I tried the grilled cheese which was $10 and a $6 Sweet Sam's Cupcake that looked like a Hostess cupcake. I would skip the grilled cheese as it didn't have enough cheese to the bread ratio. BUT: BUY THE CUPCAKE! Best I ever had!!! For the \"gift shop\" there is a small area with items to buy. Not much of a good variety. There is also another restroom in that same area. You can also view your pictures beside the gift shop. When you go down the elevator it has a different video. We really enjoyed this attraction."

A must for a NYC visitor, interesting, but the old WTC Observation Deck was higher, open-air and way better. Sad memories...It was not crowded when we visited, but I would advise to buy tickets in advance, on the Web page. Look for discounts (Travelzoo, Groupon, etc.) before you commit to a day and time. Show up one hour before sunset to see the city by day and by night, you can stay up there as long as you wish. There is food and a gift shop inside the Observatory.They made it kind of a well-organized theme park experience, helped by amazing technology, very informative, but do not expect to take really great pictures of the breathtaking view, because the double-pane thick windows, full of reflections and fingerprints, will stay in your way. I was expecting, at least, that the light reflections be managed somehow by architectural design, or, at least, a little cleaner windows... The sub-ground level entrance wanted to showcase the bedrock on which the WTC was built, but it proved to be just an ill-inspired plaster rendition of wind-eroded rocks (safety concern?), in any case not a copy of the actual WTC bedrock (which you can actually see in the 9-11 Museum)."

You could see the Statue of Liberty clearly, all of Jersey and beyond, Manhattan's skyline, Queens and Brooklyn, the ocean bordering everywhere, and finally down below you (9/11 memorial).

There is a pretty good caf\u00e9 with food and beverages.My only downside (why I didn't rate a 5 star) was the fact that everything is enclosed - there are no open-air spaces to let you take unobstructed pictures. So you have to deal with greasy fingerprint stains on the glass in your pics. Also, the downtown location of the building means that you don't really see detailed views of the iconic Central Park.I'm glad that I experienced One World Observatory.

They will also almost force you to take a picture which they want to sell you at the bottom. We skipped all the sales pitches and went to the view.

The lines move quickly and in an organized fashion. However, it is quite pricey and then there are several ways that the experience tries to entice you to spend more money. Of course there are photos for a price and a gift shop at the top. When we went it was a very hot summer day and for security reasons were not allowed to bring inner own water - well at the snack bar - it cost 5.00 for a regular size bottle of water. You can see forever, but unless you spend the extra 15.00 to rent an iPad that tells you what you are seeing, you don't really know. So yes, a nice experience but I think it is over priced -"

Of course originally it was at the other towers. Needless to say we had a strong emotional attachment to the original World Trade Center. The views are magnificent of course. An interesting elevator ride was appreciated.But, it become just another tourist site when you get there. We so missed the beautiful restaurant that was once a part of the experience that has been replaced by something you can see at any airport. For something so special it stooped to selling overpriced t-shirts and the usual tourist trappings. It was dramatic of course but so very sad."

Keep your camera ready when you enter the elevator to take some pictures of the very creative movies they display on the screens at the elevator's walls. And keep your camera ready also after you have left the elevator and have to wait in a line in front of a wall which serves as a screen for a little intro show and then surprisingly opens and gives you free sight to the city below. Even on the two main decks you can take pictures from inside only through the window glass. The ambient is modern and quite noble. There is enough space upstairs so I never had the feeling that it was crowded - a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. Take the offer to loan a notepad (15 US $ extra charge): It displays the buildings and landmarks you are aiming at and if you touch on a detail it zooms in and displays useful Information about it. There are two giant rings of screens; do not miss the show that one of the very friendly staff members presents there from time to time."

Even they ride back down is enjoyable. It's similar to the Sears Tower in Chicago as you're inside looking out windows.

There was no wait when we were there yesterday - no wait to buy the tickets (830am) and no wait at noon for the visit. Take time to hear the workers describe what it was like to build One World. The elevators are fast - easy trip to the top. When you get to the top its a little odd - you actually have to go down a level to walk all the way around the observation area. They line you up to take a group photo before you go down a level. (Expensive). We also didn't rent an iPad but many people did - helps you identify what you're seeing as you look out the windows. The views are spectacular - esp of Ellis Island and Liberty Island (Statue of Liberty). Great views of midtown. HOWEVER last summer we went to \"Top of the Rock\" and I have to say if I was picking between the 2 buildings, I'd do the Rock - primarily because you see all of Manhattan including Central Park. One World had great views except the tall midtown buildings prevent you from seeing anything past that area (no Central Park). Lastly, there was a gentleman providing some history about NewYork - worth listening to if you're interested in learning geographic, demographic details)"

There is also a place to eat & drink if you so chose. Also a place to buy your tchotchkes to take home & there is quite an array.

We rented it but were disappointed with it because quite a few of the things that we were looking at that we wanted to know what they were, weren't included in the landmarks. It's also sketchy when you calibrate it...for instance we were pointing it at the Empire State Building but that building was not in the frame of the iPad. So we re-calibrated it and it was still off. Also, the information it did give on places wasn't as detailed as I was looking for. Personally I just didn't think it was worth more than about $5.

Once at the top there is a short video before you enter the main observation area. There are iPads available to hire to help identify landmarks, which seemed like an expensive gimmick to be honest.The 360 view was really amazing, you could see for miles! We were lucky that it was a clear and sunny day. However, taking photos wasn't easy given everything is behind glass so reflections everywhere. The glass could also do with a clean, so many finger prints....The lack of outside access to an open air section was the biggest disappointment. I guess I expected the same as at the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock. It would have been much nicer to be able to take photos without reflections.

It is a nice view from the like 101st floor especially The Empire State Building, actually you had a great view of everything!Hope you enjoyed."

The whole experience is very good and the different parts are well done.They offer a concept with IPads which show you additional information on the view depending where you stand and in which direction you look. This concept is quite unique and a well thought application. Therefore there are no information panels where people queue in front. The observation deck does have a lot space. It is well worth a trip up as it offers a different view than the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock."

Fantastic 360 views all around albeit through glass. Central Park not visible at all so you'll need to complement this visit with one to Rockerfeller and/or Empire State for that. Some views looking down to street level and into the pools of the twin towers spoiled a bit by by reflections.Over a couple of visits to NYC, I've visited all of the 3 observation sites but if choosing just one of them I would recommend you consider this one though."

I know everyone will think this is the best view ever too, situated in downtown. I have been to the Empire State Building and almost twice to the Rockefeller Centre. Both of these attractions were amazing. Unblocked views of the entire Manhattan skyline with an open space. You can experience the natural breeze, soak in the skyline with fresh air. One world observatory is unfortunately glassed up. It is likely to be for security reason, but think of the an avid photographer's nightmare at night ->you will see reflections of myself and everyone else against the glass. I was up from 6.30pm onwards and the sunset created such harsh lighting with reflections that you can hardly take anything without seeing yourself. Truly a bad experience for photographer. The only plus point is that you can take the Statue of Liberty at a much closer range than the other two vantage points."

We stopped at the lounge to enjoy an adult beverage and were greeted with friendly staff. Drinks were very expensive and 18% gratuity was automatically added.

On the screen in front of me, I saw as we got close to the top, the Twin Towers appear on the screen, and then they just dissolved, disappearing. A very quiet reminder of what happened.At the top it was just wild how far you could see.Wilder, still, was how you can actually feel the building moving. (all skyscrapers have several feet they sway) I've never been that high up in a building that needed to have that type of flex, so it was weird to feel it. It almost felt once in a while like I'd drunk one beer, and just felt a little bit of disorientation. There is a restaurant at the top of the building, so we sat and ate and looked around at New York from 1,700 feet in the air. It was really nice. The food was good.

Well\u2026 after waiting many, many months, we finally took the plunge and went up to see the new One World Trade Center. Everyone knows where this is and how to get there, so I won\u2019t get into that. I took up an offer on Living Social for discounted admission ($24/person ~ which is still a lot) and trooped over to the famous landmark, armed with a camera and plans to have a drink at one of the top-level (physically speaking) restaurants in that towering edifice and get some stunning photographs. Thing is, you can\u2019t get into the tower without paying the steep ticket price which starts at $32.00 just to get in the door, even if you were going there to have dinner at one of the high and highly overpriced restaurants/eateries there ~ which is ridiculous and just a way to fleece the public. It\u2019s a shame that the developers and operators of this site where so many innocent people were murdered, should use its infamy to capitalize on and fill their pockets... this is a crass exhibition of unbridled avarice. This place does bring back the views lost when the Twin Towers fell, but other than that, its also a pilgrimage site: my last visit to these rarified environs was in July 2011, just a few weeks before tragedy struck 15 years ago, and seeing that view of downtown New York City and its bridges brought back those memories.While its true that the gimmicky, really fast ride to the \u201ctop\u201d in an elevator with LCD screen walls that show changing vistas of the outside as it grew from a jungle into present day New York City are a great idea, and well executed, there isn\u2019t anything else there other than just another tourist trap to fleece the unwary traveler at every turn, from arrival (the photo-stop) till one leaves (the souvenir shop), and the many recordings telling everyone that \u201cyou are at the top of the tallest structure in the western hemisphere is highly misleading: first of all, you are not at the top, as the top of the needle or whatever you may call it, which is above the entrance level from the elevators, is not open to the public.To quote from \u201cA glimpse of the world\u201d in the New York Times, 2013 ~ \u201cHeights like these are usually measured with a rubber ruler. But according to the Port Authority, the 102nd or top floor of the observatory is 1,268 feet above the street, making it the third-highest observation deck in the Western Hemisphere. It would rank below the CN Tower in Toronto, at 1,465 feet; the Skydeck at Willis Tower in Chicago, at 1,353 feet; and above the Empire State Building, at 1,224 feet.\u201dAnd adding a pointy steel-thingy that can\u2019t be inhabited to the rooftop and calling it needle, spire or tower doesn\u2019t increase the height of the building itself, no matter what any Council says... that\u2019s just measuring with a carnival barker\u2019s (aka Donald Trump\u2019s) ruler and shabby posturing.It took them long enough to work through their petty squabbles and get this built, and it shouldn\u2019t be used for their greed. Yes, the views are unparalleled in this area, BUT the internal reflections in the glass, of the lobby lighting and visitors, mars the photographic opportunity completely. What a monumentally foolish choice for glazing ~ what a wasted opportunity\u2026."

The only thing that was a downer was that our group felt like they were always trying to make more money from us. a picture of everyone after you have entered where on the way out they try to sell to you. A IPad to use while looking out at the scenary so you can identify each building you are looking at, an additional cost. On the ride up in the elevator an video surrounds you explaining the progress of the tower over time. Great visual during the ride up and down. Overall a great experience for the views."

            "review": "Best viewed from the outside. We'd decided to visit One World Trade toward the end of a nine-day vacation in New York City, which, in hindsight was a mistake. If I can proffer other travellers one solitary tip, it's to arrange it as close to your arrival in Manhattan as possible. I say this simply because, if the weather isn't optimal, and you need to change your booking because of that, having the maximum number of possible days and timeslots available will likely make the difference between an enjoyable trip and a less-than-enjoyable visit.Our plan was to visit the One World Trade observatory the day before our last day in Manhattan, and that's what we'd booked for. However, between booking and visiting, the weather forecast changed and what had been expected to be brilliant sunshine when we'd booked had changed to rain when the day arrived and we knew when we walked toward the tower that we were going to have to rearrange given that we could only see the lower half of the building as we approached from our hotel in nearby Tribeca. Rearranging was effortless, even if the person who served us was a little disinterested, and we moved our booking to the following day at 0900. As a sidenote, we'd booked for a Friday and ended up visiting on a Saturday, which I think was more expensive, but we still paid Friday prices.The Saturday began with brilliant New York sunshine, and we schelepped down to the line optimistically, only to be told that there was zero visibility from the observatory and that we could rearrange if we wanted. Hence my sagely advice above: by this point we had no more days that we could rearrange this for, and so we just had to suck it up.While it might be the case that our experience was somewhat less impactful because of the lack of visibility, the four of us left feeling a little disappointed by the whole thing. Granted, the elevator to and from the observatory was incredible, but I thought the video pre-show they play once you've walked out of the elevator was a bit weak, and I absolutely loathed the hard sell for the iPad experience that you were then needlessly subjected to. However, I think this may be the only way to access the Jay McInerney-narrated tour, and I'm a massive McInerney fan - but even with that as a draw, I was never going to shell out for it, plus the chatter coming from people's iPads as they walk around the observatory zooming in on landmarks is incredibly irritating.Even with zero visibility, we could make out a dim silhouette of the Empire State Building by the time we left, and we had perfect views of the Financial District, the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, the Hudson River Park and Tribeca. This was our locale for our trip, so it was, in many ways, nice to see our neighbourhood from an entirely different perspective. We could identify our hotel and many of the buildings around it, and I've no doubt that the cathedral-esque grace of the Woolworth would be breathtaking in a completely new way if the roof hadn't been covered with construction sheeting and scaffold.While it's nice to say we've been up that high, looking back now I'm reminded of the advice that we were given before we booked to visit the observation deck of the Rockefeller Center compared with the Empire State Building back in 2012 - Manhattan is best viewed, not from the highest possible vantage point, but from slightly lower down. That's why, for this reviewer, One World Trade is something best viewed from the outside."

Once the elevator doors open, you're treated to a two minute visual presentation of New York. Then the screen rises and WOW, you see New York from 100 stories up! You can buy a skip the line ticket on line for around 50 bucks but if you go on a weekday in the morning you probably can get your ticket for around $34 and walk right in.

Because it is glass and mirrors, it reflects the sky around it and blends in magically. The elevator ride is memorable; so clever to move from beginning to end. And if you are anticipating a reference to 9-11, don't look for it here. WT1 is about the present, not the past. It is also about selling you stuff. The commercial aspect of it sort of diminishes whatever meditation you might have stored away for the event. I much preferred Rockefeller's top view to this one."

We arrived at 7pm and went straight through to the elevators - make sure you face the walls and not the door. Arriving at the top we did not bother with the hire of an iPad, we simply enjoyed the spectacular views, watching the sunset. Once you are up there you can stay as long as you like until closing time so no pressure.The food and drink selection was poor. The dining area is a real waste and badly laid out. We were offered a seat at the bar looking at the wall of drinks. The designers could learn from the Fernsehturm in Berlin about laying out a dining/bar area.The views are partly obscured by the reflections on the glass and some of the window panels are irregular making the taking of photos a bit hard.The souvenir area is a waste of valuable space and could be better placed at the exit as most museums do.All in all a really good experience but not 5 stars"

It disappears like part of the Imperial Battle Fleet. We booked using MasterCard (saves money esp for the peak time using their promo). No problems re queues. The lift up us an awesome NY timeline. The way down is like the Great Glass Elevator. They have mini iPads where you can zoom in on views. Ok but about \u00a310 a spin so one per large family enough as you'll spend plenty long enough up top. There's a good cocktail lounge with views for the romantic and separately a cafe next door with hot chocolate. Sunset is a great time to go as you get the best of both worlds. See my review of the Empire State to compare. In my book if you have to do one of the two do this. The ESB looks dated, rather than classic, in comparison. (Didn't do the Rockefeller though).

We went at night and it was a slight overcast but, we enjoyed it and it was no one there. It's better than being crowded with people. The employees are super nice and courteous, I almost felt like I was at a Disney park lol.Great informative things to listen and learn. And a great place to take the kids. That elevator ride is history itself. It shows the development underground up and through the years and centuries! We all enjoyed it and the little one enjoyed running around free being we were like the only ones to be in there that evening.Nice place to stop if you're visiting or even if you're from here.

At the top there is area couple brief presentations (skip the presentation that tries to get you to lease you an iPad for $15 if you want), then you are free to explore the two story observatory which contains a gift shop, snack bar and restaurant. Unlike the other two observatories in NY (Rockefeller Center and the Empire State) this one is indoors. That is one of the downsides as you can get a lot of glare from the windows that might interfere with the \"perfect shot\" you are looking for with your phone. The other downside is with the position of the windows in the structure, if you are looking for a good picture of uptown Manhattan or the Brooklyn bridge, that can be a challenge, but it is doable.Wait times were not too bad, perhaps 15 minutes (I went mid-morning). Security was airport style, nothing too difficult. They have some guides at the top that give interesting lectures, and for first-time visitors to New York you can learn some facts about the building and the city in general. The views are very nice, and while it is a bit pricey, I found it worth it to say I have done it once. Highly recommend it.Tip: While there are certainly other things that should garner your attention first in the World Trade Center area (Memorial first, museum second, then the observatory), after you come back down from the observatory ask for directions to the Oculus. While not quite finished, it is open to the public to see now. It is the new World Trade Center transportation hub which is breathtaking inside. Once you see it, you will think Grand Central Station is small! Highly recommended to go see the Oculus, and it is free!"

Once at the top you can get a professional photo done ($20) or skip that and walk down to the 101st floor where you can see 360 degree views of NYC and NJ. Very breathtaking and you can take some great photos. They also offer a tablet PC ($15 rental) that you can point at buildings and find out info about them.

Try to buy your tickets online and avoid the initial crowds. There is also a small discount for doing so. You get a brief history on the way to the elevators that will whisk you to the 103 floor. The short ride (45 seconds) is entertaining as there is a projection on the elevator walls that shows the city skyline changing from the 1920s to the present. You would think the elevator has a glass window. When you get to the top the view is spectacular with floor to ceiling glass walls. There is a bar and restaurant at this level. It is a bit pricy as you would imagine but you enjoy an unprecidented view. A short flight of stairs takes you down to the prime viewing area where you can walk 360 degrees around. You can spend as much time as you want. There is a short demonstration you can take or leave and there were a few building experts roaming around to answer questions. A souvenir shop is also located on this level. When you are done it is back down the elevator with another presentation on the walls. Before you know it you are back on the ground floor. Did not even pop an ear drum on either the up or down it was so smooth.

Maybe go earlier in the day to avoid this. It is orchestrated from the start from the ride up in the elevator, the introduction video and introduction to the iPads (more money). It spreads across a couple of floors, 100 - 102 for the viewing areas. I preferred the Willis Tower or John Hancock 360 in Chicago over these, but if in New York only, give it a view."

It wasn't complete the last time we were in NYC so we did the Empire State Building that trip. It's a toss up which I prefer more after going up to the top of One World. The Empire State Building offers an open air experience which is pretty neat. One World does not. That said, the admission price and lines were less for One World and we really enjoyed it. The use of various technology from start to finish was impressive. The elevator ride up was super cool!!! They also offer iPad curators for $15 that our whole family enjoyed. At first I thought it was a gimmick, but decided to try one and am so glad we did. As you hold it up and pan an area, it highlights many attractions/buildings/neighborhood areas and some you can zoom in on and it gives you a bird's eye view of it. Really cool technology and we learned about a few new things and added a few items to our must do list this trip.Overall, I'd add this to your list of must do's the next time you visit NYC!"

The interesting facts in the rocks is nice and the entry point video is cool. We rented one iPad for the group and not sure we found it to be all that helpful and a bit frustrating to understand. The views were great, bathrooms were clean. The elevator is surprisingly fast and involves entertainment as well. Nice.

Very smooth and fast, you are completely distracted by the full size monitors on the walls showing you the timeline of New York City from prior to settlement through today. A brief glimpse of the original towers as you realize their short lifespan from the 1600's until now. We went around 5pm for around $37 per person but the price goes up for sunset at 7pm. We ate at the restaurant which seems like it would be a tourist trap but the food was unexpectedly good although over priced. A great way to relax even if just for a cocktail at the bar. The only drawback was the loudspeaker on the floor beneath the restaurant of the guide giving a tour."

That's one expensive view but worth doing once. We went on a Saturday in July, the highest season you can find. So the line was looong. We skipped it to walk around the area and have lunch. Before leaving, we check the line again, and, lo, it had vanished almost. So up we went. (Note that if you pay with a credit card, you jump the line inside the lobby.) I thought there would be a crowded space at the top where we would be herded quickly through. Wrong. There is a spacious circular observation deck where you can spend as much time as you like. There is also a cafe. Nothing is cheap. The prices are as high as your perch. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide a spectacular view in all directions year round (weather permitting, of course). There will be days when you can be lost in the fog of a cloud, but you'll know that simply by looking for the top of the building. If you can't see it, don't go up. In a nice touch (literally), before you enter an elevator to ascend to the observatory, you get to see the Manhattan schist bedrock that holds up all the skyscrapers of the city. At the top, there are people who explain some of what you see. That is worth it for tourists who don't know the area. If you're a local, you can skip that and just drink in the view."

And the view from THIS building is far better than what we had at the World Trade Center. Even as you take in the view, however, the fact that others saw this same vista on 9/11 is ever-present.From the much-talked-about elevator ride that displays, in less than a minute, how Manhattan Island began and grew, to the step into the observatory, the experience is unique. When you look down on the rooftops of all of the other buildings, nearby and farther away, you clearly see what a marvel this structure is. What engineering and architecture! It's a fitting place for such a grand building!There are just a few things that might be reconsidered: 1) The lame, lame, slideshow that you're forced to watch could be dropped completely and we'd be none the worse for it. I suspect this is some type of \"entertainment\" while you wait to get into the observatory but it's just not necessary; and 2) The commercial pitch to rent an iPad. Granted, the iPad gives you more information but the few people I saw trying to use it, it seemed that it was an impediment to the actual view. It would be better if they just added a guide along the bottom of the windows, pointing out which buildings you're looking at and what's in the distance. Maybe the iPads just need more work but I say low-tech would work just fine. 3) There was some person talking about the area -- it sounded like a TV show host. Since I didn't pay attention, I'm not sure what they are doing there but it's some type of presentation. Why that is necessary is beyond me!There's one more thing that might bother some who get dizzy easily: The elevator ride down shows buildings swirling around you as if you're going down a drain -- but they swirl first one direction and then in the opposite direction. It's a short ride but could bother some -- just so you know.The cost might seem prohibitive but this experience is incomparable. If you spring for the annual pass, you get a couple of guest passes, which would be a nice treat for friends or relatives.This should be on everyone's \"must see\" list for NYC"

Not only do you travel up an elevator that takes you from the year 1500 to the present in a matter of seconds, once you reach the top, it is spectacular! The views are breathtaking and it's a 1st class attraction all way round. We opted for the VIP tickets which just saves a bit of time waiting in lines, though I don't think those lines looked all that long, so you may be just fine with the regular admission. But do go, it's worth it!"

Observation deck is completely enclosed and gives you a 360 view of the city. Breathtaking views make it worth the $35 price tag. It's definitely worth it if you're visiting the city and won't get a chance to see the skyline in another way."

I also thought the building from the outside was extremely impressive, but the inside left my wanting more. The elevator ride shows the changes of the city from thousands of years ago until today, which was very cool, but also extremely fast. It was over before we knew it. The views were nice, but I personally enjoyed the view from Top of the Rock much more. Go here if you want a good view of lower manhattan, (it is the tallest building in the western hemisphere we were told) and you are able to see 60,000 buildings below you. Not enough places to sit, if you wanted to take a break, and the souvenirs were very pricey in my opinion. It is a very pretty building though."

We also used our mastercard to get VIP entry - don't forget to do so. Plan to eat elsewhere as the food and drink costs are very high. The elevator ride is fantastic with a video timeline of NYC as you travel upwards. The 'reveal' of the view is breathtaking and then you're free to go around and around taking in the skyline. My bigget criticism would be the dirty handprints all over the windows and the reflections on the glass of the metal 'skyline' at the base of the windows. These made taking photos very difficult in some places. Other than that, it is worth the money for the incredible vista spread in front of (and below!) you. I'm scared of heights and was concerned whether I'd cope but had no problem with this at all."

The high-speed elevators take you up to the 102nd floor in just a few seconds, while you are distracted with a video that makes it appear you are looking out over Manhattan. The introduction to the observation deck is dramatic and the 360 degree view on a clear day is magnificent! The food court is quite modest, considering the volume of visitors and the offerings, acceptable but not great. Avoid the iPAD being offered as a guide to what you see. It is minimally informative, unless you know absolutely nothing about the city. In addition, it keeps re-setting, so you need to fiddle with it continuously to bring it back to the view you are looking at. The gift shop detracts from the spiritual meaning of this monument, which shold be a memorial to the fallen, and not an opportunity for the greedy."

Views stunning as before except there is no outdoor viewing point meaning photos have reflections of other people on them. The film shows in the lift in both directions were interesting as was the first 'reveal' of the view."

Currently the tallest building in the western hemisphere and sixth tallest in the world, the trade centre should be on everyone's travel list when visiting NYC.Before entering the centre, do take time to look at the memorial fountains in the footprints of the old twin towers, which show the names of those who so tragically lost their lives. Although tinged with sadness, this has become a calm, poignant memorandum to that day in September and well worth a look.I pre-booked the observatory tour online (that morning) to get tickets at a set time \u2013 around 45 mins before sundown for us. There was a special 'Date Night' on offer which included two glasses of prosecco and chocolate truffles to share along with the regular tickets. This was perfect as it was my wife's birthday and a great added extra.We arrived at around 6.30pm, spent time around the memorial fountains and then headed into the trade centre making sure we had enough time to meet our time slot. There were no queues and we went through the obligatory photo shoot to get to the elevator. This was something else. The 40 second ear-popping ride was really smooth. The elevator had large LCD screens showing the construction timeline of the city around us, shooting forwards in time as we reached the top floors. I thought that was a really nice touch and probably one of the best elevator rides available and a great introduction to what was to come.We were gathered behind a viewing rail to what looked like a giant wall which then opened up to show the amazing view outside. We were so high up, looking out over this extraordinary panorama. It was amazing. Afterwards, we took a short escalator ride up another level to where we sat down at the bar area for our free drinks and truffles. They had ran out of those but the nice lady behind the bar fetched us a good-sized piece of chocolate cake to share! We then sipped prosecco, watching the sun going down over New Jersey. It was a magical birthday and my wife loved it.I would recommend this to anyone visiting the city."

Having visited The World Trade Centre back in 2000, this was an emotional experience as memories of 9/11 were with me on this visit. The proximity of the Reflecting Pools is also a sad reminder - but very beautiful.So, the new building is, of course, very impressive up close and the handling of tourists seems well organised and efficient. We paid extra for the 'fast-track' which made it very expensive, but it was a hot day and we didn't want to queue outside too long.I found the staff rather brash and insensitive to the reason why this building is here. At every turn, you are greeted by young people trying to sell you something all done as if they are auditioning for a Broadway show. It's like organised sugging (though the approach is informative, the payoff is always that they want you to spend more).The 'reveal' at the top is impressive though I do wonder why the feel the need to prevent you from seeing out of the windows in certain areas. Of course, the views are amazing and New York is truly beautiful seen from this perspective. You can walk right up to the full-height windows and get some great photographs and you don't feel as if you're being hurried.I personally prefer the view from The Rockefeller Centre, but would recommend a visit to One World Observatory providing you book in advance and try to get the best deal."

The views from here are by far the best, everything can be seen. I also like the viewing platform they have on the floor, with video screens which shows the roads with cars driving. Its like you are standing on a glass roof. The only reason why I have not given 5 out of 5, its the ridiculous pricing at the bar.

We got there around 12 and preordered tickets. This expedited lines in the beginning. After going through security and up a really cool, interactive elevator, we got to the top and the true experience begins. A small video and amazing sights. This is truly a fun experience and well worth the money. There were minor waits to get back down, but nothing crazy. If you are local or a visitor, I highly recommend this attraction. A truly out of this world experience!"

I took my son into NYC for his birthday and he loves skyscrapers so he was excited as well. I booked the tickets online very easily. I spent the extra money to get the express passes because I did not know how long the lines would be and since my son has ADHD, I did not want to be waiting in long lines. When you buy the tickets online, you have to select a time, which is different then the Empire State Building, which does not require a time slot. We arrived and immediately bypassed the first line of people buying tickets onsite. Because we had the express pass, we were given wristbands so we could bypass the lines. But the lines were not very long so was there much time saved, probably not. They lines seemed to move more swiftly than at the Empire State Building. The elevator ride up was completely awesome...I don't want to give it away but it was one of the coolest parts of the trip. As soon as you get off the elevator, they usher you into a room for a short movie, then to another room to try to sell you their iPad rentals (no thanks!) and then off to the observatory. Very spacious, lots of room to move around. They had a guy giving a presentation but we did not sit around for that. They also have a souvenir shop, snack bar and full service restaurant available. Pros - the views are magnificent. Never felt cramped or was never waiting too long to get a particular view. Cons - It's all inside, which is not terrible in the middle of summer in mid-90 degree heat but the outdoor deck is what draws you to the Empire State Building. The snack bar food was AWFUL! I got a BLT wrap and my son got a grilled cheese plus two bags of chips $30. My wrap had (and I almost hate to say this) but too much bacon. I couldn't even eat half of it. So would I recommend it...sure. It's a bucket list place to go. I would probably go back one more time to take my daughter but other than that, I am good. Been there, done that..."

If you are wanting to go later in the day I would recommend buying them online that way you won't have to wait in line for as long. Both elevator rides were pretty cool with the video screens. Once upstairs they play a video that builds the suspense and then you get to see the view. I recommend wearing dark colors this day because light colors reflect off the glass and then you see yourself in the picture instead of the view. The view was awesome even through that day we went was slightly cloudy you could still see everything."

You are then greeted with a fantastic video culminating the the reveal of the best view in New York.Ushered through into the next room, you are offered the option to rent an iPad which gives information on certain buildings when you point it at them out of the 360 degree viewing window. A cool idea and at only $15 it seems worthwhile. Having rented the iPad we soon discovered that there are guides on the top floor that are very knowledgeable about the surrounding buildings, and whilst a cool technological piece, the human guides trump the iPad.Watch out for Fontaine, he is a particularly fantastic fellow in the observatory and knows everything you could possibly want to ask. He also has some great personal stories to share. It seems expensive at $37 but honestly well worthwhile.Only thing that would be better is if they offered family pricing discounts."

Perhaps if you are going for the sunset, it would help, but we just walked right to the ticket counter with no wait. The presentation from start to finish is excellent, well thought-out and beautifully done. From the visitor statistics at the entrance to the walk through of the foundation stone model to the videos going up the elevator - everything was fabulous. The presentation at the top was truly the best and then you get to wander for as long as you like, looking at the amazing views. Even at the top, they had interesting video presentations and plenty of people walking around to help you find landmarks, etc. I would highly recommend this as a whole NYC experience not to be missed."

Security check was like an airport, but was efficient. The elevator ride up was very quick and showed the development of NYC landscape over time-very impressive (wish I could do this again-it went too fast- should have videoed it!). There was a short film when you arrived at the top, which was really more of a lead in to the spectacular city view (at the end of the film, the screen went up and there was the amazing NYC skyline). We had purchased the iPad option in advance (one iPad for the family of 4), which was very convenient to have done ahead of time and we did not have to wait like the crowds who had just come up the elevator to purchase. Had to work out some family sharing rules, but one iPad worked for the four of us.The iPad was good to orient you to where the points of interest were located. I found it very helpful. There were also some videos on the iPad about some, but not all, the points of interest displayed on the iPad screen. The city view displayed on the iPad changed to your current view as you moved around the large observatory with 360 views. One World is likely the best observation point in NYC as you can see so many points of interest including Lady Liberty and Ellis Island clearly from here (we have previously been up the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock).There were also short interpretative talks on the city skyline going on periodically during our visit for free. We stopped to listen to some, and they were interesting, but honestly if you are interested in knowing and understanding the NYC skyline, the iPad was way more convenient and helpful.We had lunch in the cafe ( there is both a cafe and a sit down restaurant at the top). The cafe is cheaper than the restaurant, the food we good. Points to know: the cafe has only stand up tables to eat at, but with an amazing view. Also, a bottle of water was close to $5, so we got minimal drinks here and rehydrated after we exited. I found the food price was Ok, pizza the size of a dinner plate was about $12-$13.Our family really enjoyed our visit."

Its free wife, you can borrow ipad for free on that floor showing more about one world observatory, there is small coffee shop and of course payable picture's man will take ur picture.The view is 360, you can see New Jersey and Bronx from there also Liberty.

We went at 8pm and it was perfect. 5. Have your video cameras ready for the elevator ride up to the observatory. 6. Allow 10-20 minutes to walk from the Fulton subway station. 7.

I'm positive that everyone else with me was thinking the same thing.When I came back down the elevator almost immediately after getting back up...

The standard timed tickets worked fine. The attraction is very organized. Everything went smoothly and all of the staff were friendly and helpful. I did find it a little annoying that we were corralled from one holding area to another several times before reaching the observatory. In particular, I did not care for the narrow dark bedrock hallway at the beginning of the attraction. I am not especially prone to claustrophobia, but I did feel a bit claustrophobic anyway, winding slowly through this area. I also was annoyed with the holding area just before being let loose in the observatory where we received a mandatory sales pitch for the ipad rental. Just let us into the observatory already!

I was hoping this would be something special to be worth the hefty price, but now having been I'd have to say it's overpriced, although still obviously a must-do, regardless of cost. At $37 for a single visit, this compares very poorly with $21 (online, no time restrictions) for two (both day and nighttime) visits to the 94th floor in Chicago's John Hancock building. The lift up is good, with a full height and width video showing how Manhattan has grown over the centuries, then you step into a short video presentation which ends with the wall lifting to reveal Manhattan and Brooklyn below. Very impressive. Then you're herded into another room and forced to listen to a spiel to rent iPads for $15, but there were hardly any takers. Following that, you're free to wander down to the next level, where you can see the 360 degree view. I'd say this is the best high level view in Manhattan, as we find the Financial District more interesting from both historical and scenery perspectives. There are great views to the Statue of Liberty, Governor's Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, Greenwich Village and Midtown. One disappointing thing was the very significant amount of glare on the windows, spoiling many shots. Using a polarising filter didn't help, as it showed distortion in the glass, again spoiling shots. I'm not sure if I was unlucky, or if it's a design fault, but I don't remember having that problem in Chicago last week on an equally sunny day. In summary, it's a great viewpoint, but for that money I'd expect to have a second nighttime visit thrown in."

Due to the fact we had tickets already we skipped the queues, even though I wouldn't say the queues at that time were overly long. They scanned our tickets and allowed us in before our allotted time - no questions asked. The elevator to the top was amazing, it was so smooth and you reached the top in less than a minute. The videos they show you going up of New York and also the video coming back down was great. The views were amazing and the initial viewing in the Theatre where they 'unveil' the view is a nice touch. The only downside is the glass reflects quite a lot meaning you struggle to get any good photos. You often see reflections of other people walking behind you or the illuminated Exit signs which is a shame. Still it doesn't take away the amazing views you will be seeing."

However, the staff was upbeat and had some interesting presentations. The augmented reality iPads are worth it if you're unfamiliar with New York geography, history and/or architecture. Also, the elevators are pretty wild and make the time go quickly."

As you ascend, the walls of the elevator show the changes to the New York skyline over the years. The observation deck is fully enclosed with glass windows. It was quite cloudy on the day of our visit so the views over New York were not as good as those from the Top of the Rock and Empire State Building which we were able to go to when it was sunny. There are interactive media pads available to hire for $15 but they don't give very much additional information on the buildings that can be seen from the observatory. There is also a restaurant and small gift shop. The website says that admission is by timed ticket but due to the late finish of an earlier activity, we missed the time on the tickets (which had been bought beforehand to avoid queueing), but this did not seem to matter as the staff just waved us through."

We booked the tickets on the day of the visit to avoid waiting in lines and showed up at the required time to visit the observatory. However on arriving we were informed that there was 0 visibility. On requesting for a refund, they said they could provide a ticket for later date any time before the end of the year. We were visiting from LA and one does not travel to NY all the time. I suggest One World Observatory management should provide refunds in case of no visibility to win the people visiting to get the view from the tallest tower in USA. One must not be penalised for making online reservations and online reservations should provide that there will be 0 visibility at that specific time. Ethically, the user should be provided with all information at the time of booking and so that they can make the right judgement."

The views were alright but there is a terrible (cutesy) skyline cutout along the edge to prevent you from sitting, creating mobscenes around the good spots. The angle of the observatory glass is horrendous, and the reflection from the exit and display signs prevent you from getting ANY good photo. The gift shop takes up a huge chunk of the walking space causing traffic. Chaotic at best, though the presenters were fabulous, overall it was completely not worth it."

There are some fake (hollow) rocks to look at on the way in (like Disney rides!), the video in the lift and at the top is very well done.

From the Empire State Building you can see the WTC to the south, and also north to Central Park.The new WTC looks good from a distance, but up close the architecture is very plain and blah--even cold. And, surprise, if you want to know what you are looking at from up there they charge another $15 for an IPad that will locate the sights for you. The food court at the top is very poorly designed--the less expensive cafe has only bar height tables at which you have to stand to eat your $6 hotdogs and $5 sodas. The gift shop probably has nothing anyone would want to keep for longer than a day.Save your money or go to the Empire State Building."

The whole operation from door to observation deck was seamless with great security and organisation at all stages. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We were very impressed! The bar at the observation deck was open but this was the only down point in our visit. We bought a wine and a beer to enjoy whilst looking at the great views. We didn't realise that where we bought it was separate to the bar (the bar was behind a curtain). We asked our server if we could take our drinks into the bar and he said it should be fine but we were stopped by bar staff as they said they are separate franchises. That's fair enough but with no where to sit with our wine and beer we felt we had been dealt with unfairly. The observation deck and shop were both excellent and restroom facilities were clean and tidy. It was a fantastic tourist experience and one I would possibly do again!"

From walking into the building, meet & greet by staff who are proud to do their job to the amazing views of New York. We went early morning so no queuing at all. You were taken on a journey that was informative and enjoyable and paced just right without being hurried on to the next area. 47 seconds to rise to the 132nd floor was fast but you did not feel it, unbelievable. A cafe is available and you had the tourist sop up there too but I found it expensive for what it was. Some nice quality items but also some trash not worth the money in my view. On reaching the top you have a choice to rent an iPad so when you looked over New York it would highlight key tourist areas and buildings which you could select to give you more information on. I would suggest you visit the key sights before going to the observatory so you get that sense of proportion of where you have been. Do not miss this opportunity as it is well worth the money. We paid at the door and it was a good deal."

The views from the One World Observatory were amazing - we went a little before sunset but didn't stay until dark - I would definitely recommend this time period. Also we went on a Thursday to try and avoid weekend crowds and that worked well for us.The only negative is the amount of people that are there - it can be a challenge trying to look out of the window at times due to the throngs of people. But it is something to see."

I had not been back since 9/11 and had very high expectations. The ticket price seemed high but I assumed it would be worth it in the end, I was wrong. If you don't mind paying $37 to ride an elevator to the top of the tallest building in the city then One World Observatory is for you. Free tips for management: offer the IPad viewers for $5 per family instead of $15, drop the cost of water from $5 to $2 and send 50% of your staff home as they are unnecessary and ineffective. Don't force me to get my picture taken and for God and the victims sake have some sort of acknowledgement of what happened here. And one more thing, $20 per ticket is more than fair for free AC and a view to take pictures from. That is all for now!"

First of all, I'm going to refer to it as the 'Freedom Tower' because that was it's first name and that is what most New Yorkers call it and I feel they should have kept the name in the spirit of something new rather than changing it back to 'One World Trade Center' apparently for 'business reasons' Yes, it's expensive, yes there are queue's and yes, plenty of opportunity to spend even more money on all the incidentals (Ipad tour info, photo's, upgrade, etc etc) The thing is, you're only here once and the overall experience will stay with you forever. It's a fabulously impressive building and the views are breathtaking. They should have built two!!. We loved it and well worth the cost."

The lift takes you to 102nd floor in around 12 seconds which is amazing. The I pad device that they will persuade u to rent does not have a lot of significance unless u are really interested in the history of all the buildings in NY.

A time line of the building of Manhattan from the 1600s to date 'evolves' as the lift goes up. I wish we had the option of going up multiple times! The view is great, of course. It is very well organised. Everyone says so many things in NYC are a \"must\", but this IS a must. BTW, I ate at the One World Observatory and have written a separate review.

(best part of tour for me)then crew in the start will give you a short presentation about new york and after that when screen lift up and you see the NYC view, amazing feeling. they offer the tablet for $15 to know the all iconic building/places/park. it has inbuilt app in it and it will end your curiosity like what is that building, where is Chrysler building. so if you have a group, you can take it.and yes great sunset view. from the high rise building, it was y first experience.I had been to empire top deck so the comparison will come of course.Personally, I liked empire more as it was in midtown and you can see up/down town both. but from OWO, you can see manhattan outlines and midtown.still, fabulous experience."

We were not particularly fussed as to what time, so we picked 1.30pm and paid $136. You can imagine our annoyance when we discovered, later that day, that we could have had a Family Package for $105!! This made my blood boil as none of the ticket staff offered this package to us or made any suggestions to us to get our tickets at this price or if the Family Package came with any restrictions. They simply charged us for 4 standard tickets without asking us any questions. Not one of them was under any pressure with queues of people waiting in line behind us. When we arrived the following day, there was no customer service desk to be found and the feeling of being completely ripped off was fresh in my mind. However, we did our best to not let this cloud our judgement of the tour itself. We hired one iPad ($15) and shared it between us and this worked really well. The highlight for me was in the See Forever Theatre. I do not want to spoil it for you but all I will do is suggest that you have your recording devices at the ready.The staff at the City Pulse were charming and very helpful.

It made me very emotional too, I kept thinking about the lives lost on 9/11 and how it must have felt to be In a building of that height on that day and it being the reason the new building was erected. Well worth a visit"

I went a little later in the day (arrived about 1630), which was perfect as the crowds are starting to settle a bit, though still waited for about 35 mins to get into the lift. There is a moving video wall from the people who built the new tower, and then some information about it.The lift is amazing- I won't say anything more to not spoil it, but it like a potted history of NYC. Then there is another short video with an incredible ending. The viewing deck is just after that, where you can see the most fabulous views of the city (though we were blessed with a clear, sunny day). I would plan to spend a good hour up there taking in the views. Definitely worth a visit!"

From the moment you enter your experience begins even before you board the elevator. This is no mere elevator though, it actually is a historical visual educational experience from the bedrock below to top of the World. I will not reveal all we experienced during our ride as it would spoil the great surprises in store. Once arriving to the observatory the view is a jaw dropping experience filled with delight and amazement. Having visited what was \"Windows\" in the past I will say that is was a bit emotional for us all. Overall we where very glad to be there and all of the staff members where inviting and eager to answer any questions. To me though it felt more like a Disney World attraction than a ride up in an elevator to look at the view.Disney World is known for it's exceptional everything and a visit to One World Observatory is nothing less."

The elevator ride up is great - hopefully you don't get sick but the best view is to stand with your back to the elevator doors so you can see all 3 sides of the elevator.

Once at the top you are in for a treat - we visited our first morning so it was really our first look at the skyline & what an introduction it was! Don't want to spoil it for anyone who doesn't know what happens but believe me it is awesome. Then you are free to wander around the observation decks, all internal so photos all have an annoying glare. The iPad you can hire is pretty cool, it helps you figure out what you are looking at. The snack bar/cafe place wasn't up to much - as I mentioned we were there for opening time & wanted to grab breakfast at the top but they didn't have any bagels left (don't know who ate them since we were so early!) & no seats, just lean to bench things. There is a proper restaurant too but think it may only do lunch & dinner."

Yes, as others have mentioned, pass on the iPads as it's a quirky experience at best. The idea behind the iPads is to point our what you're looking at but it's a poor experience. Asking someone is more productive. But again, the views are amazing and why you should go!BUT, the dining experience put a bit of a damper on the visit. It was truly disappointing given it would be so easy to improve and, if not make memorable at least not detract from the whole experience. What's the problem? Well first I should should mention there are 3 options for dining but you need reservations for \"One Dine\", the top shelf facility. We didn't want that but still expected a decent lunch so that left us \"One Cafe\" or \"One Mix. Issues:1) My wife uses a wheelchair so although \"One Cafe\" fare looked good there are no chairs and high bar-type standing tables. So my wife would have had to eat her lunch from her lap. Not good. So we \"chose\" One Mix but..2) Service was slow despite plenty of staff and we waited and waited for our food, though others ordered the same meals and were served first. I asked about this but our waitress indicated the kitchen was behind, but again, others around us ordered the exact same meals and were served before us. Not good.3) The food was pricy and nothing special. Yes, I didn't go there for the food but again, so easy to improve upon.4) There's plenty of room but it's poorly used. We had to actually have 2 people at the bar pick up and move their chairs so we could get out the only exit from the dining area. Really? My wife's wheelchair is not that big - a travel model even. Again not good.So while the views are great as you would expect whoever is managing the dining operations should be ashamed. Such a great venue and yet such poor execution."

I paid a lot of money, stood in long lines just to spend 15-30 minutes walking around a crowded areas looking at the view.

Even the final point where you are looking around at the view is a richer experience.There are lots of interesting moments along the way to the top, and at the top the area is spacious and modern and comfortable. Also, you can rent a tablet that helps point out landmarks you are looking at and gives you some information and history about those landmarks.As always, it's recommended to buy your tickets in advance.

Whilst in Midtown, I prefer Top of the Rock over the ESB, the One World Observatory can't be beaten for this area of Manhattan. So, that's the views out of the way. Understandably, the One World Observatory is busy a lot of the time and there are a couple of areas in which the layout could be greatly improved to aid guest flow around the attraction.After going up in the lift (in which the AV is excellent), you enter a small movie theatre experience, however, once the film has been shown, the assembled people are then expected to exit via a bottleneck that is not very conducive to efficient guest flow. It's also counter-intuitive as those who are furthest to the right (where the exit is) have to move to the left first before then moving back to the right to exit. After the cinema experience, you enter another room where the team try and sell you the hire of an iPad to provide further insight as to the views, and again, after this area, there is a bottleneck for everyone to move through before reaching the observatory itself. It's definitely worth a visit because the views are unrivalled, but they could certainly do with a few changes to the flow of guests through the attraction itself. I'd also suggest a few more areas for people to sit too."

View is amazing and you can see for miles although its a little worrying when you realise helicopters are flying below the level you're stood on. What I didn't like and what lost points is the \" theatre\" In the lifts... a short video showing new york being built through the ages. Fine. .. but 45 seconds in a lift isn't long to take that in. Once at the top you then watch some \" random scenes of new york\" played on a screen which then moves away to dramatically reveal the view. Yawn. I don't want to see ground level shots of taxis and buildings. It was all very irrelevant. Then you're ushered away from the view to a room where they try and upsell you to rent an ipad with info about the view. We'd pre ordered one anyway but the price was the same and we still had to stand through the sales spiel before we could go anywhere. Once we had it it was mostly a pain in the rear as it was heavy and cumbersome, however if this is your first viewing it may come in handy to spot what's what. Some of the best views were totally obscured by more stands with people waffling on about the view. Again. So the view pointing directly towards central park and the rockafella centre etc was captured from one side rather than front on because they had stupid stands in the way. Please please. Just let people see the view and stop with all the extra junk. Overall the view from the top of the rock may be lower down... but damn. I enjoyed it more. We were left to our own devices there and didn't have to sit through what felt like loads of rubbish to see it."

Pros: Dramatic sweeping views of New York, 47 second, super speed elevator with fantastic video surround presentation, convenient to the 9/11 memorial site.Cons: Tourist trap ambiance, you must pay $47/adult (some package deals with other attractions give you dollars off) and run the gauntlet of the photographers taking/selling you pictures, the hawkers of the $15 Tablet app to help you find and interpret the landmarks, and giant souvenir stand.Tips: we went at nightfall, no line, actually had the elevator ride to ourselves. It was more difficult to take pictures through the glass due to the bright lights of the souvenir stand (created unwanted reflections). You can get food at the top if you want. Expect to spend about an hour at the top plus your line time.Overall: If you like this type of top of the world views or have this attraction as part of a package ticket, by all means see it!"

I went there just around the sunset and was fun to see all the architectures from up there - including the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. The best part was the sunset, I have never seen a better sunset over the backdrop of a city. It was great! The sun down and being towered by tall buildings. You don't get to spend too much time once it gets dark as it closes down pretty soon enough after the sunset. But whatever time I spent after the sunset was spent looking at great lighting across the city. The bridges particularly look marvelous.If you are not a history buff and want to avoid museums, this would be a great place to go to."

It's so peaceful at the top. And getting there is quite an experience; the walk to the elevator and the elevator ride itself are very informative. Once at the top, you're given the opportunity for $5 to rent a One World Explorer iPad to take a virtual tour of New York and it's iconic landmarks. I thought it was worth it, since this was my first visit to NY. All in all, I highly recommend, and the $30 price tag for the tickets is worth it."

Tickets are on the expensive side, approx. $35 for adults and $25 for kids 12 and under. I bought tickets on the day of my visit on line. Ticks on line are $3 less but they charge you a $3 service charge per ticket. Therefore, no real savings. Line to grab the elevator was short and minimal wait time, a few minutes. The ride up to the observation deck was amazing. I will not ruin the surprise, but be prepared to view images on all 4 walls of the elevator while riding to the top.?Very cool! Once up on top, a short video presentation and then one other surprise, also very cool. Once up on top, you will have great views of nj, lower Manhattan, mid town, Brooklyn and queens. No views of Central Park. One negative, the observation area is totally enclosed, unlike the Empire State Building, which offers an outdoor viewing area.

It was a very cloudy day and they warned us that there is zero visibility at the bottom before we bought our ticket. Since it was our last day in NYC I didn't care and wanted to have this experience. Last time I skipped the experience I missed out and never got a chance to see the Twin Towers.That said, I don't want to take away the surprise from future visitors so here are a few tips:1. If there is 0 visibility the day you visit, you can still go and get a few peeks if the clouds are moving but best of all the crowds were minimal. We went on a Tuesday afternoon around 5pm and we ran straight to elevator and the whole observation deck had MAYBE 50 people including staff. It was extremely peaceful if you are looking for a more meditative experience rather than viewing all of the skyscrapers.2. Eat before you go. They have food up there (sandwiches, pizza, coffee, etc) but of course very expensive. 3. If anyone in your party has motion sickness or afraid of heights, bring a plastic puke bag. None provided in elevator. I do not advice if anyone has a strong fear of heights. The observatory is enclosed but to pay that much money and have a strong fear may not be worth it. 4. I suspect the best time to go is after 5 pm, Monday - Thursday since all of the workers and early day tourists are gone.5. I can't speak to buying your tickets online but if you are on a tight schedule and have to plan, just know there is a chance of 0 visibility. They will exchange your tickets for another day at the counter."

Maybe because once you got up to the top it was such a magnificient view. The elevator ride up was fast with an interesting little twist. So great! Once you got up to the top there is a hallway you go down, that was probably the biggest disappointment. You are so ready for those views and as you are walking down the hall they have the windows all covered up. But they didn't disappoint once you got into the main area which is more than one story. They is a beautiful gift shop, restaurant, snack shop and bar. Awesome place, you go down an escalator to get to the views and they do not disappoint. There are people there who give very interesting observations on what this area used to be as compared to what it is today. Very knowledgeable . The lady that did the presentation for us had a PHd in Art History. She knew her stuff. And it was interesting in that you wanted to watch her. Beautiful building A must see!"

No where else, could you hear a needle drop in the middle of Manhattan.Last year the tower was opened and my cousins and I went, a long long line, but we had tickets for a time frame, and went up 103 floors in 43 seconds, we walked out on the top floor to shades hiding all the windows, until all the people holding the time frame we had. Again,silence, until the shades dropped and there was Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, New Jersey, Queens at our finger tips. The first emotion was to look at the city I grew up in, worked, played and then came tears. You never forget how we got to this place and the meaning of it. The view is spectacular, 360 degrees, and a 'AH' moments when you saw all the areas around the One World Conservatory.

As a result of this marketing strategy they have not put any info boards up in the actual observation deck. So it is a \"pay or guess\" system.I have been fortunate enough to have visited most of the \"tall observation\" decks around the world to take images and without a doubt this is the worse for reflections. From the fancy metal strips around the bottom of the panes to general reflections up the length of them the reflections are very intrusive. Mr World Trade Centre CEO, just pick up the phone to the designer and tell them that they have plain got it wrong.And at the time of my visit (13.00 approx) a lot of the windows had smears and other grubby marks across them that also messed up photo's. The windows had not been cleaned recently, this was not just visitors poking them that morning.Interesting views, just don't go expecting to get photographic \"keepers\".

We had visited Ground Zero in 2008, the Memorial Pools in 2012 as well as The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas in 2013. So this year, we felt a trip to NYC would not be complete without the experience of seeing a newly built One World Observatory. How disappointed we were to be subjected to the commercialization of the tour! We were expected to move into a photo-taking area to buy souvenir photos at the end, subjected to an uninspiring film about about NYC and the new building addition to NYC, offered a $15 rental of an iPad to review attractions as seen from the top deck, a restaurant, and of course, the gift shop. Not one mention was made of September 9, 2001. Meanwhile, we had purchased priority tickets online in advance, just knowing there would be long lines in June. What a waste of extra dollars spent not to mention the high cost of the lowest priced ticket; there were no lines! Okay, the view of NYC was spectacular on a clear sunny day, but don't expect that clarity every time. The only impressive thing about our visit was the EXIT where we viewed the uncompleted concourses of the building which will have shops and restaurants; it is a very magical design of white contemporary architecture. Plus, a new subway stop inside will be most convenient for workers and tourists alike. In summary, if you have money to burn and simply have nothing else to do in all of NYC, go ahead and waste your time at this attraction. Otherwise, love NY in so many other ways!"

Thankfully we just walked through. Then, you get to the elevator, and there are guides to get the right number of people on the elevators. Once inside, it's a very cool 360 degree view as you go up of the city being built up around you. It's fun! Once at the top, you have to listen to a short speech about the benefits of buying an iPad. We half considered it, but then we weren't in the mood to wait to buy the iPad. After that, they practically force you to have your souvenir photo taken for purchase later. THEN, you're almost there -- to the overlook. They have a lovely little cafe up there. There were two areas where guides were talking about famous New York sights. We were a family -- all adults.

It feels a bit like visiting Disney at first with the way they handle the lines and channel you through. The Apple Viewers they try to upsell as they channel you through are a good idea for being able to identify what all the sites throughout the city are as you take in the view. The upsell sales pitch was rather off-putting for us though. Once you finally get to the actual top viewing area you can truly take in every bit of the city. They have several stations where they have staff explaining some of what you are seeing and the history of the sections of the city. The view is great but not sure it's worth the high price tag."

The views from the Observation room are as expansive and wonderful as you'd expect. Our private event was evening to night so it was special to see the city lights come on. My one comment to management is to add more seating for private events. It is unreasonable to expect women in sky high heels to teeter for three hours. Our bar service was very good as was the food.

However, a friend of mine was up from Florida and very anxious to see the Observatory, so I went.This is one tourist attraction which I would happily recommend to anyone, including New Yorkers, like myself. It's exciting from the minute you enter the elevator for the 8 minute ride to the 100th floor. The glass elevators show fast changing photos of New York City and then, suddenly, they are gone, and you are looking at the most awe inspiring vista of the actual city ... all 5 boroughs. Although the day was overcast, we were able to recognize Long Island, Staten Island, the Catskill Mountains, and everything in between. To see the West Side Highway with ant-like cars moving north and south was amazing. We even spotted people in red uniforms playing soccer. We wouldn't have noticed them (they were so tiny) if not for their uniforms. The people who work there, including security, were very nice and helpful. The only thing that disappointed me, but I should have expected, is their attempt to sell: pictures, souvenirs, rent Pads to see what you could look out the window and see, etc.A little advice: Don't bother with the pictures (take your own) or $15 pads, but do have lunch in the 100th floor restaurant. The food was delicious and abundant, and the prices moderate by tourist attraction standards. We walked around the memorial pools, which was very touching, and then went to see the Brookfield mall, which was beautiful, and had drinks by the water. It was a lovely day all around."

Back on land we made our way inland towards the 9/11 memorial. After time at the pools ( a tranquil and fitting reminder of the atrocity that happened on that very spot) we made our way to the tower. Ticket queue was not huge and we where asked if we 'would be paying by card'..'Yes'.. 'Step out of the queue I'll take payment and you can go through..'.. I won't spoil the journey up but it's good.. 1 point is before you are allowed to wander and take in the views you are offered the rental of an iPad programmed with details of the city below.. Hired one and was disappointed .. So much so I handed it in early.. Personally I don't think they are worth the price. Our weather was sunny and the view superb.

They have lots of help and are very efficient. We rode the 102 story elevator to the top while watching a snapshot video of NYC from the early 1900's thru now. I was concerned that if I was looking out, the height would get to me but this was great. The observatory was wonderful and although it was an overcast day you could still see forever. My cousin and I of course went to the bar restaurant and had a glass of wine. Very beautiful. Enjoyed, however the gratuity was added and I didn't know it until I left a cash tip. Oh well. You need to look at your bill I guess. Anyway, the tower was well worth it."

The elevator ride is fast (be sure to pay attention to the time lapse photos happening on the walls of the elevator). The mobile device interface is great, and worth the $15.

On that visit, my family & then boyfriend (now hubby) went to the top of the World Trade Center. I remember being awestruck at the views below. On this trip I shared the experience with my husband and children. The views are still jaw dropping! We have been to the Top of the Rock & the top of the Empire State Building. Love them! But being able to see this city that I love from the top of the \"Freedom Tower\" is almost indescribable! After walking around the entire 360 degrees, we took a seat at the bar & had some drinks while drinking in the view! Pay attention in the elevator on the way up too. From beginning to end, I was blown away! Definitely worth the price of admission. I look forward to returning for a sunset view!"

We took so many picture's, and will treasure them for ever. We also ate in the restaurant above the observatory, and that was fantastic also. I don't see a review on Trip Advisor for the restaurant, however, I'd be happy to review and rate that if it ever shows.

One WTC is actually the first of the 4 (?) skyscrapers to be assembled around the fallen Twin Towers. Made of sterner stuff guaranteed to survive disaster or any terrorist attack , this is one sight to behold. The experience starts once you ride the ultra high speed elevators. It is literally a visual spectacle , then once you arrive at the top , it is like curtains open to breath taking scenery of the whole city. If you have time, take the interactive I-pad which costs you just a little below 20 dollars , but it would be worth it. And before going down , how about taking some snacks in their nice restaurant , and buying the souvenirs."

Its a bit dearer than some of the other attractions at 37 dollars for an adult but after visiting felt it was worth the cost. Going up in the lift was a wow as you climbed and on arrival to the top there is a short film that is very entertaining and then you get to see the views. Without spoiling it for those of you yet to go, but there was a round of applause from everyone as we got to see the views. You get a good look over 9/11 and different views from when you visit Empire etc. I think the drinks could be cheaper in the restaurant . We also decided to buy a picture and this was dearer having it sent to e-mail than printing out as we didn't want to carry it so think this could be improved but visiting this is a must do on your tick list is visiting New York. ."

I've been to this place twice and loved it both times!Going up, you pass through an exhibit featuring interviews with workers who helped put the building up, A replica of the bedrock that the building sits on, taking the form of a tunnel you pass through, and some other things pertaining to the history of the site.The elevator is where things really start to get interesting- you are surrounded by full size viewing screens, and as you go up, the image changes, showing the growth and evolution of Lower Manhattan- from nothing but trees and Native settlements to the modern city we all know and love. You even get a cameo appearance from one of the original WTC towers.After that, you get out and find yourself facing a three dimensional screen, which will show you a short (roughly 2 minutes long) movie about NYC. Then they do something awesome- that screen slides up into the ceiling and you're faced with the actual view, facing towards the Manhattan Bridge. The observatory itself has several levels offering a few different dining options, a gift shop with plenty of offerings, and of course, the gorgeous view itself. They've put in a few benches here and there, but overwhelmingly, people like to sit on the heating/AC units around the perimeter of the building. Once up there you can stay as long as you like, or until the place closes and they kick you out, whichever comes first! Do be advised that this place does close a little earlier than Rockefeller Center, or Empire State, especially during the winter months.Really, the only unfortunate thing about this place is that you can't go out on the roof- there's no outdoor space like the other observatories offer. That can make photography tricky, trying to avoid reflections from the glass and all. This is a great way to see Lower Manhattan, and it's unique in that regard- the competition is all uptown, clustered around Midtown."

The views from up top were stunning, but the price is a bit steep as mentioned a few times. The only criticism I can level is the desperation to grab money from you in every single way. Almost as bad as Orlando in that respect. Steep entry, then more cash to rent an ipad to tell you the names of buildings you can see, then more cash for a photo of you up there. Pricey stuff in the shop up top along with pricey food. Regardless, its a great place to go and I was happy with my visit. Just make it more reasonable in cost. One tip - book online and visit early as possible - so much quieter"

The guided tours and videos about various parts of the city were both entertaining and informational. The only complaint is about the cafe/restaurant... The people didn't seem like they really wanted to be there, and let it show by how they talked to people. The food itself was good, but it wasn't delivered with much friendliness. Overall though, this was an incredible experience. I won't forget the views and getting to learn some history too was great. I would absolutely recommend to any NYC visitor!"

The huge viewing area means everybody can look to their hearts' content. When we had seen enough the staff had us on an elevator going down quickly.

This was not cheap and cost us $85 each but it did give us expedited entry. We arrived for our visit and a member of staff greeted us and directed us to the expedited queue. We went straight through security and then through to the elevator. The trip up in the elevator was pretty good. We went up about 100 floors in what felt like seconds. The elevator turned into a video and as you went up it went through the years showing the landscape of New York and how it has changed over the years. Once we left the elevator we were shown a film of New York with lots of city landmarks on it. When it finished the screen went up and we got a glimpse of the skyline. Make sure you have your camera poised and ready as the screen comes down again pretty quickly. The doors then opened to access the viewing area. So at this point everything was really good and we were impressed and enjoying our visit. However, sadly this changed from this point onwards. As you go through the doors you are accosted by members of staff trying to get you to use an ipad during your visit to see where the landmarks are in the skyline. A nice idea - yes we thought so too and paid $15 to have this experience. You are not provided with any headphones so the narration just comes straight from the ipad. What they don't tell you is that there are two pulse sections in the North and South parts (where most of the landmarks are) and there is a member of staff with a microphone giving out information. We found that this completely drowned out the commentary from the ipad and it was a complete waste of time having it! The information being given in the pulse was actually really interesting so I would just go for that and avoid the ipad if I were you.The views were good but photos weren't great due to the sheer volume of people and the number of reflections making their way onto the photos!It was lunchtime when we visited so we decided to head to the cafe for a snack and a sit down to rest our feet. I really suggest that you don't bother and head to a cafe somewhere else instead. We had a drink each, a vanilla yoghurt and one almond croissant and one cup cake (which frankly I could have made a better one at home myself). This came to a staggering total of $33 - i.e. a right rip off. Even worse we then found that they had tables but no chairs at all so you literally had to stand up to eat. A bit naff really. We eat our overpriced and grossly under rated food and headed to get the elevator down. The journey down was as efficient as the journey up and the view this time was the one world trade centre. As we felt we had been ripped off we didn't bother to visit the shop.So in summary the view is good but avoid the cafe and the ipad!"

So, let me say begin by saying I do not mind spending money on exciting events, adventures, theater tickets, vacations, etc. Please don't misunderstand the title of my review as an indication that we are cheap. Initially, I did not blink at spending $100 for 2 adult tickets and one senior ticket. However, having gone to the One World Observatory, I can only hope to help others save some money. We took a cab because my mother-in-law would be unable to navigate the subway. The ride there and back to our hotel cost $38, which included the tips. When we arrived about 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon, the line was very short. We had a 2:15 reservation, and asked if we could go in early, which they allowed. We wove through a bit of the building, went through security that was a joke, and came to some elevators. The wait there was not very long either. As everyone has said, the elevator ride is pretty cool and creative. However, it lasts only 60 seconds, so don't go just for the elevator ride\u2026 Once we got off the elevator, we waited again for a bit to go into a \"theater\" with no seats. It was very shallow with a huge screen. However, we were so close to it and people were standing right in front of it, so it was difficult to enjoy the same way we would have if the theater had been deeper and with seats. This part lasted a couple of minutes and then we were shuffled into another holding pen. From reading Trip Advisor before I went, I knew this was going to be the iPad pitch, which I had no interest in, so we used this time to go to the restroom. When we came out, the pitch was over and we were allowed in. The first thing I heard and saw was a \"hawker\" yelling into his microphone about something he was showing on this giant wheel-type screen. All I could think of was a carnival barker. I have NO idea what it was about because I was SO turned off. I realize this is an observatory, and not the \"memorial\", but it still seemed extremely cheesy and out of place. When we finally moved into the area where all the windows were, I was pleasantly surprised to be able to move about the area quite comfortably, despite all of the people. We never had trouble getting to a window to look out, and yes, the view was great. However, the best is yet to come - since it took only about 20 minutes to weave through the lines to get upstairs, the elevators is constantly bringing people up. There are 5 of those elevators, and it was our observation that most people only spent about 10 minutes or so looking around, and then they were ready to go back down. When we went to get in line, we discovered the elevator line was hundreds of people long, and we had to wait at least another 20 minutes just to get to the elevator to go down. In addition, with the exception of the woman running the elevator, the staff were very unprofessional, loud, constantly joking with each other, and not really paying attention to the visitors. For example, they have this white, silhouette of a city skyline along the windowsill to keep people from getting up on the windowsill. Typical tourist woman was SITTING on the skyline, using her phone, but no one said a word to her. I would not recommend this experience; surely there are other places in the city to see a great view for much less."

Until you see all there is to see and to want to know more about what you are looking at, you tend not to rent the tablets that are demonstrated. Also, be sure to pick a beautiful clear day.

We were recommended to do this by a local, instead of ESB or TOTR, and so pleased we did.Short queue to pay, and not too long to wait for one of the several lifts to take you to the top. The lift goes from ground floor to the Observatory floor in less than a minute - but it doesnt feel like you are moving at all. The lift journey is brilliant and that is as much as I'm saying :-)Once at the top, another surprise before making your way through to the observation level. On reaching this point, you are pulled together thinking you are getting a talk from one of the guides, but this it to try and sell their Ipad interactive tour, so if you are not interested in this, you can bypass this and continue. We didnt bother.We were so lucky with the weather, bright blue skies and not a cloud in the sky. The views are simply stunning, all 360 degree of them. In the right place, you can take a picture looking down at one of the memorial pools. You can stay in the observatory as long as you want and you can wander around at your own leisure.The staff were helpful and informative.One World Observatory is well worth a visit. However, the cafe is very expensive (as you would expect in this location) so maybe wait until you are back outside for food and drink.We did One World Observatory prior to the 9/11 Tribute Centre and Museum, and for me, that was the right way around to do it.

Nice to see but I would prefer to look outside as we go up - although understandably that's not for everyone. There is another display when you arrive at the Observatory and then the walls go up to reveal the skyline view, very nice touch and theatrical. You can then wonder around over a couple of floors and make a full tour around taking in all the spectacular views. The staff are helpful although there were noticeably a lot of them, one came over to to see if we had questions. A nice touch and welcoming. The gift shop is hugely expensive and had nothing of interest for me. The photo shoot was fun but at $20 for the photo, forget it. Overall, definitely worth a visit."

We got the package deal of 4 tickets (this package deal is only available on-line) which can be booked for a specific day and time - it cost $105 including tax. Not sure why there is tax, but the price was less than individual tickets. Ignore the \"under 64\" age restriction. Not sure why it says that, but our ages were not verified. We booked for 7:15 pm so we could see the sun set (over the rather flat skyline of New Jersey). Views up Manhattan and across to Brooklyn were stunning, especially when all the building and street lights started to come on around 8pm! I think that because the elevator ride was only 60 seconds, it didn't seem we had gone 101 floors and I wished we were another 100 floors higher, to see further beyond midtown. You can see well up to around 34th Street, and the skyscrapers in mid-town block the view beyond that. Looking straight down to the financial district and the new Oculus / Fulton Center and the tops of the skyscrapers in the immediate vicinity was fascinating. Watching the sunset and seeing Liberty and Ellis Island in their entirety was very nice. The iddy biddy Staten Island Ferry boats darting back and forth were charming and there were lots of sail boats going in and out of Jersey City harbor. All in all, a very enjoyable visit. The sales hype for renting ipads for $15 (Audio in English with subtitles in a choice of many different languages) annoyed me because I am a New Yorker and know my way around, but my Italian guests I rented one, and found it useful as it can sense what you are looking at out of the windows. The noise of all the ipads was a bit irritating jabbering all around, but that's me."

The technology is mind-blowing. The security is ... what one would expect \u2013 very tight. The cost is reasonable and an unforgettable experience. Views - you can't beat them. In all four-plus directions. The cost if you go at off-peak times, is reasonable. If going at peak hours, think twice. The speedy speedy ride to the top of the tower is a wonder. You're shown an amazing illustration of the changing city since the 1600s when it was just a tiny settlement. You won't even feel yourself rocketing 100 stories above the city. That's actually part of the problem \u2013 one of the best features goes by way too fast. Once you arrive at the top you're shown a video and a chance to rent an iPad at $15.00 a pop. Not horrible, but little tacky. Don't worry, the hucksterism continues throughout the experience. To be fair, I did not try the food offered. Once you're touring the top floors you'll notice guides offering stories about New York. Sort of. Like what we call Uptown and what we call Downtown. And the chance to buy ... anything. Or the price of real estate. New York 101? All told, I found this aspect of One World Trade highly annoying and disrespectful. This should not be treated as an amusement park. The ground is hallowed as far as I'm concerned; 3000 people died there. The new Trade Center really has fascinating aspects to it, but shouldn't be treated as Disney ride."

Now When we visited New York this thing is our must to do list .We booked in advance on May 7th . There is hardly any wait. Great Views. You can see Manhattan, West street ,Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Bridge. Inside some people are explaining about New York history and about art We sat and watched about the history of The Time Square building. I learnt that it\u2019s empty because the owners are getting their money by bill boards ads . WOW! If you need iPads were available for $15. There is a caf\u00e9 and restaurant if you want to eat. After that we bought some souvenirs and went to walk on surrounding area and relaxed in star bucks and did Brooklyn Bridge walk. I wish I did some shopping in century 21, may be next time. People are very nice here and gave directions whenever we needed."

One mix bar is pretty cool. Definitely fun to have a drink with a view. The views are phenomenal, However I do wish there was an outdoor observation deck like the Empire State Building. It adds more to the experience when you can hear the sounds of the city and feel the wind on you. I remember visiting the original twin towers observation deck and it was so cool to get that experience. Cool experience over all."

While you cue to get to security you stand in the shadow of 1 WTC, and look straight up into the heavens. If there's no cue, stop a moment to look-up anyway.You walk in, then ride down to the security post(s) for a quick check - a la Airport Style. Polite & professional security people make this an easy (non-TSA) process.Collect your change & keys and walk 15 steps into a cool, dim and touching multi-media display of WTC history: Yes, all of it. Take your time, no one will rush you. Absorb the enormity of where you are, and what was there, and who you'll never see again. When you're ready stroll a few yards to the elevators, and prepare for your assent.Your elevator is also a multi-media experience; showcasing the \"P.O.V. Timeline\" from where you stand, looking out onto the past; going back 300 years to the present. It's a fast ride considering it's over 100 floors up.Get off on the elevator to be met with the spectacular current view. It's amazing and you think, \"It's small, but so very nice.\" However, you then realize that you're on a downward ramp to the main portion of the observatory.The circular observatory itself is modern, well designed and provides wrap-around views. It's almost impossible to have your vision blocked by others since the walls are all glass and run from floor to ceiling.From one side you can look straight out and see the Bridges into Brooklyn. From another side you look straight down to see the WTC Memorial. And Between, every view down-town & up, and into Queens or out to N.J.Note: a) Of course there's a gift shop; but not too expensive considering you're in NYC. And...b) Outlets to charge your phones at every turn. They are there for you to use. And...c) They offer audio tours (with head-sets) for you to rent. Offered in many, many languages."

First off, if you're reading this then you're probably interested in scaling a tall building for the promised views and wondering if it's worth the admission fee. The answer to that is a resounding yes. The views are stunning and, as long as you book in advance, you'll have very little wait and any gripes over the price are cast aside.The overall experience is nicely constructed. There's a suitable and obvious undercurrent throughout as to why the building exists at all and thankfully it's not overdone in any way, preferring to focus on the technical aspects and the history of the area itself. The build up to the views features a number of 'wow' moments that I won't spoil here, as it will be better if you can avoid them before you visit.What I will mention though, and it's the reason why I don't give this the full five stars, is the moment where you're given the sales pitch for iPad hire which interacts with the view to show you what you're looking at. It almost wrecks the momentum of the build up entirely and by that point you're itching for the views, but are instead shouted at by a guy with a mic about how it would be ludicrous not to spend $15 on one. No, what's ludicrous is that the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere doesn't have a single sign in the observatory pointing out features, other than a tour guide talking through the history of the views at fixed points. It's the most blatant rip-off imaginable and a cynical attempt at avoiding helpfulness to try and extort some more cash out of you. Nonetheless, it doesn't spoil the experience which is otherwise highly polished and one which you'll be glad you did. It features free and fast wifi for uploading the many pics you'll take and there's plenty of seats, food and drink to take your time over. Allow for an hour for the whole experience and enjoy yourself!"

The view is great eventually, but it somehow lacks immediacy because of the visual noise, the prevalence of screens and of course you're behind glass, so it takes some time to fully appreciate where you are and to begin to take in the view. Pity about the strong headache-inducing fumes from cheap soft plastic solvent from gift shop's keyrings which engulfs the entire southeast corner. The elevator descent was very cool!"

We also ignored all the add-ins of the green screen photo, iPad rental etc and therefore got to the top pretty quickly. The experience has been designed to be full of theatrical impact from the 360 degree evolving visuals in the elevator which whips you up to Floor 102 in about 41 seconds (your ears may pop!) to the 'big reveal' when a cinema-style screen rises and you join with others at gasping at what lies before you. I found this very moving. You go down a level or two for the Observatory itself and the views are completely spectacular. I am not bothered by heights myself and at no time did I feel unsafe but I could not help thinking about those people who had once looked out at a similar view but never got back down. Part of my decision to go up was to pay a sort of homage to them and also to say that no-one should ever be able to stand in mankind's way of seeing creativity at its best."

We had one girl give a talk about places to go and things to do using an interactive board which was a real highlight."

A quick presentation of everything of present day New York City including a rushing subway car. Then...it's time to move down onto the Observatory level, where you are afforded a 360 degree view of NYC, Long Island, New Jersey, upstate New York and on clear days Connecticut and Pennsylvania. This is definitely views that must be seen first hand to truly appreciate."

We were in the city with sun and clear sky's but of course the day we had booked to visit was rain with mist enveloping the tower. The staff were terrific and rebooked us to visit the next morning when it was fortunately totally clear again. I won't say anything about the lift except that it's almost worth the entry money alone, and your introduction to the view from the top sets the hairs on your neck tingling. I hadn't realised that all views were behind glass (doh) but this didn't impair the glorious views or quality of our pictures. The only downside was the attempt to persuade you that you needed to hire an iPad to enjoy the experience - in fact when you reach the observation deck you can just walk past the iPad demonstration and get on with your visit.

The view from the top is fine but no where near the views from the Empire State Building or Rockefeller center. The viewing room is fully enclosed which does not allow you to walk outside and contains many over the top, gimmicky, high tech screens and demonstrations about New York City events. There is very little history of the building, information on how it was built, Information on the design, or other information to make the viewing deck more than just windows on a city. This is the quintessential tourist trap and sadly not worth the money it costs. I personally enjoyed the older New York buildings for better views and a more authentic experience.

The day was crystal clear, so we could see all around the city with no obstruction or haziness. Kudos to NYC giving us great weather.now, back to the initial experience... You do have to go through security, so don't bring anything you'll regret later. Pack like you are flying. Once you start down the \"experience\" you walk past Disneyesque fake rock walls and even fake bricks. Seriously? Fortunately, it didn't last long. The ride to the top is enclosed, so you don't get a vertigo-inducing ride. The video of NYC through the years was cool and provided perspective on the area. After disembarking, they try to get you to rent an iPad tour guide. Don't do it. There are tour guides with iPads around the observation deck. If you aren't fluent in English, it might be a good idea. Otherwise, skip it. They also take a picture of you and yours (available for purchase at $35) in front of a green-screen of NYC. We took the picture, but skipped the purchase. And, now, back to the view. Just. Amazing.When we left the building, my husband tripped over the uneven NY pavement and dislocated his elbow. This prompted a day-long trip to the ER (Perhaps I should leave a review for that?) and a missed flight. Moral of the story? Watch out for curbs that aren't really curbs, but uneven mismatched pavement!"

Superb views are on show all around the top of the Observatory. Definitely unforgettable!"

I was extremely excited to get up the top of the One World Observatory but having visited Top of the Rock (the best view in NYC in my opinion) and Empire State, this didn't deliver as I had expected. Whilst the panoramic view was incredible, you are stuck inside behind glass - rather than being able to go outside and feel the air on your face. I suppose this is a safety factor however I felt it dampened the experience somewhat. The elevator up is scary - augmented reality all around you which left me feeling naucious quite frankly. The view was over within 30 minutes - and then you are sold to by a shop or cafe. I would say do it, but visit Top of the Rock instead!!"

The website is hard to navigate, and when you get there, the signage is poor, there is no documentation on the walls to tell you what you are seeing, and they spend all their time trying to sell you things: e.g., iPad guides, photos. The elevator experience is the only thing that is done well. If you go, skip all the commercial sales jobs, enjoy the view, and then go back down and look at the Memorial Pool, which is lovely."

We had pre-booked a 'Date Night' ticket which gives you an entry time and a glass of prosecco and shared dessert in the restaurant. I would definitely recommend this. We went up just before sunset and so saw the view during the daylight, sunset and at night. There was no time limit on this so we were there a couple of hours at least and stayed in the bar for more drinks after the included prosecco. The experience was really amazing and the view is fantastic. It's great that you can also go to the restaurant/bar as part of the experience as that made it really special. We hired one of the viewers which were being demonstrated by the staff there - it's like an iPad that you line up with the view and tells you where things are and gives you more info on the various sights. It was good, but if you are relatively familiar with the sights then it's not hard to pick them out and it probably wasn't worth the money on balance (I think it was about $15 to hire). I'm not sure if we just went at a quiet time (7.30pm on a weekday) but there was also no queue (unlike at Empire State) so that was great. The ticket was also very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this experience."

The film at the top, was very short and I felt that we were actually too close to the screen, but that was a minor detail. Once we saw the view we were amazed.

You can hire an ipad ($15) which gives information about all of the sights. It was neat, as it moved with you and gave lots of useful facts.

Definitely worth the visit along with the 911 Museum next to the World Trade Center Observation Building. No need to go on about how incredible it is, as everyone has already done that. So here is some Very Important info that not many others have taken to the time put on here.  (1) BUY YOUR TICKET ONLINE and print it before going. If you get there without a ticket you will stand in line FOREVER. Please look up \"Forever\" in the Websters Dictionary so you can fully understand what I mean. We saw people without tickets in line when we arrived and the line had not moved when we came down 1 hour later. BUT YOUR TICKET ONLINE AND PRINT IT.  (2) There are 5 types of tickets to purchase from Standard at $32 to Priority and Flex that double in price. When you purchase a STANDARD ticket, you have a time and date on the ticket. You are supposed to go at that time and if you miss it, you are not accommodated. We found this simply to NOT BE TRUE. Our ticket was for May 20, 2016, at 11:30 am. We arrived an hour early at about 10:20am and they don't check the tickets. If you have one printed you get in a line that is moving fast, and they just accept it without even looking at the entry of the building. There is a bar code on the ticket and they scan it right before the elevator. We were worried the scanner would know we are way too early, but it didn't. I am pretty sure if your date is wrong, you might be denied as the scanner might pick up on that. But the time seems to mean nothing. So don't waste you time on Priority or Flex type tickets at 2 times the price that allow you to go anytime during a specific day because they don't check this.  (3) Allow for at least 1 hour going up and coming down. Not long lines usually and it is quite a quick ride to the top with 6 large and roomy elevators. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT FEAR OF HEIGHTS. The elevator is completely inside the building and you won't be able to see outside as you go up or down. You watch a video on all sides of the elevator of a time lapse from when NY was a jungle through the years of today. Less than 20 seconds to the top. Observatory is completely inside and you are not out in the elements or having the feeling of fear of heights. The designers did this on purpose and it has worked quite well.  (4) There is a restaurant on one of the 3 floors of the observatory and also a souvenir shop. All 3 floors are available to use with any ticket. Also plenty of very nice and clean bathrooms."

            "review": "Excellent experience. Amazing! Once the 7 day weather forecast was firmed up and I saw the weather was going to be good - which it was - I purchased timed admittance tickets in advance. We arrived an hour early which on that day was no problem and we were able to get right in. It was a Wednesday, around 1pm and there were no lines whatsoever. No one else was in the elevator with us (except an employee). The elevator ride up is one of the best things about this experience, and to a lesser extent, the ride down - there is a \u2018show\u2019 on the glass 3-sided elevator depicting the growth of the city of New York from it\u2019s beginnings to today. The problem is that it goes too fast and you really want to look at it more closely, as each panel is different, so cool to see how the city has changed - I wanted to ride the elevator again and again! So well done, but too fast, as the ride up is something like only 46 seconds, very high speed, no time to savor the \u2018show'. So if you have a fear of heights or elevators, this cool \u2018show\u2019 will certainly make you forget that you\u2019re climbing super fast to the top of the 4th tallest building in the world! Once the elevator ride is over, you see a brief movie projected against the observatory windows on interesting screens, which then dramatically raise up and you are given a stunning teaser view of the outside - it\u2019s really well done! Next, you\u2019re moved into a side area where you are given a talk about the interactive iPad you can rent for $15 which points out all of the sights and buildings in the 360 degree view there at the top. I recommend that you get it. You only need one for your group as you can share it. Here\u2019s what happened to us - we thought, naahhh, that\u2019s a lot of money, we\u2019re just going to set our iPhone to Google Maps to figure out what we\u2019re looking at. That wasn\u2019t a horrible idea, but it wasn\u2019t the best. A family that was done with their iPad and was leaving, asked us if we wanted to use theirs and for us then to return it when we were done. So lovely of them, we gratefully said, \u201cYes!\u201d - and it was excellent! SO much better than using the iPhone and Google Maps. We ended up going all around the observatory again, this time with the iPad and really enjoyed the experience - the iPad added so much more information, and on many of the buildings pointed out on the iPad, you can click and then a mini-presentation is given with background info on that site/building. True, we didn\u2019t spend the $15, but knowing how much it added to the experience, I can tell you that it\u2019s worth it.Due to the lack of crowds, we never had to struggle to get photos in the windows, getting some great shots without other tourists in our frame. There are staff that give presentations near the windows, and other staff stationed throughout, to answer any questions. We had been to the observatory at the top of the original World Trade Center so to see the exact same view once again was very moving."

No queues, security was easy and they turned the whole experience into a spectacular show! From the film in the lift to the experience at the top this is by far the best view in NYC. We intended to spend about an hour in the Observatory but spent most of the afternoon there, including having a couple of drinks in the bar. It's pricey, but definitely worth it. I loved ESB and Rockefeller but would choose this if I could only choose 1. This is an absolute must for anyone visiting NYC - book a time in advance and be prepared to spend a few hours there.

When we got up the elevator, they PACKED us in to a very small theater space for some presentation. I told the girl \"we only have 20 minutes\" and she said (and I know she's paid to say it), \"oh, this is totally worth it\".... It's totally not - it's a sell job on the amazing view. I was there for the amazing view and I didn't need a sell job... When we were allowed to exit, we were ushered into a smaller room and, based on our location, were forced to wait through a sales pitch for the \"living map\" thing you can rent or pay for to enhance your visit and view... If I had more than 20 minutes, this might have been great, but really I JUST WANTED TO GO LOOK.... So we managed to sneak around the back of this sales pitch only to find the lines for the \"photo op\".... It took more than 2 minutes to actually get to a person so I could say \"I don't want a picture, I only have a few minutes\".... The view was amazing. It really was. It was from the Old Trade Centers and it is from the Empire State too.... But this was the first time my son got to see it and we literally wasted 7-10 minutes of our very short visitation window. I hate sales pitches, I hate forced photos, and I hate \"mandatory\" videos that are there to sell me on what I am already there to see.... Also, the people that worked there seemed mostly unhappy and were very short with folks standing in line. The view was awesome but the visit was honestly made unpleasant by the forced sales and unhappy employees. Maybe whoever is running the tours and makes a ton of money just on people riding an elevator should let those who just want to see the view see it and stop the commercial sales pitch garbage."

It seemed really overpriced so I did not eat there. To get the 360 view you go down a floor. The view is really nice but if you did not rent the tablet there is nothing to get your bearings on what you are seeing if you are not a New Yorker. Nothing else but the view so you don't need much time. Be sure to buy ticket on line to miss the line. The 9/ll memorial and museum is next door so nice to do it all in one day.

Made me cringe to see what it cost a family of 5 from Israel who were near me. If someone in your party wants to wait for you down at the bottom, bring your own chair. Big waiting area but not a seat in the space. My advice: don't support the crooks!"

It is great but he Empire State Building has more to offer, better location, better views of the city, fantastic architecture, history and being outside to view the city makes a huge difference with the noise of the city below."

The I-Pad adder is just OK. The presentations and views are terrific. It's time and money really well spent. It takes about an hour to get the full experience."

The price for admission I thought is quite pricey, hence, I prepaid for 2 tickets on the MasterCard Monday promo which was a bit more reasonable ($25/pp). This was a huge mistake as the day we were scheduled to go was rainy and cloudy. When we arrived, they offered to exchange our tickets for a different day due to Zero visibility. However, we were leaving the next day so we had no choice as refunds were not an option. We changed our entry time to later in the evening, hoping that when the city lights came on, we would be able to see something. No luck, Zero visibility really is Zero visibility. All we could see was a wall of white clouds outside the window. Remember that the building is really high up so low clouds can actually block the view, especially if it's overcast or raining. I wouldn't recommend going unless it is bright and sunny that day with no clouds. The one thing that is really cool is the elevator ride up and down the building. As you ascend, the 360 floor to ceiling video shows Manhattan being built from swamp land to modern times. As you descend, it shows the city all lit up with views all around. The rest of the props were not worth it at all. Everything is really expensive and they keep trying to push the iPad rental on us even though we couldn't see anything. That was a big turn off, especially since we just paid $50 for only a 50 second elevator ride. Word of advice, don't go unless there's no clouds."

Yes, you still need to go the Empire State building to get the outside experience which One World Observatory doesn't offer. That is also why I don't think you can compare them. Also fact that One World provides an unique view over the water makes it very different from the Empire State. I think you need to visit both while in NYC.

There are a few options, but we bought tickets for a specific date and time. If you arrive early, you can kill time or use the restroom across the street at the Brookfield Place mall. It's just a three or four minute walk and is in plain site from the observatory line queue area. There are four lines for the observatory: three to queue people up for the three upcoming times in 15 minute increments (for example there are lines for 5:00, 5:15, 5:30). Plus one line for ticket purchases for people who did not buy in advance. From our experience, the lines were well managed and efficient and the staff was very nice, polite and helpful.Once inside you go through the usual security checks and down an escalator to the elevator queue lines. The elevator ride up (and down) is actually one of the most entertaining parts of the whole experience (in my opinion). I won't spoil it, but if you're curious just search YouTube for 'One World Observatory Elevators'. Once at the top, there is a dramatic presentation and reveal before being lead down another escalator where you have the opportunity to rent iPads designed to assist you in finding points of interest as you look out over the city. Down another escalator to the actual observation deck. There's not much I can say here.. it's a panoramic view of NYC. And you can see for good long way. We went on a clear day so we had spectacular views. There is a gift shop, restrooms and at least one restaurant as well. The observation deck is spacious and it's easy to move from place to place. There are also two areas where live presentations are given.We went on Memorial Day weekend and I didn't find the observation deck to be overly crowded. I was able to make my way to the windows pretty easily. The elevator ride down was also a show in and of itself. As I alluded to earlier, Disney would have been proud of the entire experience! My group enjoyed this very much and I would recommend this to anyone visiting NYC. Hope this helps!"

If require even more freedom in your schedule you can shell out a little more for the flex pass which allows you to go anything during hours of operations. Even with \"skip the line\" it took a 30 minutes to wind your way through the rope line before the bank of elevators. They keep you entertained however with videos about the building and construction, so not a bad wait. Once on the elevator, the experience starts and is simply jaw dropping! We figured maybe an hour and actually spent 3 (including lunch which was not previously planned). We were fortunate to have a crystal clear sunny day with endless visibility. Huge kudos to their crowd control. Never a problem getting to the window to see and take photos. Spacious walkways made it easy to get around to all sides without bumping into anyone else. There is a cafe and restaurant with better food than your might expect. Overall, a must see when in New York for sure!"

One World Tower and the surrounding Memorial Park is truly a must see & do event in NYC.To commence the experience starting with the memorial park and seeing the survivor tree and understanding it's history is moving in itself (there are many tours around the park and you are bound to overhear a tour guide speak about the survivor tree).The foundation footprints of the original Twin Towers are vast, modern and initially plain on first approach. But when you stop to look longer this is when it hits you - spirits of the lost are there as the water cascades down the walls of the foundation footprints and glisten like diamonds in the sunlight, truly moving and stunning. If you see a white rose in any of the names this is because it's the anniversary of that named lost person, again, so moving.Once you gather your emotions of seeing the original resting place of the twin towers to look up to what now can only be described as a living memorial of the events of 911 and a true modern beauty of a tower \"One World\". The tower is so beautiful modern, almost like something from out of space from another planet has landed there in the park standing immensely proud and defiant of everything that is evil in our world, this really is a stunning building.When you enter the tower to get to the One World Observatory make sure you start rolling your video camera before you get into the lift. I don't want to ruin the experience but as soon as the lift starts to make it's amazing 45 second journey to floor 102 your in for a really amazing experience.Keep your camera rolling as you come out of the lift as you will want to keep the memory forever for what will happen next.As for the views, we had 30-degree hot sunshine and no clouds so could see out towards Staten Island (Statue of Liberty), New Jersey, Brooklyn, all the bridges (as far as George Washington) including the amazing view North of Manhattan and it's beautiful tower skyline of; Empire State, Rockefeller, Trump Towers and Chrysler gold top; in summary we could \"See Forever\"!!!The One Tower is very interactive and modern. We do recommend to use the iPad's which were $15 = worth it!These show you what you are looking at and also give short videos of the history of most of the buildings and bridges you view.Some reviews had said these iPad's are rubbish?! Not so! This is because if you walk around from various windows with the gadget pointing downwards it loses it's bearings so you need to recalibrate it so when you hold it back up to the window it shows you what you are looking at. To calibrate just swipe either left or right until the view you are looking at is the same on the iPad, it's that simple!We also did Empire State Building (Floor 102) which by comparison can only be described as (One World Vs Empire State) New & Today Vs Traditional, Organised Vs Unorganised, Moving & Spiritual Vs a Movie Icon.I will never forget 911 and the horrors that unfolded on my TV that day, getting to see the Memorial Park and the new One World Tower was a privilege and an honour and we are grateful to the sensitivity of the New Yorkers and USA to respect and remember the lost in such an amazing and touching way!(BTW, we purchased our tickets online using the official website of One World and our printouts allowed us to jump the queue and walk straight in, no issues and certainly none of the nonsense some other reviews have written regarding having to cross the road and go to a ticket office due to tickets they had purchased through agent websites - use the official website and you will be fine ;-)Also please remember when walking into the Memorial Park this is a resting place for those that lost their lives in the 911 tragedy, please show respect and composure as you would in any Church or Graveyard, it's the least you can do."

Comparison of One World Observatory to \"Top Of The Rock\" Rockefeller Center.One World Observatory:Advantages of Viewing Skyline from One World:1. Spectacular elevator ride up showing evolution of site from Pre-colonial to current day using 3 walls of elevator on the short ride up. (Tip - Try to stand near the elevator doors to better see the \"Elevator Wall Show.\" It goes by quick.)2. Impressive video presentation with grand unveiling of view.3. 3 floors of 360 degree viewing area spreads out a gigantic crowd for effective viewing MUCH better than the available space at Rockefeller Center.4. View of 911 Memorial Pools can not be seen from Rockefeller Center.5. Statue of Liberty can not be seen from Rockefeller Center.6. Restaurant at \"Top of the Rock\" is not available to children and is much more expensive than restaurant at top of One World Obervatory. Reservations are absolutely required.7. Only place where you can see view from the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and from the top of a 4 billion dollar building.8. Far superior gift shop than Top of the Rock.9. Option to \"rent\"an iPad (for $15) that has an interactive video display and identification of surrounding buildings by pointing the iPad at the view. A better investment if you can share this with an entire family. From my observation only 1 of 25 visitors was choosing this option.Advantages of seeing NYC Skyline from Top of The Rock:1. Outdoor viewing area allows for better photography than the inside viewing area at One World Trade Center Observatory.2. You can see the NYC skyline with the One World Observatory from the Top of the Rock. The skyline is not as spectacular if you are viewing it from the most prominent building in the skyline.3. At sunset from Top of the Rock, you can see the NYC skyline against the sunset backdrop. From One World Observatory you only see the Hudson River and the buildings across the river against the sunset backdrop.4. Many more restaurant options nearby at Rockefeller Center.Bottom line is both buildings offer unique view opportunities. I took my family to both and I would suggest doing both, but if you only have the time or money to ascend one building, I suggest Top Of The Rock because the New York City skyline is not the same without seeing the One World Trade Center as part of that skyline. The cost is similar for both with the One World Observatory being slightly more expensive overall."

That said, the overwatch view of the 9/11 Grounds is powerful and a symbol of recovery and fortitude. The building is a modern marvel of security, engineering and a guardian to the memorial below. I received my observation tickets in package from 911/ Ground Zero Tour. Highly recommend this tour group, see additional review for feedback. As others have noted, I would visit WTC in conjunction with the memorial grounds. The observation deck is internal only, but offers beautiful 360 views. I visited on a mid-Saturday afternoon, crowded but not packed to capacity. The elevator ride up / down from the observation deck provide a historical video of NYC's history. Well placed gift shop and cafe are also available on the observation deck floor. There is a small bar (maybe even restaurant) adjacent to cafe. I watched as several visitors attempted to walk in but were coldly turned away. Overall experience is A, and I would return with friends and family."

The initial images of the city are fun and exciting and it really is AMAZING when you get your first look at the city. We really enjoyed walking around and viewing the city from a 360 perspective.

You will not be disappointed. Set aside at least half a day for visiting both (this includes subway transportation). Also (for both), check their websites and make reservations. If you've got little or young ones, pack a snack. REQUEST: pls provide feedback/thumbs up to help me earn contributor points.REVIEW: As a first time visitor to NYC my \"must-do\" list included the One World Observatory. Before leaving home we made reservations online for a late Saturday afternoon visit, but when we arrived there was a line so long one of the employees said it would another hour before we'd even make it to the elevator. What made it more frustrating was the absence of bathrooms or place to buy snacks while in line. Instead of waiting we went to customer service and traded our tickets for an early Sunday morning slot. BEST decision ever. After a quick bite at a \"Sandwicherie\" next to the hotel (I have a review for them as well) we caught a near empty subway. There were very few people at the observatory and we spent as much time as we wanted without interrupting anyone else's photo opps or having ours interrupted. We found the facility clean and professionally run. Spectacular vistas abound from the viewing deck. A once around while emptyish may take 20-30 minutes even with taking photos and listening to presentations. For us, rather than rushing to check this off our list, we used the time to soak in NYC and appreciate the incredible American endeavor it took to build one of the greatest, modern cities on earth. I don't consider the observatory a highly interactive, exciting attraction. It's part remembrance, part reflective given the ground and area it is built on. It's moving to imagine what the place must have been like on 9/11."

We booked online back in the uk , no problems at all , very well organised when we got there , usual security checks on arrival the tower itself is fantastic from the lift ride to the intro at the top to the actual view , if you haven't been to New York this is a must , having done the Rockafella Centre and the Empire State Building I have to say that the one world observatory beats them all well worth the money and a visit."

It used to be Empire State Building and Top of The Rock, but One World by far exceeds all of the \"high rise attractions\" in NYC.Of course, if you can afford to do all of them, then do it (choose some at morning, some at sunset, and some at night). But, if you can only pick one then I would suggest OWO, especially if you have kids (we have a 6&9 year old). We only paid $90 with the Family Four pass...we experienced no wait time, and spent almost 3 hours at the top!! The views are tremendous...and the interactive iPads are way worth it for the non-New Yorker. Purchase your tickets ahead of time, and go have fun at the tip of Manhattan!!"

The opening video is informative, touching and well presented but when the view opens up.... wow!!!!! No words can do this justice, you have to see it for yourself...many, including myself shed a tear at the sheer beauty...two weeks later I can still well up at the memory. The weather was absolutely perfect on the day which certainly helped (mid May), it was a huge bonus but the fact is that view is whats its all about. Make sure you do this one!"

We've visited lots of places in NY over the years to see different views of the city, but hands down this is the best! We booked the 9am viewing, there was a small queue when we got there as you have to go through security, but this went down quick and was plain sailing. When you get through security there is a wall telling you stats about OWO, where the most visitors are from, how many people have visited etc. You then go through other sections, which I don't want to spoil for you then go on to the views. I would highly recommend hiring the tablets which tell you what buildings you are looking at, it was really useful and enhanced the experience, its costs $15 for this. There are also talks happening in difference parts of the observatory and again it's worth sitting down at one, they are prob a max of 10 mins long. Views are amazing, out of this world, make you realise how small you are in contrast to everything else and it's also a little bit emotional! We were probably up there for about 2 hrs and by the time we were leaving it was starting to get busy and you were having to wait to get a good view out of the window. Gift shop had lots of choice but some things very overpriced, had the option to purchase a picture that was taken of you, we declined. There are also places to eat and drink there. My one warning - avoid the $5 bottle of water!"

We were lucky to have a clear sky the day we went, which gave us the most incredible views of New York and the surrounds. Booking online was easy, and we only had to wait 30 minutes from the time we booked until we entered the queue. The show started in the elevator, to be followed by a short but excellent presentation, and then the stunning views of the City.This wasn't cheap, but we thought it was worth the money.Advice: (1) Unless you aren't familiar with New York, don't bother to rent the ipad-guide.(2) Make sure you go on a clear day.(3) Book online. If you do so, you only need to get there 5 minutes beforehand."

We had to see the 3 minute presentation projected on sculptured panels, which was worth the wait as the panels then raised for a view of the city. We were able to pass up the portrait station, but had to stand for the iPad hawking session before heading to the Observatory.

I am a sucker for visiting the highest spots wherever we travel and in New York City we have done One World, Rockefeller, and Empire State. This one being the latest, I would expect it to be the greatest and I genuinely believe that is the case.We were not sure we were going to be able to fit this into our itinerary so we did not buy advance tickets for a specified time. We arrived at 1:00 on a sunny Sunday afternoon in May and found almost no line. Within 15 minutes of arrival including buying tickets, going through security, and riding up we were at the top.Many of the tall structure observation decks in the world have some sort of \"program\" that you watch to give you some history or to relate some amazing details about the structure. The show here is very brief and does not go into any of the events leading to its construction. Bravo. No reason to turn this experience into a documentary. But, truly the history of this structure isn't in the Observation Deck it is in the 9/11 museum and memorial which YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST VISIT.When you get off the excellent elevator ride you will have the opportunity to rent an iPad with tracking displays of what you are seeing out the window at any moment and the ability to touch on hundreds of those things for further information. $15. We didn't do it because we were pressed for time but within 5 minutes I wished we would have anyway.For me, the views from One World are more interesting than almost anywhere else. I think the texture of the mid town skyline from downtown is fabulous (you should check out the whole Manhattan skyline including the Freedom Tower from Brooklyn). The view of the bridges, water, Brooklyn, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governor's Island are all superior from this vantage point.It is true that the whole operation is run like a commercial enterprise. You will have an opportunity to spend money, pay for photos, buy a snack, or even have dinner, but it is not a requirement and it is not obtrusive.The last thing I like about being on top of the World Trade Center is the fact that I am and the notion that we will never forget the ones who were taken from us and if you knock us down we will come back stronger than ever."

From here you can see the whole of Manhattan Island, the East & Hudson Rivers, Liberty Island and out to sea, but Central Park is obscured by buildings.

Once you step off the life you are then lead into a long room where the whole wall is made up of video screens that show scenes from the city. Once finished the screens rise up to reveal the view behind. Its really impressive, probably the highlight of the trip for me by far. When you reach the top its laid out on 2 floors, with a bar / cafe. We had 2 hot chocolates which were tasty and reasonably priced. We didn't opt to hire the tablet computers at $15 each which show us the various things to see around the area. The views are spectacular, even with 5 miles visibility. it was a bit hazy to get long distance photos but it didn't spoil the view, it really was fascinating to be so high up! You get all round views which are spectacular. There is the obligatory gift shop which sold some interesting if slightly expensive souvenirs. No issues on leaving, there were no lines to wait in. Well worth it for the money, even with the lower visibility. Just get there early!"

            "review": "It's all about the money - isn't it always?. This was a disappointing day and it made me miss the original Twin Towers all the more. Despite the tragedy of the attack and the deaths that occurred with the original buildings, I remember its observatory as one where you could view the landscape of NYC (with outlines of various buildings applied to the glass windows so you could identify the buildings you were looking at) and an outdoor observatory balcony. It also was also a \"freer\" atmosphere where you could walk around and not feel like animals in a pen.Before you even get to the elevator at the new \"One World Observatory,\" one walks through phony \"bedrock\" (made of fiberglass no less) and passes by \"cement\" walls (another staged element). You could see a better display at DisneyWorld.How disappointing the new tower observatory is. Besides ridiculously steep admission prices, the elevator going up showed a video on the wall panels of the changing landscape of NYC. Unfortunately, the elevators are full of people so there is no good view of the video and the video passes too quickly to really grasp the landscape changes anyway. Upon exiting the elevator, visitors \"see\" another video where visitors STAND (no seats! - no much for its \"theater\") and watch \"street scenes\" of NYC with visitors standing two-three people in front of them, again obscuring the video presentation (which is pretty worthless anyway as we all know the street scenes of NY - we just came in from the streets and the subways!). Then there is an attempt to take your photo so you can give them more money for the photos at the end of the visit. Then, they try to get visitors to pay $15 for an iPad screen which identifies the buildings (which, as stated earlier, one used to see for free as the outlines were on the windows). Finally, when a visitor is free to walk around, there is no where to walk as there is a huge bakery-restaurant covering most of the floor - yet another attempt to get more money from visitors. One has to walk down a floor or two to see out the windows. The whole experience was very disappointing. I would recommend that if you want to go to a tall, iconic NYC building, go see the Empire State Building; it will make for a much viewing and you'll get more for your money. 'Nuff said!"

I paid for the 'Date Night Package' which entitled me and my girlfriend to prosecco and a chocolate truffle each.Everything was professional and went smoothly right up until we arrived at the viewing level. After being pitched an iPad ($15) you can finally look down on New York after battling your way through the crowds. As it was a Date Night package I wanted it to be special and go at sunset so that could be a reason for the crowds.We arrived at the restaurant and the maitre d' said they were full and to come back in 10mins. She didn't bother to take our name down which led me to believe that they were operating on a first come first serve basis, which includes regular paying patrons to the restaurant, which after paying extra for the package left me in a bit of a bad mood.After finally getting into the restaurant I noticed numerous tables free in good positions to watch the sun set over the city, but it turns out that after paying for a premium package, you have to sit at the bar and not at a table for the prosecco/champagne and truffle. To top it off, they had run out of truffles so me and my girlfriend got one piece of brownie to share between us.My advice is to avoid this package and just pay normally if you want to go into the restaurant, although as you can imagine the prices are pretty eye watering."

From start to finish, it was a well organised experience, with incredible viewed and unexpected thoughtful touches throughout. The interior of the observatory is extremely modern, in a light and spacious style that makes the most of the incredible view and ensures there's as much space as possible for everyone visiting. Security is tight with airport style scanners on arrival, and tightly controlled groups to ensure numbers within the observatory remain manageable (although there's no time limit on your visit, which feels like the right call). We had booked a time slot for 11.30am but arrived early and were allowed in sooner. It wasn't very busy when we arrived but became busy towards the end of our visit.Aside from the incredible view, we took the opportunity to loan a tablet device with an augmented-reality type programme on it which showed information about different landmarks when you moved around the tablet. You had to stand on a North, South, East or West marker and feed into the tablet your location in order to access the relevant information for each location. We noticed that if we stood anywhere other than the marker, the device didn't calibrate quite right and the buildings didn't quite line up. All very easy to use though, and totally worth the extra 10 USD.An unexpected highlight of the trip was the elevator ascent. Firstly, it was unbelievably quick: less than 60 seconds. Secondly, the whole journey was animated film that displayed on the walls of the elevator, showing the history of the location and explained the geology underneath the tower. It sounds weird to say, but it was a real highlight of the trip, incredible imaginative and informative and really quite beautifully done.This was a real highlight of our trip to New York, I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city."

This is an amazing way to see and get a perspective of NYC including the burough of Brooklyn and New Jersey to the West. The elevator ride alone is a time-lapse story told in images as you make your way to the 102nd floor in about one minutes time. Of course, a clear day is the best way to see everything, but as tickets are \"timed\" entrance and so often need advance purchase, you need to check the weather before ordering. Do NOT bother with an additional $15 for an iPad. I found it not so useful, particularly as it doesn't show most of the few blocks right near the Observatory. Instead opt for the City Pulse where global ambassadors show many close up images and answer questions. The Sky Portal is a large circular disc that gives a bird's eye view of streets below in real time. You can dine here at a cafe, but there is so much to see in the main observatory as you walk around that we didn't do this. A not to miss place. You are then also close to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. In all, you should plan on at least 3-5 hours if you wish to take in the whole area."

The entire experience is extremely well done from start to finish. It is easy to get into the line and it went quickly. The elevator was a true show stopper and so quick. When you get to the top they do a great job of making it an experience when you first see the view. While I agree it is commercialized it is just so well done. There is room to walk around, sit and stay in the observation deck for hours if you want (we ate there only because we were starving, obviously overpriced but great views). We spent hours there looking around and hanging out. I think someone else referred to this as being commercialized, but it really just made us feel like hanging out there as there were benches and other aspects that encouraged you to stay. The deck is a circle and on each side there was a cluster of screens and a city guide. We happened upon a presentation (not sure how often they do them) and it was interesting and the technology they used was neat but it was about NYC in general, not just about the WTC. I think a little more geared to the building may have been interesting. And there is absolutely no mention of 9/11 or the twin towers that I saw, which was clearly intentional as they want to focus on the new with this tower and there is the museum and memorial to cover the history. Overall, this is a must see. Even on a cloudy/foggy day the views were great. We enjoyed our time there and the experience was much better then the Empire State building (confusing maze of lines, no where to sit and relax and spend time once you were at the observation deck). Our only complaint was that we felt rushed in the museum since we bought a package with the memorial walking tour, museum, and observation deck. We arrived at the museum at 12 and I asked the staff immediately if we had to be at 1 WTC at 2 as the ticket stated or if we could arrive later, they insisted we had to be there at 2 (and I knew from an experience at the Statute of Liberty that the time on our ticket there was not relevant). We rushed through the museum and didn't get a chance to spend more time at many exhibits and as soon as we arrived at 1 WTC it was clear the time on our ticket was irrelevant. I wish the staff was more knowledgeable about this because I did enjoy the bundled experience but did not like feeling rushed at the museum (and there is no re-entry)."

You go from ground level to 102 flights in 60 seconds. You don't even feel the ride. It was great, and I'd do it again. When you arrive at the top you step out into a room where your shown a video of New York City, when the video ends all of a sudden the screen opens up and your looking out a window. It was breath taking. I will admit I grabbed onto my husband's hand and held tight. But it was awesome. You then go down a set of steps that lead you to the 100th floor. I walked around the whole building there and had a great time. I even posed for a selfey sitting on the ledge. I would defiantly do this again. I saw places that I wouldn't have if I was on the ground."

They say that there are 20,000 skyscrapers there but from 102 floors up it looks like more then that. Make sure you don't go up to early so your view isn't obstructed by early morning clouds. The view gives you a similar view as the empire state building but from a different angle. Obviously it doesn't have the history of the empire state building but it something to see"

After you buy your ticket you go downstairs and wait in line for the security check. After that you wait in line for the elevator. When you get to the 104th floor you wait in line to get to a very small space for a presentation. Then you wait in line to get to out of that small room. Wait in line to get down one floor via escalator. And you get to enjoy the spectacular views.When you go down you also need to wait in a line to get to the elevator and then wait in line to get out of the elevator area.I was nervous for the elevator ride but it was not as terrifying as I assumed. During the elevator ride there are monitors all around which shows how New York has been rebuilt from nature to buildings and skyscrapers. This was really cool.Main point - lines after lines after lines to get to a small space full of people and more lines to exit the building.They should rethink their strategy of having closing people in a small room after that elevator ride as a lot of people expressed their discomfort in the small room.I recommend going during the evening (during dinner) when there is less traffic.I would still go back for the extraordinary view - this time during the evening - but I would hate having to wait in all those lines sweating my bal*s off."

Aside from that, the exuberant staff tries renting an iPad to identify notable plans and buildings, takes your photo (you can skip this if you really try) to sell you at the end and makes this more like Disneyland than what I remember as a fairly un-commercial visit to the Empire State Building (then the tallest building anywhere) as a child.

The Sunset Flex tickets allow you to skip ALL the queues so within 5 mins through security etc we were in the elevator. The elevator is an experience in itself! We booked our tickets the night before the visit and spent probably an hour watching the sun go down and chance the colour of the city. Not sure what the experience would be like on a rainy day ... We switched our plans we'd made at home to get a good night ... Seemed to be more flexibility for last minute plan changing for the Observatory compared to the Top of the Rock, where sunset availability was more limited and there's no flex.

Couldn't see north past the Empire State Building. Visibility wasn't great. We had to go this day as this was the last day my friend had in the city.

Having been to top of Original World Trade Centre a couple of times before that fateful day I wanted to see what the new tower would be like.I pre booked online before my visit but at the time of my visit (Thursday lunchtime in mid May) could easily have walked up to ticket windows with minimal queuing. Waited no more than 5 minutes to access the high speed lift (elevator) which is fully enclosed but has screens all around showing the view you would have seen as you rose to top. Instead of being able to access the viewing area you first had to endure an attempt to sell a viewing experience on a tablet computer for rent, then another queue to have the usual 'tourist' photo taken. There was no opportunity to bypass these two things which I found rather annoying and consider yet another way of 'milking the tourist'. The standard entry fee is not cheap and I have marked the score down deliberately due to this.Once I was able to reach the viewing area I was disappointed to find there is no open air gallery and all photographs had to be taken through glass with the consequent reflections ruining some attempts to take a photo. Although the views were amazing things could have been better by reducing the commercialisation of the experience.

The elevator ride up uses large format media (screens that run the entire inside of the elevator) to give you a quick glimpse of the history and how the city has changed over the years. If you get motion sickness easily, this ride up and down will definitely trigger it, you've been warned.Once you get up to the top, there is another short presentation which I promise you'll enjoy. (I won't ruin the surprise for you.) After that, there is an opportunity to get a device that will point out features and locations in the city for you. If you really want to know where things are, get it, otherwise save your cash (You'll need it for a souvenir.)Before you decide to visit, check the weather forecast. You'll want to go on a clear day so you can really see everything. We were there on a day where visibility was only a few miles. While the limited visibility didn't ruin our visit, it certainly didn't help it. We were able to see the Statue of Liberty and most of the major buildings in NYC, but a clear day would have made it that much better.The gift shop was pricey to say the least. A selfie stick was $25, a t-shirt was $30, an embroidered golf shirt was $130. If you want a souvenir, get it here because there is no shop on the ground. Take you time here if you go and get a good look. You'll be glad that you did."

The History of New York is projected on the Walls of the Lift showing where and when exactly what was built. It's amazing and very interesting. At the top the large space to walk around with the huge windows giving a clear view without any obstructions is fantastic. We had super weather so you could see for miles getting a birdseye perspective. It is uncomparable to other towers a big improvement on Space, No vying for Places to take Photos. You can rent an iPad for $15.- with a Panorama effect also with labels to Click on for info on the buildings etc. its Not a Must but for People that don't know exactly what they are Looking at it a good idea. Its well worth the visit"

We got the attraction with our big bus package, you just have to go to the mall in front of the building to change it. They let you enjoy the view as long as you want. We went around 3:00 pm and it was perfect, because it wasn't crowded. We regret not planing to eat in the restaurant that's in there, so if you can... Do it! :) just for the view."

The building, now sometimes called the \"Freedom Tower,' is technically the tallest in New York at 1776 feet, but that includes the broadcast antenna on the top of the structure. There are at least two buildings where one can be higher, both in midtown and both residential, but in order to see that view, you have to own one of the priciest apartments in the world or know someone who does. The twenty dollar fee for going to the top is worth it--once! There is a unique short animation projected on the elevator wall in the under one minute ascent to the top showing how lower Manhattan changed from colonial times to now. This is fascinating but it goes by too fast to judge its accuracy. The current observatory is all about the view--that of lower Manhattan and the Harbor are unsurpassed, but the views going uptown are not as unique. If you visited the old World Trade Center, there are certain similarities of view and those will give you pause and make you a bit somber, but not as somber as the memorial museum itself."

It is impossible however to be in this building and not think about how it came into existence and was brought about by the worst act of terrorism in our country. I was overwhelmed at thinking about the events that took place on 9/11. However, it is not meant to be about sadness, rather more about progress, perseverance, resiliency and the American spirit.

In April when visiting NYC I decided to go back to One World Trade Center and go to the top. It is an amazing building and I don't want to give away just how it felt to go to the top. You have to experience it yourself without being told what to expect. The day I went I did not purchase my ticket until the morning of. I wanted to make sure that the weather was good. It was a gorgeous day. I got teary eyed thinking about 9/11 and seeing how beautiful NYC looked from the top of the tower. You could see Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, cruise ships departing the harbor and the two 9/11 fountains etc. I capped the day off by trading myself to a cocktail in the bar. Met some really nice people and felt so joyful when I left. Be sure to stay in the area and see the 9/11 museum, St. Paul's Church and the memorial fountains."

Sadly with glare off the windows it can be challenging to avoid the reflection from the windows. But either way some cool views. I recommend having your video ready to record when you go up in the elevator (very cool) We was lucky to get a elevator to ourself which was ace. They do a interactive presentations which is interesting and some advise on places to go. I would recommend taking a walk across the brooklyn bridge its free and som really nice views. The 911 museum is worth checking out, not for everyone but worth see and the pools."

The downside was the hard sell of the guides to pay $15 to use the iPad with explanations and details of the history of various NY buildings and monuments.

We were able to bypass on of the final stages so we could get to the windows..wow, what can i say- it was spectacular and definitely worth going. It was a shame that we had to rush round but I'm so glad we made it. You can literally see for miles and miles and it is hard to believe that what you are seeing is real and not a postcard (sounds crazy I know but I had to pinch myself as it felt so unreal!). The queues to get down were EPIC but as we were in a rush to get to the airport the staff let us skip quit a lot of it (thank you- we made it in time!).

Try to get in an elevator with as few people as possible and face the screens with your back to the elevator doors. The walls are screens that show New York City progressing through time. The higher you go the more the city develops. We did this attraction twice on our visit to New York and the first time we were there when it opened to avoid the crowds. The send time we were there in the early evening on a Friday and there was STILL no line! It was an overcast day the second time so maybe that is why the crowds stayed away.We purchased the use of the ipad the first time up and DID NOT LIKE IT. What a waste of $15. This only shows you a few select buildings. Most of them are buildings you probably know... ie. Empire State and Chrystler Building. What you need to do is find one of the employees and ask questions about the city. They know a lot more. Or just use google. The iPad rental was a waste. We also declined to take a green screen photo. The views are so great up there and it is a special building in NYC. It is neat to see the old world trade center building sites (memorial) from above as well. Go when you can spend some time and look for your favorite from the observation deck. We loved it!"

Once in the elevator, you are treated to a video as you ascend depicting the changing face of Manhattan from it's inception to now. You are then treated to projected show of the city with people bustling around Manhattan. The wall then lifts to reveal a breathtaking view of the city. You can hire a handy little gadget that helps you identify all the parts of the city and gives you a brief history of major landmarks. I think this is great even if you think you know this city. Seeing things from this height can be disorienting and it's great to be able to know what you're looking at.The views are amazing and it's hard not to be a little emotional about the destruction of the twin towers that used to be so close by. They call it the Freedom Tower and it seems an entirely fitting epithet."

You get to the top and are ushered into an auditorium for a sensational 2 minute show that will heighten the senses... And has a real 'wow' factor at the end, although I won't spoil the surprise!The views from the observatory are just incredible. You can see for miles over Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, New Jersey, through the Hudson Bay and out to the coast and beyond. Visit on a clear sunny day and it will blow your mind. Or do what I did and visit at sunset and watch night fall across the city. It's truly moving.I'd recommend visiting the restaurant too, the cocktails are to die for and perfect to accompany the view.This place is truly special and well worth the $32 (or $37 at peak sunset time).

I'd already done Rockefeller and Empire states and had bad experiences, so went into this a little apprehensive but had a great time.The queues and getting in were well organised and plenty to watch whilst waiting to go up. And a great and uplifting display before you go into the observatory. And once at the top the views are magnificent - you can see for 24 miles they say, all round. There were a lot of people but it didn't feel as crowded as the other 2 sites I mentioned, the gift shop has interesting (although pricey) bits in it. Loved it, would certainly recommend over the other sites."

I booked online in advance, and whilst this can be quite restrictive if you don't have a fixed itinerary, I would definitely recommend doing this, as the queues to buy a ticket there and then were quite long. We didn't have to queue and went right in. Small wait inside due to security but this is welcomed and expected for obvious reasons. Small tip, start taking a video when you get inside the lift/elevator, the 60 second ride up is awesome and very well informed right from the start. I won't give it away, but I was sorry I hadn't taken a video on the way up. We had a glorious sunny day, and as a result the experience really was breathtaking! You get free wifi for one hour, so do this when you get to the viewing platform so you can update your social media with pics etc. I face-timed my husband in the UK the view so it was handy having the free wifi and he also enjoyed the experience! Excellent attraction and value for money experience."

Yes, it can be a bit pricey, but the views from the One World Observatory are not to be missed - definitely worth the price of admission! We skipped right past the line by buying our timed tickets online and then we used our World MasterCard to gain free VIP access, so we also bypassed the line to the elevators and got right on one, straight to the top. If you have a World MasterCard, buy a regular access ticket, preferably in advance online, then go to the guest services area under the escalator with your ticket and World MasterCard for a free VIP upgrade. Then sail past the line and right onto the elevator. At the top, we were treated to the captive sales show for the ipad that shows the NY landmarks. I had read about this in other reviews, so we skipped this sales pitch and went down one floor to the observatory level. The views were unbelievable - from the Statue of Liberty to all the way uptown! Beware though - the later entry times at dusk are more expensive and the tower closes early! We paid for a 7pm admission and were asked to leave promptly at 8pm closing time (April). Had we not had the advance tickets and free VIP upgrade, we may have only had a half hour or less to spend at the observatory. Snacks and souvenirs are available at the top, as is a pricey restaurant, which we skipped after reading the reviews. But we're so glad we didn't skip the Observatory - the view was breathtaking!"

The ride up on the elevator was the beginning of the show. Scenes of New York from its very beginning to current times were shown on the elevator walls, very informative. Next, you stand in front of a wall illustrating various aspects of New York life. At the end, the wall rises and you're looking out through the Observatory windows. From there, you pass into a passageway where someone takes your picture. Then, you can wander around to take in the view in all directions. I-pads are available for rent which provide additional information. Naturally, there's a gift shop (my wife bought some refrigerator magnets).The elevator ride down also shows current surrounding views on the walls. At the bottom, you can buy your picture showing One World Trade center as a background (choice of day or night views or both).Allow at least an hour to visit. They ask you to be there 15 minutes before your scheduled visit. Two suggestions: 1. Buy your tickets in advance online, 2. Go early to avoid the crowds (we went at 10:00 AM on a Wednesday and had tickets for the Museum at 11:15 AM, the timing was perfect)."

The security line and the line to the elevator moved pretty quickly. Compared to the Empire State Building it was lightning speed. The elevator was fast and the graphics were amazing. I the presentation before getting to the observation deck was good as well. The observation deck is great! (Again the weather probably impacts this quite a bit).

Purchased one and found it very useful if a little heavy.The views are quite spectacular and the obvious 360 degree view of New York City and surrounding areas certainly keep the interest alive for a fair amount of time.The usual 'attraction shop' with extremely overpriced merchandise.The eatery was slightly confusing and pricey and the food had to be eaten standing up!A good attraction for all the family."

You walk through halls with videos and information about the building. You go into an elevator, where the entire elevator becomes a video (almost looks 3D ) showing how NYC has changed over the years. I loved it! When you reach the top (going up fells like a few seconds), the line everyone facing the windows and they show another video and suddenly the view is right in front of you! The transition from the video to the view is amazing! For $15 you can rent like an Ipad (you can use one for an entire group, itdoesnt have to be individually) that tells you exactly what you are looking at. I would say it's completely worth it. I've been to the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock and definitely the views here are incredible. It feels less crowded (at least when I was there) and everyone will have a spot to sit and enjoy the view. They have like a coffee shop up there, I wasn't able to go in but I'm sure that enjoying a cup of coffee with those views in front is a great way to start the day.Worth going with the entire family. Everyone will enjoy it!"

I prefer the view from mid-town (Empire State, Rockefeller Center) so you can see Central Park and both directions of the City, but I wanted to see One World Trade, and I'm glad I did. I paid extra for expedited entry, which turned out to be a waste of money, since there was no line when I went (10:00 a.m. on a Sunday in March). It's probably worth it in the summer. If you're visiting Ground Zero, which I highly recommend, it's worth a trip to the observatory."

Once up there they have an iPad tour we did not do this - I live local so I was the tour lol. You must bring your selfie stick and \"the good cameras\" iPhone is ok but our pics from the Canon Rebel rock! it's spectacular photo op. A photographers dream at sunset. Dress nice, do your hair lol and take lots of memorable pics- this may be the family photo of a lifetime! The views are that breathtaking! Yes you shake your head yes when the goose bumps set in. :) There is a cafe and gift shop we loved both. 1 tip make a reservation at the restaurant / bar well in advance for the sunset viewing. We did not and will next time. Sunset was so special we all felt like the Bob Marley \"one love\" up there during this time. Everyone from around the world smiled and traded turns helping take photos. You bond up there together it's magical and you will know I'm saying when you are up there overlooking the greatest city on earth! Go do it! It's incredible!"

You have to pay 32$ as an entrance fee but it is definitely worth it. It is not just an observatory, it is an amazing experience! The experience starts as you enter the elevators that are surrounded by screens showing the development of the city through the years. When you reach the floor of the observatory you get to see an astounding video wall presentation of the city which then retreats and reveals the amazing views. You get to see the whole of Manhattan from the highest point and from a 360 degree perspective. It was worth every dollar. Don't miss it if you visit NY!"

We saved it for our last day \"if we had time\" since we have already done Empire State and Top of the Rock on other visits. Anyway, we had time mid-afternoon on the Friday we were there, so we went to see how the line was. We pretty much never stopped walking until we reached the elevators. Walked right up to the ticket counter, went through security, and went on to the elevators in less than 5 minutes. The views were spectacular and all of the staff working were very friendly. We spent over an hour walking around the top, seeing what we could from the different vantage points. My husband was able to get some excellent pictures, and we really enjoyed out visit.Overall, it was a great experience and something you should definitely do if you have the couple of hours to spend in NYC."

This tour is not on any NYC pass I have seen. The elevator going up was cool - the walls are video screens showing how the NYC skyline has changed over the years. The elevator is also very fast and made my ears pop from the altitude. The doors open to a spectacular view of the skyline, but then curtains close almost immediately and you are corralled to an area where employees try to upsell you an ipad rental with a skyline app. I think it was an extra $15. Then you are ushered through to get your picture taken (extra charge). After that, you have to walk past the restaurant to get to the other side of the observatory and see the view. The gift shop took up about 1/4 of the observatory and sold just ok items at inflated prices. There was an attendant at each end of the deck with video screens talking about the building and NYC in general, but there were only one or two small benches to sit and listen. I think it would have been nice to listen to them if there were more places to sit. The only other places to sit were in the actual window wells. The views were fantastic if you could get to a window - people were shoving and pushing to get in the front. My dh got knocked over by someone trying to get through and almost took out the video screens used by the attendants. The number of people using the skyline as a backdrop for their selfie photo shoots was hilarious. We bought a magnet as a souvenir, and the cashier said it was not a very crowded day so I would hate to see it when they are busy. The elevator on the ride down shows sunset over the city. I got a little queasy on the way down and I'm not usually a motion sickness person. I guess in all One World Observatory is ok. It's a beautiful building with a lot of emotional ties to it, and I don't want to be disrespectful for what it stands for. I just feel the whole experience was very commercialized and we were constantly being pushed to buy something. I wish I could've went to the top of the Rock or Empire State Building to see if the experience was any different."

It did remind me of Disney World with the way you are lead into one room & you think you're there but there is another door you go through to another room. Then the tease! They open the curtain only to quickly close it. Take your time in the observatory. No one rushes you out. There is a restaurant & bar a floor above the observation deck. It's a fun place to share remembrances. It is an uplifting experience."

One of the days we were there, they offered Summit tickets for a minor increase in price. Best purchase ever! We were treated like royalty. Shuttled up back hallways to the Summit. Summit was empty except for the bartenders and security. The entire time we were there, I only saw 4 other visitors on the Summit. The lower levels were packed because it was a Saturday and a beautiful sunny day. Great views, and great experience!"

We did not queue for any measurable time although I had expected this. The film on the way up was fun but brief. Could have happily seen it for longer or again. The iPad that shows you where everything is did not work as well as advertised and cost extra. We could have eaten here if we had said so from arrival but it did fill before long. They don't make the cafeteria comfortable. We did think this was worth the visit. It doesn't do exactly what Rockefeller does- different part of town and some sites visible from Rockefeller not visible but is higher and some things are better seen"

I won't spoil it for you but the elevator ride both up and down the tower is brilliant and you can't fail to be amazed.Once at the viewing deck, the initial presentation and view of lower Manhattan sets the scene. If there is only one criticism, it relates to the visitors rather than to experience itself. Why are people so inconsiderate with respect to other visitors wishing to take in the view and pictures.

It was very quiet. The introduction of the giant LED wall gave us a great introduction of new York city even though we had been the city for many times. The observatory self is also high tech. You can have a ipad giving you detailed description of the buildings, islands. They are full of history and excitements. My son listened every interest point. The weather was perfect with abundant sunshine. You have a much better view of the city than from other high rise points in the city. We got discounts from our hotel. It helped a great discount. The IPAD was one price for two for introductory promotion. The only inconvenience was the restroom. You have to wait if there is a large crowd. This is must visited site of NY."

Once inside and exploring the skyline, I had 2 different staff members approach me, as I was standing a little further back from the window, and talk to me about the different things I could see along the skyline instead of things people were seeing with their faces pressed against the glass. I eventually walked a little closer up to the window and it is quite an impressive view, even for someone terrified of heights. I suggest if you're afraid of heights to take the trip up and give it a shot. You can stand against the wall and enjoy the impressive skyline without looking straight down at the ground. We did the day time when it was a little cloudy and you can still see 4 different states and all the important landmarks."

That was the easy part, however, the online booking system did not coordinate with any weather advisories. There was no advanced warning that bad weather was in the offing on the following day for which two tickets were booked for and noway of getting an online refund.Thus when I and my girlfriend showed up the weather was so overcast that many tourists had to line up to get refunds for the time slot and that in turn led to lines that took nearly an hour or so to shrink. When I got to the ticket counter I was refunded but did not get back the full price of the ticket including the processing fee, which I wanted to use on the first available day in early January. So the motto here is don't book online.The following week we came back and purchased two tickets. As it was the beginning of the year the line was very short and were able to go to the top relatively quickly.While the experience is better than that of the Empire State Building, One World is very expensive if you price in souvenirs , food and a visitor's tablet which is somewhat helpful but way over priced.I guess the bottom line here is that One World is fast becoming a tourist trap just like many other attractions here in NYC. Therefore, I would encourage management to think a little more carefully and creatively about the visitor experience starting with ticket purchases and line management. After all no one should have to wait an hour or so in the cold to rebook or get a ticket refund. This should have all been handled online with live customer reps, not to mention weather advisories. C'mon; this is the 21st Century with smart phones, internet and Ipads. MUCH BETTER COMMUNICATION AND MESSAGING is needed.I will advise my friends and relatives who come to NYC to be \"buyer beware,\""

Very sobering to look down 102 stories and see the reflection pools and the 911 memorial.

Of course, the views are spectacular and I highly recommend trying to go on a clear, sunny day for the best views because if it's foggy or cloudy your view will be very limited.

We opted for one of the flexible day passes as we weren't sure what time we were going to be visiting, this was great as it gave you the whole day to check out other places in the area and meant we weren't rushing around to get there on time. The flexible pass also gave us priority queueing so we weren't waiting in the long lines like with most attractions. At the top there's a restaurant, gift shop and 360 degree views of the city. It's just incredible. We spent a good hour up there trying to photograph every angle of the city! A must see for anyone visiting NY!"

It's impossible not to be moved by the adjacent memorials on your way here and you find yourself in reflective and poignant move as you enter. Nevertheless, the building is about optimism and the future. The queues moved quickly and the security is no more than you'd expect. The lifts are amazing in themselves and the observation decks are superb and with much more going on than just a few windows and an amazing view. I won't give away any of the surprises - you should go and see for yourself, but I think the way they introduce you to the New York skyline is excellent. As ever, staff who must be tired of saying the same thing so often through the day are always genuinely friendly and this left a lasting impression."

Our visit to the top of Freedom Tower pretty much gives us a hat-trick for visiting Manhattan\u2019s skyscrapers: Empire State Building, Top of the Rock, and now One World Trade Center. And the views from the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere did not disappoint! An electronic map at the entrance shows, in real time, where each visitor has come from \u2013 specific countries, not \u201cDon and Anne from 54th Street.\u201d They actually have you descend to the basement to board the elevator that whisks you to the 102d floor in 60 seconds. During the ascent, a time-lapse video recreates the development of Manhattan Island from a 16th century swamp to current-day metropolis. And the landscape continues to evolve from there until you reach the top. The iconic Empire State Building will always, for me, define the skyline but I have to say that Freedom Tower has pulled out all the stops to give visitors a 21st century experience. You can rent an iPad that tells you exactly what you are looking at no matter where you aim it. At the north and south facing windows they have a sort of tour guide telling you about NYC \u2013 again, with extensive use of digital technology. The only negative comment I have is that the gift shop prices are outlandish: $175 for a golf shirt???"

The cost of admission for two adults and one senior was $94. iPads were available to rent at a price of $15 for 2 (buy one get one free); however we did not rent those. There is a security check prior to entering the lift. The security staff were very polite and courteous. My bag contained an asthma inhaler that was detected on X-ray and they politely asked me to show them the contents of my bag. Upon seeing the inhaler they immediately confirmed that was what they saw and let me through. This was in contrast to the following day at security for Liberty Island where the security guard there started routing through my bag carelessly and spilled some of my stuff all on the floor; then left me trying to find all my belongings as he moved onto the next tourist. The elevator ride up the tower is a spectacle in its own right. The evolving NY scenery in the remarkably quick ride is excellent. Once you are out of the elevator, the grand 'unveiling' of the view is also remarkable and well worth the wait. The view is spectacular and there are plenty of wonderful photo opportunities. However, unlike Empire State; there is no 'open air' viewing floor; hence the windows will always be in the way of a perfect photo. We went in the day, and the more expensive evening option could result in reflected flashes of windows when attempting a photo. Approximately one hour would probably be sufficient time to enjoy the 360 degree view plus to take any photos. Hence, although the observatory is a must see; it is a pricey one. Liberty/ Ellis Island takes a full day and costs 2 adults and 1 senior $50 in comparison. There is a cafe in the observatory that we did not use which looked nice. There is a gift shop and an enforced 'green screen' photo opportunity where a package of 2 prints (one day and one night) plus digital downloads costs $25 plus tax. In our case I genuinely liked the photos so I bought them. The fountain memorial outside the tower is both tasteful and moving. Overall this tower is a must see, although it is very expensive, particularly when considering the length of a typical visit."

You will be able to quickly buy your tickets (regular admission $32 pp adults) and move through the security checks. The whole process is well organised and the staff helpful. The lift up to the 100th floor observatory deck took 56 seconds and can cause a little concern with vertigo sufferers. But even though your ears might pop a few times and your tummy flip, the experience and view is well worth it. The view is 360 degrees and glass enclosed so 100% safe and a pleasure to walk around. The clean restrooms and cafe are a pure pleasure (although the cafe a tad pricey). When you go to the WTC, make sure your camera is fully loaded and you take your time to drink in the Big Apple and beyond. The view seems endless. Definitely highly recommended. Once you exit the building, visit the black pools which are the memorials to those 2606 lives that perished in 9/11. Make sure you have tissues handy as the memorial will definitely bring tears."

After being ushered into the \"theater\", we were treated to a big screen video of NY scenes after which the screen rises to expose the city below. It's quite a nice spectacle. But there are some downsides to this attraction:1. We bought vouchers from TravelZoo, which I printed out. My bad that I didn't read the fine print about needing to go to the WTC website to get tickets. Thinking that the voucher was enough, we went with just those docs. We were told by the girl scanning the tickets that we had to go across the street to the \"redemption center\" to get the tickets. Once there we were told that they could do nothing for us, that it had to be done on the WTC website. Had we been told that we could have used our phones to access the tickets right on site instead of traipsing around a shopping center looking for a non-existent redemption center. It would be nice if staff were updated on these processes.2. It is sort of tacky that at every turn there is another attempt to wrangle more money from the visitors. From the hard sell of the Apple interactive tool, to the forced photo op in front of a green screen, to the never-ending souvenirs, it would be nice if there were less of a hard sell during the entire visit. We already have the Empire State Building for that.This observatory will become a classic spot for tourists for years to come. I hope that it will strive to maintain the dignity and good taste that this spot deserves."

This way you get to see the daytime view, sunset and the night view of Manhattan and about 20 miles around. Check the weather report so that you go when the top is not surrounded by clouds on a rainy day.Great for tourists. I live here so naturally it gets old for us NYers.Take a video camera or use your smartphone because the elevator and entrance video show is worth the price of admission."

You can take all the time you like to see the spectacular views and there are local, knowledgeable guides to offer insights about the city's many venues. We purchased tickets in advance for the earliest time available on Saturday and were very glad we did as this is a very popular location for visitors. Terrific photo opps abound. The location has a very tasteful gift shop with lovely souvenirs and momentos. There are snacks and dining options available but we did not partake."

            "review": "Definitely worth seeing. This attraction consists of taking a high-speed elevator to the top of the Freedom Tower. I felt that this was overall worth seeing as part of a New York sightseeing trip, or if you're a local and haven't been there. Tickets are purchased generally as a timed ticket. There are options that are more flexible but they cost much more. The trip begins with a bag check and metal detector. This is not unusual for any attractions in NYC at this point. It was no more cumbersome than any other that I've encountered, and certainly much quicker than airport security.The elevator is super cool. The walls are video screens that take you from before there was a New York, all the way through the different eras - it's like a time-lapse video of the building of NYC. I'd stay in that elevator all day. Catch it quick because it's not the same on the way down.The elevator is quick - I want to say it's under a minute. Stepping out, they do herd you into a block and try to rent you an ipad device which gives you more info on what you're looking at. I did rent one, as I have kids that very much enjoyed it. However, I'm not convinced that the rental was essential for the average person to enjoy the experience. It was only $15 though, which I didn't feel was unreasonable.Views are spectacular, and you can walk all the way around the entire perimeter of the building. The upper floor is dining (there's a snack bar/quick service style restaurant and a sit-down ($$$$) restaurant. I have to comment on the service here - it was truly excellent. Each and every employee there was courteous and went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met, even though we were just one family among a crowd. There are two areas that I'm less enthused by, and this is why I don't give it 5 stars:1) Cost: Wow is this expensive - our party of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids) got just the very basic ticket, and it cost us $117. Ultimately it provided about 1 hour of entertainment, plus we ate lunch up there. By contrast, you get an entire day's entertainment at the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island for about half that cost. 2) In comparison: This building has in its favor its height (the tallest in the city/continent). The interior architecture in the observatory isn't interesting, and honestly I find the building itself just OK in terms of skyline interest. I'm not trying to bring nostalgia in here, but it is impossible to not compare it to the original twin towers, which I've also been to the top of. In that building, you had the additional awesome experience of seeing this equally tall building within what seemed like spitting distance. Here, you're basically an island and there is nothing nearby other than the empire state building for contrast. This isn't the fault of the architects, certainly, and we can't turn back time and get those buildings or the lives lost in them back. But I found this less impressive than the old buildings. I also much enjoy the Empire State Building a bit more for the interesting architecture, proximity to the Chrysler building, and the ability to see the Freedom tower from there...to me the Freedom Tower is more impressive to see than it is to see from, if that makes sense.Overall, though, a great experience. If I had to pick just one, I'd probably pick the empire state building. But absolutely worth it to do this one."

I booked online, a few days before our trip to try and ensure the weather was clear on our visit. They also had a special offer for families. I went for an early morning visit to avoid the crowds. The views are truly breathtaking, you can see for miles. There are a number of tour guides on the observatory deck that will answer any questions you have. There is also an ipad option on the deck, it calculates which way you are standing and will tell you whats out the window. There is no time limit when you are up there.We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and would recommend.The only flaw in our trip was the security staff who were checking your bags etc at the bottom, they were very rude.Finally if you are down this area make sure you visit the new PATH (subway station) designed by Santiago Calatrava, it is beautiful."

Out of the three main observation decks in NYC -- One World Observatory, the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock -- this is not the best one (I prefer Top of the Rock). One World Observatory obviously boasts great views enabled by its height, but all floors are enclosed and therefore all views are obstructed by glass, which takes away from the impact and causes reflections in the photos. Also the visit starts on the 102nd floor with a very cool visual presentation but then you go DOWN two levels to the observation deck... The point of an observation deck is to go as high as you can. The coolest part of the visit is the elevator ride. Three walls of the elevator are video screens and as you climb up to the 102nd floor you also travel in time from the 1500s when NYC was founded to today. On the way down the elevator simulates a flyover of the downtown area, Willy Wonka-style. But if you're looking for are great views and great pictures, go to 30 Rockefeller Plaza."

Tickets start at $32 & don't remember what the cost is for children. When I arrived the lines were not very long to buy tickets there but then I went on a weekday.There is a lot of security there. Getting into the Observatory is the same as going through security at the airport. Everyone had to take their belts off & cellphones had to be taken out of pocketbooks, backpackers, & pockets. Shoes did not have to be taken off.The elevator ride was very smooth & you faced the back of the elevator which showed different views & showed the height as you went up. I made the mistake of buying the Priority VIP flex ticket & therefore missed things on the other 2 floors. I spent a lot of time in the restaurant, which was expensive, but I had a great seat & view . I would recommend getting the IPad which points out different buildings & other points of interest.

Can take a few mins to get a window space due to the volume of people but they let you stay as long as you want so patience is key. So beautiful!"

Once on top, you'll have a terrific 360 degree view of lower Manhattan and surrounds....Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Brooklyn Bridge, etc. They have also have lecturers, giving you information about what you're seeing, so plan to take some time on your visit. There's also a restaurant(expensive) and a bar(reasonable for a drink with a fabulous view) and, of course, a gift shop(ridiculously expensive). Save your money, have a drink, eat on the street, but don't miss this view. The building, and the park with the waterfall pools are beautiful. More to come. There's lots of ongoing construction in the area."

For some reason I thought there would be more to it than just walking around and looking outside. If you wanted to know what you were seeing, you had to pay $15 more for their iPad to take around with you. However, I do have to say that it's a very ingenious program. It's very close to the 911 Museum and if you plan on staying in that area for a while, then I'd say try it but it's not a must do if you don't have the time or money."

We booked online before we arrived in New York so didn't have to purchase tickets, but there didn't seem to be a problem if you just turned up. We were whisked to the 102nd floor in less than one minute (having waited minimal time for an elevator) and that experience in itself was pretty amazing. Once there you are greeted and you get the opportunity to hire an ipad which will give you details of which building or attraction you will be looking at once you get the view (which is on the 100th floor). You then go down to floor 100 where you get a 360 degree view of New York with no time limit to enjoy the view and opportunities to take as many photos as you wish. I was amazed! I am not good with heights and felt a little dizzy but honestly didn't find it too much of a problem, probably because you are inside the building the whole time (which isn't the case with the Empire State Building). I found it better than the Empire State Building, although I would also recommend that one too, despite the very long queues there (the One World Observatory wasn't built last year when we went). This is an experience I would not have missed and highly recommended! Quite stunning and a terrific experience"

The trip to the top is amazing in itself - you reach the 102nd floor in such a short time that you can't believe you have actually arrived. The elevator walls show a video depiction of the city from its founding through present time as you ascend, which is very cool. When you enter the viewing area, the shade are down and you are shown a short film of the city. Then the shades rise and you are treated to a stunning view of the city. We were there on a sunny day, and the views were great. You can't see Central Park from there - the buildings in the center of Manhattan block it from sight. But you can view the East River, Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Hudson River, New Jersey, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Staten Island....great views from everywhere. One thing that somewhat detracts is the fact that there is no outdoor viewing, so all photos are taken through glass. Even though they work to keep the glass clean, there is almost always some kind of reflection to mar your photo.

Just be aware it is lower Manhattan you will see so the Statue, etc. and not Central Park. And the view looking straight down at the pools marking the footprints of the Twin Towers is very sobering. There is what presumably was intended as a glass floor but it just has a screen underneath it showing a view of the street so there is no sense of depth and is a bit of a non-event really.Special mention also for the lift up there, amazing, especially the ride back down again. The walls of the lift are all display screen and the journey back down is superb and made me want to spend all day just riding up and down in there!"

It is a wonderful building in its own right, and we loved the video on the way in and in the lift about the people involved in the build. Don't forget to visit the 9/11 memorial across the plaza. You can book tickets on-line and reserve a slot. We arrived about 10 on Thursday and walked straight in, glad to have saved the money, The other thing is you need to watch for the weather, so I say just go when the weather Is right.Gob-smacking views. We had coffee and a muffin and took it all in. If you don't know the City, the IPad rental is probably worth it."

I have kept up on the developments of this tower (formerly Freedom Tower), and found out that it is now open to the public from my airport car driver. I used to go to the top of the Twin Towers and was familiar with the view, so I booked tickets immediately.The high speed elevator to the top is a great digital experience, showing the development of NYC over the centuries while you are effortlessly flying up 104 stories. It surrounds you, so the visual experience was gorgeous. There were absolutely no lines from entrance to the observatory. Once you get into the observatory, the 360 view of the city was spectacular. Again, I was used to the experience, so able to compare the experiences.At one corner of the view, you can see the two memorials and footprints of the old towers by looking straight down. You can also see Lady Liberty to the south, and the NYC skyline looking north. Even as a New Yorker, this view is amazing. Well done!"

Upon entering one must go through security, just like in an airport. After passing security, you go through a dimly lit area that leads to the elevators. This area contains some history of the World Trade Center. The elevators that take one to the Observatory are very fast, and they contain pictures of the New York area and list the elevation above ground as the elevator ascends. Upon reaching the Observatory, there are several tour guides available for questions and answer. The Observatory is strictly indoors, but the views of the New York City and New Jersey areas are superb and make for great picture taking. Actually, a photo enthusiast can spend an entire day taking pictures. There is a souvenir shop and restaurant available for a visitor's use. In summary, my wife and I view the World Observatory as a must attraction for anyone visiting New York."

There is quite a cool video in the elevator ride up to the top and an interesting introduction video you have to watch before you enter the observation deck, but it is only about one minute long and is actually pretty good! The observation deck is really big, there's plenty of windows to find a good spot to take pictures from despite the amount of visitors there. We went up on a clear day and the view was unbelievable in every direction, you can see literally the whole of the city in every direction and the city of New Jersey. They let you stay at the top for as long as you want and take as many pictures as you want, and there is even a restaurant and shop up there so ideal if you want to relax and enjoy the view with some food or drink. Probably the only observation deck I would pay again to go back up, as I would love to experience it at night. Another must visit."

If you have a World Elite master card or certain other master cards you can also get priority access free. The regular adult fee is $32, but goes up to $37 from 6-7 PM. I happened to reach the ticket booth at 7. I still got to see daylight and then a gorgeous sunset over Jersey, and stayed until it was dark and the lights of the city blazed away. It's worth it to see it both daytime and nighttime if you can. There weren't too many people when I was there (I can imagine on a crowded day it would be intolerable) but there are enough annoying types to monopolize viewpoints or just use the windows for sitting (when there are plenty of benches) when others trying to take photographs. I actually gave up on a few choice perches because a couple of guys had basically staked their claim for an hour or because a group of bored-looking young'uns was sitting in a choice picture spot, texting and not even looking out the windows. Was wishing come of the very cheery and helpful workers would notice this and suggest they allow others in, but no such luck.Didn't try the food - bought a few souvenirs in the shop (typical - very much like the Space Needle or Willets Tower in Chicago, only with the Freedom Tower on the items instead). Still can't really figure out what the Skyport was supposed to do.The elevator is the fastest I've ever been on (an ear popping experience both coming and going) and while going up shows NYC from the XVI century on; going down, shows the skyline swirling around you.If you have to wait there are films of the construction crews to watch. Not having to wait, I can't comment on these."

I would recommend this for both New Yorkers and visitors alike. It is a great way to get a bird eye's view of the city. Now the focus is downtown. Though one could see Chrysler Building and Empire State Building clearly, one gets a very distant view of Central Park. I also recommend having lunch up here too. Where else can one dine with such a view as backdrop? Food was decent and service was friendly and professional. Really not that expensive considering the locale."

The only problem was it went by so fast I would have liked to have seen it in pictures once we got out the elevator. There is a small film clip of New York life and a little teaser of the views before you get to the observation deck. The views are absolutely amazing! It is very relaxed and there is a cafe at the top. This was a great experience and on a clear day you can see what seems like forever. Definitely worth a visit."

Led round to a sort of quick film show which is ok then the screen goes up and you get your first glimpse of the skyline. Words cant describe the views. Just WOW. The screen drops back down and you are lead to the observation deck to take the sights in at your own speed. If there is one very slight negative there is no outside viewing platforms so you sometimes get reflections on the photos but it doesn't spoil the adventure. Done ESB and TOTR so this gives a completely different outlook to the city. Well worth the entrance fee."

The views like any other in NYC are spectacular but because it is downtown you see a different side to it. It is quite expensive to get in and there were 4 of us so only reason I've not given top marks but there is plenty to see inside and out, as you make your way to the elevators there is the story behind the building, accounts from the construction workers etc which really reminded you about the emotion this building gives after everything that happened since 9/11. Once your up top there are people telling stories about NY, you can use ipads to help guide you to the views you are seeing, definately worth a visit."

It starts that the wait is far less, the elevator up with the movie inside making it look like you are outside is really cool, the big reveal when you wait to enter the top floor and then the top to bottom huge windows with the truly 365 degree views were amazing. And you are inside, not freezing or sweating away!Advantages of being in lower Manhattan: a closer look at the Staute of Liberty, Ellis Island and 911 Monument. You are so high you can see the ocean, all airports, bridges, parks etc. We ended up sitting there for a good hour, which is not a problem at all, and there is so much room at the windows that you can take as long as you like where you like without feeling you have to make room for someone else coming in after you.Worth every penny"

You then move down to floors 101 and 100 for the main views which are immense. Really clear day and you can see for miles. The journey back down in the lift is equally enthralling as the one going up. Highly recommended."

There are 102 floors and your ears do pop and it doesn't feel right but it gets better. I would advise you to get a selfie stick if you are visiting New York because there are great photo opportunities here and at other places. Overall it was a absolutely great visit."

She was too busy chatting to another sever. In fact she charged us more for one of our tickets which we didn't notice until we were through security.

Paid for tickets (no queue) and went straight to the security line which took the longest part of the visit. It's a small price to pay to make sure everyone is safe. With that bit done we headed for the elevator, which was an experience in itself, (I won't spoil it for you) and out to the observation floor. Although you can't go outside, which for the day we went was a bitterly cold wind, the views are amazing and great views of Liberty, Staten Island and more. You do need to angel your camera to avoid reflection back but you will not be disappointed. We sat for a while listening to the guide telling you about the area and history,originally from the the UK the lady was very good and entertaining to listen to.

Though there were no queues at Sunday 9am, nor at 5pm when we passed through another day.Both have their place.

Once you come out of the lift you go into a viewing room where you stand and watch the screens giving you different aspects of New York, and then the surprise, which I won't spoil, it was just so awesome. Then you go in to the actual viewing bit you can walk around at your own pace,360 degrees views, you can pay for a mini iPad which gives you info on the sites etc, but we didn't as there are plenty of staff that can help or explain things to you.You get your photo taken with the attraction in the back drop, we bought our ones, for 25 dollars.We were lucky because the weather was clear and sunny, so we got the most amazing views of Manhattan.The views of the Statue of Libtery, and Ellis Island were good and clear ,This is truly a must if you go to New York, the experience will stay with us forever ,both me and my daughter agreed that was the best view ever , better than Empire State BUilding.

Words can't describe the breathtaking views of New York, its far superior to the Empire State or Top of The Rock. Tip: one of the guides advised us to exit into the new transportation hub they have built underground. It had only opened and wandering around we suddenly found ourselves in the new Westfield shopping centre across the street. The designer shops were a little out of our price range but there is a great foodcourt there with amazing views of the river and lovely walkway outside."

If you've never been before, its a must do on a trip to NYC. We visited in July. The city was hot, and the line outside for tickets was LONG. We bought online tickets via our cell phones standing outside and were able to bypass the line and go right in for the next tour, so I recommend ticketing in advance just to avoid any line going up. The elevator ride up is pretty interesting, as the elevator is lined with screens that show how the city grew from nothing into the metropolis you'll see at the top. That's just the first part of the \"show\" before it finally lets you see the skyline for yourself. If you love NYC, the whole thing might bring a tear to your eye, as it did my companion who had lived in the city for several years and only recently moved away for a new job. My only complaint is that we also faced a LONG line going back down when we were done. That one couldn't be avoided.Tickets are not cheap. They were $30 each for the two of us last July. I would go again myself, but only with someone who has never been there."

This was American preparation and presentation at its very best and well worth making the trip. Well organised and superbly delivered. We purchased tickets at the best prices direct with the website. Very slick, efficient with the facility to self print tickets at home before you travel. This is not a cheap day out but the memories should last. The elevators to the top are rapid, and something that I had worried about as I have a bit of a phobia about lifts and enclosed spaces. However, it was unexpectedly pleasant and there was no real sensation of movement. I could hardly believe we had arrived, but the journeys both up and down were filled with distractions and visual information. There is a cafe and shop at the top and a leisurely opportunity to wander around the top 2 floors through 360 degrees and enjoy the long distance views. For me this was the highlight trip of our stay in New York."

For our liking it was too busy (a few days after Easter, in the middle of the day, so lots of school kids). Also it was so warm. The views are outstanding, but don't expect any outstanding photos as you are behind glass (unlike the 86th floor of the Empire State) and get reflection from it. We'd also done a helicopter tour the previous day, and to be honest we didn't really need to go to the Observatory. But as it is the largest building in the Western Hemisphere, we thought we ought to, something to cross of the list!"

The elevator shoots up quickly and seeing NYC being built from the ground up is amazing. Surround sound makes the experience come alive. When you get to the top it is fully enclosed so you don't have to fight the wind like you do at the Empire State Building. Only down side is if you take pictures the camera angle sometimes reflects a glare on the pictures.Take time to sit down and enjoy the show and experience different parts of the city and the different places to explore...very informative. They do have a restaurant up on top and the food looked amazing and better than average."

You then take a lift up to the top Observatory floor 1250 feet up. A film is played and then the screen lifts. No amount of reviews will prepare you for what you then see. I literally cried in awe. The screen will,then drop again and you are taken through the next floor down (where there is a cafe) and given the opportunity to hire a tablet for $15 which shows you where all of the sights are and tells you a bit about the buildings. Then it is down to the next floor for the 360 degree observation and gift shop. The views were magnificent.

It's so hard to be punctual when you're sightseeing and don't know how long it'll take to get places that I do advise this option if you visit. Annoyingly, when we arrived there were no queues anywhere so it wasn't worth it for the 'fast track' option but there were a lot of people arriving as we left so you never know. Everything about the OWO was planned to get maximum dollars out of you. They take your photo as you arrive and try to sell it to you later - you have to walk through the, quite unimpressive, gift shop, and the coffee shop and restaurant are amazingly expensive. There are no seats at the coffee shop, only counters to lean on. If you want to relax and take in the view keep walking through all the points of sale and into the main viewing platform - there are benches at the back. Also be aware that you can politely refuse to get your picture taken at attractions without it creating any trouble and you can often bypass the queue that way. It was a great view but there are plenty of choices in New York for viewing the city so if you only have the time and budget for one, read lots of reviews and make an informed choice."

I purchased our tickets online because I was concerned that there would be long lines; however, we arrived and found only a short wait. Still, having the tickets purchased in advance allowed us to enter very quickly.The building itself is beautiful, and all of the marble in the lobby is quite remarkable. The show really starts in the elevator. Screens on all of the walls show a depiction of the New York area developing throughout time. When you reach the top, you are moved into an area where you are shown a film about the construction of the tower. Upon the conclusion of the film, the walls move up to reveal the dramatic view of New York from over 100 stories up. You then get to spend as much time as you want walking around and viewing the city from all sides. This was an amazing way to see the city and learn about how the tower was constructed. It is also great to do this early in your trip because it will help orient you to the city."

You can also rent interactive Ipads to navigate you around the city.

It took approximately 1 hour of wait time before I was able to get to the elevators to head to the observatory. The elevator ride was enjoyable. The walls light up and are animated. The elevators are quick and before you know it you're already at the top. There's a short presentation and a sales pitch following the video. After the presentation you can take as much time as needed to walk around the observation deck. You have 360 degree views of the city. The views are amazing as it was a clear day. I spent around 45 minutes at the top of building. It took less than 5 minutes to head down the elevator and arrive at ground level."

Having only ever visited the Empire Stare building's observation deck, I was blown away by the much more comprehensive view of New York from the financial district right up to Central Park and beyond as well as a 360 view of Brooklyn, the Statue of Liberty etc.The express lift to the top is exhilarating with the evolving landscape of New York through the years projected around you as you travel. The grand reveal at the top is simply breathtaking and we spent a few hours taking it all in and listening to the guides. I would strongly recommend this on a visit to New York for photo opportunities."

Was not surprised at the 32.00 ticket price (cheaper if you have four people...~25.00 each then). The lines moved quickly and they were well organized. I guess it seemed like the lines moved quickly because you went through a couple of presentations prior to getting tot he actual observatory. I could have done without those and just gotten to the top and have the price been a little cheaper. However, I guess it had its merits because I never felt crammed or rushed as it was paced properly. The ipad presentation/sales pitch right at the end was a little annoying but once we were at the views it was sooo nice. And quiet. Gorgeous views. The fast 45-second elevator ride had a cool video both ways...and up so high our ears popped! Great thing to see but would not need to do again."

Knowing that we wanted to be able to watch the sunset and see the city come alive with lights, we scheduled our trip for just prior to sunset. We were not disappointed. You are able to purchase VIP tickets and bypass part of the line, but we had zero wait time being that our tickets were the last reservations for the night. We walked right in and got on elevator. I suggest not purchasing the VIP tickets as you bypass the elevator and that is part of the experience. Another strong suggestion is NOT to bother with the additional purchase of their iPads. They are a waste of money and really not needed. Bring your camera and enjoy breathtaking views of the entire city, the water and NJ. Please remember though that you aren't the only people there to enjoy the view though and give others a chance at the front of all of the areas. There are plenty for all to enjoy but we did encounter some people sitting on the window ledge (viewing area) either on their phones or texting but NOT taking in the view.

The line moved quite quickly (even through security, where you have to empty your pockets, etc.) and the elevator ride all the way to the 102nd floor took less an a minute. Obviously the 365 degree view at the top is extraordinary. I went just after sunset, so the photos were less than spectacular because of the lighting and the reflections off the glass, so I'd suggest a daytime visit if you're looking for the best photos.My gripe Is with the people who choose to sit at the window and take up space. It was very crowded when I was there (I suspect it's crowded all the time) and there were multitudes of ignorant people who felt the need to sit on the window sills and stare out. I understand that individuals have rights, but if you take up the same space as 3 or 4 people, you're being rude. This is something staff should police a bit, in my mind."

We decided to walk over this way from the Lower East side ( I know crazy but worth it) Even as I walked up, I got a weird sense of calm. For as many people that were trying to buy tickets and enter, it was pretty quiet. Weird right? The tickets came to $64 for the both of us. I do think that is a little expensive but I know that they have to pay for this somehow and it is a tourist attraction, but still. That does not even include the price to go the 9/11 museum. Anyone once you get your ticket, you go downstairs in which your ticket is scanned and you must go through a security screening that is just like as if you were going through airport security. I must say they were pretty thorough as this one gentleman almost had to do a strip search before they let him in. Once you are in, you are huddled along in the corridor in which you are able to see video interviews from people as well as see a few historic things within the building. You are then huddled along to the elevators that will take you up to the 100th floor. Once in the elevator, get a very interesting history lesson of the world trade center (leaving out 2001 of course) up until now. I must say that was a very nice experience to see all the changes that had occurred over the years. You step off and a tour guide explains a view things, and then teases you with a sneak peek of what you will viewing. OMG the view is breath taking. You can definitely see the entire city and then some. It is a total 360 over all of NY! I would love to be up here when the sun rises or even for sets as I can imagine just how gorgeous it is. All the pictures that are posted don't do the views justice (although they are quite good) to see and experience it person is something that you will never forget.Oh one other thing, when you leave and take the elevator back down, you get another history lesson on the way down. The elevator rides alone make for a very cool experience. This is one place everyone should visit at least once if they come and visit New York. The price is a little high, but end the end it is worth it."

This building is so incredible. The elevators are so fast, (make sure you swallow at least 3-5 times on the quick trip up!) The experience is really interactive and unique. I don't want to give anything away about the specifics. Just go and see!I highly recommend going to the website and buying a \"Day Flex Priority\" ticket ($65). It costs more but if you believe time is money (or 2-4 hour waits kill your feet and are a waste of a day) this is worth every extra penny. Buying a day flex lets you walk right into the building and to a short priority, well-managed security line. We were at the observation deck within 15 minutes of walking onto the property at 1:00 on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.The views are unmatched in America and maybe the world because of the beautiful city at which you are taking in from so high above. We had beautiful blue skies on our visit. Do not go in fog/rain (waste of money.)I saw many things in the 5 days I was in New York and this was my favorite. A great memory I will want to relive soon!"

I've traveled to many cities and have always like to see the view from any observatory tower but this production was by far the best of any that I've been to in the past. The whole set up is great. The lift itself is great as are the different screens before the view is revealed. There is obviously plenty to see but there are also tourist stands that do presentations and tell you even more about the city than what you can just see. It is really well presented and worth the entry ticket"

I wanted to go there at the sunset hour, so that we would have enjoyed a nicer view.Unfortunately, even though I followed all tips in their FAQs, to be there in line at least 15 minutes earlier the ticket time, they were late approximately 15-20 minutes on their schedule. This kind of ruined my susnset plan, and I've got quite upset about it.Besides that the place is amazing. The elevator up shows the evolution of the skyline of Manhattan from 1500s onward, and it is amazing. The elevator down also shows a current 3D bird's eye view of the surrounding and it is equally spectacular!Before getting into the obervatory deck, they display a short 2 minutes promotional video of NY in a small, narrow theatre with 3D composite screens, which is kind of touristic, but if you wait till the end you'll remain speechless....."

So much build up with the elevator ride, and then a short intro movie. But at the end of the day, it was your run of the mill observatory--maybe it would have been more exciting in the eve when you can see the city lights. One side was the empire state and midtown(which although beautiful, the empire state gets lots in the rest of the concrete jungle), then theres the jersey side which lets face it, theres nothing to see. Then looking south, an ok view of the statue of liberty/governors island--also just ok. The most beautiful is the eastbound view of the bridges/east river. All in all still enjoyable, but i like being able to step out like the empire state building observatory. nice little cafe/restaurant there at the top also--clearly pricy but hey, what choice do you have! Still a wonderful time, and a proud moment for new yorkers! Let freedom ring!"

The whole experience and the set up was very cool. And the views were amazing. We went there late afternoon and we stayed to see the sunset which was spectacular. It was amazing being able to stand right up against the glass to take pictures. We didn't get the iPads and you don't really need them.

Top of the Rock has the best view as it's open air, loads of room and gaps to take pics without reflection. Statue of Liberty the same but not as much room.The good things about this experience was the organisation and time to the observatory, we did go late (7pm) which may have made a difference but we were upstairs in 10mins.The problem we had was the glass reflected very badly in the dusk/night light so all pictures had the bright lights of the gift shop behind. Also another annoying issue was people sitting on the window sills of every available window as they waited for dusk and night meaning you had to stake 2 metres back and look over them. You couldn't really take pictures with them sitting there.Glad we've done it, ticked the box but wouldn't do again.For those who are interested as it doesn't really make it clear. You can show your tickets on your iphone/smart phone for scanning and we didn't need ID to show who we were. The tickets were in the name Guest."

The video in the elevator is fantastic but too short to take in and with the elevator a bit crowded it is hard to appreciate it all. So make sure to be ready looking at the wall and pay attention not to miss anything. Once out the elevator, try to get in the front by the rail looking at the wall so that when the shutters go up you have the best view of the city. That first glimpse is very emotional and gave me chills! Afterwards you're led into the observatory where you can walk around at your own pace and take in the 360\u00ba views. Best to buy tickets in advance as they are timed entrances. But once you are up there, you can stay as long as you want. It's a must see if in New York!"

The only thing I didn't like was it was very commercial. It looked like a Disney tour to start off. They wanted you to stop and have a picture made like cruise ships do. Then they herded you into another area to sell you a iPad tour. It's a beautiful sight in spite of all this. We had to go around twice to make sure we didn't miss anything.

As with Top of the Rock we decided to visit OWO in the morning and we pre booked tickets for 10am, we arrived and went straight through and up to the top no waiting. The elevator ride up shows you an amazing cinematic of New York being built up over the decades, and when you reach the top you get a little bit of history then the grand unveiling of the skyline. The view are fantastic all around although most people were round the north side. It was quiet for a good 20mins before getting busier so my advise is to go early. You can see everything from Brooklyn Bridge to Empire state building to State of Liberty. The trip down is quite cool, again a video ride.Having visited One World Observatory and Top of the Rock, I would visit both again but rate One World a little higher, its a bit more expensive but the views are unrivalled and its feels a bit more special, as in there's no doubt that the view is the main attraction!"

It is nice to be able to see Statue of Liberty so close and Brooklyn Bridge (best views of both these here) but apart from this there is very little else.You can see Empire state and look up the Hudson but you almost only have a 180 degree view as the other 180 degrees are out to see.

The elevator ride is so fast it's hard to believe, & you don't really feel much acceleration. Once at the top you have the option of renting a special iPad that you point at the views as you walk all around. It then names the famous buildings & places & for you can click on some of the names & a virtual helicopter flight takes you to it with a voice giving a brief story. It cost me $15.00 in March 2016. It works well, but it's a bit of a gimmick & for me, not worth it. The views from the observation deck are worth it.You walk around staring through huge floor to ceiling windows at spectacular views of some of the most famous landmarks in the world. For me, the high ticket price was was forgotten. I spent about 2 hours slowly moving right around. Just fascinating & you can see all 5 boroughs of New York. If visibility is good, you can see the state of Connecticut & look across the Hudson River to New Jersey & Pennsylvania beyond that. If it's really good visibility you can even see the Catskills.This amazing view over New York puts everything into perspective & I highly recommend a visit."

As the newest of the new, One World Observatory at the World Trade Center does a great job of building the experience. The elevator ride to the 102nd floor is unrivaled in my experience. Sure, others have glass elevators that allow you to see the city falling away from you, but OWO makes the trip to the top interesting by showing how the city has evolved from its humble beginnings as a quiet island--all on the LCD paneled walls of their Sky Pod Elevators. Once off the elevator, there's a short video presentation of NYC, at the end of which the wall rises and gives you a breathtaking view of the city. Again, great presentation.What I didn't care for at all is that-unlike other observation decks to which I've been-there are no markers on the floor or elsewhere that tell you what it is that you are seeing. I mean, this in New York City; sure, I can pick out the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and the Woolworth Building (maybe). But what about the hundreds of other landmarks? Oh, right: there's the Statue of Liberty and (by association) Ellis Island, but without the $15 rental of the iPad (the One World Explorer)? That's about all you're going to recognize, kid. The iPad definitely made the visit more enjoyable; I can only imagine how dull the trip would've been without it. As for City Pulse (their interactive concierge): that was pretty good. The live Tour Ambassador rattles off impressive facts and figures about the city and its diverse neighborhoods. It's clear that a lot of thought (and money) went into every aspect of OWO. It's an unforgettable visit that begs to be experienced, and perhaps you will not share my scintilla of disappointment. Shoot, ;you may not have even noticed had I not mentioned it (sorry to spoil it for you).In short, I'd expect a grander experience from New York City.

Afterwards we did the pools from the old twin towers, they have done a good job, blending the old and the new. Tasteful which sometimes our American cousins don't always get right."

My views may be different than that of a tourist. I actually found myself tearing up in the elevator on the way to the top, as I remembered the last time I went to Windows on the World. The memories are now somewhat bittersweet. We went on a Thursday night around 8pm and the line was surprisingly short. The views cannot be beat, with the SOL, ESB, Times Square, and all of Brooklyn, Queens and NJ on display. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area or staying close by."

Yes it has height and significance but the world up there is blue and less than clear thanks to coloured glass and no chance of any exterior deck view. The principle vantage points are obscured by presentation stages. Then there is the mandatory wait while they try to rent you an ipad and take and sell you your souvenir photo. Perhaps the best thing of the whole adventure is the video during the elevator rides up and down. If you can go up to only one observation deck my vote is 30 Rock."

The observatory itself takes the whole floor, you can circle around the floor and watch the city from all directions, the glass is clean and transparent. The views are not as good as those from the Empire State because it's much farther away from midtown but still it was worth the visit. You can stay as much as you want, there is a souvenir shop and a restaurant there. You can sit by the windows near the floor and enjoy some serenity while looking at the city.

Staff is polite and professional. The quick, non-stop elevator ride to the top of the building is a masterpiece in its own right: rising above the original Manhattan natural landscape and development through the ages. Genious. On the way down, another emotional ride as it really feels like descending from the outside of the tower. What I noticed and particularly appreciated is that there is no reference nor attachment to the sadly missed Twin Towers; not because they should be ignored but because, in a way, I felt that it could have been awkward. The atmosphere here is all about positivity, moving forward and simply enjoying one of the most amazing views in the whole world. The way to go! Amazing place."

On a clear day this will be a brilliant experience. There was lots of room to lounge about and take pictures but I did not bother with the I-Pad experience available at extra charge.There are two presentations given on an innovative circular set of screens, that are very well done. I learned a lot about the Big Apple and surroundings during my couple of hours here. Mr Fontana is a great presenter and will answer any questions you have.This was definitely an entertaining visit although a bit sad when you consider the events of 2001.

Whilst the view really is stunning, in honesty, I prefer the Empire State Building because you have a much more immersive view of Manhattan, not to mention that you cannot see Central Park behind the Empire State Building from the vantage point. The transition from day to night is more spectacular from the Empire State because it's so much closer to Times Square, which really grabs your attention. Also, I think the Ipad hire is a bit gimmicky, but I'm sure it adds to the experience.It's definitely a worthwhile experience, especially when combined with the 9/11 Memorial and Museum."

The staff and presentation and very informative and the friendly. The trip in the elevator only takes less than a minute and will make your ears pop. So much better than viewing the city from the Empire building as you have to look through fencing - this building has large glass panels. Recommend this tour to all visitors of New York."

You cannot see Central Park though because other buildings are actually blocking the park's view, and you slightly can see the Empire State Building. However, this is a great observatory and a must-do experience in the city! The elevator ride itself was pretty fun as well because during our ascend the elevator walls have projected the history of how the city and all its buildings were constructed - it was really cool. You have a restaurant upstairs with all the view (It might be an expensive one.. and touristy..)There is an option to purchase a ticket with an additional $18 for a champagne glass - I wouldn't recommend to purchase the champagne because after half an hour of going around the observatory you pretty much want to go back down. Moreover, you can go grab drinks in any other bar around there and it would cost much less.."

We came out of the subway and looked straight up at the building. We walked to the north side of the building where all those who are going to visit the observatory must enter. Security is strict and it is as though you were going through TSA security at the airport. We entered the elevator and began a 47 second trip up to the top. You are given a short video of the beginning of NYC and its growth up to the present. This is displayed on the walls of the elevator. It is kind of cool! Upon arriving at the top, you enter the highest level of the observatory. There are three levels to the observatory. The restaurant is on the middle level The lowest level is the exploratory area where you can walk around 360 degrees and see all 5 boroughs of NYC. You can purchase a device that will tell you the names of all the important buildings in NYC. There are two presentations (both the same but on opposite sides of the area) given which explain many things about the city including people, buildings, architecture, restaurants, etc. There are docents all around who direct or explain all aspects of the observatory. A must see event if you are in NYC. We went on a rainy day, but the clouds were high enough so that our views were not cloudy. Also see my review of the restaurant."

They have available ($15) tablet devices that identify buildings and locations that are visible. We did not get one but did see quite a few people using them. The viewing room is large and handled the crowd size nicely at the time we visited (arrived at 9:15 AM). Unlike, the former World Trade Center, this view is entirely inside.We enjoyed our visit but having been to the former WTC observatory, the Empire State Building observatory and the one at Rockefeller Center, it wasn't all that spectacular.

I had a read a few negative reviews that mentioned waiting hours in line, but a simple call ahead confirmed there was no wait to get to the top. We walked through a pretty long maze of queues and bypassed a few videos and signs that were intended to occupy those waiting on busier days and went straight to the elevator. The ride up the elevator was pretty cool, as all four walls are covered with video monitors and as you rise in height, the view travels through time with the various buildings that would be visible. When you make it to the top you watch a brief video and get your first glimpse of the view, which is quite honestly breathtaking. You then go to a demonstration of the interactive iPads they have available for rent that point out the various sights when held up to the window. To me, it was well worth the $15 to rent one out and it added a lot to the experience. You then go to the observatory which is very open and spacious. You can walk the perimeter to take in a 360 degree view and can even look down to see the reflecting pools where the former towers stood. It was a somewhat awe inspiring experience and I'm glad that my family had a chance to check it out."

It was surprisingly a very fast ride. If you are motion sensitive it will make you feel woozy for a little bit. Once your on the observatory there are 2 things...1 the obligatory group picture. And second an opportunity to rent an iPad device to tell you about the views you are watching. This was an additional fee. I think the price of $30 something a ticket should have included the device. Once your up and observing it is beautiful. We were lucky and ere was not a cloud in the sky and you could see for miles. You are not outdoors so weather will not impact you other than sight.

The bird's eye views of Manhattan, Jersey, and Staten Island may be cool to some, but it's too difficult to make out anything to make it a worthwhile venture to me. The coolest part was the elevator ride up that shows a CGI time lapse of the Manhattan skyline, but even that isn't as mesmerizing as advertised. See if you can find a Youtube video of it and save your money.By comparison, The Rock is close enough to the rest of the skyline (in proximity and height) to be a more intimate and memorable experience.

Each time we returned to NYC we were able to see the progress on this building and finally it was open and we were able to go up to see the spectacular view. We have been to the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock other years and enjoyed all three for their different aspects of the city. We especially loved the video presentation of the history of NYC as we ascended the tower. I would have loved to do that several times to see it all again as it goes by so quickly. The short presentation at the top is also very spectacular before you actually see the view of the city. We were fortunate to have a glorious autumn day so the views were breathtaking. We enjoyed a visit to the gift shop and picked up a couple souvenirs before leaving - altogether spending about an hour and a half.My husband and I had standard admission tickets, pre booked online. We went on a Saturday. I would recommend a 9 am ticket as the queues are much shorter and when you do get to the top, there are not so many people. We were able to see all the views and get great photos before the crowds arrived. For this reason we visited the 9/11 Museum and OWO on two separate days - a 9 am timeslot was ideal for us for both."

We visited on a perfectly clear day with visibility of at least 25 miles, so the whole of the city and beyond was on display.

Once outside the lift, the walls of the room gave us a look at New York city life, and when the screens lifted to reveal the view over the city it was a breath-taking moment. Had a few drinks in the bar until the sun was about to set when the buildings of the city, tinged with an orange glow, looked just stunning.Of course, it is a reminder of what happened on this site on that terrible day, but it is something that New York and America can be proud of."

The elevator ride up and down--as the walls magically morph through 400 years of history from New Amsterdam until today--is the high point. Unfortunately this imaginative introduction passes so quickly you can't fully appreciate it. Once you get to the top its pure hucksterism. First, you're forced to wait in front of another video presentation of hackneyed images of New York City life, at the end of which the screens roll up to reveal the real world outside (really cheesy), and then you're shepherded into a room and made to listen to a pitch by an eager young salesperson about the marvels of an iPad-like device that you can take with you to the observation area and which will mirror what you're seeing, allowing you to click on any building or other item you'd like more information about. It's a great idea! And it's only $15! The observation floor itself is pretty non-descript--the expected food outlets (most likely over-priced--I didn't check), and the window areas mostly filled with people taking selfies.$32 for this is absurd. It's especially galling for those of us who remember the original World Trade Center's low-key observation deck. There are other, better options for such views of Manhattan, although all of them are more and more about selling items and add-ons along the way."

We still have great memories standing atop of the South tower taking in the magnificent views, so visiting the One World Observatory - World Trade Center now that it is finished was a must visit on this trip.We didn\u2019t pre-book but simply turned up on a lovely sunny morning for our visit, there was no queue at all so purchased our tickets and went straight in. After we had gone through the \u201cairport style\u201d security we were whizzed up to the observation deck at super-fast speed (serious ear popping stuff!!).On arrival you are taken to a theatre to watch a very interesting production, at this point I won\u2019t mention anything else as it will spoil it for others. From there you go to the main observation floor to take in the magnificent views, you can hire an interactive tablet that gives real time information of the places/buildings of interest outside. There were also two staff talks on either side which were very interesting and were cleverly done.There are tour guides available to answer your questions of which I had a few. One thing that did surprise me, even though the new tower is 1776 feet tall, the observation floor is actually 100 feet LOWER than the original observation deck on the South tower. It would also have been nice to be able stand on the roof of the new tower as you could the old South tower. The problem we found taking photos is that you get \u201cwindow reflection\u201d plus some pillars also got in the way (the Shard in London is the same).The elevator ride back down is also an experience in itself, again I won\u2019t spoil it for you. All-in-all a must visit when in NYC and I thought the $32 entrance fee was well worth it, just pick a bright sunny day (or clear evening) for your visit."

This meant we could skip the long queue at security for a fast track line through the checks. The lift ride up is amazing and the video show at the top is executed brilliantly - I won't ruin any surprises. Just have your camera ready.

We were guided through security, and then into the elevators, which had a wee interesting twist. On leaving the elevators we were then shown a short film. The view on a sunny Sat morning was outstanding, we could see for miles in every direction. I LOVED it and would definitely go back for the WOW factor and to \"See Forever\""

We booked o line before travelling and planned to visit the observatory after we had been to the 911 Memorial/Museum but the weather had other plans and the top of the tower was in the cloud and the staff said it was not worth going to the top and we could exchange our tickets for another day. We re-booked for the next morning and despite arriving before our time slot there was no problem getting in (9.30 am) and no queue.The whole experience was superb. I wont go into too much detail as I don't want to spoil it for others, but from entering the high speed elevator to getting to the observation deck is brilliantly done. The views from the top are awesome. We spent about 4 hours on the observation deck as there was no limit to how long you could stay. We hired an iPad/ tablet that highlights the landmarks below as you point it out of the window. There are also staff talks on various subjects about New York, with the cost of property quite an eye opener.There is a caf\u00e9/bar and shop on the upper floor of the observation deck."

The line at 11:30am on a Saturday morning was a breeze. We purchased tickets and walked right on to the elevators downstairs. The elevator ride is quick, and shows a video on the walls as you ascend to the top. Little kids may have problems viewing the video if there are a lot of adults on the lift. Once at the top you are funneled into a room with blocky walls on one side. A short \"yay America\" video is displayed, and then the curtains rise to show the view from the top. A little hokey and over done, but hey...you did just pay $30.00 for an elevator ride.After a few (minutes or seconds) the curtains go back down and you are funneled over to the picture taking...we skipped this souvenir...and attempted to get over to the restaurant, which is a winding walk through the cafe and gifts. After our lunch we enjoyed the views from all sides of the observation level. It's a great place to visit for the young and old!!"

It goes some way to repay the $32 entrance fee by shooting you up 104 floors in approximately 48 seconds as smooth as silk, whilst showing the construction New York in film snippets on the lift walls. Once there you can stand in the centre of the building on glass floor and look at the yellow cabs and all.The only thing that could be better for myself is that you don't get to walk outside and feel the height and the wind..... At the top of the Empire State Building you can."

The visit is well organized and very efficient. But I couldn't escape from the feeling that the entrepreneurs, are first of all very interested in my wallet. It costs 32 US$ per person, but before getting into the observatory, you are faced to an aggresive marketing of a guide tablet, make pictures in an artificial background, as an expensive souvenir of your visit and other commercial sales. This is actually a memorandum and of the victims and as so, annoying"

Even the walls of the elevator itself are part of the show, during the incredibly fast 60-second rise to the top. When the elevator opens you'll get another very short show in a small room...and then the wall goes up dramatically and you are left staring awe-struck at the most unbelievable view. It takes your breath away, honestly. The observation deck is a 2-3 floor area with floor to ceiling windows and a 360\u00b0 view...bring the best camera you have, but even the worst will get you amazing shots. You can rent a tablet that you can use to point to anything you see outside and it will tell you what it is and give you a bit of info on it."

At $32US per person it is not cheap, but is one of the best views you will ever see.One of the best experiences is the elevator ride up - as surround graphics on the elevator walls illustrate the history of New York island.There is a little of a corny suspense thing once you reach the top, but theatrics aside the view is amazing. It s a must see as you have uninterrupted panorama of the entire Manhattan Island and surrounds. We had a clear day and t was fabulous.The elevator ride down has the walls give the impression of a Willy Wonka elevator ride.All in all a must see when you visit fabulous New York."

This is NYC so as with all major attractions be prepared to stand in a queue - this didn't bother us at all. What lets this place down is people plonking their butts on the windowsills and not moving along. We went up about 5.30pm and literally was about 2m back from the windows as people just sat down and didn't move to let others get photos. In the end I asked a girl to move as her and her 5 friends were sitting for 15mins taking selfies uploading on social media and chit chatting. They want to manage this better, people shouldn't be allowed to do this. Also - all the money that was spent on this building I can't believe they didn't use non reflective glass in the observatory. As soon as it starts to get dark you see reflections of light from gift shop etc in your photos! I liked it - and it's worth a visit but sort out the windowsill hoggers! "

My kids loved the elevator ride which shows you the building of New York through time as you go up. The reason I only rated it a four happened as soon as we got off the elevator. First they wanted to take your picture which you then pay for if you want a copy. We didn't get our photo taken so I'm not sure how much it is. Then they try to get you to cough up another $15 for an iPad with an explorer app on it that will give you information about the city. It looked awesome and of course my kids wanted it but I felt after spending $90 to get up here something like that should have been included or maybe $5. My family had a great time and the views of the city are amazing. There are 3 dining options in the observatory if you're hungry.

The biggest downside is the design of the three floors- who forgot bathrooms of adequate size? We got to the top after an almost 30 minute wait on line and through a quick movie, so a few people needed facilities.Walk into the men's room and two stalls and two urinals? What?

We had just visited the Museum which was incredibly emotional. This visit showed the American spirit and that of all New Yorkers (of which I am one).1) It will cost you about $ 32 US each and in my humble opinion so worth it! I have been to the top of the Empire State building and the Top of the Rock and this in my opinion is the best. I will give honorable mention to Top of the Rock as you can get outside with open views.2) The elevator ride brings you through a timeline beginning in the earliest times and show you the progression of a timeline as you go higher. It is simply awesome!! At the end of the elevator, you get out and they show you a video montage of NY. Then the walls open and you are blown away by the sudden and spectacular view of Manhattan!3) By all means, rent the ipad which is $15 US. It allows you to see and understand the 360 view of the city and beyond. Places are highlighted and you can touch those and fly to the spot where you will get a historical background of the place.4) There is food at the top. Deli sandwiches where you can stand at tables or sit down restaurant. We were going out to eat later so we did the standing. The restaurant look amazing. The prices for food were expensive, but hey your in NY:-)From your friendly New Yorker - visit the One World Observatory, you won't regret it!"

Nevertheless, there are staff everywhere on the observatory floor to answe questions, including a historian. They invite questions in an enthusiastic manner and are all quite competent. Views are spectacular though with an enclosed cueing area, you do have to contend with pillars. Nevertheless, the crowd moves wee enough that you have an unobstructed view of the city and New Jersey. We were fortunate to have been there when there wasn't a cloud in the sky; the views were simply awesome. We booked ahead of our visit for a timed entry and skipped a long line at the ticket booth.

A really great experience. The one down side is how reflective the windows are makes it difficult to take totally clear pics"

Great looking 'modern building', and yes I enjoyed it, but being a keen amateur photographer I was disappointed there was no outside viewing, all inside behind glass.That glass can cause problems if you want a clean image, there seemed to be some kind of heated element within the glass that can spoil your images.On the plus side the cafe is reasonable with its pricing and that was a pleasant surprise in NYC."

I won't ruin the surprise, but it's definitely worth a trip up. The great thing about the tower is it doesn't bombard you with the 9/11 history and it leaves that to the museum, this is just a great observation deck in a great building."

Once up, there's a fantastic movie presentation that ends with a big surprise (don't want to spoil it). And then the observation floor is unbelievable. It's all indoors too, so no cold wind. The views are amazing and this is definitely worth the stiff price tag. Only downer? The sales pitch they make you sit through before letting you go to the observatory. Tacky."

Unfortunately the day I picked (you need to specify day and time of your visit) was extremely foggy and I was informed that the there was zero visibility. Staff was very helpful and I was quickly able to have my ticket reissued for the following day by guest services. I went on my lunch break on a Wednesday and there were no line ups at all. Staff told me the busiest time of day is around sunset.The short elevator ride to floor 102 is impressive as it shows images of the changing landscape of NYC over the past couple hundred years. It takes a few minutes to get to the observation area as they want to take everyone's picture (to sell you later as a souvenir) and then try to rent you an IPad for $15 to assist in identifying what you are looking at down below. The view is spectacular, although entirely from inside glass so some reflections if you take pictures. Would definitely recommend visiting while in NYC."

I rank One World Trade Center (Freedom Tower) first, followed by the Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center) a close second. The views from both of these observation decks are magnificent, the staffs are friendly, the decks are very spacious, and the lineups for the elevators are well organized. In contrast, the Empire State Building is crowded, verging on chaotic, and, unless you play in the NBA, the views from the observation deck usually feature the heads and shoulders of strangers. The views from Freedom Tower and Top of the Rock are very different; the former featuring sweeping panoramas of Liberty Island, Staten Island and New Jersey as well as Manhattan. The Top of the Rock offers magnificent views of Central Park to the north and the towers of Manhattan to the south. If time allows, visit both; if time is tight, pick the one situated close to other sights you wish to visit. In either event, you won't be disappointed."

Purchasing the tickets online was very easy, with plenty of time slots to reserve. We reserved a time of 5:15 pm, to be at the top in time to see everything, and also see the sunset, and the NY City twinkling lights at night. The timing was perfect. When we entered Global Welcome Center, as our tickets were scanned, our state of Missouri was highlighted on the huge global map, and \"Missouri\" stayed lit up for a few moments. Very cool. The walkway to the elevator, at the bedrock, with the personal stories of the people who built the Tower, was very moving. The elevator ride to the top was nothing short of amazing, as the walls of the elevator transformed into perfectly clear scenes of the time-lapse of NYC from 1500's through today. Upon exiting the elevator, there is a floor to ceiling, wall to wall screen of another amazing video of NYC, which seems like you're looking outside. At 2 minutes, this amazing screen raises up to reveal the windows that look out over NYC from the Observatory. A photo was taken of the 4 of us, which we didn't think we'd buy, but when we saw at as we were leaving, we couldn't pass it up. We went to the welcome desk where we were greeted by staff, and we rented the One World Explorer that gave interesting additional information about buildings we were looking at from the windows. We actually didn't use this very much. It was interesting, but there was plenty to see without it. The views were incredible from all of the 360 degree windows. The sunset was beautiful. Seeing the building lights and lines of red auto lights going up and down the NYC streets was breathtaking. We had a drink at the restaurant, enjoyed the view awhile longer, and left after 3 hours of taking our time and taking it all in. There was hardly anyone there as we were leaving, so we asked the elevator staff if we could ride the elevator back up and down to get the experience again, which we did. Truly amazing! We took some incredible photos looking up at the tower when we were leaving. We went to the Reflecting Pools, which are so powerful. There was a white rose and a red rose placed over a name - brought tears to my eyes. The Museum was closed for the night, but we could see in the huge windows, the huge iron trident from the Towers. Awe-inspiring. This was an experience we will never forget."

I think the fact that we were there in February really made it better. They are obviously geared to deal with the large crowds of summer and the nicer months. Our bonus. I expect to go back and will pay the extra to get the Ipod next time for $20. When you look anywhere it shows you what you are looking at and other details.

The WTC Observatory had just opened this year and the presentation of the history of the 9/11 events and the rebuilding of the WTC are a very powerful story. I was really surprised at how such a large building could bring the individual stories of the loss of 9/11 to life. The people who created the tourist experience did an amazing job. While many hundreds of people were touring I didn't feel rushed or crowded but it was September and on a weekday. Overall it is a destination that cannot be missed. The memorial in the courtyard is as amazing as the Vietnam Memorial. I had a very similar feeling in NYC as I did when viewing the Vietnam Memorial some 25 years ago as a teen."

It is impressive to think that in a matter of seconds you will reach floor 102. What follows is very unpleasant, and you feel in a forced Disneyland. Grandiose music in a darkish room, the curtains are unveiled and you get a sneak peak (less than 10 seconds) of the view. After the slogan yelled out in off voice, they close the curtains in a matter of seconds and thank you for your visit. Then they will force you to pose for the souvenir picture, and push you an Ipad for 15USD to map the city. They will invite you to continue consuming at the cafeteria.I asked the guides for information on the next steps, and they did not provide more information. So I thought that was it and was quite disappointed. But in the end you actually can go down to floor 100 where you can enjoy the gorgeous view. If you do not know New York well, the ipad thingy is not a bad idea and can be really useful. Overall, the visit is very much worth it, as a tourist and as a New York resident, but you have to bare with the showmania and the greedy nature of the visit. Once you pass beyond that, it is truly quite nice. I would make the experience more New York (less Epcot Center). The city speaks for itself, no need to add music and visuals. I would sell the ipad after the guests have enjoyed a bit of the view and realise it is quite handy. And mostly I would tweak the veil/curtain 30-second show and leave the curtains open (close them after the group has left). Cause otherwise it feels like an insult to your intelligence and to your wallet. The view helps to forget it but it takes a while to recover from the tourist-trap syndrome.One added star for the accessibility: We did it with a stroller, and there were only 3 steps we needed to overcome.If you buy online dont worry about printing the tickets, you can do that at the booth with your reservation number."

Having completed Empire state and the Rockefeller centre, on my latest visit to NYC I had to go for the New York trilogy and gosh its was wow!What I have to say is that the service provided here is first class, on the original day of a pre planned visit the cloud cover was that low that you couldn't even see the top of the World Trade and we were advised that the viewing floor was closed and offered a no quibble refund or rebooking at our preferred date and time, this we did with no hassle and returned 48 hours later.The experience is slick starting in the foundations of the World trade centre with interesting information, then a high speed lift going up 107 floors, you have an option for hiring a fully interactive tablet guide which is a optional extra (what I appreciated was they explained have they worked without forcing the item on to you top marks for that) to give you more information or you can just discover for yourself.The view is trying something giving views of downtown, Brooklyn and New Jersey that you can't get anywhere else.The efficiency and value of this venue really stand out for me, if your in NYC it's well worth visiting the highest building in the western hemisphere and see how far you can see!"

It's a little deceptive that you start out on 102 to be sold on rental an electronic viewer, then down to 101 where you can buy food/drink and then, finally, down to 100 for the actual observation deck. The best view to the north is blocked by a huge piece of electronics that, presumably, costs extra to use -- didn't bother to check. On a bright day, photos can be a little tough due to the reflections of the pillars and people behind you on the windows."

My wife and I visited One World Observatory with another couple over the long President's Day weekend and on the day that we visited, the skies were crystal clear for as far as one could see. There simply aren't enough superlatives to describe the views. The cost is on the high side, but when one considers that all staff members are salaried so that they can be thoroughly vetted before working in the building, the cost doesn't seem as bad, especially when one considers the tight security that is apparent everywhere. The security is nearly identical to what we all experience at airports all over America. There are trained staff available on the floor of the observatory to answer questions about the building and anything/everything about what is in any particular view. The viewing level provides a complete 360 degree view. We easily spent about two hours taking pictures and just standing and staring at the views. Although there are lines to go to the top and again to return to the ground level, the procedures keep neither of the groups ever get tangled up and the lines move quite quickly and smoothly. For those who don't enjoy long elevator rides, the time on board is very brief; however, it was just long enough for my ears to pop three times each way. The experience is superb for all members of the family and is a \"must do\" when in New York City - we heartily recommend the One World Observatory at the World Trade Center."

            "review": "Unbelievably well done from the moment you walk in on the ground floor. Took my 2+ yr old grandson who lives in Brooklyn. Chose early time on a Sunday, so there were no crowds. Grandson was a little timid with the revolving entry door and within seconds he was comforted by no fewer than 5 friendly staff members. An hour and a half later when we left they greeted him on a first name basis at the door. He also balked a bit on the escalator down from the top floor to the observatory deck and was instantly helped by a staff member. All the positive comments in the other reviews are so true (won't repeat them here). Wish I had been a little better prepared for the extraordinary elevator video history experience. So much to see going up and back down. Do some homework on NYC and NJ geography to get the full benefit of the experience. The quality of the facility and its audio/video apparatus is over the top. Be sure and stop to listen to the live video presentations. The presenters are very well informed and skilled in answering all sorts of questions. Grandson liked the Skyport the most. Without exception every staff member we encountered was friendly, courteous and helpful. While the views are memorable, I will also not forget how well we were treated. Finally, while the observatory is devoted to taking advantage of the views, it is impossible to overlook the tragedy that took place at that very site - don't miss the memorials."

Shame there is no offer of e-ticket to your phone.Anyway, there was no queue, just a simple security check and you're int to the elevator. What a way to start the whole experience. I won't spoil it but if you really want to know you can see it on youtube. 102 floors in 60 seconds, and you don't feel as if you're even moving. Once you alight you are presented with a video wall and then you move through to the observatory, but you must pass the obligatory 'upset' of an iPad virtual tour guide for $15!!!Once past this you move down a level into the observatory itself which is an open level with 360 degree views."

The adventure starts with the video wall giving you information about the people who helped construct the tower and what it means to them and to New York in general. This is down in the basement level, and gives a real sense of the bedrock of the structure itself. Follow this with the terrific lift journey showing you New York's creation, and allowing you to forget about the height you are climbing at a rapid speed, and before you know it you are up on the observatory level. The start of this part of the 'journey' is also well thought out, and gives a stunning introduction to the views - no spoilers here - you have to experience it to know what I mean. Next onto the only 'sales pitch' bit of the observatory, the offer to use individual iPads giving an interactive commentary of what you are seeing. No longer do you have to carry a black box and wear earphones, this is a fully interactive tour that shows you the views you are looking at, and gives interesting information about the key buildings you can see. And it is GREAT! definitely worth the $15 it cost us when visiting. Of course it goes without saying that the views were phenomenal, although we were incredibly lucky and had the clearest day's weather since it had opened. Not so sure what it would be like on a cloudy or rainy day. Finally, (and see separate review for this too), if you want to eat up there, and can afford a bit more than canteen food prices, then definitely book into the One-on-One restaurant. The food was amongst the best we had in NY (and we had some great food!), reasonably priced and you get to see the great views while you eat. We were lucky enough to be seated above where the guides were giving talks about NY, but as these were well worth listening and were very entertaining and informative we didn't mind. Can highly recommend to anyone who wants to visit NY and see the sites from up high."

Maybe it's just me, but I think that became a little too much. If you ignore the efforts to sell all the extras this is well worth a visit."

The view all around the city are stunning, with some interactive bits at 2 ends. The only issue with the views is the glare from the windows which is only a problem when you take photos (especially at night).

You understand what it means to them to have worked on it, their own personal NY history and how proud they are of the work done. It was, for me, the best part. Sure the views were great, but understanding how it's very existence impacts the everyday of the people of the city is in fact outstanding."

We arrived for our scheduled visit on Tuesday morning to find the observatory closed, but the staff were really helpful and we rebooked for an early evening trip the following day. The whole experience was spectacular. The staff were friendly and cheerful and even the security experience was pleasant with the staff engaging with you as you went through. The ride in the lift to the observation deck was great fun and although I groaned when we were led into an area for the introductory film/spiel - I just wanted to get out and see the view, it was actually one of the highlights of the visit. I'll not spoil it by saying why!The views from the top are incredible; we were lucky that it was not too busy and were able to spend a good hour or more just enjoying the city from every angle.We enjoyed the guides in the circular booths giving information about the city - well worth the five minutes or so to listen. We did learn that the reason the observatory was closed the day before was not only the visibility as we had been led to believe but the really strong winds which stopped the elevators from working. Having been blown along the pavements by them, we could understand this!!!The only disappointment - the restaurant kitchen was closed and we couldn't have dinner as I had hoped so probably worth checking ahead. The bar was open though however as I was travelling with a teenager, a visit was not an option."

            "review": "well done!. i live in NY but if you are a tourist and want to really get NY , you do two things first: Place the city in space and go to the top of the Freedom tower (one world trade center) and place the city in its historical context and you go to ellis island. After this, you can start visiting NY. the top of the Freedom tower is an great experience from the moment you step in the elevator till you get out of it on the way down. it is all enclosed contrarily to the old world trace center but it is extremely clear with windows from bottom to ceiling all around. I found the experience much better organized and friendly. at two opposite sites, there is a station where a guide will tell you all about NY from its history, to the ethnic group and food, to the main sights. You can ask what you want to hear about. It is also well done . It is not cheap at $35/person but it is well worth spending 2 hours up there. i loved it. and if you have kids they will love it. you can eat in a restaurant with a great view as well, accessible from the observatory. the food is good and the price while not expensive is not exorbitant. i would advice to come there early if you want a table. when you are finished (or before you go) stroll in the memorial garden at the food of the tower and enjoy the beauty of the tower itself."

Great to see boats going up and down the rivers, e.g. the Staten Island Ferry. I went in winter in the morning and was able to get good enough photos through the windows without reflections. If you only wanted to go up one tower, I would definitely suggest Top of the Rock, as you get better views (Central Park one way, Empire State and World Trade Centre the other way) and better photos because it is outside. However, I spent a couple of hours at the top as the views were still memorising and the benefit of it being inside is it is warm! There were very informative talks by members of staff. I was one of the first up with no queuing after buying a ticket at 9am. One of the security guards was incredibly rude though - I arrived to get my ticket at 8.30am as the website said tickets went on sale then. Despite that, they were not open and the security guard made me wait outside in the freezing cold."

Inside there is a spot were you can listen to various 10 to 15 minutes pinpoint explanations , from volunteer guides, regarding a particular NY neighborhood . A visit to New York cannot be completed without being there. BUT they charge 32$ for entry only. AND they are not providing with this price any orientation map or placing any explanations to the main sights you see. If you want a very good modern explanation you need to spend another 15$ to rent a special tablet with an excellent application. Despite the high entry fee go there and prepare yourself with a map r other explanation or be ready to extra 15$. A couple should be ready to spend 80-90$ for a visit."

The observatory is ample with lots of room to walk around and see all the different sections of the area using as a guide the cardinal points. You can spend hours just looking at all the point of interests and just looking at the traffic on the water as well as on land. There are 3 venues to have food as well.

Check on the official site or with your hotel concierge. Even if discounts are not available, purchasing tickets in advance will save time.Visitors enter through the doors facing West Street, and then head down escalators to the lower level. From there you are directed to one of two queues for the security checkpoint - think airport level security minus photo ID check. The queue to the right is marked VIP which is available for an up-charge that is a time saver but a potentially off-putting one. The amount of time you can expect to save will depend on how many people are waiting in the standard ticket queue. Once beyond security, visitors move onward to the passageways that lead to the elevators. Here is where the tedium begins. The passageways are lined in a fake decorative bedrock that is supposed to mimic the bedrock of Manhattan. As the WTC site is on landfill, this is at a minimum misleading. There are video presentations where you will hear stories from the construction workers, some intentionally sentimental. I would have preferred to see a presentation on the process of getting to the executed architectural design. Another video presentation that shows how the WTC view has changed over the years from past to present is on the elevator walls. This is spectacular. When you finally arrive you will be asked to wait. Again. For another video presentation. At this point I wondered if I would ever see the view that I paid for. This presentation had nothing to do with the WTC. It would have seemed a more relevant thing to show to tourists waiting to board a double-decker bus that would take them to see... tourist spots. That final presentation ends in walls moving to reveal the view.The view is fantastic. You won't be disappointed. I resented the process to get to see it. I can't imagine locals will feel differently. I witnessed a few kids having meltdowns and adult tourists loosing their patience.I compared this observation deck to the one at the previous tower as I took in the view. It is completely different. The building is different. The view is different. The city is now different (than it was in 2001). This observation deck, similar to the characterization of today's Times Square - has been Disney-fied."

Be careful what time you go because it looks like you can be stuck in line for a very long line. I went with two small children and they enjoyed everything. We ended up eating at the restaurant on top, the food was good but the restaurant was not kid friendly. I will definite skip the restaurant in the future if I have my kids with me."

As a \"New Yorker\", I have mixed emotions about doing the \"touristy\" stuff like going up to the top of the Empire State building or visiting the Statue of Liberty, so I've been putting off visiting One World Observatory, despite waking up to a view of One World Trade every morning. But a few weeks ago, I found myself waking up extra early with nothing to do, so I decided to stop by and check it out. Lucky for me, I got there at 9:30am on a particularly cold Saturday so there was absolutely no line, all the more reason to go in. And I'm so glad I did. The experience is so much more than just views of Manhattan, which can be stunning on a clear day, or even a gloomy day like that Saturday. I did not know what to expect so I was pleasantly surprised with all the history and visuals leading up to the ascent to the 102nd floor. Everything about the building and the experience feels sleek and modern and beautiful. The images flashing through the screens, the clean lines and architecture, the colors, it makes you feel like you're seeing something new and almost space-like. At one moment I even felt like I was in Disneyland visiting Epcot Center! It was truly awe inspiring. Also, for those who may be uneasy about going up that many flights, the elevator ride is quick and painless. You barely even feel like you're moving and you're entertained the whole way up with images that flash on the sides of the elevator. The entire experience is fantastic, and well worth the $30 bucks (for adults). One thing I would recommend is getting there early so you can move around freely and get better views. I don't know how my experience would have changed had I been forced to enjoy it with a \"million\" other people at the same time!"

As you ascend up to the One World Observatory you enjoy a 360 degree timelapse of the city's progression over the past 100 years.

The managing group has done everything to make this tour - a journey, an experience, not just a quick view of the city. We so appreciated the tunnel video experience at the base of the building, and the elevator ride up was remarkable. The kids enjoyed the transformation of the city, and the build at the end. The views are of course magnificent. I highly recommend getting the iPad for the complete experience. We only purchased one and shared it, which was plenty. We spent 2 hours up there, I could have stayed longer. The space at the top lends itself to lingering and spending time. We had a snack the restaurant which looked amazing and we only peeked in, as we had other dinner plans.I rarely write a review like this but felt compelled to.

But we can get this view from other tall buildings in Manhattan or from an airplane,. We went for our 6yr old son, he was impressed to be so high up and to be able to see a few buildings that he was familiar with. The restaurant at the top is a nice way to extend the time there without wading through crowds. Yes overpriced, but the chicken wings were very tasty. We do get herded around the observatory part, and there are a few sales pitches, one for a tablet, and one for a picture which they take without even asking. The glass floor, looking down to the street was tacky, it didn't look real. For someone who enjoys architecture and history this may make a nice stop for a couple hours, otherwise I think there are cheaper options that are just as enjoyable."

There were no lines. We were able to go in within 5 minutes. We went to see the sun setting and to view the lights coming on all over the city. It was a beautiful view!! We paid $15 for the interactive ipad, but I would not recommend. Although it looked cool, I did not think it enhanced our visit and we didn't think it was worth the money. We had no issues with getting down in the elevators as others did. We loved our experience and had nothing negative to say. When we went to the Empire State Building a few years ago, it was over 1 1/2 hour wait in long lines and up small stairwells. We also had to wait to leave. It dampened our experience there. We did not have the same experience here. Others have stated they encountered long lines or complained it was cloudy which I would imagine would make the visit negative. Ours was great and I would highly recommend a visit to One World Observatory."

I was excited to see and experience this but left very disappointed. I think this *COULD* be great with some changes.- First off, we purchased tickets for 5:45pm. You would think that they would only allow a limited number of people per time slot and that there shouldn't be a long line since everyone reserves a time. We had to wait in line over an hour just to get to the elevators. - The elevator ride up is pretty cool with video screens that look like glass overlooking NYC as it changes from past to present. It's over quickly and you get ushered into a long room with a video screen. After waiting so long to get to the top I really didn't want to watch any digital content on any screens. I'm there for the view! They play some silly video with images of NY which I can see at ground level so that was pointless and boring. Then the screen lifts up to reveal windows and you get your first view (finally!). 3 seconds later the screen lowers and you get to go to the next area.- This next area isn't the Observatory. It's a cafe where you can eat/drink. You are sort of far from the glass windows so you can't really see that well out. You have to go down a flight of stairs and FINALLY get to the observatory.- The view is great from there but the center is filled with a gift shop which I thought was really tacky. I mean normally you get forced to walk through a gift shop on the way out of an attraction, not in the middle of it.- We walked around looking at the skyline from different vantage points until we came to what should be the best sight of all. Looking straight up Long Island. It would be great to get close to the glass and take in that sight from the best angle. Unfortunately, they put this stupid video screen display thing right there and you can't get up close to the windows right there!! Of all the places to put that stupid thing!! They should move that to the gift shop area and move the gift shop downstairs.- Finally after feeling bit cheated out of our money, we went to leave. There was a huge line to get on the elevators to go down. That took another 20 min. When we got up to the elevators, we noticed one wasn't working. The lady said that one is only for special events or something. - Finally to add insult to injury, when we got off the elevator to leave, there wasn't a single person on line to go up. Not 1. Anyone could have just walked in and hopped on an elevator with no wait. Did they only sell tickets with 1 times slot!??Obviously the view is pretty amazing and there's special significance to the Freedom Tower and the ground it stands on. If they could just make some changes to the logistics of getting up there and the layout of floors (like leave the freaking windows un-obstructed!!), it would be a fantastic experience."

They make you purchase the ticket for a specific time, so I figured it would move quickly. I went after peak time and the employee I asked said it would take \"about 10 minutes\" to get up the elevators. After standing in line for 30 minutes, I finally got in the elevator (which were really cool).Then they make you stand in another line for 5 minutes to force you to watch their video, which alright, but not worth it. Then they make you stand in another line for 5 minutes to take stupid pictures in front of a blue screen.By the time I got to the view, I was pissed, sick and tired of being there, and running late to make it to my later plans. I ended up missing a Broadway show. Then the line to get back down took an additional 20 minutes. Basically, I stood in lines for over 60 minutes, after waiting 3 hours to go at my designated time slot. Some of those lines were unnecessary. Had I known that it would take that long, I would have never gone, but the indication from employees is that it would take less time. Further, the view isn't NEARLY as good the Empire State Building or 30 Rock, which are both a lot easier to get to. That said, this is one of the coolest buildings I've ever seen. I recommend going to it, just don't pay the money and the time to go to the top. TOTALLY not worth it."

While the Observatory itself and the amazing views are well worth the trip, I recommend staying away from the restaurant. Although the waiter was friendly and helpful, the food was mediocre at best. Definitely highly overpriced... The pasta I ordered was cold and it was a rather small portion. Nothing to rave about. Somewhat a pity because it would have made for an excellent visit if it wasn't for the restaurant."

You won't feel crowded by other people, as there is ample room to walk around and take your time seeing everything. There is even a cafe where you can grab a bite to eat. If you're looking for any type of 9/11 mentions, you won't really find it here. You can see the original footprints of the twin towers and there is a memorial museum nearby. Other than that this is purely a way to see for miles from 102 stories up. PS Right now, there's a discount for Mastercard holders on Mondays."

We did late day to see the day views and watch the sun set. Passionate tour guides man stations around the view floor and share lots of cool and interesting facts about...well...everything, the city, the sites, the building, the recovery..While no one actually goes in to detail about those bastards that attacked the Trade Center, you can not and should not forget,why this new building is here in the first place., We stayed for about an hour and 15 min then headed up stairs to the restaurant. Pretty cool having dinner on the 115 th floor, watching the sunset, having a glass of wine and sharing history with your kids. From great tragedy comes great courage. One should always remember, especially international visitors, that this building is a big FU to the cowards that knocked down the old ones."

            "review": "Great views, but could be a better experience.. This is the observatory everyone has been waiting for, but did it live up to the hype?The observatory has its own entry on the West Street side of the building. Tickets can be purchased inside, or you can buy them in advance online. Entries are timed every 15 minutes, but you can stay as long as you want once inside. Tickets are $32 each.You initially take an escalator down to the main entrance where they'll scan your ticket and you will have to go through a security checkpoint similar to TSA at the airport, but you get to keep your shoes on. Just beyond security is a huge wall map with ever-changing stats on the amount of visitors and miles travelled to get there, as well as a live indicator of where those entering hail from. From there you walk through a corridor of stone acknowledging the bedrock of the building's foundation. There are some factoids projected on some of the rocks, but they only stay on for a little while, then fade away. That's fine if you're waiting in a long slow line, but not when it's moving quickly (as ours was). If you stop to wait for it to appear again you hold up the whole line.Next, you're directed into your elevator to take you to the observatory. Three of the elevator's walls are floor to ceiling monitors that show a digital depiction of the evolution of the neighboring area. This is well done, but the elevator ride is just too quick to truly appreciate it. Stepping off the elevator you are guided to a narrow but wide corridor where a brief welcome video is projected on the wall. At the end of it the wall lifts up in sections to reveal the view of the city below.Your next stop is going to be a sales pitch that you're stuck listening to. They have iPads you can rent for $15.00 that are calibrated with the view from wherever you're standing and you can learn more about items in that view by touching them on the screen. It's pretty clever and can be useful if you're not familiar with New York City.Now you finally get to go to the 360 degree observation deck view, but not without taking the obligatory picture-for-purchase first.The views are amazing, including several states, 8 bridges and almost all of Manhattan. It seemed a little hazy when we went, but \"...on a clear day you can see forever...\". It's a bit surreal when you think about just how high in the air you are.At the north and south sides there are rings of 'City Pulse' television monitors (that kind of resemble a stargate). Employees will periodically do presentations within these rings discussing some of what you're seeing. Somewhat interesting.One big negative when taking photos is that there is often a reflection and/or glare in the windows, so frame your shots accordingly.There's an elevated platform called a \"Skyportal\" where you stand on a glass floor over support beams with more television monitors underneath with a video of the traffic below. Unfortunately, it's just a video and isn't even remotely comparable to the Willis Tower Skydeck in Chicago.There's a restaurant and caf\u00e9 up one floor where you can grab a quick snack or a nice, sit-down meal. Expect to pay higher prices than normal because you're a captive audience with one of the best views in town.Of course, there's a gift shop with expectedly overpriced souvenirs you'll pass through before you can head back down so be prepared.The elevator ride down has more cool images on the walls, but the ride is just too quick.Having also been to the Empire State Building as well as Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center), I was a bit disappointed here. The other two have quite a bit of information about their construction and history, as well as outdoor observation decks, but this does not. I think most of that is reserved for the 9/11 memorial and museum (both must-dos). Also, if you have to choose between only one of the three, ask yourself what you want to see and experience. This is the most expensive of the three and, because you're standing in the Freedom Tower, you won't be able to get a picture of the Freedom Tower in the skyline."

The opening of the One World Observatory was much awaited, but now that it has opened, it leaves a bit to be desired. Obviously, being close to the southern tip of Manhattan, there are many sites that can be seen here much better than from either Empire State Building or the Top of the Rock; the entire New York Harbor can be seen splendidly, as can the Statue of Liberty, Ellis lsland, Staten lsland, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, South Brooklyn, and Jersey City, New Jersey. Lower Manhattan is seen in great detail. lt is on the 102nd floor, compared to the 86th floor for the main observation deck in ESB (where access to the 102nd floor can be gained for a separate, additional fee), and the 70th at TotR. But the view is seen through thick reflecting glass windows, which a bit hampers visibility, while the two others are outside. Moreover, admittance is according to a time slot given on payment of the entry ticket, like in the Top of the Rock, and this time slot can be even three hours from payment time; paying even a much higher entry fee on top of the already high fee - basically, a bribe - enables speeded-up entry. This stands in stark contrast to Empire State Building, where first come is first served; both times that this reviewer was there in the last few years - on beautiful days in August and in September, the height of the tourist season - he accessed the observatory within 40 minutes. After 85 years, ESB is still the best observation place in New York City; but the OWO is worth a visit at least once."

One World Observatory is now a must-see if you're going to New York according to the advertising blurb, but it's hard to disagree with that: its builders have taken the traditional viewing platform and brought it right into the 21st century with a clever use of technology.Worth saying we didn't pre-purchase tickets or spend a long time in line waiting for one - and this was 11am on a Saturday morning - so don't feel compelled to committing yourself to a day/time in advance then finding out the weather's rubbish and compromising your view, and tickets aren't transferable.People with vertigo/a fear of heights shouldn't be deterred from going up the building: you don't see the outside world during the astonisingly fast lift ride to the top (with a digitally-animated history of the New York skyline playing around the elevator's four walls instead). This was nothing compared to the attraction's pre-show, however, which I won't ruin - suffice to say, tech is used here to create a dramatic reveal that had several people in our group gasp in amazement.The observatory itself is a full 360-degree viewing platform, and very, very spacious - meaning you're never pressed up against the glass or without a decent vantage point. Not many people in our group spent the $15 on the tablets to pick out landmarks on the horizon; to be honest, the guides giving presentations at regular intervals on the viewing platform were happy to field any questions.Once you're done at the top, it's straight back down with another lift show; not quite as impressive as the ride up but different nonetheless.This is a great attraction, and a real boost to the New York tourist offering - while tickets are not cheap at $32 each, it's definitely worth a visit."

I won't spoil it, but right after the introductory movie, something cool happens! A circular observation deck offers views in every direction, especially good for the lower Manhattan sites. We rented the iPad ($15) and it names all of the major sites that you'll see, plus offers video of some of them. Pretty cool. Pick a time that you want to visit & purchase tickets ahead of time. Lines were long to get in (on a Sunday morning) & it's also more expensive."

You can see it all, 360 view from the 102nd floor. A view of NYC multiple Boroughs and New Jersey the Atlantic Ocean, Ny Harbor looks amazing with Lady Liberty and if you go a at sundown the View over NJ is breathtaking. This building is a modern Marvel and the story told and you begin your journey through the bedrock is educational and a testament to the resilience of NY'ers and Americans alike. The view of Downtown alone with make your visit worth while!. The Elevator Ride, amazing video history lesson, must see!"

Broke our hearts having been working for a company with business links to numerous companies in the Twin Towers. Returned to Manhattan in November 2015 and for a long overdue visit. Thoughts we should take in the World Trade Centre. What a visit, what an attraction and hats off to all those who have created such a marvel with enormous sympathy. The whole visit was a delight from start to finish. Take in the bar. Awesome service and views that take your breath away. Tip: pay a little more for the VIP ticket."

In my case all those marketing issues - show etc was unnecessary because I would more love those 10 minutes view of NY and NJ in sunlight.

The elevators travel at 23 miles an hour and the walls become a screen showing the history and height of buildings as your ears pop. Then you line up to enter a corridor with an amazing montage of New York and then the screens rise and you are just staring right over the city of New York. The viewing deck is 360 degrees and although they offer an interactive ipad rental for $15 you don't really need it. Just ask one of the helpful staff members. It isn't sentimental or poignant that is all in the Museum to 9/11 but why are the souvenirs so outrageously priced. It just isn't necessary and virtually nobody was leaving with having purchased from the store. So glad we did it even at the rather expensive $32 per adult. There is a beautiful looking restaurant but didn't investigate the prices but if you have the time there isn't a rush to enjoy the experience."

We booked in advance and were given a time slot but changed it without any fuss from the ticket office staff, when the weather wasn\u2019t looking good. There's still quite a bit under construction around the Trade Centre but One World Trade Center is complete and very impressive. A very fast elevator takes you to the top, where you can walk all the way around and get some fantastic views. Not as good as the other two tall buildings for photographs, as you have to take through the glass (there's no outdoor deck) and it's difficult to avoid reflections. There are staff who are doing talks and presentations you can watch/ listen to and you can stay up there in relative comfort for some time. What we liked though was going into the Bar/ Dining Room (you should book if you want to eat but it won't be cheap), ordering drinks and watching the sunset. Very civilized! Recommended."

We decided to follow others' advice about going near sunset which turned out to be a great choice. We reserved on line without any difficulty choosing 30 min before sunset. Compared to the other choices, it was reasonably priced. Anyway, we arrived on an overcast day approximately five minutes before our scheduled time. We quickly went through security and onto the elevator for a fast, neat ride to the top. The neatest thing about the observation deck particularly compared to the other viewing attractions is that it was spacious, relaxed...you didn't feel like lemmings packed in to the area. Other than not being able to see Central Park, the view was better than the others because there were fewer competing buildings and you can easily see the different neighborhoods and connections to the city. They also had guides who gave you interesting tidbits on NY. We did not rent the iPad's per the other recommendations of previous travelers. Might not be a bad idea if you had never been to NYC.It was particularly neat to see NYC before the daylight left and then to see it after the light was gone and the city lights emerged. We never felt rushed and there were plenty of places to comfortably sit. We were able to see NYC in two completely different worlds for only one price. Would definitely return and my highest recommendation for this attraction"

When we got to the Observatory the guides informed us we could switch our tickets for another day as the visibility was set at zero. We saw some people go up but we're very glad we waited. The museum at the start is very interesting and the way the view is presented to you at first is beautiful."

It was a clear day and the views were stunning and looking down 100+ floors down at the cars below was incredible! The observation deck covered every angle of the City and I would run out of superlatives to describe this attraction! Definitely worth a visit....I could've stayed there all day!!!"

You start out below ground, reading some history and watching vignettes of workers talking about the building then you walk through bedrock to get to more video and then the elevator. The elevator ride (look for it on YouTube) is worth the price of admission right there. You are brought up to the top where you can rent an iPad with an interactive map of what you are seeing out the windows. There is also access to an eatery up there. As they say, on a clear day you can see forever. It is a bit disappointing that you cannot go outside like you can on the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center, but don't let that deter you."

We decided to go ahead - the elevator ride in itself is a show - and its fast. because there is no view - you can rent an ipad for about 10.00 and it will show you what you are missing. There is a person who gives a description of nyc and it was interesting. I saw nothing but clouds- I will say that if you are scared of heights this may not be good for you. I was not great - but all i saw was clouds. So we went to the restaurant - If the view had been clear - it would have been magnificient. We went for experience.

I don't like way it has been turned into an attraction with a \"presentation\" to start with and the following up-sell of renting a tablet to tell you about the buildings for an additional $15. It is expensive as it is. Don't fall for it.The video in the elevator was a nice idea but too short. Even if you know about it and are prepared to watch it, it goes by pretty quickly. Would have loved to have it repeated in a \"dark room\" or something where you could stay as long as you like.Of course many photo opportunities of Manhattan Midtown and the surrounding Jersey City and Brooklyn. Not to bothersome that everything is behind glass windows. Interestingly, since One World Trade Center is a beautiful building from the outside, it might be better to go up one of the other towers like Empire or Rockefeller.The best thing of the whole experience was a guy called Fountaine that did a too short presentation overview of New York and what is happening as his job after actually being retired. Give that guy a 30 minutes show to tell you everything about New York and I'd gladly pay the full amount only for that!"

I was pleasantly surprised upon arriving at the observatory that it was quite clear. You can purchase a tablet to view the sites for $15 or just enjoy the view on your own. There's also a restaurant and gift shop in the observatory as well. Overall this was a great experience the only problem is with some of the windows there's a glare so you get your reflection in your pictures. However if you're just visiting, staying for a while, or a native New Yorker I highly recommend doing this at least once in your life."

Ever since the observatory opened this past year, I've wanted to take this trip to the top of New York (actually, the penthouse at 432 Park Avenue surpasses it, but this is a bit more affordable for most of us). First, you have to be on the far west side of the building to gain entrance, and nowhere could we find signage that indicated where to enter. It was a pleasant surprise to see that we could finally walk right around the Twin Towers memorial without needing tickets and reservations - as was required for the past few years since that opened. Our next pleasant surprise was finding that we were upgraded to \"priority\" admission with my MasterCard. On a Sunday afternoon, however, the lines were relatively short so the difference was minimal. When you board the elevator, don't forget to turn around and face the wall, which is a set of video screens on three sides that depict the progress of NYC in a countdown from its founding to the present day - as you take the trip to the top in less than a minute. There is a yearly countdown in the upper right hand corner. Once out of the elevator, you are herded in to a small room with a LARGE video presentation that shows NYC life for about two minutes. Then, the screen rises and you get your first view of the city before it comes down again. The next \"stop\" is a chance to have your party's photo taken (you can buy it or not later on back downstairs) against a green screen view of the city. If you want a memento of your trip, be my guest. There is a small refreshment are/bar on the upper level, but the main viewing point is a 360\u00b0 panorama a few steps below. It is breathtaking and sometimes a little disconcerting - particularly when you walk over a section that shows views directly down below. Otherwise, take your time at seeing all that's out there in the city and beyond. They do rent small iPad like devices that give you views and information of what you're looking at, but if you are at all familiar with New York, you should be able to pick out the familiar sights below, whether it's the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to the south or uptown to the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building and being able to see the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges right below you to the east. You could spend $32 in worse ways."

The elevator was a cool experience as the walls would show you a video on how the city and how the city's sky line has changed over the years. As you're getting closer to the top of the building you can feel your ears starting to pop as you go up to high! Once you get to the top, they take you into a room and show you a short video on some large screens. Once the video had ended, the screens lifted up and showed you your first view from the highest point in the western hemisphere. This was absolutely breathtaking. After you stood there with your mouth open for 2 minutes, they then took you into another room and from there you was able to walk around the tower to experience the Manhattan sky line in 360\u00b0.All the staff there were friendly and they has little kiosks telling you about what was going on in New York at the moment.This is a definite must see!"

Cafe available for tea, coffee and snacks - all good - plus a restaurant which look nice but we didn't go in. All good value for money."

Great views of the down town area and beyond, by far the best view and clearest of the three viewing opportunities in NYC. Plenty of information and informative talks on what you are viewing. The only criticism is that the entrance is no clearly signposted as you walk to it from the memorial, it's around the left hand side. The consierge at the main entrance must get fed up of pointing people in the right direction"

Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, lower Manhattan, Hudson river, New Jersey and even parts of Brooklyn can be admired from all sides of the observatory. And not forgetting the Midtown/ Times Square area which is also a fantastic view. This observatory is also bigger and able to accommodate more people at the top. Open space for photos or viewing should be easily available too. Be ready to be charmed by the introductory video which starts from the elevator. I am impressed by the videos.

The opening video they show you as you step out and then reveal the view is stunning. What I didnt like and why it got a four star rating is the fact that this attraction is not cheap and then they try and get you to hire an iPad for a silly amount of money so you can point out the sights as there is no signage or anything. I think this is penny pinching and unnecassarily, for the price you pay it should be included. The little show the guides do is interesting and informative, some good New York tips are given so it is worth a listen. The views from the top are amazing, they give you a different view than Rockefeller and the Empire State Building. It is worth a trip up."

We didn't book and got straight in, but it was a quiet time.If you had to pick one of the high buildings to go up however, this would not be my pick (I'd go Rockefeller)What annoyed my the most was that when you got to the top, you were stopped, for a compulsory 2 min video (one of those larger than life ones), and then when you got out of this, you got a 5 min \"sell\" on why you should hire an ipad to explain the buildings you can see (as they don't have any signage up). I thought this was rude, they should put up a few signs and pics. The elevator up showed a video of the building going up which was interested, but on the way down the whole elevator showed a video that spun around which made me feel ill. I ended up closing my eyes to stop watching it.So now I can tick this off my list, but I won't race back or necessarily send others."

Eat elsewhere, and buy your gifts elsewhere. If the Observatory wants to earn that revenue, then they should charge appropriately."

Unlike the Top of the Rock or Empire State Building, you're not able to go outside but the views are excellent and obviously, it's a much more modern building so the viewing decks have been designed with the public in mind. There's even a small bar up there, definitely worth a visit"

It is an additional fee of $15.00 to rent a tablet but we thought it was worth it because it zooms in on many New York attractions with information and history on each one, like with the Statue of Liberty. The elevators that take you up to the top floor,102, takes less that 2 minutes to get you there, and the walls become a movie, taking the passengers through a visual of the NYC sky line form the 16th century to today."

At the entrance they have the lines organized to be form if you have already bought your entrance or you haven't. Payment line advances at good speed. One Whatchout: if you bring kids, they don't pay but you do need to request a ticket for them to enter. Yet if you forget they have a counter downstairs that helps you to get without needing to go back to the main cashier. After paying, you form to get the security check and to get in line for entering into the elevator. One tip: have your camera ready to record inside the elevator, they have a very nice experience ready for you! (I won't spoil the surprise) Once up: the 360 views are just amazing! We had the opportunity to be at sunset time, and was great to see NYC from the top at this precise moment, we got very nice pictures, had a romantic moment and got the chance to see NYC at night too.Going down... also have your camera ready!"

The views are spectacular, and I have to say while I initially was rolling my eyes at the pre-observatory presentation, in the end I thought they actually did quite a good job setting the scene and preparing you for what you were about to see. Building up the experience is a great way to make it seem all that more spectacular. However, if I were to return I'd appreciate the option to bypass the little movie and iPad experience sales pitch and just go straight to the observatory.Once on the observatory level itself, I found the layout very good. Plenty of space for people to gape, take pictures, and move around. Also plenty of space for sitting along the windows, which was a relief for my mom. The elevator rides up and down were also thrilling, although if you get motion sickness you'll want to close your eyes.Biggest complaint: expensive. But hey: it's New York! Do this only after you've visited the 9/11 Memorial and Museum."

Walked right up to the ticket booth, paid $32, walked right into the elevator and up I went. 102 floors. When you get to the top, the first thing you will encounter is a pitch to rent a tablet device. The device recreates the New York skyline. You can tap a building, landmark, etc., on the device and you will learn more about what you are viewing out the window.The device is $15 to rent. This is your only chance to rent it. You will go back down two floors after you pass this rental station and won't have a chance to reconsider your decision. If you want to learn something, rent it. If you just want to look at the view, don't.I didn't rent one, and wished I did. If there was a second chance, I would have rented one. After just paying $32, $15 more was a bit off-putting. But, I think it will enhance your experience. It would have mine.Head down the escalator and say \"cheese\", because they are going to take your picture and try to sell it to you later when you leave. You find yourself standing in a line, and you're not sure why. It's because they are restricting the flow of people and requiring everyone alone, or in their group, to stand in front of a wall with the NY skyline, where they will take your picture. Then they will hand you a piece of paper with a barcode. The barcode will identify your picture for viewing and possible purchase later.So, if you think you might want to purchase a nice souvenir photo, while you are waiting in this line, make yourself picture ready. I was carrying a heavy winter coat, with hat hair. Do you think I bought the picture? No! Didn't even stop to look.If they informed me what was going to happen, gave me a chance to look in a mirror, set down my coat, perhaps things might have been different. Not only did they not prepare you for having your picture taken, they never said anything about what was happening. It was left to your deduction. You, however, have been informed."

What has been done with an area destroyed by one of the worst events in the history of the world is truly amazing. I visited as the Center opened at 9am and there weren't many people in line. Several people have talked about priority access but that must be for weekends and other crowed times. On a weekday in the morning, there don't appear to be too many people.Walk into the new One World Trade Center from the PATH transit crossing and you will see the newly designed entrance to the building. You can tell there has been a lot of thought put into the building design and attraction presentation. The ride up is wonderful and there's nothing really to spoil. You can see videos of the ride up on Youtube. However the only real way to experience it is live!There is a $30 cost to visit the Observatory and yes they will try to take your picture and sell you packages at the end. You can avoid that by simply avoiding the pictures and walking left instead of right as you're approaching the photographer.The views are truly amazing from what is deemed as the Tallest Building in the Western Hemisphere. I would like to visit at different times of the day as the sun rising from the East is not the best lighting for the view towards Central Park. Late afternoon would be the best for that.There is also a cafe and restaurant at the top that would make for a great place to sit, relax and enjoy a meal in the sky."

I had bought tickets on line (highly recommend) so we were able to bypass the ticket booth and go directly to the elevator. One walks through a tunnel of bedrock to show us what Manhattan is made of then onto the elevator. It travels to the 102 floors in under 60 seconds and on your way up there is a video depicting how NYC was built up from the 1800's to today - very well done. Once uptop (feeling a tad woozy) they usher you in with a surprise that I will not spoil. After trying to push photos and ipads on us (no need, they have people upstairs who will answer all your questions) we went to the observation floor - WOW. Incredible views all around. I could have stayed up there for hours. Even for a jaded NY I would highly recommend. And the teenagers loved it as well!!! It is truly awe inspiring.

There is a sales pitch to convince you rent an ipad which will help you figure out what you are seeing. It would be cool if you want to spend the money, but I declined. The cafe and gift shops are way overpriced, but that's to be expected. We spent almost an hour at the top taking pictures and just soaking it all in. They have guides at a couple of spots talking about the city. It reminded me how much I really do love New York. When you consider the tragedy that led to the construction of this magnificent building, the only adjective that seems truly fitting to describe it is triumphant.One tip, take advantage of their MasterCard Monday deal and save 20% on admission."

On a cold and rainy day in New York we had to pick an indoor activity and we hopped on over here for a nosey (just after we collected our marriage license at the City Clerks Office nearby, weeee!) and we weren't disappointed. Going into the tower was a bit daunting initially and I wasn't too into the idea of going all the way up to the Observation Deck but curiosity took over eventually. We got talking to the doormen at the entrance by the ticket booth and they were so friendly, a nice welcome to the tower for sure. Infact, all of the staff were lovely, very warm and welcoming - they also seemed to emit a huge pride in New York City. We loved the \"big reveal\" at the end of the digital image show which was absolutely hilarious when the screen went up to reveal...a cloudy white mass of nothingness! The staff were like \"there's usually a view....*awkward silence*\" and it was so funny!Regardless of the clouds ruining our view (literally, our photographs are of windows looking out onto a blank white wall) the information within the observation deck is fascinating and we really enjoyed hanging around up there waiting for the clouds to pass, which they eventually did. While we were waiting we had a coffee in the caf\u00e9 - one of the nicest coffee's I've EVER had, but there being no seats at the tables was disappointing, especially as someone who spent half her time in New York hunting for a place to rest my poor feet!The elevator up to the deck itself is so amazing - felt very Doctor Who at one point (which probably wasn't the intention) but worth the entrance fee alone. All in all, a great visit and a cool way to spend a couple hours on a rainy day."

The view itself from the observatory was amazing. It had an effect to it that I hadn't experienced before in other observatories I've visited in NYC and other larger cities. The downside to our visit to the observatory was that it was a mostly cloudy day which kept you from seeing as far into the distance.

The observatory is amazingly well done, from the one-minute elevator ride to the movie you watch before going to the observatory. The views were outstanding. It was very crowded when we went (on a Saturday morning) so you had to fight to get access to the windows. You could see clearly in every direction. I would definitely recommend One World Observatory to all visitors to NYC; definitely worth the $32.Tip: Be sure to use the bathroom before getting in line. It took about 30 minutes to wait in line, go through security, go up the elevator, and view the (mandatory) pre-observatory movie before you could easily get to a bathroom. Across the street in Brookfield Place there are public-accessible restrooms. It's also a good warm place to wait for your time to go up."

A very good thing was that there was a film during the elevator ride, so you did not feel the extreme speed going up and down"

The negatives - no signage in the observatory to help you identify what you are looking at. If you want that info, you need to rent an ipad for $15 (on top of the $30+ you spent to get there). Most disappointing to me is that you will never know why that building was built where it is, and why it is an important symbol of American perseverance. This building is in sacred space but there is no mention at all of 911 or the redevelopment of the land thereafter. The view and food saved my rating from being one star. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for leaving this piece of the story out of the observatory."

So when I was invited to a private function (one that I would not miss for anything) at One World Observatory I thought \"how am I going to do this\"? I can tell you the way it is designed - from the elevator up to the wide corridors - I felt very comfortable being up there. I cant speak of the lines or crowds as it is not something I had to deal with but I can tell you that the views are spectacular and the staff from security downstairs, to elevator operators and folks upstairs were friendly."

I decided to purchase 3 tickets as a surprise to start off a wonderful Birthday celebration on Saturday January 16th.Upon arriving we walked right through security as there were few visitors that evening. We were very impressed with the entrance and staging area. The elevator ride was superbly combined with video graphics and a very quickly reached the 102nd floor. The short video presentation worked well and then the view was outstanding.Once we walked the entire deck we decided to complement the evening with a few drinks at the bar. Having been a patron of The Greatest Bar on Earth we were disappointed with the design. Once our drinks arrived I asked to look at the menu so we could order a few small plates to share. Unfortunately it was quite limited and consisted of pub style appetizers, which do not blend with a nice glass of wine.I would strongly recommend that the concession manager and team rethink and expand the choices on the menu as this was quite disappointing and diminished the end of our visit."

Every aspect of the Observatory was cool, from the bedrock lined entrance to the amazing 'preshow'. Plenty of room to move around and plenty of vistas. I agree with Tracy - the Apple device was a waste of money (15.00). We had lunch while we were there. It was expensive, but then you're paying for the view. All the tables had open views. Appeitzers ran about $15.00, entrees averaged $25-30. The food was good and I'm glad we stayed so we could relax and spend time taking in the views, but for the three of us the bill was $162.00 - gratuity was added."

There's the usual airport-style security to get through, but after that it's a leisurely stroll to the amazing elevator ride - there was just the two of us in the elevator so had a great view of the high-definition video screens that show New York being built around you as you ascend to the top (less than a minute). Be warned - this experience could be a bit scary for those with a fear of heights! As will the ride back down, which appears to propel you out the side of the tower in to a helicopter-style ride to the ground - have a look on YouTube for videos.Once up top there is a brief video introduction before the screens lift to show the immense view. There is a vast viewing area, with souvenir shopping and dining available. The floor to ceiling windows give an amazing view all around. Personally I preferred the view from the Empire State Building, and the open-air deck there. It's fully enclosed at One World Trade Center, which makes photos a bit more difficult."

We eventually started to wander away - though what they were saying was interesting and worthwhile - I wish I had known to pace myself. It also meant that there was no one on the floor to answer any questions as both docents were talking on opposite sides of the floor. I think they should stagger them and have a roving person to answer questions that you don't want to interrupt the speaker who has his routine with. The elevator ride up was special - with the history or a changing city.

            "review": "One World Trade Center. Another eye in the sky observatory in NYC. This one has a bit of a twist though.The place is very good. It is a completely different experience from the Empire State Building or the Rockefeller and that alone makes it worth a visit.It costs $32 for and adult ticket and you deifnitely must do it.The journey up in the lift is exciting as you see NYC being built up aorund you. You then get to see another short video before the amazing views are unveiled before your eyes.The only reason I have not given this 5/5 is that I like the idea of being outside on the observatory. As you are kept inside any photos you take will be through glass which obviously can lead to unwanted reflections. As well as this when we went up it was freezing cold outside as it was winter, the sun was still shining though and as you are so high up in a glass covered building it was effectively a big greenhouse. I can only imagine how uncomfortabley hot it gets here in summer.However all of that being said if you visit NYC you should definitely go up here - just personally I prefer the rockefeller and the empire state.A little mention - they do try and sell certain tickets that will allow you to catch the sunrise/sunset. What we have found to be useful is if you have a look in advance when the sun will rise/set on the day you are planning to go and then book a ticket for a little bit before this you can then stay long enough to see daylight, sunset and a bit of the evening as well all from one visit.Also like anywhere else try to book your tickets online before you get there."

The views were even better with all the lights on and you could see way out over New York & New Jersey. See how small the Statue of Liberty is from the Observatory.

I had a 16 hour layover in Newark on my way home from living out of the country for two years, so I hit the town to visit and this was my first stop. I was really excited when I came in and they had stories of the people who were on the building team, then the elevator ride up was fun with the video too. When I got to the observation deck I was then disappointed. I had just visited the Petronas Towers the week before and at the top there was tons of information about the building, a replica and more. This is strictly to remember and the views which the views, even at night did not disappoint. The actual building is pretty amazing too and it's worth seeing for sure. It's definitely a must visit because of the meaning but it's good to have some expectations."

I had to print them off which was slightly inconvenient (although I was lucky enough to be staying with a friend who had a printer!). I'd recommend e-tickets or being able to pick tickets up, rather than having to print them off. We arrived at our allocated time and went straight up in the most amazing lift/elevator I have ever been in! The speed is incredible - our ears popped! The view once upstairs is absolutely breathtaking and the 'reveal' is jaw-dropping. I am uncomfortable with heights but luckily the space around the windows is very deep so I was able to gradually move away from the wall towards the windows! We rented the iPad but at $15, I'm not sure it was really worth it as the view is so amazing and a lot of the sights are probably quite well-known already. I was with my 6 year old nephew and he loved the view (and the iPad coincidentally so it might be a good child entertainment option if you want to spend longer admiring the view than they have patience for!). It was expensive but it was completely and utterly worth it - you literally feel on top of the world!"

Recalibrate its GPS at the compass points in the observatory floor. It is VERY helpful in orienting your views and telling you what you're looking at.

It was a clear day so we had an amazing view. Quite well done, ipad for $15 extra but this is not essential, there is someone at the top to answer any questions and she gives a good slide show. You can spend as long as you want looking around at the top. I would recommend going early we booked for 9.30 and it wasnt over crowded but did get busier as we left."

It got a bit dizzying and annoying to look at after a while though, so we just asked the view. If you can nab one of the guides/speakers on the observation deck, you're better off. They are very knowledgable and it's free. Ben explained everything to us that we asked about in detail!"

On our last day in New York (6th January) we decided to visit OWO, we had already been to the 9/11 Memorial, Museum and Tribute Center in the week.We got to OWO at 9am just as it opened, there wasn't a queue at all, walked straight in pay for our tickets $32, then go downstairs to security.There's a walkway through of old rock and granite to the lift.The lift is amazing, has animated footage of starting from one year to the present of New York changing over the years from nothing but a field to what it is today.Once upstairs on the 102nd Floor you go through to another room where you watch a video and they the screens lift up and you get to see New York from the 102nd Floor for the first time, Breathtaking!You'll then make your way down to the 100th floor where the Observatory is actually on, the lady will offer you an iPad to take which you can point at certains places and will tell you information about that part of the city.There is also a resturant there aswell, where you can get a cake or coffee.A 360 enclosed room with views of the whole of New York City, Statue of Liberty, Emprire State Building and plenty more.Personally i think its the best Observatory Tower in New York itself and it is a fitting replacement to the Twin Towers.The Lift down is just as good as the lift up, The Gift Shop is abit pricey on certain items, but you're only there once.Highly Recommended"

The lift to the top starts your tour with a modern day electronic trip through time. Step out of the lift & the trip continues until all is revealed. I won't say more on this as for some that will be the best part. Take your time moving around the observation deck & if you are new to the city, you can access skyline information through GPS IPad information available at a small cost.You can buy tickets each day by lining up but this can take a while. You will then need to come back at your allocated time. Buying express VIP tickets can move you up the queue & make access easier but in each case I would suggest buying before you go. You only need to be there 15 minutes before your scheduled time so this could mean you have more time to visit the surrounding memorials & less time, potentially, spent standing in the cold.Overall a great addition to things to do in New York"

I would have given it one more star EXCEPT that Top of the Rock observation deck is 100% more interesting and has better views of New York City.Best way I can describe one World Observation is anti-septic...totally indoors, some views are purposely blocked so you follow their logic as to how you see things.Other than your ears popping in the elevator, there is really no real experience of being 100 stories high...it could all be TV screens and you never would know the difference. They corral you at the start of your visit with a camera, and at the end try to sell you the pic, and again, purely antiseptic, the picture shows nothing of your visit, it is a fake background.I suspect the vast majority of reviewers here have never been to Top of the Rock. It is three levels, glass walls with gaps for camera lenses, and you are outdoors some 85 stories high...a vastly better experience."

Growing up in New York I may be a little bias but I would have hoped that the designers of this building would have considered some of the nuances of the original World Trade Center. Exterior wise this building is beautiful and well done but the interior styling is lacking. My wife and I loved to watch the sunset from the top of New York. We decided to go to the One World Observatory while we were in New York for the US Open. Our journey began with waiting on line for the elevator, than we waited on line to view a short movie, than we waited on line to be sold an iPad viewer, than we waited on line to reach the actual observatory and than we waited on line to eat a snack. If you enjoy waiting on lines this place is for you. The elevator experience was very well done and neat to see however the observatory level was very disappointing. The windows are angled in such a way that you really have a tough time taking pictures. The building owners obstructed the best view such as looking north at 5th avenue. They decided to put a desk directly in front of this window to sell photos and other items to the tourists. Another disappointment was the lack of any seating at this level. My wife who recently had a knee replacement had nowhere to sit just for a minute while enjoying the view. All in all I would recommend saving your money to see another venue or museum."

It all felt like a money making scheme with the amount of gift shop tat and restaurant. When we were in the observatory, it was hard to actually look at the view as so many people were sat on the window ledges because there wasn't anywhere else to sit. We left the attraction after being inside for about 20 minutes - I'd recommend Rockafella over this in a heartbeat which is SO MUCH BETTER.

I say and looked out towards the Statue of Liberty (where we had also been that day) and she looked so small but looking past her out towards the mouth of the river watching ferries and a cruise liner was wonderful. You can get a meal in the restaurant but I believe you need to book for that and even if that's all you want to do you still have to pay the $30 something dollars each just to get up to it. However you can also get a tea/coffee and cake if it's something smaller you require. The staff are friendly and helpful and it is well worth the money and a fitting tribute to NY City!"

So we just went for it and the whole queue system was so unorganised it was quite stressful! When we got up there, the view was literally 'zero visability', all we could see was cloud but we had been warned! We decided to get something to eat and wait for the cloud to lift as you can spend as long as you like there. There is a cafe area and the food was nice, however slightly overpriced seen as there weren't even any seats to eat it at! There were tables but no chairs, it was bizarre! If you go down a level, there are benches to sit on so we took our food down!  Later on, the cloud lifted and we could see quite a bit.

You then have free access around the observatory to view from all sides, (finding a space at a window is a waiting game), but the views are awesome watching New York change from day to night, This is the place to go for a great uninterupted view of New York, forget going up Empire State and Top of the rock as this observatory puts them to shame"

Buy your ticket in advance online and plan enough time - although you are usually getting a ticket for a specific time you still have to wait up to 1 hour to get in...i.e. we purchased tickets for 3:30 and entered the building at 4:30. If you can afford get a prority pass to skip the lines. Unlike Empire State Building the observatory is not outside but inside, meaning that you will have glass (and eventually reflection) between you and the sights."

When you get off the elevator you go through a brief presentation followed by a \"surprise.\" Nope... not going to give it away, but it's worth it.Once you get to the observatory deck, take the time to appreciate the 365 degree views.My recommendation... pay a little extra for the interactive iPad they offer you at the top of the tower. One per family is more than fine... but you learn a lot and the experience becomes more than just a nice view.I'll admit... you do get a lump in your throat when you hear the stories of the building, the energy that went into it... combined with breathtaking views."

This is the tallest building in the Western hemisphere, so you have to do it really. The views are just astonishing. You should combine this with trips up the Empire State Building and the Rockefeller Centre, in fact Rockefeller was in some ways better because you get to see Central Park too.

Don't wait in lines - you have better thing to do in life - Spring for the Express / Timed Entry tickets - you wont be disappointed. OWO - has taken cue from Disney and made the ride to the top an amassment - the elevators have floor to ceiling LCD screen that provide informative and interesting information on the way up and down. When you reach the elevator level - you are ushered in to an observation area with blinds over the windows - and after a short speech - the big revile of Manhattan which last less than a minute. Which is a bad thing - because this the last good view you will have of Manhattan at night because on the actual observation level two floor below - the gift shop lights glare off the windows clouding and obscuring the view. So between the gift shop lights and the forehead and finger smudges you can view the lights of New York City. In all honesty the Empire State Building View is better - simply because it's outdoor, with no glass, no reflections. And it's in the center of NYC with the city around it.What is breath taking about the OWO is looking down into the memorial fountains of the original WTC building footprints - you can almost feel them still there.Don't miss it - Don't miss the 9/11 museum below.

It would be best if you could go on multiple times and look at the different walls each time to see all angles of the city. I would definitely try to do that next time. The visibility was, in fact, zero when we got to the observation desk. Pure white. You couldn't see a thing. Again, it was expected.

I also really liked the video as you wait for the elevator. Workers who rebuilt the Trade Center are featured and it's very nice to see their passion and their hard work. I would like to see occupancy rates of the new tower...seems pretty vacant. We ordered tix in advance and we were glad we did. We stood in the cold for under 5 minutes. Others were in long lines outside. I would try to go as early in the day as possible. We went at 1430 and it was mobbed. My 12 year old LOVED the whole experience."

They ask to print the tickets, why don't promove the electronic tickets also the wallet options?They ask to be at least 15 minute before to your scheduled time but did not have a waiting area in side the building to wait. You must wait outside the building with the winter weather.They was behind the schedule but not all security-scaning line were open.They promove the builiding is based in a real rock but the area is covered with fake stones.Long lines to wait for the Elevators but they was sent empty.In the lobby of the elevators they don't prepare waiting areas acording the capacity of each elevators. They wait the elevator is in the floor to start to count how many people fit in it, and an employee need to ask to remove the backpacks and fold the strolers, why they don't use videos in monitors with this information and also announced to prepare your camera?Do you pay extra for a fast line to go up but this doesn't work to going down !!!!!!Definetly they need to improve their system if they sold the ticket by an appointment, why they are behind the schedule if they know exactly how many tickets are sold?Bad organization, good view. They must improve.Tips: buy your tickets through the website, the line for the box office is very long.Have you camera ready in the elevator and at the arrival in the 102 floor, nice things happen in both areas."

We had timed tickets on the 2nd Jan 2016 for 5:45pm and arrived 15mins ahead of schedule as requested. Firstly there were people everywhere with absolutely no order to the mass, there were two members of staff controlling crowds of two to three hundred. We were finally ushered into queue lines at 5:45pm. We did not enter the building until 6:40pm. So had stood outside in the freezing cold unable to use the bathroom or buy water for one hour and ten minutes with zero apology from the staff. It was so cold I almost gave up waiting.By the time we entered we had sore backs and feet and were numb. We then faced another 15mins queue for security and another 15mins queue through an interactive walkway for the lifts. So after being told to arrive at 5:30pm for our 5:45pm slot we finally reached the lift at 7:10pm, which to be honest is outrageous.Do not bring children or the elderly to this event. There were far too many people with tickets per time slot and the queue could not be processed efficiently as a result. There is no shelter from the cold, the sunshine or the rain. The view was amazing but it's New York, you knew it would be but the viewing platform was crowded with people pushing and shoving to even get close to a window so it was hard to appreciate everything anyway. Unless you can go at a really quiet time I would definitely give this attraction a miss, it was chaos and if there was anyway to complain to them directly I would."

Another building to look out at New York...nothing new...but it was so much more. The whole experience was incredible. Firstly, we heard that on the same day, people were waiting 4 hours to get into ESB (oh my gosh!) and 8 hours on NYD. We booked tickets online the day before and we had little to no waiting. We were in and out within an hour and didn't feel rushed at all.It is a quieter time of year so I can imagine this gets busier but for us it was perfect. I would advise checking the weather beforehand as no point doing in a cloudy day. You have 360 views of the boroughs and you can pay $15 for an iPad that pin points specific buildings and provides more info. We didn't do this but they looked good.As others have said, the elevator is brilliant. I won't say too much as I don't want to spoil it but I hate heights and suffer with anxiety when going in lifts and initially getting to the top of tall buildings, but I didn't really have a chance to think about it!I would definitely recommend this for a wider NYC view and Rockefeller for a closer view of manhattan. Don't bother wasting time with ESB. You see nothing different and you will waste half a day waiting to get in."

The elevator ride up and short show at the top were excellent multimedia presentations about the history of the New York skyline and the new Freedom Tower. The only caution I have is that several members of my family mentioned that they had momentary vertigo because of the speed of the elevator ascent. Otherwise, it was a great vantage point to see New York. Incidentally, I thought that the Top of the Rock was a better vantage point to see midtown landmarks. If you like to experience the open air, you may want to visit the Top of the Rock or Empire State Building. The One World Observatory is indoors and glare on the Windows may be a problem for picture taking especially if visiting at night. People are more likely to sit or rest at the Windows as they have an elevated vent at the window. It detracted from taking pictures as I had to work around those taking a break or standing on the vent to get a selfie. "

Well worth it. You are certainly not rushed to leave, and the elevator ride down is entertaining too. The staff were friendly, but there is room for improvement there.I personally would not use the ipad, maybe it's a good tool, but I find the folks that used them were always in the way, stopping short, and standing if front of a window with their head down blocking the view for everyone else.Well worth the visit, but try to go mid-week to avoid crowds."

You enter a walkway with various video projections of individuals sharing their stories of the tragedy and of the new building and its construction. You then enter a room where you watch a short video. I will not spoil the ending. The views are amazing and take your breath away. At an additional cost of $15 you can have an interactive audio tour on an IPad. Expensive but it does help you to identify the buildings and give you some historical context. Staff are helpful and friendly and offer interactive talks at various points around the viewing deck."

They are the best views from anywhere in Manhattan and they are well worth it, if you: - Come early on a clear day. Coming early (before 10 am) means much less waiting in line, and there will not be a crowd of people blocking your view from the windows. And a clear day is a must: there is not much of a view otherwise and this place is not worth the cost if there is no view.  - Bring a soft lens cleaning cloth to clean the windows when you want to take a picture. There is no outside location so pictures can only be taken through the windows. To avoid reflections, clean the section of window through which you want to take a picture, put your camera lens against the window and then take a picture. If an outside observation deck is what you want, go to ' top of the rock' at Rockefeller Center. - Buy tickets on-line, preferably using a discount coupon - Do not mind the in-your-face sales pitches for souvenirs or ' One World Explorer' device. Frankly, at USD 32 ticket price levels these devices should be included in the fee."

By the time my kids and I got inside, we were tired, cold, and completely not in a frame of mind to enjoy the experience. There was only very cursory educational/background provided - we would have been much more interested in the overall history of the area than in just the building of the tower. The short video was not even meant to be educational or informational. The walk-in voices installation could not be digested it as you moved through so fast. The elevator time-lapse was the most interesting part - but it went by FAR too fast to appreciate or even see it, plus it was blocked by the crowded elevator. I hoped we would see it on the way down again, but no. Upstairs was an expensive cafe ($8 for a croissant?) and views that are almost too distant to be of interest. Go to the Empire State Building instead to really appreciate the city."

They need not be so greedy for ticket sales and allow people to get a enjoyable and less crowded experience. The view up the top isn't bad.

This was a good choice on a cold, windy and crowded day as we entered with \"priority expedited entry\". We were able to experience the views before and after sunset. The first thing you think of are the many victims of 9/11 that once stood very close to where you are now standing. Sobering to say the least. As you look out and down from the east side of the tower, you can see the north and south memorial pools.."

You can spend a lot of time up there...just taking it all in. I give it 4/5 (not 5/5) just because you can a better view of the Manhattan skyline at Top of the Rock. If you have to choose between the two because of time or finances, I recommend Top of the Rock. But if you can go to both....it is worth it."

The guy that manged these lines, would only let two of them move until they were totally empty, while people in the third line were waiting in the cold for more than 20 minutes. The staff and managers are extremely rude and unable to organize the place. Totally unacceptable for the high price of the tickets. Another NYC tourist trap.

            "review": "Nice View with Heavy-Handed Sale Pitches. I bought tickets online, adding the slight premium for Priority access because on New Years Eve, I assumed it could get busy. Yes, the tickets are not inexpensive but it is a unique experience and I will tell you that the priority access is worth the extra.I understand that the observation deck is still relatively new and they are probably working out some kinks. Be prepared to be confused at the entrance. The signage is poor and you will be stuck scratching your head - especially if you pre-purchased priority access tickets. Just ask the employees that you see; they are helpful and should guide you. Again, inside the lower level queuing area, there is a lack of signage so you may find it confusing where to go if you have premium tickets. I saw so many confused people both outside and inside, not sure where they were supposed to go.In an effort to keep people flowing, they fill each elevator to the max. While this is generally acceptable and not too uncomfortable, it ruins the theatrics of the elevator ride. There are high-res LED screens on the walls to give you an animated experience as you ride up and down - but when packed full, it's hard to really experience it optimally. It's a short ride though, so I took it in stride. It's not the way the designers envisioned people would experience the video presentation, but it's what it is.Generally, the theatrics of the experience is well designed, from the initial trek to the elevators and ride up, to the initial reveal of the view. After that reveal, be prepared for the worst part of the experience... the heavy-handed sale pitches.The initial \"tease\" reveal gives you about 1 minute to take in the magnificent views, before they hide it and usher you into a second room. All guests are forced into a room at the top where all views are blocked - so your attention is on the sales people. You cannot leave the room until their sales pitch is over. In this room, they try to get you to spend another $15 for an iPad rental with unique app. Yes, the app looks to be well designed and useful for those that don't know the city or want to really dig into what they are seeing, but not everyone wants it. Honestly, they SHOULD be trying to sell this in the queue lines downstairs or at a kiosk on the observation deck level - NOT by forcing it down your throat as they do now.It's not over folks, the next sales pitch is around the corner. After their first sales pitch is over, they allow you to travel down one floor and funnel you single file in front of a huge LED screen where photographers try to snap shots of you and your group (to sell you later downstairs). After you get past this second gate of sales hell, you can then pick up some overpriced food at the dining area or head down one more level to the main observation level. The main observation deck is well done. It is open and easy to navigate around. Be prepared to wait your turn at most of the windows because there are a lot of people - but hey, that's expected for something like this. They also have two presentation areas where very knowledgable and friendly speakers will give you cool and informational introductions to a variety of topics (Brooklyn Bridge, 9/11 plaza, etc). I believe the topics rotate every 30 minutes or so. Generally, the experience is positive and the attraction has been designed well. The only frustrating parts are the lack of signage/way-finding at the bottom and the heavy-handed forced sales pitches at the top."

Unfortunately, the advent of the \"selfie\" now means that people are in place for an inordinate amount of time, trying to get the perfect shot. If they are not happy with the photo that they have taken, they regroup and try again. This can happen several times which means that the line to access a window can be five or six people deep. Having said this, when you can get to the windows, the views are absolutely stunning, even on a slightly overcast day, and it is fun trying to pick out various neighborhoods and landmarks.Definitely a worthwhile visit."

It's the perfect place to start for new visitors to orientate themselves in NYC. In addition to the 360 uninterrupted views of New York City, there's plenty of attractions on across the 2 levels of viewing decks. A few important tips. 1. Make sure you book in advance and select your preferred time to visit to minimise queuing on the day. 2. Visit during late afternoon (i.e. 3pm) so you can enjoy both day and nigh time view of the city. Get a spot in the observatory restaurant and grab a coffee/tea/snack and watch the sunset."

The views at the top are fantastic with 360 degree views of NYC.

We had tickets for the 4:30 entry into the observatory because we wanted to see all of NYC while it was light outside/sunset time. We arrived 15 minutes early as indicated on the ticket. When we got there, flustered staff who had no idea what was going on told us we couldn't get in line because the line was only for 4 o'clock tickets. At this point it was already 4:15. Us, and hundreds of other visitors were stuck outside in the freezing cold waiting to be told where to go for over an hour before we were escorted into the proper line. It was now 5:30, and we were just now getting in LINE! The entire time we had been waiting out in freezing cold conditions with wind off the hudson that we didn't dress for cause the tickets said 4:30! Once we got inside and past the other lines, and up to the top of the elevator, you wait some more. Theres a cheesy movie they make you watch. Then after the movie, you are escorted to a sales pitch where they try to sell you an iPad. Skipping that, you finally get to the observatory where it's full of hundreds of people blocking the windows. Of course by this time it was night, and we didn't get the experience we had paid for! As we went to exit, there was a 30 MINUTE LINE TO EXIT. Total in waiting we probably waited 2 hours for this unbelievably underwhelming experience. I complained to customer service on the way out and we were given a refund no questions asked. The management at One World needs to step things up if they want to provide an experience that is actually enjoyable and worth the $32 entrance fee."

The views are impressive. They advertise what seems to be a glass platform to look down to ground level but that's a con as it is basically TV screens over a fake glass floor that give the impression of you standing on a glass 100 stories up. Very poor i.m.o.Most annoying is that they have placed presentation booths in the two best viewing spots where inane presenters try to be funny. This dumbs down the whole experience. Another 10 min queue for the ride down.

It may be higher than the Empire State but it lacks the pizzaz - none the less it gives a different view of the city taking in all of Manhattan when you face north as well as good views over Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey. The cafe was fine and quiet - a good spot to get away from the crowds on the viewing floor. Probably the highlight was the elevator ride on the way up with a brilliant animation of New York from foundation to the present passing the two minute trip spectacularly. We queued for a total of twenty minutes to half an hour in the middle of the day, so I don't know if it's important to book ahead."

I purchased the limited edition collector's online when I purchased the tickets. However, when I went to collect them the sales person told me they were out of stock and had 2016 pins ready to go out and the pins on the rack were not the same limited edition pins. After some internal confusion and not finding any 2015 pins in the pack room, I was instead provided two $9.95 pins off the rack, instead of the two $12 limited edition pins I ordered.Also, the 3-coin collector's set I purchased had evidence of prior handling that I discovered after returning home.

The elevator is a nice and smooth ride with a nice mini movie while you are going up."

And this is disappointing. As a New Yorker, I expected a more respectful tone from the Observatory. For 180 degrees, you're staring straight down into the memorial pools -- a beautiful, solemn view. One that certainly should be enjoyed without two booming employees projecting pointless facts & selling the city like hotcakes into loudspeakers. Let the view speak for itself. They shuffle you from a beautiful introductory room with an incredible reveal (one that provides a chill and teary eyes for those who truly love the city) to another where they gather you 'round to rip you off for futuristic iPad panoramic technology. The idea is inventive and helpful for those new to the big apple. But couldn't it just come as a free app for your iPhone rather than ransacking excited tourists' wallets for $15 a pop? Because your $32 ticket x the size of your party just wasn't enough. This is startling especially as the first thing you see after passing through the metal detectors is a digital screen projecting the volume of tourists since its opening this 2015. Some 850,000+ on December 26. You do the math.It's not just the pointless priority ticket option (if you can spare 10 minutes, save yourself $20 and go with the general pass), gift shop that takes up too much space on the 100th floor and overpriced iPads, there is even an obnoxious sell for a professional photo op. They're willing to try to get you to buy anything. You've been herded here and there, and with tight security procedures (expected & understood), you're brainwashed to follow any employee in a blue shirt because you just want to see that damn view already.Yes, the view is other worldly. The facility is gorgeous, sleek and innovative. The design is a spectacle. And I still can't stop thinking about the big reveal. They nail it on the head in terms of showcasing the view. But all the constant, pushy \"buy this, buy that\" is seriously disheartening. This place should be a celebration of the beautiful city and a reminder of the important, historical soil we're standing on. Not an obnoxious auction with the \"ultimate experience\" going to the highest bidder."

Basically, we paid $65 per person to ride an elevator up 102 stories. We arrive on the 102th floor and they want us to see a presentation. It wasn't a presentation- they were trying to sell iPad tours. The view was great, but not worth $65. You received nothing else for the money. Then paid $16 for a pretzel, a small bottled water and a root beer. Wish we had skipped this site."

You move through this hallway of video screens telling the story and history of the tower, which is very interesting and compelling. The next step is the elevator to the 101st floor (50 seconds to the top). More videos about the city life in NYC, then the screens are lifted and opened to this amazing view overlooking the Big Apple. The whole floor was dedicated as an observatory area. iPads are rented for $15 to give more info on highlight aspects of the city...I rented it, but only used it a few time...may be worth it to do once. There is also a restaurant if you are hungry. I highly recommend this experience for anyone visiting New York City."

            "review": "Make One World Observatory your first choice. When visiting NYC, you have three main choices on buildings to go up in: One World Trade Center, Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building. Based on our experience on while on vacation in December, One World was the best and we visited all three observatories. Top of the Rock is very good and a close second to One World and Empire was a distant third. We originally had tickets to One World Observatory (OWO) on Christmas morning. Thanks to some unseasonably warm weather, the trade center was completely fogged in and had zero visibility. OWO gave us the option of going up or exchanging our tickets for another time and/or day. Classy move. We decided to try again the next day at 10AM and it was clear as a bell. Based on our experience on a Saturday, we got there about 9:45 and breezed right in with no wait. When we left closer to noon, there was quite a line. Your tickets are timed, so I don't know how bad the wait is, but I am assured it was longer than ours. Everything about OWO is well planned, starting with a high tech elevator ride and a video presentation at the top that when it is over opens into an jaw dropping view. From their you go up to the observatory and can spend as long as you want to looking at the city views. You can rent an iPad that is programmed to show you all the things you are looking at interactively ($15 extra), and they have docents giving talks and answering questions the whole time. There is a bar/cafe and a concession area up top next to the gift shop so you can have a drink in the tallest building in the western hemisphere. There is much more room to get around in OWO versus ESB, and you don't feel like you are fighting for window space. There is no outside viewing at OWO (there was at the Twin Tower) as there is with ESB, but that really didn't detract from the experience. If I only had time or money to do one building, it would definitely be OWO. Combined with the 9/11 memorial, it can make for an emotional experience."

If you find yourself confused with all of the crowds just ask the very helpful attendants for help and directions. Videos presented during elevator rides up and down gave interesting context to the setting and history of One World and Manhattan. The stunning view at the top, once you get past the rather relentless merchandising, was well worth the ticket cost.

We purchased the VIP tickets in advance fearing we would have to wait in line a long time since it was during the holidays. I detest waiting in lines so I paid the $130 plus dollars for two tickets. However, when we arrived shortly before noon, the lines were not that long for the regular priced ticket holders. Of course, this could change on any given day. It may be better to check things out the day you want to go to see how long the lines are for regular tickets rather than purchasing the purchasing the higher priced tickets online. The view was great even though it was getting to be very foggy. We dined at the fine dining restaurant for lunch. The menu is limited. I only had a hamburger. My wife had a shrimp salad. We had a couple of craft beers and it was all very good. The service was excellent and we were seated facing out towards to city. Awesome lunch time view. I definitely recommend the experience. As with many tourist attractions they try and sell you on purchasing photographs of your group imaged in front of the new World Trade Center. Most of these are pretty lame but since we didn't look too bad in the photograph, we bought one. It will probably go in the drawer back home with all of the other staged photos we have taken over the years but if my grandchildren happen to find them 20 years from now, they will have to say Paw Paw and Mom Maw didn't look too bad. We opted not to get the Ipad's I didn't see much value in this option as I was just interested in having a spectacular view of the city, away from the crowd in the Observatory, while having a nice lunch and a couple of beers. I got just what I wanted. It was definitely one of the best lunch time views I have experienced."

The food was good, but expensive and the view was amazing. A soft drink was $5 plus tax. Yikes! A few things I didn't like. I felt like we waited in line to then wait in another line to then wait in another line to then wait in a group while they tried to sell us the Ipad program, and then FINALLY we were able to get to what we paid for. I also bought a pin when I made my reservation, but when I got to NYC I saw there were coupons all over for a free pin with your tickets. So that was a little annoying. And the last thing that really upset me was I reserved tickets for 4:00 so that we could see the sunset and see the skyline at night. I paid for them in advance. Then shortly before we were supposed to leave I get an email telling me that \"due to an unexpected event\" they will close at 1:00. I had to reschedule my time to 11AM. They didn't offer any compensation, explanations, or seem to even care. I feel like we were sold out to a higher bidder as I'm assuming the \"unexpected event\" was a private party. They could have at least given me my pin for free!"

If it were sunny, I know this would have been one of the highlights of our trip. The elevator ride is an absolute MUST! In fact, went down and it it back up, would have done it again, but it was time to leave. The ride starts out in the 1500's and brings you out into the present. The city changes right before your eyes. Small but nice gift shop. Areas where there is a local telling you about the city and giving out helpful information. The Cafe is a stand u and eat venue. Prices are a bit high, but you expect it. Next to the stand up restaurant is a sit down restaurant. Prices are high, but what else would you expect when you sit down to this awesome view. Yes, I would go back just to see this awesome sight."

The first landmark you see is Lady Liberty herself. The view is quite breathtaking. We went at sunset, so our pictures had the spectrum of colors. We walked around, but it was very crowded on Sunday, smelled like seafood and garlic from the restaurant, and a female announcer/tour-guide was talking too loudly into her microphone. So, after half an hour, we found the hidden exit line and made our way back to ground level. I am glad I experienced it, but I would not return unless I take a first-time traveler to New York."

The experience could be great if they organizers would just get rid of the obnoxious 'Greatest Show on Earth' music and the 'Tony the Tiger 'voice that tells you what to do and where to walk. My visit to the site was the first since I saw the remains of the twin towers in smoldering ruins and I expected the atmosphere to be rather quiet, respectful and subdued. Instead, it was loud, intrusive and manipulative. From the moment we entered the elevator, the swelling music started. The imaginative video of the changing Ny landscape through the centuries was impressive, but it did not need a soundtrack. Upon arrival, we had to wait on the exit platform while we again got the loud stirring music and flashing lights, I guess to evoke breathlessness of the moment as the curtains finally lifted and we could see the view (which requires no such build-up). But wait, we could not remain in front of that view--we had to move on, two escalators down, to another level to appreciate the view. There, upon arrival, visitors are directed to a space without being told that it is for a photo that they should then buy as a souvenir (I didn't want one, thank you). Escaping the photo op, the crowds can walk around freely, take their own photos and look at the city and suburbs from every direction. The only intrusive element is a public presentation given every half-hour or so in which the speaker talks about some of the more famous landmarks and also the new buildings, complete with multi-million dollar prices for certain apartments and the celebrity inhabitants. Is that really necessary? There are rentable iPads that provide lots of that information and everyone else does not have to listen. One could install maps on the floor or raised panels identifying the buildings in each direction so all would have access freely to the information, but the presentations are a bit overpowering. I left quicker than expected to see the Calatrava memorial and walk around the beautiful memorial garden with the two sunken waterfalls, enjoying only the noise of the city as I remembered the immense tragedy and loss of life that had taken place here on a day that scarred us all forever."

The line moved pretty quickly and we were on our way. You'll get led to the elevator that takes you to the observatory, it's really fast. While you're in there a video will play on the back panel of the elevator showing a timeline of manhattan. When you get to the observatory you will be shown a feel good video about NYC which is very entertaining. It concludes with the opening of a shade that reveals the view outside. After this you are free to roam around the whole floor for as long as you'd like. They also have a gift shop and cafe up there. Overall it's truly amazing, definitely something to do if you're in the city."

( our baby jogger is a 2 piece stroller so not that easy) We then had to carry the stroller up the lift, into the theatre, thru a speech, down an escalator before we could open it up. Painful huh!!!! Parents had babies sleeping and had to wake the babies up (never wake a sleeping baby I'm told) Once at the top the stroller could be used, and then in the lift back down - the same one we were advised to fold it up in. I don't have a issue if strollers can't be taken, however knowing this prior to doing the tour would have been handy, or a stroller storage area could be handy. Once on top the view is amazing, you can see everything.

Like other NYC attractions there were long lines, high costs, and many sales pitches. However, compared to other attractions, the upsells here are designed to prevent and impede you. For example, the cheesy group picture and interactive tablet pitches are forced upon you after the elevator ride (at two different spots) and you are prevented from bypassing them by the staff. And want a view from the highest level? Be prepared to fork over more money at an overpriced restaurant.Also, while the views of the city are nice, the functionality of how they are accessed is terrible. First, there is no outside deck as compared to other skyscrapers meaning any pictures will be through windows that are smudgy or full of glare. Second, the best/straight ahead views are roped off and are reserved for staff presentations called \"City Pulse\". Third, there was a structure blocking direct access to the windows that visitors used as a bench. Therefore, most of the windows had people sitting in front of them and you had to reach over them to take pictures or ask them to move. Fourth, the windows were not designed to maximize views and have poles every 5 feet, so it is nearly impossible to get an unobstructed view without putting your camera inches from the glass. I understand the building is an office building, but the space could have been used much better to be transformed into an observatory.If your goal is to take a picture of your group with the NYC skyline, especially the Empire State Building in background, be prepared to be disappointed. It is the equivalent of taking a picture from a window seat of an airplane while landing. Sure the views are nice, but calling this an observatory is a stretch. Having been to the original WTC observation deck, others in NYC, other cities, and other countries, this was by far the worst I have experienced. Yes, the elevator ride was unique, but a time lapse of the development of Manhattan has been done countless times by History Channel, Discovery Channel, etc.Another piece of advice... Paying extra for a \"flex time\" or \"expedited entry\" is another rip off. Nobody ever checked what time we had purchased for (and people around us had times all throughout the day) and an expedited ticket only allows you to cut the security line. On the day we were there, the security line was very crowded (to the end of the ropes) and still took less than 10 minutes.Needless to say, even though we visited on a clear day, my wife and I did not enjoy our experience and felt that it was instead a slick money making scheme. We won't be back and have advised friends and relatives to visit other look-outs in the city instead. Such a shame considering what this could be."

Yes it can be expensive taking an entire family up but if you're taking a trip to NYC and planning to spend any time doing the sights and enjoying the food just prepare ahead of time to spend the money to enjoy the sights you may never get an opportunity to see again. My only other trip to NYC was pre 9/11 and on the day I visited the towers the observation deck was closed for a private party ... at the time I thought nothing of it thinking one day I'd return and see it then ... instead everything changed that one tragic day and when I returned with my family there was NO WAY we weren't going up. Perhaps the most difficult thing to figure out is when to go up ... we had a mixture of weather days while in town and went up on a fairly clear day. However at the time we went up the fall sun was already pretty low on the horizon and it took away from the view towards the Statue of Liberty and made taking photos in that direction equally trying (at least with my basic iPhone 5s camera). Of course if you're going to see this tower you'll probably check out the 9/11 memorial too and that is so nicely done ... we did it afterwards frankly because my youngest is already not that fond of heights and I didn't want her thinking too much about what happened that day while up at the observatory. On a side note ... if you haven't seen the documentary Man on a Wire or the movie The Walk I'd highly recommend seeing at least one before you go see the observatory ... then while up in the observatory imagine what it would be like to step off onto a wire to walk away from the tower ... then once you're back on the ground go see the memorial and position yourself in the area where you'd have to travel from one tower to the next all on just a wire at the height you were just up at."

One of the very few things in life to leave me speechless and a little emotional. We planned to do the Empire State and the Top Of The Rock as well as this. We did the Empire State the night before this and glad we did as it was great to see the city at night, all lit up. However we couldn't see the point of going up the Rock after this so didn't bother. You will read on other reviews about the elevator ride, and it really was enjoyable and very clever. When you get to the top, you then get to watch a short film on a big wall. What happened at the end of the film left me gobsmacked as I wasn't expecting it. Awe inspiring. I had a GoPro camera attached to my head and my only regret is that I had turned it off before the elevator ride back down, as this was just as enjoyable.It was a beautiful day when we went up and the 360 views of the city were incredible. It was 10am and no lines at all, went straight in and straight up. I didn't spend the extra 15 dollars on the tablets at the top as I couldn't see the point, so can't really comment. If you are visiting New York then this is a real must see."

Even the elevator ride up was spectacular as they showed the evolution of the Manhattan landscape over the last several hundred years. Of course the view was unbelievable!!!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting New York. I would have given an \"excellent\" rating but the cost of $32 is absurdly expensive. It seems pretty greedy to me. And when you get to the observation deck, they continue to market and sell other products to make even more money. The locator device should have been included in the $32 but instead they charge an additional $15 for it. Even though it's expensive, it is worth it."

            "review": "A great experience!. In August 2015, my brother, mother, her partner and I went to New York. There were a lot of sites and landmarks to go to and see, one of them was One World Observatory. Although I was not looking forward to going there, it was really good. As it was built in 2012-2013, there are a lot of big screens and modern technology in the building. For example, when you walk in, there is an enormous screen with a video talking about the collapse of the Twin Towers. Also, in the lift (or elevator as they call it) that takes you to the 102nd floor, the walls are screens. The screens show the New York skyline changing through the years. One World Observatory was built in memory of 9/11 and the Twin Towers collapsing. There is a 360 degree view of New York City where you can see all of the famous buildings such as The Empire State building and The Chrysler building. Also guides are in the observatory telling you about these famous landmarks that you can see. In my opinion, the view was fantastic. I took many photos and will treasure them forever. However, what I did not like about One World Observatory was that there was a lot of security. I understand that there needs to be security because of the terrorist attack that happened there however it did take a long time. To further enhance your experience, you can hire a tablet (like the ones that you get onboard the London Eye but portable) which is very advanced. For example, when you turn the tablet, it shows you what it is pointing at in terms of New York City (e.g. if you are pointing it north of the observatory, you would see the the Empire State building and things in that area). You can also tap on the landmarks to see what they are and to get information about them. It looked really fun to use when the workers showed us and I wanted to get one it however it was $15 to rent which was quite expensive. On the other hand, you could just look in front of you and see the view! One World is great for everyone to visit as it will give them an experience they will never forget. Tourists can see the fantastic view of New York from the highest building in the city. Also they can be educated on 9/11 as One World is a 9/11 memorial after all. If you are going though, allow at least an hour to see the view and browse the merchandise in the shop available. Also, take a camera with lots of storage on it! Jay Mittal, age 12"

I've been several times on top of the Empire State Building and Top Of The Rock, so I had to see how the view from the One World Observatory was holding up against the other two. I visited on a clear sunny day in November. Everything was very well organized and going up in the super fast elevators with a virtual projection of the history of the city was a blast. And yes, the views are spectacular, but... you are behind glass, with the inevitable reflections and smears from many hands and noses, whereas on the other two you are standing in the open air. But the biggest disappointment was that the windows have a slightly green tinge, which is fairly normal for reinforced glass, but it means that your pictures all end up looking too green! For someone like me who loves taking pictures with a decent camera, this was not good. It meant spending a good deal of time at home adjusting the colors in a photo editor. You can even see the green tinge on the picture here on Tripadvisor. Besides, I still think the view from the Empire State Building is still superior as you feel more surrounded by the city and it is the only one from which you have a perfect view of the most beautiful building in Manhattan - the Chrysler Building. Top Of The Rock is also very good as you can see Central Park, but don't bother going up there when it's dark, as the park is also dark at night. So if you only have time or money to do one of the three, go for the good old ESB!"

            "review": "WTC 1 vs Empire State Building - which one is worth your money?. One World Observatory on top of the new World Trade Center building could be so much more if they had a little less. A little less used car salesmanship to upsell, a little less Hollywood hype and a little less carnival mid-way on the actual observation deck. Like other reviewers, I do have to say that the views from WTC were amazing (a solid 5) and the elevator rides up and down were outstanding (another solid 5) but the problems occur when you get off the elevator. You are immediately herded like sheep through a series of high pressure upselling events (photos, electronic viewers, etc.) where they make you stop and listen to sales pitches to find out you actually have to go \"down\" two floors to the observatory. Be the rude visitor and push thru the crowd and the carnival \"barkers\" if you don't want to wait for these events. Skip the 101st floor altogether unless your hungry (it's a food court) and go down to the 100th floor. Here is where \"less\" carnival midway should be incorporated. As I mentioned the views are outstanding but the entire time you are on the floor two speakers are playing NYC trivia games on opposite sides of the building. It is distracting especially if, like us, you did the 9-11 Museum first and were still in the somber mood from that experience. On the other side is the Empire State Building (86th floor). Yes it isn't as high but the views are still great. They also have the same series of upselling opportunities (photos, gift shop, etc.) but they do it while you are waiting in line and allow you to respectfully decline and continue on if you don't desire to partake. When you get to the top, there is no pressure to do anything but enjoy the views. Also there is something special about being able to go outside and feel the wind blowing as you look over the edge. So for the money I vote Empire State Building 86th floor (the basic WTC and Empire State Building 86th floor are about the same price)."

My family visited one world observatory this past weekend and despite initial discussions about whether or not we wanted to spend the $100 for the three of us to visit, we decided that it was an opportunity we could not pass up.Simply put, the experience was worth every penny they charge, they ride up is like an amusement park ride and the production value of even waiting in line for the elevator is excellent with video boards and testimonials from the laborers that constructed the new tower.Once you are up at the top the views are better than you could ever imagine and everything was done high end. The atmosphere is beautiful and it appears that no corners were cut.My families biggest take away is how well they do at hiring their staff at OWO. Everyone from the ticket taker to the guides are some of the nicest people we encountered our entire visit to the city. There appears to be a conscious effort to hire quality people with excellent attitudes.We ate lunch at the restaurant at the top of the observatory and enjoyed magnificent views of the entire city. The menu was expensive but I would estimate about a 10% mark up over standard NYC prices. The quality of food was excellent and the views and atmosphere more than offset the premium. (Cocktails were not as great a value as the food, I would guess a 20-25% mark up from standard NY prices).My entire family could not have been more pleased with the experience, I will definitely be headed back again solo sometime so I can spend more time exploring the nuances of the attraction.Highly recommend - PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS ON-LINE AHEAD OF TIME. We breezed through security and did not wait in any line for more than a few minutes. We also went at 11AM and the observatory got much busier as the afternoon went on."

We didn't book tickets in advance as we didn't know what the weather would be like But on our second day the weather was absolutely gorgeous so we went online and booked two tickets. We didn't need to print them out but just show them on our phones to gain entry. The journey both up and down was very smooth an organised. You need to go through security which you need to do in a lot of places so it was very organised and thorough. The views you see are fantastic right over to the statue of liberty and uptown to the Empire state building. We spent quite a while up here just taking it in. We didn't stay until sunset or night time though (we visited at about 1pm) so the day time views were great."

Everything was well organized and we got to the top quickly (via repurchased tickets). There was a lot of space and windows for viewing, but the sun shines in very bright & the glass has a very bad glare. I thought we would be able to look down and see the memorial but b/c of the glare, it wasn't possible. The elevator ride was very cool, though! Overall, I'm glad I went, but if you haven't seen some of the other towers/views, I might take that over this."

It was nice to visit and it was alittle confusing because they do at the beginning try to get you to use the ipad and you really dont know whats going on until you are cornered for it. I walked pass that because I saw no need for it. Sounds like you had to pay for it. The next step is they lead you right in to taking pictures and we didnt need that either. We just wanted to see the sites and some reason was not that spectacular as we were hoping. No information on the building of the building or anything. Just look out the window. Take pictures and just relax there. Dont buy food there. I bought Grill cheese sandwiches and it cost me over $40 to with drinks. outragious. As well as they charge you for a tip. You have to select the required tip to give them. It is not an option to not give a tip. Especially if you get your own food. Double outrageous. We were there for only about 45mins. The best place to really go is the 911 museum just outside near the foot prints. If you experienced that that day, there is no holding back tears. It is filled with everything of that day. That I highly recommend."

The elevator ride up was cool. Got up to the top and was swamped by employees. Watched the cheesy movie and then the view. That was ok, but herded us out quickly. Had to sit for a sales pitch, WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THAT. If I pay $32 per person to go up, I do not want to sit for a 5 minute sales pitch on how to spend more money. The view was nice, but not as good as Empire State Building. Glass walls reflect everything, and fortunitly it wasnt busy but hearing from others it is hard to get a view on a busy day. The information kiosk people was a nice touch. Overall, I feel like this was a good idea gone commercialized. Everywhere they wanted you to buy more stuff. Was fine for the first time, but wont be coming back. Rather do the Empire or Rock instead."

Surely this should be done before entry?The elevator ride to floor 102 is super quick and once you reach this level and exit you experience a virtual tour of what you will see in a short while.The 360 degree view is spectacular, with Manhattan, the other boroughs of New York and New Jersey spread out below. We were fortunate that the weather was clear and we could genuinely \"see forever\". In fact the curvature of the earth is visible in the distance.

I visited the Towers when they stood tall and proud, Windows of the World restaurant - Excellent Food with a wonderful view. I also visited after the tragedy of 9/11 the devastation and sadness was horrific. Now I was on my way once again to see the Memorial and the new -Freedom Tower.The memorial, the pools, the grounds are fantastic. Dignified, solemn and memorable. After some reflection and silence, off we went to see One World Observatory.I opted for the upgrade to express entry which for about 60% more than general admission allows you to enter a special line which cuts down significantly on the wait to get to the top of the building where the observation deck is located. The elevator ride is fast - very fast and on the way to floor 102 the walls show a video representation of how times have changed - from around the 1500's to present day NYC. Impressive but very fast. Arriving at the 102 floor you are greeted by a sales presentation about how to rent, for a fee, an iPad that will \"..significantly improve your viewing experience.\" After the sales presentation (You are still not able to see out the observatory windows), you are shuffled into another area where your photo will be taken to again improve your experience and provide a memory of the visit. This photo can be viewed - and purchased - upon leaving the observatory. You are then released to the gift shop where of course you can purchase items for remembrance etc. ( i remember when the gift shop was at t he exit - now it is at the beginning) Then you are free to see the very excellent views of New York and surrounding areas.All this searching for more money was done in the most courteous and professorial manner - no pushiness, no strong arm - all in good fun - jolly ho! , yet for me? well it was a bit too much. Too crass, too glitzy. Just -- Over Done. I give the view, the staff and the planning four to five stars. I give the experience over all much less.Of course the view was spectacular - how could it not be? Tallest building in the USA, 360 degree view of a fantastic exhilarating city and surrounding cities and a photo op at every turn. By all means do not miss this - just be ready for the $earch."

They give you the opportunity to pay way more (as high as $85.00) if you are not willing to stand in line and consider yourself rich enough. Another negative is that all the windows are angled in such a way as to cause the overhead ceiling lights to reflect off the windows onto the photos you take of the majestic views.

Once inside and in the second line, we were informed that the observation deck was closing at 100 .. we had 1215 tickets that equated to actually getting into the very crowded observation deck (after a total of waiting in six lines to actually get up to the top) at 1245. 15 minutes, we paid for 15 minutes of time before being forced out. There was no mention of the early closing time when we booked the tickets ... What a complete ripoff!!The view is beautiful, everything else about the cheesy elevator ride, artificial bedrock and multiple pushy attempts to get you to spend more money is disgraceful.Save your $. Visit the rock for the views and the respectful, poignant 9/11 museum , but skip this."

Also interesting view of St. Paul's Chapel, one of the few places after Sep 11 where there was a viewing stand to observe the ruins of the World Trade Center. Wish they had better markers for the main sites seen from each window. They charge for the use of iPad type equipment that will narrate what you are looking at. Not sure it is worth it."

However, they cannot compare to the freedom tower. I and my friend visit on December 10, 2015, at 4.00 PM so we can get a view of the day and sun set, too bad it's cloudy but still it quite acceptable.They said there will be 3 levels, the first one when you arrive, you will be queueing up waiting for the movie. After the movie end, the screen will rise and show you the view, yes it's really amazing, except you will be told to move forward right away. Not to mention that you have to look through a glass window, which will reflect your surrounding any time you try to take a picture.When you arrive in the next room, they try to convince you for the tablet . Lucky for me that I already read some review so we skip that part. Then you go 1 level down, seriously?, to the mezzanine. You will see one level below, if I remember correctly, they called The discovery level. On the mezzanine they exclude one part to be a dining area. I didn't try that because we have another schedule. I will skip this one.After that we go down to the discovery level. The one where you will have most of the view, except it obstruct by a glass window, again. To me the name of this tower is quite mislead, freedom tower? How can you call it freedom when you need to be inside and cannot go outside. I read that in this level, there will be a sky portal where you can see downstair. And I found it, with totally disappointment. It's not a clear glass you can look through. It's a monitor to project records from the camera around the tower and when we arrive, they were not working!I have to ask the staff if there anything wrong and it take around 20 to get it work and when it work I really disappointed. Let's say when the sky portal work, the sun is already set and we got a night view. If you want to play the view from that camera, at least consider playing the movie from the same time. We got a daytime feed in the night. Seriously? We left shorty after that, compare to the Rockefeller I visit the day before, this is a real mess. Maybe I should go there during the daytime, maybe I should select a sunny day to go to the observatory. i don't know, but I won't recommend that to my friends. It doesn't worth $32 you've spent."

Yes there are other people there who will get in your way. The view is intended for you to look, not take professional quality photos with your prepaid cell phone.

One of the most fun things on the 'tour' is the video timeline that is shown on the electronic screen walls of the elevator as you ascend to the top of the building, so try to be in an elevator that's not too crowded and position yourself to be able to watch. The iPad rental thing hard sell at the top is a complete waste of money. It is supposed to tell you all the places you are looking at when you point it out the window, but it only has a limited number of buildings programmed in. There is no external component at all, so even on the most gorgeous day you can't go outside, you are always confined indoors. I'd probably not do it again but I'm glad I did it once."

There is a fountain of sorts at the exact location of one of the towers. In the area there is also The 9/11 museum and not too far away is the church where a lot of activity took place on that day. The church is a DO NOT MISS site...a lot of information is available with photos etc. To visit the tower from Grand Central is an easy ride downtown on the #4 subway. I would suggest purchasing tickets on line in case there are long lines at the tower. Tickets are expensive $32 per adult, $30 for Seniors....I had high expectations from all I had read about the tower. As you enter the hallway you see scenes from the building of the tower but often you are missing what is being said because you are walking. The tower was basically an expensive elevator ride up to the 103rd floor to view the harbor and the city. It is an inside elevator with a superimposed photo of the outdoors....Once at the top you can walk around the entire area and have great views. There is a sit down restaurant which you might need reservations for. There is also a snack area serving pretzels, brownies, cake etc and a bit further on you can get a drink, yogurt, slice of pizza etc. There were 3 of us and we had a pretzel, a brownie and a pastry and 2 waters for @ $40. Nothing is inexpensive here."

We visited the WTC observatory choosing the sunset pass (no waiting in line) which allowed us to view the skyline at sunset (there was a winter smog inversion) and then see the city change to night time. Pretty cool, and worth the price to not stand in line, but pricey as Gen Admin tic's were $32 and these were $59 each. The line looked like you may be standing there for a while, 1-2 hours. Views of the city are great, and just being down in that area is wonderful to see what's been done with buildings, pools, etc . . .Warning: lots of construction going on."

A coffee was $6 and a small hotdog the same price, so for three of us we paid $36 for a snack. We then took our food to the tables, only to find no chairs as this is a 'standing only' venue. Our 70 year old mum (who had spent the previous 2 days touring New York sights) found this a struggle.The coffee was very weak and tasteless and the hot dogs nothing special.

Then you are shown a rather nice two-minute reveal video. They offer (for rent) ipads which will help you identify landmarks. The observation area is fully roundabout and there is a cafeteria and gift shop.

The day we arrived there were a thick fog and zero visibility from the observation deck. This was our only chance to try out the restaurant during our stay, and to rebook the table we would have to stay for another week.. Obviously not an option. We did enter the observation deck knowing we would not be able to see anything only to enjoy the food. Due to the weather there were hardly any people at all in the building. The elevator is really cool and gives you a quick history lesson in how New York was populated. At the top we were greeted by a salesman telling us that do to the zero visibility they now had a special offer on renting iPads. That way people at least got to see pictures of the view since the windows where closed by fog. We actually thought they would rent these out free, but no - the \"special offer\" was that you got two iPads for 15 $ instead of 15 $ each... Not exactly a good offer since the general admission costs 32 $ itself.. We got a bit irritated and said no thanks. We went around the deck seeing nothing before we entered the restaurant. The restaurant was great though. Food was good. Prices ok. The waiter was really nice and apologized for the bad weather, but tried to make the best of it for the three groups of people in the restaurant. After the meal he did advise us to talk to customer relations as we got back down. Normally there were helpful and rebooked tickets for people experiencing the same visibility as we did. When we got back down, after spending dollars at tickets, food, souvenirs and pictures, we went to the customer service desk - which was empty. After a while a small hipster arrived. We explained that we had been advised to talk to them because of the weather, and told him we went up because of the restaurant. We then asked if we could reschedule our tickets for the observatory to actually get to see the view as well. He just waived us away and told us that as long as the tickets was scanned we had no rights for new tickets. He was not even interested in hearing us out. We know it's our fault that we used the tickets despite knowing about the weather. But customer service is still customer service. If you can't do anything - that's ok. But this one was just rude.We left right away swearing to never get back. We had the same bad weather conditions at topof the rock the day before, but they re-booked the tickets with no questions asked. We went to Top Of the Rock the next day and got some excellent views."

We booked on-line before hand so we were straight through once we had done security. If you want to look at specific locations to find a place there are ipad available. The trip in the lift shows how the landscape of new york has changed over time. It was escalators only to the observatory deck the staff were very helpful and friendly and took me through the back way as I stupidly can't go down escalators. Well done on such a fantastic building."

As one who had been up the original WTC , it was important that the new Freedom tower gave people the chance to enjoy the unique vistas of New York from a great height. I felt it can be improved. The ultimate sensation of standing uncovered on top of a tall building has been lost . The observation decks are covered, so people are jostling for the best \" selfies.\" The legacy of the first towers is brief , and much of the space is occupied by pricey souvenirs and dining."

We happened to book our tickets for a day that was very cloudy/rainy. When we got there, the staff warned us there was 0% visibility and offered to move our tickets to another day, We decided to go up anyway, and I'm glad we did! The clouds cleared up almost right away, and it wasn't crowded at all due to the clouds. My son got to really run around and explore. No wait at the restaurant either- though we weren't impressed with that (not at all geared towards children/families, though the views are amazing). Gift shop was overpriced- we found better souvenirs at one of the many nearby gift shops. We opted to purchase the photo they took as well- good way to remember the day. All in all a fun day, and I'm glad we went. Wouldn't go back simply because you see all you need to in one visit."

I wish you could buy a video of this because it was fascinating - but goes so quickly. I was totally unprepared for it.

We booked the slot on the Internet swiftly and efficiently. This proved to be a great decision and we were delighted, however we had not planned for the bonus. This was a most magnificent sunset.Having seen all the sights we decided to finish the visit with a glass of wine in the comfortable bar/restaurant and were treated to a second bonus.

Having visited the Empire State last time in New York this was a much anticipated visit, especially as we had seen the Tower while it was under construction. It's very easy to find and the cab from mid-town cost us about $20. The queue was efficiently managed although we did have to stand outside in the drizzle for 10-15 minutes. Security check was thorough but not particularly intrusive. The lift the viewing area is incredibly smooth and the prep video helps to build the sense of anticipation. The day we toured was cloudy and patrons were advised of limited views with the offer of re-booking (no refunds!). The cloud did clear and the evening views across the city were spectacular. The staff presentations were very informative and there were very helpful staff on hand to answer individual questions. We rented a tablet ($15) to enhance the viewing information and this is well worth the money. The viewing area while busy was not crowded and there was no need on this occasion to jostle for a viewing space. Perhaps on a better weather day this might not have been the case. The only downside was the intransigence of staff at the souvenir area where they refused to exchange a gift which had been previously purchased as the original receipts were not present but the goods still had the original tags attached. All-in-all well worth a visit for the views of the city."

Having been to NYC in 2013 and done a lot of the tourist attractions then we were really looking forward to a trip up the One World Observatory this time, having seen it being built back in 2013The ticket price is very expensive at $32 per adult but I was hopeful the money would be well spent... Unfortunately I was very wrong. There is very little about the tower and history of the trade centre in the downstairs museum (I guess this is covered by the 9/11 memorial museum which we didn't get chance to visit) which was disappointing. The whole experience is very commercialised, guests are made to listen to a pitch for screen rentals to help you look out of the window! ($15!) before being allowed onto the viewing platform and the gift shop is right in the middle of the viewing area.The initial wow factor as the windows open up on arrival soon disappears on the viewing platform. As mentioned by a few other reviewers, it is almost impossible to get any decent pictures of the view, with dirty windows, number of people sitting on the window ledgers and a really bad reflection of the whole interior of the observatory. Certainly not worth wasting precious hours visiting here, when there's the top of the Rock and Empire State building with magnificent views over Manhattan or a trip to Brooklyn for a picture of the Manhattan skylineOnly plus side was the free water fountain"

Being a hobby photographer I would have appreciated breaks in the glass like the Empire State and Top of the Rock, as getting decent photographs through glass is difficult. The glass often dirty and covered in hand marks!The only downsides,a visual iPad guide is available and they wanted a non refundable charge to use it, other buildings offer a free Audio guide at least or interactive telescopes (shard) considering the ticket price, I feel this should be factored in. A cafe which was lacking in choice and its staff who reacted very slowly to prepare drinks.Overall...Well worth the visit"

If you can afford it, we found it worth it to skip to the front of the line and we were on the elevator in minutes. The elevator is very entertaining in itself and that is where things start to go \"disney-ish\". Once out of the elevator you are forced to watch a boring, movie-like montage on the wall. A Disney strategy I assume, in order to allow more people to empty out of the actual viewing areas. After the movie, you are shepherded to another area where a few guides tried to tell us we had to stand in a circle around them for their \"presentation.\" Knowing we were minutes from sunset and knowing that you DO NOT have to stay and listen, we flew downstairs are were able to just see the sun drop down in a flash of red. We stayed until the lights went on everywhere and it was magical.NOTE: The biggest complaint I have is that there is NO SEATING anywhere outside of the restaurant. As a result, extremely rude people plant themselves on the air vent that unfortunately lines the windows, so when you try to get close for a photo and to admire the view, there are people sitting and perusing their iPhones, completely ignoring that your child is trying to see around them. The fault lies more with the planning--adding a few benches would help the situation. I guess it's intentional and they are trying to get more people up and out and don't want loiterers."

Firstly, the building itself is beautiful and the views are fantastic, only the windows make photography a little disappointing. Secondly, on arrival at the tower we asked about whether we could use our city pass and were told it wasn't part of it. No bother - we passed a group of 3 or 4 staff who seemed much more interested in their own conversation than customers, to get half was down the queue and he shouted back by one of them to join a different queue. This young lady looked at us as if we were something she stepped on. So, in the right queue we went, got to the counted to be greeted by the Christmas grinch herself. We asked politely for 2 adult tickets, got no eye context, no smile, no conversation....she then proceeded to bark the price at us in her delightful manner. The price was $64. I placed our first $50 on the counter and was fishing out our other $20 bill, when the grinch barked at us 'I SAID 64 DOLLARS!'. We then had our change and our tickets thrown through the counter at us, with not so much as a thank you. Coming from someone who works in customer services, I was absolutely disgusted by the service we received here and will likely tell others of our experience here."

Obviously there was nothing we could do about this. We went inside after spending a few moments at the 9/11 memorial. Once inside as we already had our tickets we went down the escalator heading to security. I do think there could be more signs telling you where to go as it was a tad confusing when we got down stairs. We where scanned and pointed to the lifts.The lifts...... are amazing. Make sure you have your camera ready. Once up to floor 102 your guided to the theatre. You stand and watch a short video of the history and then you need to be recording this bit. You will be speachless, that's all I'm saying just be prepared.After this small section your free to wander around the observation deck. It's amazing. A 360\u00b0 view of the amazing city. We where lucky as it was a clear night by thetimewe had reached thetop. And one of the best sun sets we have ever seen. It was spectacular. You can wander around taking pictures till your hearts content. They have a sky view circle in the middle of the floor, personally I wasn't sure what this was about so I didn't stay on it much. The shop was good for little souvenirs. All round excellent experience. It's just sad to think that this amazing experience has resulted from one of the most tragic events in our life time. In memory of everyone who was affected by the events of 9/11. RIP xxxx"

There is one hour free wifi available to visitors. There are food outlets and a shop, but as expected these were charging exorbitant prices. All in all, i'd recommend a visit for the fabulous views."

The initial entry after clearing security was fake bedrock and tacky. Great idea, but they should just have had some real bedrock and not make it look like some cheap amusement park attraction. Ride up (and down) in the elevator well done. Once at the top you have to endure a hard sell where they keep you captive in a room and try to convince you to rent iPads which will tell you what you are looking at in the city below when you point them at it. You probably can just walk past it, but they make it look like it is an official part of the tour, and then you realize they are selling you and it is offensive. Right after that one they then line you up for some photo they will try to sell you when you get back to ground level. By then we figured out the hard sell and just told them no and walked past without getting our pictures taken. The observation deck is well done and the views magnificent. There is a \"Sky Portal\" that is supposed allow you to experience standing on a glass floor and look down to the street below, but it is fake - it is just a video of the street below projected onto a glass circle. Sort of the same amusement park approach. Given the history of the building and the site, with 9/11, etc., it seems like they could have had some exhibit somewhere that addressed all that to some extent. And it really needs to lose the hard sell and Disneyland feel."

Then, a line weaving you through fake rocks and TV screens with stories from contractors who built the building. Then, a line into the elevator. Then, another line at the top leading you into a theater for a video presentation. An hour after you first entered the building, you are finally able to reach the observation deck. The view is nice and it would be nice to get up to the windows except for the dopes blocking them. You see, all along the bottoms of the windows they have the HVAC vents. People use these vents as benchs and they will sit there all day on their phones texting, checking e-mails and playing games. They could care less you might want to get up to the window to look out or take pictures because they are texting the person sitting right next to them. If you must go spend the extra cash and purchase the Priority tickets and save yourself a bunch of time."

I brought my family from California anticipating that this observation would be special and indeed, it was beyond my expectations. The information provided on the lower level gallery-type, museum walk was an excellent segue to getting on the high-speed elevators to the 106th floor. When we exited, the suspense continued when a group of us watched a video against a wall that had the shape of buildings. This wall raised up and revealed the spectacular view. It was like being in an airplane but the viewer is in control of how long they can view along a 360 degree opportunity. It was very peaceful and made you wonder many things such as the beauty of this planet, the amazing people who were involved in bringing this to fruition, and the peacefulness of simply watching boats and ships move along the waterways. It is something that many should experience. Being that I am originally from NY and visited the previous twin towers as a youth, this visit had a personal, emotional impact that centered on not allowing a tragic event to prevent one from rebuilding and moving forward."

We had tickets for 9AM which I think was an excellent choice as it seemed to be more crowded when we left. The line moved smoothly and we did not wait long. The staff was really warm, organized and welcoming and one even offered his jacket for my niece while she was waiting in line. The whole presentation, the build up to the top was beautifully done, informative, tugged at the heart while not being cloying. The elevator ride takes you through the years from ground level to the top which takes the sting out of such a quick ride to the top and is really brilliant. Once to the top the views are incredible. There were lots of people yet I never felt it was too crowded. Unlike my trip to the Empire State Building I was able to see well, no pushing, lots of chance to stand at the windows and marvel. There were two really wonderful presenters who talked about the cities history and attractions and gave helpful tips. You can rent, for 15.00, an IPAD that is interactive and assists you in locating and reading about the buildings you see. We rented one for our group of 5 and while I didn't use it much my 8 year old niece did and I think it was worth it. The elevators were really not crowded. Overall I was just really impressed and felt that it was a highlight of my trip and reasonably priced. It turned out to be gorgeous weather for a late November day and a walk along the river by the tower made it all perfect."

The views at the time were unparalleled, so we were really keen on this trip, the first for 10 years, to see how it's shiny replacement would stand up.I booked online tickets in advance, the standard $32 ones after having read tips on TA, left it until the last moment having checked out the weather forecast to try to get the clearest day possible on our stay. We were lucky, not a cloud in the sky, and after the elevator trip up (recommend having your video ready) we were shown through to another room which ended in a real spectacle, I won't spoil it, before being shown through to the observatory.The views, as you would expect, were stunning. Our tickets were timed for 3:15, there were no queues to get in, no hanging around but as per another reviewers comments, I chose this time as sunset was due just after 4:30 so we stayed not only to get the daytime shots, but also to watch the stunning sunset, just beyond the Statue of Liberty. This is a great tip (thank you reviewer) as you could purchase sunset tickets in advance but these were significantly more expensive.We left before full darkness, so got no nighttime shots, but there was no time limit to how long you stayed so could if one felt inclined, perhaps grab a coffee and bit to eat in the cafe first?!For the regular standard price tickets, I thought it was good value for money, although I don't think I would have apaid for the sunset, nighttime or expedited ones, or perhaps we were just lucky at the time of year we visited."

I have always wanted to pay my respects and finally go to do so in Nov 2015. I had seen that the One World Tower was a tourist attraction for its observatory before flying out but felt that it wouldn't compare to the Empire State or Top of the Rock, so we discounted it from our plans.How wrong we were!!!We hadn't intended visiting the tower but so glad we did. It's a little clich\u00e9 at the beginning with some typical American flair as you work your way through to the lifts. Then the lifts themselves are something else and a ride all of their own. I wont spoil it but they are fantastic and very swiftly get you to the top. At the top there is some more glitz and flair which, when taken in context of what happened, I think every New Yorker has the right to be proud of their resilience and accomplishments since 2001. After this and the revealing of the view the rest of the time you are left to your own devices to wander around a 360 degree utterly amazing view of New York. They even have a caf\u00e9 up there so you can chill with a coffee and enjoy the views.Having done the Empire State building on this trip too I would definitely recommend this to everyone. We were very lucky with almost no queue and when we came out the queue had grown quite a bit more but still worth it.The value is excellent too and over half the cost of Empire State and significantly more organised. So glad we did it and would recommend to anyone. Just make sure the weather is OK as the view probably wont be so good in bad weather."

With family in town, I brought them to see the new One World Observatory. The experience started off promising, but was largely disappointing. After a length security screening process (understandably), that was more thorough than most airports I've visited, you then pass through a bedrock-surrounding passage to the elevator bank. You are presented with various facts about the building and the construction process, as well as testimonials from some of those involved in the creation of it, which is fascinating and builds your excitement. It has a very Disney-esqe feel for a queue. The elevator ride to the top is exhilarating and well done. Then you are corralled into a room and see a presentation with fantastic imagery of NYC with an eye-opening surprise glimpse at the end. Up to that point, I was starting to feel that the $30+ that we paid for our tickets may have been justifiable. From there, the experience greatly diminished. At this point, everyone is anxious to see the views and instead of permitting this, the staff practically forces you to take a picture in front of a green screen (that, given the price, there is no chance you will buy) and then tries to pitch you to rent an iPad that points out all the popular attractions for an additional $15. You then need to bypass the restaurant and souvenir shop before you can finally approach the unpolished and heavily smudged glass to take in the \"360 views\". It is hardly fair to call this a 360 view (as they advertise), given that at 2 strategic viewpoints they have placed these circular monitor structures that make it impossible to actually take in the view behind them. Also, most glaringly (and unexpected for many), there is no outdoor platform to take in the view. This stands in stark contrast to the two other most well-known observatories in the city, the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock, both of which have outdoor platforms. As well as in contrast to the previous World Trade Center which included an outdoor observatory platform. This was perhaps the biggest disappointment for many, including me. Ultimately, I was left with a feel that my beloved Yankees (which own One World Observatory) had done everything they could to squeeze every last dime out of the tourists and locals alike, that pay tribute to and take in the views from the location where New York has strived to overcome the greatest attack this nation ever faced."

I was surprised (shouldn't have been the way society has become!) at how many people decided to just lounge in front of the windows with the best view so they could keep their heads buried in their iPhones rather than enjoying the view, or more importantly, letting others enjoy the view.

There were no queues we bought our tickets on the day and were straight in and straight up to the top. A must visit."

And everything was easier and quicker than the Top of the Rock. The queues moved quicker, security was easier and quicker and the lift to the top was quicker too.And the views are just amazing!

After going up the elevator which was one of the best parts of the \"tour\". you get to stand a watch a film which shows shots of NYC. When the movie is done the screen goes up for literally about 1 minute and you get a nice view. Then you get herded into a large room all the windows are covered on purpose so you have no view. They try to rent you Ipads. . Then you go up one floor where they ask how many people are in your party and take your picture in front of a blue screen. So they can sell you a picture later. Then you have to either go through or around a cafeteria so yo can finally get a view. The is of course the gift shop. When we got down stairs My wife and I went to customer service to complain about constantly being marketed to . His deck is attached to the people selling the photos. Literally with in 5 steps from his desk in side the building there are people giving you a \"gift\" , which is a discount coupon to a clothing store.There is no mention of 9/11. There is no reverence at all for the space. See the 9/11 memorial out side ."

My friend and I ended up buying tickets online in advanced - you have to select the day you want to go and you pick a certain time to go as well. We got to bypass the ticket line (which wasn't that busy when we passed by) and went straight to the entrance to go up to the observation deck. Once you enter, you get a quick history of New York. The elevator ride up is so cool - monitors showing you going higher up in the air, and showing how New York has evolved and changed throughout the years. Once you get to the top, you're shuffled off into an area where you go through more videos showing again how New York has changed but the really cool part is when those monitors move up and you see the skyline. Absolutely gorgeous. My friend who lives in New York and was playing tourist with me, was almost in tears. They do sell those little self-guided headsets for you to use. I ended up not investing in it. We went earlier in the day, so it the place wasn't overly crowded, so getting to a window to look out a the view wasn't too bad of a wait. So overall - buy tickets online/in advance, go earlier in the day to try to beat the crowd, and you have to go through security so make sure to not bring a gigantic purse."

BUT, they then lower the curtain and make you go to a lower level!! You are then subjected to a sales pitch (hard pressed) to rent a viewer that is not necessary. The actual viewing area is lower than the initial one and you do notice a difference. The refreshment/restuarant area has super expensive items as does the gift shop. I was disappointed and wish we could have just stayed on the top level and looked around. The price tag was high and not worth it."

The elevator experience to the top - 102 floors- is amazing. It shows a video of NYC from its beginning as grassland through the early settlement, development of buildings to skyscrapers ending in the present day. Once at the top you are guided downstairs to the discovery level - floor 100 that gives a 360 degree view of the city. We had a really amazing view of the sun setting and the many landmarks. An exciting experience well worth the $32 entrance fee, $30 for seniors"

Then you will see a movie about New York - just wait to the end to be really impressed. I had tears in my eyes. And of course the main part is observatory itself. The views are majestic. However there are no pictures with marks like: 1 - Empire State Building, 2 - Rockefeller Plaza, 3 - Brooklyn Bridge, etc. For the money you already spent you can expect it! You would be only offered to rent an I-Pad with information for additional $15. You cannot go outside, and there are no place to sit except windowsills. Keep in mind that it is difficult to take good pictures through the glass. You would be able to listen to some presentations about New York. We listened to one presentation about New York cheese cake and New York pizza, which was OK, and another presentation about building of Freedom tower, which was interesting. Overall going to Freedom Tower was a very rewarding experience."

With its one hundred-two floors. it is the tallest building in the western hemisphere. Speed and clever photos are the hallmarks of the many elevators which zip up to the top in sixty seconds, and there are video displays on the elevator walls of a timeline of NYC area from decades past to the present. The photos speed by as quickly as the elevator ascends (almost to the point ) I thought: \u201d What was that building I just saw added to the time-line city environs?\u201dThe observatory is built that so one circles around and down to the 101st floor, a mezzanine. There on the 101st are restaurants ; one for eating standing up (at the ONE MIX)\u00a0 or seated dining (at the ONE DINE) and then visitors circle down to the 100th floor for long viewing, and watching and listening to a lecturer discussing One World (OWO) and NYC.The highlights of my visit to the observatory are: viewing\" below and beyond\" and dining at ONE. In advance I bought on line standard admission timed tickets, and yes, there is a\u00a0 discount for seniors. I knew my/our day was tightly scheduled so the timed morning tickets really helped us without waiting in the outside queue. Once inside the foyer we used the circled queue to go through security which is as extensive as at airports. We felt safe, and knew not to take backpacks nor bottles of liquid (water is allowed) into One World. (There are guidelines for what is permitted to be carried in OWO on the observatory website.)All elevators zoom up to the 102nd floor where the experience begins, and one winds down a floor to the observation deck. Since we had lunch reservations we were lead down backstairs to the mezzanine area, and we were seated at ONE DINE, the fine dining restaurant with fantastic panorama views of NYC. The service was excellent, the views unparalleled, and the food* and its presentations were non pareil. We leisurely dined, viewed, and rested!* For dessert we shared the three layers of chocolate cake, chocolate mouse, and chocolate creme topped with chocolate ganache and homemade salted caramel ice cream.After sitting and dining at ONE DINE , we were recharged from our commute into the City, and the emotional visit to the impressive 9/11 Memorial and Museum. We walked part of the \u201cHigh Line\u201d up to Midtown, and \u201ccharged\u201d through many shops for already we had (to paraphrase the program Heroes): \u201cSeen NYC, Seen the World!\u201d"

After you go through the standard these days security checkpoints you slowly venture towards your elevator ride to the top. The elevator is probably nothing like you've ever experienced before. Three sides of the elevator are screens which provide the illusion that you are taking a glass elevator ride all the way to the 102nd floor. Eager to get to the spectacular views you wait in a line to enter a theater of all things. Initially frustrated by this you enter an area with a screen in front of you where the video talks briefly about NYC and just when you think let's get on with this the screens slowly rise to reveal the city views below. What a great idea to introduce you to the view. Then you're set free to explore in 360 views of the city. There are several places to grab food or drink there. We had lunch and the prices were reasonable given the location. We even got to witness a wedding proposal which elated the crowd. It would be a neat place to pop the question. When you're ready to leave you have the same unique 60 second video elevator ride to the bottom."

Our hotel in FiDi had an incredible view of the Freedom Tower and late one Friday we crossed the island and stood briefly in line just before dusk and had a wonderful visit to the top of the world ! The staff is amazing and they young people make everyone feel welcome and the wait seems brief ! I am told if you buy your ticket on line or on your phone it is even quicker. The building is amazing and the elevator incredibly unique. The two observation levels at the top are in describable and worth the $32 admission fee. There are great restaurants I am told as well but we only went for the 360 degree view and the experience. The ground zero area is a must for all visitors to the city even of one does not go to the tower or the museum."

This observation site on hallowed ground is pretty tastefully done, although the souvenir shops off the observation deck seemed to me a bit out of place, as were the upbeat presentations of the views by the energetic young folks who sounded a shade too much like game show barkers. Having said that, the testimony of those who worked on the building is very moving, and the views themselves are incredible. The price is not cheap, but judging from the crowds, there are many who will pay it. The view of the Statue of Liberty and nearby Ellis Island is, in fact, priceless."

There were zero lines or wait times, and only handful of other tourists, which was wonderful.The views were amazing on a clear, cold evening.I wish, I wish that on the observation level there weren't any ambient lights in the room at night. I was traveling with $5k in camera bodies and fast lenses, and couldn't get a decent photo unless my glass was touching the windows. I get that people would fall and sue in the dark, but still, a guy can dream.Ticket prices seemed fair.

But given the delays in initial service we were quite disgusted service charge was already applied to our bill. Clearly this explains the steady service, as there is no need to rush if you are guaranteed 18% no matter how you perform..The only person on the ball was the water guy!"

But they said maybe a 20 minute wait (Monday at noon). So while we waited in the outside line we purchased tickets online with our phone for the next tour. By the time we reached the front of the line -which moved quickly and was about a 20 min wait- we had our tickets and were directed downstairs and through the tunnel like entrance to the elevators and were up to the observation deck in about 30 min from when we decided to visit. We felt the introduction to the view was a bit melodramatic. We then had a forced plug for the iPad locator which my friend decided to pay for. It was somewhat helpful, but not great. Then finally we were led down more stairs where we were finally at the observation level on the 100th Floor, 1250 ft high. We loved the views and spent over an hour or more enjoying all the different vistas. Downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn are easily seen. The harbor, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governors Island are also great from here. Off in the distance is Staten Island, Verrazano Bridge, and Midtown. The Palisades are barely visible, but on a clear day like we had you can follow the path of the Hudson River north to them. I'm glad we went, it was a great day to enjoy the views of Lower Manhattan."

I live just outside NYC, and over the years have visited most of the big tourist attractions, the ones similar to the One World Observatory are, of course, Empire State and Rockefeller... Both of which give a far better overall experience and service.I visited One World Observatory with my grandmother on a cold day in November, by cold I mean 35f/3c with a biting wind. My grandmother had flown over from the UK to visit me and NYC.Our tickets were for 4:30pm, and said that we should arrive 15 mins early. So, we arrived at about 4:10pm only to see a long queue OUTSIDE the building. I thought 'ah they must be people waiting the buy tickets, we have tickets for 4:30 so we may be able to go straight in near that time'. I was mistaken. Upon enquiringly with the staff outside I was told that we would have to sit and wait outside and that the wait would be 'long' as it was by now 4:20pm and the 4pm queue had not even started moving yet.Now, whoever designed the entry system for this place has clearly never witnessed a New York Winter... I know of no other attraction like this in NYC where you are made to queue OUTSIDE.Now, if it was just myself and my girlfriend visiting, though I would have still been a little perturbed by having to queue in the cold until 5pm when we had tickets for 4:30pm, I would not have minded so much... But I had with me my 86 year old grandmother, who is not the steadiest on her feet and walks with a wheeled stroller... She too was made to queue OUTSIDE in the cold, nowhere for her to sit, no shelter. I repeatedly asked the staff if there was somewhere she could wait inside, but the response was negative (not just in wording, the staff did not seem to care at all).When we finally did get inside, it was clear that there was plenty of queuing space inside, but clearly they had decided that it was better to let their customers suffer in the cold.We then eventually got up to the observatory, and yes, of course the views are fantastic, but again, there was nowhere at all to sit down, we decided to get a hot drink in the cafe at the top, upon getting there it was clear that there was still nowhere to sit... And I don't just mean no free seats... I mean no seats whatsoever... Some tables, but no chairs/benches. I asked a staff member up there if they had any seats that my grandmother could sit on (by now she had been standing for the best part of an hour and a half, and at 86 that is not civilised)... The response to that question was a look of incredulity and 'I'll have to ask the supervisor'... So, a few minutes later a lady that I presume to be the supervisor appeared, was informed by the other staff member of our request and headed off in to the main restaurant, we assumed to fetch a chair... We assumed wrong, we did not see her again.The website says it's an attraction for people of all ages and caters for the disabled... That is simply not true... If you are elderly or slightly less a led then this is not the place for you to visit.Not only was the weather cold on our visit, but the attitude and greeting from most of the staff was cold too.All in all, well below par for a NYC attraction... Whoever is in charge here please visit the Empire State and Rockefeller centre to see how to do it properly, and put up some form of shelter for those queuing outside (or, even better, let people queue INSIDE).All in all, great views, but an underwhelming experience."

In a traffic pattern that has different streams of people crossing over each other (by the top of the escalators) with no signage or direction.Then, after security (which I understand is necessary), behold... a fake plastic version of the Manhattan schist bedrock they pretend to line the \"tunnel\" (cattle trough) with. Why bother? I'm certain there was plenty of real Manhattan bedrock around. It's as fake as the Hershey chocolate \"tour.\"The displays on the elevator ride were inspired and well done. Credit where it's due for that.Okay, we're at the top of the building. Time to look at the views, right?No. The uppermost public floor is given over to a nonsense video project and guys hawking iPads.Down one floor. To the views? No, to the restaurant.Down one floor more.Finally: After the badly managed traffic, after a battalion of GED types using the authority of their blue polo shirts to boss you around, after the fake rock, after the video tease, after the appeal to eat overpriced food and drink, they deign to let you see what you came for -- the view. By this point I was relieved it actually happened. I thought I was just going to get cattle-chuted into another door marked \"This Way to the Great Egress.\"I wish the people who ran this concession had designed it around the actual view, instead of treating the view as an afterthought. Everything leading up to it was a nuisance. Most of that nuisance was clearly pointless, unless you're a tourist concession trying to justify its existence.There are acres of floor space one level below the entrance, where they line people up for security. The \"waiting to wait\" lines could be moved there from the sidewalk. The gift shop could be moved there from the observatory floor.Please rework this so people \"experience\" less of your concession company and more of the view of New York City. I'm sorry it's the one part of this you can't take credit for. But it isn't about you."

I was so moved by the building of this structure and the innovativeness of how the elevators worked and the beauty of the building. There were employees who were available for answering questions.

We decided to give it a try, and it was definitely worth it.When you buy online, you have to give an estimated time of arrival. We printed our own tickets at home, and we went through the entrance with very little waiting time.We went through a bag search and scan, then went to the line for the elevator.There were people trying to rent you an ipad, to get better grasp of what you would see on the top, and also you can choose to buy an upper floor ticket that costs extra.We decided it was not worth it and stuck to the cost for the original ticket. We don't regret it. There are also people prssing you to take pictures that will cost you so much more, but they are with bacground photos, not the real thing so we decided to bypass that, since we had our own cameras.The line went quick.mthe elevators are amazing!!To go up 100+ floors in under a minute without feeling the push (just a little pop in the ears as we were going up, but nothing to worry about, just less pressure), and we were greeted at the top with some small and quick documentaris about the construction of the building.Then the drapes or screen opened to reveal a view of NYC and sourroundings!!WOW, that's what I can say about the views.SPECTACULAR views. We stayed there for about two and a half hours enjoying the different views. You can go around the 360\u00b0. Lots of pictures. The windows were sufficiently clean to take great photos, but in some cases the reflection of the inside lights was an unwanted element in the pictures.At on time one side of the tower it was being pounded with rain and the other side was clear, a wonderful spectacle. And because of the hight of the tower and some low clouds, we could se them at level, impressive.No seats to rest if you get tired. You must seat at a slightly higher edge near the windows, but you might get some hight dizziness from being too close to the edge.Things at the gift shop, we found too expensive, but we just didn't feel it was worth to spend many dollars on things that in a few weeks would be stashed in the closet.Great experience, will go again next time I visit NYC"

For every other aspect you are one of the crowd. If you are not tall, your view will be blocked in the elevator because it is packed with people. The presentation is good but if you are up front your too close and if you're not up front your view may be blocked. The Sky view is great but there is a constant flow of people lingering in front of the windows. If you're not in the right place on the elevator ride down you will either be too close to really see what you're looking at or your view is blocked because the elevator is packed with people. Last, I purchase the photography add on. The back drop is a green screen so the fake buildings came through our heads and bodies and the see forever photography employees didn't seem to know what they were doing. When I gave them the prepaid receipt because I purchased it online, they didn't know what it was and ended up not giving me what I purchased. It was so chaotic that ?I didn't realize it until I left."

We were shuttled quickly to a walkway presentation about the Tower, then we walked into a lift and went High, High, High! At the top was a lovely presentation and amazing views! You can't go outside like the World Trade Centre Tower back in the nineties, but it has two floors! And the best time to go is when the sun sets!..Tranquil and romantic, Be wary that the Tower does sway - but not very noticeable! It was daunting to go up at first, as 911 was such as sad day..My thoughts and prayers go out to all. Do the Tower I say!"

As we were walking around looking at the pools before our allocated time we were caught in a sudden thunderstorm. We were soaked but nevertheless turned up for our visit. At the ticket office we were advised that the clouds were so low that there were no views and did we want to postpone our visit. Of course, we accepted. I hesitantly asked whether 11.00 the next morning was available and was told that it would be ok. I was surprised knowing how busy it was likely to be on a Saturday. We were most grateful. The point of this review is to thank the amazing staff for their helpfulness which applies throughout the attraction. The views are, of course, wonderful and we were blessed with a clear, sunny day."

Standing on the top floor of the 5th tallest skyscraper in the world is an experience in itself but the icing on the cake is the interactive graphic presentation shown right before they let you go inside the observation deck. I would have paid the entire entry fees ($32) just to watch that presentation. There were lot of loud \u201cOooooo\u2026..s\u201d and \u201cWows!\u201d from the audience when the presentation ended. Needless to say that the view from the top is amazing. So much so that then and there I called up my family in India and told them where I was. It\u2019s a moment to see the assortment of lights beaming from other skyscrapers and tiny buildings placed neatly on the Cartesian plane of Manhattan Island.I would recommend to visit One World Trade Centre at night for 2 reasons \u2013 no crowd (we had tried coming here in the afternoon but there was an hour long queue to get to the top floor) and the view at night is awe-inspiring. If you are visiting NYC then you might get stuck in deciding which skyscraper to visit \u2013 WTC, Empire State Building or Rockefeller Centre. I am guessing that the view from the top is almost similar in all three of them but WTC would get my vote because of their graphic presentation and the high speed elevator which was so fast that it made our ears pop."

Optimizing the spirit of New York and America, the entire complex is a testament to those who died and shouts out that we will not allow acts of terror to demoralize and defeat the ideals of freedom and democracy that the USA stands for. Well-managed, I secured a timed ticket in advance allowing me to plan my day accordingly. Note, though, that it still took 30 minutes to get to the top even though all was on time. I planned to get there so it was still light and would transition to dark. With that in mind time your ticket for 1 hour prior to sunset, minimum, and you should have more daylight to marvel. And marvel you will at the greatest skyline in the world. Even NJ was awesome. So plan ahead and have a great time!!"

The $15.00 interactive tablet view finder is worth the expense because it identifies most of the interesting buildings you see. The floor panel video special effect thing was pretty lame. I rate it as average because it isn't really anything more than going up real high and looking out over the city.

Once we arrived, they were able to take us a little earlier than our scheduled time so that was a good start. We were warned that visibility was a bit limited and were told we could exchange our tickets for a rain check if we wanted to go up on a cloudless day. We chose to go up. I was VERY nervous about the elevator ride up and last minute, as the elevator doors opened, said I wouldn't go up and my husband could take the kids. Two staff came right over to talk to me. They explained exactly what would happen, asked me what my fears were, and started to talk me down. Then one of the staff a female (I'm so upset I didn't get her name - she was awesome) requested an elevator for me and my family only so that I wouldn't be embarrassed if I started to panic. She rode the elevator with me. Told me she would bring me right back down if I panicked. Once we were at the top, she asked if I needed her to stay with me a bit and made sure I was OK. I was FINE :).Despite the fact that my fears got the best of me, the staff were so kind and caring and went beyond what they needed to do. My fear was completely irrational but they never made me feel like I was being ridiculous. They could have simply let me walk away and I would have missed a great experience with my family. I came down about an hour later to see the same female staff member who gave me a thumbs up and noted that I was even smiling. I'm very thankful to her.Smoothest elevator ride ever.

The clouds were low that morning and the staff at the WTC warned us that viewing would be limited. We weren't there for yet another view, so we continued with the visit. It's a beautiful building inside and out. The elevator to the top (and back down) is a chronological visual journey, that offers a bit of context on the development of NYC. At the top, there is a snack bar, if you really need a cup of coffee while you're there. Seating looked limited, as there were many people standing. That day, I suspect so many people got snacks while waiting for the clouds to burn off--I heard people complaining about the costs. We had the windows to ourselves. Insulated by thick white clouds, we shared a powerful moment; reflecting on the existence of that new building and what it meant. I imagine the view was pretty amazing, too, once the clouds were gone. But we had already returned to the ground and made our way to the reflecting pools. It is definitely worth a visit, regardless of your motivations for visiting."

The views were outstanding , obviously very dependant on weather, we were lucky as it was a clear sunny day. There are 2 observation floors and we were surprised that there was no time limit for the visit and yet there was no problem whatsoever with overcrowding. I guess they track how many elevators have taken visitors up and govern numbers this way. There is a food outlet and an extensive souvenir shop at the top."

Went at 10.30am on a Monday morning and although it was during the UK school holidays it wasn't very busy. Very, very efficient entry process with just a minute or two to wait before getting into the elevator. We spent about an hour and a half admiring the view before settling down for lunch in the restaurant. There is a cafe too which look pleasant but we were keen to sit down to eat and enjoy the view for a little longer. The food and service were great too.Altogether a fantastic experience, I would thoroughly recommend as long as you go on a clear day."

Walked in, paid, walked through the exhibits, got on the elevator and Wowwwwww! The elevators are AMAZING and I wish I could ride them over and over to watch the changing scenes on each wall. Check YouTube for a video of the elevators!When you get off the elevator, you're put into a queue for the \"movie\" they want you to watch. It's scenes of New York and it's a bit overwhelming, but then the wall where they're showing the movie raises up and suddenly you're looking out of the 102nd floor, to the South. Their hashtag #seeforever is so aptly chosen!After that moving experience, you're herded in front of a green screen to have your photo taken, then rushed to stand in front of a counter where the charismatic and engaging young folks try to get you to buy the use of an iPad for $15. After that, you're allowed to wander freely. There is a restaurant, but we didn't eat there.There are also a couple of other exhibits where Ted-talk-esque presentations are going on, but I ignored them.The views are magnificent, especially when you can look straight down and see the south reflecting pool...The gift shop is full of WAY overpriced (even by NYC standards) junk. The cheapest t-shirt is $34, so I bought our traditional \"souvenir\" - a magnet ($8). You can stay as long as you like, and the view is unobstructed from any angle."

The queue staff were all friendly and interactive, seemed to genuinely be having a good time.I don't want to give too much away, but the elevator ride and the presentation immediately at the top were fantastic.There were, of course many opportunities to spend more money (green screen photos, tablet viewing guides, etc) but I didn't feel any of it forced on me.The sky portal was a neat idea, but the screens really weren't projecting in the afternoon light, and hard to see.It got a bit more crowded as we approached the 4:45 sunset, but I still didn't have any trouble snagging some good photos.People have complained that there is nowhere to sit, but I'm not sure why this is an issue. You go up, see what you want, and go back down.Elevator to get back down was a tad hard to find, but all it took was a loop around the core. Maybe a minute wait to get on it then.All in all, well worth it for anyone new to the city or old pros. If you're new, the tablet viewer might be worth it.

It is a must see - agree with others that it is pricey - we did not buy the xpress passes but I did purchase on line for an alloted time. We arrived 15 minutes ahead of time as they recommend but still ended up waiting 1/2 hour to get in. I think alot of people buy the xpress entry pass so they don't have to wait and that screws timing up for others that have \"allloted\" times - I could not swallow the extra $25 just to get in early - although it does get you through security without standing in line. The secutiry line was about 10 minutes long but it moved along quickly. The staff is a pretty well oiled machine. Once you are up there - after a quick little movie - you are in. I rented the ipad which I thought was a waste because it is a tape - not really showing real time and thought was pretty goofy. No seating unless you want to dine. All in all you are paying for a observatory - lot's of people taking pictures and once you see North, South, Each and West - that's it. Visit time depends on how long you want to stand. Hour max and they really don't even give you much information on the building at all. I learned more about the Freedom Building on the cruise around Manhattan."

The opportunity to gaze out on the splendid view we remembered from Windows on the World was worth the price. And yes, the view is still spectacular, but the arduous journey to actually seeing the view is something we certainly didn't expect.Prepare to be herded through a security checkpoint (staffed by incredibly polite, excellent attendants I might add) and then through a darkened hall of video wall presentations, then into a Coney Island-esque recreation of the underpinnings of the building complete with faux bedrock and a concrete pillar made of fiberglass. Then it's off to the elevator ride.The video presentation during the ride is wonderful, though too fast--if you can see over the heads of the other people packed in, that is. You finally arrive at the top... but it will be quite some time before you can actually see the view you came for. More lines, another video wall presentation, and two forced sales pitches to purchase photos of you and your companions superimposed on a background image of NYC--not even the real view mind you--followed by a very long pitch to rent a tablet viewer. Given the dollar's value being what it is these days, international visitors may think nothing of spending $15 for a rental gadget to identify the sights, but when I say \"no thanks\", I don't expect an over-zealous salesperson to argue with me.Finally, through the sales hurdles, you arrive at the observation deck to see what you came for...but only when you can break through the crowds of visitors. There are no benches or seating areas, so prepare for crowds of people jostling for position, some navigating bulky baby strollers, others huddled on the small window ledges taking a rest. Unfortunately, many of the the wondrous views are marred by reflections from the lights of the gift shop, making your photo taking a challenge.New York City's skyline is, and always will be the star of the show, but the One World Observatory experience was simply a profit-centered carnival side show that fails miserably in doing justice to our great City."

Despite the bad reviews, my experience demonstrated a well organised process. There are options to purchase tickets online before arrival, you can also pay extra for express tickets on arrival, to avoid the lines. We had neither for our tour, and probably waited 30 minutes to get to the viewing platform at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. Some Tips: There is an additional $15 dollar charge per iPad, which allows to use an app that's helps you identify exactly which buildings your looking at from the viewing platform. Worth every cent. When you enter the elevator, turn and face the glass, as the lifts close the glass around you becomes digital screens, get your cameras ready to video. There is a self service cafe at the top, that serves the basics, but behind that is a restaurant & cocktail bar. To dine in the restaurant you would need to book in advance of your tour ticket. The cocktail bar is roped off, which makes it appear that it's a VIP area. It's not, anyone can have a drink at the bar, drinks are pricey, but they do taste sweeter whilst you take in the spectacular views, it's worth paying out for at least one! In total we spent around 2hrs 30 mins at the One World Observatory."

We had our lunch in the restaurant and the food was tasty & not as expensive as we thought it would be. You could spend an entire day at the top of this beautifully designed building, which overlooks the Ground Zero footprint waterfall memorial gardens, on returning to the ground floor you again get an amazing experience on the elevator down. You can then visit the Ground Zero Memorial, while there just take a look back up to the top of the WTC to get a feel for how high up you've just been. Above all enjoy the whole experience."

No, I was not there on THAT day, but I was there in the aftermath and watched for months the ruins of the towers no longer there and thought about the people I knew who were no longer there\u2026 As result, it took me fourteen years to be able to bring myself back to the site. For all these years, every time I find myself in the area, I would do my best to avoid approaching the site, still remembering the messages and photos posted all along Broadway: people looking for other people, relatives, friends, anybody, anything.  To make a long story short, I finally decided to approach on a recent Friday. That\u2019s when I found that there was no more lobby you can walk in and shop and browse, entrance to the new WTC 1 is highly secured and the Path train has nothing but scurrying crowds of commuters. But then, they had built the Observation Deck and I decided to visit. The line for tickets was very short (5 minutes or so). Cost $32/person or $54 \u201cPriority\u201d which will allow you a quicker admission. I am sure there are days when it pays to go Priority. You buy your tickets, go through Security and after another short wait at the elevators (spectacular!) you are up for orientation. The elevators in the old building were different: they went very fast, then pushed the \u201cbrakes\u201d and slowed for getting off. To get to the 96th Floor I had to change two elevators. Not these beauties: they use some new technology which flawlessly and gracefully took us to the 102th floor and we did not even feel the elevation. The first level is orientation where there is a short video presentation (I found it un-watchable, the huge screen is too close for comfort and the content is of very limited interest). After some more peddling (an old Yankee tradition) when they try to sell you photos and rent you tablets, you are finally let loose to circle the glass windows and enjoy/photograph the most fabulous views in our great City. Neither the Rockefeller Center (separate review) nor the Empire State Building (separate review) come close to what you can see from here. I cannot help it but think about the people who came to work in Windows on the World (the restaurant on top) on that fatal 9/11 not knowing that this is the last day they\u2019d be seeing those views\u2026 or seeing anything, period.  The glass windows are reasonably clean, so you can take pictures quite comfortably, I cannot describe the views for you, you\u2019ll have to see them to believe them. The \u201cEye\u201d dares you to step on a transparent panel where you can see the cars moving down on the street... I look at the couples all around and think of all the images I saw after 9/11 of couples holding hands while jumping from atop one of the Towers, preferring this to death from burning... A couple of digital presentation panels each with a human interpreter, covering different boroughs/features/sites of NYC and a gift shop complete your visit. Oh, and if you are hungry, there is a restaurant, I did not go there. No appetite. On the way down I realize that this enterprise provides employment to a large number of people in positions that do not need extensive training.  For movie lovers: a variety of movies were shot in the old WTC:Three days of the Condor , Rollover, Trading Places, Escape from New York etc., but my preferred one is Dino de Laurentis\u2019 King Kong (1976) in which the WTC (new and sexy) won over the Empire State Building for shooting location. The Empire State Building, quite annoyed by this, staged people dressed like apes to demonstrate around the WTC. Getting King Kong from Hollywood to the WTC was another story: the monster model was dismantled to pieces, loaded in special trucks with KING KONG painted on their sides and transported to NYC while press releases kept the public informed of the important event\u20265,000 extras were needed and the production company invited the public to the WTC Plaza on the nights of June 21-22-23, 1976. Thousands of New Yorkers showed up and King Kong got its crowd scenes: for three days the Great Ape was the city\u2019s brightest star. Jessica Lange was almost lost in its shadow. Yep, that\u2019s how she started. The new WTC 1 is not on the site of the original tower, that one is reserved for the Memorial park & Museum. My bravery did not extend to visiting those. I find it very bad taste to make money from those tragic days and events."

I would have liked to see more of this type of information throughout the visit. We found it too commercialised, and almost forgot the reason why it is there and was built. The views are fantastic, but unlike the Empire State Building, there is no external observation deck so all our photos had reflections from the glass. There is a presentation first but there was no information, just random videos of a typical day in NY, people skateboarding, having a coffee etc. Then we were asked to attend another \u201cpresentation\u201d, which we thought would give us some information in relation to the tower, but this was to try to sell us renting of Ipads for information whist on the observation deck, which was very disappointing. There was a coffee shop, souvenir shop and info points on the observation deck, again commercialised and no one to actually ask any questions to regarding the building. I do not want to sound disrespectful but if you are looking to view NY from a high level I would choose the Empire State Building over Freedom Tower every time. And again would like to say this is in regards to the Tower only and not direct surrounding areas. Very disappointed and come away from the tower with knowing nothing more but a see a nice view."

The digital video screens around the experience are amazing and make the transition to the view much easier (I was slightly panicked at the height beforehand!). Definitely recommend this and it's the same price as the Empire State Building or Rockefeller but we had no wait at all - a huge relief!"

Which again for the price there should be. Loved the views, they could just try a bit harder giving people value for money, rather than the hard sell which includes the vast shop and resturant"

The lead up in elevator and the NYC movie before the curtain goes up are all high quality, and- knowing the drill- I had my video aimed at the family members for their reactions when seeing the view for the first time.

They then try to sell you lots of extras 'to enhance your visit'. Firstly the loan of an iPad for $15 to zoom in on whatever building you are looking at. The cafe and restaurant are grossly overpriced as is the merchandise in the shop. On exiting they try to get another $25 for a photo they take of you on entry, with a superimposed cheesy backdrop of the tower. They don't say why they are taking the photo, only that they have to take a photo of everyone, so it could be for security. No information at all on the design or construction of the building, or even who the architect was.Tip. Go early, before 10am. Easy to book a timed ticket on line for the same day and no queues."

I've been there in the spring and the fall, on a sunny day and a cloudy day; I want to go back at night and at sunrise. There are some very unique experiences to enjoy. I have been to the observation deck of the Burj Kalifa in Dubai, a building twice as high as this; however, the view of lower Manhattan, the lower Hudson River, the New Jersey gentrified area, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Staten Island, Brooklyn and the East River, Brooklyn Bridge, is unparalleled. You can see the United Nations, Empire State and other building landmarks. It was more impressive (perhaps because I'm American) than to me than the Burj Kalifa. I recommend anyone who goes to New York to experience the One World Observation deck. Buy your tickets online, pick the day and time, early is better but in New York, its often cloudy until later in the afternoon. The ride up the elevator is in itself, incredible because to the century long time-lapse video image of the development of Manhattan, and there are other surprising multi-media presentations, I won't \"spoil\" it for you, go and be surprised yourself. The restaurant is great, the caf\u00e9 is amazing, delicious, top quality. Expect to pay more than elsewhere, but I was very happy to pay more, have great food and drink, while looking over the city. This is no Dallas Tower, or Toronto, nor Space Needle, this is more, totally breathtaking. I've only been there twice, but I expect to return again and again.I want to add one more detail. They will rent to you a tablet kind of gadget that is amazing. You point it out the window, it will identify the buildings and landmarks you see around the 360 degree view. That's not all, you tap the screen on some object which is identified, such as Coney Island. Within seconds you visually \"fly\" to that location, maybe at three times the speed of sound, then land right at the spot. Its much more than Google Street view. Actually, as an engineer, I'm still trying to figure out how it works. It is worth the $15.00 USD."

The afternoon we visited the queue was quite short and we were able to gain entry in no more than half an hour, once you get through security, you enter a tunnel, which takes you through solid rock, you then realise that these are the foundations the Observatory is built on, lots of Manhattan is solid rock. The lift is one of those super duper ones that makes your ears pop and you arrive on the 102nd floor, before your tummy has left the basement! Adults are charged $32. Seniors $30 not sure about children as we had none in our party. The Lift doors open and you enter what I can only call a \"waiting area\", I believe there may be 2 or 3 Lifts, within seconds the waiting area is full of people, the blank wall in front of you puts on a movie show with voice over, all to do with New York, this does not last for more than 3 minutes or so, then the wall lifts, there were simultaneous gasps and clapping from the people watching ( I won't spoil the surprise) you are then taken to another area for a quick chat and a sales opportunity, from there you go down a floor to a 360 degree observation deck and gift shop. As you would expect beautiful views over the 9/11 Memorial,there is also the new building structure which is being erected across the road, which to me looks like a bird in flight with its wings extended, I believe this will be a beautiful thing when its finished. When you come down in the lift you again have a very brief visual tour of new York by way of cinema and a voice over, all in all a great experience. If you visit here, you may not want to visit the iconic Empire State, as once you have seen New York from the 102nd Floor of one building it all looks the same but from another angle!"

You can buy your tickets on line before you arrive. You select a date and time of arrival. By coming early you avoid all the lines and crowds. Our ticket time was for 10:00am on a Thursday. When we arrived we just walked up to the front entrance and showed our tickets, no line, no waiting !! :-) We were directed to the entrance/display area where you see the bedrock of the building and a display of monitors with videos of the workers who built the tower. Once you get on the elevator, you see the most wonderful video displayed on the whole interior wall of the elevator. Amazing!! Once you arrive on the 102 floor, you are directed to an area, where you see another video with many NY vistas. I will not tell you what happens when the video is over. All I can say is WOW!!! Again, go early, because you seem to have the whole floor to yourself, and no one is blocking your view. By the time we were finished looking at all the sights, it was about 11:00am and the place was becoming very crowded. The earlier the better!!!"

However, it's indoors, it's crowded, and you better be prepared to queue, queue, and queue some more!There are plenty of negative reviews around visibility, but my biggest issue is the queue to leave the place. Simply do the math:1) You book a 15 minute time slot to enter the observatory.2) You spend more than 15 minutes in the observatory.Assuming a constant influx of people, this means that there will always be an overlap of people in the observatory. As such, the queue to leave the place is simply insane. It nearly wrapped around the *entire* observatory, meaning that it would take at least one hour to exit. This is not acceptable, and poor logistics.That said, the view is amazing. It's indoors only, refreshment prices are extortionate, and it has airport-esque security. Top of the Rock is probably better."

Having been to the top of the original twin towers, it was hard. A reminder of what once was and is no longer because of an act of terror. That said, there is an amazing video that you watch during your elevator ride and up and down. Great technology and graphic. The price is quite high, but we felt the need to go"

The lines were very very long. My suggestion is that if you are planning to visit the observatory buy your tickets online. If you do not, this will simply add yet another line that you must wait in. Once you have tickets, either bought online or you waited in the \"purcahse tickets\" line at the observatory itself, pay attention to your scheduled tour time and I suggest not arriving any earlier than the scheduled 15 minute window for arrival. Example, your your starts at 3:30, you may enter the first line at 3:15. No earlier. Once through this line you will then be herded to a security line. Somewhat like the TSA lines at the airport. After this line you enter into another waiting area except this area, which is another line, has stuff for you to watch and things to look at and read. Upon making your way through all the lines the experience begins with the elevator ride. Wow! What an experience. When you get off the elevator you will be corralled into a holding area to watch a video. If you are short like I, try to get up front otherwise you won't see anything. I'm not trying to be ugly but there was a guy on crutches, not in a cast or a boot, no visible injury, he was just walking with crutches and he was a tall guy. The lady herding people called him out and put him and his party up front. Well he ended up in front of me with severa of his friends. I saw nothing during this part of the tour. I'm 5'2 and this guy was probably 6'2. He could have stood in the back of the room and been just fine. Anyway, after the short film is over the screen raises really fast and you get your first glimpse at the view of the city. You can briefly enjoy the view as people exit this room. From here you are moved into another area where you may pick up and iPad if you paid for one. This iPad will adjust to your position within the observatory and will point out what buildings you may be looking at as well as other points of interest. Its kinda a neat little extra. This views from up here are amazing and if you have yet to see the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island, well you can see them from here. While the views are incredible I believe this is one of those things I would probably only pay to do once. Unless I'm visiting the city with someone who's never been up in the observatory before."

The employees here are way uptight. They're so uptight that they ruined the experience and the \"moment.\" They're just there to herd people. No smiles, not polite but not rude either. It's very sterile. The most annoying thing is that they pack you in like sardines for everything. Especially to try to sell you the I-pad experience. Most places just let you walk to the floor of the observatory and let you explore. Here, you feel like they are holding you upside down and shaking every penny out of your pocket before you can go to that floor. The most impressive was the elevator ride. Hopefully someone from management reads this and things change. Take a class at \"Disney\" and let people feel the moment!"

After asking, we found we could just buy tickets and go up. The tickets are a little pricey at $32 but we went because we did not have to wait.You walk through a bit of an underground display before getting to the elevators. We had perhaps a 5 minute wait to get onboard, and the attendant says make sure to look out the elevator. What happens in the minute or so it takes to go up is you see how Manhattan developed from green forests to concrete towers....it was very cool. I wanted to go down and up again just to watch it.They show you a tablet when you get to the top that you can hold up and it instantly points out all of the landmarks you see with more details available with a click. I thought the tablet would be free....a great tool and deal. But there was a charge and most people did not go for it. We picked on up and it was fun for a bit, but I soon found the tablet always showed the south view no matter which direction I held it. Perhaps worth the money....hard to say.The views were great. Liberty Island one way and all of Manhattan the other. Unfortunately with the Ground Zero memorial right at the base of the building it is hard to get a good look at it from above.The elevator ride down had a different display on the windows....equally fun to watch but different than going up. Always try to be on the outside of the elevator when you board.The WTC area is about a 10 minute walk from the nearest subway station. There was a lot of construction in the area so it was not always obvious the best way to walk."

Suffice to say it definitely didn't disappoint; not only are the views spectacular and largely unobstructed (we were especially lucky with a deep-red sunset over New Jersey) but the observatory itself is aesthetically well designed, with a restaurant, cafe and pleasant mood lighting. The elevator to the top includes a projected animation detailing a time-lapse of the city over the last 1000 years or so, followed by a dramatic reveal of the view over the city. The guides are are polite and helpful (though the info iPad describing the landmarks of the city is pretty overpriced at $15). Just like the 9/11 memorial, I would thoroughly recommend this for any trip to New York and would definitely recommend that people do it in conjunction with the museum and memorial below."

What's so great about being up high and looking down? We've already been to the top of the Empire State Building and the Top of the Rock, after all. But I went ahead and purchased the tickets online for the following day, choosing the Twilight Flex option, which allowed us to enter (without standing in line!) any time from 4-7pm. It cost more, but we were hedging our bets, as we weren't sure what time we could get there. And are we glad we did! In the end, we arrived just before 4pm, and found the many entrance points/lines confusing and not so well marked. But we asked an employee, who looked at our tickets and immediately shepherded us right to the front door, bypassing the whole scene outside. From that point, all along the way, employees helpfully greeted and guided us. The elevator ride up was very cool, less than one minute in length, and featuring a display on the evolution of NYC. Upon reaching the upper levels, we enjoyed the dramatic \"big reveal\" of the view. We spent about 1 1/2 hours circling the viewing area, as my husband took photos of the city from every angle. He was in his glory, and I found it surprisingly entertaining as well. Besides the incredible views, I enjoyed checking out the plentiful gift shop area, watched a wedding in progress, met some nice tourists, and listened to a very funny tour guide/comedian give a spiel about NYC. The only disappointment was the food situation. We had planned to eat at the cafe, but changed our minds when we discovered that there was no seating around the tables--everyone was standing. We looked at the menu for the upscale restaurant option, but it didn't interest us. After leaving the observatory, we ended up at a neighborhood sports bar for supper, but we would have happily paid the inflated prices for food at One World Observatory if there had been seating and an attractive menu. All in all, it was great fun, and the staff is particularly friendly and welcoming. If you enjoy heights, I would definitely recommend a trip to the top."

We entered One World Trade after a very poignant visit to the 9/11 Museum and Memorial. I am grateful for paying the extra for the Priority tickets, because we avoided very long lines in doing so. We were able to go right to the express elevator to the top. The elevator ride was by far the coolest I have ever experienced. We exited the elevator into a dark room and were treated to a multi sensory experience that culminated in a quick view of the surrounding area. This was very nice. The only drawback to the visit was a choke point sales presentation of an overpriced iPad rental to show landmarks around the region. For people who wanted to use it, I think this was fine, but it was impossible to proceed to the restaurant or the observation deck on the levels below because of all the people waiting for the sales pitch to finish. I hope this is re-thought by the management. I understand the need for generating revenue, but by then, I had already paid enough. We ate at the restaurant which I will review later, and then proceeded to the observation deck to explore The region from such a great vantage point. From views of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge to the full length of Manhattan, the sites were spectacular. There were lots of selections in the gift shop as well. We then queued up for the trip down in the fantastic elevator, and exited the building. Overall, it was a fantastic experience if you are willing and able to pay the price of admission."

Rain might not be such a good thing.The introduction to the observatory is terrific - one is surrounded by the granite that allows New York's skyscrapers. Even better is the elevator ride to the top - and grounded in historical views (i.e., at the beginning is the city as it looked before humans built their structures). As you quickly rise, you see the city unfolding over the last couple of hundred years. I wish there were a way to purchase this timeline - a great way to appreciate our quest for domination over nature in our structures.The view is just beautiful - you can rent a tablet that allows you to identify the buildings at your feet. We bypassed that - my husband is from NYC so I had a personal guide to do the IDing for me.If you don't know the city, it can be overwhelming at first, but you can take in the panoramic view as long as you want."

We had a mindset of enjoying good panoramic views while learning more about the WTC history and acquiring Good knowledge of the previous and current building in our recent trip to this place. Overall, There weren't much useful information for charging usd 32 per person plus furthermore you were asked to rent an iPad for additional usd15 to learn slightly more about the key buildings from the device. It's the tallest building in NYC and yes, period. You could see Brooklyn/Manhattan bridge and downtown pretty clearly but I would recommend go to Empire State Building or Rock. Center if you are seeking a mid town /more concrete jungle view. Overall an expensive and disappointing experience."

But they do entertain you along the wait, with very good videos and large screens with some inspiring clips. The elevator ride is very cool. I am usually a bit queezie with simulators but this was fine for me, it's very quick. The 'reveal' is cool, but we did get a bit frustrated with being constantly hearded along and just wanted to get to the observatory. Which once there was truly spectacular. You can linger as long as you want once up there and take your time to take in the views from all angles. Well worth the ticket price in my opinion."

I just wanted to look out the window, but first you have to sit through a movie with a big reveal at the end, listen to a big spiel where they try to rent you iPads for $15, get your photo taken, etc. You're all taken up as a group. It's kind of annoying, throughout this whole process the windows are all covered/screened. Then you go by the restaurant, then you're led down to the viewing platform. The view is amazing. However, the interior design of the building is very white and light colored which means the windows have terrible glare. It was difficult to take a picture without getting the reflection of my shirt in it. Most places I've gone up to have dark interiors that discourage glare. The best windows (directly north, for example) have little stands in front of them with a multimedia display and you're not allowed to go look out of those windows directly. The view was amazing. However, all the other stuff involved was a hassle. It was expensive and I'd recommend Top of the Rock instead."

Impressive elevator ride with none of the usual OMG feelings in an elevator that goes that high that fast. The graphics in the elevator provide a distraction, but they are not very good. Once off the elevator, you are subjected to at least 10 minutes of photo taking and product hawking that is VERY annoying. If you charge me $32 to enter, give me the tools you have available to make it enjoyable. There is no denying that the view is unbelievable, but the crowd management (or lack thereof) is so overwhelming that you just want to leave. Management needs to have staff spend more time pulling teenagers editing 1200 photos of the same view away from the windows, instead of having staff hawking tacky photos of fake backgrounds. If you go, please remember: Do your social media somewhere else, not while sitting in the window box blocking other people from enjoying the attraction. Very disappointing attraction. Attraction managment need to work harder at making the actual attraction better for all attendees by reducing the sales events at the beginning and providing much needed crowd control around the windows."

The views on a clear day are absolutely terrific. You can see all of NYC from Midtown to Downtown, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island, New Jersey, the Hudson and East Rivers. it is really amazing. My recommendation is to get your tickets online ahead of time, so all you have to do is show up 15 minutes before you designated time and get in line. there are specific lines set up, about four of them, which are separated out by times. You show up and tell them what time you have and they direct you to that line. You really don't wait too long to get in the building.You will have to go through an airport type security line with whole body scanners and xray machines. The elevator ride up is amazing. The inside walls of the elevator are actually full height monitors. While you are riding up, they display NYC starting back from the early 1900s and show you how all the buildings came to be over the years. It is really cool. The ride takes probably less than a minute to get up to the top. Once there, you start on the 103 floor and work your way down. They try to sell you this pitch about something. We just passed by without stopping and went down to the 102nd floor. There is a restaurant. You head down to the 101st floor to get to the views. They are amazing. The floor is very crowded, so getting up to the glass may take a few minutes, but be patient and you will get the view you want. The cost was around $26/person, with some discounts for seniors and children. A bit pricey for a few minutes of looking out the window, but I would still recommend if you like this kind of thing."

I hope it's not raining, snowing or there is too much fog. It's better to check the weather forecast first. Maybe buy only a day ahead of your visit. If you buy the ticket on your cell phone they can scan your cell phone and no need to print it out. There are multiple tiers of tickets. You can risk trying to get a same day ticket. Trying to get a Friday-Sunday ticket is of course your highest risk. Tickets are $32 per person.The entrance is located on west street. It's here that you show your ticket. You could try to purchase your ticket on your cell phone while waiting in line. Next you are herded downstairs to a security checkpoint. It's a full body scan. You do not have to take your shoes off. No food or drinks and like airport security no liquids. From here you go down a hallway lined with bedrock. At the end of the hallway you are again herded into one of many elevators for the trip up.The elevator ride is quick. and needs to be because there are 104 stories. The observation deck is on the 192 floor. I've been to the Pearl Tower in Shanghai, China and in both cases my ears popped and I could not really feel the speed. The sides of the elevator are LCD screens and as you go up the history of NYC is told. The city rises up as you go up. It's spectacular.Once on top you are in a long hall and lined up behind a giant screen. A short video gives you information about NYC, how many visitors and where they came from.. The screen lifts and you are presented with a spectacular view. Pictures do not do justice to the view. It has to be seen. The observation deck is all enclosed behind glass. No outside observation deck. It's a 360 view as you walk in a circle. lots of glare and reflection but you can find free areas. The sun side is really difficult for photos. My suggestion is that 1 hour before sunset is an ideal time to go preferably Mon-Thursday. Since you can stay on top as long as you want, you get day and night pictures. There are bathrooms, a few seats to sit and rest, gift shop and a restaurant directly below. The restaurant sells hot dogs for $7 and beer for $12. This should give you an idea about meal prices. They also have a Sky Portal. On the elevator down a different video is shown in the elevator. In the 16 acre World Trade Center site you have the two twin tower fountains, 9/11 memorial museum and One World Trade Center with the observation deck. You can find a virtual tour online."

It was breathtaking , brought tears to our eyes when we looked out for the first time from the 102nd floor over the city,it was totally amazing . The weather was beautiful while we were there and it was spectacular . A memory we will carry with us forever , and to walk around the memorial and read all the names of all the people who lost their lives there . Very sad , but a beautiful memorial in their honour . A must see for everyone who visits N.Y."

So to begin with- let's talk ticket levels- having been at the top of the Empire State Building at Sunset I thought just how beautiful it would be to experience this building at the most beautiful time of day. For $20 more you can get a \"sunset flex\" ticket, or you can just do the smart thing and consult a farmer's almanac to find out when sunset will be- this quick google will save you money. It was my boyfriend's first trip to NYC and he was particularly looking forward to this experience for photography alone. The way the gift shop is placed in the center of the observation decks, the closer it gets to night time and beyond, it just reflects in the windows... all my photos have floating merch above the Manhattan view- just what you would want right? Moreover, as others have said, there is NO WHERE to sit and because of this people tend to sit on the ledge of the windows- no one polices this so people who aren't even looking out the window are just hogging up what little space there is to look out. It was just so so so disappointing. The \"See Forever Theater\" is a joke.... seriously we were laughing at how pointless and bad it was. There was so much potential and it was all ruined by a gift shop and not hiring enough staff. It's a waste of everyone's time and money. You're better off going to ESB by far.... I mean unless you want floating exit signs and tshirts in all your photos...."

Because of the significance of this building, the outstanding 360 degree views (up to ~40 miles on the clearest of days), the clean and comfortable observation area, and very friendly staff, it would be hard to give this attraction anything but an excellent rating (even for the $32 per adult ticket, which does seem a little steep). In contrast, the Empire State Building -- while iconic and historic -- is not as clean and comfortable, the visit is more rushed and \"mechanical\", there is sometimes pressure to buy unneeded add-ons to tickets, the views (to me) are not as nice, and the observation area is considerably smaller (although outside, whereas One World is all inside). If you only can do one of these two, my vote is strongly in favor of One World Observatory."

Once on top of the world, there are two decks for observation, snack bar, restaurant, gift shop and you can spend as much time as you wish. Allow 30 minutes for a great experience. For $15 you can rent a locator iPod that shows you NYC landmarks. $32 admission is worth it and then you can walk over to the Memorial afterwards. We went on a Saturday morning and it was not busy.

Not long enough to take in the Manhattan timeline which is flashed on the walls of the elevator. I would love to have more time to study the depiction of the growth of Manhattan Island. Otherwise, the viewing at the top was magnificent. Those familiar with New York City will enjoy identifying the different sites. The Empire State Building is a stick out as are the bridges connecting Manhattan with the boroughs. We were even able to focus on our cruise ship docked in the Hudson River. The Statue of Liberty is easy to spot as are the ferries shuffling back and forth to and from Staten Island. Tours are available, but the signs and tablets posted are a wealth of information.

It's an experience like no other. It's unlike any other high-rise observation deck experience and it's a testament to human ingenuity. The best way to describe it is that the view from here is like the breathtaking view from a place without having to worry about losing it when the plane files past it. No other view from a skyscraper in the city allows you to go right up to the glass and look down. It's truly something to experience, even if the cost will set you back quite a bit."

First, we booked tickets for 1:30, and arrived a few minutes early. Then, we stood in line. Finally got to go inside around 1:50. So, 20 minutes standing outside isn't bad, but it might be in January! So, they were a little behind, but not terrible. Short lines for security and the elevators - those were not a problem at all. Then they get you to the top. You wait while other groups to arrive, then they put you all in this room where you see a video presentation, and then SURPRISE! The video screens lift up and there's the view! Except then they go back down about 15 seconds later. JK on the awesome view, guys! Then they herd you all into another room. In this room, they try to get you to pay MORE for an iPad thing that can tell you what the buildings you're looking at. The kicker is that in this room, the windows are covered. As in, you COULD have the view, but they don't want you to be distracted while they sell you stuff, so they cover them. Finally you are allowed to take an escalator down to the observatory, but by that time we had such a bad taste in our mouths from all the blatant money-grubbing that it was hard to shake off at first. Oh, and don't worry. There's a cafe and gift shop up there, too. In case you'd like to spend more money...So, yes. The views are awesome. But given that you're already paying a bunch of money for the privilege of looking through the windows, it's really annoying how long it takes you to get a chance to do just that."

Because my time was somewhat limited, I took an express ticket (cost is about double, approx 54 US) which takes you to the observatory deck in a few minutes.The elevator is great not only because of its stunning speed but also because it projects the scenery of Manhattan on the walls showing the development during the past four centuries. Once out of the elevator you first have to see a short audiovisual show which is pretty good and then the curtains (literally) are raised and you get a glimpse of the view. Great you would think, but then you are led to a photo shoot (which you can skip), some more explanation, while all the windows are sealed. If you want to move on to the observatory deck you have to walk directly to the escalator one floor down to finally enjoy the views. Quite busy with people trying to take dozens of selfies while blocking the views. But OK, be patient and enjoy the moment. Surely worth the visit!"

I don't care about the videos, the shops, the photo-guys, the coffe places.... A terrace for really engaging the city would be enough.

There was practically no queue either outside or inside the building, so we were up in the sky in under 10 minutes.The one downside is that because the OWO is deep downtown, your view of Central Park and other NYC green space is of course blocked by the skyscrapers of midtown/Times Square. For a better view of ALL of Manhattan, you'd need to consider the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock instead.Well worth the money, considering you can hang around for as long as you want, once you're up at the top."

But, after the lines (buy your tickets in advance) and the astonishingly quick elevator ride (complete with historical graphics showing the city's development) you might recall that you are hungry, or thirsty. If that's the case, visit the restaurant. Good beer, great snacks in a relaxed but grown up atmosphere. Service was helpful and timely, the food was very good (we had lighter plates) and the view is unmatched. More than worth a visit and a very pleasant interlude during your sight seeing day."

Not sure I would have gone otherwise since I used to work at World Trade Center and have seen the views many times, but the place is too painful to visit on my own. I must say it is much improved from the original structure although the view is the same. However, the elevator ride is so much better! No more popping of the ears. They show you the progression and development of the area on a screen as you climb the 100 floors in a quick 60 seconds. Don't look at your phone or talk to your neighbor or you may miss the entire show. Then as you reach the top, they lift the screen to see the entire real view. Very dramatic. FYI, they do not show you the same view on the way down. The coffee shop is very expensive, $6 for a cappuccino, but a nice place to enjoy the view away from the crowds. Make sure you walk around the 360 room. I actually did not make it all the way around as I got stuck in the NJ views. Also better to go up on a nice day. We had awesome weather and visibility was more than 20 miles!"

This new observatory is slick and new and has the views but I don't think it was very well thought out. All of the Windows have ledges that have slats that appear to be vents and people sit and stand on them. If they are vents, won't debris from their shoes fall in there?

But I'm giving it a positive rating because of how well everything in the observatory was done:- Walking through the \"faux\" bedrock- The elevator giving you a visual as you rise to the top- The personalization of all the individuals that worked on the building- And the quality of the view itself (you truly can see all of NYC, the boroughs, and beyond)To me, it seems a bit pricey for what it is, but if you enjoy this kind of thing, you'll love it!"

However, the rest of the visit is a little on the disappointing side.I would strongly recommend anyone to buy the Expedited package, it may be an additional $20 per person but the lines can be horrendous trying to get in to the building, then again through security and then to the lifts. The expedited packages let you bypass all of the lines and get straight on the next lift.The lift itself is brilliant, showing the story of NYC changing over the past centuries until you get to the summit and the present day, it is very smooth and you don't even feel like you are moving (very much/fast).At When at the top there is the typical hard sell of the panoramic video devices, and etc, before you get into the observatory, but this can be bypassed. I do think that at $54 a ticket that this should be included. The bars and restaurants at the top are also a little pricey - $5 for a (cold) drip coffee is extortionate. We did try to visit the bar for a hard drink but were told that it was by reservation only that day - nice to be made aware. There is the obligatory gift shop with over priced stuff on sale. The staff on the observatory floor are very helpful, showing you lots of hidden stories and gems of Manhattan, the rest of NYC and Jersey However the really poor part was the time that it took us to get down, almost an hour spent in line waiting for the lifts to take us down - mainly due to the shear number of people and a lack of direction from staff.In all it was a fantastic experience, especially as we visited at sunset, so got to see day, dusk and evening, and pretty good value on the whole."

What an amazing introduction to this magnificent & proud city. I cried when the windows opened at the top. Great little lift ride to the top then a great little presentation & a dramatic reveal of the view we were about to see. Moving & dramatic. If u visit one tower while you're in the city, make sure it's this one. The best experience ever with views to really write home about!"

First, it's brand new and shiny and It has the latest technology. The 60 second elevator ride up is a giant led TV that shows a cool movie about how the landscape has changed over the last 100 years. Yep. All that in 60 seconds. And that's just the ride up. The entire elevator is the tv screen. It's awesome. You arrive quickly at the top and have a few minutes of an annoying sales presentation on their $15 iPad upgrade. It didn't last long. My advice: decide ahead of time if you want to rent their iPad for $15 and grab it, if not, move on to the view. The view is awesome!! You feel like you can \"see forever\". It was a clear day. We could see citi field all the way in flushing! The Empire State Building is gorgeous. It's nice to see the island and you can really begin to appreciate the number of tall structures and bridges. The only thing you really cannot see is Central Park. There are too many tall buildings. If that is important to you, then pick top of the rock. This is the best Ariel view of lady liberty (unless you did a helicopter and got a little closer). There is a \"city portal\" where you can see the street below in real-time. It looks like a glass window, but it is really more LED TVs with a real-time camera. Impressive everything. Even the ride down in the elevator was exhilarating."

With that said they did a marvelous job recreating the old 107 floor observatory. The entire staff working there was super friendly. Like Disney word friendly, something you just don't see in NY. The experience builds you up for the view and has really intense technology in the elevator and on the floor to add to the experience. The drawbacks are timed entry and crowds. The timed entry is annoying since you have to commit an exact time when you are coming and even with that its still pretty darn crowded when trying to get to a window to look at. We allotted 1h 15 mins which was not enough time if you wanted to casually look around because you burn through almost 30 mins going up and down waiting in lines.

            "review": "An Over-produced Experience. The problem with the new One World Observatory is that it is way over-produced. First, they made everyone wait outside before entering the building...on the day I went it was very windy and probably 45degF outside...very cold to be making people wait outside. Once we finally got inside, there was lots of open space inside where people could have been allowed to wait...not sure why they make everyone wait outside. Once you finally get inside and get through security, you start off in the basement of the building in a tunnel whose walls are fake rock (seriously...if you tap them they sound hollow), and that's supposed to illustrate how the foundation of the building has been securely built into the ground. Then, you take an elevator up to the top. The elevator has no views. Instead, its walls have an elaborate illustrated depiction that show visually how the city of new York has changed from its founding in the 1600's to present day. Kind of cool, but frankly unnecessary if you just paid $32 cause you were only interested in seeing the view at the top. Then, once you get to the top, they make you stand in front of a large wall onto which they project a movie that shows a lot of views of people and places in the city...it's pretty much just like some montage that an NYU film student probably made. Then, the wall onto which movie was projected actually lifts up and exposes the view. But, you still can't take it in. Instead, you are ushered into a room next door where they give you a sales pitch to rent for $15 a tablet that you can point at any building in the city and it will tell you what that building is. Then, you are forced to take a photograph with the people in your party so that they can try to sell it to you as you leave. After all that is done, then finally you can take time to walk around the windows and enjoy the view. It's a lot to go through if really you just wanted to be able to take a few photos from the top. I've been to the Sears Tower in Chicago, and it's a much simpler and enjoyable experience: buy your tickets, take the elevator to the top, get off and take pictures of the view. Enough said."

We visited on Saturday night around 6pm and although we purchased tickets on-line, there were only about 20 people on line waiting for tickets. Yes, the elevator is unique in that full wall screens on 3 sides replicate the view as you ascend the building. And you are taken into a room where there is a short multimedia display about New York before the screens are lifted to show the real view of New York through the windows. The views are incredible from the 100th floor, where you can see from all sides of the building. The problem is that people sit at the bottom of the window sill and it's a little awkward to take photos with people sitting below you. The other thing is that there is glare in the photos from the interior lights. My wife and I like taking photos so this was a disappointment. We stayed until they kicked us out at 8pm, but around 7:45pm, most of the people left and you can get a window pane for yourself and take photos. You can get good photos of the view but it's tough get one with someone in the photo due to the glare. Not like the Top of the Rock, where you can go outside and get great photos without glare. If you must choose between the Empire State Building, the Top of the Rock and here, I would suggest choosing between those two."

I watched the building of the original Twin Towers and watched the horror of 9/11. We have been to the Reflection Pools and the Museum. This is a different experience. In some ways almost Disney-esque. The tribute that the individuals that actually worked on the project to rebuild gave is profound for many other reasons. The trip in the elevator going up and the mystery of what is behind the glass and the presentation is a bit suspenseful and entertaining. Once they raise the window coverings and you experience the 360 degree views, you stop in your tracks. We bought timed tickets for 5 PM so that we could witness the 6:13 PM sunset on October 16h, so it is wise to do your homework if you want that experience. It was crowded, but not so much that you can't walk around and get good photos. You do have to be patient and wait to get close enough to the windows for the optimal view. It is worth it. The merchandising is what does not appeal to me. The taking of your picture when you enter the zone so that they can ultimately try to sell you a picture as you exit at street level is a bit hokey. There is food, but not a very large area or a big assortment. The Gift Shop is precariously located in the middle of the Observation area and can get congested. And the things I looked at were extremely expensive. They do have devices to rent that are pretty cool if you want explanations of what you are looking at. And there is very knowledgeable personnel to help with questions and explanations of what you can see from this high up, but they are fielding a lot of questions, so don't count on them for long.Overall, I look forward to a return trip."

Everything was smooth, tickets and the trip to the top. At the top, I expected a lot more info (Yes, there were paid ipads to rent, but wasn't too keen). There were a couple of interactive demos/news, but the wait was long. One big dissapointment was the fully-walled experience. Having been to the rock a few years ago, I was hoping there will be some element of open-air views. Totally glassed in, it was good to view when you could peek beyond the shoulders :) Would I go back again? I'd recommend the Rock for those doing eeney-meeney-miney...."

There was a queue for booking tickets and this moved quickly while we were waiting and most people seemed to be able to book a time slot close to the time they arrived. The lift up is interesting but be sure to have aids to help with the ear popping! It takes 60 seconds for a hundred floors! There is a display on the way up and down but the highlight are the views.

One World is very organized as opposed to the older Empire State Bldg tour. We paid for the guaranteed time tickets and were at the top within 10 minutes of getting to the location. The view on top on the day we went was spectacular, because we had a rare event, a clear sunny day in NYC. We went early morning (9am) and though it was not very busy, taking pictures while facing the still rising sun meant the pics would not be their best. On the plus side, there were fewer people there and you could take your time and see all around. There is an eatery there as well that might be interesting for a future visit.

We had booked our tickets in advance and were up at the top within just a few minutes, much faster even than to the Top of the Rock. We ate lunch and cocktails in the restaurant on the top, and everything tasted great. The servers were very friendly but the service itself was spotty. We waited for menus for about ten minutes, and our cocktails/drinks actually came after the food.Really my only real complaint is that there is nowhere to sit down up top, apart from on the ledge in front of the windows. This meant that it wasn't very crowded when we visited, but about 30% of the view was blocked by people sitting on the raised ledge and plaiyng on their phones with their backs to the windows, not even looking out. I am only 5'2'', so it was annoying that I couldn't really enjoy the view over the people sitting around. The space lends itself to hanging out and enjoying the vibe, but there is nowhere to do that. Otherwise, this attraction was really well planned and enjoyable."

I wonder what happens during rainy or cold weather. You do have to submit to a full security inspection when you enter the building, same as the 9/11 museum. The elevator ride was very fast and displayed a timeline of NYC. We decided on having lunch in the restaurant and only had to wait 20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. We sat at the bar, turned around and enjoyed the view towards mid-town Manhattan. The hamburgers and service were both good, and the prices not too bad considering where you are eating. Tables had a wonderful view."

We stood where they told us to and waited for someone to get us - but turns out no one comes to the area where they had us gather. we overheard someone say 'the 315s are lining up\" so we then lined up. We waited in lines for over an hour and 15 minutes before we even got to the top. I have been to numerous attractions like this - Empire State, Sears Tower, etc. And know there will always be some sort of wait. But this was the worst And we were outside for a good chunk of it with no shade. For most of the wait there is nothing to see or do. We were so late we could only stay at the top for 10 minutes then had to get to an early dinner reservation. For the amount they charge $32 plus tax - it should be a) more organized and b) less overbooked. There were just too many people there. I strongly recommend you wait until they iron out some of the kinks."

After entering the building we proceeded downstairs to enter the foyer area where we queues again to go through the usual security check. The line was long but moved reasonably quickly. After security we then entered a underground area and 3 queue area. We weaved through what seemed to be a never ending maze of rocks before reaching the elevators. The elevator ride was fantastic. The walls showed the evolution and growth of Manhattan and was one of the memorable features of the experience. Look for it on YouTube to see what I mean. After the elevators we the queues yet again in a corridor. Everyone was wondering what was going on. After about 5-10 Minster doors opened and we stood facing a wall. Shortly after a short film played before revealing the stunning view looking north. The wall then closed. This gave a brief look at what was to come. After this we were then hoarded into a room where we were encouraged to buy an iPad type tour of the skyline which would point out points of interest. I think it was $15. By this time we just wanted to see the view and I don't think many, if any, took up the iPad tour viewer. We then finally entered the observatory. The views are beyond fantastic and pictures do not do it justice, this is not helped though by taking pictures behind glass with reflection (see my pics) and when sunny (like it was) the reflections are terrible and some pictures were horribly dark. Where the sun wasn't shining on the building the pictures where better but again reflection was a problem. In summery the queuing is beyond monotonous and I even mentioned it to one of the staff who just laughed. The need to sell you extras is not needed as most people should know the most famous buildings. But the views are FANTASTIC, just don't expect great pictures when the suns out."

            "review": "Great view.. Just like the other nearly 1million who had visited before me, visiting the new World Trade Center was a must-do experience. We got there early enough in the morning that there was nearly no line. we walked right in.There is a security check pretty much identical to the TSA checks we are all used to by now. Going to the top costs $32 per person. But it costs the same for the Empire State. you are directed along a path with photos and testimonials from the workers and designers of the towers. Then you go through a corridor with fake rock walls to get to the elevators. The rock is supposed to remind you that this is the strongest building ever made. Getting to the top was quick. The elevators are the fastest I have ever seen. less than a minute to get to the top. Going early in the AM is great except you are looking into the sun and some views are tough to photograph. there are a couple restaurants and a gift shop up at the top. Both are somewhat pricey which is to be expected considering where you are. $35 t shirts and $8 magnets are the order of the day! There were guys at the observatory floor who would give little spiels about New York or some current event. It was interesting to listen to them.It wasn't too crowded when we were there. I spent maybe an hour or so up there. You never get tired of the view. They had a deal where you can rent an Ipad which has an interactive display which will tell you what you are looking at which might have been a good idea. I think it cost about $15 or so. This is a great attraction. Don't miss the memorial and museum at the base of the tower."

At $32 per person, it's worth doing once, but I probably won't repeat. The iPad feature is an additional $15. Although I don't think everybody in the family needs one, it might be worth the $15 to have one iPad for the whole party. We did not get the iPad, but in hindsight, I wouldn't have minded learning more about what I was looking at. The best part of the entire experience is probably the elevator ride on the way up. The inside walls of the elevator are all LCD screens, except for the door. It's pretty cool to watch the LCD screens simulate the construction that has gone on over the years outside, as a timeline shows along with the video. It's also very moving to see a picture of The Twin Towers, which then disappear as the timeline gets to 2001. At the top, it's pretty crowded, but you can still get over to some window space fairly easily. Bring a good camera. There were plenty of selfie sticks on display. What was probably just as impressive as the view from the top, was the view from the bottom, outside of the building looking straight up. The way the building was designed, as you stare up at the top from the bottom, it looks like the building rises and converges into a single point as it approaches the heavens. The building design may look a little strange from far away, but as you stare at the top from the bottom, you can appreciate why they designed it the way that they did. And that view is free."

It was great to bypass the lines and get to the views fairly quickly. The elevator ride up was wonderful with seeing NYC from the very beginning to now. The movie and the surprise view was an added bonus. The views were spectacular. I would recommend seeing it later in the day, the sunset is just gorgeous. The only glitch in this trip was the wait at the bottom. It was chaotic to say the least. There were no distinct areas for regular ticket holders and priority tickets holders. People who wanted to buy tickets had to go through the cordoned off area to the inside. There should maybe be a separate door for just people going in to buy tickets. There should be 2 cordoned off areas, one for regular ticket holders and one for priority tickets as it was very confusing as to where to go and stand while waiting. Other than that the experience itself was worth it and I would definitely do it again."

First there's the ticket-buying process: base adult price of $32 and a dozen more expensive flavors of tickets so they can start sucking more money out of you right away: pay more if you don't know what time of day you'll arrive; pay more if you don't want to wait in line; etc.Then it's an interminable series of lines. A line outside; a line inside; a line to go through airport-style security; a line to go up the elevator. Self-congratulatory videos accompany your wait.Then a single redeeming quality: floor-to-ceiling video screens in the elevator with a cool simulated time-lapse of New York's development.Next: more waiting! This time for some glorified advertisement for New York on poorly projection-mapped screens that open ceremoniously for your first taste of the view.BUT THEN! You're herded into another corral by some suspiciously friendly folks who start giving a presentation...oh wait, they're trying to rent you a tablet ($15?) that points out landmarks and such. You're being forced to wait even longer so they can sell you some piece of junk. This was infuriating. Fortunately, you don't actually need to stand for any of this; you can just keep going. Once we realized this, most of the crowd left with us.Then the obligatory stand-in-front-of-green-screen-for-your-overpriced-souvenir-photo, which actually isn't obligatory if you stay to the left and forcefully deny the direction of the photographers. Don't give them the satisfaction.Finally you can go down to the observation level and check out the view. It's great, obviously, but you're inside the whole time and bright lights from various useless attractions created a fair amount of glare for our twilight visit.But before you go: another line!!! This time for the elevator down. Ours stretched halfway around the observation level; took about 15 minutes just to get out of the place.My recommendation: any tall building in New York will have a great view. Find something less expensive, pretentious, and insulting to your intelligence."

Upon arriving at the suggested 15 minutes early, there was nothing but chaos and people all over the sidewalk, most having no idea where to go at all, Fighting through the crowd to try and find an employee, once I found one I was told they were just lining up people with tickets from an hour before our time, so we were in for a long wait! Once in the building, it was a pretty quick move to get to the top. The elevator ride is cool with the video that plays. Once at the top, the views are certainly amazing, as good as it gets. The downside, unlike the Empire State Building, the entire observatory is enclosed. This makes it hard to get a good picture, ad the glass reflects all inside light, and the number of fingerprints all over the glass from people that can't keeps their hand off for whatever reason. ESB is better because you are outside, so you get the sounds of the city as well, which just adds to the experience. The staff at One World are pretty clueless as well. I asked about 10 members the same question, and pretty much got a different answer from each one. Cashiers at the souvenir store seemed that they would rather be anywhere but there as well. Overall I was disappointed in my visit here, unlikely I'd go back. ESB is a far better experience, and stays open later as well."

It took myself and some other visitors talking to a supervisor to get someone to come outside and try and separate the people waiting into groups based on their time slots. With all of the money they put into that building, all they'd really need are some \"now serving\" signs over the lines, telling people which line to get into for their time slot.

But there are some things worth knowing before you go.The lines are long - even with timed entry tickets (at a starting rate of $32 for adults.) Buy tickets online before you go to cut out 1 line to wait in. We had timed ticket for 3:15 on a Saturday. We hadn't gotten to the elevators by 4:15. There is a line outside the building that they put you in based on your timed (every 15 min) ticket. You wait there for some time (for us 30+ mins) outside - so be prepared for the weather. Then you get inside - don't get excited yet. There's still a long way to go. You go down an escalator and then get in line for the security check point. After security there is a very long line for the elevators -- you're channeled here in your timed group. The area where you wait for the elevators includes some good video content on the building of the tower. Then it moves into a narrow area of fake granite to show the bedrock of Manhattan. This area could be claustrophobic for some. The content is good - but the line is long and crowded. They have not figured out how Disney world tricks you into not realizing you are in line.Finally you get to the elevators (note more than an hour for our experience on a Fall Saturday.) The elevator ride up is cool -there's a video graphic reel that shows NYC growing over time as your ascend. Close your eyes or look at the door if motion bothers you.When you reach the top, guess what there is another line. To get into the preview area - another good video graphic thing but you're anxious to see the real view. After the video intro you exit to an area where they pitch hard selling you photos and hand held devices for more info (read - another money maker for them). Finally you get to go down a flight to the 360 observation deck. Where you can battle your way to the windows through the 100's of other people to get a view. The views are amazing. You want to see this. Just be prepared for a long wait. And a lot of \"buy more\" opportunities. And did I mentioned there is a line to get the elevators down. Really.There did appear to be a way to skip some of the lines - if I did it again I would gladly spring the extra $$ for the VIP entry. Same crowds at the top - but you skip some of the lines on the ground.Who ever is running the observation deck is clearly trying to pump too many people through each hour. They need to cut ticket sales back so if you buy a 3:15 ticket you are let into security at 3:15. It's not that difficult to figure out how many people can fit in the 4 small elevators and how many times they can go up and down in a hour. That should be the max sales. Clearly it isn't. If you go. Go early in the day. And/or buy the express ticket."

After you enter the building you are directed towards one of 4 elevators.As the elevator goes up you see the New York skyline being built over the years with a quick glimpse of the former WTC. After you exit the elevator you enter a theater playing a short 2-3minute movie called the Spirit of New York. The screens lift up and you see all of Manhattan in it's glory with mesmerizing music. This brought a tear to my eye.There is truly nothing like this in New York, even the world.

We visited the 9/11 museum last year which was outstanding and as the One World Observatory had just opened we decided to give it a go.Obviously this is a very important building and visiting it in itself is very moving but speaking purely in terms of views I think the Empire State Building is superior as you get to see upper and Lower Manhattan including Central park whereas here you only get a view of Brooklyn/Lower Manhattan. Also as it's completely enclosed it doesn't feel as exciting as the Empire State building and you can't take good photos as your reflection in the window shows. There were also loads of people sat in the windows looking at their phones which was annoying as it obscures the view for other people. Would be good if there were benches or chairs away from the window so people who need to can rest.The best bit by far is the lift, now that is an experience - I won't spoil the surprise. Didn't appreciate the hard sell of the Tablet experience, I'm not even sure what it was but after paying $32 each to get in I wasn't parting with anymore cash. People were walking around with the tablets with the volume ridiculously loud as well which was annoying. Getting out of the observation deck was an ordeal, the exit should be signposted more clearly. Funnily enough I kept ending up by the cafe...I wonder if that is intentional?My advice if you're choosing between here, the Empire State Building and Rockerfeller centre is to choose from the 2 latter options as the view is better. The 9/11 museum and memorial are excellent though, a very moving tribute to those who died and I would definitely recommend a visit to both.Anyone wanting a hearty deli lunch after should head over to Stage Door which is excellent."

Was fascinating.Also, this has to be the best spot to truly understand the scale of the Twin Towers, when you look down from One World Trade Centre you can see the memorial pools, especially lit up a night in the footprint of the foundations of each Twin Tower.I went up after my trip through the 9/11 Museum.

We saw a visual display depicted of outside and then the wall lifted and we saw the real view. It was breathtaking. Next we were ushered through to an area with outside views where we were invited to buy time on an orientated iPad. $15. Worth it cause you could tap on certain landmarks and zoom in for an audio/visual history. Next we went downstairs to the real 360* visual. Well worth the visit. Awesome.

I would assume the priority tickets would help if you are restricted to weekend only visiting.The staff were nonchalant and rude, but this is the typical jobsworth style at Manhatten tourist destinations. It is too commercialised and they evidently want to fleece you for every buck. You've already paid $32, get to the top and they almost coersively go on the hard sell for the interactive Ipads. Use your eyes those are free, if you have been organised you will already have a guide book on NY which can give you exactly the same information for free.Thankfully it wasn't to busy, but at times you struggle to see the highlights. It doesn't have the wow factor of the Empire State building as there isn't an open viewing deck-they have missed a trick here.

From the moment we got in line, the staff were courteous and friendly. The elevator ride itself was worth the entrance fee alone. Totally unexpected. Tip..... get your camera out before you get in. You'll miss it if you don't. Then there is another graphics show that has a twist.One of the major gripes is the supposed hard sell of the interactive tablet. Rubbish. It is a short presentation that the majority of people don't choose to go with. We did and for $15 it is worth doing. We stayed in the tower a lot longer by having the tablet, thus getting more value for money from the experience. It is a bit tricky to get used to but once you crack it you'll be like a kid with a new toy.The actual viewing area is very much like the Hancock Tower in Chicago. The only dissapointment for me was the glass floor portal. I had thought it was actually a view beneath your feet to the ground. It's not. It is a projection image. Whines about the photo thing are also misplaced. There isn't an attraction in the world that doesn't try to sell you a photo memento of your visit. Just say \"no thanks\" next time.

The views are stunning as you would expect but depending on the time of day of your visit photos aren't always easy to take as there can be a lot of reflection off the glass. The talks done by the Ambassadors are interesting and pitched at everyone so are enjoyable.

On previous visits to the city, I've been up the Empire State and Top of the Rock so it was great to get a different perspective from downtown. Even the lift up is an experience. We booked in advance in our hotel via mobile and had a specific time slot to visit just before 1pm. Hardly any queues and the security process was quick and efficient. We went walked through the bedrock and got into the lifts up in no time. We paid for an iPad guide when we got to the top. I'd really recommend this, the guide wasn't very expensive but really added to the experience. You position the map, it then moves as you turn and shows the points of interest. It does a helicopter fly over to the location so you can get a bit more information and a closer look. We combined this with a visit to the 9/11 memorial which made the trip up the tower much more meaningful especially when you look back down at the memorial pools below. The only downside was it was busy and it was difficult to get to the windows past all the people taking pictures. Not unusual for a tourist hotspot."

Unfortunately I wasn't that impressed with the view from the top, don't get me wrong it is a beautiful building but because it at the bottom of Manhattan you don't have a great all round view the way you do with the Empire State which is pretty much bang smack in the middle of the island. There's very strong security checks (understandably) and quite a long tour and information session to get through before you actually get to the top. The lift journey up is impressive as it shows Manhattan being built up over the years but I wont visit the top again, I'll stick to the Empire State."

The view from the observation gallery takes your breath away, a all-round view of New York and the Hudson river heading into the distance. Worth every penny to visit here.

Like a living organism, this great city has an unending repertoire of amazing poses, each one offering a new breathtaking view to its visitor. This is what you feel as you climb up to One World Observatory and take a 360 degree walk to observe the city. The way up is itself a fantastic trip as the walls of the fast elevator are projected with an animation about the settling of the Island of Manhattan. As you get to the top, a short documentary with present day life scenes is projected on drawn curtains which, at the end of the movie, are opened to present the real thing. Then the visitor is free to go round and choose its favorite view. Mine is the one facing East, the Brooklin and the three bridges. Strongly recommended."

The ride up on the elevator to the tallest building (102 floor) in western hemisphere in less than 60 seconds and than witnessing the story of the city through ages as you go up will be something that you remember for a long time. Dining/food is on 101 floor (but expensive) and there is also a gift shop.You can buy tickets either online or at the site. We bought PRIORITY ticket online which allowed us to expedited VIP entry. It was a 4th of july weekend so the extra cost was worth it.I recommend Standard admission ticket purchase online.Have fun......"

There's lots of space at the top to wander around and see the 360 degree views. You can hire an interactive tour guide viewfinder for $15, these are great if you don't know a lot about the city, way better than the audio tours at Empire State.

The views of the City and its environs are stunning. But the entire experience was brought down, and brought down hard by the hard press marketing that is done \"Disney\" style by the energetic twenty somethings that seem to be everywhere. From the time you buy your ticket, you're being told how wonderful the cafe is. Then when you step off the elevator you are greeted by one of them with a camera for \"Trade Center Imaging\" where you can pick up your photo after your visit. It's more like stepping off Space Mountain than visiting a landmark that was created out of a sobering respect for all who lost their lives there. In fact, when you get off the elevator, you are dropped off on the level with the cafe where they try to have you rent an iPad for $15 (after already spending $30 for admission) that will identify the buildings you can see from far above. The original Trade Center observatory had all the descriptions of the view for free below each window. Were it not for the views, I would not recommend anyone wasting money on this disrespectful sideshow. I know someone in management will probably respond to this review with some canned response that they are sorry that the Observatory did not meet my expectations. Let me respond directly by saying that my expectations are irrelevant. Given the importance of this site, a more tasteful presentation would have been a good idea."

The least expensive ticket was $32 for an adult, but it was worth every penny. One starts, one level below street level, in the bedrock. Read the projections on the rocks to understand this area, and the amount of steel needed to complete this project. From there, one listens to the stories of the people who helped raise this building....all so moving. The elevators then take you to the top of the building, with a projection on the back wall of the elevator. The projection shows a fascinating view of New York from the early 1600s to the present day, and also shows your elevation as you ascend. Once on the main floor, you are shown street views of various neighborhoods in the city which then opens up to the skyline of Manhattan. Just incredible. Unfortunately, this is followed up by the sales pitch for a photo opportunity, and a self-guide so you can understand what you are viewing. Food is available at 3 locations.... the bakery, the sandwich shop or at the sit down restaurant. A sit down meal of a cheeseburger and fries with a coke is about $32 with the 18% tip included. Get to the tower before noon, to avoid most crowds. At least two hours to enjoy it all."

The trip up (and down) in the elevator was exciting and technology was really fun. Next stop (I'm trying not to give away the big reveals) was awesome and then you are at the top with 360 degree views. It was a little cloudy that day so we were not able to \"see forever\" but it was great. We had lunch at the sit down restaurant as we were exhausted from all our walking that day. We sat down and had a glass of the house wine and then a delicious salmon salad with heirloom tomatoes. Service was very good and we felt relaxed and pampered. DON'T miss this experience. Also the workers were the best anywhere. Each was personable and knowledgeable. Lots of fun. Pricey but we felt it was worth it. Puts the Empire State Building to shame."

I recommend making a reservation and purchasing your ticket online ahead of time. For those who show up without a reservation the wait is long and winding - just like a visit to a top Disney ride. Its a bit hokey with the picture taking befire you enter the observatory - but am obvious source of revenue. Small gift shop for souveniers - I would skip the $12 pin as it is small and cheesy looking. ( The pin was an add-on to the price of my ticket when I booked online). Unless you like overpaying for snacks and drinks I would avoid the bar area. Just whoosh up in the speedy elevator to the top and relish the view."

Yes, I totally agree that the price of admission is absurd and it is rather hard to justify spending $32 just to get a view of the city. However, having said that, this is truly a once and done type of thing, call it a bucket list attraction. We arrived at 6:45 pm as we had dinner reservations at One restaurant at 7:30 pm so we paid the $32 fee and got two things out of that fee, \"admission\" to the restaurant and the observation deck. The staff was very friendly and were very welcoming from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. There is a security check in line which moves right along, very similar to airport security. The elevator ride to the 103 floor was 47 seconds and a cool experience in and of itself. The 360 degree walk around view from the top floors were simply amazing. It is something that most people in NYS won't get to do, much less people from all around the world. We enjoyed our stay on the observation deck and found the crowds to be light and the staff helpful. There are some touristy things that they will try to push on you, simply smile and say \"no.\" They will try to take your picture and sell you the photos as well as sell you an I Pod tour for $15, neither are necessary. Be advised, the observation deck closes at 8:00 pm, kind of early I thought. Overall, a very positive experience and one well worth doing. Bring your cash though, entry and everything being sold is highly priced."

The elevator trip to the 102nd floor was a treat in its own right, with video screens on each side showing a panoramic view of Manhattan island from its initial settlement to the present day, while displaying the elevator car's current height above sea level. The viewing space is impressively large and I crowded and the views are breathtaking in all directions! There are knowledgeable guides always available to point out things of interest and to answer visitors questions. My wife and I stopped at the restaurant in the hub of the observation area for a drink and a snack, and found it to be comfortable, the service prompt and the menu items fresh and tasty.

Of course, standing at 1,250 feet above street level, you will experience beautiful views of Manhattan and surrounding areas of the city, New Jersey and beyond. However, its not quite as good as it could be. There are two elements that I found disappointing; #1. There is no outside observation deck. When asked why, I was given the lame excuse that we were much too high to safely go outside. Really? I can recall the beautiful vistas from the spacious outdoor deck of the original World Trade Tower #2. Sadly, everything at the new One World Observatory is enclosed in glass, making it exceptionally difficult to shoot pictures without significant glare, even with a polarizing filter. There is no sense of really being \"there\", standing outside at 1,250 feet. #2. There is a feeling of too much commercialism. I'm not talking about the obligatory souvenir shop, its there with plenty of \"things\" to buy, but there are also these two large circular Kiosks on either side of the observatory floor, each with a carnival barker, seemingly stuck in hyper-animated mode shouting into a microphone about Pizza, Bagels and every other kind of NYC kitsch. I may be wrong, but I found this element of the observatory to be totally unnecessary, annoying and amateurish. The view is great, but the experience doesn't lend itself to lingering a while and looking at the city below. On the contrary, one lap around the observatory floor, I was ready to descend.

However, highly unimpressed and almost dismayed/disgusted at the marketing and \"anything to make a big buck\" sales gimmicks inside. The extortion on capitalizing on the REASON that building is there in the first place was disgusting to me. Before you can even get into the building, you have to deal with sales pitches...iPads to view and name places in the city, pictures taken, cards for a variable discount that can only be displayed once you make a purchase if your card has a discount on it, and the pay more for expedited fares so as not to stand in line. I opted to do this as my daughter was on a tight time frame over the weekend with college visits and there was no way we could guarantee entrance in time to make the next appointment. We paid double the price to guarantee \"expedited\" entrance at anytime on Sat....and still stood in a line for the elevator and had to go through all the money making schemes along the way. If you MUST have an open ended time, then I guess you'll have to pay the exorbitant fees to have an open time on one weekend day ($60) or even more for the entire weekend ($90) vs the standard ticket of about $40. It was $130 for my daughter and I to ride to the top and view the city without standing in line on a Saturday Flex pass. Other than the views and architect of the building (from the design to the elevators to its massiveness), the rest is like entering an amusement park with the lines and the sales gimmicks. The restaurant which was beyond ridiculous pricing...$14 for a plate of brussel sprouts, $24 for a hamburger no side and $20 for a glass of wine. I eat in fine/nice establishments regularly but found this extreme by all measures. Yes the food was plated well but there was nothing overly special about it to price so high for a small portion other than the view, which we already paid for. The building is not the Twin Towers nor was it ever designed to be so. It was designed to by a symbol of what happened and that we will prevail, not to replace or take away from what was. I appreciate that greatly. The Twin Towers and their magnitude will ALWAYS be remembered in their greatness and nothing can replace or take away from that or what happened. So all in all, although the view on top is amazing beyond words and worth seeing at least once at the cheapest entry if you have time to wait in line as well as upstairs to get a view....the windows do tend to be crowded around and you wait a while to get a window view and get a picture, People tend to sit along the window with their children and you can't get up to the windows. I would suggest perhaps benches along the wall for people to sit on to rest and not in the windows to provide an opportunity for all visiting to see and enjoy at leisure. I would also suggest eliminating all the sales stuff. You are truly taking away from what the real reason of the building is...and where does all the money go from the pictures and iPad rentals? Into the 911 Memorial upkeep or into pockets?"

Once at the tower we got inside very fast and really, no need to spend the extra money for the fast lane. And we went in June, after the school were closed. So it was basically in full tourist season. The elevator ride was so cool. All the walls were like a television screen and they really put up a show. Once on top, you have to wait for a short documentary on the history of NYC.... And then, the surprise happens. Can't write it down cause it would spoil the surprise. Let me tell you, it was so cool!Then you finally walk to the observatory. Even though I knew there were a lot of people, it didn't feel crowded cause the whole floor is for the viewing and the windows are big and tall. You get a full 360* view of Manhattan. The only downside is I have been on the Empire and the top of the rock and in those building you are actually out on the balcony. This building is all enclosed so I don't really have the real \"feeling\"... Just a view... I loved it, but my favorite is still the top of the rock."

Thankfully it was a nice day so I sat on the bench near the entrance. I had my ticket checked four times before boarding the elevator. Seems a bit excessive as the line simply keeps moving from one location to another. Most employees were incredibly kind and friendly but a couple of them at the screening area were rude and surly----must have been TSA trained! The elevator ride to the top took less than a minute with a fascinating video display of lower Manhattan from primitive times til today. Views at the top are stunning. I found the hawking of photos and guides a bit off putting but typical of key tourist locations these days. As I said, a definite must see in NYC!"

I have gone twice, once at sunset and once at 11:00 at night. Seems as of late the operation hours have changed and the deck now closes at 8pm, as it used to be 12am. Not sure when or why the time changed. Went this past Wednesday and at 630pm was told no tickets were available for the remainder of the evening. Upon that news I went to the online ticket sight and saw tickets were available until 7:30 pm so I went right to the gentleman who told me there we're no tickets and asked why they were available to buy and he stumbled all over his words and tried backtracking. I was extremely disappointed that the workers lied and we're turning families away making it appear that they just wanted to ensure they got to go home on time. This to me was a huge change from my previous visit when we saw the deck was open until midnight so we walked right up and bought tickets. The other disappointment was how rude some of the visitors were sitting in the window sills charging their phones and refusing to get up for the experience of the 100's of other visitors. There is no staff to be found to keep the crowds moving to ensure the $32 entry fee is worth while which is a huge disappointment. I think EVERYONE has been forgotten that this is sacred ground especially for myself who lost a loved one on 9-11. It has become a tourist nightmare with selfie sticks galore. There need to be some minor changes to ensure that the experience remains to be amazing as the architects dreamed it would be."

Great platform to gaze uptown but you get equally great views of Brooklyn, Queens, NJ and out across the bay towards Staten Island. Plenty of room to move about and a couple of interactive platforms to use if you wish. The ride skywards is impressive - great digital storyboard showing the development of NYC while you get whizzed upwards. Don't want to give too much away however the 'reveal' at the top is breathtaking - it's honestly breathtaking as I didn't see it coming & was genuinely blown away.

You can only be in the observatory unless you pay more to see more. It doesn't take more than 1 1/2 hours to tour the whole observatory, unless you decide to eat while you're there (which is also very expensive). I think they should have more discounts for students and seniors. My mom went and so excited to see it. When we got up there, she couldn't even enjoy the view because she was already tired of walking from the train station, to the line to go in , line to go in the elevator, line to see a 7 seconds show. She just sat at one of the steps and relaxed."

Okay, incredible views following an incredibly fast elevator ride. Since there are so many visitors, we were moved from one viewing place to the next en masse, and then lectured, while standing, encouraged to rent ipads for more info (not worth it to native NYers) and then pushed along. Crowded shopping and lunching. (Maybe there are hours that are less crowded than others.) Overall, a rather alienating experience, which mimics, in my view, the creation of the edifice and its predecessors."

I am beyond impressed at the new tower. The elevator ride is impressive and it must be pressurized, as I didn't have any ear popping issues that always plagued me in the old WTC. I love the video that plays as you ride up. The presentation, from the minute you buy your ticket and enter to the ride back down, is just spectacular. The people working there are friendly and helpful. The one part that I wasn't wild about was the hard sell for the iPad \"tour guide.\" They make you stand in a group and listen to the presentation before you go to the observatory. They would do better to sell those on the observatory floor. The ride down is as spectacular as the ride up, with another really cool video. Kudos to NYC for building this tower and creating the beautiful reflecting pools and park area so people can come to enjoy, but also reflect on that day. I highly recommend this tour."

The staff on the ground were great and hurried us through to the elevators. Here's where it started to go wrong.Rather than just take you straight to the observation deck so we could watch the sun set, you are herded into a holding stable and forced to watch a video. The screencollapses and you have a view of the city for 5 seconds before they close it and herd you to another holding stable to try to sell you some iPad with a long speech.You are finally let down to the observation deck where the lighting is so bad there are huge glares on the window, making taking a good photo challenging to say the least. We missed the sunset because of all their sales speeches and were really disappointed. They have some huge and bright TV screens which ruin the zen and some stupid screen you can stand on.They really could have done a better job and also made it more peaceful environment to respect those that died in the previous towers. Sad really that it's so commercialized."

The view is nice enough, but the salesiness of the staff plus the saccharine patriotism that the whole \"experience\" is drenched in take the gloss away from it.It's also worth mentioning that the glass reflects pretty badly, so photography doesn't work great. And there's nowhere to sit down, which means that people deciding to take a breather end up sitting on the ledge, hogging the view for others.Overall this is desperately missable. Top of the Rock is stacks better, but then so is pretty much anything else you can do in NYC in the the space of an hour or two."

This was an even better decision than I could have imagined. I had seen the video from the elevators online, and I had some idea of what to expect, having been in other skyscrapers. I also expected a few tears to well up as I looked at my former apartment building and remembered the events of 9/11. I did not expect such an awe-inspiring sunset. There was near silence on the New Jersey side of the building, as we watched a powerful red globe disappear in the distance at a pace difficult to capture on film. I've seen plenty of gorgeous sunsets over the Grand Canyon and many mountain ranges, but this was extraordinary. One hundred floors in the sky, the bustling city looks like a big puzzle we can't quite understand. Then, the sun breathes us in, warms us, and reminds us what it is to be humans in community.If you're looking for the lights and spectacle of Times Square, this isn't it. But if you want to experience a full range of thoughts and emotions, this might fit the bill."

I wouldn't exactly say those hopes were dashed, but the new observatory certainly didn't live up to my expectations.You begin your visit in the basement where videos of construction workers tell the story of 1WTC's rise. Is it weird that they barely allude to 9/11? Yes.Then you snake through the building's bedrock foundations, which looked fake. I asked: they are fake. However, any disappointment you may feel is alleviated by the INCREDIBLE elevator ride up to the top floor. The video of Manhattan's rise from wooded village to city of skyscrapers is amazing. It's a shame they only let you ride it once.Then, you watch a dorky video on the 102nd before finally being allowed to explore. The views are fantastic. Everything else? Meh. Overpriced merchandise in the gift shop, dumb interactive displays about NYC, boring food. Sure, you're there for the views not the food, but for $32 a ticket, I was surprised how run-of-the-mill everything was. I was not surprised that the over-eager staff treated everything like it was SOOOOO amazing, as if they had to convince everyone that it wasn't a waste of time.Tl;Dr: come for the view and the super cool ride to the top. Don't expect much more."

You get a real sense of an uplifting creation from a city hit so hard by something so devastating. We have been telling all of our friends and family since returning home that they HAVE to visit the observatory, my partner has had no qualms with admitting how emotional he got at a certain surprise reveal! Granted the weather was amazing the day we visited, but the views are incredible regardless, you can stay there for as long as you'd like gazing down at the city and the staff are so friendly, polite and helpful. We felt like, out of all the \"observatory attractions\" in NYC, this one, is one where you just keep walking round and around to see something new or just wander knowing you're looking at the best view in the world. I purchased the basic $29.39 ticket and it is worth the money ten times over, cannot recommend this enough! It can be a little busy up there, but there are waves of people coming through and in between those waves are moments where its actually quite peaceful up there! Cant recommend this highly enough...

Then Christine got a nice gentleman named William to escort me to guest services where Ed assisted me. Ed did everything possible to try and verify my voucher but was ultimately unsuccessfully. I was very impressed with everyone who assisted me. Well, needless to say, I had to buy a ticket right there. I am so impressed with the staff, but I was blown away at my observation experience. From the moment you step into the elevator, you are inundated with sensory overload; I mean that in a good way. The 100 floor ride takes about 40 seconds and all the while images appear on the 3 walls. When you exit the elevator, an entire wall is displaying a movie of the views you will be experiencing. Afterwards you make your way to the next level which has a cafe and fairly fancy restaurant and bar. The top level has 360 degree views that are absolutely breathtaking. So don't miss this attraction when you are in New York."

The 360 degree views from the observatory floor are truly breathtaking but, as with the (infinitely superior) ESB and Top of the Rock, it is pricey for what it is (i.e. a ride in an elevator and a chance to then wander, unguided, around a viewing floor). The venue offers an \"explore NYC\" app preloaded on to rentable iPads, which is intended to help you find out more about the city and all that you are seeing as you look out from the viewing floor, however, this comes at an additional cost and there's an annoying sales push on it as you enter the observatory floor. That said, I didn't see anyone actually take it up.....possibly because it will set you back an additional $15 per person over and above the entrance fee you've already paid just to get to the observatory in the first place! I must say, the app did look rather clever but, as I didn't rent it either, I couldn't say whether it is worth either the time or the additional expense.The exhibit as you first enter the site at basement level seems to have been installed in an effort to make visitors feel they are getting more bang for their buck than just a viewing opportunity, but there's really very little to it; it lacks substance and is really not that interesting. You can easily skip through it without lingering and rest assured that you're missing nothing of any great interest. The graphics of an evolving NYC as you ascend in the lift are pretty clever though. I also didn't \"get\" the point of the Sky Portal. This appears to be a video feed under part of the observatory floor showing footage of the street below. Essentially though, you are standing on a tv screen which is mounted under the floor - not on an actual glass floor. Sorry, but I see no point to this at all. It's just bizarre.... It's no CN Tower.I prebooked my tickets online in advance for a (reasonably) early morning slot. That turned out to have been a good idea (infact, I think it's their recommendation too) as I got in on time without having to wait at all, whereas the line for entry on spec was huge & slow by the time I came to be leaving.All in all, this will no doubt be / become one of the \"must-visit\" sights in NYC - not least because of its location and novelty. Personally, that is why I felt I should go but something about it somehow just left me a little disappointed at the end.

After a short introduction to a tablet you can hire you are on the deck, its a large space with views all around everywhere including Manhattan and its 5 boroughs.If your gonna visit the NYC building and have limited time i would do the one world and the top of the rock leaving the empire state out unless you have a lot of time."

And before entering the One World building, visiting the memorial from the original towers was a moving experience, which was free and separate from the One World Observatory visit. But going up into this tower felt like a crowd control, Disney-like experience without the fun. It started with a fake cave area with plastic walls and dim lights that were supposed to represent the rock that the building is set in. Then on the way up to the observatory, the group was constantly stopped to give a presentation or a sales pitch. And of course, the observatory is indoors, so you are behind glass the entire time. Compared with the Empire State Building, in which you can basically just wait in line and go right up, and have the open air views, this was so frustrating. I finally just walked right past the obligatory photo taking because I had quite enough of their tourist requirements. Maybe this is a must-see in NYC, but be prepared to be handled by their well-trained handlers."

There is plenty of space for everybody to enjoy the view. The windows are top to botttom and you have a 360 degrees view. You must go on a clear sky day or in the night (when it's more expensive but you will enjoy the spctacle of lights).I definitely had a good view of Downtown and Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty and a bit of New Jersey but no Uptown or Central Park.

It is also very accessible by subway and taxi. I get motion sickness, so I would close your eyes when in the elevator because there is a video. I would combine a visit to the Observatory with a visit to the pools where the Twin Towers once stood. This whole area is a great tribute to 9-11."

We have been coming to NY for many years - we remember visiting the old World Trade Center and have been watching One World Trade Center going up with interest. So we had to go up here this year! We went up on a clear sunny day and were very impressed with the whole experience. The elevator ride gives a visual history of Manhattan from before the island was inhabited to the present day - as you ride up you see Manhattan growing. On your right the south tower of the old World Trade Center briefly appears and disappears. It gives a sense of the history of the island / New York and also the ephemerality of buildings and historical events. There's a short film with images of New York when you come out of the elevator. I'm not quite sure what the purpose of this is, but it was fine. The observatory itself is great. They try to sell you a kind of iPad guide to New York which we bypassed, in favour of just wandering round looking at the view. We arrived at about 5pm (on a Thursday) and there was no line at all. We stayed for sunset and a view of the city at night, passing time in the bar (expensive, but you can't beat the view, and we had a table by the window). We had a great time. Also, every single member of staff we met was friendly and helpful, from the guys who checked the tickets, the security guard, everyone in the observatory, the waitress... You can buy a ticket in advance online to save time, either print-at-home or on a mobile device."

I've been to a lot of observatories: the CN Tower in Toronto, the John Hancock building in Boston, etc. When I think of an observatory, I think of a place where you ride the elevator to the top, look around, and take pictures. This was so much more than that. There was a lot of history to learn, and some amazing videos about the construction of the new tower after 9/11. The elevator ride was smooth and so fast. We went 102 floors in the time it normally takes to go just a few floors in most buildings. The video as the elevator rose up showed Manhattan changing over time, from when it was first discovered and used for farm lands, to the present. Upon arrival to the first floor, there was a huge, skyline shaped screen that showed all the exciting things happening in the city at any given time, and when that was over, the screen lifted up in sections, revealing the spectacular view. I thought I might cry! Then we got to finally do the traditional walk around, look out, and take pictures sort of thing. However, there was also an interactive show where a \"concierge\" took you, virtually, to different tourist attractions around the city so you could get recommendations of things to do at any given moment. He also taught us a bunch of history and interesting facts about these attractions that I never knew, so it was really interesting. The ticket price was $32, which at first had me hemming and hawing, but it really was well worth it!"

If possible, hang around for the sunset over Jersey, then look north to the twinkling lights of midtown. Night pictures are a little tricky, watch for reflections behind you, and the multi-pane glass may require a little post production editing. Day pix, no problem, and use your panorama feature that most cameras today have. The one negative, there are no real benches to relax on, just the small and low casings below the windows where people park themselves, making access close to the window, a little difficult. But it all works out, maybe management has plans for better seating. And if you know the weather will be good when you plan to go, buy your tix on line.

Everyone goes through a metal detector so you can bring anything you want with you. The elevator from ground floor to 102 Floor takes 60 seconds which you don't even feel because you're watching a video of New York from the 1600s to the present. At the top you watch another video about New York and then the screen opens to the actual view. Make sure you go on a clear day because if not the view wouldn't be as good and you'd waste your money. ($32.-18-64) There are 3 viewing floors and you can get up very close to the windows. Well worth it and a great tribute to all who died in 9/11!"

Also, some of the windows are not perfectly clean, although it may be unreasonable to expect them to clean them constantly with such crowds. Still, we are glad we visited, and we did get some great photos. They take your photo on the way in and then give you a chance to buy it.

The view is stunning, and you don't need to hear anything else if that's all you're looking for. It is the tallest building on the continent, and for that alone the cost is justifiable.1WTC is marvelous inside and out, and no doubt that it can be best experienced when going to the top. The glass and marble give the place an eccentric and modern look that's hard to not appreciate. The elevator is really a highlight of the whole experience, as it takes under a minute from the visitor center near the ground to reach the observatory, a mind-blowing feat in concept alone. It's just too bad that it doesn't have windows!My biggest complaint about the whole thing is how commercialized it is. The attempt to further inflate the already steep $32 a person to merely go to the top by adding priority lines and photo ops is a little too in-your-face at times, and it dampens the raw authenticity of being able to peer out the windows at the city below. In addition, the pre-show after leaving the elevator (slight spoiler alert) has a dramatic, and admittedly epic, conclusion, but it feels somehow corny and out of place when compared to the city's other skyscraper observatories.If you are willing to shell out the money to go to One World Observatory, you will enjoy it. It is not the best observatory in NYC in terms of experience, but the view is something you probably won't want to miss anyway. Just leave this one until after you've had your fill of the ESB and Top of the Rock."

The new one is more like the Chicago Sears/Willis Towers as there is no longer an outdoor, open air section. The entire observation deck is enclosed in glass. The view is spectacular, as usual. The elevator to the top is much improved as compared to the old one, in speed, comfort (you do not feel any G force), and entertainment values. There is a panoramic video display that shows Manhattan as a wilderness flat land when you are on the 1st floor, and time lapses into the concrete jungle of today as you reach the top floors. The video even showed the rise of the old WTC Towers, and their disappearance from the Manhattan landscape. If you want to spend more than the $32 for the elevator ride (by the way, Empire State Building, which is NOT worth your time, is $30!), you can rent a tablet that will tell you interesting histories of any landmark you focus its camera on. This is recommended as the first thing you do when you visit Manhattan."

Trying lying on one of the granite benches at the base of the tower and just look up towards the top. It is a phenomenal architectural achievement. Watching the clouds drift by in the background of the building is tranquil. Watching the occasional jetliner departing LGA fly over is unnerving and begs the questions we all think about concerning those who lost their lives on this very site. One World trade Center is an emotional experience -- one in which the visitor can be overwhelmed by the many feelings this sight stimulates.All-in-all, the Freedom Tower and associated 9/11 memorial(s) is an important experience that every American should have the opportunity to visit. While the tour inside the building is great, one can easily enjoy this attraction without spending a dime!"

The lift is an amazing part of this experience but I won't ay any more to save the surprises both here and with the film you see at the top.You are then free to wander and view from the top floors - and what a view this is.

For views of Central Park, Top of the Rock can't be beat but the views of Lower Manhattan including the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge, the 9/11 reflecting pools, etc. are great here.

The one thing I recommend to the people who work there is to have someone permanently staffed just after the priority ticket ends. We ended up in a line and wasn't sure if we were required to stand there or if we should have continued farther up, but no one was around to ask. You rise very quickly in the elevator, which shows you the views of NYC as it was being built starting in the 1800's until today. Pay attention to the screen on the right which shows the twin towers going up and then coming down. No one mentioned it to us beforehand so I missed it. I overheard someone else pointing it out, but the picture change by the time I turned my head. They take you too the top, which is not where you can see out. I'm not sure why that is as there are windows all around, but blocked with panels. I'm not sure why they force you down a level to go to the conservatory. They have tablets you can rent for $15 that shows you places in the distance and some information about them, which is nice. Make sure you go up on a nice day if possible so you have a better view. The area is beautiful. I took pictures with my iPhone and they were okay. Sometimes I got a reflection on the window of people standing close so it's tricky to get a great picture, but it is possible."

This had only just opened when we visited but found the whole experience from booking the tickets to leaving after the visit very slick, smooth and professional. The views were amazing and there were lots of staff on sight to talk to. You could pay an additional fee for renting a ipad which detail each of the buildings and a little background which my son found fascinating. Only gripe was that they said an hour would be ample time to take it all in - it really wasn't and wish we had not be so time constrained."

We were visiting for the first time, and thought we should purchase tickets in advance. Which based on the long line outside was the right thing to do. If you buy tickets online, go right down to the entrance. What I don't understand is why they sell tickets in time blocks. When we got there we just walked right into the line, and the process started. It was 10:30 and we had purchased tickets for 11:15. I never once heard them call out times, nor did it seem to matter what time I purchased tickets for.SO (for those on a time schedule)... once you clear security it takes a good 30 minutes before your gazing upon the city. There is a line downstairs to get into the elevator, (the elevator rides takes less than 1 minute 'amazing'), then there is a short presentation, then there is a sales pitch for the ipad explorer ($15 i think) (it helps you figure out what your looking at) (we didn't purchase one), then another sales pitch for pictures.... AND then finally you are released into the observatory. 360 degree of views, AWESOME views of the city. The observatory is behind glass. no worries about weather,etc.The observatory was very crowed this particular day (and i believe this was a typical day), everyone taking selfies of themselves and conversing about the views. Some areas, particularly those facing uptown, were very crowded. You find yourself planning and plotting how to get up to the glass for a good view as you work around the observatory. Leaving is very quick... short line, quickly downstairs, and out you go.We spent about an one and a half hours gazing. SO the Total visit time was 2 hours... If you didn't purchase tickets beforehand, you better add another 30 minutes. One final note... if you buy tickets for a certain time, thinking that is when you are going to enter the elevator, then plan again."

The journey to the elevator and the journey to the top provided the context for the experience and the final reveal was well set up and stunning. We did not opt to use the iPad as we had visited New York several times before and knew what we were looking at. The views from the Top are wonderful, even on a slightly gloomy day. Beware of the \"selfie\" generation whose quest for the perfect pictures of themselves tends to be at the expense of their fellow citizens who would also like to take a photo - but are not so obsessed with being in that picture. Patience is required. Thought the merchandise and cafe prices were a little on the high side - but that's life! A \"must do\" when in NYC."

No waiting at all, we were whisked to the elevator to take us to the observation floor. The sixty second ascent gives you a through the ages development of NYC in surround type viewing on the screens/ walls of the elevator. Stepping out to the 360 degree 100th floor is like nothing you probably have ever experienced. Just looking at the city and surrounding areas from that vantage point is surreal. A short presentation by one of the staff filled us in on some interesting facts, but the view is what its all about. Just being at the scene of the tragic events that happened there left me a lump in my throat. Its something all persons should experience in their life time."

The key difference here is that the observatory was designed as part of the building rather than an add on later. We booked in advance and went straight in. Very efficient organisation and a smooth experience. Very friendly and helpful staff. The trip up in the lift is great. It doesn't really feel like it is moving and the incredible film show on the walls is really impressive. The observatory floors themselves are spacious and relaxed. The hand held device that helps identify what you can see isn't essential but it's a fun gadget and really good if you aren't familiar with the city landmarks. We went on a rainy day so we didn't get the most impressive views possible but it was still great. It's amazing being amongst the clouds and we just needed to move round to find the clear views as the clouds moved. We were up there for over an hour and really enjoyed it. The refreshments are a little disorganised but I'm guessing they will sort that out. To be honest, unless you are dying of thirst there isn't any need to spend your time getting a drink. Have one before you go up, the rest rooms are A-grade! The gift shop is nice, with some really good, high quality souvenirs and reasonably priced. We really enjoyed it, as did my parents.

A worker outside told us how amazing it was so we decided to try it out the next day. I was really disappointed once we got to the top at how shambolic the whole organisation of it was and how it lacked any elegance. It was so touristy and a bit cheap looking inside. There were no outside open air views (unlike the Empire State Building) and before we got in I didn't like the disorganisation with people pushing the queue to get in. People were sitting all around the edge of the windows that you couldn't even take in the view.It didn't help that the staff were shouting away and not really paying attention to what was happening just trying to squash in as many people as they could in one go.The worst part was the cheesy tourist movie played, before they revealed the actual 'view'. We squashed along a row to view the movie and it didn't even have anything to do with the erection of the building itself, it was just scenes shot around New York?I was all dressed up ready for a posh meal in the lovely restaurant that was promised after, but that didn't live up to expectation and you didn't get a further spectacular view...it was already what you had shimmied past other tourist to try and take in before. There was a cheap food/canteen style restaurant and it was separated by a curtain to the more posher restaurant. After much debate with the two staff at the desk we managed to get to the more 'sophisticated' side but it wasn't that much better apart from there was a bar and a more expensive menu. The posh expensive food did actually taste quite nice but they were small portions. A shame they didn't do the restaurant up a bit nicer as I thought the exclusivity of it would have made it a popular romantic choice of restaurant. It was not the best place I had been to eat on my holiday and the Empire State building really does top the view of No 1. Sorry to be so harsh just being honest!"

From the moment you get off the elevator they are trying to get you to rent an iPad. Then at various stations throughout the observatory, there are more people trying to sell you things. One person was even talking about discounted Broadway tickets. If I wanted that I would go to Times Square. I would say just go to Top of the Rock. You will see a great view without the sales pitches."

Very quick security check. 45 second lift journey where they showed an interesting video of New York through the ages, but lift was so packed was difficult to see properly. You were then led to viewing area, with another video and then shutters lifted to reveal view - which was amazing. Guides offered an I-Pad tour for 15$, didn't take up offer. 360 degree views and when we were there it was not particularly busy, so no jostling for space to take photos. My big issue was the reflection from glass spoiling a lot of my photos"

You are offered the option of hiring an interactive iPad which tells you about the landmarks, but we chose to simply enjoy the views. We opted for the Priority Pass entry as I was concerned about lining up in the hot weather. It's sometimes hard to work out if paying more is worth it so my advice is if you don't mind standing in lines and you aren't time poor, just opt for General Admission. Lines for general admission start forming about 20 minutes before the timed-entry you have booked for (attendants won't let you into the line early). Priority Pass lets you in about 5 minutes before the rest of the people in your timeslot (maybe 100 or more?) which means no standing in line and an easy pass through security screening and up the elevators. All the people in your timeslot eventually end up at the top to view a multi media presentation before moving en masse through to the viewing area."

The tickets are timed and we arrived 30 minutes before and were able to get in line. The staff was friendly and gave great directions. We walked in to the building at our assigned time but it still took almost 30 minutes before we got to the view.  To get to the elevators you must travel through a fake bedrock tunnel as they describe the solid stone which they excavated to build the building. Interesting, but very cheesy. The elevator experience was worth the price. The walls of the elevator are digital screens which show New York City growing from a small village to a major city. The presentation lasts the 60 seconds it takes to get to the 103rd floor.  Once you get out of the elevator there is more waiting before you're guided into a theater for another multimedia presentation. Finally, you get a teaser view out the windows. From there, you move onto the sales pitches. First, you're lined up and encouraged to rent an iPad for $15 that will \"enhance\" your experience. Feel free to just walk past and continue on. Even then, you still can't get to the windows. You have to wait for the usual green-screen photo opportunity of you and your family. Feel free to bypass that, too.  After taking an elevator down one level, you're finally free to view the entire city from the top of the building. The views are spectacular and on a clear day you can see forever. Strangely, the direct North view to the Manhattan skyline is blocked by a multimedia presentation and person giving information.  After all of that, you're free to wander, eat, and shop. The elevator experience down is even better than the one going up."

No food or open container is allowed because there's a restaurant at the observatory. You get to wind down to the basement or bedrock to board the state of the art elevator. Each car can hold ten to fifteen passengers. The opposite walls are lined with HD TV panels which together simulate the outside changing views at each timeline. The high speed elevator whisk you in around a minute. You hardly ever notice it.From the 102 floor you get to a chamber where they project multimedia presentations of New York City. When it ends, well you just get chills as they unveil the vista. Then your free to roam about the perimeter with your camera, binoculars, and friends. What ever you do don't go alone. It's fun with a group and families.Protip: get zoom binoculars that can take pictures. You can see Newark planes take off or cruise ships dock at the piers."

I was slightly disappointed at the number of smears on the glass from tourists. They would have done well to have someone cleaning the windows more regularly. There were regular speakers talking from the south point of the viewing deck. It was very interesting hearing what they had to say about the city, the views and the history.The observatory was not too crowded when we visited, and we got good opportunity to view all sides of the city. There was quite a large queue to go back down (similar to The Shard, London, or the Eiffel Tower, Paris \u2013 if you have been, you know what I mean), but it was quickly and efficiently managed. It is a family friendly attraction, I would certainly visit again. Closely located to the 911 Museum which I would highly recommend visiting."

You don't go outside as you do at the ESB but the more spacious environment makes for an altogether more pleasurable experience. Great map of world on entry that shows from where each new visitor is from when tickets are scanned...just a shame you can't see you own entry as part of the process.Will definitely return."

The elevator takes 50 seconds to go up 100 floors and there is a really creative interactive display in the elevator, both on the way up and on the way down. There are great views of Ellis Island and the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building, but you can't see Central Park from this location. It was difficult taking photos of the views from the windows because all the windows are grubby and smeared, and there are reflections from all the tourists inside the building onto the glass."

A very easy route and only took 5 minutes.We came last year to the 911 memorial and really wanted to see this this year. Directions to the world trade centre took you down to the trains and we were a little confused, but we did get to see inside the new centre which looks amazing. Finally found the entrance and was directed up the escalators and outside to wait to be called ! When we were waiting we realised we didn't need to go inside or follow the signs at all as we were right back where we started !! Think the signs need to be corrected. Unless they want you to see the new building!?!Once in you walk about the bottom section watching a film which is really interesting. Then you take a lift up to the observation deck which takes 60 seconds! Whilst in the lift and film is played which is brilliant .!I won't give it all away but it's pretty amazing. The views are awesome and I found it quite emotional too. Sadly it was a bit hazy so the views were not that great but it was still an amazing experience and had to be done. "

We decided to visit here as on previous visits to New York we have been to the Top of the Rock and the Empire State Building, so we decided this time to visit One World Trade Centre, you walk through an area that has a film of people saying how they felt working on the construction etc. Then you go up in the lift to the 102nd floor, as you ascend in about 60 seconds it shows you how New York has evolved over the years all around you.Once you reach the 102nd floor you watch a montage of New York and it's people, then the screen shoots up and you have a wonderful view of Manhattan. You then go down to the observatory on the 100th floor which gives you 360 degree views.There is a cafe and gift shop at the top, plenty of space to move around, all staff very pleasant, we visited on a Tuesday at about 6.15pm and we walked straight in, no wait.Definitely well worth a visit."

Once off the elevator you are taken into a room where once again the technology is amazing with views of the city. Finally the projected views disappear and you are looking at the expanse of the city in real time. Amazing! The site allows you to walk 360 degrees around to see all that New York offers but seen from the tallest building. There are knowledgeable staff available in this area should you have questions about what you are seeing. This floor also has a small gift shop. The ride down is even more exciting, taking seconds to descend. A must see and a tribute to New Yorkers."

We showed up around 2:15 and had tickets for 2pm, so we stood in the stand-by line for a little bit, but were inside quickly enough. When you first go in, you actually go down 1-2 stories to get through security.The fun begins right with the elevators going up. On the 3 non-door walls of the elevator are big displays. As you go up, they play a CGI time-lapse of the view around Manhattan and the surrounding area. Your ears will pop since you're going up ~1000 ft in about 60 seconds. Then you are ushered in to another long room with more displays. A 2 minute or so collage plays showing different aspects of NYC, and at the end there is quite the finale (I don't want to ruin in for people who don't know what it is).You end up going down 1 floor to do the actual walking around, but the views are spectacular! There are big direction letters in the group to give you some orientation (N, E, S, W). The circular displays were acting up when we visited, so they probably have some bugs to work out, but the idea is neat. It was fun to watch planes and helicopters flying below you since you're so high up. You can see everything from the Statue of Liberty to the Empire State building and the surrounding tri-state area.A lot of the gift shop stuff is over-priced but worth looking at to see if anything catches your eye. The food at the cafe was over-priced as well but was to be expected ($5 for a bottle of water). The food quality however was good, and had a decent variety of offerings.Although you have to enter at a certain time, you are not required to leave at a certain time. We spent around 2 hours wandering around and eating, but when we were leaving our keepsake photo wasn't ready (it was digital, not sure of the hold up). We spent about another 10 minutes waiting for them to try to get our photo (the couple we went with didn't have to wait at all). Even with the wait, they would not reduce the price at all, and we didn't like the photo itself, so we opted to not buy it."

It is an impressive view plus the ride up the elevator and the presentation when you arrive at the observatory add to the experience. We didn't, but you can rent a tablet in the observatory to assist you in identifying buildings, bridges, islands, etc. I think the cost was $15. We wanted to take the subway, for $2.75, the E line will drop you off a couple blocks from the building. One World and the 911 Museum are a \"Must See\"."

It's another 15-30 minutes before you get inside the elevator, so now we've been here a bit under two hours just standing in line. Meanwhile, anyone who arrived late got pushed right to the front of the line. So the lesson is, buy your tickets for early, then show up whenever. The elevator is a very cool ride up, but you are forced to sit through a Disneyfied video with a cheesy 'a-ha!' moment at the end before you can see the view. The glass is filthy with fingerprints. And, to top it off, they block your cell service once you enter the tower. The only way to text, share photos, whatever, is by paying $20 for a wireless pass, as though the tickets aren't overpriced as is. And expect long lines getting out. Do Top of the Rock instead."

This time around, we swapped out the former for One World Observatory instead. We pre-booked for Wednesday morning and made our way there on the Subway from our hotel near Times Square. The nearest subway stop was Cortlandt Street, however because of the different entrances to the station, it was a bit difficult to find at first (but not as hard as finding the Transit Museum in Brooklyn). Once through security, there is a large screen that shows how many visitors are showing up at One World Observatory that day, how many international, which international country the most visitors are coming from, etc. Then you pass through an area on the foundations the center is built upon. Next is the simulated elevator ride up (going up, it recreates the formation of Manhattan from when the island was nothing but greenery whereas going down, it represents a spiral down from the top of the tower and back into the base and starting point). Beyond the elevator is a short presentation (mostly just showing parts of New York) that opens and reveals the view. Then you exit out to the main deck. Don't bother about the virtual iPad that they were selling since not only is the fee steep, but also it is better to just focus on the actual view rather than the virtual one on the screen (which there were lots of people using) unless you are a first time visitor to New York. Anyways, the views are quite different than the ones from Top of the Rock and Empire State Building since you are a lot closer to the water. You have views looking down on the Statue of Liberty, Jersey City, the Fulton area (around City Hall) and lower Manhattan and in addition to having the Empire State Building in the view, all three of the major airports are also visible from this deck. Viewing over Manhattan Harbor, all of the boat and ferry traffic and numerous helicopters can be seen down below along with the cruise ships (Queen Mary 2 was in port at Brooklyn that day) and the cargo ships that come in and out. All of the bridges are clearly visible from this deck (though the Queensborough Bridge is only partially visible to the north. Other than the views, there is also the SkyPortal which is a virtual screen (similar to a glass floor) that has an aerial view of the traffic that is moving down below. After the observation deck and gift shop, it is back to the elevator heading down and back out again. If you have the time, don't forget Wall Street (where you can see the Stock Exchange building and some of the other historic financial related structures) and the Staten Island Ferry (where you can get great views of the harbor, Statue of Liberty and container ports all without paying a fee) both of which are in the same area."

You enter through a fairly stringent security check point where you follow a staged underground passage simulating the bedrock on which all the Manhattan skyscrapers are built. The lift to the top is an experience in itself as it simulates the growth of New York from the early settler\u2019s through the early skyscrapers up to present day. At the top you watch a presentation about New York projected onto what you think is a wall but it\u2019s really a screen which lifts slowly to reveal the view to midtown. It\u2019s brilliantly handled and it really takes your breath away. After that you\u2019re free to explore on your own; there\u2019s a regular presentation but the real star is the view. We were lucky as it was a crystal clear summer day with the perfect azure blue sky.

The downside was that there was a heat haze which obscured the view. However as we were there about an hour, this did clear slightly. Having visited the twin towers, this was a really emotional experience. The journey in the lift was really interesting and I would have liked to have spent longer doing that, but also the mini exhibitions once at the viewing gallery were excellent. A big difference between the twin towers and the freedom tower was that you are inside at all times. This does feel safer, although it does obscure your pictures. The footprints of the twin towers, must be seen and give you the opportunity to pay your respects to all those lost during 9/11. Altogether this is excellent value for money, but I would have really appreciated having my printed ticket (purchased in advance) for a proper ticket to be kept as a souvenir. A must do in New York."

It takes maybe 15 minutes to get in and there are no restrooms until you've done so, so be warned :) The elevators up and down and quite incredible for the foresight someone had on making the journey interesting, although as you're standing right next to the walls its a not quite as amazing I'm sure as if you wever in the centre of the evelator alone. Once up there's a 360 degree view of Manhattan, and I'm sure much much further on a nice day (ours was cloudy so you could see maybe 5-10 miles). The $15 for the ipad augmented reality device seemed a rip-off and should be inlcuded in the already hefty entrance price!

If you want to go up to the top of WTC it'd take about 1 hr if you haven't pre-booked the time slot online, tickets $32; or get express ticket for $54 (but still have the 20 min queue). The visit itself once you are at the top, it takes you around 20 minutes to do a lap with the 360 degrees view of NY. We were lucky it was a crystal clear day and we could see 60+ miles away, around 2pm. Manhattan et all, very spectacular and always entertaining.Looking down from the WTC to where the old twin towers used to be is quite a feeling, if you had the chance to go up them before 2001 - which I did in 1991. The fountains they have put in their memory are quite special too. Not many, or any, US flags but just dark colours and water flowing and all the names... enough to remember. I couldn't help but look up in the air and wonder what people in the towers must have felt when those planes came their way... RIP.I'll probably go back again one day next time I am back."

So trying to sit or stand quietly taking in the amazing views with a bit of contemplation of why we were there ( after all there is a memorial directly below after all) and there was the noise of these iratating machines and also the extra infomation being yelled out from the stands either side of the viewpoint ... not necessary. The shop was also on the same floor space so a crowded bottle neck when there needed to be more space really. We had been caught out with our plans and needed something to eat, food completely over priced $24 for a cheese toastie and chicken panini. Nothing special and you couldn't even sit down to eat.

I won't spoil the experience for others but the elevator ride was an experience in itself & so fast! Once up to the viewing deck we were ushered into a narrow area for a short show which was brilliant and really well done. After that we were free to observe the view, and what a fabulous view it is! There are so many amazing views from rooftops all across manhattan, but this vantage point is unique being right at the bottom of Manhattan Island. I would really recommend this to everyone, it's a must do. The elevator ride down was very fast another surprise experience too.

As others have said, the lift is great. But once you arrive at the top, there is plenty of room and lots of space. You are not outside, but there is plenty of room, lots of window space, and it's so much less hectic than either Top of the Rock or the Empire State. Being lower Manhattan, there are good views of the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Greenwich/Soho etc, as well as being able to see a long way into New Jersey and Long Island (I admit a nerdy enjoyment from being able to spot, and watch planes taking off and landing at all three airports!)

Fantastic views, of course, but the most pleasant surprise was the very cool elevators that give you a virtual trip through time on your way up and down. Only complaint really is the crowd can be a bit much, and they try and force you to take one of those stupid bluescreen pictures on the way in."

This iconic building constructed near the original twin towers is the tallest building in the western hemisphere. It has 101 floors. The tickets are available on online (though priced high @ 32 dollars per adult). The best time is to visit in the evening hours.The whole visit is well organised including the security check.The presentation is well done.Most impressive is the option of taking a ipad (of course costs few dollars) which is very useful to listen to the details of every iconic building in new york when viewed fro the observatory @ 101st floor.The souvenir shop is of course very expensive.Over all a great expereince."

Forget the Empire State Building and Rockefeller - the best views in New York are from the One World Trade Center !The whole entry process was very organised - pay by card at the handheld stations outside or by cash inside the lobby. The times for entry are staggered so as to keep the flow of people at a nice level. You enter the lifts as a group - and the lift itself is an excellent start to the experience. Super-fast and a great deal of thought has gone into the design. (no spoilers) On leaving the lift the group enter an area showing scenes of NYC on a large screen .... with a nice twist at the end (again no spoilers)The views from the observations platforms are STUNNING ! There is little more to be said about it ! We chose to have a drink in the bar - seated at the 'side bar' with incredible views. Its so cool to see Helicopters below you and Planes feeling 'not far' above you. We stayed for a couple of glasses of wine enjoying the views, and daughter enjoying the free wifi :)We did do the Rockefeller another day and, whilst it does allow you to see Central Park from there and there is opportunity to go outside which is nice - for me the only place to go is the One World Trade Center !"

We had a timed entry which you can't change but beats the queues so worth booking on line before arrival.The start of the tour taking you into the elevator to ascend is great and the elevator experience is outstanding (seeing NYC being built over the last few hundred years) and the See Forever theatre presentation is also well done. The views from the observatory floors are breath-taking and you can rent an iPad to show you more detail and history of each site you can see on the 360 degree observatory.The reason why I scored 4 rather than 5 stars is that the cafe at the observatory is very expensive & you have to stand at tables & there is nowhere to sit. Bearing in mind sight-seeing can take a lot out of your feet & energy levels, a seat to have a coffee would have been very welcomed! The ride down in the elevator is equally enthralling.Worth a visit and a nice way to look at the future of the area after all that has happened in the past."

It is a pity that some of the best view over NYC is blocked by some of their activity centers.To cost is rather high but that is NY style, with 3 grown up kids it is quite an investment, but worth it.The elevator ride is just great - try it."

It was mid August and we only had to wait in line for twenty minutes, so unless you know EXACTLY when you are going to be there, no need to book in advance. (Advance tickets are for 15-minute slots). Quite a bit of security (understandable) but well done and all very friendly staff. Very clever lift going up......showing the site over the years and how it has changed.....but almost goes a bit too fast. There is a lot of touristy stuff at the top and they make you go through the shop and cafe to get to anywhere....but I guess that is par for the course. The views themselves are amazing and you get a wonderful 360 degree view of Manhattan Island and everything around it. It is all enclosed - guess health and safety won't allow anything open air - so not like the Emoire State.......but the fab thing is that because of where it is, you can look all the way up the Island. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting as a tourist. Not too expensive either."

The trip was timed and the access to the observatory floors was well managed and efficient without long lines to stand in. We went through an airport style security screening and then we were whisked up to the observation floors in a multi-media style express lift. You are shown a short video in the lobby of the observation floors. Then the screens lift to offer you the first breath taking views of the Manhattan skyline. You walk through to the 360 degree viewing floor where you are free to walk around taking in the view and taking photographs/videos. An iPad style tablet device can be hired to inform you what you are looking at with augmented reality style graphics. Simply hold the tablet up in line with your viewpoint to see exactly what is in your line of sight. There is also a cafe/restaurant available but sadly the cafe part does not have any seating - its all stand up tables. This is ok for the able bodied but anyone who needs to sit down due to any disability will struggle. Restrooms and a gift shop are also available. The viewing experience is totally indoors and therefore the view is through glass, unlike the Empire State building where the viewing platform is outdoors. The experience is excellent and the views amazing (subject to weather conditions of course). The descent is also fun in the multi-media lift cars that display video images on their internal walls to enhance the trip down the WTC Tower 1."

However if you like to take memories with you in the form of photographs it is a real pity the designers did not put more thought into managing the reflections caused by the glass in the viewing area. All photos are spoiled by excessing reflections. Next time we will reverse our decisions and visit One World in daylight and the other two at night."

It costs about $32 each, for the cheapest ticket, and for this you must book a time slot on-line in advance of arriving.Once through security, you're taken to an elevator. This takes you up to the top very quickly but you don't notice the speed as you're looking at the videos around you of New York being built through the years. It's a great idea. When you come out you're on the 102nd floor. The way you get to see you're first glimpse of the view is brilliant and took us by surprise!You're then eventually taken to the observatory with 360 degree views of New York City and it really is an unbelievable view. Having done the Empire State and the Rockefeller it was really nice to look at Manhattan from a different viewpoint. There is no time limit whilst you're up there and you can walk around and take photos as much as you like before heading back to the elevators. Taking photos though can prove to be a bit tricky due to the reflections off the glass windows and people smearing hand prints all over them through out the day. The best time to go up in my opinion is early evening as you'll then get daytime, sunset and night time views of New York City!"

At the bottom you see a picture of New York when the early settlers took hold and as you rise, so does the time scale and the view.There are 102 floors to the top and the start to finish journey is less than 60 seeconds.As the doors open at the top you are faced with a large screen that tells the WTC story - at the end of the film the screen rises and reveals a 360 degree view of Manhattan. At the top you can hire ipads with apps that points out places of interest where you look down - interactive.There is a food area by the observation deck and stools that you sit on, eat and enjoy the view - it looked a bit pricey, but was good of quality.Overall, you cant go to NYC and not go here, you cant help imagine what it was like to be at that height on that fatefull day and remember those that died."

Also smudges on the windows so they need some cleaning.

With this ticket I was able to go straight to the front of the queue and also clear security via the VIP access lanes rather than standing in another long queue to go through the standard security lanes and I was in an elevator heading up the observation deck in around 15 minutes of arriving.Even the elevator ride was an attraction in itself, speeding to the observation deck in around 1 minute and with a visual display going on across 3 walls of the elevator to keep you entertained on the journey up. I was lucky and visited on a sunny and clear day and the views were amazing, with great views all across the city and for miles beyond. The only thing which was a disappointment was the photographs I took, which due to the windows and the sun shining on the observation deck had the reflections of myself and the other people around me in the pictures. So I was majorly disappointed with the photos once I looked at them afterwards and felt a later visit to the Empire State Building which has a fence rather than glass window observation deck gave much better quality of photo."

It costs about $35 per person, but you get an incredible elevator ride and an amazing view, The E train got us there and back quite easily. Watch out for the peddlers, they are not too pushy, but you can't avoid them. We snuck in through the back way by the Port Authority. There's an amazing empty hallway there that leads right past all the lines if you already have a ticket. Food is nice looking at the small cafe, but it was expensive. Nice picture was taken but it cost $30 for a hard copy with an internet post, $20 for the picture only. Lots of international visitors there, I heard at least 4 languages I couldn't figure out and several I could. They have an IPAD for rent that has about 7 languages and english that shows what you are looking at. All in all, a great experience."

The elevator ride was amazing; we wished we could have gone up and down again! The views are definitely spectacular but the negatives were:1) The iPad experience wasn't worth it. It's not interactive or realtime so very limited. You could probably find an app that's better.2) There is not one single place to sit unless you want to go to the bar where a cocktail costs $20. NOT ONE. We were tired from having visited the museum and the memorial and just wanted to rest and take in the views, but no way to do so. Even where they sell food at a concession there were no seats!"

Also they have iPad's to use for $15 which tells you what you are viewing. I'm sure there is some kind of an app for that which is prob free. Also while you're there the 9-11 memorial shouldn't be missed. That museum charges admission but we didn't go due to time constraints. Enjoy!"

We ordered wings, ribs & truffle fries - the wings and ribs were cold (likely sitting waiting for an order as they arrived very quickly) - being sold to - prior to entering the observatory you are given a \"pitch\" about purchasing access to a tablet that uses augmented reality to give you info on NYC. The tablet looked great - however - I felt like I was being sold a time share.- view - the view is amazing & it is great to look back on NYC toward the Empire state building, Chrysler building etc. However, the reflective nature of the observatory makes taking photos difficult (but on the upside it allows you to enjoy the view without worrying about photos). The observatory at the Top of the Rock is much better - great to be able to go outside and get a view above glass/ screens"

Be sure to be there on time because tickets are timed, and there can be long queues. There is a process that needs to be followed, bags checked, lines for the elevator etc. so it's better to plan for a longer visit than expected."

The day before the scheduled reservation I received an email from One World (that I happened to see pop up on my phone - I was already on vacation and enjoying other parts of the city) that stated \"due to a private event, my reservation would need to be rescheduled for another time\". Why would they allow a private event to be scheduled during the same time other people had already reserved tickets resulting in forfeits (no refunds were offered) and the inconvenience of rescheduling? Luckily, I had planned on spending most of the day in that area so as the email instructed I went to One World to pick another time - it said anytime before 9pm. So we arrive around 2pm and are told we need to get in line to buy tickets even though we already had tickets that they canceled. After about 45min in line we make it to the ticket counter and are then told the next available time was 830pm. We had no other choice but to accept the new tickets. As the ticket counter worker handed us our new tickets she said, \"you are only allowed to make changes this one time\". We were in disbelief at that point haha. We ended up using those 5 hours to get lost in lower Manhattan and see what we could and had a good time. Once we got up to the observation deck that night the views were amazing, but I was also trying to take great photos with my cool new camera which was nearly impossible because of the interior light glare on the windows. Ugh. Next time we will be going to Top of the Rock instead."

As you ride the elevator up, there are screens that show you how NYC changed from the 1800s till now. The views are amazing. The only thing that sucks is you need to take photos through the class panes so sometimes there's a glare but either than that it's beautiful.

Once you get to the top you watch a quick video and then get a sneak peek of the view as the screen lifts to reveal the view. But then they force you to wait in line for a green screen picture - they really need to allow people to walk around that and not torture them to wait for it even If you don't want the picture. That said it's a great view and you can walk 360 around the observation level to see everywhere.

Talk about ears popping (going up and down)! During that elevator ride, pictures change on the walls depicting how New York City has changed over the past several hundred years. It was quite an experience! The observation deck is on the 104th floor, with glass windows all around. The views are spectacular! The only problems were the crowds of people, competing for prime locations near the windows to take pictures and the hand prints on the windows from visitors, blurring the view. Also, it was a little hazy outside when we were there, so it was not possible to get clear pictures. One other problem was the large crowds of people who parked themselves on the ledges around the glass windows and were not always cooperative about letting others get close enough to take pictures. A suggestion would be to not allow people to sit on the ledges and to require that they keep moving rather than staying in one place for long periods of time. We paid $30 per person to go up to the Observation Deck, and that was a reduced rate. Be prepared to experience large crowds of people, and all that goes along with that scenario."

World Trade Center encompasses several buildings built at the site of the former World Trade Center Buildings destroyed in the 9/11 attacks. With One World Trade Center and inside the One World Trade Center lift to the Observatory level, now Two World Trade Center, the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, the World Trade Center has a positive, energetic vibe with the rebuilding at the same site. With tree lined sidewalks, fountains and art, this is a beautiful area in Lower Manhattan. If you're planning the visit the Observatory level at One World Trade Center or the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, buy your tickets before your visit to avoid lines. Or, if you want to ensure good weather and great views from the One World Trade Center Observatory level, wait and buy same-day tickets early in the morning after you know the weather will be good. Easy to navigate to the World Trade Center complex via the subway hub or taxi, this area still has a lot of continuing construction. However, NYC is ready for visitors, including those with mobility concerns. We found restaurants, street corner food truck vendors (a NYC staple for a quick bite to eat), and coffee shops. The World Trade Center complex is vibrant, safe and the spirit of this area is energizing. Very highly recommended."

We found the staff to be helpful and friendly and, although it wasn't the cheapest activity, where are you going to ever see views like it?"

From the moment you enter the building and going through security up the elevator and then the presentation after which the veil is lifted and the views are just spectacular. The whole observation deck is well laid out and you can get your 360 degree views. We got there before sunset and it is a great view to see the city transform from day to night. The only point of criticism would be that people tend to sit in the windows so sometimes hard to get a good shot also because of the many finger smudges on the windows. Definitely a worthwhile place to visit."

The view from the top is amazing, it speaks for itself but is not allowed to because of a desire to explain everything with presentations. Ignore these, just enjoy the view.

I booked the tickets online in advance and highly recommend to do so. It saves lots of time for waiting outside. Our group had about 8-9 people, got there on time and got in the check-in area right away. The elevator is pretty fast and looks cool with the information on the wall. I love the new design on the top floor and how they provide information to visitors which is very useful. However, I wish they had the opening section as Empire State Bldg that we could go out to see the city and take pictures without any obstacles. Other than that, it is very amazing to visit the place."

I've visited both the Empire State Observatory and Top of the Rock before, and I'd say this runs the latter close whilst absolutely obliterating the Empire State. The price is reasonable and the elevator ride up might just be the best part, showing you how the NYC skyline has changed over the years. From there, you are moved into a theatre where the best part of the entire experience occurs, which I won't spoil. Afterwards, the observatory is really fantastic and even though you can't go outside (no open-air space like at the Rockefeller) it is nonetheless an truly immersive experience. Highly recommended."

Not only are the views great, but overall the experience itself is just fantastic. From the beginning you are emersed in a story of how the building was constructed and the views of the people involved and what it means to them. The journey to the top is also good, with LED screens showing a timelapse view of the outside from where you are. When you get to the top there is another short video followed by the main event, a 360 degree view of the city from 100 floors up which is just breathtaking! It is also really spacious with lots of room to move around. The LED screens in the elevator also show a different virtual view as you go back down. For the same price as the Empire State, you get a lot more and there is much less queing!The only downside for me was that although it wasn't very busy at the time, we were rather crammed into the elevators and video experience and this means you couldn't really see half of what were on the screens. I would be happy have waited 5 minutes longer to have less people in the elevator and video.Although I would definitely say to do both the One World and Empire State (we did One World in the day and ES at night), if you only have the time or budget for one, I would recommend the One Word Observatory. The price is the same but the views are better, the overall experience is better, there is more space to move around and we found the queue time at all points to be much less.A MUST DO!!"

The lift ride was amazing and for anyone fearful of heights, there was such an interesting media display in the lift and just after to distract you! We spent a good hour or so here wandering around a couple of times and ate at the cafe as we'd missed breakfast for the early queue. There were some characters doing talks on interesting parts of NY to visit.

I've lived in jersey all my life and am a frequent visitor to NYC. My son attended school at PACE and I have family who have called NYC home for many years. The tragedy of 9/11 hit very close and watching the new tower go up and the memorial being built was a constant reminder of that time for me. It always made me upset so I wasn't sure how I would be visiting. I was absolutely stunned. The views from the tower observatory are breathtaking. Floor to ceiling plate glass windows allow you to see a 360 degree view without a problem. You realize that you truly are standing in the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. Tickets are timed and sold in 15 minutes intervals. They have you line up based on your time and have it down to a science. You can buy tickets online in advance but they have you take a screen shot of your tickets on your phone because you tend to lose service when you go downstairs to start the tour. I would recommend buying in your mobile rather than waiting in line there. We actually didn't have tickets when we arrived but rather than wait on line I simply bought them on my mobile right there and got on line. Not sure how the tickets sell during busier times but we had no problem getting tickets right then and there. It was still crowded but they can accommodate fairly large crowds. They do try to sell you an upgrade for $15 which is an iPad that is integrated to the views so you can tell what you are looking at and get more info. This is probably a nice enhancements for those unfamiliar with the area. For me it was fun to point out all the sights seen from so high up. They have a restaurant and a gift shop inside as well as a live person talking about NYC tourist sights to give people some additional insight. I thought they did an awesome job and I would highly recommend a day trip to include the tower, the 9/11 memorial and a ferry ride to the Statue of Liberty/ Ellis Island. Would be a fun filled day of touring. TriBeCa also has some awesome restaurants.. Just saying.."

We were glad we did because there was little wait time, and it was not crowded then. The elevator ride up lasted less than a minute and surrounded us with an unforgettable time-lapse video of Manhattan\u2019s history from 1500 to present time. The views of New York City and the surrounding area were absolutely spectacular there! Plenty of friendly staff members were available to answer questions and share stories of the city too. My personal favorite was a young lady named Tauren who did a wonderful audience participation presentation within a multi-screen ring of HD video monitors with gesture recognition technology. She was enthusiastic and fun! Thanks, Tauren, for adding so much to our fantastic visit at One World Observatory."

To see this engineering marvel rise from the ashes to how it stands today was a special privilege. The views from 360' are spectacular and one can even see the ellipse of the earth if the day is clear. It would be sad if the policies aren't changed when tickets are purchased in advance as suggested for a rainy, dreary day. The view wouldn't be worth it. Another small low point is the photos taken of all who visit and then have the opportunity to purchase. Unfortunately, the snaps aren't allowed to be previewed beforehand and we weren't so keen on our group shot, but did purchase as a memento of the occasion. The staff members chosen to work the elevators or various spots of interest are great at their jobs for a facility only open three short months!Best wishes for continued success but anfewmchanges might be necessary, ie. The photos...."

The elevator ride itself was worth some of the admission and the presentation you witness prior to being 'released' onto the observation deck left me in tears. Kudos to those folks that created these special touches!! The view is, of course, spectacular! Lots to do and no rush to circle around and leave. It's nice to be inside out of the elements and with plenty of walking and standing space, as opposed to the Empire State Building. Although we did not use this service, you can rent an i-pad that will instruct you on what you're viewing if you're not familiar with the New York City area. I saw many folks using these. This was very memorable experience and I recommend it!!"

Express entry pass: Its worth spending 10 bugs more it will only take you 10 minutes to get in.+ The elevators and Theatre: Great idea to show the history of Manhattan.+ The view: It is 1776 ft high, it must be a great view. (But you pay for it so it's not a real plus point.) - Time to wait: There is no possibility to get around those horrible touristy pictures in front of a green screen, even though you don't want it. During that wait and another 5 minute wait, where they are trying to sell you an IPad that has an augmented reality screen for another 10 USD, you can't even see the skyline, because all the windows are covered. People should either decide to buy the IPad at the ground or be allowed to skip it.- Information Desks: shooting photos with the magnificent north view is barely possible, because they put some sort of information screen with people talking about New York, that will basically make it impossible to catch the best view of the skyline."

If you are familiar with the view from the original WTC it was obscured by the narrow windows and structural girders. Now there are wide open views of the city and surrounding areas. I dislike the placement of the gift shop in the midst of the sightseeing experience and there is no open air experience like the one the original offered. The price is high ($32) and if you wanted to enjoy a meal or cocktail on a whim you would still have to pay the sightseeing fee of 32.00."

And the elevator ride is cool with great video presentation. However, But with all the marketting hype and salesmanship, other things were disappointing. Buying tickets from a mobile phone was difficult as app or website was not well suited for mobile use. Once purchased, it says it offers mobile delivery of tickets but that doesnt happen, you have to take a screen shot of the bar code of each ticket - it s not clear how to get to further bar codes for more than one ticket and you better be able to display bar codes when you get to the entry point or else they send you to Guest Services then back to end of line. Bummer. They should know, most tourists dont have access to a printer on vacation.. Also, disapointing was all there hype about the great video presentations - they sucked and they dont let you walk past them to avoid wasting time. The other disappointing hype was \"three floors of 360 degree views\" that was a lie. The architects and interior designers who designed this space were idiots - its terribly poorly designed. The elevator lets you off on 102nd floor which has 80% of windows blocked off from your view and 10% hidden behind the earlier mentioned sucky presentation screen which they open for all of 30 seconds before forcing you to leave the room and goto the 101st floor. This level has 60% of the windows blocked by restaurants, balconies, kitchen equipment and other obstacles - few if any areas close enough to the windows to get a good view. The 100th floor is the only level where you can really get up close to the glass to get a good view or a good picture. However, with so many people crowded to one level, people just camp out and sit in the best spots for hours. and still 10% of windows blocked by advertising displays. This could be fixed by them building raised floor areas toward the interior so you can see over the heads of those who hog the windows in the front. Or if they let visitors near the windows on the 101 and 102 floors it wouldnt be so bad. Again, overall, a good view and a decent value for $32 but they hype this as a world class tourism experience and I dont think its world class at all. The Empire State Building is a better experience."

I cannot miss the twin towers in countless movies made before 9/11, and the missing twins are noticeably absent in the skyline, but now with One World Trade Center standing tall and complete, the pride of the NYC skyline is back in the sky. Only one question I have is why the building was not created higher to beat the height of Dubai and other tall skyscrapers ?"

We went up at night and it was a stunning view but I think the daytime view would have been better. The area around the tower wasn't really lit up like downtown Manhattan (so basically not the night views you get from the Empire State Building). The worst part of trying to get a picture at night is the glass reflects the interior building lighting and no matter what you do it ends up in the picture. Overall I love what this building stands for. To me it symbolizes growth and the way of the future. It shows that we will overcome the 9/11 tragedy and rise up for a bigger/better future."

Unfortunately you only get to see the 47 seconds of the wall you are facing. That is why I only give this a 3 rating. On the elevator you see NYC over a period of 100 years, this video should be available somewhere else on the tour as you can only ride the elevator one time and I would have liked to see the other walls (views of NYC in the other directions). Third- The view at the top- spectacular! We did rent the IPad to help identify what we are looking at but it is difficult to navigate/sync as you are standing and around other people, there is no place sit and stabilize.

I had purchased a 5pm time slot to go up and I was happy that I did as it was chaos outside.(friends went a week later on a Friday afternoon and there wasn't anyone around) We did visit soon after its first opening and at peak school holidays so it was to be expected. We went in and quickly went to a lift which had a very interesting video around the building of Manhattan and the building. All in 60 seconds. The views were amazing up top and we got some great photos awesome views of Liberty and the other way Empire State. Well worth the visit for around $30 per person."

We knew we wanted a skyscraper experience and decided on One World over Top of the Rock and Empire State because of 60-second elevator to the top time, newness of the building, and location at tip of island so we could see the river almost all the way around the observation deck. We were not disappointed.I had read a lot about madness of trying to get tickets at Empire State, and was therefore delighted when mere seconds after I arrived at the foot of One World and beheld the steady crowd of people approaching to get in line, a staff person asked if we would like to pay by credit card instead of waiting to go pay inside at main cash. We said yes, and 30 seconds later were being ushered into the line about to enter the building and go downstairs to the elevators. The Elevator experience is AWESOME, stand where you can see the walls and have your camcorder ready to go. Spectacularly creative display and singularly powerful history lesson (also on the way down). We chose not to rent the iPad that identified landmarks and didn't feel we missed anything. At first we were going to purchase the photo that they make everyone pose for on entry, but the line to pay was too long so we opted out.Loved One World, don't regret a single penny spent on this family experience."

On a clear August day the view from the One World Observatory was magnificent - we could see for miles in all directions .After entering and being directed downstairs we were processed through the security checkpoint. Some people had evidently never done that before. We then found ourselves in faux surroundings made to look like 450 million years ago, bed rock Manhattan.An elevator zoomed us 102 floors in less than a minute. They offer a wonderful surround movie which took us from the past to the present. Too bad we could not really enjoy it, since our noses were pressed against the elevator wall.We were then directed along the rail of a screening room where we saw another multimedia show of Manhattan. We were on an end - center is the place to see best.We were then directed to stand and wait for yet another presentation, which we skipped.Here is the problem with the observatory: there is no panoramic view. Window mullions every 5 feet prevent a wide view. Also the angles prevent good shots of the Empire State Bldg and midtown. The view down to the 9/11 Memorial is so steep one pool was out of our view.There are also two live presentation areas that further block the view and create noise and congestion.So I'm glad I went to the tallest building in North America. I won't go back."

The view is stunning but depends of course on the weather so I would not book up weeks in advance. We turned up on a clear day in mid July and queued for little more than ten minutes before getting our tickets. There's no point spending loads of money without the guarantee of a good view.The lift up is amazing and rockets up through over a hundred floors at 23mph. The walls of the lift are screens showing a history of New York with a very brief reference to 9/11. Personally I found the speed of the lift and the thought of the distance it was covering quite unnerving and I felt quite wobbly on exiting at the top not least because you don't immediately get the distraction of the amazing view. As for the view - well it lives up to the billing and with a crane of the neck you can see the 9/11 Memorial far down below and looking tiny. Utterly thought-provoking. Totally moving. Collywobbles aside I would definitely go again,"

The short talk is followed by an impactful reveal of the view. You can pay for \"interactive\" iPads to tell you what is what but they are not truly interactive, ie they do not follow where you point exactly (as they were purported to do) and they only contain limited information about a few selected sites. Maybe they are working on this?As a tourist, I wanted to know about far more than was offered. There are talks from guides and you can ask them to pick out different aspects to talk about and they talk to a whole group about that subject such as Wall Street. I think this information would have been better presented in a truly interactive way by personal phones etc. The gift shop was full of expensive stuff and not much in the way of a postcard! The cafe was disappointingly limited in its offering and we struggled to find something light for lunch. The toilets were odd, multisex and confusing to visitors. They missed a trick here, compared to eg The Shard in London where they are a feature with clear glass floor to ceiling!We stayed up there for a couple of hours, it really was worth the $32 each.

I wasn't rushed and was able to take my time. The gift shop was good but found that the prices where quite high.Dinner at the ONE restaurant was amazing. Yes it was $84 but it was a 4 course meal. You did get to choose what you wanted. I found the portion sizes for me where perfect. The staff were very helpful and polite. I would definitely go for dinner again. I do not think you should have to pay to go up to the observatory if you are having dinner though."

I am probably in the minority here, but I have a big problem with money being made on the misery of the 9/11 victims. It is true that the views from the observatory are great on a clear day, but a look at the type of merchandise on sale at the gift shop is truly nauseating. This is true of the gift shop items on sale at the 9/11 museum as well. The best part of this attraction is the elevator ride up during which a visual history of Manhattan island is recreated on the elevator walls."

When we did get there, we went to the front of the line and were escourted down the stairs and straight to the elevators. Awesome! Make sure to have your iPhone video rolling when you are going up the elevator and also coming back down in the end. There is so much going on- on those elevator rides! Make sure to capture it. Also, have your video going when they take you into an orientation room (at the beginning) and then all the walls GO UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU and you see the AMAZING NEW YORK VIEW!!! We did not eat at the restaurants as we had heard the food was just ok and quite expensive. Walked around and took in the views. There are certain places you can stand to get excellent photos without the glass reflections showing up in them. We found them. There is also a gift shop up there for momentos.

We went early in the morning which is definitely the best time to go ss there were absolutely no lines. We bought general admission tickets the day before and got in very quickly. If you are going in the morning, there is no reason to buy the more expensive VIP tickets. Waste of money!You have to go through the usual security and so on. The elevator ride is really interesting as is the initial welcome to the observatory deck. From there, unfortunately, the experience is dampened by sales pitches. First, there is a sales pitch to buy iPad information tablets. Again, no need if you have Google maps and you can easily map out what everything is in a few moments. Then, they ask you to take a photo which can be purchased at the end. You are being shuffled around so that you don't quite know what is happening. It is quite annoying. Then you walk by the restaurant and then finally get to go to the observation deck. Some of the best views are obscured by carnival like salesman trying to sell you other tours around New York City. Also, the sky deck is supposed to show you how everything looks down below as if if you were to look straight down, is actually just a video feed, or even perhaps a loop, of the city and street view down below. I thought this was going to be similar to the CN Tower in Toronto where you actually stand on Lucite/plexiglass and see down to the street below. I must admit I found it surprising given that this was just completed that they could have incorporated this feature!Overall, the views are amazing and a poignant reminder of what occurred on this hallowed ground. Still quite worth visiting despite these negatives."

Okay, you go way, high up and see amazing views, however the most amazing things about this place are the elevator rides and the way you are introduced to the observatory once you get up there. On the way up every wall of the elevator turns into a multimedia presentation that begins with Manhattan before buildings, then grows and builds before your eyes as the elevator reaches the top at an amazing speed. Except for the ear popping you can barely tell you're moving. Once you reach the top your are herded into a long narrow hall with a black wall in front of you. Okay....spoiler alert. Stop reading if you want to be surprised when you go there. Once everyone is in the room another multimedia presentation is shown on the wall of places around New York City. it's very impressive. Then the walls go black and begin to raise in sections revealing an unbelievable view of New York City and beyond! The observatory has souvenirs (naturally) and a restaurant. On the way down you get another multimedia presentation in the elevator showing NYC in the near future when all the new buildings are built (I think, because i was taking pictures of it when it was running). Once at the observatory you have the option of renting an ipad that you could use to figure out what buildings you are looking at. I had to try it even though I knew most of the famous structures. However, I turned it back in after a few minutes, because it got in the way of my picture taking. It cost $15 to rent. Before you go you need to get tickets online, though I guess you can get tickets at the site, though you may be limited to when you can go up. Even if you get tickets ahead of time you will still be waiting in line for awhile. However, you can pay a little more and get a ticket that will put you in the front of the line at the chosen time, or pay even more money for the flex pass that allows you to jump in the front of the line at any time during that day. The flex pass cost $64. Of course, be prepared to go through lots of security. One more thing, if you are waiting in the long line you will get to see a presentation about the building of the tower while you are moving along in the line."

I came directly to the ticket cashier and in 5 minutes I was in the allready in an elevator. There the fun part begins, the ride itself and video support are amazing. On the top the views are incredible and you also have one hour of free wifi (no GSM signal, too high above the ground). I took a lot of pictures and it was definitely worth every dollar.

There was no high pressured sales and the staff were without fail efficient and friendly.Plenty of room to view from all around behind glass windows. The views are amazing, even with the slightly hazy weather we had. We were up there for just over an hour. It was getting busier by the time we left at just after 11am.We combined this with a visit to the 9/11 memorial museum and I am so glad we did the tower first as we hadn't realised how much there was to see in the museum.

The building is quite beautiful, we bought our tickets in advance, there was some confusion about where to wait if you had a ticket, that could be though that our line was there before the attraction opened - so there wasn't guidance from the very beginning. The lift ride up and down is amazing.The views are good - we went on a pretty hazy day so some parts aren't very clear. In some parts it's really hard to get a good photo of the view - the way the windows are means there's lots of glare. I'm not sure if this would change depending on the time of the day. The best view (north) is blocked by a pole and a presentation screen. This would be the perfect shot of the Empire State Building and all of Midtown. The cafe prices are crazy CRAZY! I'm hoping that some of the price point is donated to FDNY? A bottle of water is $5 (slab of 24 from Duane Reade is $7) a 'latte' is $6 (literally a nespresso pod coffee) and a sandwich was $12. Plus tax. The gift shop is just ok. You go through thorough security on the way in - I'm not sure if you can take your own water and food in. The view is good from the point of view of a different persepective of the city, however if you only had 1 week in NYC and were pushed for time, don't feel like you've missed a lot if you don't have time to go up.

The last time I stood so high in that same space was on the observation deck of one of the Twin Towers. I couldn\u2019t help but be drawn back to my previous visit as well as remembering when, about 12 years later, I saw on television the despicable acts of terrorism that brought those towers down. And so it was \u2018wondrous strange\u2019 to be standing in that space again, and to again hear the languages from all over the world spoken by my fellow visitors. I was proud for the city of New York as well as for all Americans that we\u2019d been able to build such a magnificent structure to replace \u2018our\u2019 towers. And the view is incredible; better than any other \u2018observation\u2019 view anywhere. And since the city and all the surroundings are laid out before you, there is lots and lots to see. Now they even rent iPads with a great program explaining all of the sights. I was also very impressed with the professional but friendly demeanor of the staff. I told one of them I didn\u2019t remember New Yorkers being this friendly and she said, \u2018Yeah, I guess we\u2019ve gotten soft since you were here last.\u2019 I had to tell her with a smile, \u2018Not soft, just friendly\u2019 \u2026 and she laughed. New Yorkers are still tough as diamonds in the rough, but now I guess with the polish of a much lower crime rate and the general prosperity of the city, they\u2019re letting more of their sparkle show. Going up in the One World Observatory was definitely a big highlight of my trip to New York. I could have stayed for hours, but hey, I had to get over to Katz\u2019s for lunch."

Additionally, after standing in line for 30 minutes past our time of entry, we were rushed through the observatory, and could not even get around the whole floor. We were cut off and told it was off limits, because of a \"private event\". We were very disappointed and we complained when we got to the bottom of the building. We are told they would contact us; which they never did. The money paid is NOT worth getting in the observatory in our opinion."

I couldn't quite believe this was enough time and arrived 45 mins early and was politely turned away.We went back 15 mins before and got straight into the search area, metal detectors, bag searches etc. Then there's some info screens and the wait for the elevator, which again was quick and painless. I won't got onto describe the ride or the 'show' at the top, as wouldn't want to spoil the surprise. Don't worry there plenty of time to take pictures and enjoy the view.Needless to say the views are amazing and there is a place to get food and drink at the top.

We had priority pass but the queues didn't seem too horrendous like the Top of the Rock and Empire State. Queue hopping is fun though. The elevator experience was well planned but with so many people crammed in you couldn't really see it to full effect. Mind you you would need to go in it at least 10 times to see all of it - panoramic and so you can only see one bit at a time.It does feel rather futuristic in the way you go from room to room with smiling guides following scripts and guiding you through the experience. The observation decks are on 2 levels and as others have said there is no feeling of crowding - except in lifts.The cafe is actually quite reasonably priced so we did stand and view the scene with a cup of tea and a muffin (both priced the same) no seating in the area - just tablesThere is of course a gift shop with the usual 'made else wear' items.All views are through glass but they were generally finger print free so pictures weren't too bad. Late morning visit made it tricky to do aerial view of memorial fountains as shadows cast over them.My partner found it all far too commercial and touristy - he had been up one of the twin towers and is a fan of the Empire State.iPads are utilised to offer descriptions of sites you can see which was good ( extra fee but you can share) you matched picture to skyline and clicked on name of building for a short history. There were also people telling you about the city and places to go and things to see - including advice about best cheesecake shop - juniors in Times Square - excellent advice btw!"

There are about 3 different roped lines with no explanations. When we couldn't figure out the lines of even how to get into the building to get tickets-turns out that was one of the long lines, we ordered the tickets on our phone. Simple process!When we returned in about 3 hours for our tour you got in one of the lines and went in when it was your time. We went down a flight of steps, through security, and then through some winding hallways to the elevators to the top. The experience to the top and even at the top was very Disney like. The elevator ride has videos of New York City through the years. It was pretty cool. When you go to the top you were put in another staging area to watch a film. I don't really remember what the film was about but the effect at the end was amazing. The screen looked like a cityscape and it opened up to the real view. Well done. Next you went to another regrouping area and were asked to rent an iPad that would help you identify buildings while you looked out to the city. We didn't get one, they were $15, but they did look like they were well done. Not sure if you couldn't just get an app that did the same thing, but I did see a lot of people with them.The view from the top was good. Different view than the Empire State building or Top of the Rock.Would I go again...probably not, but it was nice."

Just make sure you take plenty of pictures and you're prepared for one of the most spectacular experiences on the island. Definitely a must see for anyone."

It took seconds to get to the observation deck and amazing views 360 degrees around. Very touching when you think where you are just meters away from the original towers. So new and efficient. There's a cafe, a shop and rest rooms. A must for any trip to NYC."

Having done the one world observatory , ESB and TOFR on our recent family holiday to New York, we all felt that the one world observatory left you a bit lacking in the experience. As the one world observatory it is totally enclosed you don't get to feel the \"wind in your hair\" sensation that you get with an open observation deck such as the ESB and TOFR.We also experienced the same issue with handprints on the glass and struggled with the reflections in our photos.We didn't have any problems with queues but we got there for 9:30 in the morning.Also the price of drinks and snacks in the cafe were very expensive , I expected to pay a bit more but no where near what we paid."

We went at midday at the end of July and bought our tickets there, very small queue, very efficient lines through security and great elevator ride to the top. Remember to video the story on the walls of the elevator on the way up. Fantastic reveal moment after a 5min video about New York. The one thing that was less than efficient was the cafe in the observatory. I think I queued for nearly 20mins to get 2 sandwiches and there was 1 customer in front of me!! I then queued for another 5 minutes trying to pay for them - again there was only 1 customer in front of me. Not sure what the problem was but there was no sense of speediness at all in this cafe. It here was no where to sit either. Definitely worth doing but not sure it would warrant a repeat visit."

Even with timed tickets you queue outside, then inside, then after security, which is not a straight line so you can never see the end! When you actually do see the lifts you have another zigzag queue. The lift experience is very well done. Then when you get up to the top you queue for the theatre show!Then the selling starts!The theatre show is an ad for New York, when it's finished, the screen lifts and you see the amazing view, but before you get time to get a photo the screen comes down! Then you move to the selling of the iPad experience, with the view covered, then you go downstairs and there is the selling of photos, again with the view obscured! Finally you get to the level with the view! Which is out standing!The lack of any seating means that everyone is sitting on the window edges so the view down is hard to see! Benches set back from the window would've made it much more enjoyable for those who've queued for ages! Even the cafe didn't have seats and with water at $5 they can afford some! The selling continues with the man selling the portal and of course the gift shop!You then have to queue to get back down."

The lift experience takes you visually through both time and height. Its really well done. The views here look up Manhattan from the south, so there is much more of a mixed Manhattan, water, other boroughs and NJ view, meaning the night lights are not as impressive as the uptown observatories.If you already know a bit about New York the iPad tablets are a a waste of money.A guide book would be much more use. Similarly the VIP package doesnt seem to offer much that is different as the customer entry is pretty quick for everyoneWhat was frustrating was the poor design meant that people flows crossed at points and the glass windows need to have the handprints cleaned off them to minimise the effect of the glass on photos. The worst design flaw is placing a presentation stand in front of the north windows - the ones with the best views uptown. If this is your only observatory experience of your visit, I would recommend looking at TOTR or the Empire State as they give much more impressive views over Manhattan. However, if you've done those, then One World Observatory will give you a much better picture of how Manhattan fits into its surroundings."

We have also been to the ESB, Sears Tower, Taipei 101 and all of those landmarks offer better experiences.Here are the main things that didn't live up to expectations:- We had purchased tickets online prior to our visit for 2:30. We waited in line outside for 45 minutes before we were allowed inside. Why the wait if we had already pre-bought. Once inside, there was another line for the elevators. The final insult is a line where you are forced to listen to a sales pitch to rent an ipad to help you figure out what you're looking at. - \"Sky Portal\" was a joke. You stand on glass looking at a camera view of the street scene below while a cleaning woman mops your feet as she mops the glass. C'mon, the CN tower does it so much better with an actual glass floor looking down on the ground. - No outside observation deck. Seriously? I want to go outside and feel the wind blow through my hair. ESB does it right. - Prices at the gift shop were outrageous even by NYC standards. That said, there is one thing that OWO has that the others don't and that is a great view of Manhattan and the surrounding area. That alone saved our visit and made it worthwhile."

The elevator rockets you up 102 floors in about a minute... wow. Also,they seem to limit the number of people in the observatory to prevent it from being too crowded. And the other, an all glassed in enclosure with idiots smearing their hands and face on the glass making it a challenge to get a decent photo while dealing with glare on the windows. High ticket price, numerous queues, and then high food/drink prices seem to weigh negatively on the experience. Overall a good experience and worth doing, with the $$ caveat and photo challenges in mind."

We bought our tickets in advance for time 7:15pm. We got there 30 mins early & was allowed up. It's like going thru an airport screening to get in. I got in with a small backpack. You go thru a mini documentary walkway of workers telling their story of building the tower. Then walk pass fake bedrock that the tower is built on. There is a line for the elevators and once inside all walls of the elevator show a video of NY thru a time machine showing all the ages of NY up to when the tower was built. It's so fast it didn't feel like you were moving. You get out and walk over to an area that shows a 3 minute movie of NYC then the screen rolls up showing you the view of NY. Now you walk out and they try to get you to rent an Ipad guide (we didn't rent). From there you go downstairs to the observatory deck. It's all closed in no outside deck. This was not a good idea because the windows are filthy with finger prints and marks and if you want to take pictures you'll get reflections and distortions. You have to put your camera up to the window for decent pics. So that sucked. Its hard to get a window view because people will sit on the low window vents instead of sitting by the inside wall on the floor. So you can't get up close to take a picture with less window reflection until someone moves. They should have workers preventing window birds from sitting on the window vents. It's a nice experience but I'd rather go to the Empire State Building where its outdoors for great photos. These pics were taken from inside OWO. BTW the 9/11 memorial park is open to the public at One World Trade. We didn't eat at the cafe so no review about that."

You can't go out on the roof as you could in the old WTC. There is a schlocky gift shop and of course a bar and cafe. The whole thing is well-managed.

I was invited to the One World Observatory as part of their #1NSPIRED event, along with other artists, innovators, and visionaries from New York City. I have to say, from the moment we got out of the subway and saw the building spiraling above us, it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I've never been so amazed by an elevator ride - the history of our glorious city (and such an important piece of our national development) unfolding before us as we sped into the sky. The first glimpse of the view was so breathtaking that I laughed, then started crying. And the views from the hushed silence and wonder of the event space were life changing. I'm working on a piece of papercutting art now inspired by those views. (The food was really good too.) After a few hours, we went down a floor to the public observation deck and that was wonderful too - buzzing with activity and excitement. A completely different experience, but invigorating, where the event space experience was absolutely spiritual. I can't wait to go back and intend to plan some very special events to be held there. I'm completely in awe and humbled by the capacity of human achievement - and human resiliency - that has allowed this wonderful building to rise up out of the city and show us the wonder of New York from a completely new perspective. A must see."

Half of it is just twinkling lights of low level NJ and the view uptown wasn't much better. In my opinion, the Empire State building and 30 Rock are much, much better. You are in the middle of everything with 360 degree views. Maybe it would have been better in the day light?? It sure wasn't worth my $32.

We ate at the restaurant (not the stand up cafe). Service was friendly.

In that sense, One World Observatory is a 'does what it says on the tin' type attraction. Unsurprisingly, though, the views are breathtaking and I consider a visit should be at the top of any visitor's to-do list. However I feel more could be done to maximise the viewing experience. Call me picky but I found the dozens of window pillars slightly obstructive whilst it was difficult to capture the moment on camera as the glass seemed fairly reflective from almost any angle. It would also, in my view, benefit from a 'glass floor' type platform rather than the video-recorded alternative which is somewhat underwhelming. That said, this probably falls into the category of attractions that have to be seen first-hand and can never truly be captured on camera."

But this place seems designed to make you wait and wait and wait to see it. We booked our ticket ahead of time. Sunset would be at 8:04 p.m., so we went with the 7:30 p.m. ticket (knowing we would be arriving at 7:15 p.m., as instructed.That leaves 45 minutes to get through security and up the elevator. That shouldn't be a problem for an organization whose lone goal is to get individuals through security and up the elevator. But it didn't happen.Arrive at 7:15 and find someone to ask where you're supposed to go. Show your tickets to get in line for 5-10 minutes. Go inside and follow other people down the stairs (not that anyway made clear we were supposed to do that). Then show your ticket again to get into another line. This is the security line: take out your wallet and phone, walk through the metal detector. Somehow it took 20+ minutes, a fair stretch of which included no line movement at all. Move forward and wait in another line for the elevators. Why were only three elevators running on 8/8/15 when there was clearly a backup of people? No idea at all. That's just how it is. Eventually we all get packed into the elevators (you know that cool elevator show on the way up? It's not easy to see when the elevator is packed, especially for your kids). It's now 8:05 p.m.; we have missed the daylight and sunset views. But at least we're on the elevator ... not much longer now!Get off the elevator and wait in another line. The regretful-sounding woman telling us to wait in this line notes: \"This will be the last line you need to wait in!\" (She's lying.) Now there's going to be a three-minute movie about the facility. They'll tell you to go to the left, but ignore them and go to the right. The right is where you can leave this room ... the left is where you'll be waiting in line again.Three-minute movie is unmemorable in EVERY way. Every way whatsoever.THEN ... the BIG REVEAL! The screen (the whole width of the room - 12 or so feet tall by 60 feet wide, maybe?) lifts up to reveal a live view of the city below! A beautiful view that actually elicits cheers from the tired crowd! Beautiful!For maybe 15 seconds? Seriously - have your camera ready. If you don't, it will close before you can turn it on. And now it's time to wait in line again, as you move out of this room through the one door. Then you walk down stairs from the 102nd floor to the 101st ... where the folks are holding people up to try to explain why you should rent this ipad to see everything you're seeing and have it all explained to you (the same thing you probably already chose not to buy if you bought tickets online). Then walk down to the 100th floor (which, if I understand correctly, is not actually the 100th floor). Here you get the actual view of the city. Or, more accurately, the view of the backs of people's heads as they get a view of the city. It was packed. In numerous places, there were people sitting with their backs to the windows eating snacks while (I guess) they waited for the city to light up as darkness approached. People actually brought snacks for themselves and their kids and staked out areas for who knows how long.The interior lights made it difficult to see at some angles - and made taking pictures quite difficult. And who decided the giant circular parks portal thing was going to be right at the north side of the building - taking up the best view of the rest of the city and the Empire State Building? Take your time, though, and you'll find some beautiful views. Watch out for jerks who lean over top of your family to take their pictures (and elbow your wife in the head before insisting \"it wasn't that hard!\").Take a look at the Sky Portal, if only to shake your head that they tried to make an experience out of standing on top of TVs showing \"real-time, high-definition footage of the streets below.\"Then, get back into another line. About 15 more minutes to go downstairs. (My wife wondered whether people who paid extra to jump the lines to get up to the top also got to jump these lines - or were just left to suffer with the rest of us). And get down to the ground floor just in time to realize the World Trade Center reflecting pools close at 9 p.m., even on Saturday nights. Again, the views are great - when you see them. The overall experience here just isn't worth it, though."

After a memorable and reflective three and a half hours at the 911 Memorial and Museum, my sister and I were looking forward to visiting One World Observatory but were greatly disappointed. Several of the personnel were helpful and pleasant, several others were not. When we finally got to the Observatory floors after waiting in line, we were greeted with \"pitches\" to rent an iPad for $15 which would show one all the sights of NYC and beyond - the same sights one can see clearly when walking around the Observatory; then there was a stop to have photos taken against a painted backdrop of NYC. Since we had waited in line in the hot sun and unshaded area before entering the building, we decided to get a sandwich and cold drink at the cafe, but were told that there was no place to sit - just stand at tall tables. The restaurant was open for drinks but did not serve food at the time we were there - between 4:00 and 5:00. The walk around the Observatory floors with the magnificent views of NYC was good but again no place to sit and observe the views. Finally, on approaching the exit we passed the Observatory store selling expensive and uninspiring merchandise. I would recommend other places from which to view NYC, eg top of Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building and would not recommend One World Observatory - it is too commercial - from the entrance fee to the sales pitches inside the building.Reflecting on the original World Trade Center with its magnificent Windows on the World, it was sad to see what has taken its place."

The first part of the queue was fine - you go through security quickly. It was only then that we experienced the long and slow moving queue to the lifts. The line takes you through an area of fake rock, which did remind me of queuing for rides in Orlando. There appeared to only be 2 out of five lifts working, which meant that this whole experience downstairs was LONG! The actual lift experience was great and the first 'sight' of the view was also done well. What we didn't like was being herded through to listen to a presentation about hiring iPads and then having to have a photo taken. All we wanted to do was be able to walk around and take photos at our own pace! Finally we got to the 100th floor and were able to get our long-awaited snaps. I understand what people are saying about the glare on the windows and also the fact that people are sitting on the grills in front of the window but we didn't find that too bad. Coming down was fairly straight forward as we didn't need to queue for lifts at all (once we had found out WHERE they were!)All in all we all said that we were glad we had been but all preferred Top of the Rock!"

One World is no different.One World lacks the class and vintage style of yesteryear that ESB has. Nor does it have the friendly ambiance and good cheer and manners that ESB employees have. This tower feels new, lacking that fantasy lore historical magic. It also doesnt offer outside views like TOTR or ESB, or the stellar Central Park views either. So what makes it worrth your hard earned cash?State of the art introductions wisk you thru the entrance to your journey. A fast and furious ride to the top with a movie inside the elevator chronicaling the rise of lower Manhattan. Once up top the views take your breath away.My biggest surprise was the extreme rudeness across the board of the employees. I am hoping it is because it is still somewhat new. Never in all of NYC at any venue has my family been treated so dismissively. I didnt take personal offense as the employees were downright mean and rude to almost all they encountered. Save for the elevator operators, the rest need some serious training in how to treat other human beings, lol.The best part of the One World is respect of the fallen, of my memory of \"THE\" day.

This attraction is very modern and state-of-the-art. They try to amaze their guest from already first seconds after you entered. And watching the city from above is like watching it from the window of a plane when it is descending to land in NYC. Amazing experience and totally worth the money for it! P.S. We visited in the beginning of August and came inside at 7.30 PM to catch the city before sunset, the sunset itself and the night illumination."

So, that got us past a few of the lines, however, once you pass security, there is no one to guide you to the priority line for the elevator to the Observatory. In fact, generally there is a huge shortage of staff around to answer questions and guide you - BIG MISTAKE.We got to the Observatory and made our way to One Dine, where we had a reservation. Got a nice table. But a few things need to be improved with One Dine. The menu is too limited, if you are allergic to a few ingredients, you have no choice. A few more choices would not hurt. Our waiter did accommodate our wishes by offering alternatives, so it all turned out OK. As for the noise, the ridiculous circle thing right below the restaurant is unnecessarily loud and obnoxious, although if you are seated at the back in the booths, it's less obtrusive. The food was OK, the steak pretty good, but I can't help thinking that brasserie style food would be better, rather than the pretence at fine dining?Having spent the best part of $600 on dinner and a further $54 each on priority service, we were expecting some sort of priority treatment to get us back down again. But NO! We had to wait with everyone else, unlike the Empire State Building where the priority ticket gets you up and down in double quick time. I know it's not all about money, but if you do spend more than the average punter, you expect a little more! We joined the enormous line and were struck by the fact that in a throng of at least 500-700 people there was only one member of staff. Now, given what this building is and what happened to its predecessors, it would have been useful and reassuring to have several more members of staff on a busy Saturday evening. I would be interested to know how often evacuation drills are practiced?!? It didn't help that two of the elevators were closed for a private function - in which case, they should have limited the number of paying guests that wanted to come up to the Observatory. A whole lot of people will be left with a memory of a slow-moving line to descend, rather than the great views. In addition, there was a poor lady in a wheelchair having to wait in the line too - again, the Empire State Building gives disabled people priority for the price of a normal ticket.Now, the views are great, but they are obstructed by the construction of the building, or the reflections of all that is going on inside, so it's difficult to get a nice clear view/shot. Why didn't they use non-reflective glass and why no outside observation deck? Overall, it was pretty underwhelming and I believe the Empire State Building offers a much pleasanter experience...I was really looking forward to the whole evening, having visited the Memorial Garden dozens of times and spent hours in the fantastic 9/11 Museum. On the positive side, many of these things can be improved and it is early days, so let's see."

You can rent an iPad that you could learn about all these huge buildings in manhattan (cost 15$).It is more beautiful the view than empire's state building because the \"One world\" is in the south side and you can see better the central manhattan (midtown), and the Booklyn bridge. Also is very good the view to the elis island and the statue if liberty.Best expirience is the elevator that you can enjoy a marvellous video on the walls about the history of this area of new York from the 1600 (I remember) till now. And all this in only 1 min.....that is the time to go from the 0 to 102 floor....My advice is visit absolutely the \"One World\".Enjoy"

But for someone like me, I have visited the Empire State building, Top of the Rock and today One World Observatory, I have to say, Top of the Rock is the best of the best! You can feel the mid town Manhattan vibe and the crowded skyscrapers nowhere else can provide. One World has long line and some unnecessary wait and presentation when you wait. The whole observatory is inside which means your picture reflects a lot of inside image. It's almost impossible to get a wonderful portrait picture like the one you can take at Top of the Rock which gives full outside natural light. If you are first time visitor, no matter where you go, the view will be wonderful. But if you want to pick and choose and get the best experience, try Top of the Rock. The only thumbs up for One World is its easy Restroom facility and elevator ride. I am not affiliated to any places. Just someone who has been living and working in Manhattan for a decade and been to all these touristy places."

Perfectly organised, made with passion and pride. A big positive surprise for me, including a very nice, smiley and skilled staff. Thanks to great organising, almost no lines to wait...Out of all the well-known tops of the roofs in NYC (Empire State, Rockefeller etc) I would do this one definitely FIRST. Go best 1 hour before sunset if you can afford to stay 2 hours...so you would see the city during the day and also during the night. Take there one iPad with great audio-video app per small group of family of friends (for 15 USD), it's definitely worth it. I just would add (in the app) even more sightseeings described in some parts of the city (the only super minor comment to make it even better). Many thanks for this experience."

Because One World is so far south, you do get a great view of the Brooklyn Bridge, but you miss out on Central Park, and all the amazing midtown buildings (the empire state and Chrysler were quite far). Because the entire thing is encased in glass, photos can be quite difficult, due to reflection. The fake bedrock that you walk through at the bottom was really tacky, and I took issue with the giant gift shop that takes up most of the observation floor. I understand it is a tourist stop, but the complete lack of reference or acknowledgement of the twin towers didn't feel right in my gut, and I don't think it would have hurt putting the gift shop on the way out.

The last time we were here as a family in 2009, she was poorly and my son and I walked from Grand Central Terminal to Ground Zero to experience the scale of lower Manhattan, particularly in the light of its 2001 history. Back then the site was in the process of what looked on paper to be a poignant and powerful transformation. Today we experienced the product of that transformation in all it's stunning majesty. For this is not simply a trip to the top of a building. This is an unbelievable experience that will, quite literally take your breath away. I won't spoil it for you - (others may!) - but from the moment you are thro the strictest security I've ever experienced (they found a Metro pass in one of my hidden pockets) you are part of this building. In a quite indescribable way, the designers and architects have constructed something utterly unique. The lift journeys up and down are SO much more than lift journeys. The stunning audio visual in the little theatre at the top before you access the observation deck is stunning and its denouement has my neck hairs dancing and my throat choking with emotion. And then there is the deck itself. State of the art interactive options; glassfloors, and the most iconic views of NYC imaginable. Many, including myself, assumed that with the lossof the Twin Towers, these views would be lost forever. That they have been restored and indeed enhanced is a phenomenal testimony to the vision, tenacity, perseverance and sheer defiance that says to the world \"The good guys will never give in.\" We are all part of the history of this building. Visit it if you do nothing else when in NYC - and spend some reflectivemoments around the 9/11 memorial where the inspiration for this magnificent masterpiece was born...."

I feared going to the new WTC, afraid the anger and sorrow would overtake me but it was remarkable, the love that went into building it is what remains. I do not say this lightly as I am not the existential sort. Where I expected to find sorrow I found overwhelming love. How amazing. I wish I could thank them all for creating it. I honestly had no idea that that much love could erase so much evil and hate. The experience is different than the old WTC, you do run the gauntlet of waiting in the different lines. But the view is amazing, the elevator video is amazing as well along with the interview videos of those who built the new building. Buy the tickets on line as others have mentioned, it will save you grief. You do go through a security checkpoint just like the airport so dress accordingly. It was worth the cost of buying the flexible ticket. Park near the site as access is confusing."

The queue looked quite big as we arrived and the staff were telling visitors the next available tickets on open sale were for 2pm. So book early and save your tickets to your phone! The queue did move pretty quickly. The lifts take about a minute to the observation deck and have a 360 degree screen with showed the development of the NY skyline. Once at the observation deck you are made to sit through a short film showing different NY scenes-there is a nice surprise at the end of the clip but the presentation just delays what you came to see-the view! The view is excellent-no other observation deck can capture the NY skyline looking back over Manhattan. The deck also provides good views of the key bridges and also Liberty. The glass used in the building was slightly reflective but not as bad as in some places. Even though the deck was busy it didn't feel cramped and you could easily reach a window. My only complaint was the signage was poor from the subway station."

That said, this experience stresses the importance of rebuilding and even taps a number of the workers who speak to the camaraderie and spirit that infused the project. The result is nothing less than amazing!The attraction starts off with a high-tech and speedy elevator ride and ends up with an off-the-charts view. For $15 you can enhance the experience with an iPad that helps you identify many sites (with a few videos peppered in). While not necessary, it adds to the gee-whiz factor.I recently went to the Empire State Building which is certainly the iconic attraction, but it really doesn't compare to One World Observatory. Top of the Rock is also nice, but doesn't have all the bells and whistles. For the money...and the experience...I would go here."

All the observation staff were helpful and courteous. Once you get off the elevator the initial film and your first exposure to the view are terrific. All in all a very special experience. However our dining experience was much less special. First I want to say the meal and service were very good and although we thought the charge for the elevator was over the top, the cost of the meal ($84 pp) was worth it. Now to the problems, if you are going to call it a fine dining restaurant, it isn't just about the food. The restaurant is an open space directly overlooking the observation floor and there is nothing separating the spaces, so what you hear throughout dinner is loud talking among the people down below, guides yelling above the talking, and loud music. You cannot hear the person sitting next to you. Even the food and view cannot compensate for the crazy noise and the inability to hold a conversation. Last but not least after dinner, ready to head home and guess what, you have to wait on a very long line for an elevator to leave. There is no difference for the ONE dining customers and the people there only for the observation tower. One would think maybe a restaurant elevator. Once in the elevator, another exciting trip.The company running the restaurants is actually more like a food vendor, I think they are more comfortable with a ball park environment....and the ambiance was kind of like that. We are from the tri-state area, raised in NYC and have spent a lot of time at fine dining restaurants, this is definitely not Windows on the World or Cellar in the Sky (where we had many great times), and definitely not a fine dining experience. Better to have only the hot dogs etc. and forget the \"fine dining\" unless you can do it right, especially in a place considered so special by so many."

We wanted to visit because of the view and the history of the building. The visit had a bit of a theme park feel which visitors may or may not like. The staff were professional in their guidance and informative presentations. I suggest hiring the 'Explorer' tablet device they offer when you leave the introductory presentation and enter the viewing area. The Explorer gives names and gives information about the sites you are viewing."

It was completely packed (although it was close to the 4th July weekend) and you couldn't help but feel herded the entire time.

I clearly remember the events of 9/11, so it brought back unpleasant memories, but it's hard not to appreciate the \"phoenix rising from the ashes\" effect that this building provides, along with the other development of the trade center complex.Lines and waiting at each juncture, even with advance ticket purchase. But they moved quickly enough, with great positive employee engagement along the way. Of course an amazing view.Be prepared for several opportunities to spend money - (1) having your photo taken with photo backdrop of the city, (2) renting an ipad for tour information, (3) souvenir shop on the observation deck.But amazing views, all around, of course.four not five bullets, as there's not much available to help explain what you're seeing, unless you rent the ipad. No brouchure, no labels on the window sills, no \"mapping\" of buildings to explain what you're seeing."

I want to write a review on the restaurant One however couldn't find it under restaurants.The attraction and view are amazing, of course as you are 103 floors in the air.What was terribly disappointing was the restaurant One. We booked this before leaving Australia and expected a lot more for the prices we paid. There is no fast tracking for reservation holders. Although we did organise the fast track with the concierge. You should be taken up and not through the cheaper bar type eateries.Once you finally get into the restaurant there is no atmosphere as all you can hear is the tour groups going through and the tour guide on the loud speaker. This is due to the fact that One is on a mezzanine so the sound travels.Also the service was shocking. Not fine dining as you expect from the prices.lastly there should be a fast track or someone taking you back down from the restaurant but instead you have to que up with everyone else.The good itself was ok but the entire experience underwhelming... book at one of the many other amazing restaurants & just go for the view."

Buying tickets was easy enough on line. They offer a couple different options. Cheapest tickets are around $30 and must be used at a specific time. They will not let you enter the line until 15 minutes prior to your admission time. Flex tickets that can be used at any time are available but cost more. And VIP tickets are also available and let you skip the lines. It took roughly 25 minutes to get through the lines and make it to the top. The elevator ride took only 51 seconds and was incredibly crafted to add to the experience. Once off the elevator, they created another experience. I won't go into a lot of details as to not spoil the experience. Once at the top, you are not rushed and the crowds are not overwhelming. After seeing this attraction, I would certainly consider it a must do in NYC. No where else can you get a view of the concrete jungle that is NYC like this. Not to mention, being on the 102nd floor of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. Visiting NY requires a trip to the WTC site. And since you are down there, you might as well add this attraction to your itinerary."

But, I think I can generally recommend viewing this new attraction, whatever your feelings. Reservations are recommended; but if you find yourself here without reservations, you may still be able to get in, though there may be a wait. The elevators seem to defy the laws of physics, both up and down. On a clear day, the 360 degree view (from the enclosed observation deck) is spectacular. There is no external deck. The restaurant was not cheap (of course), but the food was appropriately good and you have that jaw-dropping view while you're eating. You can take as long as you want to look around; there aren't any other attractions up there. IMHO the towers should have been rebuilt twice or three times as tall; but looking past that disappointment, this is now one of the new, must-see attractions in nyc, at least until another, taller building opens in the Hudson Yards area with a higher observation deck. The admission fee is similar to other tall buildings in nyc which permit sightseeing."

As advised on our ticket, we arrived 15 minutes before our alloted time and we pleasantly surprised by the lack of a big queue! Once through security\u00a0 (which was no more than 10 minutes) we were quickly on our way up to the observation deck. The views were breathtaking and you could see the south of Manhattan, including the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The staff informed us that it was fantastic visibility on the day that we visited and that it isn't always as easy to see. Whilst I would recommend this experience for those visiting New York, we were left very disappointed by the lack of information about the building of the tower. I found myself looking on Google to find answers to our questions! There was also no reference to the Twin Towers although this may be something which is discussed more at the Memorial Museum. Worth a visit but do your own research and be prepared to queue to get down!"

Then a short spiel to encourage you to rent an IPad that will show you what you will be looking at. This may come in handy if you are not familiar with New York as there are no display signs anywhere. Finally, you do down one floor to the observation deck where you can enjoy the spectacular view at your leisure. Food and drinks are available and also an assortment of overpriced souvenirs at the gift shop. One example, logo golf balls, which I do collect but had to pass on these, were 3 for $30.00. I get this is NYC and the tallest building in the USA, but that was just a little too high for me. Overall, great views, but we spent less then a hour there."

Whilst One World Observatory affords a unique view looking North toward the whole of Manhattan, the Mid Town vistas probably give you a better all around view of NYC.The area around the old WTC site has obviously been through a major transformation over the years and One WTC is certainly an amazing addition in terms of scale and grandeur, from the PATH station through to the tower itself.We visited the observation deck on a Thursday morning in June and there were relatively small queues. We wanted to be time efficient so bough fast track tickets, which would come in really handy when it came to exit.The views and vistas are amazing but since it's all enclosed behind glass you do get less of a sense of the height than you might do at Top of the Rock.It's a pretty big observation deck though, so even if it's busy there are plenty of vantage points.There are no public seating areas to speak of other than in a small canteen type area that gets very crowded. There is also revered seating in a bar/restaurant but you'd need to be eating from an overpriced menu to snag a table.Now back to the fast track tickets. The exit line snaked around the whole of the observation deck so getting out would have taken much longer then to get in had it not been for the fast track entry tickets which also gave us fast track exit.......If I were to return to NYC I think I'd be 50/50 about going back to the observatory. I'm not sure it's worth the hassle. Much better to spend time at ground level and at the museum underneath the Reflecting Pools."

Luckily though you're not forced to pose for a cheesy photo, which seems to be the case everywhere else!That all being said though, the views from up there are pretty stunning. Perhaps the highlight for me was actually the lift/elevator ride - you have a 180 degree time-lapse simulation of the building of Manhattan which moves in time with the ascending lift. There was included a nice, poignant reminder of the twin towers as they appear to the side for only a brief second. Very clever, very well done.If you've never been to New York before then it's probably worth a visit, but I would personally go to the Rockefeller every time."

            "review": "Waste of time.. At the beginning of June on a hot and sunny Sunday afternoon, we treated a visitor to NY to a visit to One World. The tickets were purchased in advance for $34 and $32 for the 2 seniors accompanying us. BTW, for an extra $20, you can purchase VIP tickets that allows to skip the lines. We were advised to arrive at least 30 minutes ahead of time, we got there 45 minutes early with our 3pm tickets. We joined the line and waited and waited until eventually it was our turn, to enter the blessed air conditioned building at 3:20. Inside there was a line for the escalator down to the elevators, a line through security and a walk through a \"multi media\" display of the workers who built the new WTC. Now another line to get on the elevator to the observation deck. The elevator ride was interesting, it showed you layers of the bedrock, old New York and pictures of the NYC skyline. On the observation deck, a big whoops. To me a New Yorker for more years than I care to remember, it was no big deal, While it was a sunny day, looking out from the observation deck, there was a definite haze limiting your view, Many years ago I had the pleasure of visiting the 107 floor of the WTC on a cooler and much clearer day. The NYC skyline has not changed that much in the years in between. We spent about a half hour on the observation deck.My opinion, it's not worth $34, if you are a resident and have visitors, buy them tickets, drop 'em off and pick 'em back up.Problems especially in the summer, no shade in waits of an hour or more for most people. Long waits all around and very crowded. The only area that was not crowded was the restroom on the observation deck. There was also a 15 minute wait to descend back to the lobby. My visit occurred about 2-3 weeks after the opening of One World."

No, you can't see outside while in the elevator. A nice place to visit. Price was $32 for adults."

When we reached the top, it was so crowded that we couldn't really get close to the windows. People were camped out sitting on the ledges. The windows had a coating on them so photography was difficult. The views are much better at The Top of the Rock. I would recommend the museum guided tour but skip this."

The associates working were curious, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about all things related to One World Observatory. I don't want to ruin any body's experience but the elevator and theater experience is something to behold and ponder over afterwards. The space available is expansive however can become, at time, over crowded. Be patient and if you can, go before 11am, as the rush flows in! The area serving food and beverage is okay however a bit pricey? The shop full of souvenirs has a reasonable collection of the usual suspects however, if you're a collector of patches then this venue doesn't have anything. I purchased a pin online for $12 and received this after showing my original booking via phone or printed on paper. The window does have a slight reflection for taking photographs, but the angle of taking a photograph negates this. The windows were at 10am full of finger print marks, particularly from kids and adults alike - merely from the fact that they were in awe of the spectacular view. I would recommend you get there before midday or before dusk sets in to reward you with perfect viewing opportunities. "

Getting There - Take a train from New Jersey or New York and walk straight into the Observatory entrance from the Path Station.Tickets - Buy tickets online. It's easy and saves time. Carry a print out but tickets on the Smartphone work as well. There's a line for security as well after the tickets are checked and validatedElevator - The elevator ride to the top is magnificent. It takes about 45 seconds to reach the top floor. The elevators are on of the fastest in the world and are setup with digital screens to give you some cool facts about the elevator ride. Here's the actual video: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/20/one-world-trade-center-elevators-500-Once Upstairs - you have a small presentation about the city of New York which leads into the blinds opening and you getting a terrific view of the city. You proceed to enter the observatory after this. iPads for Information - you can rent iPads with pre-loaded softwares for $15 which provide a better understanding to the views from the top. I highly recommend these if you are new to the city and if this is your first time in the city. They are informative, easy to use and definitely provide a better understanding behind the history of the area. Tip: The guys working for the observatory are super nice. They gave us 2 iPads for $15.Restaurant - There is a restaurant with seating as well as a quick pick and go area. Enjoy a nice meal on the top. The Flatbread Pizza's were delicious.Overall - a great way to start a tour of the city. Even if you live in the city, this is definitely a highly recommended site."

The week of our visit they had approximately 62,000 visitors at about $30+ per person- do the math. Next you will get in line to get into the elevator. The 60 second ride up is fast and fun. Pay attention to the elevator screen because the scene changes and you see the city evolve over time. Once you get off the elevator you go into a room with a screen/covered window that has an audio presentation then the window cover goes up and the city is revealed. Next you encounter yet another line to have your picture taken. They don't offer a way around the picture if you don't want it taken, you have to wait until you can walk through what would be your turn to take the picture. After you get done in that room you get shuffled into another room for a \"presentation\". The presentation turned out to be a sales pitch for iPads you can rent for $15.00. The iPads will identify surrounding buildings and allow you to take pictures. The view is amazing but didn't like to be nickeled and dimed. Why charge visitors more money to identify buildings? Why not just have iPad stations set up for visitors to use at will? They are clearly making a lot of money and it seemed unnecessary to be so greedy. They have a gift shop (t-shirts around $36.00) and they also sell food. FYI- this place is NOT affiliated with the 9/11 memorial and museum. If you're set on visiting the Freedom tower I highly suggest you purchase your tickets online and select the time you want to visit. If you purchase tickets there you will stand in line outside (direct sun- no shade) for about 15-20 minutes just to get inside to purchase the tickets and be given a time to return. Save your self the hassle and purchase online or use your smart phone. If you want to purchase priority tickets (no waiting) plan on spending $54.00 per person. Overall the view is beautiful but the steps to get to that view left me disappointed. My alternate suggestion to getting a good view of the city is to go to Rockefeller Centers Top of the Rock where you get a beautiful view of the city and Central Park, plus you get to step outside for beautiful pictures."

The staff seemed like they had no idea what was going on or how to take care of the customers. We again decided to pass and headed down to the viewing area.

We were lucky though, 3 hours later the cloud had descended so I can't imagine you could see anything from the top.Downsides.....the cafe and the souvenir shop were overpriced (for example: a postcard of the Observatory cost $4.95+tax). We were ignored by the counter staff in the cafe who were more interested in chatting amongst themselves than serving us and the muffin/tea we eventually purchased were expensive. There was also nowhere to sit to enjoy said snack, you could stand at a table but not sit, they obviously don't want you to linger over your refreshments to enjoy the view further.So I would recommend the One World Observatory, the views are spectacular and different to those from the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock (we have done both) but save your money and spend it once back in the city rather than at the Observatory."

We had a timed entry which meant we walked straight in at our appointed time; there's the usual airport style security before you enter. As other reviewers have noted it is a bit like a theme park ride, following a clear path with clips about how the building was constructed, which makes it dramatic and extends the time you spend there but I must admit I would have preferred to get straight into the lift. That said it's all done extremely well. When you board the lift there's a fantastic history of New York explained in the short time it takes to get to the top, then you have to wait before the view is revealed. As you exit you are corralled to get your photo taken and offered an iPad reference guide ($15 I believe). If that's not for you, there's no pressure to partake. We had a beautiful sunny day and the views were incredible, they are on 2 levels and guides are on hand to advise on different aspects of New York eg culture. There are a couple of eateries, but unless you go for the table service restaurant, you have to stand to eat. We got around this by having a drink at the bar with a delicious cheese plate - and of course the magnificent views. There is a large gift shop area with souvenirs for all budgets. When you descend, there is a different experience in the lift. It's good value and there's no pressure to rush."

Curiously I was then told the first ticket available was for 9.30am which I gladly accepted meaning I could go straight down to the entrance and security checks. With only a handful of people in front of me I was soon through the airport style checks and was able to enjoy the video wall displays. Having watched these it was into a lift (with more video walls) to floor 102. The See Forever display was all part of the experience with a climatic end ( no spoilers!). Having bypassed the slightly irritating attempts to offer iPad tours and a cheesy photo I was into the two floors at the top. Great views of the surrounding area which shouldn't be missed. Sadly all behind glass which does make photography difficult but not impossible. On the Sunday morning it was relatively quiet. The Tuesday evening visit around sunset was much busier. Having said that after booking for 8pm on my iPhone I then arrived at 7.30pm to find I could go straight in. At the top, with the sun setting after 8pm most people sat by the windows so opportunity to get a good view / photo opportunity were initially limited. The windows also showed the handprints of all that day's visitors which I hadn't noticed at my previous visit. Although not used there is also a cafe at floor 102 together with restrooms. A very enjoyable experience well worth a trip to the top at the right time for the standard admission price of $32."

Cost is already high just to get in and after you get to the top and the big reveal, they try to cram you into a tiny space and rent you an iPad to \"enhance\" your visit. Fine if you want it but they make you sit through their spiel in a room not designed to hold the people they are cramming in. Then... they try to take your picture and sell you that too. Really!!! you just did this big reveal and then they slow you down and accost you as aggressive as any panhandler you've ever encountered. Also, in this brand new building they have set up temporary lines outside in the hot hot sun to line up and get tickets. The summer was awful, imagine the rain and the winter. They have got to figure out a better queue system. I can't tell you how much these things took away from what would otherwise be a Terrific visit."

The tour experience is very organized and well controlled with lots of security and guides who were very friendly and helpful. Beginning at the base of the building you will find yourself moved by the video presentation which are extremely well produced and evocative. The elevator ride to the top is amazing. You will never forget it and I could do it over and over again. NYC unfolds all around you from it's early beginning to present day. I felt like a molecule in the center of all that growth and change. When you get to the top you are asked to line up and view another extremely well produced video and then, presto, you are looking out the windows at a magnificent view, really breathtaking. The next room you are ushered into is where it gets dicey. The minute you enter the room where many employees are waiting you get that feeling one often gets on the streets in NYC and other cities...you are about to be hustled. They want you to rent the IPADs.....at 15.00 each, which are pretty cool, but the hustle, the pitch, is somehow demeaning of what that place stands for. As you moved into the next area there are a couple of places to get food and drink, but they are not special or really deserving of the history of that spot. So, finally, you enter the observation room which is in a ring around the entire top of the building. The view is, as you might imagine, astounding. All in all, well worth the price of admission with a caveat. Please take away the hustle factor, this place is like a shrine, a testament to a terrible event and all the brave and terrified people that died there. It is a monument to the spirit of Americans, don't cheapen that."

I brought visitors from out of town to the 9-11 Memorial and to the Observation Deck of Freedom Tower. It felt like a Disneyland ride and I felt like I was in the waiting area for Space Mountain or Pirates of the Caribbean on the way to the elevators. The elevator ride up is interesting since you are surrounded by walls of video screens that portray the skyline from the beginning to current time.You get off and you have no choice but to watch a movie. It again felt like Disneyland to the point where the guy inside said \"please go to the left and fill all available space\". They showed a cheesy New York moment video that was all flash. Then the video screens lift and you get to see real skyline for 25 seconds or so and the screens start down again and they tell you to exit to the right. They should leave it up at least until you get out of there. Then you are directed to an area where they are taking canned photos...for $19,99 against a horrible backdrop that isn't even interesting to prove you were there? They tell you to all stop. Don't stop unless you want that photo. I mean this AGAIN feels like Disney. But wait...not done yet. You get to another area and this woman is again telling everyone to STOP. Why you might ask? They are going to give you a spiel on the Ipad tour for $19,99. I asked the woman do we really NEED to stop or are you just giving us a sales pitch? Sales pitch.You don't need to stop if you don't want to get those things.They need a bypass so you don't need to watch the movie and they really need to stop making everyone stop for the 2 \"buy this\" spiels.Once you get through all of that it's a fantastic view. Make sure to walk all the way around to see Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island (with a great view of the Statue of Liberty, New Jersey. Take your time and enjoy. You have earned it. I wish there was way to get there without feeling like you are going through Disneyland and a sales gauntlet.The elevator ride down is also fun. They show a moving 360 view of what it looks like outside the Freedom Tower."

Almost in a minute the state of the art elevator takes the visitor to the 102nd floor. The view & experience inside the elevator is also something to remember. At 102nd floor there is a two-minute panoramic video presentation on New York City life - which is wonderful in content and technique. The observatory offers 360 degree view of the city covering Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty as well as New Jersy on the other bank of Hudson.

When you exit the elevator, there is a short movie with a remarkable reveal of the view. The observatory is completely enclosed, and you view through glass. 102 floors up, and I felt a lot more comfortable being indoors! Yes the lines can be long. We went one a Sunday afternoon with a group of 5. The ticket line was long, so I used my iPhone to purchase tickets immediately. We walked right inside and down to the waiting lobby for our 2:45pm time. As soon as it was 2:45, they began taking us through security. There were no lines from there!Do NOT plan on buying food at the top! They wanted $7 for a gatorade."

Buy your ticket online ahead of time and be sure to get the PRIORITY tickets. We got to bypass about an hour and a half worth of outside and inside lines because of it. People that were trying to buy tickets on location were told to buy them on their phones.My biggest sway from the experience is their giftshop. They have wonderful items, awesome staff, a great creative variety of items, availability of items, BUT THEIR $3.9 BILLION MORTGAGE IS INFLUENCING IT. A basic T-Shirt is $35. Magnets $5. Photo print posters $60+. Be sure to be prepared to not find seating anywhere unless you are in the fine dining restaurant. Everywhere is standing room only which leaves many resolving to sitting on the window ledges which blocks others from getting close enough to see down and take pictures. Their food area has two options. There is a casual \"walk up to counter\" service and a \"table/server\" area. The walk up area offers a limited amount of pre-made / warm up in oven sandwiches. Cost is about $15 a person / meal. The walk up food is ok. It is similar to the lunch shops found around the city panini,sandwiches, flatbreads, wraps. When it comes to where you eat, they have high tables without chairs for you to stand and eat from. The dining room will cost about $40-50 a person and it offers much more fine dining. There isn't a wait to get in so you should be fine to just walk up and get a table. Be sure to go there and enjoy it. As always with any experience, my conditions of encounter might not be the same as yours. Things can change as time goes on, survey responses come in, and crowds increase/decrease. Hope this helps!!"

That being said, the visit was smooth thanks to how visitors are herded (for lack of better word) through it all in a very organized and mostly friendly fashion. The fact that I had booked my ticket online on beforehand probably helped reduce waiting time. The much talked-about elevator rides were neat but not exceptional. The views from the 102nd floor are not as great as the views you get from the Empire State Building or from Top of the Rock.In short, if you're only going to do one visit like this, to get great views of Manhattan and its beautiful skyline, then I would recommend either of those two instead of One World Observatory. However, if you're a frequent and recurring visitor such as myself, who've done Empire State and Rock several times, then by all means try something new and go here at least once."

The elevator ride goes fast, as a video is shown on all of the elevator walls depicting the history of what NYC would have looked like through time. Once at the top, we ate lunch at the restaurant up top (no reservations - jus show up). The food was only slightly overpriced, but not bad. It was mostly high end burgers and sandwiches. They had a good (not great) beer menu. A number of folks seemed to like the idea of enjoying a good beer while taking in the views. You can view out all the way around (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Statue of Liberty, New Jersey, etc.).

We had 4pm tickets, the place was crowded, there is nowhere for anyone to sit so people sat in the window wells (with their backs to the view) so you could not approach any of the areas to really soak in what was in front of you. You are stopped as a group on a few occasions - once for photos against a screen of NYC (you can just bypass this but it involves walking through it) then stopped again for a \"presentation\" which is really just trying to get you to spend more money on renting iPads that give you an overview of the view. Installing plaques with descriptions could work just as well and at $32 a ticket to keep asking people to \"add on\" is ridiculous. If I was going for a true NYC view experience I would say go to The Top of the Rock where you can at least see the scope of Central Park. The elevators going up and down with the videos that play was the best part of the experience. Sorry but I was disappointed in the whole event."

The line inside winds around (like a Disney line) but there are murals telling the stories of the people who were a part of its building and this makes the time pass quickly. I don't think I would pay extra for the express/fast ticket because you would miss these stories. Once up top, it is kind of like any other high tower -- you can see for miles if the weather and visibility is right."

You are then herded to where you wait for your turn to have a 'no obligation' photo taken against a green screen picture of Manhattan. You can't skip either of these 'no obligation' moments.Because the viewing is all indoors it is very difficult to take a good photo that balances the inside/ outside light properly through the glass.Do the 9/11 museum below but skip the observatory at all costs."

The stunning view and the lead up to it was great. I thought the whole thing was well organised and not Too many people that you didn't get a turn looking at the view. There is a really good introduction to to the view.Low points - we waited for about 20 minutes before we went in. About 5 minutes waiting for the elevator. About 20 minutes standing waiting for the theatre show and watching the theatre show. Then standing in line for the obligatory photo etc. My husband has limited mobility and finds standing a problem so we really needed somewhere for him to sit and they didn't cater for that. Prices at the shop and restaurant seemed far too high. I prefer top of the rock as you are outside for photos whereas the fingerprints on the glass, reflections, people using flash made photography limited.A must place to visit."

We walked past the line of people waiting to buy tickets, then took the escalator down, turned right at the bottom, and walked right up to the screening area - they have a separate screening area for Priority ticket holders, no wait, and we walked right past the huge lines and into a waiting elevator. The elevator itself is a marvel, as you ascend it shows you the skyline from hundreds of years ago (under water) to present time. Then you exit into a small hallway, and they open the screen for your first view of the skyline. Eye popping! The views were phenomenal - as were the crowds. It was sometimes difficult to get a place at the windows. Also, after you see your first glimpse of the skyline, they funnel you down stairs and hawk interactive ipads for $15. We barely used ours. Worth the expense, you can't get a better view in the country."

More so than the panoramic views of Manhattan (which were breathtaking, BTW), we were touched by the testimonies of the workers and other people involved in the building of this amazing building. It was very special to us, as was the memorial pools. The elevator ride to the top was phenomenal as well. Cost was $32.00 apiece. We did not mind paying it, as it was well worth it! Next time we go up to NYC we will do the museum - - we just ran out of time this time, and plus with the crowds and heat we thought Fall may be a better time to do it.

I made some of the vendors laugh when I asked if they sold Windex: I would have loved to clean the windows myself - grubby fingerprints and smudges everywhere. I imagine that early in the day they are cleaner (we got there at 5:15PM). Is it better than the ESB or Top of the Rock? Hard to compare - they all have their plusses. From the latter you see all of Central Park, and the ESB. The elevator is a wonder at 50 seconds, and the coup de theatre after the initial presentation merits the applause it receives big time."

I have visited almost 4/5 towers across globe and each one has their uniqueness. Best part of this attraction was the elevator and the show just before the observatory deck. This fastest elevator takes you to the top with video view of the city. The show just before the observatory deck is an innovative idea where you get the glimpse of the city that never sleeps and then the complete 360 aerial view of the city.

I remember going to the top of the Twin Towers several times as a kid, but the view from inside the Freedom Tower was amazing. I was slightly worried, because the Towers, had an outside observation deck, while this was inside but it did not detract from the experience at all. It is sometimes difficult to get that \"perfect shot\" cause a window beam would be in the way but no big deal. The elevator up took 60 seconds and was the coolest elevator I have been on, but I wont ruin the surprise. Even though I am familiar with many of the NYC landmarks, I still shelled out the $15 for the device that tells you what everything is and gives you a birds eye view of them. The devices image rotates with your point of view and is pretty cool even though I had to re calibrate it probably around 8x (not a big deal). The view from the top is amazing, and on a somewhat hazy day, you could still see the GW bridge about 10 miles away. You get amazing views of the downtown area including the Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Jeresy City, and of course the entire skyline. If you are coming to NYC, I would say this is a must do activity. My nephew who was my tour guide is from Brooklyn, and he enjoyed it just as much as me. My only minor complaints are that it seemed a bit to crowded, the optional presentations are a tad to cheesy, and I guess its to be expected but the prices at the gift shop were beyond preposterous. Anyway, if you are going to the Big Apple, go for it. Try to get the tickets before hand, and try to plan your trip on a fairly sunny day."

Went with my family and paid over $ 150 for 3 \"PRIORITY\" passes.WE were put in the wrong line and ended up with no real benefit.Got out of elevator and was herded to the far left while another 50 people came in to the small viewing room.After a 2 minute viewing , everyone exited from the right so we were now at the back of the line being the last ones out. Not the end of the world, but when you pay extra for something, you expect to get it!When we were finished on the main floor 100, and finished buying over priced food and gifts, we then got on the end of a long line to catch an elevator down. I asked if there was a \" Priority \" exit line and was told NO !If seems a very good sales pitch to get unsuspecting tourist to pay extra !I will not be recommending to anyone to pay for Priority until they know what the true meaning of the word means."

It is iconic, patriotic and the entire World Trade Center complex is amazing to see. I think everyone that appreciates FREEDOM should go to support that area. Here are our tips:DO:1. We paid the extra $ to fast pass and avoid the line. I have heard of line nightmares there so we did it and are glad we did. If it's in your budget -it will enhance your trip.2. The elevators are incredible. Be ready to take the coolest elevator ride of your life. If you have small children - pick them up so they can see better. The entire elevator turns into a video screen that tells the story of NYCs development - while appearing like you are in glass as you ascend to the 103 floor. Incredible.3. As you get off the elevator - there is guide that will give a presentation and its worth seeing. Look for the circular video screen. It's very informative.DONT DO:1. They try to sell you an iPad based screen you can hold up and as you hold it up to the windows - it labels the buildings do you can see what you're looking at. NOT WORTH IT. Our iPad really didn't work that well and when it did it was lackluster. It ended up being the thing nobody wanted wayto even carry around. If you do get one - get ONE per family. That way you guys can pass it around when you're sick of it. LolIn the end I highly recommend it. Great presentation, and there are a few surprises I'm not giving away. Definitely more than just a view and that's a good thing. After all, a view is just a view."

This observatory tour is very well conceptualized, the highlights being the innovative elevators and goosebumps-inducing show at the top.Three suggestions - 1. Toilet tissue needs to be higher quality 2. For families travelling with senior citizens, wheelchair availability would be strongly recommended. 3. Places to sit in the observatory, without having to pay at the restaurant would be nice. Families need some hang out space to feed infants and sit."

You can reserve a tour time online (which means you need to know exactly when you will be in the area to make your time) or you can line up when you get there. The line moves quickly and then, based on your time, you can go look at the memorial pools, grab something to eat, walk to the department store to use the bathroom, etc. The elevator ride itself is amazing even though it only takes 45 seconds! When you get off, there's a short documentary about the building which really builds the audience's anticipation for the observatory view! This was the highlight of the experience for me. The observatory itself is cool if you like looking at streets, bridges, and the tops of buildings. Based on what time you go will depend on whether or not the sun causes glare on the windows which doesn't make for great photos. There is also a restaurant and gift shop for those who want a souvenir. Having stood on top of the original World Trade Centre in May of 2001 and watched in horror 9/11 on tv in real time, they have done an exceptional job of preserving a memorial for all those that perished in the 2 buildings in the plaza (and including the names of those from the other 2 locations) and by creating an amazing \"show\" of rising again in the observatory tour. I was impressed."

The observatory on the 102nd floor offers a view that is awesome! The whole experience, from the ground floor to the elevator ride to the top is amazing, and the is stunning. There is a coffee shop, and restaurants for light and fine dining on 101, plus book store and gift shop, and City Pulse - an educational station, and Sky Portal, which offers a direct view of the streets below (without looking out the windows).I heard one visitor exclaim, \"It's like Disneyland for adults.\" You will love it.

Surrounded with trees and plant life to give this a sense of peace. The fountains give you time to contemplate what happened there as the names of everyone who lost their lives are engraved into the marble surrounding then fountains.The museum has two aims I think. The official side is shown in a timeline of the terrorist act and how the various departments responded. Then there is the human side and individual stories. This is more difficult to read without being affected. There is a section in the museum which warns you that it shows images that many would find to disturbing. There is a ticket system in place to ensure people have time to visit the museum but be prepared for large numbers of people as you go further into it. There are too many areas to discuss here but it's a place everyone should visit to pay their respects to those lost and their families. It also demonstrates a solidarity against the horrors of terrorism."

It took my breath away, so I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone else by revealing what it is. After that, you are free to walk around the observation level. The only thing I didn't like was that it was an additional $15 for a tablet which would point out the buildings that you're seeing. However, that didn't spoil anything for us. We really enjoyed the views and took many, many pictures. We spent about an hour here and would highly recommend it.

After the long and confusing queueing process, we finally got to the entrance of the observatory where too many people were packed into a small area to view a short video. I could not see the introduction due to the overcrowding. Then, the gates were opened, and like a Macy sale, everyone almost ran into the observatory area but we were still being corralled past selling points for iPads and food. Finally when I get to the viewing area, everyone was sitting or standing on the air conditioning vents around the viewing windows, and not moving. The staff made no attempt to stop people standing on the vents to take selfies. These vents were bending under the weight of some. Taking a picture was an exercise in pushing, cleaning the window and having your groin in someone's face.There is little or no sound deadening technology so the whole experience was crowded, noisy and a long way from reflective, respectful or orderly. This was the worst viewing platform experience I have ever had. Management should look at the people management strategies of the Burj Khalifa for a lesson in how to do it right.Not good value for money and not a good viewing experience."

We live in New York so waited until we had out-of-town guests to see this extravaganza at the World Trade Center. The exhibit is fantastic, the visuals and the technology are amazing, but I come away feeling underwhelmed. The $30+ dollar admission is fair considering the amount of work to create this multimedia experience, but I would much rather have lower admission price to a simple elevator and a simple observation deck. I guess that fancy experiences are common to all the tall buildings now, but for me it is unnecessary. So, the Freedom Tower. The lobby is gorgeous, simple white marble in a style pleasantly reminiscent of the old World Trade Towers. One must pass through security just like at any airport. Then, you walk through thoughtfully-created displays on your way to the elevator lobby, These displays tug at your heartstrings, looking backwards to 2001, but it is not the same as going into the separate museum.The elevator ride is a hoot, with amazing time & distance videos. I love elevators, I love heights, so I didn't need this distraction, but I'm sure that anyone with anxiety about going up a tall building will appreciate the diversion.At the top, you get herded into a fantastic (but for me unnecessary) video montage of the history and sights of NYC, a fabulous display yet I would have rather just looked out the windows at all the sights I love.Then the crowd gets herded into a room where they offer iPad experiences for rent - I'm sure that they are wonderful, but I never buy audio or video guides anywhere. I prefer to experience things real time.Down one escalator through a food and gift court, down second escalator where we finally get to see the splendor of NYC. I loved this floor. Floor to ceiling windows, unobstructed views in every direction. We could wander to our hearts' content. There are some video demonstrations but we ignored them because I just wanted to look and look at all the buildings and streets. So, the actual observation floor is absolutely fabulous, open, spacious, and beautifully designed. I could stay there for hours. All of the extra stuff leading up? I could do without it."

It is next to impossible with the dirty glass, reflections and people sitting along the vent ledge on the entire perimeter of the building. I've never had to work so hard for a decent photo. Plus, they will be a bit grainy since you're so high. I recommend just walking around and take it in. I bought a Flex Pass before my visit so I could go any weekday and supposedly bypass, what they call fast track, general admission. I'm not a fan of the Disney-esque herd you from one area to the next with videos and up selling so I figured it was worth the extra money. I just want to look at the view. So, I did bypass the line for the elevator however you have to queue up for a 3 minute video at the top too. Ugh. I just want to look at the view. They reveal the view after the video but you are herded to another room for the iPad up sell. Again, I just want to look at the view. Then finally you're allowed into the observatory.I will say the staff I spoke to were friendly and the views were amazing but, check the box, I won't be back. The Empire State Building and Top of the Rock were a much more pleasant experience in the open air with unobstructed photo opportunities."

It s the perfect combination with the observatory from Top of the Rock because from the second you can see the Central Park but from One World Observatory you can see the Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn, plus the bridges and all the skyscrapers great views. I booked tickets online the day before and it worked just fine. For me, the best time to go is in the late afternoon (we were there at 6 pm and there was no line or large crowd inside) so you can see the city before and after sunset and the night lights as well: you can get two great photographs of each side of the city. We stayed until about 8.45 pm waiting for sunset in the bar with a glass of wine! What else could you need for a pleasant evening and such nice views? The worst: Don' t go for the Ipad choice, it s a waste of money. Appart from that, we didn't like the attitude of the staff who lied by shouting to the bunch of people who were coming in to grab an Ipad without explaining FIRST that you have to pay for it. Seriously, that is dishonest customer service.The best: while going up, the elevator walls show you a movie with a recreation of the city and all the changes it has gone through. (And you don't even notice the elevator is moving, so don't be afraid of going up!)All in all, worth spending 32 dollars."

We were transported vertically over 100 floors in less than one minute. The walls of the elevator are a movie showing the evolution of Manhattan from its beginnings to the current day. Really impressive. You step out to a short film presentation, which ends with the \"screen\" lifting away to reveal the most awe inspiring view imaginable. The observation deck can get a little crowded, but it's not terrible. I'd recommend this to anybody visiting New York."

We paid for the iPad guide where you can look at the skyline and click in buildings etc for more info, but it was quite gimmicky and not necessarily of any benefit unless you are a first time visitor. The timed tickets meant it didn't seem overly crowded and you could always get your 'spot' at the window.

There is an entry directly to the observatory from the WTC path station. The elevator up offers a unique time lapse experience, showing the Manhattan skyline view as it has evolved over the years. The elevator takes you up 100 floors in a minute and is supposed to among the fastest in the world. The 360 degree view is great from the 102 floor. Jersey city, Brooklyn bridge, Governors island and ofcourse the skyscrapers. I guess you miss out on some of the uptown views such as central park which might be better from the Empire State building/Rockefeller Centre observatories.

My advice is whatever you do book via the internet prior to going - you can book a time slot. If you can I'd recommend taking either the first slot or close to before the lines build as it took almost an hour to get to the actual deck (I had a lunch time slot and granted it was opening day but I don't think it will be less busy any time soon). Try to also go to the museum while you're in the vicinity its fantastic also. I'd also say try to get to either Top of The Rock or The Empire State Building as both are lower down and you'll get a complimentary look at the city - you're 102 floors up at 1WT so everything is tiny."

Although all of that was cool and seeing the magnificence of the building is neat, I just feel it's way too overpriced just to look out the window. Not only that, but before you get to the observation deck, there are several people there trying to get you to rent an iPad so that you can \"see\" what you're looking at. I don't know if it was $7.50 or $17.50 to rent, either way, you would think that would be something that would be included in the cost of admission. I was disappointed, though my youngest son thought it was awesome to use the bathroom so high up.

It just opened in late May. Lots of friendly staff who are excited to share it. Be sure to use the restroom before going in the elevator as the line is longer up top. The elevator ride is AMAZING!!! Hard to explain - you just have to experience it but it shows a video of NYC over the last 200 years. Once you reach the top (102nd floor) there is another treat when they open up the blinds - WOW!!!! When you proceed down to the 101st floor the staff tries to rent iPads for $15 which are cool, however not really necessary (look over someone's shoulder). There is a nice food concession and gift shop. Plan on spending about 1 hour checking big out the amazing views and the elevator ride down is equally as cool. NOTE: while there is not one mention of 9/11 (they seem to be focusing on future,etc) I found it VERY emotional and my brain kept thinking \"what if...? Those poor souls.... What were their final moments....otherwise, a very cool experience and a must see while in NYC!!!"

Didn't take long at all and the observation deck is excellent with plenty of space to admire the views. Looking down into the memorial pools is quite special and there is so much construction going on in the area.Here's to the Americans for putting up this fantastic tower.

I think it was helpful to purchase tickets in advance and to visit in the morning. The only down side to purchasing in advance is that you cannot predict the weather. We had fabulous views that surpassed the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock views. I found it particularly meaningful to visit this spot. I highly recommend visiting the Tower Observation floor when the weather is clear."

We had the timed skip the line tickets which are probably a must unless you are prepared to waste a lot of time in a queue as this does get busy. (tickets are not cheap by the way) The elevators rise 102 floors in 47 seconds but you have little or no feeling of acceleration or braking. The lift is lined with TV screens so you get an ever changing view of the history of Manhattan shown in its buildings which appear and fade as time elapses. It is a very clever idea but you do not really get enough time to appreciate it because the elevator is so fast. By the way if you want to go direct to the elevators on the skip the line you can but the slower way through is worth it if you have not been before - you then get back into the skip the queue line after that.The view from the top on a clear day is stunning and we were very fortunate that it was a bright sunny day with no haze. If you want to know what you are looking at out of the window you can hire an iPad for an extra $15 which identifies the direction of view from its GPS and displays information on what you are looking at. You are not constrained about the time you spend there whether you are eating in the restaurant at the top or not. About an hour and a bit is probably enough.The ride down is in the same type of elevator with the screens but you appear to be flying down the side of the building."

I visited the One World Observatory yesterday night with my family, it's a great experience, the view of NY and NJ are amazing, after all you're 102 floors up there.The walk through the elevators is pretty nice and informative, they also take a picture of you with the family so they can sell it to you later. Once in the elevator, it goes up there really fast, you have displays inside the elevator and when you reach up there you're shown a movie, when the movie finishes the screen goes up and you see the city. Then they offer you a tablet with a virtual map of the NY, it's $15, in my opinion is not worth it since you just can't see or photograph some of the places you see in the map.Now to the real treat, the view of the city is perfect, from one angle you can see NJ, the Liberty State Park and Downtown Jersey City, from the other Windows you can see the Hudson River and Downtown Manhattan, the best view is when you get to see Midtown and all the Bridges through the windows.My only issue being a Photographer is that the Windows are super reflective, at night it's really hard to get a nice picture without seeing some reflections, I suggest you place your phone, gopro or DSLR against the window and try to cover their area with a hat, a jacket that way the reflections don't show on your pictures or videos, most of the staff were very friendly.Overall its a great experience, I highly recommend you going with your friends, family or love ones, you'll love it.I'm going back with my DSLR but I'm going during the day, most likely before sunset to avoid the window glare."

At $32 for adults and $30 for seniors, I wouldn't tour it daily... but it is a must for either the visitor or the NYC resident.

I think seniors are $30. You might want to go a little early because we got there a little before 10:00 and our tickets were for 12:15. You can also preorder tickets online and choose your day and time. We didn't really know we were going to go up in it before we got there or we probably would have done that.On the elevator ride up, the three walls are actually screens where it shows you the way New York looked in the beginning and, as you went up in floors, it changed as it did over the years to what it looks like today. Very neat. I just wish you could view that somewhere else because it was so quick you can't really take it all in.When you get to the top, they show you a short film about NYC and then you go into the observatory area. As you are going in, they offer for you to rent a tablet that will tell you about all of the buildings and areas that you are looking at from the observatory. That costs an extra $15. We only saw a couple of people with them while we were there. You can walk all around the floor to see all of NYC. It is amazing how small the really tall buildings look from up there. It was very awesome. We would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting NYC. Even if it is a one or two day trip, put it on the list.The only negative is the prices in the gift shop. I would have loved at t-shirt or sweatshirt but most of the shirts were $34.95 and the sweatshirts were $64.95. I saw a sticky note cube that was $21.95. Crazy prices. We didn't buy anything and to be honest, I didn't see many others buying anything either. They would sell a lot more if they brought the prices down a little.This is a must do for anyone visiting NYC."

Souvenir shop sold thirty five dollar t-shirts, forty-five for long sleeved ones. There was a short show & tell presentation.The view of New York City was as breath taking, think Grand Canyon of cities!Unfortunately you are seeing it from behind glass.I usually skip tourist traps like this but because of 9/11, this was a specially personal visit for me. It shows the resilience of the city after such a horrific event.It's too bad that once you get to the top, there was barely a mention of what happened there before. If you don't need to see the city from above, a walk around the building may be an adequate experience. It is a beautiful structure to see from below & the names on the pool are a poignant reminder of 9/11."

From there on it is a very efficiently transition through security and to the elevators. The elevators are super fast and there is a nice show while riding them. I liked how spacious the observatory level is, the layout allows for a smooth flow of visitors wandering around. The view is simply stunning! Souvenirs range from cheaper to pricey, but not much of novelty there. You can stop by the cafeteria, or sit down at the restaurant for a light meal and a drink (prices aren't exorbitant for NY). Staff was very kind! Enough restrooms to not wait in line. One can rent an iPad and learn some more, but if you don't go for that there is not much information about the building, one just enjoys the view. I'd go again after a while - I simply enjoy looking East and thinking of all the people who came to NYC over the hundreds of years, then to the West and see what an incredible city NYC is!"

We had an especially clear day and were able to see the curvature of the Earth - truly amazing! It was busy, but didn't feel crowded and had plenty of rest areas and viewing points.

We arrived early as we had one member of our party that uses a walker. The staff was incredible! Professional, courteous and kind. Thank you Joel for helping us! Take the time once you enter to listen to the sound bite videos of construction workers. Many people were barreling past that to get to the elevators. Once in the elevators you travel through time (depending on where you look you can also watch how many floors you've passedi). Please note: if you have any kind of motion sickness issues keep your eyes closed until you get to the top! A short, dramatic video is given (also watch out motion sickness people) before the curtain is raised for your first glimpse of the view from top floor. It gets a bit gimmicky as you go down a flight and pass the iPad rentals, photo ops against green screen. Food is available for purchase as well as a gift shop. We bypassed all this as we are all native New Yorkers and went around and around to pick out favorite landmarks and discover new areas. Again, staff was very helpful (thank you Ryan from Sunnyside). We spent 2 hours and probably could have stayed longer. A wonderful experience highly recommended."

We visited all 3 Ny main skyscraper attractions during our visit, and this was only just beaten by top of the rock, and it certainly beat empire state. The view is impressive, with floor to ceiling clear glass throughout the observation decks.The restaurant was nice, we had a pleasant light meal, but that was much to do with the fact we lucked out and were sat at window facing table staring out over the city below.We arrived at 2pm and walked straight in, on departing there seemed a 10 minute queue. I wouldnt bother booking. The Ipad hiring was not worth it and would recommend not bothering - they dont work very well keeping compass settings and didnt add much despite our limited NY knowledgeThe animated elevator up just made us laugh. whats the point when the lift was so rammed we could hardly see - great idea, failed in practice.The customer service was very poor, its to be expected at an attraction like this, but the staff seemed disinterested and not concentrating so the confusing arrival queue downstairs was a free for all Tip - Watch the forecast for a sunny day for the best views. if your schedule is flexible then delay deciding what day to visit until you see forecast. Our day was overcast and views were limited to 5 miles - impressive but can imagine could have been better."

It's not just an elevator ride up, it's an experience. From the moment you pass security, which is like airport security including body scans, it's an interactive experiment. Very high tech, when you come in they ask your zip code and at security check there is a huge map of the world and it shows when visitors arrive from different places. The elevator ride is like nothing I've ever seen. It's fast, smooth, and wall to wall video screens, I won't spoil the surprise but the ride up is unreal. Then you watch a short video which culminates in a grand view of the city. It's spectacular! You won't be disappointed!"

The whole area around the building and the entrance to the attraction is kind of sober. Concrete, rock, rather on the cold side, to give a solemn impression in memory of 9/11. Queueing system quite efficient (recommend buy ticket online, very easy), and while you wait for the elevator, a voice starts talking about a \"Skypod\". It is still an elevator. But it has these screens from floor to ceiling on three sides which show different movies going up and going down. EXCELLENT, WELL DONE! Wanted to take just the elevator half a dozen times to be able to absorb the whole things, as it goes really fast. Of course up there the view is breathtaking as to be expected. Only point of small complaint, why can they not have non-reflective windows? While taking pictures it is very difficult to remove the reflections of the people around you or yourself. Even a pol filter on the lens does not take them away. Other positive note, they have some guys telling stories of NYC and what you see, using combination of different screens, video and their narrative. Nicely done too."

Constructed as the new symbol of this city, this modern skyscraper has a lot of wow factor both inside and out. Traveling to the One World Observatory is easy as the building is in close proximity to a few subway stations like Cortland street, Chambers street and Fulton Street. There is no missing this building upon exiting as it simply dominates the down town skyline. Making my way there is interesting as one goes thru a heavily guarded underpass and then make it to security. The tower management employs airport style security and all bags were screened. I have a VIP ticket and makes it thru the queue faster but if you are not going to the Observatory during peak period, I don\u2019t think that is necessary as there is a small difference in time. Going up the express elevator is very cool, as the lift itself comprises of a wrap around LCD video screen that shows the transformation of New York from the last century until present. Once insider the observatory, we were shown a few videos and also offered the opportunity to have our photos taken. The observatory itself has a gift shop and a restaurant and of course they are all overpriced.The views are spectacular for sure as the observatory has a 360 deg view of New York city from downtown, including the Statue of Liberty, the Hudson river and the Brooklyn bridge. As sunlight give away to evening night falls, the view gets more spectacular with all the lights on. This is where one notice NYC really have a traffic jam problem. :DAny drawbacks? Yes of course. First there are huge crowds as this observatory is new and it gets bigger by the minute once reaching the prime \u201csunset\u201d timing. The crowd seems to be dominated by two group of people. First are the couples that choose to occupy certain vantage points of the observatory and refuse to move, thus depriving others of a closer view while they wait for sunset and kiss and snorkel affectionally for all to see. I suppose that \u201cadds\u201d to the view but doing so is very selfish and irritating. Then you have a lot of what I supposed are professional photographs and enthusiast that take seemingly ages to take a picture. Lastly, the glass windows are highly reflective so it\u2019s very hard to take a good picture and I have to jostle with the crowd for a spot. I have to choose certain special spots where the lighting in the room doesn\u2019t reflect badly to damage the view. See the attached pictures. By around 8:45pm ( Sunset is at 8:30pm ), the place is swarming with people and it gets too much and too crowded and I cannot wait to leave the place. Going down is quick and doesn\u2019t have a long queue fortunately. Overall, I enjoyed the Top of the Rock experience better due to open unblocked views vs the glass windows of the One World, and a small crowd makes it much more relaxing."

Recommend getting as early of a time slot as you can, as the observation levels will get crowded. Having timed entry made it really convenient, as you don't have to wait in a long line to get in. Simply show up 15 minutes before your time slot and then get in the line for your time. Very cool \"movie\" going up the elevator (goes very quickly) and then excellent views from the top."

If you're locked into a time and the visibility is low, it's a wasted experience. It's also worth it to skip the queues, although you still have to queue up to get back down.Despite my cynicism about the process, it's a beautiful building that stands out in New York, and worth the trip to the top for the views of the city."

I was curious to see how this was going to be. Now recently opened, the talk of this observatory is the elevator ride and of course the view at the top. There was a surprisingly short wait at the bottom outside of about 20 minutes after we purchased tickets inside the building. We didn't do any advance purchase. The price is a bit steep ($32), but it's NYC. The elevator ride up was very interesting, showing NYC from the 1600's, and as you rise up higher in the building, the time changes as is shown on a date counter in the elevator. The higher up you go you see the city change as taller building are built, and familiar buildings also go up. Before you know it you are at the top. You exit and there is a great view all around. There were a few issues I really wish the staff here would address. One, they cannot do much about. The lighting inside causes a lot of glare on the glass and makes taking pictures of the great view rather tough. The other is the number of people sitting around on the window sills at every point of the observatory. I was on top trying to get photo's for about an hour, and noticed that the entire time, many areas had the same people sitting in the blocking the view and locations to get good shots. Many times these people didn't even move when you moved up closer to the glass, and I was forced to lean over them to take pictures. It was very annoying. You might think after sitting in a window for 10-15 minutes these people would have moved just to let others get a view and or photo's, but many of the same people I saw at the beginning, were also in the same place at the end. There are some areas that are not as bright from the ceiling lights as others, or are away from the lights from different displays, and it seemed these are the areas these people sat the longest without moving. I heard several people talking about this. The staff really need to get these people out from sitting in the window sills, so others can get better shots. Other than these two things, the ride up I'd say is worth it."

We got there earlier than our 12.30pm entry time and had a drink in FiDi beforehand which was a pleasant area. I must advise that the system in place for directing people where to go is INSANE! All they need at the front is a couple of signs that say - Pre Booked Tickets or Buy Tickets Here to clearly mark each line. hat you have in fact is just a mass of people who have no idea which line to join or what to do. Therefore everyone who is working for WTC at the front gets constantly bombarded by questions from the public about where they should go and what they should do. Craziness. For your reference the queue on the right (facing the entry to One WTC) by the security booth is for tickets to buy today, the queue on the left which is by the steps is for pre booked tickets. The same is true for the actual entry when you have pre booked. People join the lines ahead of their schedule times and someone has to organise them via a Megaphone (is this 2015?) to sort them into their timed entries. In the blazing hot sunshine this was just too much to handle what should have been an exciting occasion. Being one of the first people up to the WTC observatory should have started on a better foot.I don't want to ruin the surprise of your visit here so I will keep the running order of the visit secret, but I can say that the trip to the top is around 60 seconds to the 100th floor which is amazing!The actual views themselves are out of this world. Loving NYC and everything about the city it was really emotional to be there in One WTC and everything it stands for - absolutely amazing. We didn't dine here after seeing the Eater reviews and also the hassle from entry and mingling of all the visitor upstairs which put us off staying any longer. I would advise not to miss the opportunity to go up and see the views and support the observatory. You won't regret it. I just hope they sort their queueing system out sooner rather than later."

This means that they have a steady flow of people throughout the day and the tower doesn't get too crowded at any point . The trip in the lift to the observatory at the top was amazing - the lift has projected images on each wall so it looks as though you are in a glass lift and can see all around NYC as you travel higher. The observatory itself was great, offering unrivalled 360 views across the city - better than both the Empire State and Rockerfeller centre. Back to that lift again...on the way down , again it offered similar views as on the ascent , but it actually felt more like a theme park ride. The lift 'appeared' to leave the tower and spiral around the outside of the tower like something out of Charlie and the chocolate factory! Well worth the entry fee. At the base of the tower are the two memorial pieces where the original tower1 and tower 2 stood along with the only tree in the square that survived 9/11. Other trees have been planted around it since, but the original is chunkier and has a small fence around it so is easy to spot. Would recommend a visit to this site."

I studied the reviews on here and became worried about the wait in lines so I purchased \"expedited entry\" tickets for anytime that week. There was absolutely no need to do that or spend that much money! Not only was there no line outside for tickets, there was no line inside for the regular or VIP elevators. You walked directly into the elevators! It was very organized from entrance to the building to when you were in the observatory. The staff was informative. While skies were not a totally clear blue, you certainly had great views. My grandsons (ages 14, 10, and 8) found it easy to get to the windows to take their own pictures.

The glass is not clear enough and there are reflections from everything that make good photos difficult to take. There are great views and obviously it is downtown, but I feel that most people, like myself, went up this tower in memory of those who died. That is perfectly fine, but don't milk it too much in the shop and all around. Decent, but not as good as it should be."

The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is down to our treatment by the bar staff at the observatory bar. As honeymooners, my husband and I fancied a drink at the top of the world and made our way to the bar. We found a seat, checked the menu and not finding any staff on hand to take our order, my husband went to the bar to purchase our drinks. I then had a staff member appear to tell me that I couldn't sit here and that since he had placed his order at the bar we must sit at the bar. I explained that I didn't realise this was the etiquette and offered to cancel our bar order and place it with the waitress. The bar staff said that it didn't matter and that we should enjoy our drinks at our table so we took our seats and thanked them. A few minutes later, another waitress came and told us that we couldn't sit here and when I explained what has happened she said well 'you shouldn't have been told that and you cannot sit here' and stood over us at our table. Not one for being intimidated, I apologised for the misunderstanding in the service etiquette but told her that we would be finishing our drinks where we were. The waitress's parting shot was 'well next time you will know how it works here' We were allowed to then finish our drinks but it did take the shine off of what should have been a very special moment. Little did she know that this was our 'once-in-a-lifetime' holiday and there may never be a 'next time'. Despite all this hoo-hah, we loved the observatory and the views over Manhattan were stunning! A total must see."

Two of us had been to the old World Trade Center observatory 3 or more times before it fell victim to the terrorist attack. It is amazing how fast the elevators take you all the way up to the 102nd floor of One World Trade Center. They start with a very good video presentation and then you go down an escalator to the observation floor where you can get views from all side of the building. You are on your own and can stay for as long as you wish. They offer souvenirs for purchase in a small shop and you can go to a nice restaurant with great views on another food if you wish. Unlike the old World Trade Center, you cannot go outside in the open air on the roof. They are extremely efficient. It is amazing how easily they handle such large crowds in a friendly but efficient manner. A Tip: Buy your tickets on the Internet. Saves standing in line."

Nice and clear day made it all worth the wait.

Note: if you have tickets for a certain time, it's okay if you get there a bit late- they will just let you in. We were there too early b/c I had to guess when we were arriving in NYC so we waited, but there were lots of earlier time people and the kids were hungry, so we ended up leaving to grab a quick bite to eat- that then made us about 8 minutes late, for our 'noon' time, but as I mentioned, they let us right in. Once in, they have you queue up (think Disney) in a line and have done an okay job of making the line interesting by posting things on walls, videos, etc... Eventually you make your way around to the elevators. I didn't think the elevator was as 'interesting' as I thought it'd be. I appreciated its speed. And our ears popped on the way up. Once you're at the top, they show you another short video. While the video is nice, they have an even better surprise at the end. No spoilers here. Then they finally let you into the 'viewing' areas. We didn't partake in the gift shop or food- just the views. And they really are spectacular. It was crowded, but not ridiculously so. That said, I have a tip, (insert image of Bill Lumbergh here), if you could please be courteous of other people and not sit against the window ledge blocking other people from checking out the views while you scroll through the photos you took with your friend - \"that'd be great\".I definitely think it's a must at least once."

Tickets were $185 each, which included viewing from 8:00 PM till 10:00 PM with open bar, hot dogs and soft pretzels (a tradition). We choose this since we were not comfortable viewing the fireworks in a crowd and we wanted to see One World. Why not do both at one time! First, security around and in One World was good; like airport security. We felt very safe. The view of NYC from the observatory is 360 degrees...the best you will find anywhere. Food and drink were plentiful and good. There were some lines at the start of the night for food and drink. We thought for the price we paid, they could have had better access to the food and bars (who wants to wait too long at that price!) The fireworks show seemed small from so high up. Also, you didn't get the sound effects so it did diminish the event a bit. We wish they would have piped in the sounds of the fireworks. Would have made a big difference. Instead, they piped in the event going on in Times Square. Overall, very interesting experience for the 4th of July. Worth doing once in your life. If visiting NYC, One World is a must see. Tickets anytime for Observatory are, of course, much less expensive than the 4th special event."

(Empire State building, Central Park)One guy actually pushes people out of the way without saying excuse me so he can do his rubbish speech!There's the \"restaurant/cafe\" with fifty tables and ten chairs!!!And then when you've done it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack looking for the exit!!All this for the princely sum of $32 each!!I'd say if you want to go up a high building in Manhattan try the Rockafeller or Empire State Building."

Unfortunately for us the clouds were low and visibility was zero. If you purchase tickets ahead, you are out of luck. The elevator ride was nice, among the fastest in the world.

I am reviewing One World Observatory for the singular reason I decided to go up - to enjoy the view and reflect on what the Freedom Tower means. The views are incredible, first of all. There is a 360-degree view of New York from the main observation level, and my favorite vantage point was absolutely the view toward Midtown. Astonishing. I couldn't snap enough pictures, especially since it was morning and the angle of the sun kept changing. (Tip: If you are interesting in great photos, go early and head straight for the north side, there was no glare or reflection on the window at that time.)Like I mentioned, I also went up to reflect. For any American, your first time up to the observatory should not be judged upon the price for a water or a ticket, or the lack of seating or the fact that it is not an open-air observatory. Save these critiques for your second or third time, and the let observatory age a bit. The main reason to go up is to look out over New York from this spot, look down in the pools where the former Trade Centers stood, and reflect. For a purely emotional experience, One World Observatory is absolutely can't-miss for any visitor to New York.To give you something to consider, I decided to pay extra for expedited entry. I walked right in past a huge line of general admission tourists and families, and was the 5th person through the security line. I arrived at 9am and was exiting the elevator at the top by 9:15. I was able to have the observatory practically to myself for about 15-20 minutes before the crowds filled the space. For an extra $20 as a solo traveler, it was worth it to me.If you're visiting New York, just go. Save your critiques of the smaller details for a repeat visit, and don't go up for the wrong reasons. Enjoy the view. Reflect. Appreciate it. That's why you're there."

First of all, I had a ticket for 4:15pm that day, and reached the top level within 15 minutes from the ticket time, which is quite impressive considering the new staffs and all the processes (it took me like an hour for me to get to the top of Empire State Building few years ago). This was possible mostly due to the presence of several high speed elevators.The observatory itself offers an impressive 360 degree view of New York City (and Jersey City). The side of the observatory that face most of the Manhattan was slightly more crowd than the other sides, which is kind of understandable. The window panes are not anti-reflection though, so you have to get your camera really close to the window to avoid reflection. Another minor negative point about this place is that everything is a little bit too commercialize from the online ticketing add-on offer and people trying to sell us the add-on package again when we reached the top."

You can buy admission tickets for a certain admission day and time for $32 or buy a ticket that allows you entry at any time of day ($65 weekdays) There is a security checkpoint (naturally) just like an airport before boarding the elevators. The elevators are said to be the fastest in the world - 102 floors in under 60 seconds.Once you are at the observation floor, the views are breathtaking. The windows are floor to ceiling 360 degrees. It's very easy to get photos of almost any landmark in New York if you have a powerful enough zoom. You are allowed to stay as long as you like. There's a gift shop with overpriced trinkets (only 3 different style of coffee mug - all expensive and all ugly!) and a restaurant.Even though it's pricey, I believe that it's a must-see attraction when visiting Manhattan."

The bar was very busy and with the concrete floor, all the glass and the hard surface ceiling the background noise level was very high, also no music, and I think they turned it off as it just adds to the noise. The bar staff was very friendly and the drinks and the cheese plate we had was very good, pricey, but hey, on the 102nd floor that's expected.... We had to wait at the bar for a table and once a coupe left we had to fend for it as another couple tried to swoop in a take it, but once I told them we've been waiting for it for almost 30 minutes they backed off.

I was skeptical about the system but it was flawless going up. The queuing system was excellently executed and the building is nothing less than extraordinary. The inclusion of images, video and voice overs from those involved in the project is very well done and reinforces the cooperation required to deliver the building and experience. This is all the more poignant given the history of the site. You can't help but feel emotional and in awe of their achievement in building the observatory. The trip up in the elevator was incredible as a video presentation fills the walls of the space chronicling the development of NYC over the past 100 or so years. The iPad viewing option at the top was also helpful and we certainly enjoyed it (was worth the extra $15). Of course, there was all the usual merchandise to buy at the top which gets on my nerves a little bit and the food was crazy expensive which made me mad and would have excluded many families. Having said that, I guess you just need to suck that up and enjoy the experience. The only down side to our visit was leaving the observatory. Something was amiss with their systems as it took almost an hour of us waiting in line for an elevator to get down. This was the one part of the experience that let it all down. We were cranky by the time we reached the elevator as were others. Overall, it still beats the pants off the Empire State Building experience which is a completely flawed process and needs serious review. That ride is also completely dated and should be revamped or ditched completed (will review that next!)."

It was quite busy but that's to be expected, had tickets booked for 2000hrs but didn't make it to the elevator until 2030 and almost missed the sunset. Protip, if you're trying to get up for the sunset plan on getting up there an hour before so even with delays you will get up there in time to catch it. Also, there are metal detectors and X-rays to go through so review the prohibited items list before leaving your hotel."

There was a lot of time and creativity that went into the creation of this observatory, from the walkway through Manhattan schist and the incredible elevator tour, to the 360 degree views. The City Pulse presentations that focused on all things NYC were also really a great touch. There were definitely enough windows all around for us to get a great view of any angle we wanted, even with the number of people that visited. The elevator ride was so cool - they have images on the walls as you ascend which take you through the history of NYC's development in less than a minute, and from pre-historic to current day. The descending video in the elevator takes you outside the Freedom Tower and made it seem like we were in a helicopter, circling the tower to take in the building from all different angles. The one surprising and disappointing thing was there wasn't any information on the building itself and the background about its build, the relationship to the WTC, whether there was any particular reason for the 102 floors, the overall design of the building, etc. We hope the One World Observatory puts something together about this amazing building and how it came to be, given the 9-11 Memorial site just next door."

The relentless up-sell of iPad apps, staged photographs and assorted souvenirs is tacky in the worst commercial way.

We didn't and there was another 30 minute wait inside.3. Make sure you have suncream and water for the queue. We went on a scorching day in July and the outside queue is very exposed.4. If you want to be sneaky, go across the road and enter from the underground entrance from Brookfield Place. Time it right though. We did this accidentally, but turned up 20 minutes before our time; they sent us to queue up outside as we were early.Good trip, and good value for money, but you have to be organised to make the most of it.

My 10 year old spent lots of time doing just that and studying the city. The presentation value of the elevator ride and entertainment/education at the top are top notch. Where the visit fell short was with employees who were in charge of moving people through the line and up/down the elevators. They seemed to be confused about who was supposed to be doing what and how the flow of the visitors was to proceed. One of many examples: We paid for the fast pass (well worth the money) and were not properly directed in where to go. We had to fend for ourselves and find our own way even after attempting to get the attention of employees. The One World Observatory could certainly learn a lesson from the Empire State Building in this regard."

The tower was great, but it is all indoors, it would be better if there was an outdoor level like the Empire State Building has.

You hold the iPad at whatever you're looking at and it will tell you what you're looking at. To try to force you into renting the iPad, their wifi kindly blocks access to Apple maps, Google maps, the app store and others - and don't think that you can just use your data plan because chances of getting a 3G or 4G signal up there is slim...Other than that, really - go on a clear day - you can see for about 100 miles.

On a Monday afternoon in June we visited the new One World Observatory, and I would encourage you to wait.We waited in a queue to buy tickets, but if you bought them online you could skip this queue. The we waited in our time queue (every 15 minutes supposedly) to get into the building. Then we waited in a queue to go through security. Then we waited in a queue to get on the elevators. The we waited in a queue to see a short vidoe before being admitted to the observatory.All in all it was nearly 2 hours to get in to see what we wanted to see. We walked around the 4 compass views and took some pics (always waiting for others to clear out because it was CROW DED DUH)! After just under and hour, we bypassed the high priced drink and snack offerings as well as the gift area and waited 40 minutes- (you guessed it!) in another queue for the elevators to get out..Now, in all fairness the queues were well managed and moved steadily if slowly. The issue was the mass of humanity attempting entrance. The employee at the elevator said they process 10,000 visitors a day.One cool feature is the elevator to the top. All the walls are large view screens. As it starts the elevator ascends it simulates the development of New York City from undeveloped land into present day as you come to a stop. At the same time it portrays a simulated view of the outside as if you were in a glass elevator on the exterior of the building. Pretty cool, but I'd love to do it in slow motion to take it all in.The views at the observatory are impressive as they usually are in such a place. You can see all of the harbour, past Staten Island and the bridge, out to the Atlantic. You can see all three bridges to Brooklyn and Queens, and out past the airports. You can see across the Hudson and Sully's landing spot, the far into New Jersey. To the north is is just a bit disappointing as you can only really see up to the cluster of buildings around and including the Empire State Building. This means you cannot see more than a sliver if any of Central Park and more in that direction. If that is of interest, and it should be to get in ALL of NYC, I would suggest going up in the Empire State Building instead. It's about the same price, less crowded, less waiting and a bit more comprehensive a view.it was interesting to see nearly 2 dozen cranes and projects ongoing, and there were more green spaces in Manhattan that I would have thought. Also, unlike many observatories there were no fixed or adjustable telescopes to use to see things in closer view.So, if you're going to put this on your itinerary, buy tickets online and be prepared for the queues of your life!"

I thought it was called Freedom Tower, anyway, whatever it is called, it is well worth a visit.We started at the Memorial pools and then went around the corner to the entrance of the Freedom Tower. There is a line to buy tickets or you can do it online. The line wasn't long at all. We bought our tickets outside on the net and proceeded inside. We went on July 6 at 4pm and there were hardly any people around. It certainly wasn't crowded. There is the usual security screenings similar to an airport. Also the phones don't work so take a photo of your tickets if you have bought them on line. After you clear security you are shepherded to a lift that takes you up to floor 102. The lift has a timeline of the NYC skyline which is really interesting. The lift is quick and not at all scary. When you arrive at 102 you are again corralled in an area to watch a video about the building. This was fine for us as it wasn't busy but I can imagine it would be awful with loads of people. The best bit is the end of the video. I'm not going to spoil it.Then you descend two floors to level 100 and it is a panoramic view of New York, Brooklyn and New Jersey. There are floor to ceiling windows all the way around. It is quite breathtaking. My only complaint is that they have some advertising directly at North which blocks the view of uptown and everyone is trying to take photos from a small space to the side. There is, of course, a gift shop with the ubiquitous t shirts and caps etc. You can stay as long as you like, there is no ushering you on once you are on the 100. It was quite an experience and I highly recommend it."

Lift took about 30 seconds to reach the top.Very slick presentation for about 5 minutes then uninterrupted spectacularly jaw-dropping views of the city and beyond. Reasonably priced cafe and gift shop.The one big drawback is once you are up there, there are massive queues for the lift down. So my advice would be join the lift queue sooner rather than later, as you can admire the views as you advance in the line.Definitely not to be missed."

The One World Observatory was one of the first things we have visited in New York and it is still one of my favourite things to see and do ! We've booked the tickets a little bit in advance in order to jump the queue (there are a lot of tourists in June and summer season in general, so you should either get up early or buy the tickets in advance if you don't want to wait forever). This is the most recent observation tower built in Manhattan and they have used the most recent technology to impress visitors from the beginning to the end of the visit. I do not want to say too much but the elevator ride is definitely worth it and the observatory deck gives you a 360\u00b0 view over the South of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Liberty Island and Jersey City. Even though it is not an open air observation deck as the one of the Rockefeller Center, you still have a beautiful view from behind the glasses."

It is difficult to give a rating of less than excellent because of the accomplishment of rebuilding such a stunning structure. The history behind the construction and stories told by those involved await you as you prepare for your ascent to the top. The staff was very helpful in advising you to the possible observatory viewing limitations due to the weather. The weather was a factor the day we visited, but we knew it would be the only time we could visit. The exhibits on the lower level and interactive presentations about NYC at the observation level enhance the visiting experience even when your view of the city is limited due to the uncooperative weather. The elevators are unique because the surrounding walls from top to bottom are a constant changing image of the NY City skyline dating from the wilderness area in previous centuries to the current day image as the elevator reaches the top in less than 80 seconds. The 9-11 Memorial and Museum are in the immediate vicinity with long lines which prompted us to choose the observatory. We found that there were plenty of tickets available online for access within the next 15 minutes (the tickets are for a timed entrance) to the observatory without having to purchase in advance. You will have several purchasing options to move ahead of the line, but we found that there was no line so we saved almost 50% by buying the cheapest ticket offered. The bathroom facilities are the cleanest you will find in NYC!"

We overnight in NY frequently and always like to try something new so we reserved times for the observatory online. Our reservation was for 12:30. Keep in mind that you won't be able to access the line more that a half hour before your timed ticket and the line is in direct afternoon sun. So choose your day and time carefully. We were lucky it was cloudy since the weather was hot and we did not wait outside more than 20 minutes. The lines moved quickly, security process was efficient and staff very helpful. I have to say that you should not read the reviews that share too much info before you go so that you will have a couple surprises in store. LOVED the elevator (surprise #1) and those lines also moved very quickly both up and down. After getting off the elevator you file into a room that shows a short clip of NY then (surprise #2) and off into the observatory you go. There are also gift shops and a restaurant. This building has the best views I have ever seen. Wait to book tickets until you can plan around the weather for a good day but even in heat, view was fantastic and whoever designed this building definitely deserves an award. One last suggestion, when exiting the elevator and before you go up the escalator there are doors which lead out to a hallway which will eventually lead to the Bus, Subway, Path hub which is under construction. If the sign is not up to prohibit your entry, take a sneak peak and some great picks. It is a beautifully designed, futuristic piece of architecture!!!"

The experience is amazing! It literally is a journey to the top, with videos from first responders and survivors of 9/11 as you make your way to the elevator. Even the elevator is amazing, and keeps you entertained whilst you travel 102 floors. All the staff were really nice and enthusiastic and made you feel VIP. Then it is time for the big reveal! Everything about the experience is very hi tech, with the iPads available (extra $15) to zoom in on the view to tell you about what you are seeing. There is also 'The Buzz' with staff talking about the history of NYC & things to do in the city. It was nice to have staff walking around on hand to ask questions about particular buildings. There is a restaurant and bar up the top as well, which I thought was really cool and the prices didn't look too bad. It was nice to see the city from a different perspective, as you are downtown. You are closer to the Statute of Liberty and Ellis Island and Jersey. If you are looking to see other iconic buildings, such as the Empire State, you can only see if from a distance, whereas you would see it closer up Top of the Rock. Overall a great iconic building to visit. Nice to be in a building all shiny and new with great views."

Escalators don't work well for wheel chairs. So, you are directed to wander through the service hallways to find elevators that go between 102, 101 & 100. So, you go through an unlocked door marked, \"No Admittance.\" Each time, some one pops out of an office and offers to help. But, it's clear that the One World Trade Center plan for a staff member to escort the disabled doesn't work. I suggest the lead architect try to use a wheel chair for a week to broaden his horizon.

It is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere, and the fourth-tallest in the world........what an outstanding piece of architecture! We visited early July having prebooked tickets, paying $32 each adult and $26 for our 10 year old son. I thought that this was rather expensive at the time, but I was SO wrong - it was worth every single cent - IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE and I cannot recommend it highly enough to you. On booking, you select a timed ticket, but be aware, you will need to arrive 15 minutes prior to entry time in order to queue.Entry is swift and efficient though with the usual airport type security screening. Baggage size is limited and no food or drink can be taken in - so I advise you to familiarise yourself with any restrictions prior to your visit Restrooms are available inside at the bottom of the lifts. The elevators are FANTASTIC and show images of the growth of NYC during the 1 minute ascent. The lift travels at 7 miles per hour, but you do not notice it. On reaching the top visitors are treated to a wonderful film show on a series of screens which is quite amazing. When it finishes the screens rise to reveal the first glimpse of the view!!!Then it is time to enter the 360degree observation deck. There are no words to describe the view - you MUST go and see for yourself. There are 'educators' on hand at a couple of points, who use a collection of interactive screens to inform visitors about many different aspects of NYC. They were excellent and well worth stopping to listen to. In addition, it is possible to hire an interactive information tablet to use as your own personal guide as you go round at your own pace. To hire this guide costs just $15 and can be useful to the whole family. There is also a cafe and a restaurant at the observation deck - pricy, but that's what you'd expect. Similarly the gift shop falls into that category too!Now, I'd advise a morning visit as there were certainly more people waiting to enter when we came out than there had been when we entered at 10.30am. This attraction far outshines the Empire State Building in my opinion. At the top of the ESB there are SO many people that it can be difficult to make your way to the front to see. The Top of the Rock is better than the Empire State Building in opinion, but One World Trade Centre outshines them both as there is plenty of room, fewer people, and some incredible photo opportunities. Don't hesitate in visiting, I'm certain you'll enjoy it!I hope this helped."

There are also periodic \"360 shows\" which are informative, and amazing usung multiple screens arranged in a cire- this is free and worth your time.

Once through security you get into the elevator. Once you are in the elevator the experience begins, the elevator appears to be a glass elevator with a 360 degree view of NYC skyline as you go up. It's actually a really well done LCD screens surrounding you, but it gives the appearance that the elevator is on the outside of the building, but it's in the middle.Once you get out of the elevator you assemble around a window that has like a movie screen in front of it, a short 3-4 minute video is played then the screen and drapes/curtains come up with it revealing the awesome view, such an excellent effect.The observatory is actually down a ramp to the next floor and it circulates the whole building. iPads are available for hire as an audio/visual tour for a few dollars. If not there are 2 small stages that are at opposite corners of the building running constant talks on tourist type topics.There is a restaurant up there, we didn't go in as it looked like a fine dining affair and that's not our style. The gift store is also up there and they have a good range of gifts, although they are a little on the pricey side.The views are stunning, the financial district skyline view is really second to none, get great views of the islands (Liberty, Ellis etc) and both rivers (Husdon and East).My advice is do this trip before it becomes really popular. We were able to go in with no wait time and also move freely in the observatory due to lack of people, this won't be like this forever."

Once at the top, we were brought to an area where we stood to view a movie about NYC on a multidimensional screen. Spoiler alert: once the movie ends, the entire screen is raised to reveal a breathtaking view of the city. Dramatic music made the \"reveal\" a real spectacle. We were then escorted to an area where we were offered interactive tablets to carry around to learn about neighborhoods and iconic sights. Only downside, once we took the tablet, we were then informed that it would cost an extra $15 to use. No sign or indication of an additional fee. It was worth the cost if you're not familiar with NYC. It allows you to point the tablet at any point of the 360\u2022 floor-to-ceiling windows and explains what neighborhood you're looking at and any landmarks. Fabulous! We didn't eat in the sit-down restaurant, but did have a snack at the snack bar, offering everything from sushi to franks to hot gourmet sandwiches. All in all, an extremely uplifting activity, particularly after the somber experience of the 911 Memorial."

If you get there a little before sunset, you get to watch the city come to life at night, as the lights on the other landmark buildings come on. It was disappointing that there were no legends to show what part of the city you were looking at. You have to rent an ipad for that. If you are a native New Yorker, you can pretty much figure out where everything is but would have been nice to have some signage. There is a pricey gift shop (what else is new) and three restaurants. One restaurant has fast food, another has small plates and the third is supposed to be the upscale restaurant. It is pricey. The food is good but the ambiance is not. The noise from downstairs, where he observation deck is, is very loud and the restaurant overlooks an exhibit with lights that are distracting and presentations that are loud. So much so that you have trouble hearing your company. Very poor designing for the location of the upscale restaurant."

Staff friendly and there is a cafe at the top with a decent selection and reasonable prices. Hired an iPad with an app which pointed out landmarks and then 'flew' you to them with background information - paid I think 15 dollars but we didn't use it much as we were limited time-wise. loved it!

First, you need a reservation time, easily done on-line. This is not only necessary, but you will find, unlike other tourist draws like ESB, Top of the Rock, Statute of Liberty, there is no long line to way in, either getting or getting out. Visitors are ushered in in 15-minute intervals, and of course, you can stay as long as you want, all day if you wish. The scheduling is a great idea, but the attraction itself would be worth any wait time. There are photo ops that you will find nowhere else. The history of the building, in fact the past 500-year history of Manhattan, is flashed on the walls of the elevator during your ascent to the top of the 100-102 floor. So, the short version is this: GO! See it for yourself and marvel at what a world we live in that a building like this can be a reality."

The ride up is just 60 seconds in elevators whose walls are video screens that show a virtual reality video as you ride up, taking you on a chronological view of Manhattan's growth & progress throughout the years. Once you step out of the elevator you realize you are close to heaven. Your ear may pop as you go up. Don't forget your camera. The observatory area is quite ample and you may move around the building though all cardinal points. They have restrooms, a restaurant, seating area, a bar, and souvenir shop. Since they are practically new, they may need a bit of more organization. We arrived there around 11:00 a.m. on a sunny Monday. There were confusing groups of people outside and we had to ask. It turned out that there was a line to buy tickets and a line of people who already bought the tickets waiting to get in. The lines moved fairly quickly, but this was a slow day, as evidenced by several other unused closed roped lines. This is all outside. I wonder what would you do if you go on a rainy day. However, they sell priority tickets for a higher fee so your wait isn't that long. In the Empire State Building the lines are indoors. I suggest they build some roofed waiting area outside for really hot or rainy days or figure out a way to do this waiting indoors. There's no parking, so you will have use nearby parking lots."

While their wasn't as much effort put in in terms of presentation at Rockefeller, it did feel like One World needed all the extra flash to make up for the fact that it wasn't quite as impressive as Rockefeller I felt. I do recommend this but if you're only going to do one observatory in NYC I'd personally pick Top of the Rock as they are both at a similar price level."

The lifts to 102 floor are pretty good - the 'reveal' show is ok - but it is all a bit sanitised. You need to be behind glass but taking photos is hard. I would;t go back. Just a tick in the box and an expensive one at that!"

The NYC Freedom Tower observatory design is very contemporary, much more spacious and of course view is superior as NYC architecture has longer history and many outstanding older skyscrapers. The famous imaginative elevator ride through time is amazingly fast and do not allow enough time to see what exactly changes over the centuries since Europeans purchased the island. The entrance corridor with multiple screens presenting people involved in designing and building of the Tower is very moving and well done.Also, view of the Hudson, East river, Brooklyn bridge etc is incredible. It's quite amazing to see reflections of the passing boats in the middle of skyscrapers. We live not far from Manhattan and work there, so we know the most of the landmarks. But devices that one can rent and point at the windows to see the major landmarks on the screen with the names next to them must be very useful for the visitors from the other parts of the country and abroad.The buffet on the 101st floor is quite overpriced ... but it is to be expected. The restrooms on the 100 floor are too small for the crowds, even men's has a line. But ones on the bottom floor are empty.I would like to come again during the dark time to see all city aglow,"

In every corner and niche of the observation deck is an amazing, unobstructed view of Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Empire State Building, the Statute of Liberty, the bridges, landmark of where the twins use to be, the views are endless. We pre-bought timed tickets and found the line to move along quite quickly and efficiently. It also didn\u2019t feel so rushed and crowded and you could linger a bit to take photos.

Ms. Jean van Burren and I live in New York City, and we dine at nice restaurants fairly often, so we were anxious to experience One Dine, hoping that it would be similar to the Windows on the World experience that one could have at the former World Trade Towers. WE CERTAINLY HAD NO SUCH EXPERIENCE.First one must navigate through another restaurant and arrive at a very unprepossessing entrance to Dine One. When we were seating, we were given menus which showed a fixed price of $75 per person. That's not a bad price at a fine restaurant, and as it turns out the food at Dine One was splendid. We loved all of it, but it was spoiled by the ambiance. The tiny dining area is on a balcony overlooking the loud tourist observatory of the 100th floor. I have nothing against such areas, I just don't want to be Immersed in them while I'm trying to have a fine meal. IT REALLY WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF BEING IN A MACDONALDS. Lectures were being given below about the history of New York City, and we couldn't hear each other speak. Constant tourist traffic below was terribly distracting. Also the decor is deplorable. I know designers of fast food restaurants who do better. WHO PLANNED THAT RESTAURANT? I'M AN ARCHITECT, AND I'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THE PLACE IS EITHER AN AFTERTHOUGHT, OR ITS DESIGN WAS SLASHED FOR BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS. I AM TELLING EVERYONE I KNOW THAT THE RESTAURANT IS A DISASTER BEST LEFT UNVISITED.John Szubski"

We booked our tickets on-line with selection of the time when we can go (better option to wait in line and then get tickets especially when traveling with children) and preferred the evening time so we could capture some good pictures with lights and city skyline. The ride to the top with the \"new generation elevators\" speeding you through the history of NY city is a good kick for children. Views from the top are surely spell-bounding but facility in itself can do a lot more for the price they charge for admission. It does not take much to keep some benches on the floor for elderly and families with children to take a break and enjoy the views instead of sitting on the floor vents and preventing others from coming closer to the glass windows to take in the views and photos. You have to pay a fee to get gadgets that tell you the landmarks you can see... it can easily be made free by posting sign boards atop the roof on what you see from where you are. Overall we wouldn't call it a \"must\" to see but then can you really leave such a historical event place without seeing/experience it??"

Was a weeknight and were able to get up right away as it was later, about 7p and a bit questionable on rain. Have inner ear problems and worried about 102 floors in 60 seconds. Took decongestants before the elevator ride. I think perhaps that the elevator is pressurized somehow because my ears hardly bothered me and the ride took, as promised, 60 seconds. The \"video\" that displayed on the walls of the elevator as you ascended was fantastic and I really wish the ride had taken longer, or been able to view it again with nobody blocking it. Upon arrival at the top we were herded, again, to watch a video / show on the wall. We were hungry and needed to use the bathroom and didn't want to be held in a holding area watching another presentation. Plus, we were too close up front (the only position you could be because it's standing only) to appreciate the entire thing. Well, you have to go for the surprise after it was over. WOW. Well worth it. I understood why. Then, found the bathroom (several and adequately sized) and then wanted to eat. 3 options - snack type stuff, make while you wait (outstanding - many choices including healthy) or formal sit down. We did a combination of the snack type (coffee, fantastic dessert) and make while you wait (out of the world flatbread-we got two different types) then sat at a tall table to eat. Here, unfortunately, not enough seats. And of course, people on their SmartPhones not even looking out the windows but taking up prime eating space where those that wanted to eat had to sit on the floor. If you're not eating, you shouldn't be allowed to sit at a table, especially on your phone. Were unhappy about that. We made sure to give our seats to people who were wanting to eat and didn't want to have to sit on the floor to do so. Afterwards we walked around and looked at the 360 amazing views. As expected, could hardly find an opening at the windows. At two locations there were presentations on a variety of topics related to NYC and the speakers were excellent. Eventually people cleared out as it got dark and we spent a long time speaking to Matthew (?) from Ohio who as I recall said he moved to NYC for theater and works there. We could only stump him on one question (Ellis Island, have the other buildings ever been open or just he main one). We asked all sorts of questions and he had answers. We really appreciated his time and never felt he wanted us to leave. I would highly recommend this. There is a gift shop too. iPads are available where you can point and push a button and get all sorts of details about the buildings you're seeing. We opted not to do that and probably should have. It wasn't that clear as rain was moving in but on a clear day, do it. As I recall, maybe $15. Well worth it."

The views are stunning and a must for the photographers amongst you. From the minute you enter its full of surprises (tip) have your video camera running when you enter the lift !!! There is a cafe and gift shop at the top so sit and have a coffee while the world carries on below you. Another tip the queues are enormous so if you can purchase vip tickets online before you go you walk straight past the queues and it's not much more expensive.(don't go into the queue ask a guide and they will show you where to go to bypass it )"

The elevator shoots you up to the top in 47 seconds! After getting off the elevator, you'll end up in a room where they start a video. I won't spoil it, but it's great. Then you move out into the observatory. Since this tower is so close to the water, one side of the observatory faces toward the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. We thought the view of New York from The Empire State Building was better, but this tower is gorgeous and it has a lot more flash and style than you get at the Empire State Building. I highly recommend you see both buildings!"

But it leaves a glare if you try to take a picture. Unlike the Empire State Building where you have an out door observatory. The food wasn't great and was obscenely priced even for New York standards...$6 for a bottle of Gatorade?The only thing that was unique was the ride to the top. It was literally 50 seconds to go up 1200 feet. And the elevator walls were giant LED screens that showed Manhattan being built up around you over the last 100 years. It was a cool novelty, but not worth the price of admission.In all, if they cut all the prices (admissions, food, gift shop, etc..) by 25% I would say this attraction was worth doing. But given the prices, you would be better off putting your money into something else (ESB or the Natural History Museum)."

The views are great, but the viewing areas are all inside and taking photos is a bit 'hit and miss' because of the reflections from the glass.

We got stuck in a 50 minute line trying to exit all at the same time. This can be a problem if you have another times site you are trying to make. The elevator rise is really short but fantastic, be sure to have your video ready to capture it. you will not have time to pull out your phone! eating options at top are very small and cannot accomodate a fraction of the people that arrive, so plan to avoid. Also, if you are lucky to get a seat in the dining room, the coke is $5.00 per glass -- they will be happy to refill, but they failed to tell us that the refill is $5.00 Rather deceptive not to tell folks this. We did not see the bill before our credit card was charged, so we had no idea until we look at the bill as we left. Note to management on the folks seating for the restaurant: we witness some pretty terrible behavior in this regard. Ignoring folks in line and telling some people they need reservations while telling others no reservations are taken and it is first come first served. There were at least 3 people at the desk on our day and we found what we observed very unprofessional. Indeed, I was first told I needed a reservation; then when I asked to make one the smae person told me that they do not take reservations and it was first some and first served and they expected a wait of an hour. I just kept coming back ( as there is not much to see after you walk around once or twice and take in the views) and when I spotted an opening at the bar I specifically asked for that and got it. So, we spent about 30 minuted getting up to the observatory and taking in the site -- 30 mins dining and about 45 minuted trying to get out. Limited toilets at the top so that is also a problem in exiting as folks are lining up for the toilet in the same area where you are trying to exit. Exiting procedures seem to be not well considered."

We did think that in event of low cloud there should be an alternate viewing area perhaps at say the 80th floor or if you do pre book you ticket and on arrival visibility is bad perhaps being given a credit to return when the weather is better.The staff were very courtious and helpful, but there is quite a bit of encouragement to purchase additional services in addition to the $32 entry fee."

At the end of this video, the screens suddenly roll up, and there it is - the view...but it is not 360 degrees. Neither is the view on 102 which is blocked by eateries and restrooms (water costs $5.50+ per bottle...see why I recommended you take a small throw away). Only when you get to 101 do you get unobstructed 360 degree views. Again, there is no 'outside' involved here...which could be a good thing if you don't feel comfortable about that sort of thing.

Once you enter the building, you take an escalator to the basement level and go through security there. We were able to move along pretty quickly, despite the long line. They took us up to the 102nd floor. There was a video that played on the elevator walls on the way up of New York City from time past to present. It took 48 seconds to go from the basement level to the 102nd floor. When you get to the top, the elevators open and you are led out to another room where you stand in line and await being able to continue further. Once leaving this room, you enter a final room before the observation deck where a short video is shown. And then\u2026the screen lifts up and you get an amazing view of the city. The screen then lowers back down and you are led into the observation deck. There are curtains blocking the view on the 102nd floor, but you are able to get a quick glimpse as long as you don\u2019t get caught staying too long. We then took the escalator/steps down to the 101st floor, which allows a view of the Hudson River side of the tower. The restaurant/bar keeps you from being able to get a 360 degree view of the city. Once you drop down to the 100th floor, you are then able to get a full 360 degree view of the city. There is also a gift shop on the 100th floor and restrooms."

The military veterans put their lives on the line to defend the very freedom we enjoy. They really need to re-visit the military \"discount\". Once inside, a water costs $5.49!!! That is a rip!!!!"

Of course, the views are outstanding but there is much more to the visit. It's best to reserve tickets on line for a prompt entry as visits are mostly on a timed entry basis. The smooth, swift elevators take you to the 102nd floor before you know it with interesting videos on the walls as you ascend. Then it a short film about the rise of New York City over the years with a surprise ending. Next you move down a level to the 101st floor where there is a caf\u00e9 and restaurant. We were there at 9:00 am and didn't sample the restaurant and bar as it doesn't open until 11:00am. Finally, you descend to the 100th floor where you have 360 degree views. There are guides to answer questions and also present interesting trivia about the City. We heard stories about the ubiquitous hot dog vendors (ask how much a license costs) and about the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Wait until you hear what goes on there! The only disappointment was the souvenir shop - Everything I checked was NOT USA made. We did not buy any souvenirs but did take lots of pictures. All in all an very enjoyable morning and a \"must do\" in New York City"

We were travelling from NJ on a Sunday so we had to time everything pretty well since the trains only run once an hour. First off, we should have left earlier, we left around 1pm and when we got there we had to buy our tickets which was not a good idea. The lines were so long and you just saw a crowd of people. To buy a ticket there you have to walk around the crowd and enter the building and there you will see where they are selling the tickets. We ended up getting tickets for entry 45 minutes later at 3:30PM because they were running late and the times were fully booked. My advise? Book ahead by purchasing online so you can arrive for your specific time and not have to wait around like we did. What made things worse is that it was blazing hot and there is nowhere to sit and rest your legs in the shade. There is sitting just in front of the entrance so if you can withstand the heat go right ahead. Our time finally came to start lining up and they have specific lines for the different times in 15 minute increments. So even though we lined up we still had to wait another half hour to get in since they were running late. So we are standing in line, in the hot sun. I felt like we were going to die. We didn't have any water and none was being sold in the direct area and the sun was beating down on us. I tried my best to shield my two small kids from the sun. Finally we moved into the building to form another line because now we had to go through a security check, with bag and body scanners like TSA at the airport. We then had to form another line to board the 5 elevators that would take us up to the observatory. By then my legs were numb from standing for so long, and my poor kids, such troopers, didn't complain. The elevator ride up and down was really cool because all three sides was like a screen showing you what the city looked like from decades back till now. So when you go in, make sure to face the back of the elevator. By then it was just after 4pm when we got off the elevator to then form another line to wait our turn for the short movie we would see. It wasn't a long wait, maybe 5 minutes, and then we were ushered into a small wide area that had huge screens against the wall. They played a show of the city and the people in it and at the end the screens scrolled up showing us a quick view of the actual city from where we were. AMAZING! At the end of the video we then made our way to the observatory at long last where we were free to use the bathrooms and take pics etc. The views were absolutely stunning and so worth the wait. A once in a lifetime opportunity cause I doubt I will pay that money and do that wait again. We were hoping to get some water at the restaurant but it was so ridiculously over priced at $5. Good thing we didn't waste our money because as soon as we left the elevators on our exit there was a water fountain. By then we were starving so we walked past the 9/11 memorial and there was a burger king and a pizza place just around the corner from there. Here is some advise: Like I said before, book ahead of time and make sure to go on a weekday during working hours to avoid the crowds."

The one minute elevator rides up, and later down, are spectacular for the \"movie\" shown, showing the history of the site and then zipping thru the building on the way down Try to go on a clear day, of course, when the views go on for miles. Even looking down/across to the immediate area is wonderful: Woolworth Building, Statue of Liberty, Governor's Island, and all downtown Manhattan. I did not try them, but there seem to be interactive tablets for rent---point the tablet out the window and it tells you what you're seeing. Great idea if you don't know where you are. Get timed entry tickets online (expensive: $32 full price), and lines and security will delay your entrance. But totally worth the wait and the cost. Definitely a must do."

Let me say that one more time\u2026avoid the weekends. We went there on a Saturday to check it out on the outside and the lines went on forever, and it was kind of rainy. Go inside during a weekday. We went on Tuesday and there was plenty of room at the windows to take lots of photos. 3. Have lunch on you. Yes, take a bottle of water and a sandwich and have a small picnic up there. We found a place to sit and just look outside. That's why I recommend to go during a week day. 4. Restaurant: We didn't go inside, but it looked nice. There is also a place to buy snacks. But I say take your own. 5. Bathrooms: They were super clean. 6. Souvenir shop: They are pricey but you only live once. A water bottle was 20 bucks. Magnet 6 dollars. 7. Start taking pictures and video even when you get inside the elevator on the way up. There is a cool video that gives you the timeline of the building of the structure. Awesome. 8. Everyone there is super friendly and willing to give you information of what you're looking at outside the window. This place is a must see whether you're with family or going alone\u2026worth the money. Happy travels!"

But with all of the technical achievements within this building, I was hoping that measures would be taken to make it more 'photography friendly'...If you don't care about taking photos add 2 points.

The problem with this was obvious, once of top, It was so incredibly crowded, you had to wait for people to move away from the window to get a good picture.

At the top, in addition to the spectacular views of New York harbor, Jersey City, midtown Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn with attendant bridges and ferries, there are two shows with live announcers and 'magic' special effects that tell you about different areas of NYC, current free attractions and events, and interesting bits of history and culture.

Up on top, One World has 3 floors of 360 views from floor to ceiling windows. The observation deck puts visitors eye to eye with helicopters and \"see-forever\" views like one of NYC's $99M penthouses. Mostly you look out on water, (the Hudson, the East River, the Statue of Liberty in the harbor and the ocean) but also landmarks - from City Hall, at the foot of building, to the George Washington Bridge. Unlike most of Manhattan, the observation deck offers plenty of open space to wander and the three levels allow visitors to press their noses to the glass without rubbing elbows. No one seemed to miss the binoculars mounted on the Empire State observation deck, but I wished for a pair to bird watch or for close-ups of roof top gardens. The food and bar makes for a great excuse to linger. This being NYC, expect lines, (the wait for the elevator down when leaving was as long as the wait to get in).

You see a brief movie and then see a spectacular view of Manhattan. There is a restaurant which also favors a great view. Then you travel a path down steps to enjoy a 360 degree view of the city. A professional pic costs $20. Then there is a line to take an elevator back down to the ground floor. The elevator was the smoothest I've ever been on, only feeling pressure by the ears."

Needless to say, fantastic views from the top. There are a couple of presenters on the viewing level, who use some nifty video technology to give an entertaining ten-minute presentation about NYC. If you're in town for a few days, our top tip is to buy the open ticket that gives you a choice of which day to go up. This lets you pick a fine day, because if the top is covered in cloud (as it sometimes is) you'll see nothing. Get the expedited-entry ticket, this whisks you straight to the front of the (long) lines. A few more dollars, but well worth it."

We booked our tickets the night before for the 9:15am arrival and turned up and only had to wait about 2 minutes before we could be let in.We paid for just regular tickets and then passes through security. After security you walk through a little history about how the new tower was constructed and the workers who made it.Then we quickly bored any elevator and were told to face the outside, the Elevator ride then begins and you see the history of new york city and it being built up, it was fairly fun for the 60 second ride to the top.Once at the top you head into a room with a bunch of people and wait in the dark for a minute and then watch a 2 minute video about new york city...at the end of the video the screens lift up and you are presented with a fantastic view of New York City. You are then free to wonder around and take in the views in your own time. We spent about 30 minutes looking at the views.We did not eat at the restaurant or buy any merchandise.Overall of a Major tourist attraction it was very well done, I find nothing worse than waiting in long lines when visiting tourist places and feeling like a sheep. This was not the case here, it was done well, and quickly and the staff had been trained well.A great new attraction in New York City for fantastic views"

Opened only one month, this place will be THE place to visit for NYC (and world) views.Claims to be the tallest building in the western hemisphere are easily believed when you get to the top.Unlike a previous reviewer, we simply walked in with a wait of probably 5 to 10 minutes Sunday morning. View was incredible and free guides at top were friendly and informative. As more people hear about this, I'd seriously recommend buying tickets online for a scheduled time: when we left the building a VERY long line had formed outside for walk-up hopefuls. An MSN article claims the Empire State building collected $111 million dollars in observatory fees last year. This is a competitive business and I'd bet the One World Observatory will at least be up in that arena. If you're sensitive to altitude changes, take your decongestants or antihistamines before you take the 60 second or so elevator up or down. It's pretty amazing how you barely feel the acceleration/deceleration at those speeds.Definitely recommend this trip, no need to rent the portable tablets at top, and brush off the usual photography operation at the top, which slows down your path to the actual viewing area."

We paid online for the tickets quite some time in advance.The normal admission is $30 bucks,but we paid $65 for the express any-time tickets (I can now hear new Yorkers shouting ,you paid whaa?).The top tickets turned out to be a good option. We had to choose a day of our choice to visit online ,but didn't have to choose a time(9:00am to 11:15pm) unlike the standard tickets. The extra $ means you can also jump the line .So upon arrival at 10am we found a guide tell a visitor that they were still only letting in 9:15 bookings, the line for visitors with tickets was already a good 100 deep which meant an approx.1hour wait. I showed her our printed out tickets and we just jumped the line and went straight through the revolving doors to the right hand security check point with no queue.The security here is the same level as an airport so belts off and everything out of your pockets and stand in the scanner .We then walk along a route along the ground level and watch a film presentation of construction guys and officials revealing some of the history of the building .Its now time to take the express lift to the 100th floor .As you ascend, the lift is wrapped in video and shows the history of NYC over the centuries as you ascend .In super fast time your up to the 100th floor. There is now another short 5 minute presentation on a screen.From here you are then free to wander around the 101st and 102nd floors with 360 views, with the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges being in close view. There is a small caf\u00e9, bar and usual gift shop as well as toilets and drinking water fonts. There are helpful staff around who were happy to help with any questions as well as presentation points with staff giving talks integrated with a unique circular tv display setup.The only downside is the glass glare makes it difficult to get quality photos, the Rockefeller is my top choice for pictures as its open air and has my favourite views from a skyscraper, however I feel this One world building is very well organised as well as the only south manhatttan skyscraper observatory and I found it to be a must see experience."

The elevators are very impressive - they are lined with computer screens that display New York city developing from a green grass island to the metropolis we see today all taking place before your eyes as you shoot up the 150+ floors in a matter of seconds. Once on the observatory level all the glass is frosted so you must get close to see the view. We could see out to the statue of liberty and up past empire state building and everything in-between. Its an amazing building and stunning view. A word of advice do the 9/11 museum first and this view will help pick you up after."

There is a video, employees who share the city with video technology and I saw some that had rented technology that would let you identify different buildings in their view by just pointing. If you are from out of town sounds like a wonderful addition to this experience. There of course is the glass observatory where you could take that Facebook/snap chat picture. I was really impressed with the friendliness of the staff everyone was helpful cheery and seemed very happy to be there. I was not at all disappointed with this experience. TIP there is fast pass entrance if your purchase you admission with a MasterCard. You get to go to the head of the line...sort of like Pre at the airport. So use the MasterCard, but pre buy your tickets so that you don't have to wait in the ticket line and waist valuable time."

Once you get in you get in another line for the elevators.The ride up is interesting in that they project views of NYC over the eons, to the present day. Once at the top, its another cattle call as they give you a hoakie presentation that I suppose they think is artistic. All I wanted to do was look outside, but you are locked into this presentation. Once finally out of there, you get forced into a picture taking line (for a price of course) . Finally, you get to look at the views out the window. Great views of NYC, NJ, Long Island. I have not been to the Empire State building for years, but that view platform was outside and the views were just as good (as I remember) and maybe the lines are shorter there. I'd try that first."

We were 1 of the first 3500 non Americans to visit the Freedom tower on 3/6.The experience starts down when you arrive walking to the One World Center. Most beautiful architecture I saw in complete NY. Really outstanding. Then the organization to enter was flawless. The walk to the elevators is a good start to be impressed and when the elevator takes you up the floor 101-102 in 45s with some animation of NY skyline history you remark that all has been worked out in detail. There are no dramatic scenes or remembering, that is OK, we don't have to be remembered, WE KNOW and don't forget. The view from about 520m hight is fantastic. We have been 1 hour just enjoying that 360 view. I would say : A must in NY, a visit to ground zero, One World Center and the Freedom Tower ( One World Trade Center Observatory )."

On a positive, it has to be said that the staff were all excellent and helpful, and changing our tickets was a pain-free experience. Your visit begins with the obligatory airport-style security checks, and then up in the elevator to the 102nd floor, where you enjoy a very impactful short video presentation. Once in the observatory itself though is where the real issue arose, which is the reflection in the glass that surrounds your view. The views are excellent, however taking reflection-free photos is near impossible, and this made it a real let-down for me.For me, the Top of the Rock was the better observation deck, because you can be exposed to the open air and have narrow slits between the glass panes with just about accommodate a camera lens for glare-free photography.If you're not too bothered about the photography aspects, then you do get great views of the Statue or Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the other iconic sights of lower Manhattan"

            "review": "The View was the Star of the Show!. First and foremost, I will say that I was there on June 26, 2015, when the initial viewing time was still cloudy. The view wasn't so bad, so even if the forecast calls for an overcast sky, be a daredevil and get to the top of the world.When I took the cab from Residence Inn WTC hotel to the West Entrance to the World Trade Center, I was a bit worried dye to the cloudy skies above us. Plus, we had our 93-year old grandmother with us who is afraid of heights but we couldn't leave her in the hotel. As we entered the lobby of the WTC from the Observatory Plaza across World Financial Center, and descended via the elevators, we got special access to the priority VIP venues because of our grandma. We passed through specialized security checks as well. The ascent to the 102nd floor in the Skypod elevator was incredible as we saw the New York skyline change from the 1500s to the present in addition to a quick glimpse of the Twin Towers, and the building of One WTC around you. When you got to the 102nd floor, you would enter the theater venues that (like the elevator) was dizzying, it was all worth it and the experience was magnificent.But let's face it, you are here for the spectacular view of New York, New Jersey and all the way to Pennsylvania. So everyone clapped and cheered for the rising of the theater screen for the reveal of the breathtaking views. Then, since we had a senior with us, we had access to the elevator across the Skypods. We then went to the 100th floor main viewing galleries, where you could take in the spectacular views in 360 degrees. Some people would complain due to lack of seating, but you can sit on the vents lining the windows on the 100th floor or on the 101st floor dining piazzas. I will say that the addition of the Sky Portal was cheesy and clearly fake. It was said to scare even adults, but even 4-year old children were on it and didn't get an ounce scared. We paid for the One World Explorer, that might be more costly, but gives you a quick yet thorough overview of the Big Apple, while looking down at the curvature of the Earth. That's when the sky started to clear up.City Pulse was also a great experience and we would constantly wait for a new concierge man to start another session of it. We then headed to the 101st floor dining level, and the formal restaurant was a dinner place, so we ate at the semiformal One Mix, with four-star food. The view from there was also splendid. The sky was brilliant. If you want to keep memories of NYC and the WTC on top of the world, pay extra for the tickets for pictures behind the green screen on the 101st floor. You can pay for as many as you want and take as many as you want. They will give you two versions of the same picture-the Lower Manhattan skyline at noon, and the Lower Manhattan skyline at dusk.If you love souvenirs, you are going to love the gift shop on the 100th floor. It has everything, from paintings to water bottles, from wine glasses to sunglasses, from shirts and caps to cards and envelopes, all inscribed with the signature logo of One World Observatory.We headed down at around 1:30 pm, and while the red-lit elevator lobby was elaborate, the descent via the Skypod was even more dazzling, as it circled around the WTC 1 tower and re entered it via windows, also giving a glimpse of the completed/future WTC site. Overall, the experience at One World Observatory was amazing, exceptional and unlike any other, and we are definitely coming back. It was so sad to leave NYC. :'(P.S.: This is just my own personal experience and don't complain if you end up having a substantially worse one."

One advantage in having a son and his family in New York City is how often we get to visit.Combine that with move junkets over the years and just being old, you do get opinions.This one is about which top of New York building is number one.The Empire State building is historic and offers a nice view downtown and uptown. Top of The Rock is a modern space with even better views to the north.But if you could only do one, I would recommend the observatory at Freedom Tower.We went a few days after it opened this summer. The cost is a whopping $32, with a couple buck break in you old.They sell advance ticket time slots and I can\u2019t recommend strongly enough that you go that route instead of standing in line to buy tickets.We weren\u2019t sure exactly what time we would arrive so we didn\u2019t buy our time slot until we got there. They offer one every 15 minutes. While we walked right in, people were lined up for long periods in the sun waiting to just buy the tickets we bought with a few keystrokes at the same price.You see some visuals about the building of the freedom tower and you can touch original footings from the World Trade Center. Then it is on the elevator for an incredibly fast and visually interesting trip up.I won\u2019t give you details to spoil the effect but when you come off the elevator there is another short visual before you are cut loose on the tower. It is a dramatic moment.As for the view, it is impressive. The Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governors Island, lower Brooklyn, Verrazano Bridge, all look close with the ocean in the distance.Move and you have New Jersey and lower Manhattan at your feet. Then midtown, then Wall Street and the Brooklyn Bridge. And our day was partly cloudy. Imagine a totally clear day. (Another reason not to buy tickets to far in advance, a bad overcast day would make it a waste. I just hope they don\u2019t start selling out time slots in advance)It is a comfortable walk around the observation deck even with the crowds. We found a bar and seats and enjoyed a drink and a cheese plate at New York prices (but not crazy prices) while we took in the scene.One nutty thing is that to enjoy the fancy restaurant or bar and cafe up top, you have to pay the $33 to get there. That is goofy and will have to change.After our food and drink, we took another swing around the top to let the views sink in.I think it earned the price. They are pushing it, but the Freedom Tower Observatory is special.A couple of side notes:I worried that it would be a bit of a downer, taking the place of the World Trade Center.I visited the observation deck on top the World Trade Center several times. It\u2019s open air experience was very different. And I was sickened like everyone else on 9/11.It turned out the Freedom Tower has more of a sense of awe and looking forward than one of sadness and looking back. Not that we forget.Finally, while I rate Freedom Tower tops, the bar at the Top of the Rock is special, with great views. It is worth the $25 drink to take it all in."

BUT, we had one day in NYC, the tickets were bought ahead of time and were non-refundable and we didn't have an option to return at a later date........so, we didn't anticipate much. That's good.The elevator ride up was amazing!! I think we were in there 30 seconds and flew up to the top. I knew to look at the sides of the elevator to watch the development of NYC, but I just wanted to savor the experience, not just whisk through it. Once we got to the top, it was like entering a Jamaican flea market. Employees in blue t-shirts were selling their souls, their wares to the point of being annoying. IF we just paid a LOT of money to see nothing, why weren't the ipad viewing things for rent FREE??? The brash commercialism of this place was annoying and of course the view a total blanket of grey. The best part of this trip was going up and going down. Invite me back when you remove all the HAWKERS!!!"

One annoying thing was it was too light and when you tried to take a picture of the view there was a reflection. Amazing design and alot of thought has been put in to making this.

Very crowded and I felt that we were just a herd of cattle being directed to either pose for the picture that they try to get you to buy or to pay extra for the 'special' observatory tour. There wasn't much learning experience along the way. Nothing interesting to read about or see on display. Just the 360 degree view which after awhile, was boring.

Be aware that there are no signs as to what queue is for what (unlike the 9/11 museum who seemed a lot more organised.) We queued as early as they would allow us, at 11:45 for a 12pm ticket. From the queue we were ushered in at 12:10pm. From entering we reached the elevators at 12:25pm after security, which was fast, and having to walk around a \"cave\"..... The lift only took a minute or so but once at the top it took us another 15 minutes before we actually got into the observatory area, including having to watch a video and more queuing. So, for a 12pm ticket we did not reach where we paid to go until 12:40pm, almost 1 hour after we were advised to queue. What annoyed me was that people who had arrived late for their ticketed times, 11:30 and 11:45, were able to join another queue and enter before us, even though their entry times had passed. This queue was then allowed in before ours was, even though everyone in our line had made the effort to arrive before time and not to be late.The only thing worth the money paid is the views. The lift ride video up is pretty cool but what should be expected for a $32 ticket. Make sure you go on a clear day to get a good view. Be prepared to have to walk through One World employees trying to sell you the $15 Ipad experience, which is totally unnecessary. We had purchased 1.30pm tickets to the Memorial Museum next door thinking that 1.5hrs would allow us plenty of time for the Observatory and a quick lunch in between as well. However with all the queuing we only had about 20mins to look at the view (in crowds of people all trying to get window space as well). We felt rushed as we were running out of time and had to join yet another queue to get back down the elevator again. So overall felt a bit ripped. And we had no spare time once we got back outside. If you are doing both the museum and observatory on one day and are going to buy timed tickets then make sure you give yourself PLENTY of time. Overall an average experience."

There was minimal queuing for the elevators, which are extremely fast and have been fitted with HD screens showing the incredible rise of Manhattan over the centuries, from empty land to the skyscrapers we see today.Once at the 102 floor you are then ushered into a long thin room to watch the 'See Forever' montage of New York City life. This is cool, but hard to see properly as it is very long and the room is thin so you cannot take it all in. Regardless, the icing on the cake, and something that I will not reveal so as not to ruin the surprise, comes at the end of the montage, and truly took my breath away. There were gasps from the crowd followed by a huge round of applause. And that's all I have to say about that.After the montage you are then free to enter the main observatory. And, once again, it is breathtaking. We were lucky with the weather and had a cloudless blue sky. Of course, everyone wants to look out of thew windows so at times it was hard to find a spot, but you cannot complain. There are two levels, with the upper floor housing the ridiculously expensive cafe ($5 for a small bottle of water), and the lower floor housing the main observation area. There is a fake glass floor showing an 'aerial view' of the street below but this was empty and no-one seemed interested. It was a little tacky to be honest, especially compared to the real thing in Toronto's CN Tower. Having said that, the views from the windows are incredible and well worth the ticket price.In total, from entering, security, and time at the top, we spent an hour there, but as I mentioned, we had priority tickets. I'd say definitely pre-books your tickets and if you can afford it, get priority ones."

            "review": "100% inadequate management ruins our dream. Day 7 - Final Day in New York and what a great way to finish - a trip up One World Observatory....or so we thought. Let me set the scene.Both Liz and I had been to the top of the Twin Towers back in the 1980s and when we heard that One World Observatory was due to be opening in 2015, we really hoped that its opening would coincide with our holiday during the last week in May to New York. So with that in mind I registered with the One World Observatory website and waited to hear when it was opening.So when it was announced that the inaugural opening was on Friday 29 May 2015, which happened to be on our last day in New York, we were over the moon.I received the e-mail to say when tickets were going on sale and allowing for the time difference it meant that I would need to leave a Board meeting early to ensure that I was online at 3pm UK time. I duly made my excuses and left the meeting and logged in on time, actually about 5 seconds after 3pm UK time (10am NY time when the tickets first went on sale) and was hugely disappointed when I got through as there were no time slots left for Friday 29 May and as we were flying back to the UK that day I thought that was our chance gone. Big shame as it would have been great to have gone up on opening day.Later that day, Wednesday 8 April as I left work and was sitting on the train home, my iPhone alert announced an e-mail had come through and I saw that it was from One World Observatory offering tickets. A bit masochistically I opened the e-mail expecting to see time slots available for 30 May which would have been after we had arrived back in London; to my amazement there were Priority Access tickets available for a 2.45pm time slot on Friday 29 May. I literally had less than a minute to book the tickets on my iPhone before I knew I would be losing any reception on my iPhone. I managed to get two tickets for the 2.45pm time slot literally a couple of seconds before my phone lost the signal. I was ecstatic with excitement and couldn't wait to get home to tell Liz.We arrived in New York on Friday 22 May and had a fantastic week and on Friday 29 May we finished our lunch in Les Halles Downtown on John Street and paid the bill at 1.03pm and made our way towards Vesy St and One World Observatory. we arrived at 1.15pm and joined the back of the queue which was alongside One World Trade Center on Vesy St. We knew we were one and half hours early for our 2.45pm Priority Access time slot (N.B. The ticket reads \"...On a tight schedule? Priority Admission allows guests who have pre-selected a specific date and time to enjoy VIP expedited entry, bypassing the general admission line...\") but joined the back of queue and waited for a One World Observatory member of staff to come along so we could check where we needed to go with our 'avoid the general admission line' tickets. After about 15 minutes a member of staff came by and when I asked they said that we still had to stay in this queue and wait for our time slot to be called.It was an exceedingly hot day as we stood waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting....there was no shade, no water vendors nearby and no communication from One World Observatory staff. By 2.15pm, half an hour before our time slot a member of staff came past calling out for anyone with 1pm time slots...yes 1pm time slots. Again I asked the member of staff where we needed to be for our Priority Access 2.45pm time slot and was told to stay where we were and await to be called.I did a quick calculation that if we were running one and a quarter hours late we would have about 10 minutes up at the top before we needed to come back down and get our transport to JFK for our flight back to London.At 3pm another member of staff came past calling out for any one with 1.30pm time slots, again I repeated my question, reinforcing the point that we had Priority Access tickets and this time saying that we needed to be at JFK to check in for our flight by 4.45pm and it was going to take at least an hour to get to the airport. Again I was told to wait until our time slot was called. I hate to admit it, but we did what everyone else appeared to be doing and 'jumped our time slot' and proceeded along Vesy St to the front of One World Trade Center only to be confronted with another enormous queue.By 3.30pm we had moved forwards about 15 feet in the queue and looking at the size of the queue still ahead of us, I left the queue in search of a Supervisor and eventually found one, showed her our Priority Access tickets for a 2.45pm time slot, only to be told that they were running about one and half hours behind and we would have to wait. I said that we were flying back to London and needed to be at JFK in one and quarter hours time and with it being Friday it was more than likely going to take that long to get there (it actually took one and a half hours); and her response was to simply shrug her shoulders and walk off.So despite having already queued for two and quarter hours, as the queue ahead of us was still likely to take at least another hour + just to get to the front door, we hd no choice but had to leave so that we would get to JFK on time.We were obviously bitterly disappointed as we had really been looking forward to ending our holiday 'on a high', but it wasn't to be thanks to the diabolical organisation, or lack of it by One World Observatory staff. Added to which that was $104 worth of tickets wasted.Thankfully we had been up both the Empire State and Top of the Rock so we already had some great memories and pictures."

Visited it yesterday.best tip is to be there as early as possible.we booked 10 am and the queues where already getting big.and it was a bit of wait at some of the windows as there was so many people at the windows.the lift was'nt what I thought it was going to be like it shown on u tube.it was false trying to make you think you was really going to see the streets through the glass.dissapointed so many people are allowed in at the same time."

I have been blessed to see views from observatories around the world and this one is the best. We were fortunate enough to just make sunset on a beautiful evening which only made the view more spectacular. We had an 8 o'clock ticket and got to the top at 8:31. Although it was very very crowded with some folks camped out in the window seats taking selfies we are glad we went when we did. We were in the area at 6 pm and there was no crowd but still kept the 8 time. Don't miss this."

We booked tickets online in advance and the organisation of entry for ticket holders is very efficient.The Global Welcome centre is very impressive and gives information on visitor numbers etc to date. The Sky Pod elevator is a fantastic experience, taking you through the history of New York City as you ascend rapidly to the observation area. Before going to the observation deck there is a walk through theatre with a three dimensional screen which shows a spectacular movie about NYC and ends very dramatically. Disappointingly , however, the space is too small for the number of visitors and if you are not at the front the experience is somewhat diminished. Why not have a sloping floor so those at the back could have a better view.There are 2 levels of observation deck with wonderful views of the city. We were there at sunset and also watched the city become illuminated, which was beautiful.We were very disappointed with the dining facilities. There was a severe shortage of chairs in the cafe area and a limited range of food. Also the prices matched the height of the building, sky high!!! Exorbitant!! 8 dollars for a chocolate croissant. And that is just one example. Why try to rip people off in this manner? The visit was worth it for the views and also was moving in light of all the lives lost there on 9/11. So I would recommend it but wait until you are back at ground level for your refreshments!"

I walked past the One World a couple of times while we were in the neighborhood and finally decided to get a ticket on a clear day. I'm glad I went early. We ended up getting through the line in reasonable time. They have a dramatic elevator ride and entrance. They clearly want to outdo the Empire State Building tour and they easily do. You can walk around once at the top as long as you like. I saw some low flying planes and joked to my wife that I always get uncomfortable when I am in a WTC bldg. and I see airplanes flying close by :-) It's an awesome view in all directions. People from all over the world there to check it out. My wife sat down to a meal while gazing out. Most of the tourists probably also take in the 9-11 Memorial museum across the street as we did the night before. I would highly recommend to anyone. Enjoy"

We have been to empire state, statue of liberty, etc, but this location is extremely unorganized and it kind of ruined the experience.We had tickets for a Saturday evening, but it was cloudy. We walked right into the tower with no que. That day, the staff was friendly and helpful. They knew what to do. We exchanged our tickets for the next day at noon for a better view.The website indicates that you should arrive 15 minutes in advance of your entry time. We arrived 20 minutes early. When we arrived, there were no signs. One door had a long line, the other door was propped open, with no sign. We thought the line was for people buying tickets and that the other door was for pre purchase. The night before, we had walked right in, so we thought the entry line was inside. Immediately, a staff member started yelling art us and all of the others entering that door. \"This door is exit only!\" We walked out and tried to figure out what to do. There were no signs or staff on the right side except for the yelling staff member, but he didn't tell us what to do instead. We walked to the left, where there were more confused staff members. We told them ticket time 12:00. It was 11:30. They told us to go away and come back in 15 minutes. When we got back, the 3 staff members were all asking each other which line was which, which was loading. Was the 12:30 line loading? None of them knew.Finally, were allowed into line, waited a while and then allowed in.Once inside, we moved quickly to the ticket taker. She was pleasant and efficient. Security line and staff were fine. Then, you move into this line/movie experience. We were moving along fine. Next you get to a cave. The line was moving along OK, but then a staff member shouted out, \"this is not a line! Everyone move into all sections, left and right! All of a sudden, the area was smashed with people and barely moving. It was dark and crammed. I don't know what you would do if you needed to get out of there. No staff were in the winding part of the cave. There were no apparent exits or bathrooms. Anyone with claustrophobia should not go in there. Finally we were at the elevators. Staff there were fine.The elevator experience was amazing!! The show at the top was also awesome.When you enter the observatory, you are in a cafeteria, with an elevator down to the viewing area on the right. It was kind of odd. The view was amazing! It was just tainted by all of the stress of the queing and staff issues. We pre ordered tickets, thinking we could avoid these issues.We ate a snack at the dining area. After, we couldn't locate the trash, so we asked a cafeteria worker, who also said she couldn't find the trash can! What? Bizarre.Anyhow, I am mainly writing this review so that hopefully, the management of the property can properly train the staff and so that the outside line area can be reconfigured. I also suggest an exit area in the cave section. I know this observatory is new, but peak season is coming soon, so they should probably re train and reorganize. Make signs!"

Last night I had booked two tickets for this newest attraction in the big apple to go up right before sunset. And it was very disappointing. I have been on top of the old WTC and the only thing that really got better was that there was nearly no waiting time at the bottom. If you buy your tickets (32 $ for the cheapest version) online, you can book it for an exact time (15 minutes steps) which I did. that worked out really well. The rest was by far not as good as expected, because it is more important for the owner to get additional money out of your pocket than enjoy the view. Including a nice \"time travel presentation\" in the elevator you climb the 102 levels within a minute. Once arrived in floor 102 they give you a little presentation before opening the screen to give you a first real view of Manhattan. But then you have to walk through information, where they try to sell you a \"wallpaper\"-background-pic with yourself, you have to pass a restaurant/cafe and climb down to floor 100 to finally see the 360 \u2022 panorama. When we were there it was extremely crowded (sunset/lightening of the city). They have too big monitors positioned in a circle in my opinion which are located in that area and they also could not resist to put their shop on that same level (!!) (why not when leaving the building downstairs?)Also there are obviously no rules there. People sat right next to the glass and sat there forever with all their bags surrounding them. Besides that I think this is a security issue it was also annoying if you want to take pics. The darker it gets, the more reflection you have in the windows and that means you have to bring your camera very close to the window. But you can't because so many people sort of \"picnic\" there. Very disappointing for me was that though they do have some kind of a big bulls-eye with glass you do not get what you would expect from such a modern building: to have a real view to the ground!! unlike in many other cities they only play a video!! Of course the view of Manhattan is still worth the trip (but don't pay more than the standard prize which is expensive enough). And at least I didn't have to wait over two hours this time compared to the old WTC. By the way: you can't approach the memorial fountain at the bottom after 9 p.m. real close for security reasons."

Eventually we found the ticket office and we had to queue for 30 minutes outside in the sun for our ticket. Then we were told to come back at 2:15. When we came back at that time we had to queue again and it was down the steps onto the sidewalk. A disaster. People were so mad. 40 minutes later the queue started to move. It takes a further 30mins of queuing to get through the security checks and finally up the the top. To be honest. The view is nice, but the view from The Rockafellar is much better. The Rockafellar has indoor and outdoor viewing areas. One World is super busy so it's not relaxing whatsoever. People pushing to the window to get photos. One World seems too enclosed and loud. So my advice is to skip One World Observatory altogether unless you want a day of waiting, queuing, frustration and disappointment. Go to the Top of the Rock. You won't be disappointed there."

To begin, unless you pay a ridiculous amount for an untimed ticket, you will have a timed ticket that comes in 15 minute increments. We were a little early for ours so we had to wait on the sidewalk by the stairs up to the building. This was early in the morning on a gloomy day; if it was busier it would have caused a big random crowd. The line that you stand in once it is your time is completely outside...this will be a nightmare on rainy days, humid days, and cold/snowy days. It was drizzling a little bit while we stood in line but luckily it was right before we were let in. I don't think there is anything they can do to fix this since everything is built but I can't believe they didn't take this into account. I know the lines are notoriously long at Empire State Building (it wasn't for us at 6:30pm on a Thursday) but at least the whole line is inside the building. The quick elevator ride up was cool-it shows the progression of NYC over the past few hundred years. The floor above the discovery floor is small and I saw a lot of confused people thinking it was the main observation floor. The main observation floor gets packed so it feels small too. Even though tickets are timed, that is just for entrance and security purposes; anyone can stay on top for as long as they would like which makes things very crowded. Since the building is in lower Manhattan, it is hard to tell what all the Midtown buildings are. There were at least 2 stations set up where a worker was explaining some buildings, which helped. Or you can pay extra to rent an iPad that has some sort of information on it (I didn't pay much attention to this, as we had already paid enough for the tickets alone). We stayed up top for a while but only because I was \"trying to get my money's worth.\" The last thing we did before going down was get a bite to eat. I was shocked that a normal sized water bottle and small apple juice were $5 EACH. This is the only place our whole time in NYC that had such exorbitant prices. Overall, I think OWO is a waste. We didn't do Top of the Rock but that may have been a better choice to add to Empire, which we did do. However, OWO has a lot of significance so I know that most will want to go regardless of this review. If you must go, pick a day with mild and sunny temperatures and also do at least one other skyscraper because there is no WOW factor here. (The 9/11 Memorial is amazing though, but not considered a part of this)."

Unfortunately too few staff too ill equipped to deal with it, although after 1 hour of queuing we did get in, you take a lift up, too much CGI stuff going on in my opinion, bypass the people with ipads and look out the windows for the best views in NYC."

The lift takes 69 seconds to get to the top and shows an interactive video of New York being built. You get to learn loads about the sense of community after 9/11 happened and is really interesting. When you get to the top you're shown a quick presentation and then the amazing view is revealed. The only thing that was annoying was the queue. to get out and back down I wouldn't recommend it if you're claustrophobic. The views are breathtaking though, we went just as the sun was setting and you're allowed to stay at the top for as long as you want. If i did it again if go early and go to ground zero and the museum in the daytime and then visit the observatory around 8 as the sun goes down."

We decided to grab a bite to eat so we could relax and enjoy the view. After purchasing our food we went to sit down and realized that over 1/2 the tables didn't even have chairs. Our 3 kids were exhausted and had to stand to eat. For the price people are paying to get in and then to eat they could at least BUY SOME CHAIRS and maybe add an activity or two for younger kids!"

This is a higher price than the timed admissions, but allowed us flexibility to attend when it was convenient for us (we waited til later in the day to allow some of the cloud cover to burn off). The Day Flex admission allowed us to skip all lines. It was crazy that we literally walked up and were told to step in front of all the people queued up outside waiting to get inside. Once inside, there was a line for airport-style security and we were by-passed to a separate queue that had no wait. After the security point, we had a choice to queue up with the regular ticketed folks (which apparently walks through some artifacts or something as you wait?) or walk directly onto an elevator...again, we chose to skip directly to the elevator. While others probably waited quite some time to get in, our Flex passes allowed us to virtually go straight up. The elevator ride is somewhat crowded which takes away from your ability to see the 'elevator show,' but it happens so quickly that it didn't bother us. The 'show' when you get out of the elevator was spectacular and I won't spoil it for those who have yet to attend. The views were amazing and, although it was crowded, we had no problem getting a view of everything we wanted to see. Others here have commented that people \"hog\" the windows or sit and block the views, but I can say that, during our visit (about 2pm on a Friday afternoon), it wasn't much of a problem and people were generally courteous about moving so others could take pictures. All in all, I would do it again and would suggest it to my friends/family."

Convenient to book tickets online (we chose tickets for a fixed day with all day flexible entrance hour. Afternoon was a bit rainy and cloudy, ie less good view from the tower, so we could wait until the weather was clear and then go straight to the top). By doing so, we also got to see the Manhattan view in both daylight and after dark (with all lights). Enter the premise from Vesey street and the building from West street side. After passing security elevators take you to the 102nd floor in less than 60sec. Amazing video show on three walls inside the elevator during ride. This could have been further explored in the exhibition area or in the iPads available for rent, as this was maybe the most interesting part except for the view itself. We had added pay for iPads in advance (not really knowing what to expect), but these were a bit of disappointment. In short they were an interactive satellite map of what you could see from the tower with some points marked out specifically, ie you would point at f.i. Empire state building and the iPad would zoom into that building and show a 30 sec video about that building. If you have not been to N.Y. before, probably this could be of some use, but you could just as well do with a good travel guide book/map. As there were no headsets to the iPad (not possible to plug in external ones either) and the noise level is quite high, you would either watch the movie without hearing what they say, or put it near your ear to listen to the story told without seeing the movie played. Hopefully they will develop the software over time and add more content, for instance including the video shown in the elevator, to bring more value for the money. Otherwise the iPads will be hanging around your neck instead of being used, as happened to us already after a few minutes. If you are a family or a group, you can definitely share one iPad per several persons. The view from observatory deck is spectacular (as is the one from Empire state building, but here you get a better view over Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn bridge).We had planned to eat from the \"One Mix\" menue while enjoying the view (\"One Dinner\" is the full restaurant menue and you can reserve table in advance, \"One Mix\" has a bit smaller or simpler dishes but does not allow pre-reservation and \"One cafe\" is what it says - sandwiches, wraps and pastry). However, it turned out that One Mix menue is not available after 3 or 4 pm (!), so we decided to go for some sandwiches/wraps in the cafe instead. Any alcohol had to be bought separately from the bar in the restaurant (separate queuing). Prices for food and drinks are naturally much expensive as in all tourist attractions like this. The souvenir shop had a quite well developed assortment."

On balance it was a good experience. The star of the show is the view of course. The whole of Manhattan - and beyond - lies open at your feet. Unfortunately, the main attraction has been surrounded by cod theatricals involving projections of New York 'through the ages' as the lift carries you in short order to the 102nd floor. I found this cheapened the experience and gave it an unnecessary flavour of theme park. However, once installed in the observatory area itself, the floor-to-ceiling glazing ensures that the views take centre-stage and not even the appallingly kitsch retail souvenir offerings could detract from that. There are presentations made at various vantage points on the deck. I missed out on these but my son told me that they were entertaining and informative. The service agents were, to a man, enthusiastic and geed up by their ambassadorial roles. They did a good job.I think I was just a little surprised not to see any reference at all to the twin towers that had occupied this airspace previously. Of course I realise that there is a monument and a museum dedicated to the memory of those who died, and that these are no more than a step away. However, it seems strange that it is possible to enjoy a visit to these outstanding panoramas without being reminded of that appalling day we all share. Perhaps I missed it, but I would have liked to have seen at least a quiet corner of the attraction dedicated to that memory."

We got up early enough to see the endless vista and a stunning red sunset. Inside, at 1,200 ft (approx height of observatory levels), OWO is a cesspool. The promoters have made every effort to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Examples of the many awful aspects/features of the joint:Hawkers giving a blasting presentation on the north and south corners of the building that was as insipid as it was loud. The only place to sit is on the 8\" high radiators that surround the perimeter. People sitting on this uncomfortable spot block views and prevent people from taking pictures. The building itself is not built in line with the Manhattan street grid so efforts to look in many directions are obstructed by the slanted mullions between the glass. I could go on but, other than the sunset, I'd rather forget the experience. My family greatly enjoys the Empire State Building, we treasure visits to the RCA/NBC/Comcast observatory, we loved stepping out on the top of the old WTC observatory, but nothing will drag us back to the pit that is OWO. I should add, there are two good features (other than the view): the elevator ride up features a surround film of the construction of NY over time. I'll look forward to seeing that at a pace where it can be inhaled as opposed to the impossibly fast pace in the elevators. Also, at these insane prices, there was virtually no line!"

I didn't have to wait in line which on the day I went must have saved me about 90 minutes. The views of the city were spectacular but I do agree that you need to try to wrangle window space. I liked that there were staff posted to explain where to go as well as someone who gave you the culture and history of NYC and the neighborhoods.I will definitely return with family at a later date and to see the 9/11 Museum which I didn't have time to see."

Luckily for the time slot we booked, we were told there would be no visibility as it was raining and we were able to rebook.BUT: The ride up in the elevator where you are supposed to see the development of NY is 'a have' as they crowd so many into the lift you cannot see what is happening on the three screens. Next you are herded into a narrow space to see another AV but again the screen is too wide and you are too close to see what is going on.Then the screens are raised so you can see the city but you are hustled off again after about 30 seconds. There is no interpretation unless you pay another $15 for an Ipad to explain what you are seeing. Nothing to explain about the tower or what you are looking at. Pretty rubbish when you are paying $32.The grills and glass don't make for great photos and the food area is the most unbelievable disorganised mess. You select or order you food and then have to go elsewhere to pay for it. I waited for my pizza slice then had to queue with my hot food to pay. The cashier was stressed out and totally pissed off and unfriendly. I was tempted not to bother paying and I'm sure many people just walked off with their food and didn't pay; would have been easy to do. Getting a drink from the bar meant a separate queue.We didn't bother. There was one chair for every 1-2 tables and no-one cleaned them off.The best part about the whole experience is a lovely man at the entrance on the ground level called David who welcomes visitors.

Before i thought that Rock is the best choice, coz it offers both Central Park and E.State panorama. At the end i decided to have One Wolrd Observatory Tour to get the newest one. Sure the NYC panorama looks fascinating from all asaid buildings but the ambiance of corridors, information screens, special elevator, the theater etc. upgrades your experience..Since long time nothing charmed me like this place.. By the way, buy the ticket from web to gain time.."

The experience in the lift, the teaser presentation on the big screen and then the views! It was absolutely amazing and was probably helped by the clear, sunny weather.I felt this was better than the Empire State Building because you can see the tower from the outside which gives you more of a connection with it.One slight negative is the restaurant. It is a bit of a shambles with poor overpriced food, not very good service and too few seats. But please don't let this put you off, if you only do a few things in New York, make sure this is one of them."

We were among the last visitors to the top of the old World Trade Center towers and among the first to the One World Trade Center Observatory, and the new tower offers an even more memorable experience, if such a thing is even possible! Wait til you get on the elevators and see the surprise that is in store for you (no, I won't ruin it by giving any more clues)! All I can say is, whoever designed the new observatory really put a lot of creative thought into it. Oh, and it's MUCH easier to get to the top than it is with the Empire State building, and it costs less too! This has to be one of the most fantastic/engaging attractions now available in the city that never sleeps."

Like many others I was blown away with the first views of the city - as articulate as I can be there's few words I have which can come close to doing that instantaneous reaction justice.The views across New York are incredible, from a view standpoint it's incredible, but with the windows & the reflections if like me you're a \"point & click\" kinda photographer don't get your hopes up! I went up at night specifically to see the city at night having done ESB during the day and I can't say I was disappointed with that decision, the city lights just add to the view of New York.Can't say security was a problem, nothing you wouldn't expect although I'd imagine during peak hours this would be time consuming if you're lucky you can get through in minutes.Overall I'd recommend it if for nothing else than that first view of New York from the observatory, you'll know what we all mean when you see it yourself."

The ride to the top is documented by a little picture of the building that shows how high the elevator is climbing with a graphic illustration. Once you leave the elevator there is a short movie before you are ushered to the stirs for the observatory deck. The view can be spectacular if you have a sunny day.

We chose One World over the other observatories mainly because it was newly opened. We chose a 8:15 time to hit the 8:30 sunset. We arrived at 7:40pm and were allowed to start lining up around 7:50 for the 8:15. At around 8 they started letting us in the building. You have to go through airport style security so that takes a while. Then you walk through a set of exhibits with various bits of info about the building. Then you line up for the elevators. Once at the top, you wait in line again to enter a theater where you have to wait to watch a presentation with a reveal at the end. Then you are let into another room, but wait! You still aren't there yet! There are some small windows in the corner of the first level that everyone squishes up to slowing everyone else down. You have to go down 2 levels to finally get to the 360 degree views. Point being, it's gonna take a loong time to get up there, so plan accordingly if you are trying to time sunset. for night viewing, the observation deck is terrible for reflections. There are tons of bright lights inside making reflection-free photos pretty impossible without bringing a black cloth of your own. Luckily my mom was wearing a black cardigan that we used as a reflection blocker to get good shots. There is no outdoor area. The restaurant closes at 4 and the cafe was out of most everything at 8PM. So they haven't quite figured out the food thing yet. Overall it's good if you don't care that much about taking pictures and you enjoy a very controlled scripted experience."

I made it into the building at 2:20 with tickets for 2 o'clock. After airport style security screening and a walk through the bedrock another que was formed to wait for an elevator. A very quick ride with an interesting time view on the way up to the 102 floor brings you out on a balcony and a short boring video presentation that ends in a dramatic way with the screen being raised to present a spectacular view of the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge. As you work your way down to the 100th floor you get a 360 degree view through some very crowded windows. It is tough to get good photos without reflections. If you want good photos, the outdoor observation platforms at the Top Of The Rock and The Empire State Building will provide better images. For me, this was a disappointment after visiting the outdoor deck of the south tower of the WTC in the summer of 2001. My only advice is to not wait until the day of your visit to buy tickets. The line is very long and it will detract from your visit. The views are great, if they could only be outside, they would be perfect."

I also paid the up-charge for the expedited entry - well worth it. The on site ticket counter is inside the building and has limited space, so the lines snaked around the block.There didn't seem to be a system for the expedited entry? We lucked out with a young man who was informed and we got it about 15 mins before our scheduled time.Once inside, the expedited line seemed to be non-existent? Again, luck shone and we our tickets were scanned and we were directs to a segregated screening area. Once inside you wind through some informative videos and then onto the elevators. The elevator video is awesome - no spoilers. There's a different one coming down so stay keen.Once you arrive, you're corralled into a video viewing area - very cool. There's a very cool feature at the end of the video so have your cameras ready!Once you leave the arrival video area, unless you want your image taken, stay left. It's one of those screens and your picture gets taken.The viewing area is set on two floors with very expansive views. Although it was sunny, there was quite a bit of haze, but the views are spectacular.Noticed quite a few selfie-sticks, annoying actually and although I was able to get some great shots, too many people just sitting on the sills. There is a restaurant, but to be honest, nothing like Windows On The World - an amazing place with a strict dress code and incredible views, especially at sunset. One thing I noticed, in order to get out, they make you walk through the Gift Shop - I lucked out since a side door was open, so I bypassed the store.I have to say I found the architecture of WT1 uninspiring, even the interior? Nondescript and not at all like the former buildings that had this amazing lobby and those great cathedral like arched windows, but things change. "

There were very little queues when we went and so we went through security and were able to head up to the top very quickly.Words cannot describe the views available from the observation deck! They are stunning. A slight downside is that if there is glare from the sun you can\u2019t get the best pictures as you are taking them through glass windows which reflect that glare. It was busy up there, but people were on the whole very patient and would take it in turns to step up to the windows to take in the views / take photos. I never felt rushed at any point and enjoyed the experience. You can rent an iPad for the time you are up there that is set up to give information about the sights seen out of each window. These cost $15 for the rental. I did not rent one but could see plenty of people using them as they walked round the tower.All in all, a very worthwhile trip \u2013 yes there were a few downsides but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do this again if I ever get back to NYC."

While remembering the past, One World Trade Center symbolizes hope for the future and the resilience to bring it back for all the world to see.During construction the building was known as the Freedom Tower. In March 2009, the Port Authority announced it would be known by its name, One World Trade Center. Opened on November 3, 2014, it is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and fourth tallest building in the world. Chicago may argue this point and new building construction may change this designation. Antennas and spires are a touchy subject with architects and those certifying building heights, the CTBUH. With its antenna/spire, One World Trade Center stands at 1776 feet - a reference to 1776 when the Declaration of Independence was signed. Regardless, One World Trade Center is back and stands where 6 World Trade Center was located.If you visit, take the last subway stop at City Hall, then you will only have several blocks to walk. Because the building is so tall the walking distance appears shorter from the subway station. Due to continued construction in the area, you must walk around and between buildings to One World Trade Center. The walk is easy and many sites are in this area (1) the 9/11 Memorial and Museum; (2) St. Paul's Church; (3) Battery Park; (4) Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island embarking on the ferry from Battery Park (4) City Hall; (5) Brooklyn Bridge; and for shoppers (6) Century 21 (people were taking photos of this store)! Many great views from all of these sites located almost next to each other. A short walk to Tribeca or the Stone Street District and you'll find lunch or dinner. For those with any mobility concerns, construction makes the trek somewhat longer at this time. One World Trade Center is definitely worth the time to see this magnificent structure. Thank you New York City!"

Unlike the Twin Towers the building does not allow visitors. The only access to the building for the general public is by separate entrance that leads to the observation deck on the 102nd floor. The observation deck is wrapped around the center of the building, protected by floor to ceiling glass, and affords 360 degrees view. There is no access to the open air, though, like in the Empire State Building. The panoramic view is beautiful, but the reflection on the glass sometimes makes it difficult to take pictures. Tickets are expensive at $32 and may be reserved online. The best time to visit is just before sunset, so as to get both the day view and the night view of the scenery. There are two posts, on the northeast and the southwest of the deck, where guides periodically explain the scenery below. There are other guides who walk around answering questions. The status of One World Observatory as the highest observatory in New York will last for some time, but the One World Trade Center building keeps its title as the highest building in the Western Hemisphere only because of the height of its spire. Measured by rooftop height, 324 Park Avenue building is 28 feet taller, and the soon to be built Nordstrom tower will be taller still. Nonetheless, those two buildings are strictly residential, and do not allow access to the public. The visit to the One World Observatory is very sleek. It starts in a tunnel with mock displays of the natural rock foundations of the building and continues to a fast elevator ride straight to the top. The walls of the elevator are used to project the view of New York going up, and the history of New York going down. Once on top, there is another digital presentation before a screen opens to reveal the view. There are also souvenir photo takers and a gift shop, as well as a restaurant with the best views in a town. Overall, a very enjoyable visit."

First off its completely unorganized. There was one older gentleman outside policing the main entrance since there weren't any signs directing people (ticket holders) where to queue up. The lack of signs and direction continued throughout. The elevator ride up was the highlight of the visit. No maps were offered (that I could find) showing landmarks out the windows. That is because they want visitors to pay extra $$ over the entrance fee to rent an iPad. The other disgrace was the $5 charge for a 16oz bottle of water or Gatorade? $5, really?? Was the same price for fountain soda, but with that I suppose you'd get to have refills. Lastly, the guest photo that can be viewed/purchased at the end of your visit must be viewed/selected on an iPad BEFORE you enter the imaging line as indicated on the ticket. This forced me to stand in numerous lines more than once, because of inadequate communication. Some signs or handouts explaining these things sure would have been useful. Overall I'd skip it. Absolutely visit the 911 museum next door though. That should be a must do for any visitor to Manhattan. Their 1hr guided tour was fantastic and worth every penny."

We assumed that because all timeslots online were still showing as available the day prior to going that it must not be all that busy and we'd be able to get right in but that is NOT the case. Once we got there, the line to get tickets was so long that they were recommending that people use their phones to purchase tickets. We were able to do that, but the time slot was two hours later, so while we waited we visited the 9/11 memorial, had lunch, and walked around the area."

I HATE complaining about military discounts, but One World Observatory talked about offering a \"special discount\" for military members in their press releases leading up to the opening. I couldn't find how much the discount was online, so I went in person only to find $2 off a $32 ticket. In this circumstance, it seems like they wanted to brag about a military discount more than they wanted to offer one.One World Observatory - If there was ever a time when military members deserved a discount, this would be it. You should at least be able to match the 70% off discount that the Top of the Rock offers. With as many american flags as I saw, you seem to want to be a symbol of patriotism. If so, you need to treat our military members accordingly."

            "review": "The Latest Must Do in NYC. Recently opened, this is a new must-do attraction in The Big Apple. Located on the 102nd floor of the One World Trade Center building (formerly called Freedom Tower), it affords spectacular views of the NYC region from a height more than 1600 feet. We went on a beautiful clear morning, and the views were impressive. You need to buy date and time specific tickets at https://oneworldobservatory.com/. We showed up 45 minutes early and were allowed right in BUT it was early in the day and there was no one in line. When we came out an hour later there was a long line. Recommendation 1: Go early in the day. Access and crowd control measures were excellent; all well organized. The elevator rides up and down are really interesting. The walls of the elevators are video screens. On the way up they show what the view would look like starting in about 1600 and aging as you go up. On the way down, it looks like the elevator flies outside the building and circles it. Very cool. Recommendation 2: Be ready if you want to take video\u2014it happens fast. The elevator ride is very fast but smooth. You exit the elevator into a long wide room with a screen on the long wall on which a flashy video about New York City is shown. Recommendation 3: Be ready for what happens at the end of the video. The observatory itself is on two floors; one on which you can walk all the way around to see the whole city and the other with a caf\u00e9 and gift shop. Be aware that EVERYONE is taking selfies with the skyline, which can get annoying. We were never more than two deep to get to the floor-to-ceiling windows: but if it were more crowded, it could take a while to get up to the window (to take your selfie). There is a coffee and juice bar with sweets, a counter for roll-up and sandwiches, and a full-service caf\u00e9 and bar."

            "review": "Stunning views but glass is disappointing for photography!. To begin with, the price for the observatory is 32$ which I think is a bit overpriced. The building is magnificent. The entire experience right from the entrance to the elevators to the presentation is super! The entrance to the tower has various digital presentations and facts on a rocky wall. All four sides of the elevator are digitally enhanced with NYC views. The presentation in the cinema theatre when u get on floor 101 was the best bit. You think its a normal presentation with some NYC facts and when you are least expecting all the slides go up in the wall revealing a 360 panoramic view of NewYork City! The observatory offers some stunning views of the NYC bridges, statue of Liberty, Empire State, Chrysler building and others. But its not as great for photography as the Top of the Rock because it has glass panels all throughout which make it difficult to get good pictures even with a good camera. The observatory has an open bar and a small caf\u00e9 where you could relax, eat and get great views too. As it has newly opened, its highly commercialised. They offer an ipad audio tour which is an additional 15$. Also, they click some pics for you with artificial NYC backgrounds which are 20$ each. Overall, great views and an awesome digital experience but disappointing for photography. Note that the best time to visit is the evening slot in summers as the sunlight is too harsh during the day. Go around 7.30 in summers where u can see the views in daylight, can see the sunset at arnd 8.30 and then twilight."

You can go to the Louvre and see the Mona Lisa in 5 minutes, of you can experience the Louvre. Same here. Invest some time and a few extra bucks and this becomes a memory for life and both the center and highlight of your NYC visit instead of just 5 minutes of amazing views.Tip 1: Buy tickets online and skip the lines. Many people spend more time in line than they do up in the observatory . Tips 2. As you head to the elevators take the time to read the stuff on the rocks etc... instead rushing to get there first. Just like the lines at a well done amusement park attraction there is a lot to enjoy here before the actual \"ride\" begins.Tip 3. Be ready for the \"view\" on the elevator going up. It is amazing. I won't spoil it but make sure you've put away the phone, the camera and if you have kids you have told them to be ready for the experience on the elevator. It's only 60 seconds so don't miss any of it being distracted by something.Tip 4: Don't rush to the windows once the beautiful arrival video is complete. That's what the crowds will do and you'll be fighting with them. Instead go to one of the other two floors and start you viewing there.Tip 5. Rent the explorer ipad for 15 dollars. When ever I go to a museum I always book a tour or rent headphones so I can understand the story behind what I'm seeing. Otherwise its just pictures and statues. Same here. Want to just see building and water or hear and see the story of NYC and its best sites including helicopter rides? If the answer is yes get the explorer. You'll be mesmerized for at least 1 hour, you'll get tips for the rest of your stay in NYC and just like the best museum guides and audio programs there is special attractions for younger children. It will even save a cloudy day with poorer views.Tip 6: Visit the observatory at the start of your stay in NYC as you'll get info and tips on other places in this amazing city (see tip 5).Tip 7: Don't miss the Portal which lets you look straight down to the ground through the floor!"

We bought our tickets in advance, before the attraction was even open yet, since we came from across the Atlantic and I was afraid there won't be any tickets left. Paid 150$ for a family of five. Our view: white. *Completely* white (clouds). Not a \"bad\" visibility, but *zero* visibility. I understand that whether is not a controllable issue, but taking people's money for zero return is quite impudent. They were selling tickets as usual as we came in, as if there was anything to pay for.The person in charge absolutely refused to let us come again with the same tickets another day, or even to allow for discounted new tickets.From the website of The Top of the Rock: \"Guests will be advised about weather conditions and visibility prior to entry. Top of the Rock will not refund tickets in the case of inclement weather, however we will reissue your ticket for a future time and date.\" Now THAT's a way to treat customers!Other than the view, the elevator video is very nice and unique, but can also be freely watched on Youtube. Absolutely not worth 150$."

On a clear day, the view is mind-blowing. But at nearly 100 stories above ground, you're above the clouds - and if there is cloud cover, that may be all you see. With tickets for 9:45 am, we got right into the building, and there were just a few short periods of waiting inside. The elevator ride alone is worth the price of admission. I think the attraction is managed very well. It's not horribly crowded - you can get right up to the windows to take in the stunning views. There's now another great reason to come to New York City's rapidly transforming downtown area - and this is it."

While I didn't stop at the museum, I recommend you purchase your tickets in advance as you will get through and up to the observatory level quick. The line was very long for those looking to purchase tickets, while I was able to take the advance purchase line and walk right in. Kind of like when your online to board a plane and elite diamond passengers are able to bypass the line and board at anytime. It was a hazy day, but still had a good view.

Decided to get tickets online only in the morning on the day of visit itself, as weather the few days before was really bad, and surprisingly it wasn't difficult to get a time slot just pass noon. The line to buy tickets is pretty long if you didn't book online and I think it costs more than the $32 admission ticket to get in.The line waiting to get in was quite long and we were held back slightly passed our timeslot, but once you get pass the security you don't feel that crowded anymore.The walk through the tunnel before the elevator was quite unusual, and the ride up was even more of an experience with the elevator rocketing up to the 102th floor in mere seconds without feeling any air pressure! Everything moved so quickly including the digital imagery of the city skyline.As you walk around the main observation deck on the 100th floor, the views of Manhattan and the surounding neighbourhood are just under your feets. Particularly impressive was the view of the East River with the bridges over to Brooklyn, and the circular Sky Portal projecting the real time image of the street directly below.Looking north gives you a true sense of what really Manhattan looks like beyond the street map. It is a pity that Central Park is no where in sight with all the other buildings towering ahead.For the shutterbugs it is best to bring along a polarising lens to get a good shot through the thick glass panels."

We were able to observe New York City from 102 floors up and we could see just how much we'd managed to explore, and just how much there was left for us to explore in the future. We were at the One World Observatory on opening day and all the staff were extremely excited to be there. (NB: If you follow the signs for the 'Observatory' through the 'P.A.T.H.' underground hub, you will be able to avoid all the queues outside. We did anyway! Whether or not everyone else has discovered this yet, I do not know!) They were being very strict on ticket times though and we had to wait at the side for 15 minutes before they would let us through. We also observed a lot of people had purchased 11PM tickets online instead of 11AM tickets and were being turned away. Perhaps the website should offer ticket times in 24hr clock to avoid confusion?After security the queuing does get a little bit boring especially going through the 'bedrock' of NYC. They could do with a couple of monitors in here showing was was on the screens just before we got to the 'bedrock' section as we were ushered through that part of the line quite quickly and didn't get a chance to watch the entire video.The observation deck is split over 3 floors, so don't waste your time trying to see the view when you first walk into the observatory. Go down the stairs/escalator and you will get the exact same view, but with a lot more space to view it! Enjoy!"

I know this place just opened not too long ago but they need to seriously figure out a better way to deal with the crowds and ticket times. We pre-purchased tickets online (your best bet) for a 2:15 appointment time. We showed up at the base of the tower about 20 minutes before our time slot and it was absolute pandemonium. No one had any idea where to go for their ticket times or what to do. There were a few employees standing at the stairs trying to direct people but it was chaos. There were lines of people everywhere that were just like us, had no idea where to stand or go. Some people were trying to buy tickets while standing in the already purchased ticket lines. They started calling appointment times over a mega phone and people were rushing and pushing.  My suggestion would be to have clearly marked signs everywhere informing people where they need to be and what time they should be there. It was a Sunday and probably more crowded that a weekday but something has to change especially when you have so many non-American speaking people that have no idea what is going on. For the amount of money that everyone is paying for tickets, I think there can be a way to have electronic signs at the head of these lines that update as the time slots occur. It would just make it so much easier for everyone. Other than that the elevator ride is fantastic and the views are second to none. You can take as much time as you want up in the observatory. There are bathrooms as well as a place to get something to eat/drink, and a gift shop. The price of the tickets are relatively on the higher side, but the views are tremendous and definitely worth it."

Prepare to be touched.There are cafes at the top of the observatory including one with fast food like yogurt and fruit.If you have a choice between this or the Empire State Building - choose the One World Observatory. The Empire State Building has been over-commercialized and it will take you far more time due to the number of exhibits and you will be overwhelmed by solicitors trying to sell you tours."

I was very excited to go to the top of the new World Trade Center Freedom Tower but it was a disappointment for the cost and they nickeled and dimed us the whole visit. They don't have their act together to move people there effectively while preserving the excitement. Getting there from the 9/11 memorial there were no signs to direct folks WITH timed tickets vs no ticket to completely separate entrances. Person there told people but signage would have been much more efficient vs that person saying it over and over. Ssecurity checkpoint was significant which I completely understand but security guy said I had a water bottle and emptied my whole bag only I had no water bottle. Time to go up then. They bring you in the elevator and it is truly fast like a rocket to the 100th floor. You first walk thru what looks like fake bedrock saying it's built on bedrock. Guess we then feel better that it won't fall down if something happens. At the top when elevator stops, You get your picture taken against a green screen that looks like NY skyline and given a ticket for a 20 photo at the end. (I think this was where but might be before elevators.) at top, You get herded into a long narrow theater where they show a disjointed short film about New York with loud music and lots of movement to build excitement. Then, they bring up the curtain to reveal floor to ceiling windows with a breathtaking view up toward midtown and the Empire State. Then they lower the wall within 20 seconds and ask you to move to the right and out of the area into curtained corridors over the windows cover the spectacular view which was frustrating since I came for the view. Then, you come through these curtained areas and they descend on you to sell you rental of an iPad to tell you what all the buildings are for another $15 after it was already $32 per ticket to go up. The guy said he would LET my sister and I share. I said no thanks. Then past another curtained area...where is the damn view??!? There was no good flow. Don't plan on eating or drinking anything. It was 10.85 for a 16oz diet coke and a hot dog. No posted pricing. There were also no seats outside the cafe area unless you went into the fine dining area. No areas for folks to sit even away from the windows. In the gift shop there were workers standing around and not processing purchases. It was ok but felt like I would have liked 30 rock or Empire State Building as much"

I previously visited the Twin Towers and Empire State Building so was glad to be one of the first to see the views here and especially glad I booked for the baking hot Saturday not the stormy Sunday (where with thunderstorms and clouds all you can see is a grey window).So check the forecast, take your camera and take your time. I was in there for about 2 hours, making use of the Free Wifi to FaceTime home and take lots of pictures.Souvenirs are outrageously expensive. Was about $20 just for a pack of cards. Food was expensive but considering the views not too bad.Staff are good and the video displays are gimmicky but quite interesting.Avoid the iPad extra - not worth it for extra $15 you can recognise yourself the major landmarks or just ask one of the many staff members in blue shirts.The lift (elevator) journey up is pretty cool. The lines once you're inside are OK, maybe 15 minutes tops.Still good views all over NY but whereas with the Empire State you can see Central Park, despite being so high up, you can't see it from here."

It is stated to be fine dining , but it is far from that with plain wooden tables no table linen. I had dinner there on Sunday June 7 at 8.30pm. First of all ordered some glasses of wine and they had cork in them. This should have not been served to the table. One waiter took them away without as much as a comment, another then apologized and then finally after 10 minutes the new glasses of wine appeared. One of our guests was celeriac allergy and the courses had to be checked or returned due as not suitable after asking the server at time of order. We ordered the one special on offer as a starter and was later informed that only one available for the table so we had to re choose. On Deserts the offer was restrictive due to more of the limited menu not being available. Overall the food was good but not exceptional. I would say not worth the price and the staff who served us were not very professional in dealing with our complaints. In fact the Manager never came to our table to review our service. The other issue that bothered us was the first option on the menu is a larger steak and the meal price then goes up to $110 . Also no tap water available only bottled. The service charge was added. I got it removed due to the poor service. In fact the waiter gave me a stare I had never seen before when I informed him to withdraw the service charge. He told me he would get the manager but the manager never appeared. When I tried to explain why the service was not good enough he was not interested. Save your money and go to a nice restaurant."

First, while at One World, visit the 911 Pools and grounds. They use to be only assessable with a ticket and were closed grounds, they are now easily assessable but still equally as moving. Second, visiting One World is VERY organized. I would also say purchase tickets online and PRINT THEM OUT. It makes it easy on everyone. (While you can arrive with the purchased tickets on your phone.. AGAIN... PRINT THEM OUT!)Everyone with tickets enters at a specified time. You should arrive no earlier than 15 min. prior... if you arrive earlier you will just be waiting longer. 15 min is enough. I have to give a few SHOUT OUTS to the following workers who REALLY made the line, and waiting, ORGANIZED and pleasant....Kyair, Luigy, Teurean and Tissuea... You all worked very hard and it was appreciated.Once inside the EXPERIENCE really does begin and surprisingly it was NOT crowded.I don't want to ruin it so.. once at the top it is AMAZING!!! 360 degree views.. SO much to look at. there are also restaurants at the top and to food was very pleasing. It was nice to get a snack while looking out on New York!We stayed at the top for about an hour and a half and it never got TOO crowded. Again.. not to ruin it... the Experience doesn't stop until you are back at street level.One World Observatory is A MUST if you are going to New York. Again..

This observation experience allows one to see the skyline of Manhattan looking north, and to view the waters around the Statue of Liberty and surrounding areas. This is the highest place in Manhattan, higher than the Empire State Building. The experience starts with being shot up some 1200 feet in less than 60 seconds in an interior elevator, whose walls have a multimedia display of what you would be seeing if the elevator was on the outside of the building. The observation area itself is quite large and circular. However there are no chairs or seating areas, so many people camp out on the low ledges next to the windows, making photography a challenge. The Empire State building's 86th Floor observation deck has an exterior walkway open to the elements, unlike this one.  There is an area where there is a caf\u00e9 and bar with limited seating arrangements, and a pricey sit-down restaurant called \"One\".  This attraction just opened on May 29, 2015 so ticket reservations are a must. One can do the following in one day with some prior planning and reservations: Staten Island Ferry, Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, 9/11 Memorial and Museum, One World Observatory - it makes for a full day, however."

I had checked the weather to make sure it would be sunny before ordering tickets online the day before. Ticket prices are Adult $32, Senior $30, Child $26. Through Sept 7th open from 9 am to midnight 7 days a week. Tickets said to meet outside at the Intersection of Vesey and West St. 15 minutes prior to your timed ticket. We waited 1/2 hour outside until we got into the building. The only thing I wondered about is what do they do when the weather is lousy. You enter the building and go down the escalator to the Global Welcome Center where the check your ticket and you go through security. Next you go through the fake bedrock that the building sits on and hear the \" voices\" & video of the people that built 1 World Trade Center. Then you go into the Skypod elevator with images of the bedrock that takes you to the 102nd floor in 60 seconds.My ears popped a few times. I couldn't believe how fast and smooth the ride was. The elevator and floor to ceiling images of NYC from the 1500's to today was cool. When you get off you are ushered into the \"See forever theater\" that has random images of the streets of NYC. I thought this a waste of time, but thoroughly enjoyed the surprise that was next. The wall lifts and you see a spectacular, short, real view of NYC.Then you can go to the Main Observatory on the 100th floor with panoramic views of the city and beyond. Getting pictures of ourselves was tricky. Lots of times we were in shadow. Later on the sun shone in on us and we were able to get some nice pictures of people and the skyline of NYC. It was a beautiful clear day so we could see the Statue of Liberty and all of NYC and even the mountains beyond.The SKY PORTAL you can step on and it gives you a real time view of the street below. We decided to eat at the One Mix restaurant on top because you where able to sit down. The One Caf\u00e9 just had tables with no chairs. the food was good and the view spectacular.There is a gift shop as you exit to the elevators down. On the way down you get a view of NYC at night probably shot in an helicopter.We spent a couple hours in the observatory. The crowds weren't too bad. Overall a great experience if visiting NYC."

The views once you get to the viewing areas are very impressive, but the whole layout is still being refined and seems awkward. After buying tickets at ground level you go down escalators through metal detectors and security and then walk through a long fake rock underground area (the rocks are fiberglass) and this will probably be a long waiting area during the high season.Getting off the elevators you are crowded into a wide area and shown a video which seems to just be a time waster, until it ends and the backdrop opens to reveal the view. Then everyone is bustled out one end and past the first add-on booth where they try to rent you an iPad with info on it. The whole layout is not well defined and it seems like you have to go down and up several times before you are \"allowed\" to actually get some good views.In another area they lead you in front of a green screen and take photos, sort of like when you board a cruise ship. The photos will be available for sale later.There is a fake glass floor area which is really just a video feed. Nothing like the real glass floors in other towers like the CN in Toronto.We went to the sit down restaurant area and it only has two food options: a cheese plate and a salami plate. We ordered one of each and waited a long time for them to arrive. The staff was so apologetic that they gave use another round of drinks for free. Bottom line - they are still working out start-up issues in regards to crowd flow and service. I am sure this tourist site will be immensely popular and there will be long lines very soon. The views out of the windows are impressive, the layout and service inside are not."

I got the tickets for June 1st, and you had to pick a time to visit -- I picked 7 pm. On June 1st the forecast called for heavy rain and fog. I called customer service to see if I could exchange the tickets for another day, but nobody picked up the guest services phone, and the voice mailbox was full. We went to the venue and asked about changing the date when we got there. They told us they were not responsible for the weather, as they claimed in their website. I understand that, but there has to be an exception when they cannot offer the service that their website states --best views of Manhattan. I can understand limited visibility, but when we were up on floor 102, all you could see was a white window. You couldn't even feel that you were high up. Nothing. It was like staring at a blank wall.They offered an iPad with the \"explorer experience\", that would give you information about the buildings and places you could see from the observatory (if there wasn't fog!), but you had to pay an extra $15. Since we couldn't see anything, it would have been good customer service to rent it for free to the handful of unlucky visitors of that foggy day. But they didn't.When we came down I went to the Guest Services window and asked to speak to the manager, she was not even nice about it, and just said \"tickets are non-refundable, not exchangeable\", and that It said so on their website. I said that their website also said that we'd have the best views of the city, and that a day like that, with 0 visibility, should be an exception. She offered no solution at all. They just got our $32/per ticket money --for nothing. I felt cheated.My advice --Don't buy tickets in advance unless you know there's going to be nice weather!"

I debated heavily whether to pay that to see yet another tower but was chatting with a group of Canadian tourists the night before who had been in NYC all week, and they told me that it was well worth a visit. Remember Canada has the CN Tower (separate review) which we saw several years ago and really enjoyed, but according to the Canadian fellow, One World was taller and better. We got in line the next day for our turn. I have to say that the process for getting into the line to enter the building is a mess and needs badly to be improved. There is no signage telling you where to go if you don't already have a ticket (and I recommend getting tickets ahead of time online) and when you do get to the proper line, people that have paid for \"premium access\" are still going to get in ahead of you. However, we did get inside within 5 minutes of our 2:30 time and the flow seems pretty good once you are inside. You walk past and around some of the exposed bedrock foundation which states that this is the strongest built building in the world. It is striking to look at, I have to say, inside and out. After watching a short presentation, they raise the window panels and give you a glimpse of the view. Then you go to another line to wait for an elevator. These are a bank of 5 high speed lifts that get groups up to the 102nd floor in about a minute. Covering the windows, for some reason, are floor to ceiling drapes which completely obscure the views that you're there to see unless you move the drapes. If you walk two floors below, you get the full and unobstructed views. That is worth $32 to me, but no more. Of course, there are the overprices gift shops, way overpriced restaurant and bar, and verbal presentations selling different NYC tourist experiences. I guess the theory is that the longer you stay, the more you'll spend. I myself am not turned on by a $5 bottle of water or muffin or a $10 bottle of beer. Plenty of people were partaking though. There are stands outside too that offer rubber bracelets ($5 donation) or a color photo book ($21.75.) If you go, bring lots of money, as I have said about some other cities we've been to. This was great for someone who hasn't been to NYC yet or loves high towers."

I'd guess that we queued until 4 before we got in - You get to security, get your bag scanned etc - just like at the airport - then there is a wall of TV screens of construction guys - this takes around half an hour. You are then filtered single file through a bedrock exhibition which takes another 20 mins or so of shuffling. Then you get to another line which is for the lifts. Once up there there is yet another short presentation before the skyline is dramatically revealed to you - its all nicely done if a little long winded. Amazing views of the city, you can see right up to the park and beyond, lady liberty in the distance, jersey city, brooklyn and queens and the brooklyn bridge - really worth the wait!!"

Visited yesterday, the day started out rainy but cleared up nicely by the time of my 1:30 pm ticket time, I only reserved my ticket the day before online, (to my surprise there was availability) and I paid attention to the weather report. If you reserve ahead of time and the weather's bad, you're going to be disappointed and complain, so doing it the way I did made a lot of sense. Yes, there were crowds, and lots of long lines for different times, staff were nearby trying to explain things but it did seem a bit noisy and disorganized outside on the sidewalk. Getting off the PATH train across the street made for a bit of an adventure, a few exits were blocked, and crosswalks were closed due to ongoing construction, so it seemed going up, down and all around was necessary. Perhaps in the rush to open the observatory, convenience in getting out of the PATH station and to the site was overlooked. Anyway, the elevator ride up was pretty amazing, viewing the history of Manhattan on the way up, from the 1500s to the present. I was thinking it would have been really amazing if the elevators had actual windows with real views of the outside, but this was the next best thing. The short film right after you get off the elevator was nothing much, and a bit of a waste of time, but at the end the wall rises, and the real view appears, and it's spectacular. Read a lot of nitpicking complaints here, but you get off the elevator on the 102nd floor. Really, how many times in one's lifetime can you say you've done that? The clear views all around are just amazing. There are no seats, but I didn't come here to sit. Yes, it's crowded but it's to be expected. The price is a bit on the high side, but it's New York City, and it's quite an experience."

However this was an issue to one of the members of staff who stated we weren't allowed to sit there Because we didn't order any food (yet others were sitting with just drinks but nothing was said to them). So we got up and moved to the cafe areas seats which was next to bar area, and again this was another issue for another member of staff, who insisted we couldn't sit there unless our alcohol was in a plastic cup. BE AWARE of some staff being a bit of a jobsworth and this ruined our overall experience. Put it this way, there are better places in new york to see the city skyline"

Apparently the presentation in the elevator is excellent, however if you are right up against the wall and are short statured, like me, you won't see much of it. Yes, the view at the top is lovely, we're talking NEW YORK HERE... OF COURSE it's spectacular. Be prepared for them to want you to open your wallet even more once you are at the top... souvenirs, a bar, a restaurant, photos like on a cruise ship, renting ipads for tours, etc. They have found lots and lots of reasons to try to get you to spend more money. I know that's what makes the world go round... but after the unspeakable tragedy happened there, it just feels like they turned an opportunity to be a little bit better into another way to make big bucks, and instead of presenting a dignified place to see New York, they let Disney handle it. I half expected a costume character called \"One World-Y\" to wander around waving for photo ops with little kids. That said, the view is incredible. Will I go up again? Nope.

But for $32 a single ticket entry is expensive for what you get.The first thing I noticed before going down into the security area was the cheap faux plastic marble on the walls. Just tap it with your fingers and you can see it's very cheap finishings. Passing security there is a neat waiting area where you can dress yourself again (put on your belts, etc.) as it's airport style security. They have a neat board that when they scan your ticket it knows where you came from and it says \"guests now arriving from...\" and where you are from appears on the screen.Your are first hurdled through a fake exhibit of bedrock. It's cheap plastic again and I was a little disappointed by it. It felt too much like a disney land line. Just tap the walls and you'll know it's fake. They could have splurged for nicer. Then you get to wait in the area where the elevators are. We were there on a miserably rainy day so it wasn't very crowded. A lot of people opted to skip their entry tickets. Then we went up the elevator which was fun and they put you in a holding area where they show a 3 minute video that ends by the screen lifting up and revealing your view - which for us was a wall of white clouds. Couldn't see anything.For $32 I'm glad I went but I thought it was too pricey. The finishings in the place weren't as nice as I'd have expected. Plastic? Really? But I am still glad I went. This continues my tradition of going up to the WTC (the old building and now the new) and only seeing a wall of white. Haha!Once you make it up to the top, you only need 30 minutes or so there. The long wait you'll have is through security and in line for the elevators and in line for the movie they hurdle you through. Your timed entry ticket cannot get you past those lines... it only lets you in the building itself at that time."

You go down before you go up, supposedly into the bedrock below the building but it's clearly fake - that's the Disney bit. The elevator ride up is superb - watch out for the brief appearance from the twin towers. The presentation once you come out of the elevator is pointless - we couldn't hear most of what was said and the video is just random New York street scenes. Once you finally, finally get to the viewing level it's a great 360 experience although taking photos through the windows can be tricky due to all the smears and fingerprints on the glass and the reflections if you don't have your camera right up against the glass."

The layout of the observatory is very well done from the entrance to the observatory deck. I must also give complete compliments to the staff. Everyone was smiling and helpful and energetic. They made it all a great experience. Obviously the view is spectacular. We \"rented\" the iPad for $15 which give you the opportunity to walk around and identify all the sites you are looking at so it was definitely well worth it. There is no time limit on your visit but there are no seats available in the observation floor so it may be a challenge for anyone who have a hard time standing for a longer period of time. Definitely buy your tickets on line before you go so you can walk right in. The line to buy tickets was very long and a waste of time."

Some of the architectural elements at the bottom are really amazing (near the exits) . The presentation and videos about 9/11 are very moving and help to set a mood while you wait to go to the top. Once you're there an elevator whisks you up. The video that plays while you're ascending was a bit cheezy but kids will be sure to love it. As a photographer i wanted to get great photos of the area like Top of the Rock and ESB. Unfortunately there's just way too much light that is reflected off the glass windows. If several people are standing behind you waiting to take your spot then that's a workaround. there were also some corners where you can sit your camera down flat and take some decent pics that way but not many that had little light. Otherwise the views are superb. An open air terrace would have been great. I arrived just before a storm moved in and the place quickly emptied once all you could see were clouds. I would return but this time before sunset."

Hard to put a $$$ value on the sensational view of New York City from the 100th floor of 1WTC. The truth of the matter is that you could spend hours on the Observatory. Those of us who were fortunate enough to have been on top of the Twin Towers will be surprised: this is a totally different experience. The view is a lot better now, perhaps due to new technology that allows for extraordinary windows on the entire city. And what about the elevator? I know, I know. Many stories have been written about the 47-second movie of New York evolving over the course of 500 years. But I have to admit: it is pretty extraordinary. I love the concept and the final product. You ride up the elevator an on three of the four walls you see projected images of the evolving landscape on downtown Manhattan. I must admit: I was fortunate enough to ride the elvator with only two other people, therefore I enjoyed the full experience. Not sure what it is like in a crowded elevator where perhaps it is difficult to fully appreciate the experience."

We went on the first Monday of opening after buying tickets the month before.It was a terrible day weather wise when we arrived but I assumed that there would still be a view, possibly above the clouds which would have still made it worthwhile. As there was no warning or signs and people were still coming down, this further reinforced it would still be worthwhile.The lift up was he highlight, showing New York develop over the years but it was over far too quickly. The big ' reveal' is a good idea and could be ok on a nice day, but nothing special. What we got was just white, you could not see anything and it looked like someone had painted the windows white. I don't see how they can't warn you beforehand and feel this is a total rip off. I would have been even more concerned if I had bought the ticket that day which hundreds of people were being allowed to do with no warning at all.Inside there isn't that much to do. A restaurant, a shop and a couple of presentations that were ok and again nothing special.I had seen advertised before I went a glass floor you could walk over that gave the impression you are actually walking above the city. As it was raining outside you could clearly see this was just a recording of the city below. Another disappointment.When I got back to the bottom I asked if we could be refunded or if we could come back the following day if the weather was ok. The women just looked at me and said no and then looked away. I found her very rude.A very poor experience and I don't think this will offer anything better than the Empire State or Top of the Rock. At least you aren't stuck behind windows there."

As expected, the views are awesome, and the visuals on the elevator ride up are amazing. They have really planned well for crowd control as well so people with a reservation move along. I am honestly not sure if the observation deck was complete..... There were literally no signs or information indicating what buildings or other sights we were looking at all the way around the observation deck. For someone who does not know NYC, we did not always know what we were looking at, for example, the Statue of Liberty was obvious, but we did not know which island was Ellis island. There were no signs or people to tell us or to ask questions. All the employees were downstairs working in crowd control which was excellent, but no one to actually guide while you were up ther. They had iPads for rent, with a guided tour. We did take this option, as we felt we had already paid $32 per person to be ther. The people who did rent iPads were walking around looking down at their iPads to see what their view was of, rather than looking at the real thing. Kind of sad. I wish they would put more of the manpower at each window for information and questions,. Also, I am very hopeful that signs indicating what each view is showing are still to come, and were just not ready yet."

They have interactive tablets you can get to see what the view would be, based on the direction you're facing out, but they want to shake you down for an additional $15. So I paid $32 for a glorified 47-second elevator ride (video presentation on three sides). At least I avoided paying $47 total for the privilege of gazing at an iPad.The Observatory can't control the weather of course. And instead of the timed ticket I could have bought a flex ticket instead for $85 (weekdays) or $90 (weekends), but I think you can understand why I declined.One World Observatory really needs to rethink their ticket options and provide a reasonable remedy for zero visibility days, like maybe offer tablets for free or half price. Until they do, they're just going to be ripping their customers off every time the weather turns sour!Look at all the 1-star reviews, One World Observatory \u2014 and get a clue."

Fortunately, the weather was beautiful that day so the long wait outside wasn't too bad. There were lines everywhere, and the staff was clearly new at this, so there was some confusion. Once inside the building, it ran pretty efficiently. The elevator ride is fast and smooth, and I have to agree with one of the other reviews that with the elevator full of people it was nearly impossible to view the video that was being shown on the walls. Ditto for the \"movie\" that was shown when you got to the top - it was very nice, but you're standing so close to it (maybe 10-15 feet away) and the screen is probably 60 feet or more across, so it was really hard to see other than what was right in front of you. But the \"reveal\" of the view was definitely quite spectacular. The views overall were beautiful, but taking photos was problematic for two reasons - many people were sitting along the windows so it's hard to get an unobstructed view, and secondly the glare from the glass makes it difficult to get photos without reflections in them. There was definitely a lack of seating - actually none unless you were buying food at the restaurant, and this resulted in many people sitting along the bottom of the viewing windows which made it even more difficult to see. They really should have included some benches or other seating for people to be able to sit for a few minutes (but maybe they don't want visitors to tarry too long?). Overall, I would rate this attraction as very good, although the $30 price tag seems a little steep, and would be really disappointing if the views were obstructed by weather. We bought our tickets online several days earlier and they are timed tickets, so you have to specify the time you want when you make the purchase. But if it's a rainy or foggy day, that money would be pretty much wasted. It was extremely busy and crowded the day we went which was their opening day, so hopefully once things settle down it won't be so bad. We were able to get to an elevator to go down pretty quickly so there were no long lines to exit. In many ways, it felt similar to the Seattle Space Needle but without any outside viewing options which was unfortunate."

The list journey to the 102nd floor and the initial 'revealing' of the view was the highlight for us, very spectacular. What I think does let it down is the 'enclosed' nature of the observation deck, compared to the Empire state or Rockefeller observation decks which are outside you get this disjointed feeling - i.e. no wind, no sounds etc. The view is spectacular but unfortunately being behind the windows (covered in hand prints and greasy nose marks!) spoils photographs.

There were plenty of helpful staff around the entrance to point you in the right direction if you get lost. Once you're inside the building you feel as if you're queuing for a ride at a theme park. The experience in the elevator is really impressive and is really fast. But once you're up at the top it's just unbelievable. The experience is really positive. There isn't any reference to 9/11, just a focus on the amazing 360 views of New York. I'm not sure if we were just lucky with our timing, but we managed to get 2 seats at the bar without waiting at all and the service was great. There were 45 min wait times for food though and you weren't able to order food at the bar as it was really busy.

Unfortunately due to the formal opening proceedings over running earlier that day meant all the viewing times were running about an hour late. When we arrived to the building there were queues of visitors in front of the entrances and down the side of the building and we thought we wouldn\u2019t get in for hours but this wasn\u2019t the case as the staff called out for anyone with tickets for a certain time to come forward and took us to the entrance.After proceeding through security checks we made our way to the lifts passing showreels of interviews of some of the people connected to this new building so this made the route to lifts more interesting. The lift ride and the short presentation was another experience - but I won\u2019t say anymore as I don\u2019t want to spoil it for anyone visiting.Finally in the viewing area \u2013 well what can I say but WOW! The views are amazing not just of Manhattan but into New Jersey, Brooklyn etc. You can rent tablets that pinpoint particular landmarks/buildings, we didn\u2019t do this as we have been to NY before so felt confident in spotting places ourselves but I guess they would be helpful for anyone not that familiar with NY. It would have been even better if there was a viewing area outside to take better photos like you can at the Empire State/Top of the Rock viewing platforms \u2013 but I can also understand why there isn\u2019t.Overall - after the slight delay getting to the viewing deck I would say it was definitely worth the wait and we will plan to return but next time in the evening to experience Manhattan at night."

There was very little focus, if any, on the actual events of 9/11, but instead focused on the incredible views. The elevator travels 102 floors in 46 seconds, one of the fastest in the world. As you rise, the walls take on the development of the area over the years, starting with bedrock, rising into swamp, then small buildings, all the way into the skyline you see today. You are then shepherded into a long narrow room for a short film, after which the screen rises and you get your first view from 102 stories in the air. People clapped, cheered, and cried. It was incredibly dramatic. Then you can walk 360 degrees for views of the entire city. Not to be missed! There is also a lounge and restaurant, gift shop, and staff to answer all your questions. We were visitors number 13,571!!!"

The whole experience is designed to excite - the 47 second elevator ride has suround sound and vision, a virtual bird's eye view of Manhattan rising up from the bedrock through the centuries to the present day. Then the anticipation as we file into a darkened room for a minute long kaleidoscope of New York life before the screen rises to reveal the City skyline beneath us in all its glory. The crowd cheered such is the impact. Then onto the observation deck proper where you can wander at will photographing the various Boroughs of New York at you own pace. Only 150 people enter at any one time so there is no sense of overcrowding and there is no-one ushering people on.The glass reflects shadows and hand and breath prints so that the visitor will inevitably end up in someone else's photo.There is a little visitors' shop and a restaurant but given that it was opening day the line was too long to sample its fare.The ride down is virtual too.

To look down from that elevation on familiar tall landmarks like the Empire State and the Chrysler is quite an experience. And you really can see the curvature of the earth.One more amazing thing, as well - the smoothest and quietest lift ascent you'll ever have made!But the level of organisation on that first day was appalling. Despite pre-booked tickets, the queue was endless and the attempts to move people through it confused. It was a good thing good will (generally) prevailed.My other issue was that the whole experience felt a bit Disney-fied.

It didn't take much time to get the tickets or get to the top. Nothing was marked very well but I am sure they are working that out. It was day one. So I am overlooking that.The elevator ride is fast and very entertaining. There are two different shows in the elevator, one on the way up and another on the way down. Both were very good. The view was great from the obeservation deck but the glare from the interior lights was pretty bad on the windows. There is no open deck, all is behind glass. The observation deck is completely enclosed. The glare makes it very difficult to take pictures. If you take a hoodie or some other dark piece of material with you, you can shield your camera lense against the glass and get some great pictures. IMO, the views from the Rock and Emprie State Building are as good if not better because you can get on an open deck with no glass. It took us about 30 minutes to get down. The line wrapped the observation deck twice, but it moved fast.If you are interested in the notoriety. Go up the Trade Tower. If you want the view and you want to see these two towers, select the Rock. If you want A really great view where you can see the park and the Statue of Liberty. Then go with the Empire State Building."

The view of midtown and the Empire State Building is nice, though not spectacular; everything looks so tiny. We went around 7:30pm, so we watched the sunset over Jersey - again, not the most exciting thing.

Because of the bad weather we weren't expecting amazing views but the whole of the top half of the building was actually in cloud so we could see a grand total of nothing! Visibility was zero. We didn't hang around and when we got to the bottom we asked about a refund policy and were told that there were no refunds or options to change to a different date. My husband pointed out that when we arrived no one told us the visibility was at zero however the woman on the counter pointed out we were in fact told when we arrived as our ticket had been stamped to say low visibility. Of course we weren't told why they were stamping it at the time and infact you could barely even make it out when we looked.

We had 9:15 tickets (the second time slot of the day) and we were in the security screening line by 9:15. The elevator ride is touted as an important part of the experience, but it left me frustrated. The elevators hold 15 people and they are not enormous. So we were packed tight to the walls, making it difficult to see the video images that moved quickly as we ascended. The elevator presentation was not like the media coverage which was obviously shot in an empty elevator! As we leave the elevator we assembled for a rather hokey 5 minute film that was also difficult to process. We were lined up close to the screen with 3D representations of building forms, so that some portions of the video jut out a foot or more, which I found distracting. A tourist would get a lot more out of that I suppose than anyone familiar with the city. The crowd did clap as the screen lifts to reveal the skyline. The 3 levels of viewing are not immense, but rather feel like enormous hallways - not the drama that the Twin Towers had. Likewise the windows feel shorter and smaller than the original. Children loved the exhibit with a glass floor above a video of a street scene. There is no outdoor space which is definitely a drawback, given that Empire State has that exciting element. Staff was friendly and helpful and obviously proud to be part of the history. I think the attraction is overpriced."

Beware the potential for low cloud: if you get to the top and there is absolutely nothing to see, there is no refund, no option to return at another time, no nothing.Now, I understand that the weather is totally outside the control of the staff there. But here's the issue. When we arrived, we could see that clouds were covering the mast and we specifically asked the guide at the entrance if you would be able to see anything. We were repeatedly assured that there were fantastic views at that time. So up we went. Through TSA-style security including getting our tickets stamped (more on this later), up the elevator to stand in queue to watch a short video presentation then out to the observation deck. We were shocked to find that we were in dense cloud and there was no view at all. The staff were wandering around looking a little worried, talking amongst themselves as to what should be done in such a situation (clearly they hadn't planned or trained for such an event). So back down we went to the \"Client Services\" area to ask for a replacement ticket so we could come back at another time when the weather was clear. No such luck. We were told that the \"policy\" is that no refunds or replacement tickets are possible, even for bad weather. We pointed out that we had been told that the visibility was good. The Supervisor was then called (by this time a large group of disgruntled visitors had gathered) and she unhelpfully explained that there was nothing she could do about it and that we had all received stamps on our entry tickets showing that there was zero visibility (this was well after we had already paid for them), so basically it was all our own fault. Every single person in the group looked at their tickets and were surprised to see this so-called stamp saying \"zero visibility\". Except that on most peoples' tickets, it was smudged and unreadable. And not a single visitor had been told by the person doing the stamping, or anyone else involved in the process, that there was the slightest issue with visibility (when they clearly knew there was). Yet they were very happy to keep taking everyone's money, and usher them up the lift. This is blatantly deceitful and a complete ripoff. Shame on you, One World Observatory. This is not the legacy you should be leaving on this important building."

It is newly opened to the public on May 29, 2015. My appointed time was 7:30 I was on line definitely more than the recommended 15 minute advised prior arrival time. My group was let in the building at 8pm. The trip through Security was fast and efficient . The only other thing was that you had to jockey a little to get in position to take photos. To those of us who live in the area go in non peak times for tourists."

The views are great and the interactive computer generated displays were very interesting. However, even though we bought tickets for a specific time of day we still had to wait almost two hours to get in and, when we finally did get in, it was way way overcrowded. Maybe in a year or two the demand will taper off and it will be a more enjoyable experience."

I have been to similar observatories in Chicago and London but nothing really compares to this one.There was video presentation that got tears in my eyes being a New Yorker myself. Its an absolute must see.The views...I dont think I have words to describe the views... Its New York and its the tallest building...Ofcourse the views are best in the world... Looking forward to the Staten Island Eye coming up soon...Like all good things come with a bad side sometimes, the only issue I have is the use of strollers.I was asked to fold my stroller in the elevator and the ground floor which I though was unnecessary. They could have just let one less person enter the elevator and enter the next one. Maybe its early days but am sure they will get over the rule of no strollers in the ground floor and elevators."

This new observation area gets everything right -- something the original never did. This needs to be on everyone's To Do list. It took six hours of hitting the refresh button on the browser, but we snagged tickets for the second day. According to the big counter at the entrance, we were something like Visitor 14,567. Reserve well in advance. And plan on eating. There are two restaurants but the steakhouse is sold out for months. The more informal restaurant takes guests on the same day. We put our names on the list and got in an hour later. Prices were high but not outrageous."

            "review": "It's lonely at the top...! . The iconic One World Observatory opened its doors to the public on 29th May, 2015. I was fortunate to visit it before it opened as a part of a school field trip. So can't comment on the booking, ticketing, lines aspect. Neither am I able to comment on the cafeteria or the gift shop. What I can tell you is the awesome experience of the elevator and the views. I think this entire visit is worth it for the experience of the elevator which shows you the 3D timeline of New York city. It's nothing short of fantastic! The elevator takes you to the 102nd floor and you enter a dark room with a screen, which shows you one of the most well-made clippings on New York. Anybody who is a New Yorker will see his life being played out in those 2 minutes, for others it's just a great clipping on New York. What follows after the clipping is over and when the screen goes up is what literally takes your breath away! You have the city of New York unveiled in front of your eyes! Now coming to a critical review of the views - the views are well, great! I have been to the Top of the Rock and I must say that the views from TOTR are more relevant because you can actually see the skyline and the iconic buildings which make New York New York. From the one world observatory - it's great, no doubt, and you can see for miles in all directions, but it's kind of a very lonely view where one is disconnected from the rest of the city. So, if you want to experience the skyline of New York, go to TOTR. If you want to experience cutting edge technology and the One World Observatory, come here! All said and done, I am only reminded of the old adage...it's lonely at the Top!"

The views are truly breathtaking and you always find a space at the window. The elevator rides up and down are kind of virtual reality flights through Manhattan's history (up) and around the tower (down). Some flaws: 1) the windows are very reflective, ie you hardly can take reasonable fotos, 2) at the entrance you have to discard all bottles (guess to increase sales upstairs) 3) the line-up was totally disorganized, maybe a beginners thing (we were among the first 500).At the 101/100 level there are some hosts in video installations that desperately try to get the attention of the audience. Sorry, this is not only not needed, but rather disturbing."

Some aspects are strange, I'll do a separate review of the cafe, which was not good, there also appeared to be some poorly designed spaces, with walkways next to windows, but with screens to stop you enjoying the view, I understand the need for people not to block up the corridor, so why not make the corridor wider? The views make it all worthwhile."

No chairs, no shades and no PA system to announce what ticket time are now being allowed to go inside. 2. When you get inside the observatory, another long queue awaits you for security screening and elevator service. 3. Allot 2-3 hours for this visit. The time in your ticket is not followed, I purchased a 13:45 ticket and was only able to get in the building after an hour and at the observatory past 15:00. 4. Don't purchase your ticket in advance, bad weather means depressing view.5. When Riding the elevator, you should be the last one to get in so you can enjoy the 60 second presentation."

            "review": "AMAZING!!. We were visiting New York for our second visit. We found that this was due to open today and purchased tickets yesterday. You are given an allotted time slot. Upon our arrival, the mass crowds had gathered!! The cost was US$32 each. We were told that the opening ceremony has taken longer than expected, putting everyone back an hour.Our wait was worth it. We went through airport style security. You are NOT permitted to take in food and drink. You walk a corridor, and eventually get to a number of lifts. The ride takes just 60 seconds. You hardly notice it moving. You go through to short show, with a suprise, amazing. You then go through to an area, which leads you down to the viewing deck..... And the views were fabulous. Totally different from Empire State and Rockefeller Centre. (Which we'd done) you can walk round and listen to the City Pulse talk, an interesting and informative visual commentary. There is a restaurant, which we didn't use. The cafe was busy, of course. There was a wide choice of foods, pizza, salads, sandwiches and cakes and drinks. A regular coffee and cake was $9 in total...... Yep, I would say expensive.The gift shop, the usual items with One World advertising. Again prices were high. If things had been more reasonable we might have spent a but more than we did.Well worth a visit, great view of the lower end of New York. I'm sure it'll be busy as its newly opened. You can buy tickets on line, or at the location. "

It was a roller coaster of a journey from bottom to top and down again. Go on a clear day and the views are breathtaking, I could see the curvature of the Earth and it was like looking down from a plane, in fact you are so high almost on past with the helicopters buzzing around City.Great views up the Hudson and East River and all the bridges, superb views across to Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and up town. Even the Empire State Building looked small. Tip - buy ticket on line in advance, even if you can't access your smart phone they will print ticket at the box office. It took full hour from queuing to get in to actually getting into lifts which wizz in 16 seconds 100 floors up. There are no toilets in the queue so if you need to go, find a loo before going through airport style security. To get a full appreciation of the importance of this Tower to Americans, visit the 9-11 museum first. It sets everything in perspective. Again, to avoid queuing, book tickets for museum entrance first. A must see on any visit to New York."

After you arrive at the 100th floor you get ushered into a room with the windows covered up by lots of different shape screens. You watch a 5 or so minute video of new york tgen all of a sudden the screens rise to show your first view of NYC everyone cheered and clapped. You then walk into one of the 3 floors. You can not believe how bright and modern it is. They have a bar and a snack cafe but for those who wish they have a premium restaunt. The gift shop is expensive but it doesn't stop them having big queues. The views are out of this world. I was lucky enough to go up the original tower but i think NYC should be very proud of a beautiful tower after such a terrible attrosity. "

The tickets are timed but there seemed to be no plan for how to handle a crowd. Very long wait outside, slow moving lines inside. We were in line for over an hour after arriving ahead of our appointed time. This was the first day the observatory was open to the public, so I am hoping they learn from the first day and improve the experience. For now, I would recommend the Empire State Building as the better experience."

            "review": "My New Favourite Tourist Attraction in NYC. This will be my new number 1 recommendation for friends and family visiting NYC.It's an incredible experience from start to finish. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive about going here...the fact that this was the last view so many people saw all those years ago is so sad, and I thought it would be difficult to overlook that. But from the minute you begin your journey to the top, you can't help but think of what a strong and poignant symbol of hope this building is. The whole experience here leaves you with an incredible appreciation for the present and future of NYC. I don't want to ruin anything here, because you really should have the experience as they intended it...but I'll just say the lead up to the observatory itself was magnificent. So well thought out and so well executed. The views are obviously stunning...though, in my opinion....I still prefer the views from Top Of The Rock because it has a great close up of the Empire State Building, Central Park and then as far downtown as WTC and Statue of Liberty. Plus, Top of the Rock has outdoor viewing which makes for great pictures (without glass or wire). Having said that, the complete end to end experience at WTC completely trumps any other observation deck I've ever been to. The discovery level was also really great, found out a few interesting tidbits about NYC that I didn't actually know, which was very cool. Also a cafe and restaurant here....I didn't check it out, but I'm sure there is quite the premium to eat on top of the world. Staff here are also incredibly friendly and welcoming - hopefully this cheerfulness and professionalism lasts as staff eventually turnover. I really hope they keep up the amazing experience here...it's like no other attraction in the city and should be an example for all the other time wearied attractions that haven't changed since the 90's...pick up your game!"

If visiting NYC this must be on your, 'to do list!' The views are just breathtaking, I can say no more than that. A lovely fast food cafe (healthy foods being served ) we sat in the adjoining restaurant for lunch where sipping wine eating excellent food and still taking in the views. Every member of staff we came across were all excellent ! Overall a fantastic attraction for NY but we must not forget the reason it is there . I hope all visitors enjoy it as much as we did but take time to think of all the people who lost their lives so tragically on 9/11"

The food is pathetic, muffins, $5.00 water, then a restaurant and bar right next to it. Windows on the World was a fancy place, this is a dump. The company Legends, who is running it does not care about survivors just the money aspect, they can\u2019t even answer simple emails. I have watched this new building being built from the days of the pit to 104 stories and am very disappointed in the company Legends and what I saw up there. Save your money and go to the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock."
