There is a great selection of food from traditional Portuguese to sushi and pizza.The first time we just had a drink and a stroll, we had two coffees and had a go at the pour your own super bock! The coffee was fabulous, smooth and delicious and the beer was an IPA and tasted great. On our second visit we had a Brazilian style pork sandwich and a bowl of stone soup both were very tasty. Time your visits right as it can get very busy."

This is an adventurous reimagining of the traditional City centre produce market into a stunning new venue which still provides a produce market alongside a huge communal eating hall dedicated to restaurants and gourmet produce.30+ food outlets clustered around the outside of the building - several of the restaurants on the west side serving into street cafe's outside and the others serving into the large central food court.You can order your food from any of the hot food outlets (real adventurous cooking here) take your alarm gadget to a table and wait for your choice to be individually cooked. The gadget flashes and rings and you take it and collect your meal, your wine etc and return to the long benches to share your meal in the company of gourmands from around the world.We tried a prawn, chilli and ginger starter with locally baked bread with a green wine from the north of Portugal - outstanding and then two more dishes from a different stall/restaurant; a black rice risotto with scallops and seaweed and a salmon, avocado, chilli and onion dish all delicious with a glass of a local red wine.Our dinner conversations with a French trio and a Polish economics professor.Range of food from contemporary Portuguese, Asian fusion to hamburgers and pizza (both with a twist) wonderful fresh ingredient as well as the customary Portuguese sweet range and ice creams.Souvenir and craft shops complete the picture for this must see, taste, feel and experience this exciting venue. A wonderful example of what the Granger Market in Newcastle could become."

You can find some authentic and orignal stuff, but the real life and real food is just around the market, outside, where you'll find some good, old-fashiones local bistros, for much less money. And generous portions, and you can eat together with local people, or even witht the staff. Very friendly people and good qualtiy food. My advise your be \"Casa CID\", a fantastic place where time is stopped..."

Time out Market made it easy for us to find something we both wanted to eat. It was fun walking around and checking out all of the stalls before we decided.

Don't forget to taste some \"panini\" with ham or get some particular wine in the appropriate \"loja\". Ah, looking for some gadget or souvenir? There you can find it!"

On that particular day it was my Canadian Thanksgiving, so it was such a great experience to be able to share a 'communal' meal with those around me.This is a fantastic market where you will find many different types of cuisines, with food outlets outlining the periphery, and dining areas with communal tables in the centre. I came here several times during my stay in Lisbon, and on each occasion, it was quite packed.I chose to purchase food from several establishments including 'Chicken All Around' where I purchased the Piri Piri Chicken that was quite tasty (but the service was horrible), including a seafood establishment where I ordered a 'marinated salmon with guacamole'; I was expecting a hot salmon dish, although perhaps due to language barriers, I was given a raw salmon ceviche. It was quite tasty, although I was a bit surprised....As mentioned, there are many types of cuisine available as it is more of a tourist destination, so in addition to traditional Portugese cuisine, you will also find sushi, Italian, North American comfort food, and and great international desserts.I would definitely go back!"

Down on the waterfront by all the new tram line building and rail terminus is the old market that is now split as a fruit and flower market and multi vendor food hall.Many of these are popping up around Europe like a Disney style food court. So the Americans have done this style of eating for years but now Europe has it and beer to boot.Great idea with many many food stalls around the room, so you pick your style of food and or drinks and take a bleeping alarm depending on the stall and then find a seat on the long Beer Keller style tables. Then when your food is ready off you go and collect it, eat and be merry.Even on a weekday lunchtime it was busy and in the evening it is very lively and social. No fixed demographic we sat with one couple in their 20's on the left and a group of 9 all in their 70's on the other side, all having a great time.Nice social way to relax for an hour before hitting the City of Lisbon again. Highly recommend it. Try in the day if your nervous in crowds to get the idea then you have to try an evening session."

The location is really not next to...anything. It looks closer than you would think on the maps and in the hot sun a walk is not a good idea. The only place where you might connect here naturally is if you want to come down the Ascencor de Bica from the Chiado area. If not then get a taxi / tuk-tuk as the walk along the waterfront is not the nice picturesque stroll you might imagine.The Time Out food area is next to the real fruit market and a park. A group of excellent restaurants have been invited to build stalls here. The range is truly incredible and the food to a very high standard. You have two options - sit in the middle and each stand in a queue (great if you can't agree)...but the wait can be rather long as each meal is cooked from scratch. Possibly more relaxing is to pick one venue and sit on the seats at the back of each.As you might expect - it was packed.Just go...and if Time Out haven't built 5 more of these I'll be stunned."

Operating 8am till 11am daily (can up to 2am during weekends), we who stayed Lisbon for 4 nights and can't help ourselves to visit there at least once a day! Morning like 9am is lesser crowd whereby there are more people after 3pm all the way till night, it is a warehouse style canteen hence the ventilation is good and spacious at the same time.Try the Balcahau (salted cod fish) at SEA ME, one of the local dishes in Portugal, wine & proscuitto (dried meat) is good for night snack, fish soup and stone soup are good for a warm breakfast. Tea time? Nata (Portuguese tart) is a brilliant choice. Souvenir such as wine, canned fish and handcraft item are available in the market as well. Wide range of drinks kiosks are available in the middle of the market, from coffee to beer, cocktail and ginja (cherry liquor), all in good flavors!Have your good food, enjoy the people watching and take in the vibe :)"

Can you imagine our surprise, when we wandering around Lisbon in our last day in Lisbon is search for the last lunch in that amazing city we came across the place. It is superb location, since it houses so many different dining places under one roof. There is also a market, where you can find fresh fruits and vegetables. Anyway, we found it hard to pick where to order food. All the places seemed really good. I believe it will satisfy any taste. Of course it is not the place to eat in the romantic atmosphere. You order the food, get the buzzer and just find a spot by a big table. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the place, we ordered food from. We had cod fish with hummus and spare ribs. I would definitely recommend the place to people who want to discover different colours of Portuguese cuisine. But if you like to dine in the quite restaurant, you better pick another place. Enjoy."

Love the idea of bringing together so many great restaurants and vendors. There are expensive options and cheaper ones, so great for all budgets. Here are my recommendations:Sea Me: We easily dropped 40euro here and there was 1 standout dish - the cod on spinach. It was fresh and well seasoned. The gazpacho wasn't great. The tuna tartar didn't have enough citrus, in my opinion... and the scallops with corn were delicious, but we only got 3 for 8euro. So, not the best of values - but not terrible.Croqueteria: from the main entrance, it's located on the back right hand corner. This place provided the best value, taste and it was really simple. Highly recommend the Game meat croquette!Creme De La Creme: This is a soup place located on the right hand side next to the test kitchen. I am a huge lover of soups, and this is one of the cheaper food options at 4euro a bowl. I missed this place the first time I visited, and I kept thinking about how I needed to try out their caldo verde... seriously couldn't have been more disappointed. It was really flavorless, lacked proper seasoning and just tasted like I was eating watered down chicken broth. This soup made me angry. Overall, we weren't able to find an \"amazing\" dish or vendor that blew our minds here... but it was still a fun experience and I'd return a 3rd time to sample other places."

And also those that want to try something more local and new instead of the same stuff you'll get at home. Lighting is dark. So you are better off Instagramming your food for lunch if that is important to you."

Would highly recommend trying the Alexandre Silva kitchen as it was brilliant - we had 2 starters (sweet peppers and bread with cheese), 2 mains (seared tuna steak which was fabulous, and an incredibly tasty duck confit) as well as drinks for about 50 euros. The food was delicious and the service fast and friendly. We also tried Asian Lab... That was a decidedly more underwhelming experience. Service was slow, the staff were rude and seemed confused. The pad thai was good but the penang curry left a lot to be desired! I would avoid it as there are better options. Cinco has a fab cocktail menu at good prices, so give that a whirl as well."

This amazing place ( why aren't there dozens of places like this around the world???) is located in the old mercado or market of Lisbon by the waterfront a short jaunt away from downtown. It is now home to a smaller vegetable and fish/meat/dairy market that surrounds a central area where dozens of Lisbons top restaurants, bars and fine food stores have small versions of their main locations. We first visited the TimeOut Lisbon Mercado early one Sunday evening. This is a time when foreign tourists often get caught out - since there are few restaurants open beyond about 4 pm on Sundays in Spain and Portugal. But the mercado with its dozens of small but ample kitchens was buzzing with activity. In fact it never seems to really slow down at any time ... on subsequent visits it was always full of hungry folks, both local and foreign. The food that we tasted was delicious and well-presented, and while some of the kitchens have a few stools at the counter, mostly you just take your food to one of the many long tables in the center of the hall, and join with the rest of the world there. Lots of opportunities to meet people, both locals and tourists. Our dishes would often come from different restaurants, according to our personal preferences, which meant that everyone got to eat what they really wanted. Result : happy campers! I repeat - why aren't there more places like this around the world? Its an idea whose time has come."

There is a traditional market on right side selling meat, fish and flowers and the modern Time Out Market is on the left.It is like foodie heaven when you walk in, small outlets/restaurants all around the outside with tables in the middle. There is something for everyone, from traditional Portuguese to Italian and Oriental. You order your food at your chosen outlet and are given a little buzzer. You go find a seat and collect your food when your buzzer goes off. It looked busy on arrival but there were plenty of seats once you walked around. There were stands selling beer, wine and cocktails amongst the seats.Because we only had the day in Lisboa, I kind of wish I had tried some more traditional food in the winding Lisboan streets.

A minute walk u will find many popular restaurants are here, free seating with many variety of foods, beverage and WC (free). Open from Thursday to Saturday 10.00 to 02.00, Sunday to Wednesday 10.00 to 00.00. If u wish to try many different type of dishes, or dine with a bunch of friends, here is a good place. Some people comment pricy, I would say u can't compare with street foods because some of the stores are cooking with famous chef and a proper restaurant, only different is you can't dine in a proper restaurants feel and romantic atmosphere but the whole environment is not bad. Worth trying!"

Visited for a dink in the afternoon which was fairly busy, then returned for dinner. A great place if you're in a group and want to have different types of food and drinks. The place was buzzing in the evening. It's totally worth having a good walk around to decide what you want to eat before hunting down a place to sit. You may have to go in shifts to get your meals as your spot at the table will go in seconds. Although this seems to be a tourist hot spot, the value for money and quality of the food produced was great. I'm sure you get great food from all the stands, but I highly recommend Asian Lab. Well worth a visit if you're having one of those evenings where you can't be bothered choosing a restaurant for the evening."

I did a circuit and then went back to to a place for a salad (not massive) mango, avocado, salmon roe and a raw fish whose name escapes me plus a glass of blanc de blanc (E5) all in total was E9.5.I wandered on and bought a custard doughnut (massive and E1.5). Communal eating in shared tables (low and high). Great quality, variety and good prices (not cheap but not expensive).I'd love to stay nearby to eat every meal there."

You have to order at the counter of your chosen restaurant/food type and then eat at communal (small and large) tables in the centre. There's a few touristy stores too.All creating a noisy and chaotic experience! There's a very good and proper restaurant on the first floor - Pap'acorda ! Check it out!"

You can choose from 20 or so good quality food outlets catering for all tastes but at busy times like ours the one holding the seats can be alone for extended periods while the other is queueing to order.The more you diversify the choice the longer the ordering process. Some outlets give you a buzzer to let you know when the food is ready but others expect you to wait.We got starters first , identified main courses then found seating.I had a bad experience , twice, at Sea Me , a rated seafood stand where a young staffer lacked basic server skills when he completely ignored me when I tried to buy wine ( he started cashing up the till in front of me, which took ages, and not once did he look up and acknowledge my presence) and again later when I wanted food. He clearly did not 'see me' on either occasion! But our other food experience was good despite queues at popular stalls. Food was a little pricey but very good quality.Very popular with larger groups ( couples tend to get estranged as mentioned earlier!) and young set, it is to be experienced at least once.At some stalls you can sit at the counter at the back, so it is worth a good look round before finalising choices."

Yesterday, we were in Cais Sodre on a search for crepes and were headed to a nearby french restaurant when we stumbled upon this place. We found crepes and so much more. The food options are plentiful, which made it hard to decide on a lunch spot. There is a chef's table in the market which would allow you to sample a food from a few different stalls, but we settled on chow mein at an Asian spot (forgot the name), with fresh squeezed juice from the juice bar, followed by crepes from the ice cream shop. We left full and happy without breaking the bank. Recommend."

This is a welcome addition to the Lisbon eating scene, offering a buzzy street-food vibe to a beautiful old market building by the railway station do sodre. It's a vast room with high, vaulted ceilings with long, high tables running the length of the space. Around the perimeter are perhaps fifty pop-up restaurants offering everything from Asian food to Ceviche fish dishes. We chose Confraria, selling the best, juicy and messy burgers with fries and a beer. You may need hosing down afterwards, but great flavours at a reasonable price. There's several bars dotted about specialising in wine; beer, gin and Lisbon's famous ginja \u2013 a sticky cherry brandy. Atmosphere is great and the seating encourages conversation. Great place for a quick bite and engaging environment \u2013 recommended."

What a lovely surprise to enter the food hall. We ate here 3 times and loved each meal. Good quality food. My favourite meal was at Cozinha da Felicida - just wonderful. It's handy that you can get a good meal here at anytime of the day when a lot of the other restaurants were closed. We ate around 6pm - before it gets very busy apparently. It's easy to get to - we walked from Praco do Comercial, just 10 minutes or so."

Although this wasn't as \"local\" as some of the other places we'd been, I'd still recommend it to get your bearings and plan some of your visit to Lisbon.

We walked around each one to make our decision and ended up headed back to the one of the first we saw where we enjoyed a meal of Veal Rice and the chefs special of basil risotto with prawn tempura. The food was ready within 10 minutes of ordering and we were given a vibrating buzzer to alert us when it was ready. Although it was a expensive given the setting the portions were large and the food was good. Advice is definitely to take the time to wander around and see what is on offer, and look at what others are having... This preventing me from ordering a very overpriced traditional beef dish! A good experience and a fun way to spend an evening."

The most famous places from the city have been invited to open here to make a 'curated' food venue. They charge more money than they do at their other locations in the city. The choices are not exciting, the prices are too high and the building is too hot. I would much rather go to an actual market where some old ladies are cooking up the good stuff."

Additionally there were great wine, beer and cocktails available so is a great place to try many different dishes.

Fant\u00e1stico idea!It houses very good restaurante and gourmet atores. Either you like wine, beer, water, coffee, bakeries, food, sweets... You are at home. A little bit noisy during the day, perfect your is at Sunset and beyond. During the morning you also may experiente a little of old days as the vegetables and fruit marketing still works. And at night try the \"Pap'Acorda' restaurante. Fashion, exclusive, pricey, \"go to see and be seen\", but marvellous food and drink. Book always beforehand. \"Ribeira market\" (previous denomination and how Lisboetas still know it) at its best!"

You pay more for the juice smoothies and the coffees but all was very high quality. It's so easy to navigate.

The fares offered are upscale meats, seafood, coldcuts, sandwiches, desserts, wine, etc. The prices are certainly not low but you still pay less than in a restaurant for probably the same dishes.

The market is packed with places to eat full meals or try lots of small plates, would definitely recommend the latter. All the food I had was incredible and I love the fact they put on classes, have open kitchens to watch the chefs cook and placks explaining why individual restaurants/chefs were choosen to be included and other information.Fantastic! A must visit for any foodie!"

The food, restaurants, and stalls looked solid to us, and we might have come back had we had time. It is not a traditional market where people are selling fish and vegetables. It is prepared food.My wife and I also had a brief discussion about the potential conflict that arises when a travel book company opens a facility that competes with other restaurants and venues. The market appears to be very successful, so it would not surprise me if we saw more Timeout venues in other cities, which does pose issues."

We had taken a Backstreet Lisbon food tour and first we strolled through the market side and then opted to eat our lunch in this market as opposed to a restaurant. We each ordered from a different food stall and shared our selections. Everything was gourmet and wonderful. Earlier we had watched our chef select an enormous tuna from the fishmarket and we tasted it as he made it into tuna tartar. The pork belly was amazing as were the cheeses and desserts. The only problem is that it is extremely crowded with locals and tourists at lunch and finding a place to sit can be very challenging. It is definitely worth a trip."

Felt like being back home in Copenhagen with these obscene prices. Ordered fried calamari, a personal favorite, and it tastes good - but certainly not worth 9 euros for 8 little rings. Unless you just won the lottery, I wouldn't recommend this place. It's such a tease with all the yummy food, that I'm guessing most people can't afford - at least not enough to buy a full meal."

It was very difficult to find a seating for a group in the same area. Food took a while based on expectations given the environment. Our group of 14 ate from 5 different places. The overall feedback was the food was good but not great. There is definitely a huge variety there. One could eat a a different restaurant daily for a month!"

This large gourmet food court with an adjacent market reminds me of Whole foods market here in the states but jammed packed with renowned restaurants. This is great for someone likes me who keeps a list of recommended places to eat but with no time to visit them all. After browsing for about 15mn, I decided to go to SeaMe-Peixaria Moderna. I had their sardine sushi (sardinhas niguiri) and codfish sushi (Bacalhau niguiri) along with a refreshing glass of rose. That food was melt in your mouth delicious! Only regret was not getting more of the sardines. They were definitely my favorite dish. I love that it wasn't just tourists there, lots of locals frequent this place as well while on their lunch break. This reminds me, it's hard to secure or keep your seat during lunch hours. In our group of 3, 2 of us split up to wait in line while one person held down our seats. Quick tip, after talking to some locals, i learned that the best places here are the ones all the way in the back, featuring the Chef's name.Great easy wifi."

From traditional Portuguese dishes, charcuterie, cheese and amazing seafood, to pasteis de nata, gelato and other amazing desserts. Some of the pop-up restaurants are run by well-known Portuguese chefs.You can also buy hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza and Asian food but my recommendation would be to try some of the amazing local seafood. We had grilled octopus with potato & spinach, sardines & tomato on bread and grilled prawns with seafood rice. It was so good we might go back again! Food is freshly-cooked and reasonably priced. Make sure you get there by about 7:30pm because seats are hard to find after that!"

However you must do it early because the market closes at 2pm. Apparently it is open very early however, I think they said 4am. You can get all you need here, produce, fish, eggs, etc.If you don't come for the fresh food you can go to the food court that is always open and get some really nice local dishes, drinks, Vinho Verde, etc. There are also a few crafty shops, wine shops and other little things to take away. This would be a good stop mid day if you are walking around Lisbon in the Bario Alto area."

What's Time Outs policy on retention and introduction? Seems to create a dilemma for them as to be contemporary it has to change with the times.Much better few hours and Euros spent at LxFactory (R.

We arrived early expecting to look over the fresh fruit and vegetables, but that part of the market seems non existent, being used by tables selling old coins, postage stamps, and typical flea market fare.When the food section opened we discovered a whole new side (literally) to the building. Our snack became a grazing session starting with irresistible fresh, enormous oysters at Monte Mar washed down with boutique beer, followed by prosciutto and cheese toasts washed down with a glass of red wine, then a pork roll (disappointing compared to the other myriad of options available), followed by a chocolate eclair (authentic perfection by l'eclair Patisserie Fran\u00e7ais and served with authentic French charm with a glass of sparkling wine. We love local fresh produce markets, but nothing prepared us for this experience of fine dining grazing."

The prices are right for the quality of food you're getting. Also, we didn't have problems finding a place to seat, mostly because we were having late lunch or early dinners. This place reminds me of The Ferry Building in San Francisco, but much bigger, and in my opinion nicer.

Well this really is a treat if you're in Lisbon - Timeout market is a market of 2 halves - the right hand side is a traditional market, lots of fruit and veg on stalls. The left hand side is a renovated warehouse style building with eateries around the outside and a huge number of tall tables and stools in the middle. It's been very cleverly done and I think it's a real asset. If only we had one in Manchester - I think it would go down a storm! We ended up going here twice - the first time we ate lunch. There are lots of seafood places to choose from, some amazing looking food as well as places to get wine, beer, desserts, ice cream. The evening was perhaps even busier so we just grabbed a dessert and then moved on. It was tricky finding space to sit so I'd recommend finding somewhere to sit first and then getting food.It was packed both times - seemingly with tourists and locals. Fab atmosphere. I'd really recommend it."

Good for fun, buzzy group dining if you want to sit at communal high top tables, see/try a range of dishes and are not too fussy about quality. Don't expect staff to be overly friendly - they are under the pump and don't try to hide it. The Time Out advertising sponsorship everywhere obviously doesn't really help to create an authentic atmosphere, and because the market area is completely separate it lacks that bustling vibe. But it's fun and if you want to get chatting to other tourists this is a good place to do it. Word of advice - if you order drinks at the same time as food, ask them to give you them straight away, otherwise you face waiting for your food to be prepared with nothing to drink (easily 15 mins or more)."

Seafood, steaks, down to the best tinned sardines and tuna - they've got something for everyone by some renowned chefs. The best part, the cocktails and beers available here make for a great afternoon meal.Like the mercados in Spain, the idea is very much a communal \"food court\". You pick your food and find a place to sit, which makes for a great if not always comfortable ambiance (for some reason the tables are designed uncomfortably high).

The area where you eat is beautifully decorated and inviting. Large communal tables are used for dining, you cannot book, just find a space. The idea is that you choose your meal and drinks from the outlets that surround these tables, take a seat and then go and collect your order when it is ready. My advice to to wander around and look at all the outlets first to see what is on offer (many have daily specials and plates), then find a seat, then go and order. It is also worth noting that there are restaurants with waiters and tables along the outside edge of the market. These do delicious food served in a more orderly manner. The interior can be very hot, is noisy and crowded. Not a place for a quiet chat over a relaxed dinner. Food is hugely varied and inexpensive. Definitely worth a visit, and the street immediately around the market are worth checking out for more dining and drinking options. The market serves food until late (midnight I think) and opens at 10am."

The added value is the simplicity of not having to make a reservation, the comfort of being surrounded by your peer travelers, and the variety of food offerings.

At some places you can have a meal seating outside, at others you can have a meal seating at the balcony or you can grab a table (or a spot at a large table) in the middle of the place. It is not going to be cheap (unless you just eat a hamburger or something like that) but it is not going to be too expensive and it is going to be worth it.There are specialized wine places, gin places, beer places, cheese places, seafood places, traditional Portuguese food or traditional with a touch of modernity and authentic delicacies from around the country.It is definitely worth a visit."

The Portugese wine selections are varied and top class! My date ordered the amazingly delicious cod risotto which took forever, so we had my octopus salad as a starter, drank vinho verde and munched on potato chips until the risotto was ready 20 minutes later. Not exactly fast food but it was all good. For dessert seek out the Pao do Lo still soggy in the middle eggy sponge cake near opposite the Time Out shop close in the desserts/snacks/sundries section.

I love this market it is thriving with relaxed bustle in a laid back atmosphere .Everyone is someone here and long high tables mix everyone together without deteriorating their privacy . One of you feels like fish , another like bio vegetarian , another juicy meat and a further wants Sushi , well you have come to the right place plus it is delicious . The prices are as reasonable or extravagant as you desire. Definitely go and join the hum buzz as an onlooker a communication thriver . Have a wonderful time."

Firstly, its one of the few (perhaps a dozen) places in old Lisbon where you can have a contemporary meal done in the 21st century, as the standard here is pretty horrible. Theres a good choice and the process is tourist-friendly. The staff is nice too. On the other hand, this joint is somewhat synthetic and corporate and doesnt really tell you much about the city around you. Theres the usual post-modern fusion of various couisines, slighly small portions of modern takes on this and that. The hall is always overcrowded, noisy and it tends to be a problem to find two seats once you order your meal, let alone hear each other. The pace is afterall authentic: it is nearly impossible to eat calmly anywhere in Lisbon. I would suggest going here once you cant eat a poorly prepared bare cod with lettuce any longer, but you dont think you got a local experience while doing so."

It's downfall is the hygiene in the main eating area. As we sat to eat a pigeon flying overhead pooped on the table. Again, as disgusting and shocking as this was it's bound to happen in an open space such as the market. The main issue was the cleaning. One of the cleaners came over and took a used tissue from his bin to wipe the initial poop. He then proceeded to wipe the rest up with his cleaning cloth which he used for the our table and others without any sanitising spray or cleaner. Heaven knows how many tables got wiped with a cloth covered in germs from pigeon poop. Hygiene training highly recommended here."

We went here just for some snacks as it is a 'food market' but were blown away by the choices on offer so we had to come back another day to try more!We went while England were playing in the Euros and I was delighted that they had a big screen up as well showing the action. Loads of choice of drinks as well as the food so be prepared to spend some serious time here."

This place has it all, so I found myself there a couple times during my trip, twice at the hamburger place, pizza place and the fresh juice stand, and off course a few other things around there. There is a sweet place that sells quindin, it's known to me as a Brazilian dessert made with coconut and eggs, this particular shop makes it in different flavors, since I like it so much I had to try all the flavors, my favorites were the traditional of course and the passion fruit was GREAT!!"

It is a upscale place with foods of the world. Amazing hand cut meats which caught our eye. Although pricey again we learned a lot from the staff at the stale.There is also a gift shop selling all things made in Portugal which was neat.Well worth a stop and if you are taking the Hop on Hop off tour, the bus stops right in front of the market on your way back into Lisbon from Belem. Another note is the Ginja shop just outside the market. We really enjoyed the Ginja Sangria and chocolate Ginja shooters:)"

Had bday dinner at Azul, seafood corner on the left of the main hall. They had an outside eating area which is much like alfresco dining anywhere. Had very nice lobster and also recommend the razor clams. Service was very good there. Returned a couple days after the bday and had a less specific experience. It did not disappoint.

My husband and I brought his 12-year old and 14-year old kids with us to Lisbon for a vacation following a conference in Lisbon. We spent a total of 9 days in Portugal and visited Lisbon, Sintra, Cascais and much of the Algarve area. Of all of the places we ate, in all of the regions, in all of the settings, the first thing my stepdaughter said when we returned was how much she wished she could go back to this market, which we visited on the advice of a local Lisbon colleague. I agreed with my stepdaughter completely. The price is seriously right at each stall, and my only regret was that I could not try everything on the trays of strangers sitting around me. Moreover, for impatient diners, this is not the sort of place where dinner lasts hours, unless you linger over beer or wine. I recommend taking a circuit of all of the stalls before deciding. We ordered beverages from one stall, each of us ordered a main from a different stall, and the kids snagged dessert from yet another stall. It was delicious!"

I did my research and found that there are around 30 different food stalls in this market. I went twice on my trip; first out of sheer hunger and the second because of convenience. It is located right across the street from the hub of the Cais do Sodre station. After a gorgeous sea view with sub par coffee in Estoril, I longed for some real coffee. I knew I wouldn't fail here and I didn't! The place was hopping with live folk-rock music on a Tuesday evening. I ordered \"um garoto\" which is an espresso with a dab of milk. Once fueled, I surveyed the display of modernized Portuguese dishes. I ordered octopus rice from Miguel Castro e Silva, which was the Portuguese version of octopus creole (southern Louisiana). The octopus was really tender, flavorful and not chewy!! I topped it off with the sweetest berry-based sangria from Marlene Vieira that ever touched my lips! All of that was 15 euros!! Next time I went was my last night in Lisbon. I was walking along the Tagus from Praca de Comercio, which is a breathtakingly peaceful walk. I figured for the price and the choices I would head back there. I stopped at Conserveira de Lisboa for a pretty wrapped tin of sardines for when my heart sinks missing Lisbon. I wanted more octopus but it seems that every place was out. So I made my selection at Miguel Castro e Silva again. With all the choices this stop was very friendly and service oriented. I had my last bachalau a bras for a while. It wasn't the best but it was dang good. I stopped by a cake place but forget the name but I will never forget the passion fruit pie I ate there. In the end I stopped at Casa da Ginja for a bit of smoother than average ginga before my last sunset for this trip. Go to Time Out!!"

I expected a Portuguese version of Barcelona's Mercado de la Boqueria or London's Borough Market. Unfortunately, when the global Time Out events schedule/lifestyle guide took it over, it created a food court version of its standardized global model. This works for a magazine listing events, it doesn't for a market. Instead of a market or interesting set of food stands, there is a homogenized food court in the now-standard mid-2000s Williamsburg hipster style. There were some places selling Portuguese items, but not that many, and they pretty bland with limited options. My advice is to skip it. There are so many other places in Lisbon that taste better, cost less, and have something of the country that you are visiting in them."

Apparently a few of the outlets are from extremely well known chefs. It is enormously popular and the waiting time for lunches were around 25-30 minutes. Seating on the long benches waiting for your machine to light up to tell you your meal was ready is a real pain, especially when they serve your drink at the same time. However there are outlets serving spirits, cocktails, wines and soft drinks separately, so perhaps they are the answer! Food was fine, not especially inexpensive but the place has a buzz that could appeal to many."

We were told that all the amazing chefs in Lisbon who have their own restaurants have a stall here to sell their amazing food in smaller portions and less expensive. There are stalls that line 3 of the 4 sides of the room so there are plenty of options! We went here twice actually. My recommendation is to walk around and decide where you want to eat. Then if you are traveling with someone else, choose who will stay in line to order and who will go find seats. This markey gets VERY crowded and it can be quite difficult to find a seat (especially if you are traveling in a group)."

The old iron framework with its high ceiling has been cleaned up and is the home to 35 restaurant stalls, each with its own point of view. Many of the stalls are chef- inspired takes on different cuisines with a Portuguese slant.The seating is first come, first seated and you must stand in line to order, then wait. When the food is ready, however, it is very good. I ordered a roasted suckling pig sandwich with cracklings and chips for E9.50. The guys had pork cheeks over pureed potatoes with brown reduction for E10 and an octopus salad for E8.50. Beer and wine are available and there is no tipping. There is also everything from Asian to Pizza and more.Be tolerant of crowds and watch your pockets. This is a one time visit unless you favor a hectic meal. There are a number of crafts and chochkie shops. All in all, a worthwhile place to see. Part of the market still functions as a supplier to restaurants. The project is 2 years old and appears to be growing.chef"

The food and wine available from these little independent stalls is amazing and extremely well priced.I can't remember the name of the stall but it's important to grab yourself at least one of the duck croquettes because they are incredible. I was discussing with my partner what we were going to eat from the stall when we saw the duck things and a local woman queuing behind us overheard our discussion. She was queuing to buy 10 of them because she thought they were that good. So that was it......SOLD! And they were amazing!! To find them.....With your back to the ladies toilets go to the left side of the stalls. Keep walking past about 5/6 stalls and there's an option to turn left. The stall on this junction is the one you need!The only bad thing about this place is that there is not near enough seating. We wandered around for 15 mins before asking a fellow English couple if we could use the end of their table to put our wine down whilst we stood up to eat!So my advice is try and get a seat before getting your food (we went on a Saturday so it's possible it might be less busy in the week)."

Generally speaking it's hard to have bad food here and worth going if you want to sample bits and pieces before deciding on what type of restaurant you want to have dinner in that night.It's right opposite the train station so very easy to get to but it's difficult for a place like this to have any sort of proper atmosphere when it's that vast. I would have loved to have done a proper shop through the farmers' market bit of it and brought home some raw ingredients to cook. This is also offered by some of the stalls in the main arena and might be worth looking into if you have the chance to do some self catering while in the city."

However, the people working there are fast and efficient in getting the punters through, so we didn't have to wait long to be served. There's a decent selection of options, although seafood/fish dominates slightly. The arrangement is that you buy your food and then find somewhere to site at one of the long tables ranged through the middle of the market. If you order hot food, you'll be given a disc which lights up when the order is ready. While waiting, you have the challenge of trying to find seats - be patient because that can involve quite a bit of walking up and down the rows. The market itself is not east to spot from the road. We had walked along the river bank from the east and then into the station (Cais do Sodre). The market is across the road and about 30 metres to the left."

Surrounding all of the seating are a multitude of restaurants with anything you can imagine. They have traditional Portuguese cuisine at many of the restaurants, lots of seafood, Asian cuisine, pizza, gelato, desserts, and much more! Everything is delicious but you do pay for it. Compared to what you would get at a restaurant along the streets in Lisboa, Time Out Market is a bit pricey, but it is a tourist attraction so they can raise their prices because people still go. I like to go once in a while when I have a guest visiting because they always love all the options and the bustling atmosphere. Definitely give it a try or at least a walkthrough when in Lisbon!"

Soup was ok and the cod dish was nice. Well cooked with a satisfying cream sauce. Biggest issue is seating. If you get your food from a stall which does not have its own seating, but relies on you finding a seat in the communal seating area, then you could be looking around a long time for a free seat if it's very busy. And you may not find one at all (this was my experience)."

Make sure you get there early - we struggled a bit to find a place to sit and to be honest no one seemed sympathetic enough to offer seats to a 'single' mum with three young children. In fact an older couple slipped in and took our places while I tried to get the children's coats off so they could sit down. At any rate, the burgers were collected and the children gobbled them down. Overall really neat place to eat, with loads of selections for food, and a great community feel."

All fresh food, freshly cooked, in dozens of different styles and accompanied by whatever you wish - wine, beer, fruit drinks, ginja (wild cherry liqueur) etc. Both Portugese specialities and international dishes like sushi are available, salads to steaks, Alentejo ham, fish and seafood, veggies, local desserts & ice creams etc. An astonishing selection. You order at one or more vendors' stalls, and either take your food or first an electronic pager to be paged when its ready, to a high stool on one of the long communal tables. You could eat here every day for years without repeating your choice. Our selection was very good salads but hot food is as available as cold. The place was very full when we visited, with both locals on their lunches and tourists, but a little swapping stools about was going on everywhere to get groups and couple their seats together, all very good natured.

We went just before 12 so managed to find a seat easily but some of the stalls weren't quite ready to serve so we sat and enjoyed a lovely fruity sangria first. We chose several things from the top end/more Portuguese stalls and really loved it. They were very tasty and reasonably priced for what we had. Afterwards we saw that on the outer walkway quite a few of the stalls had a few bar seats on the other side where you could order and sit slightly more quietly and not all these were taken.

Everything on the menu was very tempting, but I heard Henrique S\u00e1 Pessoa was the best place to get some pork dishes, so we ordered the crispy skin suckling pig sandwich with homemade pickles and the 24h confit suckling pig with sweet potato pur\u00e9e. We were not disappointed by any of our dishes. The pig was cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed the 24h confit, which was very moist and the crackling thin and crispy. The sweet potato pur\u00e9e was nice and smooth with a hint of orange which gave a bit of acidity to the dish. The only thing I didn't like about this market was the lack of space to sit down at rush hour. People were taking their seat before ordering their food, which was a issue when you had your food and couldn't find a seat to eat it."

Great location near the metro station and within walking distance of the center of town. Taxis available outside as well if you want to use as transportation. Besides restaurants, they have desert shops, wine stores, cocktail bars, wine bars, beer bars and gift type shops.Great concept and highly recommend it at least once on your visit. The perimeter is all food vendors and you order like fast food style, but the food is restaurant grade. They typically give you a pager and when your food is ready, you come back and pick up. The only downside is finding a table to eat at. Think of the food court at a shopping mall. Best to find a seat first if you are party of two or more. They send one or two at a time to order. Just have someone guard your seats while doing this. Some of the outer restaurants have their own seating outside or along a bar which is nice. Overall a great experience and recommend it."

Each stall uses a pager system so you order, pay and take away a buzzer which flashes when your food is ready. It can mean that your group are not all eating at exactly the same time but generally the food is ready within 5mins no matter where you order from. Quality of the food was excellent and very fresh. We all really enjoyed our dishes although prices varied - we paid the same price (9 euros) for a small dish of tuna ceviche as we did for a whole chicken!

Tip: order starters from one place, main course from another... Share portions between friends... This way you can taste a lot of different things and the sometimes long waiting times for your food won't matter."

When I got there, all the produce stalls were closed, which was obviously a bit of a let-down. The central food-stall area was INSANELY busy, even on a weekday. Lots of the food smelled good but it was difficult to choose because getting a good look at any of the dishes was tricky and not everything had a price listed.I settled on a dish which was so-so and a beer which was more than the going price at smaller cafes. Overall, this would be a fine place to stop if you were starving and needed a quick bite, but I would definitely not have gone out of my way to stop in."

As I have said in the preamble if you expect that this will be a full on La Boqueria (Barcelona) experience you may well be disappointed. Mercado da Ribeira! has its own charm and has given itself over to some major evolution and what a pleasant surprise it is. As you approach the Market building which is located close to the sea front/docks area of central Lisbon, nothing will prepare you for what the city has created here. In one of the two major market halls you will find a traditional local produce market that has remained largely unchanged for a century or more but in the adjoining Hall you will be amazed to find a tastefully modern food Hall that manages to blend seamlessly into the fabric of this historic building, whilst managing to tap into its personality and the ambience of its history.The variety and quality of the food is quite exceptional for the most part; we tried a platter of cured meats(including Black Pig) Breads and delicious local cheeses all washed down with a Douro Valley red.Others in our group raved about the outlet selling a bewildering variety of Tartar dishes two of which I got to sample and they were superb.The differing cuisine's on offer here are too numerous to mention but I seriously doubt that anyone would fail to find something to delight there taste buds whether it be seafood, pasta, Asian, local, Mediterranean etc.The ambience is relaxed with music playing in the background The design is people friendly with the majority of outlets being around the outside of a large inner seating and standing area. There is ample room to sit and relax and enjoy the surroundings and the food.We stayed for about 2 hours before travelling on to the airport. Originally this was to be a way of killing time without being hemmed in at the airport but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable stimulating experience that enhanced my whole stay in the greater Lisbon area.When I return to this beautiful city next, I will be making my way on more than one occasion to this unexpected and charming market."

The old produce market has a large central hall, where fish and vegetables were sold. Now this central hall has communal tables, bar stands in the centre, and multiple restaurants around the outside of the central hall. One can order different courses from a wide variety of different restaurants, and bring them to one's eating place. It is a brilliant marketing concept, as one is not tied to a single restaurant, and the restaurants are forced to compete in one space, with their prices on display to every other restaurant. In the side-galleries there are some restaurants where one sits on bar stools, and orders from that restaurant. We tried several suppliers and were pleased with the quality and price. The only exception that I would make is that for a wine-producing country, the wine prices, at E4.50/glass are high. The only downside is that it gets crowded very quickly, and it then becomes difficult to find seating. Best place in Lisbon for people-watching."

All of the pictures and the concept seemed very cool- much like the group of food trucks that will gather in different cities. Many food choices all under the same roof. At first all the food looked delicious, and tasted delicious... Then 7 hours after eating at Miguel E Castro Silva's booth that all changed. I was throwing up in the allies of barrio alto and we had to leave a fado show early because my stomach was in full on attack mode. I am still sick from the food at the market yesterday and it has ruined our day today. There must be some issue with the food storage at the market because each booth is so small and I'm not the only one to have this reaction to the food here. Choose something basic when you visit this market. It's a cool place but not worth losing the next day over due to a very long sickness."

Was in Lisbon for a 4-day conference, and the two dinners I had were both very good and authentic.My spouse went on a dinner tour the night before and suggested we go to Time Out since it was recommended by another acquaintance she met on that tour. I'm glad to have visited as the food was excellent, the price was reasonable, and it was unlike other 'food emporiums' that you might find in Farmers Markets in the US, such as The Grove in Los Angeles, Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia, or (yuck) the Lexington Market in Baltimore. This place is much more upscale!Yes you have some 20 or so vendors of all kinds of food, from sushi to hamburgers to pizza to classic Portuguese dishes, arranged all around a giant open space with long bar-height tables. You get a buzzer for when your food is ready, you get a tray with real plates and silverware. (I noticed all the plates were standard sizes, easing the mechanics of clean-up and distribution of the tableware.)In the center is a bar area where drinks could be ordered - as others have mentioned a bit overpriced at 5-6 Euros. Great choice if you were traveling as a family; as a couple we really enjoyed both the meal (try the roasted, salted peppers, they are great, and had some great pork loin), and the atmosphere (at 8pm on a weeknight in April it was full, it took some patience to find a seat). Open till Midnight Sun-Wed, open until 2am Thurs-Sat!Hmm, if I had the 'munchies' at midnight this would be an awesome choice."

Think the bar tenders put a tourist tax on it at \u20ac6 a glass when even 4 star hotels only charge \u20ac3.50 locally. This lets it down as you feel you have been tourists ripped off.

Having indulged in traditional Portuguese fare for several days, I ordered an \"Ox burger\"...what could go wrong with a burger you may ask? Well, a lot: with this one there was a distinct lack of bun! In other words the beef pat\u00e9, which was rather nice, was stark bollock naked! Now, I'm not an expert on Portuguese culture but I'm pretty sure that burgers in 99.9 % of the world, including Portugal, come in buns, or at least this is the expectation...an expectation propagated for better or for worse by fast food chains such as McDonalds. Now, not only did the poor beef pat\u00e9 have nothing but a lettuce leaf covering it's modesty, but there was also no tomato sauce to keep the rather lonely side order of wedges company...Ronald McDonald would be turning in his grave!"

We had menu of the day from one of the vendors which included a plate of lovely roast beef and potatoes with spinach, a glass of very nice house wine and a pastry sweet sardine for all of 12 euros. Yep you can pay less or more elsewhere but I really enjoyed the atmosphere and it's open all day until the early hours. There's something for most palates. Have been twice already and will probably be back as the octopus dish looked amazing."

On the other is a foodie heaven of a large range of pop-up restaurants. It is a large open space with the walls lined with small restaurant kitchens. In the middle are rows of communal benches to sit and eat at. You order your food from whatever kitchen, and if I a group try various ones, then wait for your electric buzzer to ring to say that your food is ready. Food is consistently good but if for different kitchens will not all be ready at the same time. There are famous chefs represented and they didn't disappoint. In holiday season it is very busy but when we went back in Janaury there was no problem getting a seat. It is similar to San Miguel Madrid but here in Lisboa the focus is more on plates of food where as San Miguelmis more tapas or pinchos. Highly recommended for a group of friends. Easy to find and a short walk from the metro."

Apart from some concessions, serving drinks and snacks the food 'hall' doesn't open until midday when there is a wide choice of different types of foods to be had. Every person in your group can have something different which would suit the carnivore, vegetarian or even vegan diner. The ability to get good wines and beers at different outlets means that you can have as good a confection of a meal as possible to satiate everyone. The communal dining thing is very attractive but, at peak times, you have to hang onto your space so that someone in your party stops your seats from being pilfered whilst you go off to collect food, drinks or go to the loo. A lovely environment with a real buzz at a price that you have ultimate determination over."

Although it's pretty much fast food it has a different approach. Most of the restaurants will offer some local dishes (like soups, ever-present dishes of \"bacalau\" - codfish, so you'll have plenty of choices to go for local specialties), but you will also find a sushi restaurant, pizza cuts, and delicacies such as local ham and local cheeses. You'll also have an opportunity to choose a drink - from freshly squeezed juices or local beer to good wine selection. Perfect spot to make a lunch (or even early dinner) break while you are walking around old city center. It's right there on the river bank (hence the name of the market) alongside Cais Do Sodr train station. Price ranges vary depending on the restaurant - but you can eat tasty food for a very reasonable sum of money. The only downside - it may be crowded on weekend during lunch hours."

The service was pretty quick (especially seeing as we were there during lunchtime), the cleaning staff were super quick at clearing tables.

When I reported it to the security guard, he lit a cigarette and told me to go to the Police station to report it. I contacted the police via phone, sent in a report via email and 5 days later, have STILL not been contacted.* ADDITIONALY, the last time we visited in September 2015, my 28 year old niece was intentionally KICKED by a man who asked her for money while she was in the market hall.* AGAIN, the security guards showed no interest.* So just a heads up folks, its a great place, but keep an eye out for trouble."

The choice is extensive and the food is very good. The prices were reasonable for the quality of the food. We chose a seafood restaurant and enjoyed fresh oysters, clams and prawns. It was wonderful. After lunch, we bought wine from the wine store in the market and learned about the different regions in Portugal. We ended up with several bottles from the Douro region and some excellent port to take home. Overall. we were very impressed with the use of the space and the quality of food available. Saude!"

Tourists make up the vast majority of the patrons, and I think it's because you can get food that's a better and cheaper from most of the local cafes and restaurants that are on every street corner. I spent two weeks in Lisbon, and that was my experience. The food I had was small in portion compared to what I had been getting from local restaurants, and almost twice the price. It's really busy too, and difficult to get a spot to sit. If you are time poor, it's a good place to go to get a lot of variety."

On my first visit unfortunately it was just too busy and crowded and not what I was after on the day; however, I came back and gave it a try on another day and it was a completely different story with plenty of places to choose to sit and barside seats available at the restaurant fronts. We chose a seafood bar and the seafood was fresh and the service was wonderful with the lady taking the time to offer her suggestions of both menu options and pairing wines. The tiger prawns were huge!!A must visit to experience the new modern style of Portuguese city life and cuisine."

We also had amazing beef tartare at the Tartarine. 30 vendors - everybody will find something."

Perfect little spot for lunch especially for foodies. I got oysters for a starter from one place, then I had an amazing octopus dish from another and lastly sushi for dessert and everything was priced very reasonably. I would definitely say you get your moneys worth and that its quite cheap especially for what you get. Highly recommended!"

The ambiance of this covered food hall is second to none. We entered the building by the vegetable market, which in itself is worth a visit. Off to the side of the building is a huge hall which must have about 40 different food vendors situated on the outside edges of it, offering food cuisine from across the globe. In the middle of the hall, is the communal seating area which seats a couple of hundred or more people, I think at a guess! I won't go into what we had to eat, but we used two different vendors and sat in the communal area together and enjoyed an excellent meal, probably one of the best in our Portuguese trip experience. You could quit easily forget the rest of the restaurants in Lisbon and come to this place to eat every day for a month.(Perhaps that's a bit extreme!)Don't leave Lisbon without visiting this venue!"

The pizzas look good, they have slices for 2-3 Euros, and the roast pork was delicious.On the fresh produce/meat side, things are actually cheaper and reasonably priced though!

It was nice to dine and hang out for as long or a little as we liked. At each vendor you order at a counter, and then find your own seat within the crowd. Everything you might want they have - Portuguese meats and cheeses, fish, hamburgers, wine, and other traditional dishes with a modern twist.There were a lot of locals here eating as well as tourists. We ended up chatting with some other visitors for a few hours while enjoying wine. A great place to eat for lunch or dinner in Lisbon!"

This new food court at Mercado da Ribeira \u2013 Lisbon's biggest fresh food market opened in 2014 and I understand has become a firm favourite among the locals as the first permanent foodie venture for Time Out. The market hosts a total of 35 kiosks \u2013 all branded in the same black and white signage selling regional specialities, including Azeit\u00e3o sheep's cheese, plates of ham from the Alentejo, and custard tarts from award-winning cafe Aloma. Tins of sardines in beautiful retro packaging at the Conserveira de Lisboa, wines from Garrafeira Nacional or chocolates from Arc\u00e1dia make great presents to take home. In addition, five top chefs have restaurants here, offering clever dishes playing with Portuguese flavours from \u20ac5 (marinated mackerel with gazpacho at Alexandre Silva). Settle yourself at one of the high wooden benches and it would be very easy to while away a few hours eating your way around Portugal's culinary highlights. The original fish, fruit and vegetable stalls on the other side of the huge 19th century building still sell their wares every day, except Sunday, until lunchtime. Must say though although we found the Super Bock Draft stand a great addition I found the food to be very over priced and quite sub standard to many of the Restaraunts we had dined in other parts of the City So to sum up great for choice but lacking on quality and quantity more like fast food dining than \"top chef\" standard."

It is a former market that now has a series of small restaurants around the interior with the central area reserved in the main for seating to eat whatever takes your fancy. The central area also includes a champagne bar, a Gin bar and others. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Lisbon."

This market, however, is almost exclusively food stalls some related to Lisbon restaurants serving similar food at considerably higher than market prices. No actual market sellers so far as I could see.I had a salmon burger from one stall that was good but our deep fried tempura from another stall was a touch on the greasy side. Wine from the wine stall was lacklustre and the guy selling it couldn't have been less interested in us. A far cry from the excellent but unrelated mercado in Madrid."

Similar concept to Food Republic in Singapore which tries to house some of the most popular local restaurants under one roof, it's a fantastic one stop place to sample some food from Portuguese chefs (unfortunately Jose Avillez is not represented) and other popular brands like Cafe Sao Bento, Sea Me, Honorato burgers, O Prego Da Peixaria - you only need to google some blogs on food recommendations to find these names repeatedly come up.

Very interesting place and easy to get to from central Lisbon - a large hall with high ceilings, modern wooden tables with high or low stools, surrounded on all sides by counters serving different dishes by a variety of chefs. Prawns, suckling pig, pizza, chicken, all cooked to order - you are given a little disc to take to your table, which pings and flashes when your food is ready for you to collect - a fun and practical idea.A huge advantage to eating here rather than at a sit-down restaurant is that each member of your party can choose something from a different stand and then sit and eat together. This is a brilliant place to eat for a family or group of friends all with different tastes.It's quite informal - choose your own seat - and relaxed. No-one rushing you to move on. Unmissable just for the chance to sit and watch what's going on, and to wander around the food kitchens/counters, window-shopping with your eyes and tummies.My daughter had grilled fresh sardine fillets on crusty bread with tiny diced fresh vegetables atop. She loved it. I had warm, deliciously moist and tender suckling pig in a fresh bread roll. Each dish was about 5-6 euros - you could pay up to 10 euros for more luxurious/larger plates of food.We are definitely making this a regular stop when we return to Lisbon later this month!There was also a craft and gift shop within the hall - I did a good deal of Christmas shopping here as the items were unusual and beautiful - flavoured salts, notebooks, chocolate, kitchenware - a well-chosen range and definitely not overpriced - some of the same items were sold in the Alfama shops at a higher price."

The main area is decked out with high stool seating and formidable wooden tables to enjoy the culinary delights of the vendors and there are a number of bars on site as well. Unlike other markets which start early, Mercaso da Ribeira doesn't open till 10am and it stays going till midnight I think (never stayed late enough). The first day I arrived in Lisbon was a Sunday and the streets were relatively quite. I knew of the Mercado so I set out to find it - all quite outside but when you enter its a different world - alive with sellers and buyers, many of whom were here to dine on the delicious offerings. Its busy all day long and well deserves the custom it gets. Its located just opposite the metro and Ferry terminal."

Not only is there food, but you can pick up your bottles of Port there, but canned fish from the Conservaria and buy local goods at la vida portugesa.The food however is quite outstanding - really great gourmet fare all based on the Lisbon theme - this is no mall food court. We ate steak tartare, drank sangria, and watched the locals commune drink and eat.The atmosphere is set up so that you can take a place at a huge communal table and then grab different bites from all of the various vendors. When you order from a vendor, they give you a pager so that you're free to roam or return to your table while your food is prepared - you won't find any chafing dishes here - everything was extremely fresh and prepared to order. It's a great place to go if you have a diverse group that wants to try different things.Highly recommended!"

The octopus rice my friend ordered, was whatery small portion, and not worth the \u20ac14 Monte Mar charged for it.

Apart from being a beautifully restored market building, it also houses a selection of stalls representing some of Lisbon's best restaurants and food providers, selected by Time Out critics. You buy food at the stalls and then eat at central tables and benches. It's very popular as the food is good. Finding a seat at peak times can be difficult but not impossible if you're patient and watchful. We had a great lunch there, ordered from the Cozinha da Felicidade and Pizza a Pezzi stalls. Definitely not street food prices, but the quality was excellent and the experience was fun"

I followed this with some slices of pizza at Pizza a Pezzi. Delicious. After words I had some good drinks of the adult variety that were on offer while I just relaxed for awhile. Later on that day I came back for dinner, since I was still in the area. This time around I Gyoza and Pad Thai from Asian Lab, as well as some more beer.

The first impression is very good with a great building and a large choice of food options. At any popular time the experience wanes with lots of people looking to find a space to sit. For two it is less of a problem than for four, but it's still not easy. People lurk behind anyone who looks like they might be finishing their meal.Having found a space the next challenge is selecting what to eat. The variety might seem a good thing but queuing at several outlets takes time, and the delivery time for food is unreliable. Putting together the combination you are looking for is long winded.For some reason the service is surly and slow, and the food when it arrives is not impressive. I went with real real goodwill and ended up feeling irritated. I enjoyed several tapas bars much more and didn't have to assemble a selection of food and wine over a long period of time.. Worth looking at but not a good dining experience even at lunchtime.If you hit the place at a quiet time and choose your options carefully you could have a pleasant snack in a lively atmosphere and very attractive space. We found a lot of very good tapas and wine bars in Lisbon which were a lot more enjoyable, and for a full meal much better restaurants."

Very creative and fun dishes. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt the food was a great value. Most of the places use local and/or organic ingredients.

We had sushi, pizza, pastries, pork belly, Tempora string beans , mushrooms stuffed with quail eggs, lots of beer ($4.80 for 3 large drafts) oysters, and on and on. The food stalls are all around the perimeter of the giant market, each representing a well known professional chef's work, and in the center there are tables to sit and eat.It's noisy and busy and very casual. We met a couple from Germany and sat for an hour and chatted about travel.There is also a large area with beautiful fresh flowers, but you couldn't eat them so we weren't much interested in them."

This wouldn't be that bad if the culinary quality was great, but the fact is that it is merely average and you do not get to enjoy an interesting atmosphere.

You have wide range of taste and a small shop for handcarafts. However there is a dissappointment about this place. It is like a food court rather than a \"mercado\". If you go to other food markets around the world (in New York, Philadelphia, Montevideo, Tokyo, Paris etc) the place is designed as a labyrinth and you walk around between the shops. This place left the main hall empty and filled it with tables, so it gave me a feeling of a shopping center. The board signs and even the areas that every shop has is are the same so it killed the feeling a little bit. But if you only care about food, you won't be dissappointed."

No, it's not like the food markets in Asia, nor is it cheap per se, but the fact that it's different is what makes it special.With many restaurants closed for a portion of the day, the TimeOut Food Market ensures that you can find great food at any time, into the night. We've visited for lunch (usually late, around 2:30-3:00 PM so as to avoid the crowds) and for late night snacking, and we've never left disappointed. Several popular restaurants have stalls here, including Sea Me & O Prego da Peixaria. There's a good selection of local & traditional Portuguese food. Some restaurants, e.g. Marlene Vieira, have a daily menu which is good value for money. We can recommend the beef steak on Fridays. The Asian Lab serves great food, too, if you'd like something different. Their gyoza was particularly tasty. There are drinks stalls, too, and places where you can buy local products to take away, e.g. olive oil.We've been to the TimeOut Food Market several times and it's been a great experience every time. It may be a little too fancy for a food market, but that's not a criticism in my book. Great food, good location, ample space to sit down and enjoy! We'd be interested to see whether TimeOut decide to implement this idea elsewhere."

Having seen food courts/markets around Asia, as well as Europe (e.g. La Boqueria) I felt sort of the distance at first glance of Time Out. It has a feeling of a well organized machine, with almost no soul in it. It's hard to explain, but somehow this food court lacks a special lively vibe and a bit of chaos. And the way I saw it, it's more like a touristy spot than locals' choice. But the food defends itself pretty well. Lots of vendors to choose from, definitely worth a visit. Foodies will be pleased, but only those with deep pockets. Prices are well above Lisbon's average, including alcohol. My personal recommendations: Tartaria with one of the best tuna tartars I've tried in my life and Cafe de Sao Bento. The latter serving superb beef - try it in a classic Portuguese Prego sandwich or as a grilled entrecote steak - melting in your mouth and leaving you craving for more."

The trouble is, as there is so much choice you cant sample dishes from every stand!A few of the dishes we had were:- Shrimp tempura with curry mayonnaise from Marlene Vieira's stand. Gigantic, meaty prawns in a crisp batter, served with a rich curry mayo.- fried cuttlefish in black tempura from Sea Me; tender, melt in the mouth cuttlefish in a squid inked, crispy batter, served with a sharp vinegar dressing. - Pork cheek from Henrique Sa Pessoa's stand. This was like the best comfort food you could ever wish for, pork cheek that melts in your mouth, with a creamy mashed potato, topped with perfectly cooked cabbage which balances the texture with a little crunch.- The Caf\u00e9 de Sao Bento Filet Mignon. This steak was so tender, we were given butter knives to cut it with. This cream sauce it lies in is incredible; decadent and buttery without being heavy.We also had some delicious desserts. The overall quality of all the food at Mercado da Ribeira is very high, and the equivalent in the UK would probably be at least double the price.I'm absolutely certain that there are 100s of amazing dishes from other stands, but we just didn't have the time to try each restaurant. I would have loved to have tasted some fresh lobster. I definitely need to return!"

We opted for Trincas, a restaurant counter behind the main area. It was intimate and a most welcome shelter from the populous main market. We had a delicious steak (topped with an egg) served with spicy saut\u00e9ed potatoes and a salad. Our host Sebastian provided a guide of the local fare his chef was making.

I wanted something simple, fast and uncompromising. I\u2019m very fond of the national snack called Prego. A thin and tender steak, flavoured with garlic, rare or medium rare. That\u2019s what I had. The lady asked - Homemade Chips? - Curious, I said yes please. - And to drink? - A glass of Red - \u201cTinto do Prego\u201d.

Best experience was in outer ring at a small seafood bar whetre good shrimp scampi and wine with pleasant barkeep was $13. Average was the Asian fruto do mer with mostly noodles, with wine at $13. Disgusting was Miguel Laffan\\s stale, cold, greasy chips. When I returned them to the unhappy staff saying I expected hot, fresh chips, I was told to get the fries if I wanted hot fresh potatoes. They were also tasteless other than the grease, and not vey hot, suggesting they preboil their potatoes and only dip them in hot oil."

You can see all the kitchens, so if you are keen to see how it all goes together you can get a great view. My partner and I chose tasting dishes from different chefs and shared all the yummy experiences, over four different glasses of wine (there is also beer, juices, bar, coffee etc) We then wandered over and finished up with a gelati - just a great was to get a wonderful meal and sample as much of Portugal as you possible can in one meal. Very affordable, easy to get to (its on the Hop On Hop Off bus routes, the down town tram and the Metro) and all round awesome experience. Im thinking seriously about doing it again tomorrow."

The food stalls are all vetted for their menus, what they sell, how clean they are, etc, which is good. There are stalls catering for many different tastes in cuisine, which is good, so you won't be stuck for choice. You order, take a buzzer/light thing, which buzzes and lights up when your food is ready and then you eat on the long refectory style tables laid out in the centre area. If you want 'fine dining', this isn't for you but if you are after a quick meal that is nice but not too filling (for that, read mingy, really!) then this will serve the purpose.

We started with really tasty tapas and wine and made our way around a few stands enjoying some sushi and gyoza and delicious tempura.We also went back one night and it had a totally different atmosphere. Really busy with a great vibe and everyone enjoying themselves. Again we had some really good wines and beer and a selection of food.There was lots of choice for both savoury and sweet food and I thought there was plenty on offer in terms of drinks as well.It is probably not the cheapest place to eat in the city but it does offer great variety and it has a really lovely atmosphere.

We visited twice and suggest to definitely try pouring your own beer at Beer experience and a tart from the bakery store near the cooking area (forgot the name but you will not miss the array of delicious tarts and cakes in the display). There is also fruit markets to the side and an art display upstairs. "

This is an amazing epicurean addition to Lisbon and one of the best food halls (a title that doesn't do it justice) I have ever been to. Don't be overwhelmed on your first visit by the number of options and people. Best if there are two of you. Take a few turns to decide on what you want and one person stay with your seats while the other goes for their food. There is a relatively good turn over of people so you shouldn't have to search too long for a place but at the weekend it will probably be hard to find spaces together for 3 or more. Also not so sure if you have small children but great for the evening out. So many great options - fish, sushi, burgers, meat, Asian. Also most of the franchises have really good wine but for beer drinkers on one brand of beer but several different types."

All the stalls need their own different times for their dishes and if you wait then food becomes cold and you may not necessarily find a table with 5 empty chairs. All depends what time of the day you go. Food was good, no doubt but think of it as a tester platter/dish than to go there for an evening out with friends. Its on the higher side of reasonable enough but without the full prices. Plate presentation is still top class and I suggest to stick with the few local celebrity chefs than go for anything else.In short its a place to go try once or spend a late afternoon if you have nowhere else to go in this city with fab food! :-)"

The food court is huge, with long tables all the way down the middle. Hundreds of people were eating there when we arrived. The noise was deafening, here weren't nearly enough chairs, and people were almost fighting for somewhere to sit down. We managed to find enough space that we could at least at least put our plastic plates down, but couldn't get seats - even though we were standing next to a family who had finished eating, but just grinned at us and continued to sit and watch us the whole time we were eating. In such a busy place, someone should make sure that people move on when they've finished and let other people sit down. We'd picked what claimed to be a very well-respected fish restaurant outlet to buy our meal from, and it really wasn't very nice - the chips were hard, the fish seriously undercooked and everything was cold. The only good things were that the wine wasn't terrible and it was all very cheap. Not cheap enough for us to want to return, though. We were glad to leave."

There were lots of vendors, so I recommend going more tapas style, but you really cant go wrong with any of the booths. Over two and a half days, I must have tried 3/4ths of them and they were excellent. Its also extremely well located. My wife and I followed up dinner with drinks by the water.

We were told they were not ready for us and to come back in 10 minutes even though a number of their workers were absolutely doing nothing.

We went three times and on each occasion it was packed with a very lively (and quite loud) atmosphere. It does get very busy so you wouldn't go here for a quiet meal and as a result, it can take some time to find some seats. But we got some drinks on arrival, took some time walking around the hall looking for our preferences (different places for starters and mains on some occassions) and then found some seats while the food was being prepared.The Mercado da Ribeira offers a fun and not expensive eating experience - one of the best I've experienced in many years. We will definitely be visiting again when we are next in Lisbon and I would recommend this to anyone who's into good food in a great atmosphere."

It has a food court with over 30 stalls. I can't call it a \"food court\" because in the US, food court connotates fast and subpar food. Not this place. This is like a fine dining food court. It was so hard for us to decide which stalls to try. We ended up trying 2 stalls: Monte Mar and Henrique Sa Pessoa. We ordered the mussels at Monte Mar and it came out steaming hot with beautiful tomato and onion sauce. The mussels were beautifully cooked; meaning it was not overcooked. They were sweet and so good. We ended up getting an additional order because my son basically didn't give us a chance to eat the first order. :-) At Henrique Sa Pessoa, we ordered baby bass tartare with avocado, mango and salmon roe and also 24 hour confit suckling pig with sweet potato puree. The baby bass tartare is what you would get at a 5 star restaurant; it's beautifully presented. Did I say this was from a food court? Then the piece de resistance. OMG, the suckling pig was SO GOOD! My husband and I pigged out!! Ha! I wish they have one of these food court in Houston. I would eat there every day and try different stalls every day. This is ingenious!

There are a couple of signs that say please find a seat after you receive your food (or something close to that). But that's not really possible nor do people pay attention to it. If you go there with a group of 2 or more, find a seat first and then order your food in waves. Otherwise you might be eating standing up.

This one was reminiscent of one I went to in Budapest. A few of the kiosk-style restaurants are run by well-known chefs and we decided to try different foods from a couple of these. Husby went for a gourmet burger which was thick, meaty and very flavoursome. I had always wanted to try a Francesinha (a stacked meat, sausage and melted cheese sandwich floating in a meaty, spicy sauce with a fried egg on top \u2013 yes, a heart attack on a plate and forget the diet!) with chips and it was awesome, an explosion of flavour and the chips were really good too. I struggled to finish it all and husby was happy to oblige! This place is for anyone who loves informal dining, from simply grabbing a bottle of wine from one of the kiosks and sitting down with some cheese, bread and sardines to trying out one of the well-presented, chef prepared dishes.

In fact, several of the best chefs in Lisbon such as Alexandre Silva, Henrique S\u00e1 Pessoa, Miguel Castro Silva, to name a few, have a presence here. These chefs have expensive restaurants throughout the city but offer the same high quality food for less at Ribeira Market. We each tried at least 2-3 different places every time we visited and haven't had a bad meal yet!Since there are so many choices, you don't have to pay top dollar for a meal, unless you want to. You can have tapas for as low as 4 Euro or Pizza for 2 Euro or a great tuna dish with Cozinha da Felicidadfor 9 Euro and the wine choice is spectacular!! The best part is, if you are traveling with a family of picky eaters, this is one place where everyone can find something to suit their taste buds.

But this is part of the experience as you can always venture to another store front and order another meal. Allowing you to sample a variety. Do like the open space and communal seating. Allows you to meet others and get into the spirit of the place. Not all the best chefs of Lisboa are represented here. And that shouldn't be expected. It simply allows you to try many curated dishes in one space. This is hardly a food court experience and the reference to McDonalds is a bit hyperbolic."

Our food was excellent and we could see lots of satisfied looks around us as people tried their different dishes from different stalls. Good prices too. A lot of tourists but plenty of locals too. We tried a similar place in Madrid but it was too chaotic whereas Mercado da Ribeira is busy without being manic. There were always places to sit at a table. And the stalls give you an electronic device to let you know when your food is ready to collect (yes, they make it fresh to order). Definitely a \"must see\" for lunch in Lisbon."

If you are looking for a place where all the restaurant staff speak English and you want familiar foods (i.e. hamburgers, noodles), or don't mind paying double what you would for meal in a decent local restaurant, then this is the place. Additiionally, the seating is uncomfortable (high wooden stools) and the hard edges on them and the tables don't exactly make it a place where you just want to sit back and enjoy a leisurely meal. Lisbon is filled with so many great little restaurants that it just seems like a wasted opportunity to eat here."

Many of the city's top restaurants and bars (including two with Michelin stars) have semi-permanent booths at the market. Some offer bar-style seating, but many don't. Where the restaurants don't offer seating, you can take your food to the communal benches in the centre of the market. We ate in the Mercado on several occasions. It is perfect for eating in small groups - everyone can choose to eat dishes from different restaurants. It might be a little stressful to visit the market as a large group as there's no guarantee that you will find seats together.

It's not far from the centre of town.It's quite a different experience from your normal sit down meal and there is a great atmosphere. If you have a family with very differing taste buds then it's definitely worth a try. Our kids really enjoyed the buzz and option to go different stalls.The food was great \u2014 but it didn't feel like the 'best' Lisbon (or Portugal) had to offer as the marketing suggests. Because of space constraints a number of the stalls looked like they relied on 'pre-fabricated' dishes. They also have Santini ice-cream without the massive queues.Couple of notes: 1. You can end up eating at different times if you order from different places.2. I would go fairly early as it can get really busy and finding seats (especially if you are with a large group) can get tricky. Some of the locals were getting a bit tetchy, and would hassle you for your seat, all part of the fun I suppose."

For hipster, but also for tourists, foodies and young people it is for sure nice to pass by and have a drink or some food. You have like thirty food stall all around the market and some healthy stuff and drinks in the middle. There is a lot of place to sit and watch others doing their thing. Prices are reasonable and yes, there are many people working there and not all very friendly. But that should not stop you enjoying this spot. It's on the way to Belem so a great chance for lunch?"

There is also an excellent wine counter where you get a lesson in Portuguese wines, juice counter, the best ice creams and desserts, the list goes on. It's not cheap but the atmosphere is worth the extra cost. What an amazing place, definitely recommend a visit. Don't rush as you need time to decide what to eat and drink and at busy times there are short queues. Not a place for small children.

We realised it was a market that was already closed(at 7 pm) -mercado do Ribeira. We still entered just to pass through and we had the greatest suprise: on the left hand, with no sign, there was a large hall full of all kind of restaurants you can immagine, all in equal squares. More than 500 people(locals 99%) were siting in tr large hall, having dinner with friends, fammily or just enjoying a glass of wine. The food is excelend and is for all tastes and pockets. I tried the fresh oysters for 2\u20ac each and the shrimps in order to taste some local dish and the nigiri from a japones restaurant. The latter one was average (I paid 10 \u20ac for 6 pieces) but the first 2 courses were absolutely delicious. I liked the best the atmosphere: young couples, old couples, families with childrens, friends, all at the same long wood tables having a nice evening. I do recommand to buy a bottle of wine instead of a glass. We had Dalva, by Miguel Castro e Silva and it was one of the finest one we had in Portugal. The bottle was 15\u20ac, but one can find cheapest wine or more expensive ones, depending on what kind of a \"connoisseur\" of Portugal wines are you. We just chose from medium up.

Lots of tourists, can't imagine what it looks like during the summer. It took a while to find seats for four. But the real issue for us was the food. We tried a few different vendors and the price simply does not justify the quality, or lack of such. We could have gotten much better food for same price (maybe less) at a restaurant, sitting down and with a waiter. Visited it for the experience since there was so much buzz about it. Not planning on going back or recommending it."

What a great idea, this is a big covered market with a produce section of the market selling vegetables, fruit, fish, meat etc. but also another big section of the market which has lots of communal long tables with all different food and drink outlets around the outside. The fantastic thing about this idea is that it allows you to try lots of different things, and if you are a family, one of you can get pizza from one place, another person can get sushi from somewhere else, but then you can all sit together in the middle and eat your different dishes. The choice and quality of the food is amazing, noodles, sushi, croquettes, pizza, pretty much everything is available. Also a lot of the outlets have restaurants elsewhere in the city, so it's a great place to go early on in your trip as you can try places out here and if you like the food decide to visit their restaurant, as we did with the Sea Me outlet. We loved it here, it's such a simple, good idea, it's also great because sitting at the big tables in the middle, you can see what others have chosen to eat, and there are lots of \"where did you get that from?\" moments when you see delicious things others are munching."

We had lunch on a Saturday sitting at one of the food stalls, one thing to note in winter months wear a warm coat as can be cold. Our steak meal with the traditional Portugese sauce was out of this world,washed down with some red wine. We popped by again on Saturday evening just for a drink and the atmosphere was amazing with the centre floor space given over to the locals doing the tango to some fado music. Unfortunatly on our next visit on Sunday things went downhill for us. We were taking some pictures(is this not what tourists do?) and the owner (I presume) of the hamburger outlet took exception to this and told us to stop. We saw no signs in the building pointing this out. I then went on to have some sushi from the stand next to the hamburger stall and within two hours I was taken ill with food poisoning which meant having to spend the rest of my stay in Lisbon confined to bed which ruined our holiday. Now back home I am still off work with the illness."

Apart from the fact that it is supposed to have regional Portuguese cuisine, so what are sushi, pizzas , hamburgers etc doing there? I think roughly only 50 % of the cuisine was regional. The design of the market hall was very cool but at the same time soulless, very pretentious and quite expensive for the experience we had. We went to a kiosk that had a variety of croquettes and although they were quite good, some of them were cold when they should have been served hot.Then we went to another kiosk and I ordered some grilled sausages and pineapple skewers and again they were lukewarm but this time I complained and I was given some more with no much enthusiasm from the staff. The sausages were a touch too hard with a strong flavour, together with a strange unidentifiable sausage/pate which I found weird and unpleasant. The thing I enjoyed most was the grilled pineapple! I wonder if the place has always served this kind of food or when they opened not so long ago it was more dedicated to regional Portuguese cuisine? By the way the best thing was a slice of a margherita pizza. If you want to eat authentic Portuguese food head towards the Alfama district. The food is so good and the prices are so cheap that they make you feel embarrassed."

Very good.When we were there in January it was busy with locals which is always a good sign. It can be a little cold in there in January as it has large open doors and the wooden seats get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours. Would love to see some soft seating in the centre. The shop A Vida Portuguesa has a small shop there which was good as the one in Chiado was shut for renovation. Great shop. Well worth finding the big store in Intendente in an old tile factory.

Try to split the meal with colleagues in order to taste as much as possible keeping in mind that \"Prego de Atum em bolo do caco de Alfarroba\" and \"Almondegas de Salm\u00e3o com choco\" from SEA ME is a must.For the desert take the \"Melhor bolo de chocolate do Mundo\" or the ice cream from Santini. Enjoy!"

A place to visit and have a wine, a fresh juice, a nice cocktail and try some really good portuguese food. I strongly recommend Sea Me (the vieiras with mango chutney) and the chocolate cake from Arcadia, but everything I tried there is delicious. Keep in mind it's not the most comfortable place (no table service) and may get really crowded and noise sometimes. If possible, avoid weekends."

            "review": "NOT TO BE MISSED!!!! Like, 4 real!!!. We plan this trip to Lisbon for many reasons. First because we have a friend that\u00b4s from there and he was bragging big time about his hometown. Second because I have already been there and I totally loved it, but big time. And third because it was meant to happen. I mean, I write, for fun and for profession. I had to write an article about an interesting capital in Europe and Lisbon, along with Zurich, was the option that I loved the most.The article is done, very well done if I must say. I\u00b4m humble and down to earth, but I am also able to acknowledge the fact that a paper is well done when is that way, you know, because I wrote it with passion and with lots of love, also, I was so grateful with life for taking me there, I was totally ready for this trip. Third time in Lisbon and felt like it was the first one. Such an awesome place, such kind happy people there being nice and welcoming, all capitals in the world should be inhabited by this kind of people, you know, the kind that make you love their city even more, the kind that make your trip an even better experience and turn something that could have been very nice to a very beautiful and unforgettable memory. This trip to Lisbon is one never to be forgotten.lately I have been using Airbnb for all my stays, I\u00b4m kinda addicted to it, it\u00b4s so efficient. You end up staying at a house (or an apartment of course) of someone that really lives there and see and experience the place you visit starting with the fact that the place you go to bed to and wake up in is not a hotel, made to be liked and enjoyed by anyone, but in a space that some considers its home, an actual inhabited space, built and decorated with the heart and dedication of the person that gets to enjoy it on the regular basis. That makes a huge difference. So we chose a handful of options and gave it to our Lisbon born friend to choose the area and place. he settled with a very peculiar apartment that resembled a labyrinth with a lot of elements that were familiar to me but also new.You see, I\u00b4m an architect (also interior designer), and the huge apartment we stayed in was a gigantic place owned and (obviously) designed by an architect, and probably built as well, because a lot of things looked very hand made, you know what I mean? the idea was perfect, the execution pretty \"manual\". But all in all it was a great place to stay, perfectly located in Barrio Alto, a neighborhood that\u00b4s like Lisbon\u00b4s Soho, you know, the place to be. So, we were across this little square with a church and all and the structure of a market seemed in they bottom of the street that was perpendicular to ours, just 100 meters (300 ft) away, very nonchalant and unassuming, just there, as if it had had been there since a very long time (it was just inaugurated on the 1st of january of 1882... No biggie). It turned out this humble quiet place was the Time Out Mercado da Ribeira, a new concept sponsored by the super well known Time Out brand. Very low key but really a wonderful super cool place.Awesome place and cool concept for any kind of food in Lisbon. Yes, this is the new place for foodies. There\u00b4s everything you can wish for related to food in Lisbon. Mostly Portuguese stuff but with a few splashes of italian and two or three places for sweets.We had Marlene Vieira, a fantastic Lagareiro Octopus, grilled with a side of spinach and potatoes, plus salad and dessert, with a complementary glass of white wine thank you very much; not the best white wine, but the intention is so noble and the price so affordable that I really donut care. 12 euros for the whole thing and it was more than enough, not the finger food size that you get in Paris in places like the Fish Club, there, Oh God!! They seem to be playing little kitchen, ridiculous amounts of food for a super expensive price, big \"no no\", meaning \"no, don\u00b4t go there, with the amount of money you will invest in that place, you could probably buy a round trip to Lisbon from anywhere in Europe, that affordable Lisbon is and that expensive Paris. Although I still love Paris very much and always say \"Paris is always a good idea\" and \"We\u00b4ll always have Paris\" and stuff. So, you can say I love it very much. But lets focus in Lisbon and this wonderful market, shall we?For dessert we had this amazing Lemon Merengue and these milk and cinnamon like truffles sooooooooooo good. Oh!!! And since I was super duper hungry when I got there, that I went to this place in one of the corners named Croqueteria and got two chicken croquettes, so unbelievably good, super unexpected, like I sorta knew how they would taste, only they tasted like a thousand times better and had this hints of chorizo, only it was only chicken, it was all the work of spices and a mastery in the art of making croquettes. Not an easy task.I\u00b4m super stuffed because I just had dinner and my mouth is still watering, can you believe that? Of corse tomorrow waking up I\u00b4ll have my 750 mlx of green tea and then I will be off for a run, at least 7 miles, doesn\u00b4t matter how cold it is, I need to put this calories off and get ready for my gastronomical adventures in the healthiest way possible. So, in case you find yourself in Lisbon and have no idea what to eat. Narrow your options and go to this super cutting edge atmosphere place, you have a great arrange of options, and if you go with your partner or a group of friends, even better, that way you can all order something different and all taste everything!!!!! Great idea, right? Well, don\u00b4t thank me, just book your flight to Lisbon and enjoy the super positive warm attitude of the people in the capital of Portugal and the beautiful city they have built for themselves. they are so lucky... I could totally live there. For real."

Its basically a large warehouse within which sits a market and the central part has been developed into an open seating area centred around several bars with a series of kiosk type restaurants around the outside. It does look fantastic. Started off having a good wander around the place and most of the food outlets had interesting menus. Kicked off, inadvertently, by ordering 3 sliders (thought they were tapas dishes) which comprised green bean tempura; fried fish and onions (almost like jellied eels) and pork cheeks in a light mustard sauce. This ended up being the highlight as all where delicious fillings within a light, swishy, bread bun. Then moved onto the outlet with the longest queue and tried the confit of pork with sweet potato puree. This was a major disappointment as it comprised an average bit of pork belly which had congealed and included lots of sinewy bits. Almost inedible. Missus had the 65 degree egg which was honestly just a bowl of tasteless gloop. When my youngest daughter woke up I took her over to the deli place selling the mixed cheese and meat boards. Both the cheese and meat were a bit of a pile of sweaty mess but didn't taste too bad although were majorly overpriced for 10 euros a pop. All in all, whilst the place looks great the quality of the food isn't too far away from a shopping mall food court. Really felt like I wasted 2 meals worth of food eating here. I recommend you pop into see it but just have a snack or a drink and move on."

(Henrique Pessida) Been travelling for 2 months eating out a lot and this may be the best meal I've had the whole trip. My partner had the Thai green curry from Asian lab, he said it had really good flavours but too much rice. Yesterday I had crispy prawns with basil and curry mayo which were also very good. Great place to go when everyone feels like something different. Restaurant quality food for cheap prices!"

We decided to walk down to the Mercado da Ribeira for dinner as we heard it was more of a 'market'/casual environment. The market is only about a 10 minute walk from our rented apartment in Chiado. Note the walk there includes a walk down a pretty steep hill. As well, the walk and surrounding areas were quite dark and secluded. Being our first night there we were mindful of our environment. Despite the quiet surroundings, the market itself is quiet bustling. The food was good but I would not consider it a highlight in terms of food. What really stood out for me was the concept, something I'd yet to stumble across at home or my previous travels. It was fine dining in a food court environment. The seating area are wooden benches with accompanying sitting benches or stools. The vendors were fine dining in feel. Chef this and that. Wine glasses in plastic trays and seafood of your choice. Not your usual shopping mall food fair. We ate at Henrique S\u00e1 Pessoa. We had the tuna tartar, slow cooked with truffled mash potatoes and a Portuguese style steak and egg. Also a glass of wine. Food was good but I wouldn't call it great. Bill came out to around 30 euros. So not bad value. I think the mercado is a must try. Walk around pick your food and wine. It's a really neat concept."

For a self-service restaurant in Portugal it is overpriced, and you need to join the queues for whichever stall you pick.This takes considerable time pushing through the crowds to see what is on offer before you can select your food . The cheapest from any of the stalls was 8 Euros plus. This would be considerably more than in England I would suggest, and somewhat surprised it was so very busy-and noisy. You have to hunt to try and find a gap in the benches to eat your choice-then join another queue for drinks. You can be served in a restaurant by a waiter/waitress at your own table for less than this in the centre of Lisbon. I felt it was poor value and not worth the walk from the centre of town. Not good value for a self-service set-up."

This is a project of the weekly magazine Time Out Lisbon, but the other side of the market is still functioning as usual, and you can go there to buy your fresh groceries. Loved the idea although there are a few things that pass as a little bit pretentious. Aspects of the decoration, some abuse of English words for common use concepts and the overall posh ambience that contrasts a lot with the market's \"real\" wing. And although I love the location it's really noisy, one can't hear oneself think...What saves it all is the excellent quality food and plenty to choose from. I ate a Tiborna, a sort of elaborate toast with traditional Portuguese ingredients and pork cheeks with sweet potato pur\u00e9e. Yummy! For desert, as it was hot, nothing better than an ice cream at Santini.There are all sorts of cuisines to choose from, from seafood or hamburgers to snacks or deserts, focusing mostly on Portuguese flavours, with known chef's stalls. Contrary to the mall's food courts, you choose what you feel like eating and not what type of food you usually have. At Mercado da Ribeira quality and flavour are guaranteed!There were also some small stalls with some crafts and merchandise, sadly most of them weren't Portuguese and not so crafty."

Prices are not cheap but not expensive either as you are getting restaurant quality food and presentation, in fast-food time and at a lot less than you would pay at a decent restaurant.

Located just alongside the train station in Av 24 de Julho and not between the station and the river where tripadvisor's map shows it - thankfully we found it as kids were getting a bit fed up of wondering around! (with your back to the train station ticket barriers walk out of left exit turn left and walk for 50m back alongside the tracks and it's on the opposite side of the main road) And well worth finding, especially the ham stall which we visited twice - a selection of 'pata negra' ham (presunto ib\u00e9rico), bread, olive oil and a bottle of vihno verde can't be beaten. If you are lucky you may see a whole ham being prepared and cut which is interesting. Get there for early or late lunch or early dinner to avoid the crowds. Have a look about at the 35 stalls, find a communal table, which you may need to take turns in saving, and then 'dive in' and place your orders! I think it's more of a lunch venue as lacks some atmosphere and if you're all off choosing from different offers it can get a bit complicated as people wait for food. Albeit as a late night post drinks food venue I guess it takes some beating! (open until 2am Thurs-Sat, midnight other times) There are some proper resturants located in the venue too, as opposed to the tasting stalls, so perhaps starters outside and mains in the restaurants is an evening option too. Each day except Sundays, until lunchtime, there is also a traditional fish, meat and veg market there that's worth a look. A great way to start or finish a days sight seeing in Lisbon."

Ok, how can I give my feedback without being too demotivating? ....The place looks like the streets on the movie Blade Runner but instead of oriental people serving oriental food you have trendy stalls, owened by the today fashion chefs, serving portuguese food.Although it was packed, I can't see why people enjoy going to one of the stalls, buy food and then have to search for a place to sit with tray on their hands. Specially when most of the sits seem to be taken. It's a huge canteen with fancy and a bit overpriced food. Let's imagine that during your meal you need another drink.... you'll have to go and queue in front of one the stalls to get it and leave your tray at the table in the middle of hundreds of people you don't know.Ok, it can be a very trendy concept but just not for me."

Both times the food was very good and choice was exceptional. We ate from one of the chefs stalls on the first time, both having a lovely steak based dish, and then followed this up with a cake.The 2nd time we visited I had an amazing Burger, and my partner had Pad Thai, again these were high quality"

During the first week of grand opening, they haven't calculated the number of people who join to experience this great place, so after you grab your food be patient until you find a seat to eat.The food is great, you have many high-end kitchen and chefs, which means you won't be disappointed.The market is renewed, and it's very well designed. The only problem again, it's the seats. Some people stay on the table without food just waiting for their friends to arrive, this is not good behavior and it should be monitored by security."

Yeah!!!5 chefs let us try their expertise with low cost, and other restaurants let us choose what our hungry wants to.I love the \"Croqueteria\". The alheira one is perfect! And tuna with dry tomato... hummmToday my husband tried Henrique S\u00e1 Pessoa's pork cheek. Delicious! Perfect mashed potatoes.I order a \"bacalhau a Br\u00e1s\" from Miguel Castro e Silva. It was ok... It was served with raw egg yolks mixed with the rest of the ingredients. Not bad, but...

The problem here is that everything seems so artificial. All restaurants name paltes are in black with letters in white (ok these are the colours of Lisbon's flag), giving the place a very orderly and padronized look. Tables are not enough, the noise makes imposible to follow what your friends are saying.If you like to mingle among wannabe lisboetas this is the place to go. If you rather prefer a simple tasca or a a restaurant where locals go just for the pleasure of being together and not for the sake of seeing and being seened, go to Ramiro, a Tosca, taberna as Flores, Caf\u00e9 no Chiado, Cervajaria Trindade and the sort.Mercado da Ribeira best value is the gigantic red quisoque just in the garden outside.For a \"gourmet\" kind of eatery is fine, but is lacks true character."

Great concept that you definitely have to try.I was there with friends on a Friday evening, with a large screen showing the world cup football game between Brazil and Colombia, so the place was a bit hectic, but we loved the atmosphere."

It is perfect for a group when you all fancy different kinds of food - there is something for everyone! I love the concept - there are 35 kiosks selling different types of food & drink so you'll be spoilt for choice & never bored. I had Pad Thai from the Asian Lab, which was very delicious & freshly made whilst I waited. I definitely recommend the cocktails at Chinco & you must have a traditional Portuguese custard tart from Aloma. Everything is freshly made to order & very cheap considering the quality! This place is very trendy & popular so be warned it gets busy & times it can be a struggle to find somewhere to sit especially with a big group. The only thing that lets it down (the reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that they need to employ more people to clear up the trays & clean the tables. We saw people piling up trays on the table so that they could sit. I personally prefer going at lunch for this reason! Either way you can't go wrong with the food experience. We were surprised at how late they were open...on Saturday is was 2am & they were still serving food. Overall, great food, brilliant experience - worth going to again & again!"

We had a tough time getting a table that could fit our group of 7, and getting chairs for everyone was a bit challenging as well. Once we were all seated, we took turns to get food at restaurant booths so that there was always someone saving our seats. I got stuff from three booths, and it was a bit challenging to manage. It would probably be best to get food from just one place. I ordered and paid in the first and then went on to the next one to order and pay and so forth. Then I had to wait at least 15 min for my food to be ready and I went to collect it to each of the booths i had ordered from and took it to the table. In the meantime, I had to go back and forth several times to check if my dinner was ready but there is no better way of doing it (they should be introduced to those vibrating pagers). Staff was friendly and polite but the service was very slow and several specials had already sold out in some of the booths. The best food I got was from Sea Me (sardine nigiri, oysters and scalops). I think it is probably to visit Mercado da Ribeira in a smaller group and order all your dinner from just one booth. Prices were fair but be warned of small portion sizes which were very unusual for Portuguese standards."

If you're visiting Lisbon for a short period of time I strongly suggest you to go here if you would like to have contact with most of the portuguese delicacies. The closest MTR station is Cais do Sodr\u00e9 (the opposite site of the road) or if you're in Chiado area go straight to Pra\u00e7a Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es (near Bairro Alto) and go all the way down on the river direction (Cais do Sodr\u00e9), Mercado da Ribeira is just located on your right hand side.

Half the stalls we tried to order from were unable to use their credit card machines and the ATM in the Mercado was non functional.
