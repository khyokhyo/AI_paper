The external features, especially the mosaic fronting the Republic Square, are superb, but there are real jewels inside. Do a guided tour if you can. If you can get to a concert in the Smetana Hall, which takes up the centre of the building, you're in for a real treat. The ceiling is wonderful. There's a cafe and a restaurant off the main entrance, which each have wonderful ambiance, especially the restaurant. Go there for a romantic dinner in superb, turn-of-the-20th-century surroundings."

We were able to get into the \"private rooms\" which are just the most stunning bits of architecture, furnishings, tapestries, fabrics, etc. ... An orchestra was practicing Smetana during our tour in the main concert hall and, while we couldn't go in it, you could peek through the door and hear the music in the hallway. Learn about this building - inside and out!"

If you have an appreciation for Art Nouveau, absolutely don't miss taking a guided tour of the Municipal House. When making reservations for the tour, also book a concert in Smetana Hall and arrive early to eat at one of 3 restaurants on the premises. It is a complete package in my estimation. We ate in the lowest level restaurant with low pricing and thought the meal was excellent. If you eat the evening meal, there is rousing folk music. The guided tour takes 1 hour and walks you through Smetana Concert Hall and 6-8 salons, each unique and gorgeously Art Nouveau-designed by different artists. Be sure to look out the windows in the Alfonse Mucha decorated room. This is my second time to see this treasure. Tickets were only available within 10 days of your visit. The schedule in not consistent (Ex: not always M-Tu-Sat-Sun). My guess would be that the tour guides are retired, supporters of this wonderful structure and they sign up when they can be available. If you want to take photos inside you must pay extra and they give you a yellow tag to wear. If you don't take photos you will regret your decision."

One such building is the Municipal House Hall. The foyer and restaurants are all excellent examples of the style. Another building is the Imperial Palace Hotel which is just down the road. The building/s are well maintained, so it is a joy to view them in their splendour."

My favourite place to have a coffee is the restaurant in this building, because of its stunning decor and it has a nice terrace.Cross over the bridge to the other side of Prague where you can visit the palace. It is a completely different world there. To me the energy there also felt different. Whereas the downtown core was bustling, happy and lively, I found this part of Prague quite somber.For excursions I can recommend a daytrip to Cesky Krumlov, a quaint village with a beautiful castle, and Kutna Hora where it is Halloween every day in the Bone Chapel. Amazing what one can do with skeletons and skulls! Also visit John Lennon's Wall."

If you're attending a concert as we did go early and take pictures. With its intricate stonework, gold trimmings,frescoes and stained glass windows, it is absolutely stunning. And it boasts the largest concert hall in Prague and a huge glass dome.It makes me a little sad that this site was originally the Royal Court Palace where the King of Bohemia once lived. But since they demolished that building (imagine what IT looked like) in the early 20th century and built this one instead, we have to be happy with the beauty this building gives us."

Municipal House - or as the Czechs call it Obecni Dum or Representacni Dum ( REPRE for short).You can choose to come for a concert in The Smetana Hall, or visit one of the three restaurants, or a bar. The beautiful Ballroom with the glass dome ceiling is why I used to come here with my friends during my school days - to dance the night away. A prom night or a winter ball was a highlight to be enjoyed in this building, in the Soviet era. The facade of the building was much neglected during those days, but the interior with its massive chandeliers and beautiful artwork still managed to shine brightly. To access most of what is to be admired inside the building is limited to taking a tour. While I am not a fan of taking tours, especially not in Prague, it may be a good option for you. The premises up a flight of stairs are otherwise roped off.Obviously the restaurants that are housed to both sides of the lobby and one flight down are a good experience, most of the time, and a great way to enjoy the fabulous and historically important Art Nouveau building. The terrace outside is a nice place to watch the world go by. Don't miss the beautifully restored mosaic above the entrance named - Homage to Prague- set between the two groups of allegorical statues symbolizing the Degradation and Resurrection of the People.REPRE was and still is one of my favorite places in Prague.I never miss it...You should not miss it either..."

The architecture and design are magnificent and unique and the building houses several great venues. If you do nothing but walk by, it will be worth it. The structure and exterior decoration are beautiful. But definitely at least go inside and walk around as every square inch and design feature is unique and delightful. From the doorknobs, to light fixtures, to the tile work and decoration, they really went all out in creating this and it is nothing less than a magnificent artistic achievement. The MH houses a variety of famous concert venues and restaurant/bars. We attended an evening concert in Smetana Hall that we booked online in the US prior to our trip. This was actually unnecessary and there were plenty of tickets available and open seats for our show and many other similar concerts bookable the same day. The concert performance was fine - a capable string quartet playing a short selection of classics and a few interesting numbers - but the experience of being in this historic and beautiful hall really made it special. After the show we went down to the Americky Bar - basically deserted that evening - and had a wonderful old-school cocktail bar experience. The decor in there was particularly amazing and the cocktails and service were really first class - highly recommended. The Municipal House has a lot going on and should definitely be on your short list for things to see in Prague."

I personally think Prague should be at least as much about its Art Nouveau (not to be confused with Art Deco) legacy as it is about Charles the IVth and in this respect you can't miss the Municipal House hall. If you're lucky enough to visit while there is an exhibition, go. There was one about Art Nouveau precisely when we were there, with pieces from a local museum (furniture, paintings, posters...) and it was absolutely empty while the Charles bridge was 150% packed. And exhibitions give you access to the floors of the building, allowing to see other marvels of its inside architecture."

The building itself, near Republic Square (Namesty Republiki) has beautiful art-nouveau interiors and several levels of galleries, restaurants and exhibition halls. Local residents come here for jazz, classical concerts, art exhibits and even theater. Admission to the building is free, and it is worth it just to ride the great elevator to the top (pretend you have a sprained ankle and they\u2019ll get someone to run the elevator). Then take the stairs down to look at every ornate object along the way. As Trip Advisor itself has noted, \u201cthe building was also one of the first in the city to be equipped with central heating and ventilation, a drinking and utility water-supply system, electrical as well as hydraulic elevators, a steam-powered laundry and an intercom network.\u201d If you\u2019re lucky, there may be a jazz band playing to the crowd from the veranda overlooking the square. No hotel concierge told us, but a local wall advertisement announced the art nouveau exhibit at Municipal House. The subway that stops across the street. The exhibit was a delight, featuring everything from painting and paper art to furniture and glass ware, including some oriental influences on art nouveau. The exhibit is open ten a.m. to seven p.m, and the 150 KR ticket (about six dollars) also entitles a 20 per cent discount at the Kavarna Restaurant in the building. The exhibit is open until July 31, 2016. The Municipal House bookstore sells many items from the art nouveau period, some of them reasonably priced, and it also offers a 300-page illustrated catalogue of the Prague Design Museum\u2019s full exhibit (from which the Municipal Hall exhibit is drawn). Guided tours are available with advance booking at 778-543-902 for groups speaking English, French, German or Russian.  If you are in Prague, you owe it to yourself to come here."

It's worth paying a little extra to be able to take pictures during the tour. The Municipal Building was built and designed for entertainment, including a stunning concert hall, where concerts were held almost daily during our visit. Every room was in designed differently with the most exquisite attention to detail. Just the variety of chandeliers in each room of the tour is worth the tour! The outside of the building is interesting, but the treasure is inside!

Located just steps from our hotel in Old Town, it was completed in 1912, just as Czechoslovakia was about to achieve independence from the Austro-Hungarian empire and is an Art Nouveau marvel that celebrates a nation coming into being. The Frankuszka restaurant on the ground floor has amazing art nouveau lighting and elegant food. Upstairs, there are a series of remarkable ceremonial rooms, each designed and decorated by a prominent Czech artist of the time. Perhaps the most beautiful is the room done by Alphonse Mucha, the great art nouveau master, who painted the ceiling and all of the walls with scenes from Czech history. This building is worth making time for."

Somewould say it is the most famous Art Nouveau building in Prague. There was a competiton in 1903 for the best design with construction beginning about 1905 and finishing in 1912. Most everyone starts their visit rushing into the interior; however, from the outside of the front of the building take a step back and look up to see the mosaic of a Tribute to Prague and below that the decorative marquise which covers the main entrance. The great works of Mucha are well known in the interior as are those by Zenisek and Novak. When you are in the Mayoral Hall viewing the works of Mucha be sure to ask your guide to identify in the ceiling the different figures in Czech history such as Charles IV, Jan Hus, George Potebrad and others. Really interesting. We walked-up for tickets to the 3:00 English language visit. Guide was well versed and it was a pleasant hour."

Smetana Hall and the smaller rooms around the perimeter simply amazing decoration and chandeliers. Tour size limited to 35 and in April only 3 tours per day. Adult cost 290 CZK.

We were on Notice.....In A Cadogan Guide from 1994 it said , \"all meals served with a snarl.... one day a meal here might be as pleasurable as the Art Nouveau interior \"The snarl had gone but the food was really poor and the service non existent. We had six servers , no one knew who had ordered what and when we asked why no-one had asked us whether we had enjoyed the meal ( perhaps someone sensed we were not over the moon ), that question was met with a shrug.The wine was expensive and the food very poor value.Give this restaurant a wide berth.We will not be returning.Hopefully some day the food and service will match the decor."

The concer hall provided great acoustic and was truly enjoyable given all the lush decorations and the magnitude. The cafe on the left side (when facin front) offeres awesome cakes and desserts, its a must. But go early as the cake variety quickly disappears. On some saturdays there is live music!"

The guided tour, which took about an hour, of the upper floor of the Municipal House did not disappoint. The Mayor Hall was breathtaking, not only did Mucha paint a ceiling fresco as well as three wall frescos, he also designed the window panes and the furniture as well as a beautiful curtain for one of the doors. The tour guide was also very knowledgable about the building and the different artists that created artworks for the various rooms. Initially, the Municipal House was built as a centre for Czech culture and as a place for social gatherings. At the time there was a German casino and the German House, so, the Czech people felt they needed a space of their own to celebrate their culture and history. Today, the Municipal House, is still used for concerts at the famous Smetana Hall and other halls but also for balls and as a civic building. This building is worth a visit as the ground floor and the lower floor can be visited free of charge whereas you need to take a guided tour of the upper floor. And if you want to take pictures during the tour you'll need to buy a photo pass. Check the box office to get the schedule for the tours. The tours are given in Czech or English but there are also written explanations in various other languages like German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese and Russian."

I just dropped by and took a look inside, noting that it has a Concert Hall (Smetana Concert Hall - home base of the National Symphony Orchestra), a couple of restaurants and bar and some exhibition rooms. Guided tour of the building was available for tourists. Since I did not use any of the facilities, I did not know about the interiors but I was impressed by its exterior architectural style and it is worth a re-visit to attend a classical concert and perhaps try its French restaurant. Although it is a rather young building compare with its neighbor, the Powder Tower, I learnt that it does have some historical significance as the proclamation of the independent State of Czech appears to have taken place here."

The interiors are amazing, each room decorated by someone else (Mucha\u00b4s room is stunning). One of the advantages is the lack of tourists in the general tour. While I was waiting for the guided tour, many people bought tickets for evening\u00b4s concerts but barely anybody for the tour inside. I can only recommend it, as even with only about 5 rooms, there is a lot to see and a lot beauty to take in. The tour lasts for about an hour, and are in Czech, English and probably also other languages if requested.You can then visit also other parts of the hall, just to \"take a look\", and notice little architectonic details."

He went in the morning to pick up our tickets but when we got there that night the view was simply spectacular.

After dinner we went to a concert in the Smetana Hall up the broad staircase in the Municipal Hall. The hall is a wonderful example of Art Nouveau with sculptures on the corners and decorations on the domed ceiling and an amazing organ. The gold decorations shone in the low light. The eight piece chamber orchestra played works from Mozart, Brahms, Dvorak and others. The concert lasted about an hour. It was a wonderful concert in a breathtaking hall."

January appears to be a quiet time in Prague and particularly Sunday. The concert was really enjoyable. A chamber Orchestra with 8 musicians played a variety of classical favourites and the acoustics were brilliant. The whole building is a stunning piece of Architecture and atmosphere. The Restaurant before the concert was very quiet we were one of three groups eating at 6.00 p.m. The service was very attentive, the food was outstanding but be prepared for a bill to match. Earlier in the day they do a set menu which looks within the price range of most people. Overall very enjoyable unique experience."

The building is art deco and the hall had the most amazing paintings on the ceiling, of mystical figures riding horses. The 12-member chamber orchestra played Mozart Arias, Dvorak dances and Strauss polkas.There were also 4 ballet dancers and an opera singer for the arias. Lovely night and dinner is available at 3 restaurants in the building. The basement, and two street level restaurants with interesting chadeliers. We ate at the street level brasserie where a 3 course tourist menu costs 290 czk. The soup was watery, but the mains of eorher goulash, roast beef or schnitzel were good. The cake trolley looked amazing but we stuck with fruit salad included on tourist menu. Check the conerts each night, the 7 th and 14th January is Vivaldi, 18 24 30th January is a concery with a selection of Brahams, Mozart, Dvorak. The musicians all play for premier orchestras such as Czech Radio. well worth a visit."

            "review": "Plzenska Beer Hall Restaurant (in basement of The Municipal House Hall). Many may have heard of this beautiful Art Nouveau building near the famed 'Powder Gate' in downtown Prague, site of a celebrated concert venue (Smetana Hall), and a few may even be aware of the elegant French restaurant also located at the site. However, the true 'gem' of the beautiful Municipal House Hall is located in the basement. I refer to the Plzenska Beer Hall Restaurant (often called the 'Pilsen Restaurant'), which is a large, old fashioned beer hall restaurant in the classic fin de siecle Czech style. This traditional Czech gathering spot will remind some of the commodious Bavarian beer halls, but that's where the similarity largely ends. Built in 1905 on the site of the Royal Czech Residence, the Municipal House Hall is a virtual showplace of European Art Nouveau ('Jugendstille') of the early 1900s and features a substantial bill of fare consisting of traditional Czech style food and drinks. It also features, needless to relate, several excellent beers and wines, chief among them all being the famed Pilsner Urquell...a brew of world class fame.Featuring a range of large beer-hall style tables, but also providing a few more intimate tables for couples & smaller groups, it is perfect for everyone who is interested in capturing a bit of what Prague must have been like at the start of the 20th Century (at the height of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg dynasty, just before the 'Great War').If you are lucky and visit in the evening hours, you will be greatly entertained by the 'Duo Svejk' ('Duo Schweik', as it translates to in German), which is comprised of a very talented musician duo (accordion and bass fiddle) who play & sing traditional Czech period songs, dressed in the Austro-Hungarian Army style of Czech Writer Jaroslav Hasek's beloved character, the 'Good Soldier Svejk'. Even non-singers will be tempted to join in, such is the infectious spirit engendered!The food is excellent, the service superb, the entertainment (by the 'Svejk Duo') contagious and the visual setting is nothing less than stunning. To come here and experience some notable period Czech authenticity is well worth the effort and it might even serve as an introduction to world renown Czech Satirist Jaroslav Hasek's writings (and of course to 'The Good Soldier Svejk' himself). My own introduction to the 'Plzenska Beer Hall Restaurant' came in the course of a Danube Cruise this past October, which included a stopover of several days in this fabulously 'old European' city, and it remains as a highlight among the many excellent sights & experiences to be found in Prague (and there are indeed MANY) today.If you have traveled in Germany and Austria, but are somewhat new to the Czech Republic, this visit will be an experience to enjoy and treasure long afterwards. If you have selected the equally excellent Hotel Yasmin to stay at, you are very close by and well within a short walking distance to the Plzenska Beer Hall Restaurant, as well as historic Wenceslas Square, the Prague State Opera House and many other 'don't miss' Prague experiences (such as the internationally acclaimed City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra).Prices at the Plzenska Beer Hall Restaurant are moderate, but the overall experience is utterly delightful! Don't miss the 'American bar' next door (in the same Prague Municipal House Hall basement) with its unique European Jugendstille decor!)."

Staff did not seem to mind people viewing, when we visited as part of a tour.Menu was acceptable in content and price, and the service was just about acceptable. The surrounding decor and ambience make the eating experience just a little bit difference. Being winter time there was not a problem getting a table at lunch, but I can believe that at busy times it might be a problem. With more than 60 or so tables, I guess the wait would not be too long."

It was quite busy when we arrived but we managed to find a table and ordered 2 hot chocolates from the waiter who seemed very impatient. Hot chocolates arrived quickly with a mini macaroon on the side, a very delicious extra.The building itself and the room the cafe is in is stunning, very 1930s Art Deco style, they still have a dessert trolley that visits all the tables offering a decent selection of intricate looking cakes. It's a lovely touch that adds to the atmosphere of a more glamorous era. However, when it came time to pay our bill we had a lot of trouble getting the attention of a waiter, when we did we were told we had to get the waiter who has originally served us; slightly inconvenient because he was having a in depth conversation with a table that had just arrived. Same thing happened when we came to pay our bill. It's a real shame the service was not up to the standard we were expecting as we'd be reluctant to return or recommend it on this basis."

The host gushed about it and said that it was one of his favorite places in Prague. His \"thumbs up\" worked out well for me, because my husband likes Art Noveau and he was a bit tired of castle and church interiors after almost 3 weeks in Europe.We went on the tour, which I think is the only way to see the building unless you are attending a special event. The tour was well worth it. Every room was stunning. The lighting, decor, and painted ceilings are gorgeous. Some of the ceilings were painted by Alfons Mucha, so if you are a fan of his, do not miss this tour. (Then head across the bridge the next day to see the Slav Epic.)We also paid to see the current Art Noveau exhibit. It was interesting, but I've seen a few Art Noveau exhibits in the past, and this one did not blow me away. So if you are pressed for time, or your feet are tired, I would take the tour of the building and skip the exhibit. Or spend that time going to see the Slav Epic.Our tour tickets included a 2 for 1 beer at the Ameriky Bar on the lower level. If we had been ready for a beer, that would have been a beautiful place to have one. Stop in to see the bar even if you don't decide to sit down and have a drink. If you don't have time for a tour - too bad for you! But consider visiting the Ameriky Bar or one of the two other eating establishments so that you can dine in the Art Noveau splendor."

            "review": "See It All and Save $$ with Combination Admission. You can visit the public spaces here and enjoy looking at some of the stunning art nouveau decor, but it's only the tip of the iceberg. To see it all, buy the combination admission for 450 CZK - $18.80. That modest sum will cover 3 things:1. one-hour English/Czech guided tour to the splendid non-public areas including the Semetana Concert Hall (where you may even glimpse a rehearsal of the Prague Symphony, as we did). 2. entry to the \"Vital Art Nouveau 1900\" exhibition, a luxuriously wide-ranging exploration of the nouveau aesthetic, from decorative and fine arts to film and photography to haute couture gowns and accessories.3. entry to the \"Timeless\" exhibition featuring gowns designed by Blanka Mitragi -- each one a work of highly original and eye-catching art. These things are not to be missed if you want to see the beauty and to feel the pulse of Prague's amazing artistic and cultural heritage. See my pictures from the tour and the Vital Art Nouveau exhibition. Unfortunately, photography was not permitted at the \"Timeless\" exhibition due to the delicacy of the fabrics. But you can take pictures of a few of Mitragi's gowns in Muncipal House's display windows, outside, or you can buy a catalogue at the exhibition (not in English, however).It's best to arrive early -- ticket office opens at 10 AM but people line up from 9 or 9:30 -- and to make sure you know where to meet for the tour and where to find the two exhibits (second floor, up the main staircase, but signs are scarce and staff whom we met did not speak English, so we had to rely on Russian to find our way, even then not easy). After you're set, do take a stroll through the public areas, especially the lower level that has some beautiful tile work on the walls and gilded metalwork enclosing the art nouveau elevator. If the hour is right, do stop by the American Bar, one of the more evocative watering holes in Prague, even if the bartenders are not masters of the cocktail: but you can find something pleasant to drink while drinking in the atmosphere.Municipal House is the home of the Prague Symphony Orchestra, which has four performances scheduled for the famous Smetana Hall in December (9, 10, 16 and 17) for about $20 a ticket: a real bargain, the more so because of the charming intimacy of the hall. We took in the opening performance of the fall season and it was splendid, with some newer, trendier selections along with Dvorak's classic New World Symphony. The experience was sublime and unforgettable. There are other performances as well, so that on any given day you'll probably find an opportunity to enjoy mostly classical music in the great hall. Check in advance and buy tickets early, especially as the holiday season approaches. It's great to see the hall on the tour, but to be there for an actual performance is wonderful to the nth degree.One final note on saving $$. If you are only interested in the guided tour, you will get a 15 percent discount if you present the Prague card. It costs about $52 for 2 days, $63 for 3 days and $73 for 4 days and it covers public transportation from the date/time of first use, gives free admission to many sights and museums, and discounts on others, such as the very popular Mucha Museum. I do not believe it offers a discount on the already discounted combination admission to Municipal House, but you might check on that.If you plan to visit many artistic, cultural, historical or tourist attractions, it probably pays to buy the card. You can get it at the airport, at the Prague City Center and other locations around town. Prague is a great place to visit. IMHO the Municipal House is the best of the best. Do stop by, even if only to visit the public spaces, including the famous bar or one of the two very good cafes, where you can also feast your eyes on original art nouveau decor. There's also a pleasant snack bar combined with ticket office and gift shop that has a nice range of art-nouveau-themed offerings."

Our whole group is Czech in origin; my husband and I live abroad though; our moms travelling with us still live in the Czech Republic.I have always known of Obecni dum, visited many beautiful exhibitions and attended wonderful concerts there, this was the first time for all of us to take the guided house tour and it was just splendid, the interiors are so beautiful, it doesn't matter whether one likes history or design or art - or not, because one looks around and sees amazingly beautiful details, such as air vents (some of them done in gold and all in intricate detailing), furniture, stained glass, wood works, light fixtures - one just appreciates the craftsmanship ( and I for one appreciate that the restoration of this house that was done in the 1990s was done so superbly that today we can admire all those details). For such a big house, I had a feeling of incredible warmth - it felt really nice and \"cozy\" to be in those interiors.......maybe that is the secret of this art nouveau style.I also want to mention the exhibitions going on in Obecni dum till the end of this year that are really worth seeing and a combined ticket can be purchased that works out better pricewise. There is Timeless, the fashion art of Blanka Matragi, a Czech designer who lives in Beirut, Lebanon, and designs mostly for the aristocracy of the Middle East, I was awed by the beautiful embroidery and beading and where she gets inspiration for her designs. There is Secese, Art Nouveau exhibition on the upper floor that shows a little bit of everything from this style - furniture, posters, clothes, glassware and ceramics, but also prints and paintings and explains the main motifs behind art nouveau. And in the hall in front of this exhibition there is a small exhibit of life and costumes of Jarmila Novotna, a major opera diva of Czech origin, who sang in all the biggest venues of the world and made the Metropolitan Opera in New York her home, mostly due to the difficult Czech and European historical events of the 20th century. The main dress of the exhibit was made by the most important Czech fashion house of the pre WWII era, the fashion house Podolska and it is for the first time the public can admire it from so close up, it is a special loan of the Metropolitan.While seeing these exhibitions, one gets to see other spaces of the Municipal House, but don't forget, the cloak room and the toilets are also worth visiting - the whole hose is just beautiful."

There used to be a Royal Palace here till the end of the nineteenth century. This building was completed in 1912 and immediately became the pride of the Republic Square. It gained further prominence when proclamation of the independent state of Czechoslovakia was presented here on the 28th October 1918. The exterior of this building is adorned with beautiful stone filigree, gold embellishments, stained glass windows and artistic frescoes. The interior is decorated with frescoes by Karl Sillar, marble staircases, classy chandeliers and elegant plaster work. The Smetana Concert Hall is a masterpiece in it's own right. It is the venue where the Czech National Symphony Orchestra performs. The building also houses two restaurants, one American bar and a museum."

Some are in English so best to ring up and check the time of these tours. There are other options but they are not worth the money in my opinion. If you do the tour and want to photograph then you need a photographc license which costs 50 crowns ( approx 2 euros). Well worth paying for if you like to photograph and can be bought when you buy your ticket.The tour takes you through at least 7 rooms all spectacularly done out.We thoroughly enjoyed the tour.The address is N\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed Republiky 5."

The art store - located down a short hall from the front entrance, has extremely well done, modestly priced to expensive jewelry, art, toys and other things, many of which you can not find in the souvenir shops. Whether you simply walk around or buy, this is a very high quality shop.The main hall, site of music and other productions, is nice and is the site of frequent productions. The building is located on one of the city's major squares, easily accessible via public transportation and from many hotels. When you consider all that's available in this one building, I'd urge visitors to make this one of the first places to visit in Prague."

This is a very interesting art deco building that hold concerts We had a tour, but things and names seemed to blur after a while.

Definitely stop in here for pastries and a drink."

There are several concert halls and orchestras who take to the stage here.To me, the place feels more like a 'tourist attraction'. Buy a ticket, sometimes on the day and sit on a wooden seat surrounded by other tourists. The acoustics themselves are terrible, as others have mentioned and the reverberations destroy the nuances of any decent classical performance.Your experience will vary depending on which orchestra is playing. Be warned, they are not all the same. One of the nights i visited was bad enough I walked out. An amateur performance at best, there was simply no cohesion nor emotion conveyed, with more than several wrong notes. I suppose it also reflects the price, with most tickets under 1000 Koruna. I do however recommend the Czech Philharmonic. They are amongst the world's best 25 orchestras."

However, while the overall hall might have been air conditioned this room was not. It was unbearably hot. So go for the music, the ambience and the experience, but don't go on a super hot day unless you are prepared to melt."

On my third trip to Prague, I finally managed to find time for the Municipal House tour, and it was one of my favorite things in Prague. They only have a few tours a day, so my mom and I went to the box office in the morning to get tickets (not right when they opened, and it was high tourist season), but I think others had no problem buying tickets right beforehand. Our tour was large but not ludicrously so, and conducted in Czech and English, which meant there was plenty of time to take photos during the other language.Photo tickets DO cost extra, which in my experience is common for museums and other attractions in post-Soviet countries. It's not an expensive extra fee, and we only had to purchase one for both of us (we confirmed this with the guide before the tour started).The guide was knowledgeable and pleasant - not the kind of almost manic-funny guide you get on tip-based \"free walking tours,\" but well-informed and good. The interior of the building is gorgeous and I enjoyed learning more about Art Nouveau. I'm a little puzzled by those complaining that the \"mall\" \"across the street\" instantly ruined the experience, as I don't recall noticing a mall and was busy looking at the stunning interiors of Municipal House itself. Overall, it was one of my favorite experiences in Prague, but I really enjoy architecture and history.If you're less interested in architecture and history, you can wander around the basement and some of the ground floor and peek into the restaurants for free, although it's less impressive.I would avoid both the restaurants and bars, which look incredibly overpriced (I'm guessing the \"two for one\" drink coupon with the tour brings the drinks closer to normal prices) and the concerts, which like all concerts marketed to tourists in Prague are a ripoff. If you're visiting in the off-season, there should be plenty of better options, and in summer I'd personally rather no concert than a low-quality overpriced concert."

The first time I visited the building, I ran around like a child in a toyshop, taking phtographs all over the ground floor and the floor below, where there is the beautiful American Bar and a 3-D model of the building. My husband and I had drinks and an early dinner in the Kavarna Cafe. I had the salmon dinner; it was good and reasonably priced. All the while we were there, someone was playing lovely tunes on the piano. The spectacular architecture, the food and the music all combined to make this my peak Prague experience. I returned two days later for another visist. I did not see a concert or take a guided tour on either visit. However, on my second visit, I bought a ticket to the Art Nouveau exhibit on the floor above the ground floor. While I was up there, I peeked into Smetana Hall - a gorgeous venue. The exhibit was interesting, too. I also visited the gift shop which has some unusual art nouveau items (on the expensive side) as well as postcards and more affordable objets. If you decide to attend a concert, make sure it is in Smetana Hall. Some concerts are held in smaller venues of the Municipal House. If I had had more time, I would have also taken one of the guided tours. Don't miss this special Prague sight."

But by far the best part of the Municipal House is the cake in the cafe at street level!"

From the huge auditorium, through the amazing Restaurants that flank the entrance to the American Bar and beer cellar below, this whole complex is a triumph of the Art Deco style, and also of Czech nationalism as it was built immediately post World War 1 when Czechoslovakia was given independence. To begin or end a visit, you should take a drink or a meal in either one of the two Art Deco restaurants included in the site, for an experience of early twentieth century grandeur. The only downside to the guided tout we took was the knowledgeable but rather formidable guide, who bit the head off of unsuspecting visitors who \"stepped out of line\"! Seemed a bit of a throw back to the school headmistress, very much the old school variety"

Still very nice and a great experience. You don't have to dress up. There's a mall right there and some restaurants, so it's super easy to do a little shopping, grab a bite to eat and see some music, then walk back to your hotel if you're in the area. I was really glad I'd booked this in advance. Recommend it if you enjoy symphonic music."

I bought many beautiful silk scarves for gifts, made in the Czech Republic and with patterns by Mucha (the famous Art Deco artist). Walking around the tourist zone in Prague, you are constantly bombarded with people handing out ads for music performances by small chamber orchestras of a sort of greatest classical hits in lesser venues. This building has the famous Smetana Hall, with over the top opulence. We listened to the Prague Symphonic Orchestra perform Symphony Number 9 by Schubert and selections by Wagner, including arias from Tannhauser sung by bass-baritone Adam Plachetka. The price to hear such a high level of artistic quality in such a wonderful venue was less than the cost to go to the ones hawked by the street vendors!

It was designed by Mucha, and if you want to get an appreciation of him, visit the Mucha Museum (which is close by). He was a Czech nationalist, but also an artist of international renown at the turn of the 20th century. We went to it and there was an exhibition inside of the art nouveau movement which was excellent, featuring arts and crafts of the turn of the century. I did not see as one reviewer did any 'shopping center' but there is a concert hall which we could not visit. There are two restaurants in it but we did not have time to eat in them.

The seats themselves are quite uncomfortable and small; the boxes aren't as large as they appear on the website. Further, there aren't any clear signs indicating where the seat is, my ticket said 'Box 2' but even the staff there couldn't tell me exactly where the seat was. (Hint: it was the balcony, and there's a little plaque with 'II' on it). The good part is that there isn't a dress code, even though the Prague locals do like to get dressed for this, so expect to see plenty of well dressed people but you won't stand out too much as there are still tourists in the mix."

Prague has lots of beautiful Art Nouveau scattered around the city, but this is most definitely the highlight. The building is stunning, inside and out, beautifully restored. We took a one hour tour, which took us through the big music hall, and then through half a dozen side rooms, each individually decorated. The best was the one decorated by Alphons Mucha, but they were all lovely in their own way. The tour guide was excellent, told us many things about the history of the building and what some of the motifs in the decoration mean. One of the side rooms is where the first Czech Republic was declared after the first world war, so the tour is worth it just to see that, if you are interested in history. There were also two exhibitions on, and we bought a combined ticket for these and for the tour (if you want to take photos on the tour, ask for a photo permit, which is not much more money but which the staff fail to mention to anyone that you require). The exhibition of Art Nouveau objects was gorgeous, absolutely worth a visit, glassware, furniture, jewellery and some stunning clothing. The second exhibition, of dresses by a Czech designer, we could not find, and none of the staff we asked seemed to know where it was; but her shop is on the ground floor of the building, so we saw enough in the window that we decided not to bother looking harder. There are also a cafe, a restaurant and a bar on site. We visited both the cafe and the restaurant on successive days, mostly so that we could sit and admire the amazing decor. The cafe prices were not bad at all, perhaps a bit higher, but not as much as you might expect. The restaurant is quite a lot more expensive, and geared very much to serious meals, not coffee and cake. Aside from the excellent tour guide, the service from everyone in the building (ticket office, cafe and restaurant) was uniformly terrible, but I love the building so much I can't mark it down for that!There are lifts, but finding someone who can operate them for you seemed to be extremely difficult, so if you have mobility issues it might be worth allowing extra time. All of the bathrooms I saw were up sets of stairs, also."

Actually the building itself is very nice, and it was marvelous how empty it was - as if we were on a secret mission without anyone knowing about us. And then, the exhibition. If you're not particularly in love with secession and art deco, I don't think it would be worth the 150 CZK-s, but if you happen to like this period (as I do, and I grabbed along my two exhausted parents), you couldn't be in a better place. A very pretty exhibition, easily worth a thin hour of your time, with all the interactivity and videos, pieces of clothing and interior design. And the posters! Amazing! Nota bene: this show is not for those who wish to see all the original pieces from all the big names put together. Also nota bene: the gift shop is disappointing (even though I would have been into buying any Mucha-themed stuff."

However, I must point out that although one can see beautiful elements in the foyer, reception areas, and exterior, you do not get a true feel for this structure unless you take the tour. It's worth the ticket price, easily, and supports the preservation of the structure, so don't hesitate. Take the tour! If you are a Mucha fan or have come to Prague to see as much of Mucha's work as possible, you won't be able to go home until you experience the Mayor's salon, only available on the tour. I have uploaded five photos which I took during the guided tour. Spectacular does not even come close to describing this architectural treasure. I'd also like to point out that our guide's English was excellent! We visited over the Easter holidays and were able to walk in and purchase tickets w/out a wait. However, I am sure that in the summer it gets very busy, so I would advise booking ahead.The website describes the building as a national treasure, one representing the \"golden age of Art Nouveau.\" This is certainly the case! I visited Prague twice before without venturing further than the front door and, having just seen as much of the building as is open to the public, I regret waiting this long. This building will change how you see Prague - it's a \"must see\" for any visitor."

You'll need to buy a release to take photos, not a bad price at 55 CZK. The artwork and architecture is beautiful and the history of the building is interesting. We went on the tour specifically as INXS filmed their 'New Sensation' video here. It was great to see the balcony in real life, although you can't go out onto it.After the tour we had a drink in the American bar (2 for 1 with your tour ticket on certain drinks). I then asked where the toilets were and was pointed in the direction of the restaurant by the helpful bar staff. However when trying to get to it I was stopped by the Maitre D and told that the toilets were for 'their clients only' and the public toilets were upstairs. So I went upstairs where another gentleman told me that the toilets 'are not for free'. He begrudgingly let me go through after I showed him my tour ticket.Now I appreciate that as a historic building they don't want hundreds of people traipsing through using the toilets on a daily basis but they didn't have to be so rude about it. These two gentlemen really spoiled the experience for me, so I probably won't go back if I ever visit Prague again."

Hadn't realised he was Czech - what a great artist he was. The main hall (great for concerts) is utterly beautiful. The design isn't the flowing, naturalistic Art Nouveau that we English relish, but is equally beautiful, Go downstairs to the American Bar (the oldest bar in Prague) and note the tiles on the stair walls. The restaurants either side of the main entrance hall are free to enter, so if you see nothing else, you MUST see those.

The Municipal House is a beautiful building, both on the inside and outside. I bought my ticket earlier in the day, and was offered a 950 czk seat for 750 czk, and seats at the back of the hall were available for a reduced price of 500czk. Upon arriving you are free to choose a seat within your designated area, so may be worth arriving early to ensure the best view. Although the front half of the seating area was fairly busy the back half was relatively bare, possibly because tickets weren't particularly cheap, so some visitors who had purchased the cheapest tickets moved forward once everyone else was seated. The concert itself was very enjoyable with an excellent piano performance, and my only real gripe would be that the seats were quite uncomfortable towards the end of the hour long performance. Overall though it was an enjoyable performance in a classy venue."

We asked whether we could move and told this was fine unless anyone else had those tickets. No chance! Out of about 2,000 seats I would say less than a quarter were occupied, and most of those the cheaper ones at the back. Nevertheless the concert was excellent. A string octet giving an absolutely faultless performance of favourites - Mozart, Vivaldi, Handel were featured among others. And the building is indeed extremely beautiful.

My wife and I decided on the spur of the moment to attend a concert of the Prague Music Chamber Orchestra who were playing some classical music by composers such as Bach, Mozart, Pachelbel, Dvorak and Strauss. The municipal building is beautiful and very ornate and you can join a guided tour for \u20ac7. The concert was in the basement area beside the American Bar and the Pilsen Restaurant. The restaurant is very authentic (and large) but we didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food. The concert lasted about 1 hour. The audience was relatively small, about 80 - 100 people, but the music was very good and in such surrounding was very intimate. Overall it was a lovely, unexpected experience and highly recommend if you like classical music and even if you don't the Chamber Orchestre were skilled musicians."

We initially went to see the Mucha interior and it was certainly stunning. But the rest of the rooms were similarly perfect. The tour was not expensive and well worth it. Excellent coffee - cocktails too - in the American Bar if you can't face another beer, a beer-cellar type restaurant in the basement and ground floor cafe next to the entrance.

Since it was last minute, we booked it through a helpful and patient lady at the tourist helpdesk near the astronomical clock in old town. We chose Beethoven & Mozart, since the opera would be in Czech and we didn't want to get into subtitles. So we booked 2 tickets for 800 czk each.Municipal House is a beautiful building, both inside and out. Our first brush with western classical music was an experience to remember. Being trained in Indian Hindustani classical music myself, I was trying to follow the notes and connect them with our \"raga\"s here. The musicians had a very high level of mastery over the notes and the instruments. One cannot help but go into a trance.Just a little disappointment- the wooden chairs were uncomfortable. They reminded me of our wooden benches, the kind we sat on in school! Maybe they need to come up with some more comfortable options for a better experience. That is the only reason that I'm giving 4 stars."

The building and hall are very lovely, apparently the most important Art Deco building in Prague. The concert was very enjoyable, the musicians skilled and the selection of music was tasteful and varied. We were under the impression when booking that it would be a full orchestra, but it was actually an all string instrument concert, 8 musicians altogether. This was a slight disappointment, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. When we got there most people immediately stood in a queue to check in coats and bags ( which they charge 8 crown per item to check in, so bring change). We checked our things, but I later discovered that some people kept their things with them in the hall, and by doing so they avoided standing in the long line afterwards to collect their things...I'd keep my stuff with me next time.. The concert was about 1 hour long, not bad, but the 1260 crowns per ticket ( about \u00a345 ) was a little steep for such a short activity I think."

My partner had a rich chocolate slice with ganache and nougat, whilst I had a traditional honey cake that could not have been tastier. The two slices of cake and milkshakes came to 380ck about \u00a311.50 which is a similar price for this sort of thing back home in a cake shop, without the pianist and historical building, so good value.The building is beautiful, inside and out. During our cake and milkshake there was a pianist playing which was wonderful, a tradition that I love."

I have not taken a tour, but remember it quite well, especially the concert hall and ballroom. Years ago, growing up in Prague, it was very trendy and fashionable for high school kids to take ballroom dancing lessons there.The highlight for the \"fortunate\" kids living in Prague was a prom in this building's ballroom. It was amazing:) ...and one of the few \"luxuries\" tolerated by the communist party. I am very grateful that the restoration of the building was done so beautifully and that people from all over the world can appreciate its beauty and the artistic skills of the czech nation.Municipal House was the location of the Czechoslovak Declaration of Independence signed in October 1918."

I'll never forget the sensation of standing in that choir loft, looking out on that great audience, surrounded by majestic sculpture, friezes and stained glass. The acoustics were astonishing, and in the end, our approximately 1,000 audiences members (on a Tuesday night in July!) gave us a an eight-minute standing ovation. If you are a musician who ever has a chance to perform here - grab it with both hands. Whether a musician or not, go and hear a performance. Like Vienna, Prague is a city of great music and it just doesn't get any better than Smetana Hall."

The French Restaurant is not cheap (eg. \u00a330 for a bottle of Chilean Sauvignon Blanc, c\u00a320 for a main course and they don't serve tap water). The surroundings are lovely, the food well-presented but alas not quite up to the standard one expects at those prices. The waiters are, in typically French-style, slightly over-assertive and impatient. On the evening we dined, the clientele seemed to be predominantly tourists. Presumably well-heeled locals will take their custom to less tourist-oriented establishments."

There are at least two performances most evenings, some classical some more contemporary. The Smetena performance hall is a reasonable size, but except for side box seats which are slightly elevated, the rest of the seats sit on a flat floor. This can make viewing the stage a bit of a challenge if there is a relatively full house although it was not crowded during our stay. Seats are hard and can be uncomfortable even for an hour- long performance."

They were brilliant seats!!On to the orchestra - strings, bass, piano, percussion, clarinet, flute bassoon..Music from Once Upon A Time In The West, Pearl Harbour, Romeo & Juliet, Forrest Gump, Jurassic Park, Les Miserables, Moulin Rouge, Evita & Titanic to name a few.The Orchestra were highly professional and played superbly, especially fantastic playing from the lady in the teal dress on violin!! The room - Smetana Hall -is beautiful. 1200 seats, ornate decoration, sculptures and paintings accompanied by brilliant acoustics.

You can buy tix online or in person.Be prepared to pay for a photo privileges pass if you want to take photos. I would suggest this. We had expected to find postcards with good photos of the place, but there were none.Until December 2014, there is also a special exhibit, called Essential Art Nouveau, in the upstairs. they have many items from the museum of decorative arts.

Go to the American Bar in the basement, the tourist restaurant in the basement is vast and serves tradtional Czeck cusine. There is also a beer hall on the right of the American Bar. The French Restarant is worth peeking in, we had coffee and cake late one night in the other restaurant on the first floor, also a fanstastic interior! There was a special Art Nouveau exhibit which was excellent in two exhibition spaces. Very well done, All of the interpretation was in Czeck and English. The catalogue looked great but extreemly expensive. All the good Art Nouveau textiles, ,posters, glass, ceramics,furnitute paintings, sliver and other consumer goods came from the Museum of Decorative Art for this show, so there were only a few pieces of Art Nouveau left to see at the Museum. It will take you a couple of days to see the whole of this spectacular building."

Instead, we were shuffled downstairs into the basement and then into a small room that held maybe 75 people in vinyl covered stackable chairs. The performers and the concert itself were OK (though the concert was slightly less than one hour long), but we felt VERY mislead. The photos depicted a magnificent auditorium, not our basement room. Before you make a purchase, make sure you know what you're getting into. I would highly recommend NOT wasting your money to go to Municipal House Hall if you're expecting a true concert-hall experience."

I have to admit I just went along with her but I believe my experience is an honest reflection. After buying the tickets we were left to wait in a gift shop, call me cynical but no surprise to me. The guide arrived late and was pretty rude and abrasive. She explained that if we wished to take photos we would need to pay an additional charge. Throughout the tour this lady seemed very vigilant in her policing of \"unauthorised\" photography, sometimes it seems at the expense of the tour. The tour itself was completed at a brisk pace, to be honest she didn't take a breath, talked relentlessly and even told one older couple to \"be quiet and listen to me \".The tour finished in a cafe/restaurant which was overpriced, dingy and staffed by uninterested employees. On a positive note we met some nice Scottish people. It's an impressive building but unfortunately it's been turned into a rather unprofessionally run tourist trap."

There is a concert every night (sometimes two). They are all just an hour long and provide a variety of choices. There are many fine selections of classical music, performed by talented musicians. We tried a few but also attended one that featured Hollywood Movie music. Its the performers and the outstanding acoustics that we came to see and hear.If you buy tickets at the facility, be aware that they also sell tickets to other venues and on one occasion we were steered to a \"box office window\" that was selling tickets for other performances. That day, tickets to the performance we chose, being performed at SMETANA Hall at this facility was being sold at a table next to the box office. As long as you know what you want, there won't be a problem getting the right tickets.The performances that we attended were never full - we always got our tickets the day of or day before. Its a hall, not a theater, so you will not find inclined seating and therefore may not be able to see the stage sometimes. You can easily just move to another seat. There is usually quite a few open seats on the sides.The restaurants were quite nice. A Caf\u00e9 and a French restaurant are on the ground floor level. Downstairs you will find the America Bar (second oldest in Europe) and the Pilsen Restaurant. We stopped in the Pilsen after one of the concerts but unfortunately couldn't stay to hear the accordionist or enjoy the Czech food - looked like a fun group; a definite choice for next time."

The 8-piece orchestra was professional, the acoustics excellent. But there was no special feeling of elation, no rapport with the audience and it felt like this was something the musicians did for summer money. The prices were definitely for tourists and the audience was indeed entirely tourists. The cheapest tickets were 750 CZK whereas Czech friends told me they would pay that kind of price for a full performance for the most expensive tickets. We were there in July when the Czech Philharmonic is on its break. What it was was 60 minutes exactly of well-known classical melodies. The hall in July was almost empty. If the charge had been half as much, the hall might have been full.The most expensive tickets are 1590 CZK and there is just no point. The seats are hardly any distance apart from each other, the seats are all very uncomfortable (wooden) so if you want to go, for an opportunity to see the hall and experience a pleasant concert, I'm happy to recommend the lowest price - we didn't do that but saw there was hardly any difference between the rows our seats were in and the lower prices. This was why I gave it an \"average\" score - the shortness of the performance and the price compared to Czech prices but again, I reiterate, not to retract from the beautiful hall and first-class musicians."

That gave me the opportunity to explore the building before and after the event. It is a visual treat. Take time to look around and make note of the way all of the design elements work together in this showstopper of a building. The concert featured the Prague Music Orchestra. If you get a chance to hear one of this group's performances, be sure that you do!"

No performer required a microphone that is so common today with our untrained singers. That is how pitch perfect this art hall is compared to newer building. Shows change daily and are affordable. Get your ticket the day of and don't worry about hearing or seeing the stage. I wish when I first arrived in country I had bought tickets for every night!"

We visited lots of cities, many of which with considerable Art Nouveau roots. By far, Prague was our favorite Art Nouveau city and the Municipal House was our favorite Art Nouveau destination in Prague. If you are a fan of Art Nouveau, make sure you budget to spend some time here. We would highly recommend the tour of the facility, which for a small fee you get a guided tour to see many of the rooms and grandure of the Municipal House ... including the Mucha room. I took so many pictures I thought I was going to max out our camera's memory card! Also, there are at least 4 restaurants inside the Municipal house that you can visit, have a bite, and take in the ambiance. If you are strapped for cash, a good amount of the Municipal House is available for free or the cost of a drink or bite in the restaurants. However, we loved the tour too."

At short notice I went to a performance by the Prague Chamber Orchestra in the Smetana Hall in the art nouveau Municipal House. It was a popular program aimed at tourists - Eine kleine nachtmusik and Vivaldi's Four Seasons. It was nice to hear this beuatiful music again, played with precision and vigor. The only oddity was the audience who applauded after every movement. Is this a Prague thing or an indication that the patrons were new to the concert hall? The Municipal House is brilliant. Next time I am in Prague I will go on a tour. The building was designed by Balsanek and Polivka and incorporates stained glass and mosaics by notable artists including Alphonse Mucha. There is a beautiful restaurant as well. It looks quite expensive but has lunchtime specials."

The exterior, with its mosaic of Prague as a lady, is just a foretaste of what's inside. My friend and I spent several hours exploring the place, which is not a government office building but an architectural expression of Czech pride built at great cost in a nationalistic fervor against Austro-Hungarian occupation. You can be enthralled by the elevators, stairwells, tile work, etc. even if you do not spring for the tour. Make sure to go downstairs to the bars below to see the wall fountain and admire the architectural elements. I spent $25 US to go on the tour, go into the Art Nouveau special exhibit (two amazing rooms, from furniture and posters to dresses, including the painful undergarments required to squeeze into the dresses), and buy the photo pass necessary to take photos during the tour. And it was WORTH the cost. The tour takes you into the Smetana Hall (which you can see for free if you attend a concert there), the ladies' and men's salons featuring matching patterns in the lace draperies, furniture, and walls, a breathtaking room of Mucha murals of important moments in Czech history, and a large hall with really cool chandeliers. This feeble attempt to describe the glories of the Municipal Hall cannot come close to dong justice to it. There is also a nice gift shop, Modernista, which offers books on art nouveau and nice pieces by contemporary artists. The French restaurant just off the entrance looks wonderful from the outside, but seemed awful pricey to me."

First floor contains a luxury restaurant with a nice menu and a caf\u00e9 for more pedestrian fare. I did not attend a show but they have regular concerts. Lovely!"

Asked our guide for English one but was told it's not available because tour would be in English. But there were times we couldn't hear at the back of other people. Asked specific question but the guide was very annoyed and rude. So no more questions and we all felt so uncomfortable for the rest of the tour. At the end we were told to go downstairs at the bar and show the tickets to get drinks for discount price. We went down with the rest of the people on the tour, and we were turned down by the again rude waiters for not having the righr tickets. We were the only ones turned down and basically they said this piece of paper is meaningless. Well, that's the online ticket for the tour we got in advance! We felt embarrassed when everyone else was going in to the bar. So went upstairs to complain but was told the same thing. Felt very discriminated. Would give five star for the beautiful historical building but one for the most unpleasant experience we ever had."

The orchestra was rehearsing in the beautiful main hall. The cafe/brasserie: a lovely interior but smelled of school dinners, and having planned to eat in the elegant main restaurant were 'greeted' by an incredibly rude man (no wonder they only had four diners), so returned to our favourite Cafe Slavia. The cocktail bar in the basement also worth a visit. The vast empty cloakroom awaiting 500 coats is a wonderful image and quite as interesting an interior as any of the art nouveau flourishes throughout the building."

I subtract one point for a somewhat familiar approach on his part - that sits ill with the style of the place! Also, as in the cafeteria, service may feel a bit slow at times. The cafeteria (on the left as you enter through the main doors) is likewise period perfect and classy. The chocolate excellent. Service has a touch of old-style communist times in being slow - however, that almost feels like positive nostalgia in this place... as long as the quality is so good otherwise.

Although we both like classical music it was the first time we had listened to it live and 'up close and personal' and it was certainly no disappointment,Whilst there were only 8 musicians playing their music easily filled the hall and the acoustics meant that you could pick out the individual instruments which added to the experience for the pair of us.The hall itself is beautifully decorated and it must be quite a sight when all the seats are full and listening to a full orchestra."

Anyone interested in modern art styles and architecture, particularly that of the late 19th and early 20th century, will be amazed by the exuberant Municipal House, one of the most iconic landmarks of the Czech capital and indeed one of the finest buildings in all of Europe. Located on Republic Square (public transport: Namesti Republiky metro station, line B), it is situated on the former grounds of King\u2019s Court, of which the adjacent late gothic Powder Gate is the only remnant. It was built between 1905-1911 and celebrated its centennial anniversary in November 2012. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this architectural jewel earlier this year. The building is a grand example of Art Nouveau, harmoniously blending other styles en vogue during that very creative period, especially Neo\u00adBaroque, Neo\u00adRenaissance and even elements of Art Deco.I took a guided tour in English which was very informative and well worth the admission fee. The highlights were the magnificent Smetana Hall, Prague\u2019s largest concert hall, and the sumptuous Mayor\u2019s Hall, decorated by Art Nouveau designer and key figure Alfons Mucha. I regret not having attended a concert, as the acoustics of the concert hall are superb. There are many strong historical connections, most notably the proclamation of an independent Czechoslovak Republic in the Smetana Hall in October 1918. Access to the lobby and the ground floor areas is free of charge. There is a stylish French restaurant on the right (Francouszka Restaurace) and an equally impressive Municipal House Caf\u00e9 on the left, buzzing with tourists and locals, attracted by its atmospheric d\u00e9cor, delicious breakfasts and decadent cakes. Both the Caf\u00e9 and the French restaurant are a feast of Art Nouveau, boasting high ceilings, large windows and mirrors and elaborate period chandeliers with lots of crystal and gold.From the lobby you can go down a large staircase \u2013 with beautiful ceramic tiles on the walls- leading to the swanky American Bar \u2013claiming to be Prague\u2019s oldest bar- and to the \u201cPilsen Restaurant\u201d (Plzenska Restaurace) decorated like a German beer hall, serving an outstanding Pilsen beer. The elegant ground floor restaurant offers refined French dining (fine seafood, escargots and foie gras among other delicacies), while the more popular Pilsen restaurant downstairs is a hearty, traditional Czech food affair, often with live music. I had lunch in the latter and can confirm that the food was excellent and the waiters were prompt and friendly. Apart from a permanent exhibition displaying a copy of St Wenceslas crown (the original being kept at Prague Castle), the Municipal House is host to various temporary exhibitions, currently the most notable being \u201cVital Art Nouveau 1900\u201d, showcasing a selection of the most remarkable masterpieces of European and Czech Art Nouveau (open daily 10 am \u2013 7 pm, admission 150 CZK, discounts for children, students and seniors).There are daily concerts, mostly classical music performed by the Prague Philharmonic and Classic Orchestra, but also Opera with Ballet and even Jazz. Guided tours in English and Czech (90 min) are scheduled on a regular basis in the afternoon, costing CZK 290 (\u00a3 8.80 / $ 14.50 / \u20ac 10.60), with a 15% discount for Prague Card holders (www.prague.fm/12488/prague-discount-card). Please check the official website for the latest schedule (www.obecnidum.cz/en/). The admission price included a token exchangeable for a drink in the American Bar downstairs. You certainly won't be disappointed visiting the Municipal House (on your next stay) in Prague, but please plan enough time to attend a concert ! Marius C. Berger, MDLondon, UK"

There are a number of rooms (or parlours) that can be hired for private events although our guide said the rooms were expensive. You do have to pay a fee to take photographs in the Hall, but there are some stunning examples of art work and decoration. Well worth the visit. The Cafe downstairs has the most fabulous cakes and coffee and is certainly good value."

We first went into the Prague Municipal House to book tickets for an early evening concert, then decided to indulge with coffee and cream cakes in the Kavarna, which were dellghtful, as were the surroundings, which included a jazz group playing. The next day we went to the concert in the small concert hall and enjoyed a concert of chamber music. After the concert, we decided to splash out on a meal in the Francouzska restaurant in the building. The meal was superb with a really good Czech wine recommended by the wine waiter. On the third day we reurned to the Kaverna for the set lunch before leaving Prague. The price of the meals in the Kaverna were modest and those in the Francouska were expensive, but it was a very enjoyable experience to go to such an iconic Czech institution. The building with it's Art Nouveau features, was truly magnificent."

We took a guided tour which focused more on the art presented in the building, which is absolutely beautiful and meaningful and made us want to get know more about Alfons Mucha, who drew many of the pictures. Many of the people visiting didn't speak English and were walking with the group reading the material in their native language, which can make the tour a bit \"dead\", but I guess it depends on the specific group. I also think the tour could relate more to the history of the building. Yet again- highly recommended for art and/or architecture enthusiasts."

They also have concerts there but just be mindful that it may not be in the main hall, which is the impressive one.You also need to buy a 'photo' pass in order to take photos during the tour. I think it was 300czk for the tour + 100 for the photo. As it is still a fully functional hall, tour availability may be limited and changes a lot. I think they try to have 1-2 tours/day if there is nothing booked. The tour last for 1 hour and is done in English. Other languages I saw people holding a manuscript instead.This place is literally adjoining the powder gates so you cannot miss it.

Nowhere else can you see this style in all it's expressions, from plaster work, to iron work, frescoes, lighting, painting, wood work and tile. The tilework is particularly significant. Produced by the \"Rako\" company out of Rakovnik, it covers floors and walls in the entrance and basement floor of the building. Go to the basement and for a sublime experience of art noveau tile murals, go into the Plzenska Restaurace. You can see a virtual tour online at http://www.virtualtravel.cz/praha/stare-mesto/obecni-dum/plzenska-restaurace.html. Smetana Hall is also worth a visit, although for architectural buffs, it is a bit of a hash of styles, overdone with nationalistic fervor. But what an exuberant, fantastical building, testament to an exuberant period in Prague's history."

The interior is decorated with the works of the best Czech artist from the first decade of the 20th century.

It is right next to the Powder Tower. You can also book a concert there. There are different concert spaces including the Smetena hall that takes 1200 people. We went for an early evening classical concert by the Bohemian Symphony orchestra in the Gregre Hall. This isn't a huge concert hall and massive orchestra - it was an all string ensemble in a smallish, artistically embellished room but they did a great job with tailored arrangements of popular classics - Dvorak, Mozart and Gershwin. It started at 18.00 - and was only about an hour in length. Cost 800CSZ. Not cheap but worth the money for the whole experience. I might have been upset if I had paid the higher price of 1000 CSZ - as the acoustics and seating and size of room did not justify this differentiation. You might want to take a cushion as they were rows of hard wooden chairs. It depends on your degree of personal built in padding! Overall it was a delightful musical taster of Prague in an appropriate setting."

The city burghers knew what they were doing when they employed the pre-eminent Czech architects and artists of the day to design and decorate their town hall. Outside it is impressive but the inside - the best bits only seen if you take a guided tour - are stunning. Buy a ticket in advance on the day to avoid disappointment as numbers are restricted because some of the once official rooms are quite small. It is, however, licensed for weddings if you want an unusual venue! You have to buy a permit to take photos on the tour.A tour ticket gets you a 2-4-1 deal on drinks in the American Bar downstairs - well worth drinking up the atmosphere, especially in the little curtained booths either side of the bar. What secrets could they tell?Ten years ago I ate wonderful traditional Czech food with good service in the Beer Hall beside the bar. Not so in 2013. We tried to book a table but were told this could only be done via hotel or travel agent and that we would have no problem getting a table even though we were eating on a Saturday. Sure enough, no tables available at 7pm. We complained to the same waiter that we'd tried to book and he reluctantly sat us down opposite the main entrance - happily with a good view of the lovely original tiled picture walls.I was a bit suspicious of the food when I saw the menu where dishes were pictured - a trick supposedly to appeal to tourists - rather than simply in text. The range was much less than I recalled and, having had dumplings eariier in the day, chose smoked pork with potato pancake and plum sauce rather than the roast duck I'd had my heart on. The pork turned out to be three fatty slices and the pancake looked like a cowpat. I cut out the lean meat, doused it in plum sauce and left the rest. No response from the waitress who asked how the food had been when I said mine was very greasy.Go in and take pictures but eat elsewhere."

You can go into the entrance hall, see the caf\u00e9 and restaurant, walk downstairs to see the American Bar and restaurant too, and there are so many fabulous features to see it took my breath away. It's a must see for Art Nouveau fans.Where it falls down for me is that you have to pay to see a performance to go into the main auditorium, and that the caf\u00e9 lacks atmosphere. This was my second visit to the caf\u00e9 - the first for an evening meal, this time for breakfast. Outside on the terrace was more interesting than inside - it seems that they have a lot of space to fill and not enough customers to make it inviting. Both visits were in September - maybe it fills up in the winter?The breakfast menu was uninspiring - fine but not very interesting. I have to say the service was very good, but you paid for the environment. We had much better - and cheaper - breakfasts at Caf\u00e9 Louvre."

Poor bar tender - one concert finishes, one due to start, and he is on his own making cocktails ! He is falling behind..... So on to the concert - the building is impressive on the outside and the inside too. Unfortunately, the rows of seats were incredibly uncomfortable ( I think it was so that you were happy to leave without noticing how short the performance was ). The ensemble consisted of 6 violinists, one double bass, and a cello. The sound and quality of playing was excellent, covering all those tunes from advertisements that we know and love! Some where very brief , and so was the whole performance - 55 minutes , which at prices from \u00a328 to \u00a336 can only be seen as expensive ( being charitable) or a rip off ( being cynical), you choose. I cannot recommend that you spend your hard earned money on such a performance and you may be better going to see a complete rendition."

My main complaint was that the exhibit was up three flights of stairs and I have trouble with stairs. So I asked for an elevator. The only elevator has an attendant who refused to let me ride up in it since my disability was not obvious. So I painfully made my way up the stairs. At the top, the two ticket takers saw how painful it was for me and indicated that I could have taken the elevator..... Enough said."

The interior is beautiful for pictures but I rather tip the guide than pay for the photo taking which is just another rip off tourist opportunity. The tour is an hour long but feels much way shorter. If you can, a concert here must be really great, we couldn't with a 14month baby and 6 year old in tow. The Smetana hall is simply breath-taking. The is a room with amazing acoustics which the guide will explain. Do make sure you try it. Tickets are sold for the day of visit but do buy your tickets at the time after a tour has started for the next ones to avoid unnecessary long queues, i.e there is a tour at 11am, buy your ticket after this time for 1pm or 4pm tours. The office opens at 10am and the queue in the morning is very long. Sundays tours are in different timing, do check. If you have kids, make sure that they can be kept quiet (or not overtired) as any sound is amplified in those rooms making it very hard for the crowd to hear the guide. But of course if you step away to the next room it would be fine but you'll miss the tour yourself. We also attended the Mucha exhibit within the same building. Interesting but I'm really not a fan of Mucha."

Alphons Mucha was an early 1900s Art Nouveau artist. The hotel clerk felt that the exhibition was better than the museum and we were glad we went. The exhibition has over 100 Mucha prints and is very interesting. The price was 180 Crowns per person, which was pretty reasonable for Prague. The art was very interesting to look at and the descriptions helped. Also there was an interesting 20 minute movie. it runs through early September. We highly recommend you go!"

But the 12-13 piece chamber orchestra that played for us was very good and the violin soloist was excellent. You forget how great it is to be able to hear and see the performers live. The hall itself is very very beautiful. We were in Prague on a tour and many of our group went to see the Czech Black Light Theatre \"because it is only found in the Czech Republic\".

The Municipal House is a historic building, located next to the Powder Tower on N\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed Republiky that is handsomely decorated in Art Nouveau architectural style. The building facade features a very nice Homage to Prague mosaic and there is quite a bit more to see and experience inside. Within the Municipal House complex, you can find much more Art Nouveau decor, a couple of classy restaurants, an atmospheric cafe, historical Americky Bar and a beautiful Smetana Hall. During our recent visit to Prague we visited the Municipal House to watch a short concert in one of the minor halls, located next to Americky Bar in the basement area of the building. The performance was decent, the acoustics not great but the entire experience made better simply by the architecture and decor of the building. Overall, not sure we'd return for a minor concert performance or not but would certainly be interested in attending a performance in the major Smetana Hall and would be delighted to attend a tour of this building, which we found to be a real treat for fans of Art Nouveau architectural style."

You can go inside and buy tickets for the same day or some time during your visit. Vivaldi is a common theme. We returned that evening for an octet of violins and strings, accompanied by one of Prague's opera stars. It was a great performance, and you get to hear how good the Hall is for music and opera. The show was 70 minutes and was not at all expensive, less than $100 for 2 for great seats."

Our guide Pavla was so friendly and enthusiastic (and very kindly gave an abbreviated German translation of the tour to a small group that was on the tour). You could tell that she genuinely loved the building, and with good reason. A real monument to the pride and artistry of the Czech people during the pre-WWI boom time. The Ivan Lendl:Alfons Mucha exhibit was on display while we were there, and was also amazing. A huge collection of one of the most important Czech artists, beautiful art deco posters, well-curated with an informative video - also not to be missed if it's still on! We also attended an evening concert in the downstairs smaller concert hall - a five-piece string chamber orchestra who played Mozart and Dvorak with passion, precision, and artistry, very enjoyable."

As we had not joined a tour of the building it also gave us an opportunity to see some of the interior of the building.An added & fortunate bonus for us tennis fans was the fact that the Davis cup was on exhibition for that day only with the Mucha works.While we we there we then decided to buy tickets for a Prague Royal Orchestra performance that evening in the Smetana Hall. One tip here.. we bought seats in Area B & were told that the seating was first come first served & that we could not book any specific seats. We were there early & choose seats at the front of this section only to be moved later by an usher who was persuaded by other clients that they were allocated specific seats (ours) in this section.This was very disappointing.

Prague's municipal house is a brilliant example of an Art Nouveau building, built in the early 1900's.While the building's exteriors are beautiful, it's what goes inside that is truly amazing \u2013 especially in the Smetana hall, where you simply HAVE to listen to a classical concert (mind you \u2013 make reservations several days in advance in case you want good seats)."

There couldn't be a better setting for the Lendl Mucha exhibition - which was excellent in its own right, but we also enjoyed admiring the Art Deco features of the Municipal House itself. If you're a fan of the style, be sure to visit all the hidden corners: the gift shop (ground floor), the American ba (downstairs), and the two caf\u00e9/restaurants at street level - all of which are wonderful examples. You don't have to eat/drink anything to enjoy them - though I can recommend the cakes in the caf\u00e9!"

The concert was advertised as 'Prague Orchestra' and we were told by two separate Municipal House workers that this was a very important and special event for Prague. Foolishly paid 25 pounds each a ticket (the cheapest on offer, double what we'd paid for the Philharmonic) to find 8 messily displayed stands on stage and only 100 guests, all of whom were tourists like ourselves. On top of the hugely inflated ticket price, we were then also forced to pay to have our coats hung in storage. A group of ten violinists and a keyboard player appeared and played songs on their practice instruments and it was very clear (I am a musician myself) that none of the members of this 'orchestra' had in fact played together before. After an hour of rushed and slightly botched performance, the musicians meekly exited the stage, only for the lead violinist to re-enter, take a second bow and then hush the audience to tell us that he would be selling his CDs at the back of the hall! An audible groan rose from the audience. All left looking as annoyed and unimpressed as us. Naturally, no member of staff could be found anywhere on exit. A complete and utter waste of money, time and a final night in Prague. An absolute and outrageous tourist scam like none I have seen before."

You can buy concert and theatre tickets in the lobby here. there is a great local cuisine restaurant downstairs at affordable prices. there is a 25 local table charge per person but it includes lots of bread and a schnapps to finish. It has live folk music in the evenings.The menu is good but if you order the duck or the pork knee we suggest you share between two as it is quite large. They do accept payment by credit cards.Waiters are not over talkative but do not hang around for tips etc.The restaurant by the lobby is nice but very expensive."

Foerster, with Chloe Hanslip playing the violine, supported by around 50 musicians or so. Excellent performance in the very impressive Smetana Hall. Where on earth can you find a better example of Art Deco at its best. Performance were pieces of Brahms, Beethoven and Janacek, including the concert break playing over two hours at a price of 460 CZK per person. It was money well spend. Different tickets can be purchased. Be careful of the cheaters in the same location of Municipal House (Oebcni Dum) selling tickets for various performances of the Prague Royal Orchestra, playing very famous music pieces. But we heard the orchestra consists only of 12 musicians or so, playing 65 minutes in a much smaller hall, with tickets around 800 CZK? Go check the information inside the Municipal House to find out more what is on, prices and so on."

It\u2019s located in Revolution Square next to the Powder Tower (which can also be viewed from inside, but we didn\u2019t venture in). As it\u2019s a concert hall you can also attend one of the many concerts that are staged there, but again despite being tempted we never went. To book a tour go inside and quite a way back (signposted). There are only a few tours per day, and the numbers are limited so it\u2019s better to book in advance. You pay a small extra charge for your photography pass, and it is worth it. The tour takes you into the concert hall, and then on to the many art deco/nouveau rooms and halls within. They each have their own character, and your guide will fill you in the relevant bits of history. All of the rooms are very attractive. Do make sure you take the chance to clap in the centre of the circular conference room. It\u2019s quite fun (you\u2019ll understand when you get there). You finish with a free beer in The American Bar \u2013 apparently Prague\u2019s oldest. I can recommend a meal in the restaurant next to the American Bar. It serves Czech food as opposed to the French in the street-level restaurant, and very good Czech food at that. It\u2019s a little more expensive than many restaurants (although by no means exorbitant), but you are sitting in an art deco hall and the food is definitely better than average. The duck is excellent, the quantities ample, the staff friendly, and you get a nice aquavit digestive to finish. It\u2019s a large hall, so getting a table shouldn\u2019t be a problem. They also serve a dark beer to go with the standard Pilsner Urquell just for a change."

But there is a difference between these nightly little mini-concerts performed for the constant flow of tourists, and the main events. I've heard wonderful things about concerts in The Municipal House, mainly because of the venue. So last April when my husband and I were in Prague, we booked tickets for a concert there. Buyer beware! The concert's venue was actually in a long, narrow room in the basement, and the musicians seemed that they'd performed the pieces a few too many times - it was a rather heartless performance.So, this past month when I returned to Prague, I was determined to attend another concert, only to make sure that it was in The Municipal House's main auditorium, Smetana Hall. The tickets were not cheap - about 75 Euros each. I was surprised that the seating area was just a flat floor with a lot of chairs. The musicians gave a good performance. However, there was an adjoining hall where one of Prague's other numerous tourist concerts was taking place. Not only could the music from the other hall be heard, it was quite distracting. It wasn't fair to our musicians, and it certainly was not a concert worth the amount we'd paid. And then after only an hour, the concert ended. Disappointing to say the least."

Well the program sounded good with Mozart, Smetana, and Dvorak highlighting the bill BUT the actual performances were second rate at best. I should have opted for a full concert somewhere else to experience Prague at it's musical core but August is not concert season time. At the night I went, the theater was about 5% full. I also not knowing I purchased a VIP ticket (1300 Kc) which gave me a private box for an \"orchestra\" of about 20 people which was way too small to really test out the hall's acoustics. To be honest, any seat in the place would have been fine for this. The program lasted for about 75 minutes with no encores and classics like Mozart's \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" were severely truncated. Also the concertos seemed like practice sessions for the key performers with noticeable mistakes. I would definitely hit this again during \"real\" concert season."

As tourist we were exempted of formal dressing but we were polite and with our best casual it was an experience for more. We went to the hall 30 min earlier to wonder of the oldest bar of prague located on the lowest floor..it's ok.as time for concert neared we registered and was impressed by the sculptors and decoration of the Hall. The lighting, ceiling and interior deco of old nominate it's right as Unesco World Heritage. Don't just wonder outside have an experience of the concert"

Though the entrance was quite expensive for us as students, it was worth every penny of it. The building is Art Nouveau pur sang. Marble, gold, glass in lead, fresco's and ornaments were all over the place that bathed in a warm, dimmed light. We were walking around and enjoying the music with a big smile on our faces that lasted till we fell asleep in our hotel hours later. We believe this was the best spent money while in Prague. Very romantic as well. Tip: Share a desert afterwards in the coffeehouse, which is build in the same style."

I was born and grew up in Prague and returned for visits several times over the years, yet the very first time I toured this beautiful building was at age 62! I was surprised to learn that there is no demand for tours in Czech, only foreign tourists seem to be interested in touring this building. However, the relatively high admission fee is probably the reason why Czechs do not visit. Tour fee is 290Kc/adult. There are few buildings in Prague that rival the Municipal House's history and influence. It was built on the site of what once was the Royal Court in Prague (seat of Bohemia's kings from 1383 to 1483). Completed in 1912, it was from its balcony that Czechoslovak independence was proclaimed on October 28, 1918. Its interior is lavishly decorated. The 90min (or so) tour was definitely worthwhile and I enjoyed it greatly. If you wish to take photos, you have to purchase a photo pass which costs an additional 55Kc. There are several fancy restaurants and the oldest American Bar in Central Europe. When you purchase an admission ticket for 290Kc, you get a coin worth 90Kc at the American Bar."

On one day we visited the Obecni Dum for coffee and cakes in the wonderfully decorated cafe, visited the American Bar in the basement, wondered at the fabulous Art Nouveau decoration, and came back for the traditional Czech food and music in the restaurant in the cellar. The whole building is one continuous hymn to beautiful design, magnificent craftsmanship, lavish care and national pride.The coffee in the cafe is good, the cakes typically Czech (beautiful to look at but only mildly satisfying), but the decor and atmosphere are fabulous.The walk down stairs is a treat to the eyes, where even the lift shaft is a stunning work of art and the tiled walls are a symphony in themselves. And, then, there's the American Bar - a masterpiece.But our purpose was not to admire the bar alone, but to eat in the basement restaurant with its rustic tables and chairs, fabulous decoration and vibrant atmosphere. The food reflected the old image of Czech cuisine, with lots of meat, gravy, bread and dumplings, picked fish and pickled cabbage washed down with fine Pils - what a treat! And, to add to the atmosphere, singing led (on the night we were there) by accordionist Josef Jehlik and double-bass player Alena Penzenstadlerova - they were a real treat. Doesn't sound like your idea of a good night? Give it a try, especially if you can take a party of friends with you and occupy one of the booths or tables for eight!"

However, consider seeing those sites during the day and attend an evening concert at the Municipal House. Arrive early, buy your tickets at the \"door\", visit the gift shop and have a drink or dinner in one of the beautiful dining areas. You will feel like you have been transported back to the early 1900's. This Art Nouveau building has been exceptionally maintained and will make you want to learn more about this amazing era in Prague."

The result is this beautiful and colourful municipal hall full of wonderful detail. As a Glaswegian I love Charles-Rennie Mackintosh, and this really helps my art nouveau cravings.The main cafe is spectacular and a great place to spend time with a coffee. Also, if you walk in the main entrance feel free to go downstairs to the small but perfectly formed American Bar. Great spot for a cocktail. To see the full glory of Obecni Dum, there is a guided tour of the main apartments. Did this a few years ago and it was very worthwhile, as there are some beautiful works by Alfons Mucha."

We paid 1100 CZ Crowns for a \"Gala Performance of the Best of Bizet's Carmen and Ravel's Bolero\" in the impressive Smetana Hall. We should have paid more attention to that \"Best of\" wording. The concert included \"ballet\" and 3 soloist singers (who were, to be fair, very good). The small orchestra was (as another reviewer has said) \"obviously very skilled, but they played like automatons, without expression.\". also you were left with the impression that they simply couldn't wait to get through this aria and onto the next as they had somewhere else to get to (probably true).On one occasion they started the next \"best bit\" whilst the audience was still applauding the efforts of the soloists so keen were they to get on - no wonder they brought it in \"to land\" exactly on 70 minutes as programmed! But the best bit was the \"ballet\" part - the three men were simply dreadful (fabulously out of time with each other and in one case rather overweight) - the children from a ballet school were quite sweet - but we had such fun (as did others in our row) at what was unintentionally so funny. inally, the Bolero, thankfully, was the full work and the dance which accompanied it was very accomplished - a very expressive leading ballerina. So go for a giggle and aview of the main hall but buy the cheapest seats!"

Wish we had paid for the tour rather than the very mediocre concert we attended the evening of May 12. The event was held in one of the downstairs spaces rather than Smetana hall, which was a disappointment, though the acoustics were good. The music itself was typical pop favorites, with a few nice surprises, which normally would have been fine. The seven players were obviously very skilled, but they played like automatons, without expression. Not one word was said to the audience, and there was no program, not even a xeroxed sheet, with which to follow along. A few of the pieces were needlessly abbreviated, and the tempos taken so fast that it was obvious they just wanted to get done as quickly as possible, We ended up paying 800 Kc for 60 minutes worth of music (and it was almost exactly 60 minutes--they were spot on about that), so we were glad that we'd chosen the cheaper seats. This has so far been the only disappointment of our trip to Prague."

You will spend most of the tour enjoying well decorated luxurious rooms. Mucha's paintings are the real star for me here still--they are incredible! The building is rented out as a venue for parties/performances/whatever, and several events were being organized during our visit, which caused some rooms to be difficult or impossible to view--that bummed us out a little.

If you do pay for a concert the tickets vary quite a bit and we found that the hall was far from full and people simply moved to the more expensive seats before the music began, which would be annoying if you paid top dollar for your seats. the reastaurants and bars are also very good and reasonably priced for such a place. You would be hard pushed to find the levels of cleanliness and attention to detail in London for example."

However, the extensive markerting and advertising around the city does not state that it is a small ensemble performing the concert and six musicians in the vast space was disappointing. While the music was beautiful I couldn't help feeling that the musicians had had a better offer and were rushing through the programme. Indeed at the end of the programme, long after the musicians had left the stage, most patrons continued to sit silently in their places as if waiting for either the second half or an encore. Very good however to see a very mixed group in attendance and enjoy the usual confusion as to when one shoud applaud.There is a restaurant and bar in the building which are highly and typically decorated in the Art Nouveau period but we did not visit these as they appeared over-priced."

It's just a pity that the company running the concerts charges upward of 700 korunas for a ticket to a one hour concert played by uninterested musicians. There were about 40 people in the audience so less than 5% (guess) of the seats were occupied. It would be much more desirable if they chose to charge 1 quarter of the ticket price to bring in more people.If you want to go anyway, I suggest arriving 20 minutes before the concert and bargaining at the box office. Be prepared to just walk away."

If anyone can argue that, then they must at least admit that is at the very least one of the top 3 Art Nouveau buildings in Europe.

When I tried to re-enter the building and climb the staircase back up to the Smetana Hall, I was rudely accosted by an elderly man who who said, \"It is not permitted! You cannot go upstairs. The concert over.\" I won't even mention the failure of the box office to offer the senior citizens' discount that is referred to in the program.

I think they are good musicians, but I expect them to put a bit more heart into the performance rather than going through it like it is part of their job. The soloist for Vivaldi's Four Seasons is the only exception. Also, the ticket is grossly overpriced for an 1-hour concert."

Don't be conned into paying extra for an official pass to take photos as you go round. There is opportunity to photograph what you want as the guide moves on ahead to each room leaving the group to follow. I thought the guide rushed the group on too quickly without time to soak up the beauty of each room. The tour was supposed to be 70mins but was more like 55-60mins by the time the guide had sorted out information sheets in various languages and the photo passes at the start of the tour. Don't be hurried on...if you want to take longer to look around do so. You will not be disappointed, especially in the room decorated by Mucha. The lighting, furnishings and hand painted wallpapers as well as the ceramic tiles in the basement will leave you inspired at the talent and skill from the period"

The tour takes about an hour and finishes in the American Bar where your tour ticket allows you a free drink. If you want to take photos then you must buy a photo permit when booking your tour. This policy is rigorously policed by the tour guide who stopped several people in our tour group from taking photos because they did not have a photo permit. To be fair, she did explain very clearly before the tour started what the rules were but I guess some people were hoping it wouldn\u2019t be enforced. Bad move.The architecture and interior design is simply wonderful especially for anyone interested in the Art Nouveau scene and is well worth a visit.The number of tours each day is limited to three on a weekend and two on a weekday so you would do best to check in advance when the tours are running to avoid disappointment.

We had a drink in the American bar in the basement, which I thoroughly recommend - it is a gem of art nouveau and the drinks are reasonably priced. It is terribly under-used - people seem to pop in, look and then leave. It would be lovely to see it full, as it would have been in its heyday."

Had a superb meal, staff did seem efficient but not over friendly, the cleanliness is brilliant, the atmosphere is grand, we did tip the waitress about 150 corunas.Next day went back for another meal and the service was fantastic, every body was polite and friendly, music from saxophonist & pianist. Yes 4 English guys who wanted to see Prague without the seedy side, I think the Czech people may be a little wary of the Brits, be polite & they do warm to you.The art nouveau decor is a true delight."
