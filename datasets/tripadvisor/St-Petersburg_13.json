I found no long lines at the ticket booth nor large tourist groups in the galleries allowing you to enjoy these great works of art at leisure.Housed in the beautiful Mikhailovsky Palace this Museum exhibits an impressive collection of Russian art from early medieval Icons to the great 19th and 20th century paintings of Surkov, Vanetsov, Vrubel, Roerich, Goncharova Kandinsky to name a few."

The interior paintings and carvings on the ceilings, walls and doors are simply superb. The craftsmen have extensively used gold to add lot of glitter to the carvings. Though in general the kings palace is very large, some of the rooms said to have been used by the family look to be compact. Anyway it's a reality and everyone visiting Russia must visit this place and enjoy the grandeur."

This is a huge museum which, for some reason attracts only limited tourist interest which means one can walk straight in and purchase a ticket without any delay and the museum is quiet and uncrowded. The display of the art is also excellent. Definitely a place we would return to if we revisited St. Petersburg."

Very large and diverse exhibit, focusing more on art and related items than on building architecture. Provides an excellent overview of the history of Russian art, imagination and creativity, from the earliest iconography through to the 20th century. Very nice display of Vrubel's work, if you already been introduced to him at the Tretyakov. I would choose this over the Hermitage anyday."

But we were so very glad we made the effort to see the Russian Museum. Though we couldn't make it through the many rooms and exhibitions, we saw enough to gain a much finer appreciation of the country, the people, their history, pain, and glory, all expressed through art by artists we'd never heard of. The thematic and Scriptural parallels with great Renaissance artists and sculpture meant that many works felt familiar and were as moving as pieces we'd seen at the Hermitage. We're not proud that we knew so little of Russian art and artists prior to this visit."

This museum offers an impressive collection of 19th century works, which are housed on the second floor of the Mikhailovsky Palace which was built in 1925. This is another building designed by the Italian architect Carlo Rossi, whose work is evident across the city. In 1890, Tsar Nicholas II decided to purchase the palace for the purpose of becoming Russia\u2019s first national gallery. It was opened to the public in 1898. The Russian Museum collection contains more than 400,000 exhibits. Over the past twenty years, the museum complex has grown to include the Stroganov Palace, St Michael's (Engineers) Castle and the Marble Palace. The complex also includes the Mikhailovsky Gardens, Engineering Gardens, Summer Garden (including the Summer Palace) and the House of Peter the Great.

Start with iconography and keep on going! Folk art, fine art, ceramics, lace all the way up to the present. Unfortunately the Soviet Realism is temporarily nomadic, but hopefully it'll come back soon.

Because my husband really needed to have a wheelchair, it was a tad challenging to get around, but the staff were helpful. I scooted up on my own to see the medieval Russian art -- not icons, as I\u2019d expected, but some beautiful paintings of religious subjects on wood panels. We also skipped the folk and the decorative and applied art collections. All of the paintings were by Russian artists, and they spanned the 18th through the 20th Centuries, giving us a sense of how they had influenced each other, what many of them had learned in Paris, and how individual artists like Repin had developed. (Like their Danish counterparts, 19th Century Russian artists liked to paint landscapes in Italy and other sunny places.) We found the Soviet Realism especially interesting and were disappointed that the museum didn\u2019t include propaganda posters and was rather thin on the Russian avant garde."

The highlight was the very broad range of output of Russian artists, the great majority of them unknown to normal Americans like myself. For virtually every esthetic movement in Western painting in the 19th and 20th century \u2013 19th-century everyday realism, pastoralism, impressionism, expressionism, cubism, and more \u2013 there were skilled Russian practitioners working in the same movement, and possibly others as well. Of course, the paintings also contain many references to Russian historical and cultural themes, a few of which I was able to appreciate, and the majority of which I didn\u2019t know enough to recognize.A few other comments on the museum visit. First, we only visited the main building \u2013 Mikhailovsky Palace. The building is impressive from the outside, but much more modest on the inside, at least when compared with the Winter Palace/Hermitage interiors we\u2019d visited the day before. It\u2019s less spectacular, but this also can be a good thing, because the artwork doesn\u2019t have to compete with the walls, floors, ceilings, and decorations as much. It was busy, but nowhere near as crowded as the Hermitage, or other most-popular sights in St. Petersburg, particularly with fewer tour groups. The museum is laid out in such a way that if you want to follow an easy route to tour virtually all of the rooms in chronological order, you can do so, although you don\u2019t have to do it this way. Finally, as a practical note, use the restrooms when you first come in \u2013 we saw bathrooms right near both the main entrance and the Benois Wing entrance \u2013 because we didn\u2019t see ones available elsewhere in the museum."

The major focus of the museum is on art of Russian artists from the 17th to the 20th centuries (mainly 18th and 19th century). There are some other exhibits as well, such as Russian folk art and Circus Arts exhibits. The museum consists of the main building and the Benoit building to which it is connected. You start out by going up the magnificent stairs to the second floor and then viewing the rooms in a counter clockwise direction. After that down to the first floor and rooms 18-35, and proceed to the Benoit building. Some featured artists are Shishkin, Repin, Serov, Kandinsky, Malevich and many others. I would give 5 stars for the collection, and 3 or even 2.5 for overall museum environment. Some reasons for the low rating of the environment. The labeling on many of the paintings is in really tiny print, and very difficult to read until you walk right up to it, even with my 20/20 vision. A significant number of the paintings are missing the year they were painted. Some translations and spelling into English are wrong or misspelled. When I first started viewing on the second floor all of the rooms were unbearably hot, even with me just wearing a tee-shirt. On top of being extremely annoying for the visitors, this cannot be good for the paintings, especially those that do not have glass protection of which there are many. Other rooms later on had open windows, which was great was the cool breeze, but again, I imagine this cannot be good for those paintings that are unprotected by glass. It also appears that the curators have not yet mastered the art of lighting displays and idea of non-reflective glass. It is virtually useless to take pictures of many of the paintings due to the really strong reflection of the the light. These were just some of my pet peeves, but do not let them stop you from visiting. Again, the collection deserves 5 stars on its own. Also, a guide might be a worthwhile idea, although I did the whole museum by myself in 3 hours and saw virtually everything."

Nowhere more true than at the Russian museum. I was taking pictures of my favorite wooden miniatures of a posse of mice parading a bound cat and was on the receiving end first of one of the fiercest scowls I've ever witnessed, then, once I'd noticed the eyes boring into the back of my head - a heated and clearly disapproving lecture in Russian, with arm waving. Saw others, Russians, also snapping pics with impunity so I'm still not sure what was going on. Anyway, this museum has some extraordinary holdings, including great grim and charming Russian folk art. Definitely go."

The first building I went in is probably The Stroganov Palace, built on the corner of Nevsky Prospekt . Since I didn't see some of the famous paintings I was expecting to see, I asked where they are. Then I was directed to The Mikhailovsky Palace, which is the main building. Yes, you need to buy a separate ticket here but it's so worth it. There are noticeably some of the same paintings you would see in Tretyakov Gallery and I don't understand why. I'm still digging into the information. BTW-there's very limited English translation anywhere in Russia. I usually purchase the museum guide book (catalogue) for me to read during and after my visit.

Unlike the Hermitage it ONLY features Russian artists and exhibited a wonderful display from early iconography through to 20 century/ modernist masters. It is not as \"well loved\" on the inside (some chipped/ mismatched paint) but the main interiors and salons are spacious and well lit. It also houses two beautiful and MASSIVE works from Ivan Aivazovsky. A Russian master who did stunning seascapes -- (actually he painted over 6000 pieces). It also holds a very impressive Last Day of Pompeii and Bruni's The Brazen Serpent (which is the largest canvas in their collection). There are also smaller table sized showcases (covered with velvet flaps) around the edges of the largest rooms. It's a little confusing but visitors are welcome to lift these little flaps and view beautiful little pen and ink, oil and watercolor drawings hidden beneath them (to prevent them from fading) The only thing I didn't like was the museum itself was a little disjointed/ maze like as it is comprised of 2 separate buildings. I also thought the rented audio guide was good-- but wished more artworks were covered by it."

The gallery of Icons was a wonderful way to start. Wonderful selection of paintings, and the sculptures - Vitali's Venus! exquisite.

Beginning with medieval church iconography and royal portraits one can observe the development of art and the wonderful expansion of artists' subjects and styles. I was thrilled to see two rooms filled with stunning works by Repin. I had limited time and had to leave after viewing some of the late 19th Century, early 20th Century art, so I didn't get to see any of the new additions such as the sculpture or folk art collections, or the Marble or Stroganov Palaces. This collection and the Hermitage will probably draw me back for an extended visit to the city.

We were particularly impressed by the very large collection of Russian paintings, the majority by artists previously unknown to us, and of excellent quality and interest. They range from enormous canvases many metres in dimension, to fascinating portraits and scenes. There is an extensive collection by Shishkin and Repkin, including the latter's fascinating \"Zaporozhye Cossacks Writing a Mocking Letter to the Turkish Sultan\". The sculptures on display are equally interesting. As with the Hermitage, as the collection is within a palace with large windows, the lighting in a number of instances is far from ideal because reflections obscure parts of the picture wherever you stand. On the plus side, photography (but no flash) is permitted, enabling you to keep a comprehensive memento of your visit."

We opted for the expensive - but well worth it - audio guides - which explains our speed. Each painting that is numbered is described in extensive detail, and then the biography of the artist is also provided. There are some standout images - particularly the paintings by Serov. His ability to give his subjects a specific identity (not always the one they would have chosen) was incredible. I was also very impressed by how 'uncrowded' the halls of the massive museum were. While you weren't alone - you definitely didn't have to fight for viewing space with hordes of tour groups and their guides. A wonderful museum, glorious art, some surprising new to me artists to discover - and a very reasonable price. Definitely a 5 star day."

The pieces are organized chronologically by movement, and there are descriptions on the wall of each room in the 20th century wing that help you to understand what characterize the currents of that group of painters in that era. It is rather pedagogical, helping you understand the development of Russian art in the 20th century from Art Nouveau, Blue Rose symbolists, early Abstractionists, the Knave of Diamonds group, Cubists, Futurists, clear into and through the Soviet era. A fascinating journey through one of the most interesting developments in contemporary art history. And it's a major plus that you can see the 20th century wing without having to buy a separate ticket (unlike the Hermitage, the Tretyakov, and the Pushkin Gallery, which require separate ticket for the modern art galleries)."

Back then I couldn't find where exactly was the entrance until I walked near by the small entrance on the right of the main gate. Nevertheless, inside the museum are collections of many national paintings including Jesus Christ at the Cross, Eastern Orthodoxy depictions, monuments of artists and sculptures of David, Venus, and other Italian style sculptures. Outside, sits the TALL STATUE OF PUSHKIN, the most renowned Russian Writer!"

Their paintings, local artists and their history. All this is here, and beautifully presented.This is my type of Art Gallery; real paintings- an exhibition of skill and talent, and showing real life in this part of the world. Thank heavens this Modern Art 'stuff' has not yet reached SPB - where handfuls of good paint are thrown at a wall, floor of ceiling!! Here are beautiful works of art. I visited the State Gallery in Moscow too, and again excellent Russian works by painters I have never heard of - but I loved their paintings.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia"

The State Museum is grossly under-rated and deserves more attention when you put together your St Petersburg itinerary.You will find that while the Hermitage focuses on artwork from outside Russia, the State Museum has some amazing pieces. Must see pieces include Aivozovsky's Ninth Wave and The Wave, Repin's Barge Haulers, Polenov, Makovsky, Myasoyedov, and my favourite the brilliant Shishkin.Some very bleak subjects but typical of the art of the times in Russia.Apart from the great art, the museum is normally far-less crowded than many other venues in St Petersburg. We had a nice stroll across a snowy park filled with snowmen on the way to the museum.Visited February 2013."

The building itself of the State Russian Museum is a beautiful Neoclassical former palace of one of the Romanov grand dukes. The exhibits in this museum are first rate and some of the opulent rooms are fascinating as well. The crowds are also less than in the more famous Hermitage.

The Ermitage never really impressed me (me being not an art lover), but somehow the Russian Museum hits a note with me. What's more, I find I look at the same pictures every time. The portrait of Shishkin, Suvorov in the alps, the Saporog Cossacks,... and yet I never tire of it.THe first time I visited, I had an SPB guide book with a lot of stuff on the Russian Museum, which was good, later I visited without a guidebook or anything - this time, though, I decided not to be cheap and went for the audioguide. More expensive than the entrance fee (but of course cheap in real-life terms) this was a good thing, highly recommended.On practical issue - the museum tends to get full quickly, and especially in winter the limiting factor are the wardrobes, so expect queues from midday on. OTOH; this means that if you come early, you'll be very comfortable. Life in Russia tends to get going around 11am (I stay with friends and they seem to believe to life in GMT time zone) - so try to be there early!!Time-wise we were there about 3h, this included a snack in the caf\u00e9, though (not really recommended). I could have stayed longer, but my 12yo was exhausted. The fact alone that he held up for so long speaks for the museum, though."

This was my second favorite museum in Russia - behind only the Hermitage. First of all, it's in a palace beautiful in its own right. Second, you're not as likely to be subject to the mass crowds at the Hermitage. (Although you will run into the occasional tour gruop or students led by a teacher)Most importantly, it is filled with beautiful art by artists you've likely never heard of. Some you may have, if you've studied Russian history (Repin and the like), but Schedrin, Ivazovski, Roerich - the list goes on and on. This isn't just boring icons -beautiful seascapes, modern art and excellent impressionism is intermixed with your standard portraits and well-done marble work.When you leave you're treated to a beautiful view of the Church on Spilled Blood (Spas na Kravi) to your right."

The Hermitage seems to be the top of everyone's list of art museums to see in St. Petersburg, but in my opinion, The Russian Museum was far more interesting and a good place to learn about Russian history and culture. All of the art work in this museum is by Russian artists. The collection spans Russian history from the early times to the present. Although most of the collection consists of paintings, there are small collections of other media including sculpture, wood carvings, and lacquer-decorated objects. The paintings by Russians are simply amazing. They depict important moments in history, famous characters, as well as ordinary life and people. Many of the paintings are enormous and cover and entire wall of the gallery. I found that touring this museum gave me a good introduction to a cross-section of Russian history as well as a taste of the complex soul of the Russian people. This will be the first place I re-visit if I go back to St. Petersburg."

It is very manageable and easy to navigate - a big contrast to the Hermitage which was a living nightmare. This museum has far fewer guests and can be done within a couple of hours. Highly recommend getting the audioguide as you won't be able to understand anything otherwise."

For those who love impressionists, don't miss \"Moonlit Night on the Dnieper\" by A.I. Kuinji. For more traditional excellence, Ilya Repin is most famous but we were also taken with Aivazovsky's maritime scenes, Rokotov's portraits and Rublev's icons. There are many more, so come and see something Russian while you are here."

As I've said in my previous review, when it comes to the Hermitage, it's certainly not a place to admire paintings, with far too many distractions. On the other hand, the State Russian Museum is just the place to go if you wish to concentrate solely on the beautiful paintings and sculptures. All of the important names are under a single roof, my favourite part of the galleries being the displays of works of Aivazovskiy, Andreyevich, Repin and some more Malevich, though his famous Black Square is in Moscow's New Tretiakov Gallery. It's manageable to walk through in one session.Only two nuissances: higher prices of entrance tickets to foreigners and some parts of the gallery being closed because of the renovation so instead of doing a round walk of the buildings you have to return and then go other way."

So if you are one of those people and you are not willing to spend your precious time trying to pronounce \"Ay-va-zov-sky\", then go to the Hermitage instead. On the other hand, if you want to see and learn something new and aviod crowds, go there. There were periods in Russian art, when we truly were like nobody else, and those periods are very well represented in this museum.Another great thing about this museum is that there is no BEST TIME TO VISIT or BEST WAY TO GET THERE, because it's never too crowded (just a couple Russian groups here and there) and it's located right next to the Church on Spillt Blood or Grand Hotel Europe and Nevsky prospect.MUST SEE: as I said before, there were periods in Russian art, when it was very different from every other art in the world. What you must see is the pieces created in those periods.The first one is represented by Russian icons, which in my opinion are perfect examples of something truly spiritual. All of them are located on the second floor.After that for quite a while Russian art was really influenced by Europe and we didn't create anything unique. All the pieces from that period is everything on the second floor, except for the icons, so I recommend to skip that.But then, starting the second half of the 19th century, something happened to our art and it became truly unique. Every artist had his own style and his own ideas. That's where the true Russian art comes and it starts on the 1st floor. Go around the whole 1st floor until you see the sign \"To the Benois wing\". Do not skip that wing and you will see some great Russian and Soviet art (19th-20th centuries).PLEASE NOTE:- The museum has wierd working hours. On Thursday is doesn't open till 1PM.- The museum is closed on Tuesday.- The museum is not really handicapt accessible, you have to go up the stairs in order to see anything.- They ask you to pay extra for taking photos, but nobody ever checks.- The cafe in the Benois wing is quite decent."

We visited the Yusupov Palace, Peterhof Upper Garden and Fountains Park, the Catherine Palace, took the hydrofoil boat, visited the Hermitage, rode the subway, took a canal ride and had lunch at a Russian restaurant on the second day and then to the Church on the BLood. It was very much a packed 2 days. We walked a lot. Lunch had been included in the price of the tour for both days. Catherine was a very knowledgable guide, explaining many details and the history of the city to us. She made it an extremely interesting tour. St. Petersburg is a dynamic and big city and very busy. Lots of tourists and of course, lots of traffic. Sergei did an excellent job driving us around. He spoke little English but Katherine would interpret for him. They both appreciated the humour of us Canadians and were even laughing with us by the end of the second day. It was worth the price and all the walking. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting St. Petersburg."

I concentrated on the paintings and there's far more here than I could take in during a 90-minute visit but I was so pleased to have gone. Lots of reminders of Russia's noble and grand past, spectacular landscapes, the violence of some of its history - and its very close links with Europe in the past few centuries and its shared artistic heritage as well as its own distinct traditions. Next time I'd come with a guide or at least hire an audio-guide, but for a first visit I was delighted just to soak up impressions and enjoy the sheer range of what's exhibited."

The museum encompasses art through the ages including handicrafts ranging from a wooden sculpture of mice carrying a cat tied up in ropes (the cat symbolizes the czar), ceramic toys (actually intact), traditional costumes and textiles to paintings that range from icons to the soviet period. It certainly is an impressive collection all housed in a former palace.Make the time and you will not be disappointed."

It is quite different from the Hermitage and traces purely Russian art from very early times up to the present day. It starts with icons and illustrates well how art developed in Russia from then onwards. It is interesting how Russians have copied other European artists over the years. There is also some interesting Russian folk art. We were pleased we saw this interesting museum even though we had already spent many hours in the Hermitage. We liked being able to see some specifically Russian art whilst in Russia and, unlike the Hermitage, a lot of the artists were new to us."

The Russian Museum houses one of the best collections of Russian art and craft in the World, from medieval icons to masterpieces by 20th century artists, and includes many landmarks in the history of Russian art, such as Bruillov's 'The Last Day of Pompeii', and Repin's 'The Barge Haulers'. The museum consists of two connected buildings, the Mikhailovsky Palace houses Russian art and sculpture up to 1900, while 20th century art is housed in the Benois Wing.The museum is laid out chronologically, starting with early religious icons in Room 1, and moving on through the centuries. The rooms of 20th century art are particularly interesting, featuring many artists\u2019 work you won\u2019t have seen outside of Russia. The Avant-garde was particularly active in Russia between 1910 and 1930, developing entirely new genres including Cubo-Futurism, Rayonism, Suprematism and Constructivism. The collection has works by every major Russian artist of the 1920\u2019s; Exter, Rodchenko, Filonov, Goncharova, Malevich, Tatlin and many more. From 1932 onwards the only acceptable style of art and literature was Socialist Realism, with its heroic idealised workers, and socialist themes, which are represented in paintings here.In addition to paintings the museum has collections of drawings, graphic design, sculpture, coins, folk art, glass, porcelain, and furniture from the past 300 years, together with contemporary art, installations, video and photography.The museum also has a charming 8 hectare garden, laid out to a 19th century design. The Russian Museum is definitely worth a visit, and is a much more manageable size then the State Hermitage Museum, which can be rather overwhelming. Opening times: 10am-5pm Monday. 10am-6pm Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. 1pm till 9pm on Thursday. Closed Tuesdays.The ticket office shuts 30 minutes before the museum closes.Admission: Adults 350 rubles. Students and children150 rubles. Public transport: Nearest Metro, Nevsky Prospekt and Gostiny Dvor.For further information check the museum website.www.rusmuseum.ru"

But that cannot take away from works by Rublev, Serov, Levitan and Kandinsky (to name a few). One of the two greatest collections of Russian art and a beautiful building on Square of the Arts. So unfortunately one has to ignore the discrimination against foreigners, which is offensive and lowers the image of the museum. It's almost sad in a way to tarnish the standing of a great museum for a few more rubles. If the Russian museum wants to earn more money, it should not bother with nonsense like overcharging foreigners, but should go \"commercial\" like the Louvre and Metropolitan. I must add though that most Russian museums continue to charge foreigners a higher rate. The Hermitage does it. The Pushkin Museum in Moscow does it and the Tretyakov too. It's wrong. I condemn it. But it does nothing to affect my deep love for these wonderful masters. Five stars is much too low a rating for the collection of the State Russian Museum.

Article 62(3) of the Russian Constitution provides, \"Foreign nationals and stateless persons shall enjoy in the Russian Federation the rights...of citizens of the Russian Federation, except for cases envisaged by federal law or international treaty...\" In other words, for a museum in Russia lawfully to adopt discriminatory pricing against foreigners, a federal law must explicitly authorise this. There is no such law. It is ironic that any museum in Russia, a country with highest number of millionaires and billionaires in the world, would continue to cling to such misconceived discrimination, let alone a museum in St. Petersburg, a city striving to promote itself as a world-class tourist destination.

Having just spent 3 days in the State Russian Museum I can only reiterate here what I have been telling everyone - it is without doubt the best lit, displayed and visitor-friendly museum in St Petersburg. Once you have located the Kassa (ticket office) entrance, a rather badly signposted doorway to the right of the main fa\u00e7ade, the visit is a total delight. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, eager to help and obviously proud of their wonderful museum. Arranged chronologically over two floors in adjoining buildings, the 400 000 works in the collection offer an incredible overview of Russian painting and sculpture from the middle ages to the fall of communism.The curator must have an astonishingly difficult job deciding which of the works in the collection to place on show, but what is on display is not crowded onto the walls - each work is sensitively placed and has sufficient \"breathing space\" - the special exhibition of works by Bruillov from private collections was beautifully hung - and the labeling is clear, at a convenient height, and in English as well as Russian.The guidebooks are well-written and informative, ranging from a pocket companion to a coffee-table tome. The entire premises look clean and well-cared for, and most of the rooms look out on pleasing vistas of park and courtyard.AND - there is a small caf\u00e9 in the basement run by very friendly staff with a good selection of beverages, cakes and lunch options, an enormous contrast to the horrors on offer at the Hermitage!A big plus is that tickets are valid for the entire day and multiple entries, so if you need a little while to recover from sensory overload, you can go for a short breather or a snack and go back later for a second dose of this wonderful museum!!Would not have missed this for the world!"

On Monday (our last day) we decided to split up and visit different attractions however when I got to he hermitage it was closed. I decided to head to the Russian museum and was very pleased I did. The art is more modern and contemporary steering away from the biblical depictions and naked cherubs. I think there really is something for everyone's tastes there and you could go about at a leisurely pace without the crowds. So many great Russian artists I had never heard of, thank goodness the hermitage was closed!"

Admission of 350 roubles is a bargain and allow a good 3 hours if you want to do it justice.

The Russian Museum has more art dedicated to Russian painters/sculptors than the nearby Hermitage museum and is a lot smaller so allows you to amble around without the pressure of the crowds. I'd highly recommend Lonely Planet's St Petersburg guide as it details all of the rooms and contents which helps as very little is labelled in detail on the walls. There are more examples of early Russian icon art than the Hermitage and given that the rooms are still very large, you can take your time and look at each piece without being disturbed. There is a natural flow to the rooms that lead you from one section to the next so no worries about being lost. The central grand staircase is a good place to orientate yourself. The cloakrooms however are truly baffling and we laughed when we couldn't find the right desk, going around in circles for 10 minutes down identical corridors. There is no cafe here so bring a drink and the last 2 hours of the day are an ideal time to visit. The schools have left and tourists are back on their coaches so you can have the place more or less to yourself on a weekday. It's also very hot inside even when the heating is off and summer hasn't warmed up yet. Dress light and with practical shoes as there isn't any seating we could find."

You could easily spend more.Our favourite section was in the Benois gallery, which had a great collection of modern 20th century art, housed in a beautifully light and airy space.I'd also highly recommend finding a map, to get the most out of this building. Upstairs is easy to navigate, however downstairs there are entire wings of the museum, either hidden round dark corners or down small staircases!"

While it is sometimes expedient to have a guide point out some of the highlights of a particular venue, I generally find it more satisfying to follow my interests and wander at my own pace. My problem with many of the museums/galleries we visited while in Russia was the lack of signage in English [or any other language, for that matter.] So I was happy to read that the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg provided a printed guide and wall signs in English. And what a wonderful collection of Russian art is displayed within the walls of the Mikhaylovsky Palace! The building alone is worth a visit with its grand staircases and statuary. The collection is well organized in chronological order with the earliest items dating back to the 12th century and ending with a large section devoted to folk art. This was the highlight of the museum for me \u2013 colourful toys of wood and porcelain, regional clothing, table ware, and of course, the originals of the lacquered spoons that so many people buy as souvenirs. It was a perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon -- learning more about the history and culture of Russia and surprise \u2013 when we left the museum, the sun was shining and we took another walk along the canals."

I also liked the idea with QR codes which shows you info on the work. Regretfully it only works with local soft which is aweful.Nevertheless management shows a lack of interest to its clients.

You need any way to spend there at least two hours just to walk around the museum. You will be tired, especially if you will pay attention to the art and spend there 3-4 hours. The park behind the museum is connected to the Summer Park - another attraction. It is rather good, especially after recent restorations.

Fabulous collection of Russian Art not seen in the west. About 10 pieces by Malevich and 3 pieces by Kandinsky. Plus a great collection of other Russian modernists. Collection ranges from 20th century back to the 15th century. Also a lot of early furniture. You must have cash to purchase in the museum bookstores. I visited this museum 4 times in a week. Postcards of artwork very inexpensive (50 cents per card). This mueum is next door to the Sacred Blood Russian Orthodox church."

After the Hermitage it is an altogether more ccessible museum and well worth visiting for some fabulous art and statues."

We sailed from Harwich and this was brilliant no luggage restrictions and dragging cases round. We went to Denmark, Finland, Sweden Tallin and Russia. We have never been on a cruise before and were not sure we would enjoy it. We are both in our early 50s and had always considered cruise for retired people, we were so wrong. The ship was a fantastic experience and the itinery was amazing waking up each day in a new place. We cannot fault the ship on cleaniness and excellent service. Also if you don't like dressing for dinner you don't have to there are casual dinning rooms that serve excellent food with lots of choice and you can eat any time the only draw back is the cost of drinks at the bar and 15% service charge. The sunsets are amazing and very romantic, we have some great photographs and wonderful memories. I would recommend a cruise for any age and you will not be dissapointed. Its like staying in a 5* hotel that takes you to so many different countries, you even forget your on a ship until you go on deck. You meet lots of people from all over the world and there is always a quiet place to sit and read your book if you have never tried a cruise I recommend you do."

The collection was wide-ranging -- including Russian Orthodox Church icons, portraits and furnishings of Russian monarchy, 18th and 19th century Russian art, porcelain and majolica, lace and other fabrics, lacquer boxes, even historical Russian housing architecture and more. Because I went in the afternoon and was tired when I entered, I only did the Michaelovsky Castle, which is huge. I did splurge on the English audiotape guide which was worth the extra $350.00 rubles since there was very little text --Russian or English -- accompanying the exhibits. Because I was tired, I told myself I'd only stay an hour or so, and didn't expect to get my money's worth for the $350.00 rubles admission. But the exhibits kept changing and were so varied and reflected things I'd actually seen in the country (e.g., lacquer boxes) that I just kept walking --for 3-4 hours. That's what a great museum should do -- grab your attention and hold on for dear life. The Russian Museum was GREAT!"

At $10 each, I think you can skip it if you only have a couple days in the city and are not particularly into Russian art.

Truly a must see if you want to close in to the Russian tradition and art. For using a camera you need to pay extra. Take your time and see this attraction, you won't regret it. And when you see Kazimir's Black Square you will laugh in yourself how much it is simple, but brilliant and original. Just don't laugh loudly, you will get some strange looks :)"

There are ever-changing temporary exhibits as well. A suggestion: use the entrance by the canal rather than the main entrance, if you wish to see the works of the 19th and 20th centuries.

This museum is my fav in Petersburg, more than the Hermitage. It is much smaller (but not small!). And its artworks highlight Russian artists exclusively, most unknown to the West. Had my notebook with me, and learned so much about these artists and their paintings. Serov, Filonov, Schedrin, Venetsianov, Repin, and others. I would rank this museum on par with the Orsay in Paris, for its sheer sublimity in displaying exclusively Russian art. Highly recommended, and yet, off the radar for most tourists."

I found the collection of Soviet Art especially interesting and challenging. But there is much more. Fellow travelers, make sure not to miss this fantastic Museum!"

Second, you're not as likely to be subject to the mass crowds at the Hermitage.

Some you may have, if you've studied Russian history (Repin and the like), but Schedrin, Ivazovski, Roerich - the list goes on and on. This isn't just boring icons -beautiful seascapes, modern art and excellent impressionism is intermixed with your standard portraits and well-done marble work.
