The food we made was the best we had during our trip! If you are looking for a fun, relaxed day trip with a bit of cooking thrown in- look no further.

We had a great day - being ably looked after and shown how to enjoy local cuisine with Ilham and Michel.We thought it was great value for money for 550D each - which basically includes everything for the day. Michel's sense of humour is ........ interesting (but he is French!) ( I can see him smirking at that comment! LOL) - but seriously - He and Ilham are the perfect hosts and couldn't have done more to make us feel at home and they really cared that we had a super day. Take a few Dirham with you as there is a little shop with good prices and interesting things. We really enjoyed this day and would say that it is a 'must do' for anyone who enjoys cooking or eating food."

I decided to book it since I thought it would be really fun and saw that it had great reviews. It was a full day experience from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. We were conveniently picked up at a location near our Riad. Along the way they picked up a few others. In total there were about 7 people in the class so it was a perfect size to get the attention and assistance from the two teachers. We switched from cooking our tangine to sitting, listening to Michel's talks and scent-testing various spices to watching demonstrations from Dhlam (the actual instructor for cooking) at the bar on how to make salads and this Moroccan crepe that was to die for.My boyfriend (who absolutely does not cook) took this class with me and successfully made his couscous and tangine. I was actually quite impressed.The instructors are very funny and approachable and made it a very fun and relaxed environment. It kind of felt like we were invited to a couple of friend's home to learn to cook.At the end of the day of cooking we sat together and enjoyed our meal along with the salads and desserts they made. Michel was great with sharing his stories of cooking and food. The actual instructor and demonstrator Dlham was lovely. I had this tea at my Riad that tasted so good so I asked her about it and she shared great tips with me on how to prepare green tea the Moroccan way when everyone was taking a break.I would highly recommend this experience to anyone who remotely enjoys cooking and learning in a relaxed fun environment."

            "review": "Great Cooking Class. We did a tajine with beef, carrots and almonds. Also we learned how to do the typical morrocan bread and three different types of marrocan salads. The place is quite a bit outside the city (45 Minutes drive). Someone from the Cooking school picked us up and drove us there. The place itself is nice and everyone had his/her one cooking spot. Michel (the french owner) did some kind of quiz with us so that we had the chance to learn about local herbs and spices. Also he shared with us his special tipps for buying herbs and to detect counterfeits.At the end we enjoyed our self-made meal and had the chance to asked Michel and the chef of the kitchen (sorry I don't know her name) questions about Marrocan food and culture. Afterwards Michel sent us the recipes via mail so that we are now looking forward to try our luck with Morrocan food in Germany."

From the beautiful little farm that their place is on to the authentic couscous that we cooked, everything was wonderful. We learned a bunch about spices throughout Morocco and how to tell the fakes on Saffron and Argon oil. This particular class was intensive as it took over 3 hours to cook the couscous meal but well worth it all! Soo delicious along with the homemade breads and salads we made as well. Cannot say enough about Michel's commentary...he is hilarious and makes the experience that much better! Book this course and you will not regret it at all."

The owners are really friendly and funny and it was such a good experience. I'd recommend this class to anyone. Along the way to the farm house you see quite a few things you wouldn't normally see. The farm house is in the lovely countryside. We made lamb taglines and bread and saw how they made salad and had some nice morrocan tea. The owners were very friendly and knowledgeable. My wife and I would love to come back if we ever cam back to Marrakech again."

I would suggest this to anyone visiting Marrakech as it was only a short drive from the square. We made some delicious food and learnt really great techniques. The day was extensive, including talking about spices, tutorials on how to make different salads, making bread and making a tagine. We also received a small bag of spices and Michel has emailed some recipes to us, both these things were complimentary. We also had photos taken during the day which were sent to us which was also very nice. Thank you for having us! Charlotte and Ryan"

We arrived, enjoyed mint tea and a chat, and started our cooking. We went on Friday, so it was seven-vegetable couscous. We started preparing the vegetables and the couscous. Each of us had our own station to work from. Then we watched as our wonderful instructor Iylha demonstrated how to make bread and two kinds of Morrocan salads. The couscous takes a lot of time to cook, so in between steps, Michel would teach us about different spices. It was great because we learned how to identify real saffron. We also made a delicious Moroccan crepe for desert. After we were finished cooking, we enjoyed our meal together. It was an absolutely lovely day! We got back to the city around 4:15 (which I'm including because we really wanted to know before we booked)."

It is started at 10 o clock and finished at 15 o clock. But there is no time to boring. The place is good, everything is clear, after one meal the employes come and clean everything, its perfect. They give water and fresh orange juice all the day, we don't know that and bring water, its totally unnecessary."

A fantastic cooking class, hosted by a great (and very patient) team.I enquired about this class by emailing Michel, and completed reservations for my wife, two young daughters, and myself, having gone through the weekly schedule received, and selecting one of the different main dishes on offer daily (the least technical, as my youngest daughter is 4).We were picked up from our accommodation at around 09:30, and arrived at their premises an hour or so later. The class, which included the preparation of Moroccan bread (batbout), a main dish (tajine of chicken with red olives), and a dessert (mesemen, later served with fresh fruit and ice cream), in addition to a demonstration for three different salads, and general information on local spices and herbs, was terrific and very enjoyable, and lasted approximately 5 hours.Michel, Ilham, and the rest of the staff, were all very welcoming, and extremely helpful, and were especially fantastic with our young children.Overall, a wonderful experience, which we would be more than happy to repeat the next time we visit Marrakech."

He replied promptly and told us a taxi would collect us from near our riad. The taxi had air con and it took us to the farm house where we were doing our class. It was beautifully done out and Michel was very welcoming. His staff were all very friendly and helpful and provided us with lots of drinks and snacks throughout the day. We learned to cook traditional bread and a beef with caramelised orange and pear tagine which was delicious! I would highly recommend this cooking class to anyone wanting a day trip in Marrakech as it's fun, relaxed and very informative. Only 1 tiny issue is that I didn't feel as though we did that much cooking for a whole day but it was nice to do a bit, have a chat about spices, listen to some stories etc - on the whole it was pretty much perfect! And you can book a spa trip for after the class for a discount (which we did and it was beautiful, definitely would recommend this as well!)"

We have taken cooking classes in other cities around the world, and this one, presented in a lovely facility outside of Marrakech, by the owners, Michel and Ilham, was exceptional. Everything is so well planned from the introductions over mint tea or coffee, to the detailed and clear demonstrations from Chef Ilham to Michel's very funny and informative \"blind\" spice sniffing test, and lastly, to the delicious meal we created, a chicken tagine with olives and preserved lemons, three traditional salads, bread, and crepes. It is all easy with door to door pick-up, and the facility is large, well-designed, and lovely. We were lucky, and we very much enjoyed the company of the others in our cooking group.

During the course we learnt in total six dishes (all of which you eat at the end) and had an introduction to spices which was delivered by Michel and a great learning point. The advice to eat breakfast should most certainly be followed as standing around all those glorious ingredients (we even cooked with real saffron) made you very hungry.

We learned to make three salads a desert and of course a tajine dish. Everyone was so kind and the establishment with the garden is lovely to taste your self made food."

Hosts are excellent - probably worth knowing there isn't a huge amount of actual cooking - lots of displays and courses but only maybe half or a third is actual cooking. However nice fun day and you don't go home hungry! We were out of town and got our hotel shuttle in which was very close to the pick up point - most hotels drop in the same place so not bad to walk to the post office."

If you like authentic Moroccan food and like cooking, the workshops you get here at Faim d'Epices is a real wonderful experience you won't forget during your holiday. We were picked up by the driver in an airconditioned car and after a 15 minute drive we arrived at Faim d'Epices.we were welcomed by Michel and his wife Ilham. She is the chef who gave us the comprehensive course.We started with a welcome with Morrocan tea and Michel explained the program of the day. After that we had a great spices lesson, with smelling of all these flavors. Together with a story about them, facts, history and nice to know things it was a very complete part of the day.After that the cooking course started. Everything was shown by Ilham. Making dough, baking bread, preparing the tajine with chicken, lemon and red olives, making 3 sorts of salades, you can either eat warm and other ones cold. Finally we were shown to made a great dessert and eat all the things Ilham and we had made. All recipes were given along with us, off course we bought some nice spices. There is a nice little shop were you can buy the real stuff instead of imitation on the streets.After that we were brought back to our hotel. The day was already over. Next time we come back for another course. Thanks for a great day Michel, Ilham and crew!!"

We were collected from our riad at 9.30 on Monday morning and drove to Michel's farm. At first we didn't know what to expect as we were there with a lovely gentleman from Peru who owned his own seafood restaurant and the sweetest family from LA whom had a french restaurant and a gourmet food supplies store in LA- we are total amateurs when it comes to food and cooking! Luckily, we were put right at ease and had no problems at all with cooking our lamb and prune tajine! We started the day with mint tea and a chat to get everyone relaxed, then moved onto the Spice smelling test which was fun and quite interesting! Learned some handy little tid-bits! We then had a demonstration of how to bake the local bread and after that we began cooking our tajine under the watchful eye of Illarm. After cooking the tajine, the bread, making our side salads and pancakes, we sat in the sun and enjoyed our feast!- best restaurant in town! On leaving we got our recipes of the dishes we made and a week later even got emailed more along with some great photos from the day! We decided to avail of the offer that Faim d'Epices ran in conjunction with a local spa, so at 4.30pm when we were done cooking and eating, we were whisked off to a lovely spa where we spent 3 hours in total relaxation- a traditional hammam, an hour long full body massage and then the chance to relax by the plunge pool and drink even more mint tea! We were only fit for bed once we left! A wonderful day, and one that we have been telling everyone about since returning to London. Thanks so much Michel & Illarm!"

It was really great to have the conversation with Michel and Ilarm at the beginning as it gave us a great understanding of the Moroccan context...great way to start a great day.Loved the conversation .They also have spices, utensils, and THEIR olive oil you can purchase to take home.

We came to this class after having done other Moroccan cooking classes (and been turned down from a few, as we were bringing our 4 year old, along with our 12 year old son). This one was our favorite - relaxed, warm and inviting, we also learned a tremendous amount - in blind spice sniffing 'tests', making our own tagines and Moroccan bread, helping with salads and dessert... Then enjoying the fruits of our labors in a garden looking out onto an orchard of fragrant trees! The staff even had set up a station for our youngest son, and helped him with attention and care to make his own kefta. This was a delicious experience my family still raves about -- and we can actually recreate the recipes we learned here at home for our friends!"

Amazing how many I got wrong, we're so used to cooking at home, we don't smell the spices just put them in whatever we are cooking.After that we were taught step by step to cook using a tagine, how to make Moroccan salad. How to make bread ( by hand ). We ended up cooking a whole meal, then sat on the patio and ate it.I have to say it was the best day of our holiday, thank you Michel. I would have no reservation in recommending this to anyone, even if they can't cook.

We had people from all over the world speaking different languages, and Michel made it all work out in a fun low key way. We learned about spices, made several complete meals, depending on your taste. I chose vegetarian including bread from scratch. Then came the the best part- sitting in the sun on the patio and enjoying eating lunch with all our new friends. Really fun and easy. My cooking station partner was from Spain and had a food blog, so radically more experience than I cooking. She seemed to find it lots of fun also- so it worked for cooks of all levels. Kitchen was very clean and modern and easy to work in."

A perfect day with some special unexpected treats. I will have this fond memory for a long time.A real highlight of my trip in Morocco. What more could you want?"

At Faim d'Epices, you get a full introduction into all of the spices that are commonly used, and most importantly, you get hands on instruction with the guidance of a native Moroccan. With the assistance of the chef, I was surprisingly able to create a meal that was palatable! At the conclusion, you're provided with a recipe of what you've cooked wrapped nicely in a neat little scroll. I truly enjoyed the entire experience, the grounds, the staff, and the sweetest little puppy \"Titi.\" I would recommend this class for all expertise levels."

As the title states, my girlfriend and I both agree that our day spent at cooking and learning at Faim d'Epices was a highlight of our time in Morocco. The shuttle pick-up and drop-off at our Riad made getting there effortless. We were greeted with delicious mint tea (avec or sans sucre). Following this we learned to bake delicious bread. Next was a blind smell test of spices and ingredients common in Moroccan cooking. Michal offered his extensive knowledge and gave us all tips and tricks for finding and purchasing the highest quality ingredients in the medinas of Morocco. Following this we made a tasty tagine of chicken with preserved lemons and red olives. We were shown how to make three delicious salads and how to make the famous and delicious msemen bread. All of this was great fun, but the best is saved for last when we ate the fantastic food we prepared out on the terrace of Michel's fantastic farm in the warm Marrakesh sun."

We followed the course with a lovely Hammam and massage which was perfect after our days 'work'.

Michel e-mails the recipes through afterwards which is a nice touch. I would describe the cooking style as \"rustic\" and will definitely be trying out some of the recipes at home, particularly the bread, salads and pancakes. I already have a jar of lemons pickling away in my cupboard. I enjoyed Michel's talk on herbs and spices and the blind \"smelling\" he did for us. Fun and informative. The woman who lead us through the recipes was a delight - charming, patient and instructive. On the day we went, everyone was in couples. Actually my husband had not wanted to join in, but ended up enjoying himself as much as I did.

Michel is an exceptionally gifted entertainer, and preparing the meal never seemed to be work, it was rather fun and affectionately guided experience. And by the way you will get prepared for your shopping tour around the souks: How can you find out if the argan oil offered in the bazar is of good quality? Is there a simple test which can prove if the expensive saffron is really pure saffron and not mixed with tinted hay? - Check out with Michel!"

The class is set on a lovely little farm on the outskirts of Marrakech- such a welcoming and wonderful setting. Michel was very charismatic and instilled a lot of fun into the 'learning' processes. We learnt all sorts of tricks (the BEST technique for finely chopping onions I've ever seen) and the final outcome was just so good. Loved baking the bread from scratch, something I will definitely make again. The tagine was delicious and well spiced (if I do say so myself!). The spices workshop was a great touch too and worked as a good icebreaker for the group. There is also a little shop that is actually cheaper than the souks so I'd recommend getting your spices, mini tagine dishes etc from there."

Our host Michel, picked us up at our hotel and dropped us off later in the day which was very convenient. Michel is a very dynamic person with a fun and very colorful personality. He first taught us all about spices which came in very handy when knowing how to spot fake Saffron or Argan Oil which are both highly marketed in the region. His wife was our chef instructor that taught us how to make fresh local bread, the famous Moroccan Tagine of Beef and for dessert, Moroccan Crepes with homemade Cactus Pear Jam and Ice Cream. By the end of the class, we were all enjoying the food, the wine and the new acquaintances. I would highly recommend this if you are someone who likes to do something beyond visiting the typical \"tourist traps.\" Once we returned home, I couldn't wait to try out the recipes from the class and use all the spices and new tagine pot I purchased.Thanks Michel for a great time!"

Michel gave us all a bag of spices and a recipe of our chosen menu and promised to forward more Morrocan recipes by email.All in all it was a great experience, well organised and informative, lots of fun. I would definitely recommend Faim d'Espices. Don't forget to buy their own olive oil wich is delicious and I forgot to mention Michel is pretty good on the tom tomsWill definitely go back xxx"

            "review": "Interesting experience. After dithering between choices, I plumped for this one because of the fab reviews. It was a birthday present for my two daughters and daughter in law.We particularly appreciated the pick up from the Riad and drop off. i chose what I thought was the vegetarian option of couscous with 7 vegetables as my eldest daughter is vegetarian but we discovered it contained meat! Nevertheless, hers was made the same as ours but without the meat - they are quite happy to accommodate. We also appreciate that they made a separate breadfor my daughter in law who is diabetic.The day consisted of a leisurely chat with a drink then down to work preparing our chosen dish. The whole thing was quite complicated and not something we would really do at home as it would just take too long. However, we learned some different techniques and background info. Instruction was friendly and easy to follow. The day was broken up with a blind spice 'smelling' session and demonstrations on how to make bread, salads and pancakes. Having a bit more input rather than just watching might have been nice as it's harder to remember how something was done by just watching.We were all inspired to make the bread when we got home and loved the onion relish that went with the dish. Sorry though michel, we all thought the final dish wasn't that amazing. I have to add though that I don't think that's necessarily the point of cooking courses as we all enjoyed ourselves, learned new things and had a fab time. We had also sampled rather too much of the pan fried bread and nuts that were put out so when we finally sat down to eat, we were already pretty stuffed. Could have done with a doggy bag!!Do go - it's a great experience and presented very well. I was a bit worried about the 'slaving over a hot stove' thing especially in the August heat, but it was very relaxed and enjoyable.Recommended."

Location is ok, but not close to the city. Michel, the owner treated our groep like we were children. He acted like a clown that needed to entertain us. Everything was already prepared and all you had to do during the course was copying the instructor. It was like: 'And now take the next cup and put everything that is in there in the pot. Now close the pot.' I was with my mom, we are both intelligent people and cook on daily basis at home. This was not interesting and the worst thing was: because you had to follow the instructions very strictly, at the end, it didn't even taste good. It took 3,5 hrs to make couscous and the instructor was very irritated all the time because we put more spices in to make it taste better. While the pot was cooking we had to watch the instructor making bread, watch the instructor making salads... BORING! Michel learned us about the Marroccan spices while we had to sit in a group wearing blinded sunglasses. Everyone was bored, I learned nothing, It tasted awful and it was a waste of time."

Michel is funny and really keeps you entertained throughout the day. The spice workshop taught me alot and made me realise I recognise more smells than I thought I did. The whole day is incredibly informative, relaxed and fun. I loved learning how to make the yummy msemen breads that I had been enjoying everyday for my breakfast at my hotel (I miss these now!). And how to make the tagine and salads. It was a good way to meet other likeminded people and I thoroughly recommend booking the deal with the Mythic Oriental spa to finish your day off relaxing at the spa. Amazing!

We got into Marrakech the night before, had a good sleep (it was a long and difficult journey), and woke up early to go to our cooking class. As such, we hadn't seen any of Marrakech at all. And it was perfect. Michel and Ilhame were so perfect, and made us feel like guests rather than students. We had a fantastic time learning how to cook a variety of Moroccan dishes, but also getting to know these lovely people. We feel that we now have friends in Marrakech, which is just great.We were picked up promptly at our hotel, and driven out to the farm for the class. We were welcomed at the door by Michel, who immediately offered us some mint tea and made us feel at home. We were lucky enough to be alone on this particular day - another group had cancelled - and so we had their full attention.I won't go into the particular details of what we did - other reviewers cover that pretty well. But I want to stress how nice and personable Michel, Ilhame and the rest were. We made a great meal (I can't quite believe I made something so delicious), and ate it out on the terrace with our hosts. We chatted about many things, food and otherwise, while enjoying the accommodation and the peace of the garden.Overall it was a fantastic experience. This place is number one. And all for a very reasonable price.PS - make sure to buy their olive oil from the shop. It is from their own farm, and it is heavenly."

My husband and I went on the cooking course for my late birthday present - I have been on three or four cooking classes in the past on our travels together but this was the first one my husband had been on, and we both had a great time. The course is held a little way out of Marrakesh, but free transfers are arranged from your riad as part of the course, and in fact it's rather a relief to escape for a few hours from the bustle of the city - we had deliberately chosen this course because we weren't interested in those interminable market tours which seem to be a given for most cooking courses. Michel and his wife were lovely, funny, and friendly, and we had great fun and much hilarity cooking some delicious dishes and learning lots of great cooking tips, before tucking into the fruits of our labours. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, great fun!"

All of the staff were incredibly kind and a lot of fun, and the food was fantastic! It was a great relaxing day out from the fast pace of Marrakech, couldn't have asked for anything more.

Although we chose to do the Friday option, we were advised that they could make vegetarian options on any day.Excellent value for money - you will have a wonderful meal in beautiful surroundings, you will have learned to make everything for yourself, and you will leave with all the recipes for the food that you made on the day.

Michel, the owner, is extremely personable and takes care of every detail. We were picked up at a central meeting spot very close to our riad and driven to a farm outside of the city and had not only a great cooking class, but a great meal and just a delightful day. The cooking stations were set up in a semi circle around Fatiha, our marvelous instructor. She was patient and explained the various techniques required in preparing a Moroccan meal. We were taught about the various spices used in Moroccan cooking, how to make bread, three different salads, and the chicken or fish tagine. It was one of the highlights of our trip."

We decided to do something useful on our short break to justify leaving our husbands at home and going off to Marrakech for a few days. This was perfect. Michel is bursting with energy and is always smiling and Fathia made the cooking and baking seem so easy. I'm rubbish at cooking in general but they were so helpful that my lamb tagine was the best meal I had on the whole hols. It's ever such good value for money as you learn lots of stuff, you get a good meal, recipes, transfers from town and we got a bag of ras el hanout to take home. And this morning I got an email with more recipes and a cute certificate with a photo. If I'm ever in Marrakech again I'll definetly do another one. "

The cooking school was well run, from the pick-up all the way through to dropping us off at the Hammam afterwards (we had booked the special offer which included a spa experience at Mythical Spa). Michel was a fantastic host, and really interesting to talk to, not only about Moroccan cuisine, but also about his life in Morocco. Fatiha was a great teacher, making us feel at ease from the very first thing she taught us (which was the Moroccan bread which looked really scary to make, but was actually quite easy with her guidance).Would highly recommend this cooking school to others visiting Marrakech."

My friend and I took this cooking class with a collaboration of a spa experience at Mythical Spa so it was a great combo deal. Michel was a very good host and entertainer while Fatiha taught us how to cook a traditional beef tagine and bread from start to end. Cooking wasn't too hard as long as you follow directions. I really enjoyed the spice lesson where we were blinded to figure out the scent of each spice. It was a little long but definitely worth learning and educating yourself if you don't have a large knowledge on spices. There were some lessons that is definitely handy and helpful for future references (ex: learned how to tell from real saffron vs fake)."

My friend and I recently spent three weeks travelling throughout Morocco and were very keen to try a cooking class as we both love the food. We found this course by Googling with no prior knowledge and were both very impressed - it was a highlight of our trip! Michel, the owner is friendly and funny and Fatiha, the chef is patient and kind. The company takes care of all transportation (20min bus ride out of central Marrakech) which makes it very convenient too. The recipes are for dishes we had enjoyed during our travels and the take home printed copies are easy to interpret to re-create back home. We additionally did the Hamman spa offer they had and it was a wonderfully relaxing finish to a great day."

We were impressed with the professionalism and staff (both in front and behind the scenes) that makes sure you can have a good time learning to cook without any of the mundane activities. The purpose built building is located on a quiet and scenic path of land about 30 minutes outside of Marrakesh. The spice class was very informative and interesting. The Madame who taught the class was kind, put us at ease, and gave us attention to feel special. Michel, is a comedian, easy-going and made us relax and enjoy ourselves more. The facility is modern and comfortable. I am not a cook but enjoyed the challenge and attention I received in learning how to make this dish. The food was delicious and abundant! Really overall a great value. Both of us felt almost anyone would enjoy an experience like this! Two thumbs up!"

We sat down and had a little introduction and a chat with mint tea before being introduced to the lovely Fatiha. Then we were given a little test on our spice knowledge and given some info on each one before the cooking started. We were given demonstrations on each dish before we the cooking commenced. There was music and drums and soft drinks and snacks and at the end we all sat outside to eat our tagines and bread and the lovely salads that were made by Fatiha and the team behind the scenes. The whole production is well thought out and fun, and I would definitely love to visit again! This is a must for every Marrakech visit! It's also great value for money.

Michel is quirky and perhaps an acquired taste to some. He does keep the atmosphere light and friendly, and (although he wouldnt admit it) was very helpful at times during the day when Fatiha was busy and we needed direction with the cooking. Fatiha is an excellent teacher: engaging, entertaining and helpful. The course offers a variety of teaching and learning mediums - smell test, watching, replicating, seeing and doing. I am a very tactile and kinesthetic person and prefer to have my hands on everything and be doing everything myself, but I can see why some parts are done just as demos. The way it is at present probably caters for a larger audience. I highly recommend emailing Michel and ensuring your spot with the Faim Despice team while you're in Marrakech."

This really help ease my worries from the day and continue with one of the most enjoyable days of my travels. Arriving at this amazing space of tranquility , colour and land we was greeted with smiles and laughter whilst sipping mint tea, coffee and getting to know each other. I was captivated and educated throughout the day with the information, history and skills of the Fathia who was our brilliant chief for the day with Michel providing entertainment in the form of jokes and bongo playing which adds to the authentic feeling of the day.The food provided throughout the day was full of flavour and plenty to go around , even giving us a goody bag to leave with including recipe of what we cooked.I also booked the deal with the spa after which was the most relaxing and beautiful end to the day with the Mythical Ortient Spa .

Michel was really accommodating with my arrangements for participation, which I appreciated. The spice workshop was conducted by Michel with excellent flair and Fatiha always had a twinkle in her eye as she walked us through the steps for cooking. After the \"hard work\" of cooking, we had a lovely relaxing lunch outdoors in the sun... One morning + afternoon might seem like a lot of time to spend on a single activity but a cooking course at Faim d'Epices is definitely worth it!!! This was one of my most enjoyable activities during my stay in Marrakech."

At first it seemed like a ways to go from the Medina, but transport (individual pick up) was super easy and it was well worth the fairly quick drive. Learning how to cook one of my favourite dishes (traditional chicken tagine with olives and preserved lemon) really made my day. But honestly, Michel and Fatiha were such wonderful people and characters, I'd pay just to hang out with them again. Don't hesitate, book this experience!"

Everything in the class was well-organized, and I enjoyed all the different elements: there was a blind spice test in which Michel taught us about how to recognize real and fake spices, and of course different cooking workshops with Fatiha, who is incredibly talented as a chef and also as a teacher. Both she and Michel were delightful--he's the class clown and facilitator, while she is the serious one (but also very warm and friendly). They made sure our meals turned out to be delicious, and it was lovely to sit outside and enjoy the fruits of our labor at the end of the day. Highly recommend this if you have the time to set aside a day in Marrakesh!"

It was a 09:30 start and finished at 16:30. We were collected by a friendly driver for our 20 min. transfer. We enjoyed the drive away from the medina, taking in the sights and sounds a long the way.Our knowledge of Moroccan cooking was limited so this was a total introduction to a new food sensation. We arrived to a lovely welcome with a drink and time to relax and meet the other people on the course. It was nice to have Michel ask us all about where we were from as an ice-breaker. Already we felt at home and looking forward to food journey.For me, receiving instruction from Fatiha was the highlight. She was concise, demonstrated the techniques with flare, a brilliant teacher. She had a great sense of humour so it made the cooking delightful and fun. I really didn't stop smiling and learnt so much. Michel added the light-hearted fun to the day with uplifting music and rhythmic drum playing. He was always on hand to check the progress with our cooking and adjust any mishaps.We made a tasty tagine of chicken with red olives with Moroccan bread (batbout). My partner and I love food and cooking. Being able to learn together in this lovely relaxed atmosphere was pure pleasure. We loved our day with these great people. A big Thanks to the people behind the scenes doing the preparation and cleaning up. It was seamless, merry, carefree and an amazing highlight on our visit."

This was one of the best days in Marrakech, we learned a lot (Tagine d'agneau with prunes, made bread, leared to do traditionnal salades) and at the same time had great fun (starting with rose blind glases during the spice testing ;-). Organisation was very easy, Michel picked us up at the hotel and brought us back in the evening. The cooking \"school\" is very well equiped, the explanations were very clear, so that even my daughter without cooking experience could produce a delicious Tagine ;-) and the group of people from 5 other countries was great. So a) I'd absolutely recommand it to everybody who likes \"doing things\" without having to be a great cook and b) a great thanks to Michel and his team for offering to us such a great day. By the way, we also took a cooking lesson at the \"Maison Arabe\", which is located in the Medina and which has a very modern equipment which turned out a good experience, but, gave us the feeling to be run as a somewhat more \"chain\" tourism attraction. If you have the choice, I'd personnally prefere the \"Faim d'\u00e9pice\"."

There was an enjoyable trip out to a farm outside of the city. Michel is an excellent host and kept us entertained on the journey. We did a blind testing of key Moroccan spices and other ingredients and Michel talked to us about each ingredient. Our chef for the day Fatiha was fun and encouraging. We learnt how to cook Moroccan bread and a lamb tagine made with prunes. We then cooked our own. We were also taught how to make a variety of Moroccan salads and Moroccan pancakes. At the end of the day we sat together to eat our self-prepared meals. We were also surprised with a lovely desert of a trio of ice-creams, fresh fruit and Moroccan pancakes. We also were served water and orange juice throughout the day. There is a small shop were you are able to buy dishes, tagine pots and ingredients such as saffron and orange flower water at reasonable prices. At the end of the session you are given recipes to take away with you. A week after I returned home I received an e-mail from Michel with further recipes and photos. At the end of the day you are either driven back to your hotel or there is also the option of the spa package at the Mythic Oriental Spa, which was very good too and good value for money. I would recommend this day out unreservedly and hope to be able to go back for another visit soon. Many thanks Michel and Fatiha!"

I think most of the other reviews speak to this, but I wanted to add that Michel and Fatiha were very charismatic and welcoming, which really created a great atmosphere. I'll definitely come back and learn another dish the next time I'm in Marrakech.One tip - do contact them in advance to see what's on the menu. There are different possibilities, and if you want to make something in particular, it's best to check their schedule."

We originally came to Marrakech to look at the souks but I am so glad I booked us something alternative to do for one of the days and so glad it turned out to be so good. Michel is an excellent host full of local information. The lady cooking was very friendly and easy to follow. The food we made, beef tagine with pears and the bread, all turned out really good and we have managed to replicate both at home since. A really good day out, highly recommended. In fact go before you go to the souks as Michel has some very useful information that could prove invaluable when buying spices."

You are collected in the morning then driven to the cookery school. After some mint tea your senses are tested with a spice test - then onto cooking. We cooked a beef, artichoke and pea Tagine with flatbread. All made from scratch - and with demonstrations from the chef. We made Moroccan pancakes for dessert. After the cooking we ate lunch outside - a real sense of achievement!! The host was very friendly and good fun - the day was a real joy- learning new skills and attempting a different style of food.There is an option to team this up with a booking for spa treatments - you will see this on the webpage. I recommend it - we finished our day being pampered and the whole experience was well worth it. "

It was a great day out- we were picked up from our Riad by the host Michel, the most friendly Parisian I know. At the cookery school we met the other eight participants, had mint tea or coffee and then watched a Tagine being made before learning about spices used in Morrocan cuisine. Then we made local bread and started our Tagines. We also learnt how to make Morrocan breakfast pancakes and salads. When all our Chicken and preserved lemon dishes were ready we all sat in the sun to enjoy the fruits of our labour. Delicious!!!A great day well spent. Thanks Michel."

Not only do you learn from Michael and Fateha the art of Moroccan cooking, but also about the spices themselves. My husband and I had so much fun cooking the best tangine we've had in Morocco ( and we were here for 10 days). You have an option to buy a package of Mythic Orient Spa (hammam) and cooking school for a full day experience; we opted to wait til Fes for our hammam to make use of more time exploring Marrakesh."

We paid about 45euros each for the day.We were collected by Michele at 0930am nearby our hotel and he drove us to the restaurant/kitchen in a beautiful location.The day consisted first of a nice menthe tea, followed by a demonstration on the bread we would be cooking later on. We then took part in a spices smell test which was thoroughly enjoyable. After this we moved on to preparing our bread which was ever so fun.We were then shown how to cook the bread, before making our main course which was a lamb & prune tajine (Vegetarian option available) which was gorgeous. A demo of three different salads followed as well as how to make the Moroccan crepes before we ate our food.Michel then gave us each a copy of our recipes before taking us back to the hotel around 4pm. Overall it was a really enjoyable day offering great value for money. Even if you aren't experienced in the kitchen, go along and give it ago, both cooks are ever so helpful and won't let you go wrong. Thank you so much to everyone involved!"

I loved learning how to cook tajine/local bread and my partner was accommodated with a vegetarian option even though beef was the menu of the day. The spa was great too- I'd always been afraid to try a local hammam and the spa version was the perfect combo of traditional hammam and modern privacy, anyways a great intro.

The experience was so good that when we decided in November to visit Marrakech for a few days of sun before Christmas we looked to see if we could do it again. We were greeted like old friends and had another fabulous time, collected from our hotel by Michel and taken to his farm. We learnt how to prepare a beef tagine this time (it was lamb previously) and we made fresh bread to go with our lunch. I rarely do any experience twice but we left wanting to do it again and I expect that we will. Later in the afternoon we were transported to a fabulous Hammam in the centre of the Medina which completed our day perfectly. Unusually the weather in Marrakech was variable but it did not matter, my winter break was made by Michel. I rarely complete reviews but when I find a reliable, enthusiastic and competent Frenchman who consistently delivers what he promises I will make comment.

The class was full of funny but also serious students from around the world and the instructors were excellent: thoughtful, but also demanding and helpful to students, like me, who were less skilled than some of the others. Rolling dough for various breads was a challenge, but we all prevailed. Highly recommended for its teaching skills, information about Moroccan spices, good company and a delicious lunch. It would make a wonderful family outing: kids would love the dough challenge and everyone would enjoy eating the results of the day's labor.

Nezha was very patient and Michel regaled us with stories and we listened to his musical talents whilst we cooked. He also gave us a very instructive lesson on the spices used in Moroccan cookery. What a lot of fun and we learnt something too - definitely worth booking. This is easy to do via email before you even fly there. Do it!"

Michel was very welcoming and great fun, and Nezha was a friendly and talented cook (and linguist...our group was made up of French and English speakers and she switched between the two languages easily!) The spice session was really informative and fun. We then made some delicious and authentic dishes, which we enjoyed eating on the patio in the sunshine. There was also a great range of tagines, traditional ceramics and spices to buy, which were much cheaper than we had managed to barter the sellers in the souk down to the previous day! All in all, a great day, with a great atmosphere and we would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech. Thanks Michel :)"

We crammed lots into the day. We learned about spices, how to make traditional Moroccan bread, crepes, three different salads, and a tagine. There was a good balance between watching the pros do it, and having hands on cooking. Also, Michel took pictures throughout the day and emailed them to me a few days later. And the day ended with a wonderful meal out on the terrace, complete with wine and good conversation. I have no complaints, it was a great experience all around!!

My advice would be to book this for the middle of your trip, as you can trade travel stories with the other students and get great tips from them as well as Michel on how to navigate Marrakech.

The level of cooking is not too difficult and it was great to learn about the traditional ingredients and cooking styles of Morocco. (We made lamb tagine) The teaching style was very easy going, and varied between demonstrations and hands on cooking. There was a very interesting session of learning about spices too. The school had a very warm, relaxed atmosphere and the class was a lot of fun. The classroom area is very clean, spacious and modern and well equipped with individual cooking stations. Snacks and soft drinks were provided during the day too.We finished the day by sitting down to dine on the food we had just cooked, in a beautiful sunny garden where much of the fresh produce for the class is grown.

We were welcomed by the owner Michel on arrival and offered tea/ coffee while we chatted and learned about what we were going to be doing for the day.

We could tell straight away that it was going to be a great experience, Michel is an amazing host, very funny and laid back and he put all of us (3 young couples from Ireland, England and Scotland) at ease straight away, which can be rare in Marrakech! The main chef, Nezha, is also lovely and a great teacher, she gave just the right amount of clear instruction and was very patient. Throughout the day we did a blind spice test (good fun and very informative), made Moroccan bread (was glad we got a demo first before taking a stab at it ourselves!) pancakes and a lamb and prune tagine. We were also shown how to make a range of Moroccan salads and crepes. We were happy to hear that the oil and a lot of the vegetables we used came from the gardens on site. We really enjoyed Michel\u2019s bongo playing while we were cooking, it added to the atmosphere! We also appreciated the water, nuts, and orange juice we were given to keep us going until dinner. When everything was ready we ate on the beautiful outdoor terrace. Afterwards we had the crepes with a variety of unusual ice creams and fruit, yummy! The food was out of this world and filled us up for the rest of the day, by far best food we had in Marrakech. We enjoyed every bite and it was really enjoyable to chat with Michel, his wife and other guests while eating. Michel was very friendly and happy to give us advice about Marrakech and was genuinely interested in hearing our stories. It is obvious he is a people person who is truly passionate about what he does and this really made the whole experience very personal, relaxing and pleasant. After dinner we were offered more tea/ coffee while filling out a short feedback form and were delighted that Michel gave us a copy of the recipes to take home:) There was absolutely no hard sell to purchase extras or shake down for tips which was really refreshing after a few days in the souks. We were actually sad to leave at the end of the day, would go back in a heartbeat! Thank you so much to Michel and Co., we will never forget the experience, I am already using some of the cooking tips we learned at home, the Moroccan way to chop an onion in particular! Don't even think twice about booking this course, it is worth every penny and then some, just book it and Michel and his team will look after the rest! Enjoy!"

I'd always tried to cook Moroccan food but failed miserably. We had a fantastic day learning to make local bread, a crash course on recognising spices by smell (not sight) and cooking a delicious beef tagine. We then ate 'en famille' and al fresco and enjoyed the fruits of our labours. Michel and all the staff were great and we've come away with a much better insight into the culture of Morocco, what to watch out for and a new found confidence in cooking tagines and accompanying dishes. This is an experience that no one should miss."

Then sat out on the shady veranda and ate it all, washed down with a glass of wine and some lovely home made ice creams - fantastic! Was picked up from the square in their minibus at 9.45 and got back at 5pm. Learned a lot about choosing and storing spices and enjoyed Michel's entertainment on the bongos as we cooked our bread! Bought a large pottery bowl (in the hopes I might find time one day to have a go at bread making at home), not thinking about the fact I'd have to carry it around and get it back to UK, but it made it home safely and is a lovely souvenir of Faim d'Epices. At the riad next day, we got chatting to a man from London and told him about our experience and he booked immediately and had a really great time too. If you are in Marrakech, don't hesitate to try out this cooking school, I thoroughly recommend it. Many thanks to you all for such an amazing day!"

My friend and i recently returned from a 10 day trip in Marrakech, as well as enjoying the sun and doing a few local excursions we attended a Faim d'Espices cooking class.It was recommended to me by a friend of a friend and we were not disappointed.Being a terrible cook myself i really thought this would be a bit of a wasted event on myself but my friend seemed hopefully and i thought I'd go along anyway.It was a great day from start to finish, everyone at the class got along. Michele and his staff were all fantastic and i actually learned a few things.We got collected in the morning from our hotel and took a short drive out to the cook school. We were greeted by a very friendly driver in a branded people carrier (very important when you are two girls alone in Morocco and getting into cars) once we arrived we were greeted by Michele who was entertaining from start to finish, we were offered refreshments on arrival. Shortly after we were taken over to watch and learn how to make all the traditional dishes on th emenu that day.In between this we were taught all about spices and picked up some tips on how to use them and how to look out for fakes.After we cooked our meals - which had intervals of laughter inbetween ( I was accidentally cooking my wooden spoon-i told you i was a terrible cook) we enjoyed all our dishes outside near the olive trees with a refreshing glass of wine.An absolutely perfect day, with tips and receipes to take home to continue the learning process - especialy for me.Highly recommended."

We have always been interested to know how to cook in the tagines and what spices we should use. Not expecting to learn too much from the course, we learnt quite a bit about Moroccan cooking techniques, the use of spices and the elements that make up each of the special dishes.We were picked up and dropped off at our hotel, the farm was neat, clean and our cooking benches were set up ready for us to play. After a fascinating display of making traditional tea and then enjoying a glass, we were sent on our way with great teaching and support to make our fabulous meals that we got to enjoy at the end of the experience - in a great setting.Will definitely recommend this to our friends heading over to Marrakech and well worth a visit again.

Here we were greeted with mint tea and a very welcoming Michel, who was very entertaining! The cooking demonstrations, cooking practice and other activities were all so much fun and the food was just incredible. The whole thing was so well organised and of a very high quality.

We booked it based on the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and I can honestly say that it deserves all those reviews! Michel, the host, was hilarious and so much fun throughout the day, while Nezha, our instructor, was helpful, patient and just lovely in general :)We were collected from outside the post office in Jma el Fna right on time and safely transported in a nice air-conditioned vehicle to the school, about 15-20 minutes outside Marrakech. We loved the school from the moment we stepped out of the car \u2013 it\u2019s located in the real countryside and the craziness of Marrakech seems a million miles away. Michel grows some of his own produce on the farm so it was nice to see the olive trees up close, as well as pomegranate tress and aubergine and tomato plants.Inside the school is equally impressive \u2013 the building was bright, cool and airy. We were offered tea and coffee upon our arrival and then were shown to our work stations. We were given a demonstration by Nezha on baking traditional Moroccan bread, before making it ourselves at our work stations. We were next treated to a lesson in spices by Michel. We were given dark glasses and had to depend on our noses to guess which spices Michel was showing us. He gave us some very interesting information about the spices too - the most interesting for me being how to tell the difference between real and fake saffron. After the spice lesson, we moved on to main course of chicken tajine with olives and candied lemon. The ingredients had been measured out for us so were able to concentrate better on Nezha's technique. We were given copies of all the recipes at the end too, so didn't have to worry about taking notes on the day. While our tajines cooked, we watched Nezha make three different salads - eggplant/aubergine, tomato and Moroccan. She also demonstrated how to make traditional Moroccan pancakes called msemen. Refreshments were provided throughout these demonstrations, so you weren't starving during the day. We had just the right appetite built up by the time it came to eating our food :) We ate on the outside terrace which was nicely shaded. It was wonderful - the company was good and the farm is in such a peaceful location! And the most important thing - the food was outstanding! I couldn't believe I had cooked something so delicious - it was very satisfying :) The pancakes came served with fruit and probably the best ice cream I've ever had - it was homemade on site and came in a variety of wonderful and exotic Before leaving, we looked around the lovely gift shop that is on site. I'd recommend buying saffron here because Michel gets it from a very good (and unusual) supplier. Plus you are guaranteed the real deal. My mother also bought a tajine (which we got home in one piece in our hand luggage!). Michel also gave everybody a sachet of spices to bring away, along with copies of the recipes in cute glass tubes! To summarise, it was an amazing day out for so many reasons! I'd recommend it as a must-do activity in Marrakech. Wonderful wonderful experience. Thanks again to Michel, Nezha and the rest of the staff :) I hope the recipes turn out as good now that we're home :)"

An especially entertaining part of the day was when Michael tried to get a bread kneading rhythm going in the room by bringing out the bongos!

The farm provided smiley transport to and from our riad which was comfortable, safe and punctual. Michel himself is larger than life with a huge smile and we really enjoyed his company and learned about so much more than just Moroccan cuisine. The day was very well organised but still had a very relaxed feel. The facilities on the farm are top notch and the cooking lessons made us feel like we were Michelin star chefs! Very thankful for such a fun day, and such unbelievable value for money. You won't regret it. Not to be missed."

However I was not expecting that we would only eat anything at 3pm - by this time we were absolutely starving. I didn't really enjoy the last hour because of this-so would recommend a large breakfast or to take snacks. Other than that, very relaxed and fun experience"

Really enjoyed Michels sense of humor; his hand drumming was a nice accompaniment for when we got down to work. We got a very good introduction to Moroccan herbs and spices, and learned to make flat bread, salads, Moroccan-style 'crepes' and a beautiful chicken tagine with lemon and olives.

We made khobz (Moroccan white bread), chicken tagine with preserved lemons and olives and crepes. The menu changes daily so you can pick what suits you best. Everything was delicious! They also supply the recipes; however, I would recommend taking notes on technique. Your mise en place is already done, although you do learn to cut an onion in the Moroccan fashion without a cutting board. I look forward to trying the recipes at home. Make sure you have a good breakfast as lunch is served a tad late. I found it very easy to make a reservation and the pick-up was on-time.

The spice test was very tricky (with a few red herrings thrown in for good measure). I have learned that I need to do some swatting up on my spice identification!With the expert guidance of our multilingual chef, we managed to cobble together some very tasty Moroccan food which we will definitely be replicating back at home (we have already bought all of the spices that we need).The day ended drinking Moroccan wine and enjoying the fruits of our labour outside on the veranda looking out onto the olive farm and orchard.As I said in the title, I would highly recommend this to anyone who has even a slight interest in food."

The place where to class took place felt quite rural and a little outside of the city limits. Michel was a very friendly and personable host with great people skills. Amazing!!!! Besides that extremely knowledgable. He gave us a crash course in spices and herbs. We then proceeded with the actual cooking; traditional bread and chicken with preserved lemon tajine.

There are different menus on different days and today we learned how to make bread, crepes, 7 vegetable cous cous and two types of moroccan salads, and also learned a lot about different spices and cooking. Make sure you eat a decent breakfast because we didn't eat until about 3.15, with a few nibbles (nuts, raisins and fresh bread with olive oil) while we waited for our cous cous to cook. Finally we sat outside and ate and it was all so delicious! Such a great experience and introduction to moroccan food- would highly recommend!!"

We finished by eating our lovely meal in the garden.We thought the activity was good value. As well as learning a lot about Moroccan cooking and spices we had a great meal in a lovely environment and with good company. It was particularly refreshing not to be pressured to buy extras. In fact it was quite the opposite. After we returned home, Michael sent us photos of the day and some extra recipes. A lot of companies running activities of this kind would take the opportunity to charge extra for these.We are looking forward to trying out some of the recipes at home."

My partner and I visited Faim D'Epice on May 1st 2014.We were met right on time by Michel at Jamaa el Fna Post office and after waiting for other people for nearly half an hour (who never arrived) we were driven to the farm. This was our first day in Marrakech so it was nice to see a bit of the less touristy city/countryside along the way.After a short drive (and a local geography lesson) we arrived and were quickly greeted with Tea, Coffee and Mint Tea and had a quick look around until the other people in our class arrived. The cooking class and the spice testing was all very lighthearted and interesting... My one and only criticism which has NOTHING TO DO WITH FAIM D'EPICE is that 1 or 2 times it was a little boring for us, simply because we (being ignorant Kiwis) only speak English and at times we would have to wait whilst Michel spoke to us in English and then to the rest of the group in French. My partner and I had a great time, we learnt a few traditional morrocan techniques and thanks to Michel and Nezha had an enjoyable afternoon cooking and meeting new people. Our food was delicious and we will certainly be recycling the things we learnt in our own kitchen.I would happily recommend this lesson to anyone (if not for the knowledge gained then simply for a nice relaxing day of food and bad French banter ) Michel may not be able to cook but he certainly made us feel welcome and set the tone for what was a great time in Marrakech."

Michel welcomes you with his lovely spirit we felt at ease at once. He kept checking everybody's here by name which was nice and subtle way to get to know each others. The cook was absolutely brilliant and exceptionally skilled although she did not study that, but these are the kind of skills that a life long experience comes more valuable than a degree. I have not tasted as good a tagine as the one we cooked under her instructions. There was a spice workshop as well that was fun and informative. Although the space felt very safe, you should know that there is no lockers / a specific place for your bags etc. For the price it was a money well spent. I definitely highly recommend."

This is about as relaxing a day as you're likely to have, along with my wife and 10 year old son we were picked up outside the post office and whisked of into the country side. Michel is an entertainer, he put everyone at ease and as the day progressed we found the general noise level in the room rose as each group relaxed and everyone started to talk together (around 16 people in total). My son easily accomplished the same level of cooking as all the adults in the room (surpassed me) thanks to the attention Nezha and Michel gave him. When the testing of spices, the baking and the cooking was over, we sat out in the beautiful garden and enjoyed the fruits of our labours! Now to attempt it again at home....Many thanks guys for a wonderful day!"

Your return is also catered for as part of the cost.This is a professionally run school, the work stations are well set out and the progress of the day runs smoothly. You will learn a lot about the traditional elements of Morrocan cuisine and in this hands on environment you will gain the skills to recreate the menu at home!

From here we had a lovely enriching day learning how to make couscous and a variety of Moroccan staples. The facilities were spotless, the farm picturesque, the staff were wonderful and spoke excellent English and French. Michel was the perfect host, and I was sorely tempted to book the entire week of classes. Each day has a different menu, and I highly recommend this is worth making time for in your trip.

And of course lunch, when the tagine is cooked (apart from what you cook yourself the team is preparing some salads and dessert).But don't overlook the relaxed atmosphere created by Michel, he is a funny guy and knows how to entertain his guests, he always has a story to tell and when you're in the middle of preparing your dish he even tries to set the rhythm by beating the drums :).I was impressed by the taste and aroma of my tagine (it was the best meal I had in Morocco) and since Michel gave us the recipes I will try to cook one at home (I will ask him for tips if I fail).

Collection and drop off was on time and as agreed. Facilities, food and drink at the cookery school were excellent.My fiance and I had such a great day and really didn't want to leave at the end. The whole experience was excellent, food we prepared superb (under the watchful eye of our tutor) and atmosphere really great - it felt like we were learning a great deal but it was very relaxing and enjoyable. We loved the meal together at the end outside in the warmth of Marrakech (but in the shade thank goodness) and would definitely do this again. The icecream was amazing too...We came away with some spices and a recipe for the Beef and peas we made on the day and have since had some pictures and additional recipes sent through by email from Michel. Everyone was in a couple on our visit and both men and women alike really seemed to enjoy the day.It seems quite expensive when comparing it to Marrakech prices for food etc but it was something we would definitely do again and was in line with other trips offered - we also didn't need dinner that evening either. All in all, well worth the money and highly recommended by us both. Thank you"

We paid for the course on the actual day, which for me, I liked the fact that I didn't have to transfer money before hand or give out card details, it cost 55 euros each, or you can pay in dirhams. the actual day was great, Michel picked us up from our hotel in his mini bus, and dropped us off later at the end of the course. the day was a great mix of hands on cooking,observing Neezha cook and eating! at the end of the day we sat outside in the sunshine and ate all the delicious food with a glass of wine.

Neezha (the chef) was clear, helpful and friendly throughout the entire cooking experience. We made a typical Moroccan bread, a tagine and pancakes and she also taught an additional 3 moroccan salads to complement your meal. The food (though I may be biased at this point) was absolutely delicious, we sat outside on a beautiful sunny day with Michel and the whole group from the course, enjoying our meal with homemade ice creams and fruit with a glass of Moroccan wine. We were lucky to have a really fun group of people and Michel and Neezha were so relaxed and entertaining the whole experience was a huge success. At the end of the course we were given the recipes for the dishes we had made (beautifully presented) and the workshops own special blend of Ras El Hanout (a blend of 63 spices) which were both lovely touches. When I come back to Marrakech I will definitely be booking another course here.It's worth mentioning that this course was very easy to book - I emailed Michel about 5 days before enquiring and he replied promptly explaining everything. I was able to request a vegan alternative to the beef tagine with no fuss whatsoever and what I made was as delicious and interesting as the other dishes. We chose the full day experience with the spa afterwards where we were dropped off, again by the driver, which was also delightful! I'd investigated other courses but most of them looked to be more rigid/not as well rounded as this one.5* all the way!"

We were picked up promptly close to our riad; after picking up the other guests we had time to get to introduce ourselves and enjoy some of Morocco's beautiful countryside on the journey to the cookery school. We made the couscous with beef and seven vegetables; the caramelised onions that top this dish are totally delicious!!! Michel explained that they were cooking genuine Moroccan food with less oil and using a blend of spices that gave a full flavour to the food. Nezha was excellent at demonstrating the recipes and showed us how to make bread, pancakes and Moroccan salads while our meal was cooking. Nezha's natural skill at cooking and cheerful, friendly way of encouraging everyone to use the correct techniques (eg. no stirring the meat and veg while they cook, you must shake the pan so that the vegetables stay whole) created a warm relaxed atmosphere. Chopping onions Moroccan style was great fun, as was preparing the tomato - I've never used either technique before but will certainly use them now to give super speedy results at a high standard to my cooking at home. Michel took us through a couple of short, fun sessions identifying spices and kept us well provided with snacks, fresh orange juice and water while we worked. Our session ended with us all enjoying our meal on the sunny terrace chatting with Michel and the other guests. We finished with mint tea/coffee and left with a beautifully presented copy of the recipe that we had made and a free package of Michel's special blend of spices. Wonderful food, lots of fun, great company - one of the best days of our all to brief holiday in Marrakech."

The cookery tutor that my husband calls \"mini-Nigella\" was absolutely lovely and gave a great deal of detail during the demonstration and then watched over the 12 of us while we put into practice what we had learned. It was all very informal but so efficiently executed by the staff. Our work stations were replenished with cookery utensils and food/spices while we were watching demonstrations and Michel kept checking our tagines while we were shown how to make crepes. We were really impressed by the organisation of the day. We were picked up in central Marrakesh and taken by minibus to the school which was about 20 minutes outside town. In total there were 12 on our course, mainly Scandinavians plus an American couple and us (Brits).To be honest, because I felt the course was inexpensive, I had no great expectations for the day. I was truly mistaken. We were given refreshments throughout the course and received some really useful information about a large range of spices and oils - all in addition to the cooking experience. I would recommend the day to anybody who has an interest in food. If you have any allergies, then Michel will cater around these.

Michel, the owner, is an engaging host, slightly offbeat(!), but he made the day really fun and the actual instructor was just lovely and clearly very skilled. There was a really friendly, relaxed and warm atmosphere. I'm a keen cook and the day showed me how easy it is to cook flavoursome authentic Morrocan food. We can't wait to try the recipes out at home; in fact we're going to buy a tagine! The tagine of lamb with prunes and bread that we cooked on the day as well as the salads that we watched being prepared were absolutely delicious and it was lovely sitting outside eating the food and chatting with the rest of the group with a cheeky glass of wine afterwards. We took the recipes of what we cooked home with us and Michel has since sent an email with more recipes and photos from the day. Little things made the day something special, like the fresh orange juice and nuts that we were provided to keep us going, the unexpected dessert after our lunch and being given a little packet of spices to take home. And Michel suddenly playing a bongo while we were cooking our bread!A wonderful way to spend the day (and it is a whole day), especially if you get a day when the weather's not so nice like we did. Well organised, a nice setting and good value for what you get. A great insight into Morrocan food culture. Recommended without hesitation!"

The finale of our meal outside on the verandah made a feast for the senses and was truely an international event with British, Dutch, French, Moroccan and Italian input. Strangers at the beginning of the day were friends by the end. Well thought out cookery day with an attention to detail that makes this a Moroccan must do!"

            "review": "Brilliant full day cookery class. A friend and I had a great day out at Faim d'Epices .From the start e-mail communication was excellent, we were collected on time at the agreed point in Marrakech and taken some way outside the city to the very well equipped kitchens where we had our lessons and demonstrations.I hope Michel, the French owner and boss, wont mind me saying that he is slightly crazy, in a nice way of course and he is very knowledgeable and made the day great fun. He speaks excellent English and kept the banter up throughout the day which kept us amused.The real star is Nezza our superb instructor for the day ( and if I can embarrass her,she is absolutely gorgeous,oh to be 30 years younger !) who dazzled us with her gastronomic skills.In the West we use so many machines, recipes, tools, instructions etc, Nezza does it all by eye, no weighing or measuring, no reading instructions and with the minimum of tools and mainly with her hands. Watching her knead bread or making Moroccan crepes is to watch an artist at the height of her powers...apologies if this sounds a bit overdone but she is so skilful it puts us amateur cooks to shame.We made a tagine of beef with seven vegetables with couscous and we were given very precise instructions so there was no risk that anything would go wrong.To be honest there was rather too much faffing around with couscous than I would have liked, developing some other skills e.g with bread making would have been a better us of our time I think, but this is a trivial point really when we had such fun making our lunch.Michel tried to keep us guessing with the spices, oils and herbs we had to smell to identify ( blacked out sunglasses were provided to avoid peeping ) again great fun and a useful knowledge base for using Moroccan produce at home. For anyone reading this who has not tried Argan oil, please do so,it may be expensive but is delicious.Eating our lunch was a real pleasure and a dessert was whipped up by the staff to complement the tajine before we were taken back to Marrakech with recipes to try at home.All in all a great day and thoroughly recommended"

            "review": "Wonderful day. We have been in Marrakech in January and maybe the \"off-season\" was our luck because there were two free spots in a cooking class suitable for our time schedule. I have to mention that I emailed Michel the evening before the class (very spontaneously) and he got back to me not even 15 minutes later. He was very well organised and friendly. The pick up at the big square was on time and the weather was perfect for a day outside of marrakech. It may be a cooking class with a less difficulty level, but that does not make it bad or boring. I read the bad reviewa and all I can say is: depends on you what to make of it. I found Michel quite amusing and he cracked me up. Nezha was a very good teacher. When I came home from Morocco I made the whole thing for my family and they absolutely loved it. People, I don't think it's right to go on bad about another's existence just because tastes and styles are different. That's what humans are made of. If I were to visit Marrakech again I would definitely visit the farm again for another wonderful day."

My two daughters and I were keen to learn to cook real Moroccan food and after reading many reviews and being put off by courses that gushed on about touring the markets \"where we choose our chicken which is quickly dispatched in boiling water\"!!! I called up and was assured by Michel that I wouldn't have to look in the eye of what we were going to be cooking, nor wasting time at the market, I signed us up.We were picked up the next morning and taken into the countryside where Michel \u2013 a delightfully eccentric Frenchman - has a lovely facility surrounded by orange trees. He served us glasses of Moroccan mint tea and introduced us to Nehza who would be taking us through the steps of preparing a tagine of beef with pears and candied oranges - yummy! But first we had to \"awaken our senses\" and guess the spices Michel held under our noses while we wore blacked out glasses. He then explained a little of each of the spices and how they are used, how to tell real saffron threads from the fakes and real Argon oil from one bulked up with added vegetable oils.We then had a demonstration of how to make Moroccan bread by Nehza and then made our own. We then moved into the kitchen and prepared our tagines following along with Nehza\u2019s demonstration and assistance while Michel serenaded us on his African drums. While our individual tagines cooked, we learned how to make 3 different Moroccan salads and their yummy square pancakes.Soon our tagines were ready and we were all delighted with the results. When we lifted off the lids of our tagines, the fragrances were divine! We then got to eat them, our bread, salads and pancakes with surprise icecreams in the sunny courtyard. The day flew by and soon it was 5pm and time to head back into town to the hammam we\u2019d booked as part of the deal with Faim d\u2019Epices, at Mythic Spa. Where we were treated to a steam bath, grommage (body scrub) and 1 hour massage. We arrived back at our Riad exhausted and very clean at 10pm!The tagine we cooked that day was the best food we ate in Marrakech and I can\u2019t wait to get home and make one myself."

Nezha, our tutor for the day warmed to our sense of fun and we all laughed and joked our way through what was a fantastic learning experience.Nezha coaxed and cajoled and encouraged to make sure everyone was progressing well and, in the end, even the kids turned out perfect dishes they could be proud of.Hugely enjoyable, great fun and, combined with the spa experience at Mystic Oriental Spa it's incredible value for money.Thanks Michel and Nezha for a fabulous day!

After reviewing a lot of resources about cooking classes in Marrakesh, and reading Trip Advisor reviews, my friend and I decided that this looked like the best deal to provide us a sophisticated cooking experience. Over the years, I've taken many cooking classes -- at home and on vacations. Without a doubt, this is my favorite class so far! The class is suitable for beginner level cooks or those with a lot of experience. (Usually, its hard to find a class that spans a broad spectrum of experiences but our couscous class did.)Our instructor was excellent, the cooking set-up was very comfortable, the facility is charming, The place is immaculate and charmingly decorated. The owner, Michele, is relaxed with a sly sense of humor. He gave us lots of tips about shopping for spices and other things Moraccan. He also recommended several restaurants which we later enjoyed. Additionally, we lucked out and had classmates who were really fun, which added to the overall experience.The school has a nice van that is clearly marked with the school's name and logo (useful when you are standing in Jema Al Fna square and drivers that go by tell you to get in their car!). I'd suggest not making afternoon plans following the expected class end time because if you are having fun, you and your classmates will want to linger longer. That's what happened in our class. Also, don't plan on a big dinner later that night. You'll be full from consuming your cooking! I bought three bottles of the olive oil made on site (the school is in the middle of an olive grove.) It is awesome tasting and made great gifts. Wish I'd bought more.Overall, it was a really fun experience. It gave us a lovely experience of Marrakesh that was a peaceful contrast to the hectic Medina. And we learned how to make a lot of delicious things."

We were greeted by the friendly and humorous Michel, and given an intro with tea/coffee. The \"guess the spice\" game was lots of fun but also very informative. We then went on to learn how to make bread, delicious salads, Moroccan pancakes and the most amazing chicken tagine with preserved lemons and olives, accompanied with a freshly squeezed mandarin juice and nuts and dried fruit. Michel kept us all entertained with his jokes and drumming and Neeza was a fanatsic teacher, very warm and helpful. After, we sat down to eat our dishes out in the sun with a glass of chilled white wine, and to top it all off we were served a beautifully presented desert of 3 different homemade ice-creams and fruit..AMAZING! A nice extra was learning some little tips, like how to spot real saffron/argan oil and tips for chosing a tagine. To finish we were given the recipes of the dishes we cooked and a little bag of \"68 spice\". The farm also sells their own personalised tagines for a very reasonable price (a quarter of the cost we were offered in the souks!)\u2026we felt alot more confident buying theirs than the souks!A truly enjoyable and rewarding experience and a great way to gain an insight into Moroccan cuisine."

We are a traveling family of 4 and we decided that we would take a cooking class while visiting Marrakech, Morocco. A friend of ours had just taken a class with Faim d\u2019Epices and highly recommended it. When I contacted them and asked if they allowed children (9 &11), they said sure. My hubby and children were unsure of an \"all day\" cooking class and were worried about missing out on other activities. The class from pick up to drop off is approximately 9:30 - 4:00.We wrote all about our experience on our blog, so if you want more details and photos that is where to find them. The class is located out on a farm in a gorgeous building equipped to hold cooking classes. The entire family was dazzled by our host Michel and the full day of activities. This isn't just about cooking, it is learning about the ingredients, the history and Moroccan culture. That was an unexpected treat for us all. Not only did we learn but there was an element of fun and playfulness throughout the day. We danced to music, we snapped photos, we cooked bread, 3 salads, a tajine main dish as well as Moroccan crepes. Our day the main dish was a choice of chicken or fish, so we chose 2 and 2. Check out their site for all of the dishes that are offered each day.I was amazed at the care they took with the kids, for me it was hands off and the kids did great. They even provided a lower cooking / prep station for them to reach. I think they loved boxing the bread dough. I would recommend for age 9 and up (depending on maturity) as they do handle knives and chop vegetables.The best part... you get to eat it all. Our class of 12 all sat down together and enjoyed our creations. It has been a week since the class and the kids are still raving about it. They want to make the dishes at home on their own. :-) The price is great for a full day out and a wonderful meal. You can also add a Hammam and Massage to your package. After the cooking day, they will take you on to the next services. We didn't opt for this, as the kids wouldn't have enjoyed the massage. I can't recommend this experience enough. The entire family learned so much and is eager to cook and try new things. We plan to share a video or our experience on our youtube channel later in Feb 2014."

Michel was a fun host who kept things moving along and we enjoyed the guess the ingredient activity. This course runs in a dedicated cooking class facility and will appeal to the who want more than just a 'watch what I do' type of experience.

The spice identification \"game\" was twice the length it should have been. had we started cooking sooner then we'd have had lunch at lunchtime and not 3pm! Everyone who I know thats been there has cooked the bloody chicken and olive tagine. If it's you too, avoid the ransid butter - it stinks and makes the tagine bitter and virtually inedible. We ended up picking at the chicken and eating the bread we made to stave off the hinger. Fortunately we got back in to the city and were able to locate a McDonalds soone enough. Never has it tasted so good.Nevertheless it was a fun day, just long and tedious at times. Its about 30 mins outside the City so be prepared for a long transfer there and back.

If we hadn't been in a group out to have a fun day out, the day would have been very dull. We baked bread on a stove and then cooked a Chicken tagine. Michel, the owner, didn't do any cooking with us - it was left to the lovely Nehza who was great. I'm not sure why Michel was actually there!!!! However, the food we cooked tasted disgusting (not only mine but all of us). I think it might be an idea to adapt the recipe for non-Moroccans - the rancid butter ingredient spoiled the whole taste. There was too much unnecessary banter from Michel without which we could have done the course in half the time. Would I recommend it - No. I'm sorry I can't be more positive but I'm sure there are much better cookery schools in Marrakesh where you might actually learn something.

Michel and his crew at Faim d'Epices have designed a masterclass in homestyle Moroccan cuisine, wrapped it up with a fun and a frolicsome flare, and set it in a gorgeous small-production farm amidst olive and citrus groves. If you've managed to make it through their doors and found yourself stationed behind one of their tangines\u2026you might just be holding the key to the best souvenir Marrakech (and perhaps all of Morocco) can offer. Pick-up and transfer is seamless, as Michel practically arrives right at your riad's front door to whisk you out of the medina. From there, Michel breaks the ice with a riotous game of \"blindfolded\" guess the spice (can you find the rancid butter?) and offers tips on how to spot fakes in the medina (argan, saffron). There are several fantastic demos on how to make all those swoon-worth Moroccan salads, and the class even gets to their hands at making \"batbout\", or pan-cooked flatbread. Then comes the main course.For us, that was beef tagine in a sauce of candied pears and oranges. If that sounds ridiculously delicious to you, multiply your notion by 100 and you will come somewhat close. THIS is what Morocco tastes like, these are the smells you've caught wafting up from the souk spice markets and from deep within the riad kitchens across the medina. If you want to understand the methodology of how the country's best cooks draw out the full complexity of flavors on offer, start here at Faim d'Epices. As you enjoy the lunch you've just prepared out in the orchards with a glass of red or white, you'll be forgiven for trying to figure out how exactly you're going to squeeze a giant terra-cotta vessel into your hand luggage so you can cook like this again!"

Michel is also a bit of a comedian so there is not a dull moment!This is really a one full day activity and not a half-day as advertised. Not that we mind!"

Michel, the host, is very welcoming and a good laugh and also very knowledgeable so i would definitely recommend doing this trip at the start of your time in Marrakesh, if for no reason other than to give you a better chance of not getting ripped off in the souks! The cooking might be too basic for some but im sure everyone would learn something especially when it comes to the blind smell test of the spices! Excellent value for money as you get to eat a lot throughout the day too.We were on our honeymoon and Michel very generously gave us a wedding gift just to top off an excellent day!Cant recommend it enough. Entertaining, educational and nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the old town! Thank you."

There is actually not too much to do in Marrakech (souks in other cities are much nicer and cheaper). When I consulted trip advisor this came up as the number 1 thing to do in Marrakech. My husband and I booked for the cooking & spa combo. After reading some of the reviews our expectations were very high. This place did not disappoint. Extremely professionally run from the branded van that picked us up, to the printed recipes and entire set up of the cooking school was incredible. The food was the best quality we had in morocco in our whole trip."

This was a brilliant dayfor a taste of Moroccan cooking and the ultimate in relaxation at the spa afterwards. Michele was great and very inclusive in the day at the cookery school. Picked us up bang on time at our hotel. The cookery class was great- lots of fun and really relaxing. Having returned home now we can safely say the food we cooked here was the best we tasted in the week we were in Marrakech.... I would like to think that's because we are great cooks but I think its more to do with the brilliant guidance we had in home cooking! We did lamb with prunes then ate it in the evening warmth before we were taken to have a Hamman in Marrakech. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to taste proper home made Moroccan food. Since we returned home we have had recipes and photographs of our experience sent to us. Brilliant. A long but very relaxing day. x"

Might just be me, but I didn't think it was all that.The good bits:It's well organised. You are picked up from your hotel, taken to the farm and dropped off back at your hotelThe lady who demonstrates the dishes is very good. When it's your turn to recreate the dishes, she's very clear and patient which isn't easy to do when there's a fair number of people in the classYou'll find out some interesting things about how to assess the authenticity of saffron and argon oilLearning how to chop an onion morroccan style was greatThe disappointing bits:The host Michel feels that he is the entertainment. Whilst very pleasant, I found the 'hamming\" it up an attention seeking a bit tiring (playing the bongos whilst we were kneading bread was a bit much for me)Might just be me, others found him fun, but he certainly put everyone at ease. The cookery is basic, so if you want to do something a little more challenging, this won't be for you.I thought the food we cooked was very bland. We also cooked it to death, so it was overdone and slightly burnt at the bottom.....it's not great when you have to eat your efforts.Would I recommend it to others? If you're only in Marrakech for a few days, no, you could spend your time better elsewhere. But if you're in Marrakech for a while and want to do something different and you're not a real foodie or cook, then maybe"

There was 10 of us in the class and they took time out to check that we were ok with the food that we were cooking and offer a helping hand when we got stuck! We made a lamb and prune tagine which was delicious and we enjoyed this along with our moroccan breads and salads outside in the sun (though it was a bit windy!) amongst the orange trees and olive groves. If you have a day to spare in marrakech, I would recommend this worthwhile and enjoyable experience. Looking forward to trying out the recipes at home!Visited November 2013"

The driver picked us up from Jemaa El Fna's post office and we were excited for the cooking course and the spa afterwards. (It was a set deal about 100 Euros per person) The menu was \"tagine with veal and artichokes\" accompanied by flat bread and Moroccan salads. Michel was a great host and explained us about spices and helped us throughout the course. The artichokes are extremely difficult to peel, but the dish we made was one of the best tagines I had in my trip! It was great sitting outside under the sun in December (as we traveled from Denmark) eating tasty food surrounded by great company. We also did a spa afterwards as mentioned before at Mythic Oriental Spa which took about 3 hours in total. We were out the whole day from 9:30 to 20:00 so prepare for a long day and do eat breakfast before attending the cookery course. We assumed we were eating at around 12:00ish but we ended up starving and ate around 15:00.

I had never been to a cookery class before and appreciated the fact that they were good-humoured when I hacked my artichoke to pieces,losing most of the good bits in the process!

Between so many resources online and in print for cooking tajines, one can figure it out really easily. If it can be made on a make shift grill in the middle of an open square, it can be done in an well-equipped personal kitchen with Internet access. This class is about the experience. It's lovely to be able to sit down and get lectured on spices. I love the smell test- I would have failed if we were graded- but it really brings out an appreciation of the nuances and flavors. There's a sense of being at home as soon as we walked in and were greeted by Michel. And to get the insider scoop on prices or tips to shopping was a bonus. The facilities are gorgeous and well made. Eating outside by the garden was just the way to enjoy the climate. I lucked out in having such a cheerful group of classmates. I could let my guard down and not worry about pretending to ignore people shouting at me \"You! From (fill in the blank with a random country)?\" or \"Madam! Hello! Where from? Come see tanneries\" and mingle with other people. I appreciated that we started with demonstrations, then got to try, especially in making bread. Overall, it wasn't really so much on how to cook, but to just have fun and enjoy the day over food. The lessons were presented well to appreciate the Moroccan cuisine as well and but easy to know how to apply the techniques and recipes to your own home kitchen once you leave. My main take away lessons from this class: - How to slice an onion! - How to knead bread- And I covet a massive clay plate like theirs for breadmaking!"

All the food was fantastic and I look forward to getting home and cooking authentic morrocan food for my family and friends. We also got to learn all about the spices used in morrocan food. All in all a wonderful day, highly recommended!"

The atmospherewas so fun and chilled. We cooked the tagine which was delicious. We were taught lots of hints and tips that I am defiantly going to use now I am back home. All the stafg were ao welcoming. We got to sut and relax in the garden at the end of the day and eat out food which was gorgeous. Michel is a fabulous host. Guarenteed to make you laugh. Was definitely a highlight of the trip and I would recommend anyone to do it. It really is not to be missed. Just check out all the other reviews.

The owner and organiser Michel is a very nice and very funny man, who had us laughing throughout the day. He picks you up from your place, and takes you to the farm, before giving you a lesson in Moroccan spices. Cooking is taught by Nezha, who shows you how to make Moroccan bread, salad, crepes and tagine with expertise, then helps you attempt to recreate her work. There are a few good surprises along the way, and the day ends with the chance to eat all the food outside in the beautiful gardens. Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Merci beacoup Michel! BenP.s. I think it cost 50euros, and unlike almost everything else in Marrakech, there were no hidden extras (e.g. the coffees etc are complimentary). This was a welcome change!"

It appeared that vegetable couscous and lamb or chicken targine were the staple offering for the tourists. However Morrocan food is much more than this as we discovered at Faim de'Epices. Michel the swave Frenchmen, our host, and Nezha our chef/teacher for the day were outstanding, entertaining and made our day. To be completely honest the food we cooked here was the best food we sampled in Morroco and we ate in some supposedly renowned restaurants that at best we're average and expensive for Morrocan standards. We would not hesitate to recommend attending this cooking school for an educational, fun, value for money day away from the hassle of the Marrekech people who are endlessly trying to rip you off."

The trip from the Hotel Du Golf took 1 hour, through the old city, through the new city, past a huge olive plantation and finally down a very bumpy dirt road. The interior of the house was pleasantly cool and cleverly arranged. The 6 of us had our own cooking stations and individual attention. After learning about spices, we watched how the bread dough is prepared. Later, we had a chance to practice what we learned. Made our own bread, prepared our own chicken lemon tagine and watched how to make 3 different salads. We ate what we had cooked on the back porch overlooking the lemon grove and were served a lovely wine and an interesting dessert. It was past 5pm when we got home after a very fun day that was well worth the 550 Dh"

Michel, the host, is very entertaining and our cook was very sweet. We watched a few demonstrations before having a spice test, which was really fun - it's amazing what you think you know about spices when you can't see what you're smelling! We then learned to make bread which was rather entertaining, and made our tagines, before watching a few more salad / crepe demonstrations and finally all sat out together to enjoy our meal at the end of the day. We were out from 9.30 and got back to our riad at about 5pm, so make sure you book with spending the whole day there in mind.As a fairly seasoned cook, I didn't find the course too difficult, but it was an interesting insight into traditional Moroccan cooking. I will definitely take the recipes away and try them at home.All in all it was great value and a fun day."

We were both very pleasantly surprised from the moment we arrived on the property (we were picked up at our riad), to first meeting Michel, to commencing our class and to eating what we had cooked ourselves. We were skillfully guided through each step, so that our recipe of fresh Moroccan lamb tagine served with vegetables, bread and salads (with a little wine), was successful. So much so, that that meal became our standard during the rest of our stay. It was by far the best meal we had in Marrakech, including a very expensive, exclusive one at Riad MK! Michel was enjoyable and entertaining, the facility (farm) beautiful, the class itself was fun and relaxing. In particular, Michel's honed recipes and spices are a perfect blend that are memorable. The little souvenirs we were sent away with at the end of the day, were an additional professional touch. It is clear a lot of thought and planning went into this entire enterprise. Michel got it right and clearly loves sharing it. We highly recommend taking this class as part of your Moroccan experience. It will surely go down as one of your highlights.

Great for those who want to learn about Morrocan food and cuisine in a fun and relaxed environment. (The other obvious option would be La Marison Arab - which we stayed at - although I didn't attend a cooking workshop, I was able to see it in action. It looked very professional but not more sterile and serious.) Even for those that are not accomplished cooks (as with my partner Mr N and one of the other visitors in our group from New York), it is still a very enjoyable way to spend your day. Even Mr N, who can barely boil a packet of dried pasta, was able to execute a perfectly tasty lamb and almond-stuffed figs tangine. The venue is actually some way out of the Medina, but the transport is organised in advance and is comfortable and punctual. It turns out that being away from the hustle and bustle of central Marrakech was an unexpectedly nice surprise. As exotic and alluring as the Medina is, after spending a few days there, it is refreshing and comforting to be able to spend a bit of time in the country away from the chaos. The host, Michel, is enormsly friendly, caring and loads of fun!"

I wasn't sure she'd view spending a day cooking as a great holiday activity but she loved it! Picked up in a nice vehicle, on time and near our Riad and after picking up another couple drove about 10 miles out of the city into the surprisingly green countryside. Was greeted by Michel, the cool Frenchman who runs the place. The instruction was given by a lovely Morrocan lady (sorry, I've forgotten her name) who was extremely patient and instructive. Michel hovered in the background assisting and entertaining. In the middle of our cooking the radio came on and Michel started on his bongos! Surreal but very entertaining and apropos!We cooked a beef tagine with veg, bread and a sweet and later in the day this was consumed eagerly on the cool veranda overlooking the fields. Michel is a very interesting 'joker'. He will have a 'pop' at English cooking (okay with me as I'm Welsh;-) but is just as quick to mock aspects of 'Frenchness'. Had a great conversation with him out on the veranda.Since returning to Wales Michel has sent our 'certificates' translated into Welsh...how thoughtful is that!!! A great day out and a complete contrast to the madness of Marrakech. Bought one of Michel's lovely tagine dishes and with the recipes provided by Michel am looking forward to putting my new 'skills' to the test.Merci / Shokran Michel and crew for a great day out!"

So any chance you get to experience what is in fact an amazing place with the assistance of a guide (that happens to also be quite the entertainer) is paramount. Important though is that the experience isn't too removed from what makes Marrakech, Marrakech, in this case food. This and more is the experience Michel and his team at L'atelier Faim d'Espices offer. It's an experience to treasure and remember every time you attempt to repeat it back home. Be it recalling the smell of herbs and spices, combining beef with pear and orange (something this naive chef would never have attempted beforehand and yes that means that your cooking ability is irrelevant) or doing it all to the accompaniment of live bongos! Ok enough spoilers from me. Do not leave Marrakech without doing this class! Alison and Michael from Australia"

Second, the hands-on experience of making the various dishes is important and Michel is an excellent teacher. Finally, the class ends with eating the meal and it is absolutely delicious,,,(better than what we had eaten in some of the better Morrocan restaurants.)

The staff is super friendly and very accommodating. It's a great deal for the price they charge, do not hesitate taking this course!"

One of the main reasons we chose Morocco as a destination was for the food and what better way to learn about it than to cook it? Based on the positive reviews I read, Faim d'Epices seemed to be a logical place to start and the experience exceeded our expectations. There was something for everyone, our group included a vegetarian and another who is not an enthusiastic cook as well as keen amateur chefs and the patient guidance and demonstration by Nehza ensured that all our dishes were correctly cooked and tasty to eat. The spice workshop was very informative and Michel's easy going manner made it loads of fun. It is definitely worth making the time to attend a class here, a big thank you to all at Faim d'Epices for making our day!"

Now I did this cooking day 'cause the boyfriend wanted to have a cookery lesson in Morocco, and friend's recommendation, ( like why waste time in a kitchen was what I thought....?!), but was won over by the welcoming sense of individuality, organised set up and even if I say so myself...delicious fish tagine ( you could choose different meals on different days) and handmade bread that we made! It feels homely rather than corporate and was a welcome fun reasonably priced experience in the often mad bustling in-your face Marrakech. Don't hesitate."

My daughter is vegetarian so it was great that she was catered for so well in the cookery lesson. Michel and his team are knowledgeable, helpful, skilled, warm, friendly and have a fantastic sense of humour. As we shared the day with a slightly dizzy bunch of 'young upwardly mobile professionals' the humour came in very handy.The knowledge we gained was extremely valuable and although my daughter and I have been cooking for many years, we learned a few new, very useful tips and techniques. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed and the back room staff quietly efficient. I can wholeheartedly recommend this venue and if you do decide to book, don't buy your oils, spices and souvenirs before you have visited - wait until you get there as they are very reasonable and better quality than you may find in the souks"

We talked about our adventures and I discovered Michel (the owner of Faim d'Epices) gave me information about Argan Oil that my friends had not received on their tour! He explained true Argan Oil verses watered down Argan Oil! I think I got the better deal, lol ! I plan to return to this part of world, so \"Michel\" I will see you again at some point in life! Keep the business alive :)I forgot to add! I took a portion of my meal with me to share with my friends and the owner of the Riad Bamilike in Marrakech! They loved it !!!! Michel also had this display of leather belts from his neighbor, I bought 2 of them! I can't stop getting compliments on the belst!

It was very important for us to know what ingredients going into the dishes and the main cooking techniques. I usually do not eat much couscous, but after learning the proper way to make some from the beginning, it became very spiritual. Handmade couscous taste much better than 5 minutes instant ones. I was so pleased with myself in the end of the class~Michel was great host and his team in L'atelier Faim d'Epices were all excellent! The Studio was very clean, team members always look after us after every stage of cooking. Michel talked through all different spices, let us know a lot of them. It was very educational. Now me and my husband can confidently make our own Moroccan dishes at home.It was great time to spend outside Marrakech city, chill out in the countryside. Cooking, laughing and relaxing.Thanks to L'atelier Faim d'Epices, gave us such memorable time in Marrakech!"

Super guy- very knowledgeable about anything we asked him about. The food we cooked was amazing- probably one of the better tajines we ate on our trip to Morocco. I think you'd be happy with any of the menus though. The cooking is not challenging,. and Nezha, the cook, walks you through each step, so no worries if you don't actually know what you're doing. In the class you learn how to make your own bread, by demonstration, then go at it on your own. Pretty cool process and it's interesting to see that they cook the bread on the stove top rather than in the oven (easy to do back home!). You then learn about local spices- this was very informative. I cook quite a lot at home and thought I would know every one, but once you are blindfolded it's amazing to see just how little you know ;) Michele spoke at length about each spice- we learnt a lot about saffron and argon which was very interesting. I didn't know much about either of these items and was happy to have been educated. You then watch a demonstration on how to make salads. I would have preferred to do this on my own...or in small groups. I am very hands on and the cooking was not at all challenging, so it would have been nice to try my hand at another dish. This is an excellent company to go with- I was very happy with my decision. Great communication via email as well.I cannot wait to try the recipes on myown at home. If they turn out half as good I'll be delighted. One recommendation- it would be fun to do a small amount of time in a local market. I can see the logistical issues with this, but it is still fun to have a guide walk you through how the locals shop."

Michel then introduced us, through a fun blind sniff test, to the Moroccan spices and blends that we would use to cook. I failed miserably but learnt a lot. Then we moved on to our individual cooking stations all prepped and ready to go. We observed how to blend, punch and pull the flour to make the bread and then it was our turn. Making the bread was just hilarious, watching each other punching and pulling the dough was comical. Step by step we all prepared our Tagines, some did chicken and others fish. While they were cooking, we learnt how to make the side dishes that would compliment our finished Tagines. We followed Michel to his private farm at the back and enjoyed a cold drink and the cool breeze. When we returned, the table was set and awaiting our finished Tagines. I must say, we all did a great job, they looked and smelt amazing and tasted delicious.

My husband an I were coming to Marrakesh for our first wedding anniversary and wanted to do something different that the standard 'touristy' attractions. We found this cooking workshop and decided to go for it. From the time of booking, we felt that we will have a great day with Michel and Nezha. We were picked up from the agreed location in Medina by a signed transfer car and we knew we are in safe hands (a photo was provided what car will pick us up). We were driven outside of Marrakesh to the beautiful farm where we were very welcomed by Michel.A workshop was well thought through and very well delivered. It wasn't too long or too short, but just perfect timing. We learned how to make authentic Moroccan bread, crepes and beautiful salad. The main dish of the day was 7 Vegetable couscous. We chose this day in particular because my husband never enjoyed having couscous for lunch/dinner at home and we felt that after this course he might change his mind. And so he did. He said that this was the best dish he had in Marrakesh for the duration of our stay. We also enjoyed spices workshop (we were not very good at it but had lots of fun guessing). Michel was amazing at explaining the difference between the real 'thing' and fake. We also bought some argan oil and saffron from the trustworthy source - their in-house shop for very generous price. At the end of the workshop we were provided with all the recipes and a little present - their own unique combination of spices. I must say that i have cooked some beef at home and used the seasoning - it is amazing! I would highly recommend to visit Michel and Nezha and learn all they have to give and take it away and use it. You will not be disappointed. Have fun!Neringa"

He was chatty, full of lots of facts and very friendly. We earnt about spices, cooked breads, parathas, a fish tagine, salads and learnt an easy way to chop onions! I would thoroughly recommend this as a great day to break up your holiday and its good value for the price you pay."

Following the rave reviews on Trip advisor, my friend and I decided to book ourselves into the one day course at the beginning of our 4 night stay in Marrakech and it was for me the highlight of our trip. Michel came to collect us from our hotel and took us out of the city to this little oasis. Where we not only learnt how to cook wonderful food, and eat it afterwards on the terrace but we had a wonderful spice smelling session using blacked out Ray Bans!! Great and very entertaining way to learn a lot about Morrocan life. On top of that though Michel and his lovely wife gave us lots of great advice and tips of where to eat and where to avoid in the city and we had our best fish supper on the main square thanks to them. We came away feeling really prepared to hit the souks the following day and were so grateful for all their help. We were also given the recipes to take away afterwards and I have made the tagine and aubergine salad a couple of times since with rave reviews this end from family and friends. This really is the best day trip and well worth every penny!! Thanks so much to you Michel and your fabulous team!! We will be back!!"

We called and e-mailed Michel and he was very prompt with his responses and ensured that we were completely aware of the proceedings for the day. On the day we were collected on time near our Riad in a clearly marked Van which was good and gave us a good peace of mind. We then picked up a other couples and made our way to the farm, There we were greeted by Michel(owner) and Neezha(cooking instructor) and treated to a mint tea. The cooking course itself covered how to make Moroccan Bread, Lamb Tajine(depends on which day) and we were also shown how to make different Salads. It was explained very well throughout and we were well looked after. We had also the opportunity to eat what we had prepared and later were driven to the Spa. The Spa was a perfect way to finish an overall amazing Day where we learned a lot of things and were made to feel very welcome by Michel."

(as you will experience when you visit!!) Alongside being very fun and relaxing it is also a cultural learning experience. The dishes you learn to make are all very well explained and demonstrated, varying degrees of difficulty depend on which day you visit, we made a fish tagine as well as breads, marinades, pancakes.. Just a wonderful day filled with so many memories! Thank you to Michel and the team, the food was delicious, the atmosphere amazing and the people were the icing on the cake It truly is worth every single penny!

I'm not sure I can add more detail than what has already been shared by other excellent ratings, but the overall experience was a wonderful change of pace to busy Marrakech. Michel is a wonderful host and although I am an avid recreational chef, I learned quite a bit of technique and information on ingredients and Morrocon cooking. The meal was wonderful (although way too much for one person to eat) and the day was relaxing. My advice would be to schedule this in the middle of your Marrakech stay as a wonderful retreat. I wish my family was travelling with me as they would have loved it."

You will learn about all different spices. Also you recieve the recipe of the meal you cooked that day.Just generally a great day of fun.In addition if you go onto the Faim d'Epices website and talk to Michel direct you can also have a relaxing spa straight after of which you are dirven to when finished eating.

The place where the class is held is very big and light, airy, immaculately clean and relaxed but organized to a T. The first thing on arrival is a welcome drink, which gave us time to break the ice and meet our fellow food aficionados. Next came a demonstration on making Moroccan flat bread by the accomplished Nezha. Afterward we had our blind smelling session guided by Michel, who is very laid back but conveys intense passion for the spices and their uses. Then we got to the hands-on part, donnig aprons and making our own bread and starting on our tagines. The work stations were very comfortable and all the utensils and ingredients were set out, making it easy to follow Nezha's instructions. Both she and Michel came round to check how we were doing and give advice where needed. After that we had a demonstration on how to make salads, followed by last additions to the tagines and baking the bread. My husband, who NEVER goes into the kitchen managed very well (had I known sooner...) and we ate the bread he made for lunch, with our tagines, out on the porch overlooking the olive trees, with a lovely glass of wine and conversation. Just a lovely, lovely day, far from the overcrowded, frantic city.Thanks to Michel, his lovely wife Ilam, Nezha and all the staff.

This is a great and memorable experience for understanding the cuisine and excellent value! You are provided with the recipe and tips for re-creating when back home! You also have the opportunity to buy the spices used and various other gifts at a great and reliable price.

At the end o day we ate the food in his garden before getting dropped off in town or in our case at the spa. Very enjoyable day and good value if booked as part of the spa package."

This experience was really funny, we learned to cook some special foods, like cous cous, tagin or special salads. I suggest this experience to everyone wants to know the local culinary tradicions."

He picked us up at our hotel at exactly 9:50 as promised and drove us to the farm. We met an enjoyable mixture of couples from France, Germany, Ireland and Chile. The school was spotless and well prepared for us and somewhat unique ( how many cooking schools have a jukebox?) The blind spice testing was quite a learning experience. We were entertained by Michael's drumming to the music as we pulled and \"boxed\" the dough for our bread. We made a great traditional chicken tanjine and three different salads. We enjoyed the fruits of our labor at the end of the day and were taken back to our hotel at 5:00. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an easy introduction to traditional Moroccan cooking. An appreciation of wine wouldn't hurt either."

Michel picked us up from our Villa on the other side of Marrakech and drove us to the farm which made a lovely change to the hustle and bustle of the medina. The spice test was fascinating and Michel's tips for spotting fake herbs and oils very useful. Under Nezah's clear instruction we somehow produced delicious tajines, breads salads and crepes which we enjoyed with a glass of wine outside. After the course Michel dropped us at the Mystic Spa for our Hamman and massage. This was the perfect follow up to our meal and after massages ee were lead up to the rood with a pot of mint tea and baklava - heaven!I can not recommended this experience highly enough; thank you Michel and team - we will be back again on Cous cous day :)"

I really enjoyed the spice lesson and I have already made one of the salads at home.

Michel, the proprietor, is one of life's characters and he ensures that the programme keeps everyone engaged throughout. Instruction is good and everyone spoke excellent English, with idiom.The day is very good value; the price included collection from our hotel, the course, snacks and drinks, and, of course, a late leisurely lunch with the food we had cooked and a glass of wine. We booked through the tripadvisor guide (get your guide) this worked well but I'm convinced that we would have got a better price if we had booked direct with Michel by e-mail.A great alternative to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech."

The booking was really easy and we were promised fun, which is definitely what we got. I\u2019d recommend doing this day before you hit the souks. During the spice test (wicked fun) Michel showed and told us how to spot flake Argan oil and Saffron as well as the prices you should be paying. I did a cookery course at La Maison Arabe (also a fantastic day) last time I was in Marrakech which included a market and spice shop tour. I definitely learned more about the spices and how they were used at L'atelier Faim d'Epices and didn\u2019t have the shop sales pitch at the end. If you\u2019re in the souks you\u2019ll see the meat and vegetable markets anyway, so you\u2019re not missing out. Getting out of the hustle and bustle of the city to the farm is a great bonus!We made bread, Moroccan crepes and a delicious beef artichoke and pea tagine \u2013 great and very memorable tips from Nezha with music and drumming from Michel while we cooked. I\u2019d recommend that you have a good breakfast before you go. We sat down to eat our lunch mid afternoon \u2013 we had plenty of snacks on the way, but you definitely eat after normal lunchtime. Expected the unexpected and lots of fun. Michel\u2019s purpose with the business seems to be ensuring you have a fun and enjoyable day and learning experience \u2013 he certainly delivers. Customer service before, during and after the day is second to none. We felt like we were leaving friends by the end of the day and would definitely go back."

A lovely warm welcome from Michel and his staff - Michel is entertaining to say the least! Booking arrangements were very straight forward and our transport to and from the venue was included in the price. This one day course is suitable for those interested in cooking at all levels. The day we took part, Michel was translating everything fluently into three languages - jokes included! A friend had previously attended this course - their recommendation was spot on!Since returning home, I have attempted everything demonstrated on the day successfully. I was so motivated that I went straight to the supermarket to buy the necessary ingredients before attending to my unpacking! The lesson on spices was fascinating and has encouraged me to use more in my cooking. The tip on how to chop an onion at top speed is a skill which will stay with me for life! There isn't much time to fit anything else into the day however we took advantage of the Cooking/Spa deal on offer - an equally good move as I had one of the best massages ever!It was a lovely surprise to receive a follow up email from Michel once we came back with a photograph, certificate and even more recipes. A really nice touch! This business venture has been cleverly thought through!Would I repeat the day on my next trip to Marrakech? Definitely!"

Really good value for money - you receive an intimate cooking class, shared by only 8 people, cook on your own cooker to make your own tagine, make breads and side dishes and eat your meal that you have cooked in the sun with your fellow cooks. Michel is really generous and gives offerings of spices and additional recipes at the end of the class. Included in the cost is transport to the cooking school (some reviews have said the cooking lesson should start at 9am - who the hell wants to get up so early on their HOLIDAY?? Being picked up at 9.30 and starting the class at 10am suited us just fine). Michel is a real character and starts with a clever spice test and then onto the cooking, which was incredibly enjoyable and delicious. So glad we did this activity."

Booking was easy and unlike a lot of the other cooking schools I contacted, Michel didn't expect you to send credit card information via email to book which seemed a bit safer to me. Michel was a great host and the Moroccan cook was brilliant. I felt that we learned more than I had in previous cooking classes - actually took some skills away rather than just following a recipe so that was really good :) We made the lamb and prune tagine and everything was lovely. We only had 3 days in Marrakech, so it was a bit long to fit in. The class itself is not too long but it's quite a drive and also there is a bit of down time during at the end of the class. We got back not long before 5pm so we were a bit disappointed as we had planned to visit some attractions that closed at 5.30pm. Other than that one small thing though, it was a truly lovely day. Maybe consider booking one of the classes in the medina if you are short on time like us."

You don't have to be a five star Michelin chef to attend this course but in the same time if you wish to have a lovely day with a friend, your partner, your family or alone it is the best activity that you can do when in Marrakech. This is a lovely family business run by Michel and Nezha. Michel does the easy bit which is making you feel comfortable. As a true Frenchman with excellent English he will ensure that from booking of the course to the departure back to your accommodation you will feel like a King. During my 7 day trip to Morroco, we booked a day with Faim d' Epices. The response was via e-mail and Michel was able to support a slightly different menu due to my girlfriend not keen on lamb. A shuttle was waiting at our hotel ON TIME ( This is a luxury in Morocco) and we were taken to a nice location about 10 minutes outside the city center. Michel and his team was there to welcome us with his team with fresh mint tea and lovely coffee. In our session we had another 8 people from other countries which made the whole experience really nice. The class was very relaxed, we started with the demonstration on how to make Khobz (bread) by Nezha and we then repeated the steps under her supervision in our own private hob. Each hob is shared between two people so everyone gets involved. After Khobz we did a test of our sense of smell. Michel explained the usage of spices in the local cuisine and we had to sample a few and figure out their names while having our eyes shut. A little bit of challenge for few...... In addition to this Michel did give us a lot of tips on how to chose spices when buying them locally as there are lots of scams ( for example fake saffron) in order to capitalise on the hype. After the spices, we did 3 different salads with Nezha using local materials. The main part of the course is how to do a nice tangine and each day there is a different recipe. We all did Lamb except my gf who did beef and one other fellow who did vegetables only. The meat took some time to cook and under the supervision of Nezha we were able to produce a magnificent dish. At the end we all sat down outside in the garden and shared the food. Desserts and coffee followed up.In conclusion, we were given the recipes, a sample of Ras el hanout, a certificate, photos and lots of good memories. As a customer, there is nothing else left to ask. The team put their heart into this business and this is purely reflected by the comments of their clientele and repeated business. My advice do not leave Marrakech without attending their course ! A must do !"

BUT overall a lovely start to our 4 days in Marrakech.Only other word of warning - if you take the spa add on, then get some commitment in advance that you have a definite timeslot - we were kept waiting an hour and ended up walking out.

During my holiday in Marrakech me and my brother decided to go on a cooking class.The class took place on a farm 30 minutes outside of the centre of Marrakech. The organisers arranged to pick us up from close to our Riad. We were welcomed by Michel and his wife. The course started with an introduction and some mint tea.Afterwards Nezha, the chef, took over to demonstrate how to make traditional flatbread. The only ingredients were semolina, white flour, water, yeast and salt. The rest of the magic was boxing and stretching. We all had the opportunity to try and make our own flatbread. First we prepared the dough and then we left it to rise. In the meanwhile we started to prepare the main dish. On our course on Saturday the main dish was the tagine of red olives and preserved olives. I first thought i would not like this combination, however I have to say it was probably the best food I have had in Marrakech. Once the tagine was prepared, we cooked the bread in a frying pan. During the course we watched Nezha on how to make three different styles of moroccan salad. In-between Michel gave us some information about spices. He also filled us in the secret of how to find out if Argan oil or Saffron are fake. Michel was a brilliant host and always tried to make us welcome. He offered us fresh orange juice and nuts during the course. Everything worked perfectly together and it made the course a brilliant experience. At the end of the course Nezha showed us how to do the traditional layer crepes which are always served for breakfast. The grand final of our cooking class was the meal. The tagine and the flat bread turned out to be fantastic. Michel served us some moroccan white wine. As a dessert he served some self-made ice cream with crepes. For everyone who wanted there was a little shop on the premisses. The prices were fair and the products obviously high quality.Me and my brother loved this cooking class and would like to thank the whole team again for this experience. They really tried hard to make this day very special for everyone involved. This class is well organised and is giving a brilliant insight into the moroccan cuisine. Would I go there again? YES! Would I recommend it to my friends? DEFINITELY YES."

Getting to the venue was easy, as I was picked up from the main square and dropped off at the same place at the end of the day. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning to cook the moroccan way. The lesson is suitable for beginners and expert cooks alike!!Naheed - Cardiff"

I had fun, thanks also to Michel being a knowledgeable and attentive host, learned about spices and a few good tips to spot fake saffron and argan oil. But most importantly it was a good learning experience, with a lot of actual practical time spent preparing the food. Nothing too complicated (fish tajine, salads, bread and moroccan crepes) but genuinely traditional moroccan food. Everything was perfect from the pick up at Djemaa El Fna, the location, the atmosphere, the teaching and, of course, the food! Highly recommended!"

No need to be concerned! From a light hearted education session on spice identification, to the coolest way to finely chop onions, we were ALL captivated from start to finish. Including Moroccan bread making, salad construction, the right way to use the tagine, all resulted in a delicious finale where we consumed the results of our labours in the gardenOur 13 year old son repeated the recipe last weekend to much oohing & ahhhing from our guests. You will find your hosts charming, well informed & focused on ensuring you have a good time."

From the time we were picked up (on time!), welcomed with tea/coffee and introduction to our day and then led through the day in the very well organized kitchen and cooking stations, to our shared late lunch with wine and dessert served by our host, we enjoyed every part of the event. Great to spend time with someone who truly enjoys what he does and shares his enthusiasm with his guests. Michel's assistant, Nizha, was a great tutor and patient with the many questions she had to field.As it happened, we booked the cooking school and spa experience afterward as a package deal through Faim d'Epices. The spa was excellent as well. Cooking school from 10 to 4 or so, then they took us to the spa afterward for a hammam and massage from 5 to about 8. Best day of our whole trip!"

Ideally it would be great if they could let guests make these as well, as there is plenty of waiting around on the day. Be prepared to take lots of breaks and soak up the sun in their beautiful fruit garden. The staff are absolutely lovely. There is no pressure to buy anything like everywhere else in Marrakech.

Michel is very friendly, witty and laid back and made it clear that the day was to be enjoyed and that there were no time restrictions to worry about. Next on the agenda was the spices workshop which was both fun and interesting, whilst also making you realise how your nose can let you down when trying to identify scents, some of which should be so easy to recognise - our hooters really deceived us at times! The cooking experience itself was absolutely brilliant and very informative, whilst being fun and enjoyable. The end product, a lamb and prune tagine was absolutlely delicious and Nehza was an exceptional teacher who made learning the new techniques very enjoyable - we particularly enjoyed the 'boxing'!. We cooked whilst Michel played his bongos which helped to create a great atmosphere. Once the hard work was done we all sat down together to enjoy our handy work. A truly wonderful day.

Fortunately, there is no cooking experience prerequisite required, so I was perfectly qualified. The class is done in such a way that, despite my culinary ineptitude, I felt perfectly comfortable. Nezha was beyond patient with the students and very informative. Michel's wit and banter keep things light and breezy. I would have gone just to get his lesson on spices. Can't wait to fire up the old tajine and put to use some of our lesson. It goes without saying that there will be several family bread making weekends in our future. A Moroccan themed dinner party is already in the initial planning phase. Thanks to Michel and Nezha, the neighborhood will be impressed."

We were down a little early and the cab drivers/guides told us that they would take us. No we'll wait. Tours were offered and suggestions made by the cabbies.Within a few minutes up pulled a nice van with the name on the side. We hopped in the front seat and there were three other couples in the back.It was at least a 20 minute ride out of the city, near Timbucktoo, but an interesting ride to see a different part of the city. Highway turned to city road to country road with speed bumps, turned to gravel. No speeding and good driving.We arrived at the farm and the owner, Michel, greeted us and invited us into the lobby where our group of 10 sat as he gathered tea or coffee.We introduced ourselves to each other and decided we would have a fun day. A couple from Manchester a little younger than us, their pregnant daughter and her husband, also from Manchester. A newly married couple from London, first grade teacher and website designer. And a couple Stanford grad students, one lived in California and the other Switzerland.Michel was a bit of a character and entertaining. Originally French it took only a little time to get used to his his accent. He spoke clearly and made sure we understood what he was saying. Very knowledgeable on his spices and we had discussions during the day about the country, politics, and the people of Morocco.He explained we would watch bread making, learn about spices while the dough was rising. Make our bread, watch salads be made, cook our beef tagine (kind of a stew), cook our bread, make crepes, then eat.A lot of moving from our cooking station to the demonstration counter. Our instructor, Nazhel, lives in the city and rides her moped out each day, There were a couple staff that did some food prep and stocked and cleared the stations. Very well orchestrated all day.His color is purple as all the accent colors were purple, his hat band, watch, shoes, cushions, and toilet seats were all purple. Even the blacked out sunglasses he made us wear as he held the different spices under our noses. He showed us real saffron and explained why there was no way they had real saffron at the price they offered in the spice shop we visited in the Souks.We ate our labor (not goat) outside, complimented the chefs, had dessert with our crepes and ice cream. We were delivered back to the hotel a little before 5.An excellent way to spend a day in Marrakech!We received our Diploma and some pictures Michel took of us along with more recipies in an email.When you go . . . wear something PURPLE and you will be the teacher's pet!!"

My Partner and I booked the day here based on the reviews seen here and were not disappointed.The whole day was so nicely done, picked up from the Hotel and taken a little way out of the hustle and bustle. Offered mint teas, coffees on arrival nice and chilled out.Michel is a truly great guy who loves what he does and it shows.You will learn to make truly authentic Morroccan food here and it's suitable for all levels in the kitchen. I personally am a chef myself and was amazed by the amount i learnt here. we learned to cook numerous dishes with the help and support of the great staff here, whilst it still being a fun day to be relaxed and enjoyable. Then sitting down to enjoy the meals we cooked at the end of the day, with a glass of wine in the Sun.I would highly recommend this to anyone, Michel and his team do a great job. You even get the recipes to take home with you."

Always a little dubious about booking things abroad we went based on the reviews on here and were not disappointed. Everything went smoothly from the booking to the return to our hotel and everything was on time.When you get picked up you are taken to a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the markets and are surrounded by olive trees on a little farm. The cooking house itself is beautiful, very clean. We were offered drinks on arrival and could look round the small shop. however at no point was there any pressure to purchase anything, tip anyone or anything like that. I will say that the shop was very reasonably priced as well compared to the prices in the souks.The cooking class was easy ti understand and the staff very very helpful and made us all feel welcome and at home. We had an education on spices too where we were blindfolded and had to guess what each spice was by smell... Michel explained about what they were used for and gave us some great tips on spoking fake spices too.After the cooking (where we made traditional bread, Chicken lemon tagine and salads we relaxed in the sun and all ate our food together out by the olive trees, it was beautiful. You also get given the recipes you cooked to take home with you.. please please make this a day that you do when you go to Marrakech"

The location is a bit of the beaten path, however once you arrive, it is lovely to enjoy looking out over the gardens. The structure of the day is very relaxing and varied with demonstration, instruction and hands on prep along with some musical entertainment thrown in. We were fortunate that the weather was pleasant which allowed us to enjoy the fruits of our labour outdoors under the mid afternoon sun. We combined our cooking class with a spa treatment that was arranged by the cooking school. We were delivered by the driver arranged with the school and escorted right to the door. What a great way to spend the day. Thanks for a great experience."

My boyfriend and I decided to do the class at Faim d'Epices at the end of our trip to Marrakech in September 2012 and it was a great decision - we had such a great day! It's easy to get stuck with bland tagines and cous cous found in the square but this day just shows how good real Moroccan food is!The minivan picked us up from our riad and took us to the farm house just ourside marrakech centre. There were only four of us in our group for day being oursleves and two Australian girls. We were met by Michel and some fresh mint tea.There are different recipes each day but we made beef and artichoke tagine, and the traidtional bread, salads and sweet pancakes which are similar each day. Nezha, the chef, is a great teacher and expertly shows you the techniqies needed in her demonstation. We each had our own cooking station to prepare our food and follow Nezha's instructions whilst Michel entertained with some traditional drum playing. The spice 'class' we had with Michel was fun and we all thought we had learnt something from it, including how to spot fake saffron which is sold commonly to tourists!Bring able to relax and enjoy what you've made which soaking up the sun looking at the citrus trees of the farm house is a joy! Michel was a great host and was funny (in a dry French way), informative and generous.At the end of the day he gave us all a souvenir of the recipes we had made that day and some Ras al Hanout to use when we prepare the dishes back at home.We we got back to England we got an email from Michel with some photos of us during the day and some more recipes. What a wonderful experience we had which we would definitely reconmmend. It was good value for money, was professionally run and is something different to do whilst in Morocco/Marrakech. We were definitely relaxed at the end of the day and it was a highlight of our trip."

From our arrival and introductions, to taste tests, cooking lessons and food served in the sunshine, Michel made us feel at home and relaxed. We even got some impromptu bongo drums and some useful info on Morrocan culture, property and lifesytle.The Lessons are easy to follow, the food delicious (best meal we had in Marrakesh!) and the day great fun all round.

The service and friendliness of Michel (the owner) and his team made the daythat bit more special. The day felt like it was personal and just for us which is so so rare especially with many large tour companies.We have just got back from Marrakech having spent a week there in January. We booked this tember via email enquiry in Sep 2012 and everything went to plan. We were picked up from our Riad by Michel who took us to the beautiful farm - being quiet in January it was just us and another couple but the kitchen area was large and spacious and so even if there were lots of you! We had a brilliant lesson of all the different spices and were shown in detail by the WONDERFUL teacher a 3 course meal plus how to make bread! on the day we visited it was fish tagine and its probably one of the best things I have ever tasted!! She was very hands on and really gave personal time to each person ensuring everything was cooked correctly. We enjoyed the sunshine and ate alfresco! We were then driven to the spa and had a lovely relaxing afternoon followed by an hour long massage!!I cannot believe the fantastic value of this day trip - the combination of the wonderful lesson and food followed by an hour long massage was just priceless and for any couple or group of friends I SERIOUSLY SUGGEST YOU DO THIS!!! :) It is 100% worth it and such a treat and it was so nice to get out of the madness of Marrakech for the day!Thank you for leaving us with fantastic memories and a taste of real Morocco - I will be recommending to anyone I know who is visiting! WE WILL BE BACK! :)"

We had researched Morocco before our trip to Marrakech and found this great visitor attraction on Lonely Planet. We then emailed Faim d'Epices (Michel) from our hotel. We were emailed back promptly to arrange what day we wished to attend, and were then collected in their private minibus on the day. On arrival at the farmhouse, some 20 minutes outside the city, we were greeted by Michel and introduced to our teacher for the day, Nezha. Both lovely people! We were made very welcome.The course was a lot of fun! It began with Michel fitting us with dark glasses, and we then had to identify a large number of herbs and spices using the sense of smell. Afterwards we started to cook our meal under the careful guidance of Nezha. This consisted of. Moroccan bread, salads, chicken with red olives & Lemon, and crepes. Whilst we were cooking, Michel provided some entertainment in the form of African music, with which he joined in by playing the bongo's!Later, we enjoyed the fruits of our labours on the patio overlooking the olive and citrus groves. We had a super time, both the food and the company were excellent. Afterwards, we were taken to the Mythic Oriental Spa in the medina for approximately 3 hours of total bliss! This consisted of Moroccan Hammam and massage. I will review this separately later.If you are heading to Marrakech, do this course. It will be a highlight of your visit to Morocco!"

We didn't expect to have such a fantastic time! We learned how to make a delicious beef tagine in a really welcoming atmosphere - there was coffee or peppermint tea on arrival and Michel explained the day ahead for us. There was a group of about 10 of us and we generally all spoke English (we got the feeling we'd been put in a group together for this reason) and some people could clearly cook well and others were just there for a day out. I'm not a great cook but I enjoy cooking and Faim d'Epices definitely caters for all levels. We started making our bread after a wonderful lesson with one of Michel's team - they help you every step of the way after the lesson to make sure you're on track. Once the bread was left to rise we started making our tagine. Each of us had our own cooking station (each station has two hobs and chopping space) so my fiance and I could work next to each other. The most entertaining part of the day was the blind 'smelling' test of spices. We were tested on our knowledge of all sorts of regular and exotic spices and given some good (and also hilarious) advice about buying saffron and argan oil etc. Michel is a natural entertainer and the whole atsmophere is really relaxed. We had some fresh orange juice and snacks before learning how to make a range of fresh Moroccan salads and then we finished off our tagine. Our tagines were served on a long table in the beautiful surroundings of olive trees in the sunshine and we were given complimentary glasses of wine. It was such a fun day and we highly recommend this cookery school to anyone who wants a great day out alongside learning how to cook some delicious authentic Moroccan food. We were given our recipes to take away (which is SO useful) and the cookery school has various spices and things to buy as little presents so we bought their amazing olive oil. We would definitely go back! My advice would be eat a good breakfast as the enticing smells whilst you cook make you extra hungry and if you're travelling during winter take an extra jumper just in case. Thank you Faim d'Epices for such a great end to our Moroccan adventure."

I had purchased the full-day cooking class, including the spa add-on, for my wife as a Xmas gift and she absolutely loved it. We were picked up on time at the meeting spot in Jemaa el Fna square (don't fret if they're a few minutes late) and they drove us out to the farm. We were welcomed with a smile, some tea/coffee, and a very nicely designed \"farmhouse\" setting. The cooking class went all day which sounds long but it flies by and you're never bored. I won't go into details on the cooking as each day there is a different recipe (we did Friday's couscous with meat/veggies, an excellent classic dish), but during the session you learn plenty about the techniques and the spices. Best of all, it's completely interactive; there's only a few times where you're watching them cook, otherwise you're involved with the recipe the whole time. After you're finished cooking, you eat your meal outside in the sunshine - it's complete bliss and the food you make is delicious. What impressed me the most is that Michel followed-up with a thank you email and included a recipe from a dish that I told him I liked. It just shows how much he cares and listens to his customers and that is something that can be hard to come by nowadays.The spa add-on is very nice as well, even if you feel a bit full from eating all your food!I think you will be very impressed with Michel and his team and the cooking class too and I highly recommend it - bon appetit!"

My advice? Don't take the course if you expect a five star restaurant dining experience because you will be disappointed. But if you're after the real McCoy of Moroccan home cooking in a friendly atmosphere, this is the deal.The package includes a super cool host who takes time to chat with every participant and make them welcome at his school. Hey, he even gives out free tips (in Marrakesh, a very rare feat indeed), including advice on how to tell genuine saffron from shredded animal tendons and how not to get swindled when buying argan oil."

The owner Michel, is an eccentric french man with a great sense of humour. The lady leading the session (extremely nice and helpful) begins with a demonstration, and then you head to your workstations and she leads you through the steps once again, circling around to make sure you end up with delicious tasting food in the end, regardless of your shortcomings as a cook. Refreshments were served throughout the day (freshly squeezed orange juice was my personal favourite) and Michel does a very good job of explaining the traditional ingredients and spices and how they are used in moroccan cuisine. We were a group of about 12 people, but you get sufficient personal instruction. I have taken cooking courses before where you are 3-4 people huddled around 1 workstation and you split the tasks and therefore don't really get the full experience. Here you, you make your own dish entirely so there's a real sense of personal accomplishment at the end! To top it off, MIchel gives you a copy of the recipes for everything you've made that day. My mother and I were both really happy to have taken the class and highly recommend it, its a good relaxing change of pace from the hectic atmosphere of the souks. Lastly, the driver picks you up from your hotel (on time!) and was very pleasant. The fact that the place is a bit out in the country is also nice. ---Excellente exp\u00e9rience. Je recommande fortement cet atelier. Le personnel est chaleureux, les mets qu'ils enseignent sont d\u00e9licieux et on nous donnes les recettes a la fin de l'atelier. Ils expliquent des ingr\u00e9dients et comment ils sont utilis\u00e9s dans la cuisine marocaine. L\u2019ambiance est tr\u00e8s relax, ont est bien \u00e0 la campagne, un bon contraste avec le tumulte des soukhs. Le propri\u00e9taire Michel est tr\u00e8s accueillant et les dammes qui dirigent l'atelier sont patientes et gentilles. A ne pas manquer!"

Me and my boyfriend took part on this cooking course one Friday in December and totally found it the highlight of our trip (we also took part on another cooking school's course, but this one was better).Forget those few negative ratings said here on Tripadvisor, because at least I did find them true at all. You don't have to buy anything from the shop (or actually you might want to when you see the argan oil is much cheaper there than in most of stores you see it), THE FOOD you make and eat in Faim d'Epices is so good, the chef Michel is a really nice, easy to get along person, the Moroccon excellent chef named Mouna (? forgive me if I wrote your name wrong) is really good at teaching and the whole day was for us something we will look back with really nice memories for a long time."

We found out about the course on the Lonely Planet guide and the review was very accurate. Pick up, spice tests, cooking lessons, drumming ... everything was perfect. A family group joined on our day and the team were brilliant with the children. We also discovered you can get the cooking course and spa package and were able to book the spa at late notice. This was an incredible experience of steaming, exfoliation and massage followed by mint tea and pastries. Perfect way to round off a great day with Michel. Would recommend Faim d'Espices to anyone looking for a cooking experience in Marrakech."

This was undoubtedly the highlight of our holiday- cant recommend it enough! it is situated in a purpose built just just outside the city so apart from anything else, its nice to escape the hustle and bustle for a while. Lovely surroundings, a lovely, comfortable space, a genial host in Michel and lovely food! It is more than 'just' a cooking course, it is a whole experience( including djembe rhythm from Michel during the bread making!) and we learned more about Marrakech and Moroccan food than we did anywhere else. Everything works very smoothly and there is no pressure to 'work faster' or anything like that! Its almost like being on Masterchef with your own personal work station and everything all laid out for you. We ate the results of our labours in a lovely lunch outside in the sun with the other 4 course participants.I know that many of the riads also offer 'cookery classes' but doubt if they can offer anything on a par with this professional, friendly, inspirational and relaxed operation. This is an absolute must for anyone wanting to find out about genuine Moroccan food and culture."

My 3 children (15, 13 and 10 years old) and I signed up for the course in October as we were in Marrakech on holiday but my husband had to work for the day and we weren't sure about going round the city on our own. Michel made everything easy for us from the moment we emailed him with our enquiry - he reassured me that the children were welcome and answered all our questions very promptly. He came to pick us up from our riad - in the end my husband decided to come and work on his laptop at the cooking school and Michel could not have made him more welcome, keeping him supplied with snacks and drinks and even sharing his lunch with him! We loved meeting all our fellow students and making new friends and the children really enjoyed the whole experience, especially the blind spice tasting and Michel's drumming. Our youngest was given a special chef's hat to wear and a small drum to play along with Michel. We were all amazed that we could cook such delicious food, mostly due to head chef, Nezha's expert tuition! The lamb and prune tagine melted in our mouths and the homemade breads and salads complemented it perfectly... a great family bonding experience as we compared our pancakes, breads and tagines and debated whose was the best. Everything was spotlessly clean and inspired confidence and we cannot praise the whole experience highly enough. Michel, you take customer service to another level! Thanks for a fantastic day. We combined the cooking course with a spa visit where we and the children were made equally welcome - great value and a real life experience for us all."

He does a session on spices which teaches you about the various ones used and important information about purchasing and storing them. We then had cooking demonstrations and then made our own bread and tangines of lamb, artichoke and peas. The setting (about 30 minutes out from the Medina) was very pretty and filled with olive and lemon trees. After the cooking, we all enjoying dining outside in the sunshine with our delicious food.Highly recommend this cooking event."

We were given a very interesting spice workshop and were taught how to make bread, salads, Morroccan crepes and a lamb and prune tagine. There was a reasonably priced shop there and everything in the building was beautiful and tastfully done. The best surprise was being offered a glass of wine, something we found difficult to get in Marrakech. We were given some amazing ice cream for desert.

We also got to make a bread roll to go with said tagine.The rest of the day we watched the chef kneading dough for bread/pancakes and chopping veg to make salads for us to cook.There was an interesting lesson on spices, but I felt it took up too much of the day. It was nice sitting out eating our food at the end, but I'd rather have been eating more of what we had made...A pleasant day, but not a proper cooking course, and much less hands on cooking time compared to others I've experienced.And beware, the journey there can take a long time depending on how many other people are getting picked up."

I think this is activity is as fun as you make it.. it really is a recipe for a great day out.. they taught us about spices with blind smell tests.. showed us the differences between real saffron and the not so real stuff. we then made our own breads, pancakes.. and of course our tagines, at the end we all sat down as a group and ate. I don't want to spoil the fun too much so i won't tell you anymore.. but this is an absolute must if your in marrakech, its a great day out, its a great way to meet people, and its bloody good value for money!! Michel and all his staff we met were second to none, he runs a very tight ship, everything was clean neat and tidy. I will be returning back to do this again on my Next trip to Marrakech.

Michel emailed back promptly and confirmed pick up details near to our Riad for 9.30 the next morning. It was also a taxi drive where you didn't feel you were going to die before you got there!At first, my partner did not intend to cook, and Michel said it would be fine for him to pay a small amount to eat with us, however when we arrived there were children and families cooking, that he decided to partake in the activities and he was pleased he did. The building was spotlessly clean, and was very well organised with preparation happening seamlessly. This is a cooking workshop that is fun and relaxed and for all abilities with Chef Nezha. I was surprised just how much the \"non foodie\" partners and children enjoyed it. The food we cooked, and subsequently ate as a group was devine, probably the tastiest we ate whilst in Marrakech!

Each day a different dish is made so check to see what they are making on the day of the week you choose to go.

So I, very hesitantly, signed us both up for the Michel's cooking school in Marrakech. It was well worth it. It was fun and I was not bored. My wife considers it the highlight of her trip to Morocco. The staff were very helpful, picking us up at our riad and returning us there. It was great to get out of the city for a day. I highly recommend it, even for those who aren't interested in cooking but especially for those who are."

Nothing was too much trouble and from collection to drop off it was very professional.

We had one of our best days in Marrakesh here, it was so calm and relaxing and we had a great time cooking, laughing with the others in the group and cooking, obviously! They were very accommodating (although a little perplexed!) by the fact I was a vegetarian and even prepared some special vegetarian recipes for me to take home The day began by Michel picking us up, laughing at Moroccan road safety skills and enjoying (relatively) calm drive about 20 mins out of the centre where we were staying. The setting of this cookery course was our on the outskirts of the centre and was a purpose built building in lots of (olive?) orchards. The course lasted almost all day, with lots of activities such as spice tasting and bread and salad making, in addition to the main meal we were preparing. After all was prepared, we had a lovely group meal outside in the sunshine. Food was plentiful and it was possibly the only place we purchased something in Marrakesh without being hassled and over charged - in fact we brought most of our gifts for those back home here."

Thanks a lot for this!Even before getting there I was impressed by the service: not only did they answer very quickly to all my e-mails, but Michel also asked me if I preferred a vegetarian version, if I had any allergies, etc. I found this very professional.Transport from (and back to) your accomodation to the farm where the course takes place is included in the price. I booked the combined offer with Mythic Oriental Spa, so I was brought there upon completion of the course.We had a very interesting workshop on Moroccan spices, where we had to smell the spices without seeing them and had to guess what spices they were. We had several cooking demonstrations and also prepared several dishes and everything was so delicious. I fell so much in love with the tajine that I even decided to buy a small tajine in the shop.I would love to visit again and try more dishes :)"

To start we had a quiz to get our spicey senses tingling. Fake ray bans in abundance, with lenses blacked out, we began learning all the different spices by smell. From that we moved on to making bread (the morrocan way), simmering a sumptuous beef tagine and folding sweet pancakes into squares for dessert. We were shown how to rustle up salads and present them to our future guests.We enjoyed our meal with Michel the founder of the cookery centre, washing down the tagine with a cup of red wine on the house. Delicious. All in all, it was a great day out and I feel confident that I could reproduce this style of cusine at home for friends and family to all enjoy my new found culinary skills!"

All thanks to Michel and Nezha, we can now make some seriously tasty food now that we are back home.Michel was an excellent host, who put the whole group at ease straight away and continued to entertain us throughout the day. The whole thing was well planned, so after Nezha had got us started on making batbout stove top bread, Michel then gave us a blindfolded spice lesson whilst the dough was proving. He taught us all about the spice combinations that are used in Moroccan food, but also passed on some practical tips like how to identify real saffron and Argan oil, rather than the stuff usually found in the souks. Nezha then expertly got on with the serious business of teaching us how to cook in the tagine. By lunchtime we had successfully made a very tasty lamb dish with prunes and almonds and my husband had cooked a layered vegetarian tagine. She had also demonstrated how to make 3 salads including a sweet one made with cucumber and orange flower water. We also tried our hand at preparing moroccan flaky layered pancakes called Msemen, which were later served to us with home made gingerbread ice cream. Everything we tried was delicious, and I feel confident I can attempt to recreate the dishes now I'm home, as the explanations were all very clear and straightforward. We were given a recipe to take home, but I've also since been emailed more to try, and some photos of the day too. So, if you are considering doing this and think it sounds pricey, I can tell you that it was money well spent, and in my opinion good value for money. The price includes transport to and from the farm on the outskirts of Marrakesh, large quantities of food, and lots of little extras too."

Upon our arrival in the majestic city of Marrakech, me and my girlfriend agreed on a trade-off - one day we go with her request to visit an authentic and luxurious Moroccan spa for a hammam and massage treatment (we did, at the breathtaking Palais Rhoul), but on another we embark on trying our hands at another of Morocco's great traditions - its cooking.As a guy who is into his home cooking, this looked an ideal opportunity to hone in on my skills with Moroccan cuisine. To be honest, making a Moroccan meal is one of my weak links as the kitchen goes - I have not attempted any Moroccan dishes for about three years, when I prepared a dinner that tasted more like Stollen. But with lamb in it.Despite being rather apprehensive over this excursion out of the hubbub and into a farm in the middle of nowhere, my girlfriend really started to enjoy herself very quickly. Everyone else in our nine-strong group of aspiring Jamies and Nigellas were all very friendly, with everyone embracing what was an out-of-the-box activity for each of us.The course is hosted by an eccentric and dry-witted Parisian called Michel, who in his expressions or mannerism, could have passed as a Jose Mourinho impersonator (well, in his own words, \"for a small fee\"). He made all the cooks feel at ease with the preparation process. One of the highlights of the day was Michel's blind ingredient test, where the entire party donned darkened \"Ray-Ben\" shades and tried to identify key spices, herbs and fruits symbolic with Moroccan cuisine.The cooking itself was carefully taught by a Moroccan chef called Nisa, who demonstarted how to prepare regional crepes, salad and bread (the latter of which we all then tried our hands at ourselves), as well as the star attraction - a Lamb & Prune Tagine. After all our individual tagines and breads had been cooked by each member of the group, we all basked in the sun in the giant garden outside and enjoyed our creations with a well-earned glass of wine. Michel then presented us with everyone with a couple of fantastic farewell surprises.An amazing experience - great fun was had by everyone, and best of all, I feel I can now confidently cook a Moroccan lamb without making it taste like Christmas cake."

The anecdotal way Michel presented the spice lesson was both informative and engaging. Ending the afternoon with an al fresco luncheon comprised of the dishes we'd made ourselves was a perfect cap. I'm looking forward to recreating the chicken tagine for my friends\u2026 once my preserved lemons are ready!"

The day is well organised with free collection and return from my hotel. I booked the hotel in conjunction with the Mythic Oriental Spa hammam deal and found this to be excellent value. The hammam after the cooking school was exquisite and truly refreshing and relaxing after a hard days cooking!! I was escorted directly to the spa from the cooking location and the whole day was a breeze. Even though I chose to do it as a lone woman I felt safe and cared for and had an absolute blast learning to cook tradition tagine, bread, salad and crepes. The recipes and spices that I were given to bring home were a wonderful gift that I will treasure and use for many years to come. I would recommend this day trip to every single person who goes to Marrakech, you will not be disappointed."

We were picked up from our Riad at 09.30 and dropped back at 18.00. A full day has never passed so quickly. As well as a blind sniffing experience we learnt and made bread, fish tangine and crepes and also watched 3 salads being prepared. We then sat down for a leisurely meal, Al Fresco on a shady patio overlooking olive and lemon trees. I'm still smiling. Would recommend highly and would be fun for kids older than 12 too."

The technical level is relatively basic and the cooking part proceeds gently; on the other hand it is a very good introduction to an unfamiliar cuisine and manages to cater to those who cant peel a spud properly without patronizing anyone, by means of emphasizing what is particular to Moroccan cooking. Recommended for most levels of cook. Don't be afraid if youve hardly ever cooked anything before and you won't be bored if you are a family & friends dinner party type cook looking to expand your horizons."

We decided not to take a full week cooking course as we had before as also wanted to explore Morocco as well. I was very happy to find Faim d'Epices. We had a great day and enjoyed everything from the time we were picked up.The blind spice smelling challenge was very interesting and a great way to start the day. The chef who explained how to make the food was very clear and very helpful. We each made our own tagine and all were delicious. They were very helpful and helped me make a vegetarian tagine as everyone else made one with lamb. Everything was very tastey and the whole experience fun.We also went to the hammam they have a partnership with - after the cooking class. We also had a great experience there. It was a perfect day!"

I cannot recommend this day highly enough.We were picked up by a Faim d'Espices member of staff in a clearly marked van (which was wonderfully air-conditioned), and transported to the farm,which is just outside of Marrakech. What struck me first was the open plan building, which has been modified for purpose. It is an absolutely gorgeous space, very bright and airy. They grow all their own produce there, including veg and spices. We were greeted by Michel, the owner, and given mint tea and coffee. Michel then took us through a spice demonstration, where you do a blind smelling quiz. My partner was so much better than me, but it was very interesting, and charming.We were taught how to make 3 different Moroccan salads, square pancakes, bread and a fish tagine. We ate them all, after an incredibly relaxing day- delicious.The lovely Nezha is great teacher, who is very patient, and obviously very skilled (she said that she learnt first from Mum, then studied). I was extremely impressed with her. Michel made the day for us, which was casual and fun. He left Paris after realising one day that he wasn't happy. I admire his courage, and from a purely selfish perspective, am very pleased that he did. What a great day.If you are considering having a cookery lesson in Marrakech, please pick this one. It is organic, clean, welcoming and above all else tasty! Thank you."

Michel picked us up right from the Riad in the Medina and drove us to Faim d'Epices. From beginning to end, the cooking lesson was a lot of fun and very informative. We enjoyed the spice lesson, cooking tips, meeting other travel and tagine enthusiasts, and of course, the food. The lamb tagine we made in the class ranked among the best tagines we tried in Marrakesh (and we tried quite a few). Michel was a great and humorous host.

The format of the day was well structured and included a selection a items to do, view and comment on. The 'blind' spice smell test was good fun as was sitting with the group eating our efforts at the end of the session.

We did our class in English, although I assume we could have done it in French as well.We were picked up near our riad in the medina - there was no confusion as our driver was wearing a Faim d'Epices shirt and the van was clearly marked with their logo.The class is held in a nice, sunny room with huge windows, and went at a relaxed, comfortable pace.We started with a mini-seminar on the spices used in Moroccan cuisine, including how they should smell and how to shop for them. I wish we had had this instruction earlier in our visit, because afterwards I felt a lot more empowered to visit the spice souks and buy the spices we used during the day.We then learned how to cook breads, salads, and of course a delicious tajine. Fresh orange juice and mint tea was served to us throughout. The environment was fun and relaxed, and I felt the team at Faim d'Epices did a good job of delivering the course at a level each person could grasp. An absolute beginner would have a blast at this class, but I also think that the team is so knowledgable, they could definitely discuss the finer points of Moroccan cooking with even the most experienced of chefs.The recipe and ingredients were top notch, and the end result was the best tajine of our visit. When the cooking was done, we enjoyed the fruits of our efforts outside on the patio with a glass of wine. The cost of the class would have been worth it for the meal alone.A great experience. I would recommend anyone visiting Marrakech book with Faim d'Epices. We booked the combination package with the Mythic Oriental Spa, which I also highly recommend doing.

The best experience of the two weeks though was our cookery class at Faim d'Epices. Michel made us feel so relaxed and welcome from the very first moment and ensured the experience was just a lot of fun.There was only one other couple with us (who were lovely) and the whole experience lasted about 6 hours, which was exceptional value for money. We made, breads, pastries and a stunning beef and artichoke tagine (which biastly was the best tasting one I had on our trip).Sitting in the garden afterwards with a glass of wine and eating all of our food we made was fabulous and I could have happily gone back again for another class on the same trip.If you go to Marrakech, you must try this experience!!!! and please do not worry if you can't cook as everything is explained so well and there is always help from Nesha or Michel as you go along. Final thing, don't worry if you burn the bread like me as Michel will help you eat it ; )"

Certainly not us but with fantastic guidance from Michel and Nesha we produced a delicious chicken tagine that we will be rolling out now we are back home. This was a most brilliant day from start to finish - Michel really is a star and had us laughing through the day, not to mention teaching us how to identify the different spices. And Nezha - what a cook! Great location away from the hustle and bustle from the city and its a really professional set up - well done Faim d'epices. If you do one thing in Marrakech do this and the Mythic Oriental spa combi day - we loved Marrakech as a result. Thank you to all the Faim d'epices team for making it such an experience."

The whole thing was incredibly well organised, and we couldn't have asked for a better day out. Our host, Michel (one of the owners), was very charming and funny, and you could tell he had a real passion for what he did. The class was so well organised that you never really felt that you were waiting around for anything, nor did you feel rushed or stressed at any point. Our cooking instructor was very lovely and patient and explained things so well, that even a novice like myself came up with something worth of a Michelin star (if i do say so myself). They bring in only a small group (there were 8 of us including myself and my girlfriend), and they created such a friendly relaxed atmosphere that by the time we got down to eating our meals, we were all chatting and laughing like the best of friends. It's an experience I would highly recommend. To top it all off, we were given the recipes for our meals, and sent very nice pictures and a \"certificate\" endorsing our new found skills :-) A truly wonderful experience."

In spite of having a good Moroccan friend tagging along to show us the best places in Marrakech, it didn't deter us to check out how to make the most of our visit. After revising many options, we decided that cooking lessons would be a fantastic way to start our journey...and indeed it was great.I contacted Faim d' Epices via email and Michel swiftly responded to all my queries and arranged our cooking class. If you have any dietary restriction, they will kindly accomodate it so no stress in that matter.As planned, they were picking us up timely at the Hotel to be transported to the training location, a confortable facility surrounded by orange and olive trees. There, we were welcomed by Michel with mint tea and we met the rest of the apprentices.After explaining the activities for the day, we were invited to check out how Nezha, the chef, prepared bread in the traditional way. Later we engaged a worksop on spices. This was a super interesting activity and we had so much fun trying to identify (blinded of course) the wide range of aromas presented.After the workshop we went to our neatly arranged cooking stations, prepared with the tagines, chopping board, knife and other relevant cooking utensils, as well as with the mise en place of all ingredients.Nezha patiently explained the steps to prepare our tagine and encouraged us to reproduce her bread making techniques...Oh boy, this was hilarious for all my friends since i was the only one who does not have any clue on how to cook something else but boiling water for tea.... In spite of all odds, I managed very well! Nezha gave clear instructions on how to chop vegetables, how much spices needed to be added and how to turn the meat for the Lamb Tagine with prunes. We also were taught how to prepare 3 different salads and the popular folded pastry while sipping fresh squeezed orange juice.After we completed our cooking task, we sat outside in the garden to enjoy our fresh made food accompanied with a glass of wine while sharing our experiences of Marocco and its charms.We indeed had a lovely experience and a fun time learning the tricks of cooking a nice traditional meal. We were really pampered and well taken care of. Our words of gratitude to Michel for his wittiness and hosting abilities and to Nezha for her caring dedication to teach us patiently those tricks. Ah! before I forget, at the end they also provide you with the recipes and some spices to put your new learned skills in practice!"

Michel, one of the owners of the cooking school, picked us up at our hotel and drove us to the farm- a lovely place surronded by fruit and olive trees. The kitchen stations are quite big and can fit 10 very comfortably- you don't have to worry about sharing a small space or bumping elbows with your cooking partner. The day we went we were cooking beef with candied oranges and pears which ended up being phenomenal. Both the main chef and the owner are constantly helping and assisting so even those with very little cooking skill will be hard pressed to screw up. There are step by step instructions for everything that you make- the bread, main dish, three salads, and dessert so one never feels lost or confused. After you have finished with your meal a small glass of wine is served and everyone takes to the patio to eat the meals prepared and to soak in the fact that coming into the course we knew very little of Moroccan cuisine and leaving we felt like we could easily make the recipes again and again. Upon leaving we were given a small bag of the main spice used in all of the cuisine, as well as the recipes we had made for that day. It was a wonderful experience and one I will not soon forgot. There are many other cooking courses in Marrkech but for a genuinely different and lovely experience I can recommend this one emphatically!!! Should we return to Morocco we will no doubt visit this place again!"

As part of a gastro trip to Marrakech we knew we wanted to do a cookery course to learn all about the local cuisine and through searching on trip advisor we took the plunge and booked a day at Faim d'Epices and I can genuinely say that that we cannot wait to go back! We were picked up bang on time from an agreed location near our Riad and joined a mini bus full of people just as excited as we were about what the day was going to bring. We knew we were going to have a great day the moment we met Michel, who was extremely funny and very entertaining. After chatting to all the other people over a very civilised mint tea we took part in a spice test which was so interesting and gave us an insight into all the various spices so we knew what to look out for in the souks and what to avoid! Following this the day was spent making breads, chicken and olive tagine, various salads and pancakes. The entire team's passion, dedication, patience and expert guidance was so appreciated and included the right balance of tuition, guidance and practical and then to sit in the sun eating all our carefully crafted food with some good wine and good company rounded off the day. Once we had all enjoyed our delicious food we were safely deposited back to our Riad. There were so many lovely touches throughout the day and we were sent away with the recipes from the day and Michel even followed up the day by sending us photos from our day and even more recipes. We are already planning our next visit!"

So I'll direct my comments to non-cooking men, a group that includes me. Okay, so your wife wants you to go to cooking class with her and you'd rather be poked in hte eye with a sharp stick. You didn't go all the way to Marrakech to learn to cook. Well, just get over it. This class is fun even if you know nothing about cooking and don't really think you want to. It starts with a blind sniff test of various spices. Out of about twenty samples, I think I got about two right. Heck, I probably wouldn't have gotten more than a half dozen if I'd been able to look at them. But it was fun watching the other people figure them out. One young kid about 12 years old beat me by a mile. Then the cooking starts. You first get a demonstration, then you're led step by step through each process. It's pretty hard to screw it up, really. My bread might not have been as pretty as some others, but it tasted just as good. That and the desserts were my favorite part, since the main dish wasn't really something I'd have picked. But everyone else thought it tasted great. And even I felt a sense of accomplishing something new.So get over those silly hangups and do something your wife wants to do for a change. She'll appreciate it, and you might even like it."

This was great fun, blindly smelling various spices and trying to guess their identities followed by a tutorial of their culinary uses. The school itself was a lovely space, very aesthetic and welcoming. The cooking stations were well equiped and our instructor Nehza was very hands on, frequently checking on us to ensure we were \"boxing\" and \"stretching\" our dough correctly. We tasted a few things as we went along (although be sure to eat a big breakfast as you won't eat anything substantial until the afternoon) and at the end of the day we enjoyed the full bounty of our day's work with a sit down lunch on the terrace overlooking the garden. The dishes we learned to make were tasty and ones I feel I could definitely duplicate at home. A nice introduction to Moroccan cuisine in a laid back yet professional environment.

So, a review for the cooking class in Marrakech, sorry this took so long. \u00a0Problem is I can't remember names at this point, however, the important part, the cooking, well that will be no problem...We had a blast. \u00a0The fella who probably co owns the class, Michel, picked us up at the designated time there at our Riad, so it starts with convenience.We Headed off to get another couple, two sisters from Ireland, it ended up being just the four of us, two buddies on a Blueman bonding trip, and these two ladies, so the space was beyond ample, I'd suggest they could accommodate ten comfortably, and do most of the time, so make your reservations early,The cool thing about this class was that it was taught using good English. \u00a0They do German and French, probably Spanish, maybe even Hindi, but not having to work thru an interpreter is helpful.The space is outside of town, so it's relatively quiet, actually quite quiet. \u00a0Also very hygienic with clean toilets, soap, towels, etc.The teaching is on par with soup to nuts. \u00a0We actually made couscous, from scratch, possible the only time I'll do that !? Not that it was hard, but there are good ready mixes out there, but we all liked having that experience under our belts.We also made breads, and doughs for dessert creeps, those too we're fun, and very tasty !To include with the couscous, actually adding to its flavor as it/they cooked from below, was a medley of veggies, and off to the side, caramelized onions, which really came across more like a controlled substance, adding a wonderful flavor, as well as bouquet, to the finished \u00a0meal.Prior to eating we put several cold salads together, one a shredded cucumber with a dressing from orange juice, the other, yikes, this is where it would have paid off to do this review sooner, my 1970's influenced mind can't recollect the specifics of it. \u00a0Sorry.Another cool thing about this class was when you would be in between courses, \u00a0where there really isn't anything to do other than watch veggies cook, Michel would form a group off to the side, on comfy couches where you would be educated on the nuances of their various spices and herbs, quite a smart thing to do, since other classes I've taken in Morocco simply let you wander off on a smoke break.Lastly, as cool things these guys did that others don't, after we sat outside on their patio and finished off the results of our dicing, slicing, and steaming, they brought us outa very handsome ice cream and strawberry dessert, accompanied by those crepes that we had a part of kneading earlier. \u00a0Very un expected, and wonderfully received; nice job !!!At this time of the season they were running a special, tied to a very chic spa there in Marrakech. \u00a0So with a full belly we left the class around three, maybe as late a four, and Maurice (Aka) took us to the spa, where he sat and talked with us until the massage folks were ready for us, another nice customer services touch.The spa was wonderful, sure, do I wish I looked better in the tong made of crepe paper, of course, but, with all due respect, I doubt Brad Pitt would even look good in them, and it's not like anyone sees you ??? \u00a0It should be noted that this wasn't some quickie nooner spa experience, we got a full body scrub using the essence of your choice, black mud, rose oil, choices like those. \u00a0Then after a nice sit in sort of a steam/sauna you'd get washed off, then a full hour massage, followed with herbal teas and relax time, this spa is quite nice, it appeared to be run by a French couple with the help of parents. \u00a0Very chic, nicely renovated old Riad there in Marrakech.That's it, I do think you should do these, Marrakech has grown up, it isn't the cool place it once was, after all, just too many people can afford cheap scooters now, and with no restrictions as to where they can ride them you're at risk just wandering. \u00a0The rug merchants ask way too much for their pieces, and if you don't know those products you're not going to get anything rally worth taking home, but I suppose that is in the eye of the beholder...sorry. Point, take advantage of a fun day, especially if you want to see Marrakech, you won't be sorry.Haj, aka, Salida1048"

On arrival we were warmly greeted and offered mint tea or coffee whilst waiting for the rest of the group, 11 in total. The room was all on one level, comfortable and light with our cook stations all set up waiting. As everyone arrived we all got chatting easily and Michel was great, making us all instantly relaxed.We went on to learn about spices and tips as to what to look out for in the Medina, as you can imagine there are a few things that are not completely genuine for example, saffron and Argon oil's.We were shown how to make bread, chicken tajine with red olives, salads and Moroccan version of pancakes. After a very full and extremely interesting day of cooking all these lovely things, Michel and his team then offered us some lovely wine, soft drinks and we as a group we enjoyed our labours in a lovely tranquil outside area, which has orange, lemon and olive trees. All in all this is a great trip to do whilst you are away. They speak great English and so made it easier for us to understand.  I then received an e mail from Michel yesterday. He has very kindly sent photo's of us and some more lovely recipes for us to enjoy now we are back in the UK, what a great touch, this is how to look after your clients.

From the pick up early on Saturday, to the lovely conversation, long lunch, hands on experience and warm sun... it was a true gem! We bought it as a package deal with a local hammam, thus the day was heavenly. I can't wait to come back and take another class with Michel. Michel, Je t'aime!"

Heres why:-Knowledgeable team with good english. This is often the biggest fault in internations coking classes. Even better, they're really fun people. -The spice tasting/review really is informative to better understand what and how to use each ingredient. You learn instead of just carrying out a recipe.-You leave FULL. This was an absolutely delicious, big meal. -Unlike a lot of other cooking classes, you get to make the each dish, instead of breaking into groups.-The recipes the send with you match the class, no hidden ingredients and tricks you'll forget later. We absolutely recommend L'atelier Faim d'Epices, it was our favorite activity in Marrakech. Go!"

We where a group of 7 and it is an excellent activity for a group of this size. There wasn't one part of the day we didn't like. We where picked up by Michel, spot on time and it was very interesting to to see outside of the city. The food was delicious (even if I do say so myself), I have tried a few of the recipes since returning home and they are as tasty now as they where on the day. I would thoroughly recommend L'atelier Faim d'Epices to anyone who is travelling to Marrakesh. My own personal regret is not taking advantage of the deal they have with the spa."

Upon our arrival we were served mint tea and coffee while the staff finished up preparations. Michel introduced us to the spices we would be using that day. Each pair of students has their own cooking station with all the necessary ingredients and cooking equipment. I used to work in the food business so I was particularly impressed with the level of organization and the thought put into the flow of the class.We learned how to prepare several dishes from a lovely, Moroccan woman. The directions were clear and easy to follow. After cooking, we all sat outside in the sun to enjoy the delicious fruits of our labor with a glass of wine. After buying some supplies and receiving our printed recipes, we were driven back to our riad.A few weeks later, I received an email with additional recipes AND photos of my husband and I that were taken throughout the day by Michel. There were six couple in our class and there are classes every day of the week. I have no idea how Michel managed to sort and send the photos to all the students. Amazing! Thank you for the photos Michel!"

Next you learn how to make bread and swiftly move on to prepare for the tagine (in our case, a beef tagine), which will incorporate many of the spices that you were exposed to during the blind test.For dessert you learn how to make a typical Moroccan type of pancake (which will later on will later on be complemented by some nice locally-made ice creams).Once everything is cooked you'll get to taste it all and more, as the staff will have prepared some additional salads in the meantime.Good points:- they pick you up and drop you off- extremely well priced (550 Dhiram for a full day)- friendly and charismatic host- the whole area is nice and clean (as are the toilets)- 'Cous Cous' the cat!Room for improvement:- it was quite cold when we were there (rainy day in Marrakesh)Ounces of fun...just go!"

For photos, see my blog: http://www.eatdreamtravel.com/2012/03/couscous-cumin-and-cooking-class.htmlAfter all the great eating we were doing in Marrakech, we wanted to learn how to make some of the dishes, so we signed up for a cooking class at Faim d'Epices. I was hesitant at first to spend the money (about 55 euros per person), but I'm very glad we did. Michel, a jolly Frenchman and one of the owners of the enterprise, picks you up and takes you to a building outside the city in a grove of olive trees. Then you watch Nehza, a sweet Moroccan chef, demonstrate how to make the circular bread you see everywhere here. Then Michel leads you through a spice class, blindfolding you and seeing who can figure out what spice is which by smell alone. After that, it's off to your own cooking station to make the bread, and then to make the tajine of the day, which in our case was the Berber tajine, featuring vegetables and some beef. Nehza is there every step of the way to help, but you also get to be hands-on, which is great. While the tajines cook, she demonstrates the making of various salads as well as Moroccan crepes. At this point, you are starving and then finally it is time for the meal. You sit outside with your new friends under the olive trees, eating the delicious fruits of your labor. Michel offers you wine, and then just when you can't eat another bite, out comes ice-cream. This is the perfect way to get out of the city, meet people, and learn how to cook Moroccan food! (They also have a package where you combine the cooking class with a half day at a spa/hammam, and it is a good deal, so I wish we had done that, instead of the hammam that we went to...which is a story for another post.)"

The whole day from start to finish was fabulous, and the course was much more than just cooking, as Michel teaches you about all the herbs and spices which was very useful for all cooking, not just moroccan! We also watched how to make 3 different moroccan salads, and pancakes, and got to make our own bread which is something ive always wanted to do.Everything was perfectly organised and easy to follow, and after we cooked our tagines we all took them outside to eat on the terrace, followed by the best homemade icecream i've ever had!Before we got taken back to the city Michel gave us the recipes we had used presented beautifully in a glass tube, and some of his own blend of Ras Al Hanout, the spice used for tagines.When i got home from marrakech i had an email from Michel with all the pictures he had taken of myself and my family on the day we were there, you wouldnt get this anywhere else!This day was the highlight of my trip and is excellent value for money, myself and my family would definitely go back again and were gutted we did it on our last day and couldnt go again!"

Michel is like a charming French schoolboy with a bit of naughtiness in his ways...he told us (with great humor and charm) how to spot fake saffron, how to discern the scents of paprika and ways of telling different kinds of cinnamon from one another. We then learned how to make salads and tagine, and everything cooked up quite well, even though many of us weren't particularly gifted cooks.

We were picked up bang on time at the selected pick up in the easy to spot people carrier and were whisked off to the Marrakech countryside. Mint tea on arrival and then a bread making demonstration. The blind spice session was interesting and very informative especially if you want to buy some spices back in the souks. Then it was time to make the bread, guided step by step to make the perfect Moroccan bread. Bread made, onto the tagine. Again we were guided so no one fell behind and before you knew it your tagine was bubbling away, aromas galore. Whilst our tagines cooked we were given demonstrations on Moroccan salads and then crepes. Food ready we sat outside and enjoyed our creations with a glass of wine. Then it was time to return to the hustle and bustle of the Medina."

I think I have cooked if I put a ready meal in the oven rather than the microwave so when my friends suggested we go on a cooking course I was a little worried .... then I realised it was exactly what I needed !!My friend booked it all via the website and we paid cash , in dirhams , at the end of the day. Pick up was fine , we were met outside Cafe Argana in the main square. Driver spotted us instantly and called out my friends name so we were reassured it was the right driver. ( The other members of our group arrived in a marked minibus so easy to spot. )It was about a 40 minutes drive to the farm which I really enjoyed. I have been to Marrakech several times and mainly stayed within the medina , so I found it interesting to drive through the outskirts , see the kids all going to school and witness a bit of everyday life away from the main tourist centre. We turned off down a bumpy track and we were soon pulling up outside the farm.First impression was WOW , this looks great ! A beautiful modern , air-conditioned building in a field with olive trees and other varieties. Immediately inside the door is a sofa area and small selection of things to buy. Lovely old Moroccan posters cover the walls and lots of purple accessories .... Michel's favourite colour we think ...We sat and had mint tea while we waited for the rest of the group who arrived 5 minutes later.Michel , the owner and creator who picked the other guests up is , as previously mentioned by other reviewers very twinkly ! He talked us through the day and I couldn't wait to get started !We made bread , a tagine , had a talk on spices with some interesting facts and tips on buying saffron and argan oil , watched a salad demonstration , helped make crepes then sat out in the sun and ate our tagines and bread followed by crepes with fruit and ice cream. Delicious !This cooking school does not claim to teach you how to cook gourmet meals , it is a light hearted introduction to simple Moroccan food and spices. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and I had a really good day. If you are looking for something a bit different to do or just want a break from the crazy bustle of Marrakech this is a good choice.I'm off to buy a tagine !"

All the recepies were demonstrated to us, and when it was our turn to have a go, we were all helped as much or as little as needed.Our introduction to the wide variety of spices was good fun, and was very informative.Michele's staff were very adept at clearing away the washing up, whilst we were shown another delicious recepie. And of course, at the end of the day we ate what we had cooked, washed down with a lovely glass of wine.We would recommend this day course to anyone, whatever your level of cooking ability, you will easily be able to show off to friends when you get hom.We will certainly be considering returning to do a different recepie day.Regards Tony & Sue Cook"

My boyfriend was a bit hesitant about the idea as he is not an experienced cook, but it was fine for all abilities, as they demonstrate every step and supervise you so you can't really do anything wrong. The building and surroundings were lovely, and their resident cat very friendly. We made Moroccan flatbread, tagines (I made a a vegetarian one, others did beef or chicken), msemen, and were shown how to make three different salads which later accompanied the meal, although we did not make these ourselves. We were able to sample the demonstrations along the way, and given real fresh orange juice from their trees, as well as delicious coffee and mint tea. The spice workshop was a great touch too, trying to blindly identify different herbs and spices by smell alone, and told a bit about each one.The atmosphere was welcoming and relaxed, and the final result was definitely worth the preparation. The tagines and pancakes went down very well in the sunshine, especially with a glass of wine. At the end we were given a copy of the recipes, and some spices to take home. We paid about \u00a342 each for this day, which was excellent value - you absolutely would not get anything like this for such a low price in the UK. I don't think they run through the hotter summer months, but if you get a chance to go then I highly recommend that you do so, whatever your cooking ability."

I saw this as a must do in Marrakech and saw all the positive reviews so decided to take advantage of the cookery class and hammam deal. Was worried it may have been overhyped but we were not disappointed. There was five of us and we had the whole day to ourselves. We thoroughly enjoyed the day, it was relaxing and fun and we had a laugh. We were taught to make the Berbers tagine, Moroccan bread and had a go making Moroccan pancakes. It was very satisfying to end the class enjoying our own cooked food. They prepare a different dish for each day of the week so if you are in Marrakech for several days you may want to enquire beforehand to see what dishes they will teach so you can pick a day when they will cook something you prefer.The chef and Michel were great and it added to the overall experience."

We booked this solely on the recomendation of fellow tripadvisers before we left for Marrakech. ( I strongly advise to book to avoid disapointment) We got the deal where we were then taken to the Oriental Spa for a Hamman and Massage - which I would also throuroughly recomend.But im here to talk about the cookery course. We had a fantastic time. Everything was taken care of for us - we were picked up from our hotel and whisked away to the country side ( 20mins outside Marrakech)The actual venue was purpose built and looked beautiful - surrounded by a farm and Lemon/Orange(?) trees.I wont spoil it for you - but the course had a few extra bits that made it even better than described. We all had our own work stations - so were all able to individualy do the cooking/chopping/ mixing - instead of having to share the tasks with a partner. And then when you had finsihed one part of the cooking - you are taken for another demonstration while the staff clear and clean your work stations. Perfect!The only recomendation I would make is to eat a big breakfast before you go - as the cooking takes a long time. We didnt end up eating until about 3. ( although we were able to sample some bits and pieces throughout the demos.The team ( especially Michel) are really friendly and made us feel relaxed and welcome."

Michel, (the host, owner and driver) is a very knowledgable, friendly guy, who has created a wonderful business for those wanting to learn more about cooking with spices.Worlds away from the centre of Marrakech (although only about 20 mins!), Michel has got his business spot on.He collects you and your fellow 'students' from your hotels and drives you to his place, a newly built workshop amongst his acres of olive growing land.With the aid and patience of his lovely English speaking cooks, the relaxed, fun but resourceful day is then spent learning about spices (their origins, purposes and usage etc), how to make bread, tagines, salads and pancakes.The afternoon is then spent relaxing outside, eating the tagine and bread you've just made with your new friends.The only downside to this trip was that I didn't want to go back to the Medina afterwards!This is a definite must-do if you come to Marrakech, and all at a very reasonable price too.Oh, and by the way, did I mention that (asides from your hands) there wasn't a spot of washing-up we had to do neither?!!

This worked out very well as we spent up to late afternoon at the 'farm' and then unwound in the evening back in Marrakech. Overall, it was a great way to end our week in Morocco.We were picked up reasonably early in the morning by Michel, our guide for the day. As the cooking course is well advertised, we were in a small but diverse group of people - this made the day all the more entertaining. After a short drive out of Marrakech, we arrived at the destination, a small bungalow on a plot with olive and various other trees. The building is very nicely done up, well laid out, very clean. We were shown round, given plenty of tea/coffee and then the briefed about the day.The cooking itself is very well organised. Though you cook the bread and main dish only, you get to help out with the desserts and salad. The personal kitchens and demonstration area are ideal, and the chef was extremely friendly giving pointers along the way. Prior to the cooking, you have a spices workshop, which was really interesting. Michel lets you in on some trade secrets, and you learn a lot about the ingredients that we tend to take for granted in our day to day diets. After the cooking is over, you get to enjoy the location and eat outside. We were even treated to some home-prepared ice-cream.Michel was a great guide, and the staff were great all round. You have the chance to buy local produce at the end, but there is no pressure to buy. This, I suppose, is reflected in the price. If you want a hassle-free fun experience you have to fork out that little bit extra. As a nice gesture, you get some spices and the recipes to take home with you!We did have a minor problem with the taste of the olives, but that shouldn't take away from what as a great day out."

It all begins with the warm welcome from Michel when he gets out of the minibus to greet you like you are his closest friend. Then it\u2019s a short drive out of the city to the Faim d\u2019Epices, with Michel keeping you entertained along the way with his friendly banter.When you arrive at the destination, it will look like any other place in Marrakech, dusty and brown. But (like a lot of places in the city) when you walk through the door you\u2019ll be charmed by the beautiful interior of the building. This is something we experienced a lot in Marrakech; rough and ready on the outside but the interiors are truly breath-taking.To begin, we are offered traditional mint tea or coffee and given a chance to relax before the cooking course begins. Michel even explained how the mint tea is made.The first thing we learned to make was a traditional Moroccan flat bread; made completely from scratch and cooked on the stove. First we watched the cook make it close up, then we made it ourselves with the guidance of Michel and the cook.While our dough was left to rise for 30 mins, we were given a spice class that explained the various spices used in Moroccan cooking. Some of these spices, herbs and flavours were well known and some not so well known (argan oil, rancid butter, orange blossom, preserved lemons). The spice class was fun and informative.Next, we each made our own fish tagine with lots of veg and herbs and spices. This was the most informative part of the class for me because you actually learnt how to use a tagine for cooking. Tips included chopping the veg the right thickness, layering the items in a particular order and piling the ingredients up high. The tagines were then left to cook for around 45 minutes while we moved on to the next stage.Next we watched 3 different Moroccan salads being made. These were simple to make and full of flavour. We also helped make a delicious Moroccan pastry which is a kind of sweet bread made with lots of thin layers. We tasted these with different types of toppings.Finally whilst our tagines were almost cooked, we finished making our own breads on the stove. Michel warned us that someone always burns their bread\u2026 and he was right (not me).The final stage is the feast. Eat your own tagine as well as helpings of the different salads and your own freshly cooked bread. The final meal is very casual and Michel is a very warm host. The meal was served with wine and finished off with a lovely dessert.Overall, this was a lovely day out and we left with a big smile on our faces as well as the knowledge of how to cook with a Tagine."

After a show round, tea/coffee and the usual getting to know everyone (there were 7 people on the course including us) we proceeded with the day. We started with a bread demonstration, then on to a spice quiz and then started to make bread, our tagine (beef with pears and orange) and learn about Moroccan cookery.The setting for the day is excellent, Michel and his team could not be more helpful and the food you produce is delicious. We ate the food we had cooked outside in the sun which was excellent.All the recipes are included as is transportation to and from Marrakech.Our day didn't start well but we thoroughly enjoyed the day and would recommend the course regardless of your cookery knowledge or skill."

It was great to experience the spices workshop, prepare the Moroccan bread and tajine. We learned a lot, to use at home about spices and cooking skills. Now we will grate our tomatoes if we want to have a sauce, instead of peeling them first :-)We found Michel and the Moroccan chef very welcoming, and heartwarming.He even dropped us off at a supermarket, as they were hard to find in Marrakesh."

Beautiful way to spend a day, we had a great meal and I was very happy to learn the Moroccan way of cooking from a wonderful Moroccan chef! The owner was very passionate, knowledgeable guy who clearly loves what he does. I can highly recommend the experience to others!As far as my personal experience, I went with eight people including family members, and it was a very good activity for a larger group. We were all able to interact and be included without any of the difficulty or embarrassment that can sometimes happen when you're traveling en masse."

Being a bit experienced in cooking courses I can tell you that this class was the most fun, enriching and versatile. Blindfolded we learned to recognize the scent of different herbs, we were taught how to make bread, pancakes, salads and a very tasty lamb tajine. Appealing to everyone, experienced cook or beginning amateur. A well-trained teacher, charming host, delicious recipes: this course has it all. In between the cooking we had a chat, a drink and a laugh. The piece de resistance was eating our selfmade dinner outdoors while enjoying the beautiful scenery. Accessible to people who are interested in local food, who want to broaden their culinary horizon or who are just looking for a fun way to spend their day. Highly recommended !"

Collected on time from our Riad by the friendly Michel then on arrival we were offered a choice of mint tea or coffee. We had the mint tea which was excellent and refreshing. The course was excellent, I knew nothing about the spices used in Moroccan dishes or how to make a lamb tagine, flat bread or Moroccan salads and more. By way of cooking what you learn in the course and then eating what you have created was an enriching experience. One that we look forward to sharing when we cook for our friends. After the course we went to the Hammam (this was booked with L'atelier) we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the relaxing massage. Overall a great day out!"

We were whisked away by van from the Palais Bahai in the heart of the medina by a mad Frenchman into the nearby Moroccan countryside for an unforgettable experience. After sniffing our way through a rigorous sampling of local spices wearing opaque purple sunglasses, we were placed in front of propane burner tables lined with cute prep bowls of pre-chopped spices, vegetables and a hunk of raw chicken. Following the instructions of our charming and beautiful Moroccan chef, we punched bread dough and cooked it, watched salad preparation and turned our raw ingredients into a spectacular tajine. Enjoying the fruits of our labour on outdoor tables in the sun in the olive orchard with a glass of wine and our loved ones, life couldn't be better.The timing and logistics of the event went like clockwork. Beautifully planned and executed - with love.A great way to plug into the culture and have a lot of fun. Most highly recommended."

He replied and said the dates I had suggested were free. He also mentioned the mystical spa. He told me up front of the prices and said there was no obligation to go to the spa. But I thought it would make a great day out for my daughter (28yrs ) and myself.We were collected from the medina in marrekesh in the morning by michel in a minibus clearly marked with faim d'epices on the sides. There was a young couple in the van when we got in and then we picked up another young couple on the way. By the time we got to the farm, we had introduced ourselves and was chatting happily together.The building was clean and bright, although a little chilly indoors. Michel did put heaters on which helped and once we started cooking we warmed up.We started by having mint tea and a chat about what was going to be happening throughout the day. We met couscous the cat. I liked the lovely clean white apron and now wish I'd bought one.The cookery session itself was easy to follow and michel wandered around chatting to us and assisting if we needed it. He also took photos too, which he emailed to us with more recipes to try. The spice blind test was interesting. And I enjoyed making the couscous. ( the stuff ive tried in the uk, I've not liked ) but I liked mine. We was also given a certificate with the recipe of the food we made that day. A nice souvenir. We sat and ate our food outside in the sunshine. Some had wine and we all had delicious homemade icecream. Michel sat with us and we all chatted and relaxed.It was later than planned when we set off for the spa. But it was all well worth it as its a beautiful place and we were made to feel welcome and comfortable. The hamman and massage was lovely and relaxing. The only thing I can think of which wasn't positive, was that we were not told until after the spa and massage that we would not be taken back to town by michel. We got lost and it took ages to find our way back in the dark and we wasn't as relaxed as we should have been when we got back to the riad. one couple had to find a taxi to get back to ther hotel which wasn't in the medina.I read a negative review about a hard sell to get people to buy products. It cant have been at faim d'epices as michel pointed over at a small corner of the room and said \" there are things to buy if you would like to\". And that was more or less it. My daughter bought a tassel and as michel didn't have any change he said to pay for it at the spa. Which we did.But the cookery day was a fun experience and I would definitely recommend it. Thanks to all the staff and michel.We also want to say hi to the other 2 couples and thank them for being part of making the day such fun. Wendy and Laura"

We were not disappointed. Michel the owner was friendly and welcoming from the moment he picked us up from our hotel. When we arrived at the farm, we were offered (excellent) coffee and tea, and the format of the day was outlined. We started with a bread making demonstration from the school's cook Nezha, folowed by a spice workshop. The workshop was particularly interesting and we learned a great deal. Michel has a detailed knowledge of morrocan spices and had lots of useful tips for buying good quality spices. We then made our own bread and went on to make a traditional tagine. The tagine recipe that day used beef, but as my daughter is vegetarian, they provided vegetables to make a traditional berber tagine. We were shown how to make a selection of salads, and after baking our bread, we ate the delicious lunch on the terrace at the back of the workshop building. Michel included wine with the meal, which was unexpected, but very welcome. And the chefs also served some a selection of delicious homemade ice cream for desert. More coffee and then copies of the recipes and a complementary bag of spices were handed out, then back to the city. A fantastic way to spend a day and the food was delicious."

            "review": "A true taste of Marrakesh. At a bit of a loss for something to do on our last day in Marrakesh, we found a leaflet for a cookery course. Since it was booked up, our riad manager went online and found Faim d'\u00c9pices for us.The day began with a pickup near to our riad. We were slightly startled when a minibus which was obviously full went past us, but then a man approached us and explained that we would be transferred in the Land Rover (we were quite glad of this when it came to going down the somewhat rough road to get to the centre!) On arrival, our first impressions were of a clean, well-equipped and beautifully decorated building, and we were invited to sit down, drink some mint tea and chat with the other people on the course before getting down to work. The day was a mixture of watching demonstrations and doing practical cooking, and the balance seemed perfect. We made 'batbout', the ubiquitous Moroccan bread in stages, first watching a demonstration then progressing to make our own, under the watchful eye of our instructor, who was ready to step in and sprinkle a handful of flour or a little more water in order to rescue our lumpy mush from disaster! The main recipe of the day was a chicken tagine with olives and preserved lemons, and all of the ingredients were prepared and neatly laid out for us: all that was left for us to do was follow the instructions, put them in the tagine, put the lid on and smell the gorgeous aromas... Whilst we waited for them to cook, we had another demonstration, this time of three Moroccan salads, and also learnt to make 'Msemen', breakfast pancakes (which involved us all having a go at rolling and shaping the dough, with varying degrees of success!) Once made, it was time to sample: freshly cooked pancakes with honey and a new product Michel was trialling: cactus flower jam, as well as bread dipped in olive oil from the trees growing outside.Another key part of the day was the spices workshop. Armed with blacked out sunglasses, Michel passed around dishes of typical Moroccan spices, herbs etc. for us to attempt to identify by smell alone. As well as informing us of their culinary uses, we were also treated to interesting facts, such as how to tell if your saffron or argan oil has been bulked out with the addition of other ingredients! By this time, of course, we were quite peckish, and were delighted to be led outside, where a table had been laid on the terrace, complete with wine for those who wanted it and fresh orange juice for those that didn't. Huge bowls of the salads were passed around, along with pickled cactus shoots (an acquired taste, perhaps...). The star attraction was of course our tagines, carefully watched over by our instructor so that they were cooked to perfection. And to finish, a trio of homemade ice creams (mint tea, vanilla and date) served with msemen and fresh fruit, followed by tea or coffee. The food was of course gorgeous, and served in very generous portions. Yet far more important was the friendly and welcoming attitude of everyone at Faim d'\u00c9pices, and their attention to detail. Two vegetarians on the course were offered the opportunity to make a vegetable cous cous dish. I was unable to finish my tagine, but they were happy to package the remainder in a tupperware box for me to take away. We were also presented, upon leaving, with a bag of ras-el-hanout (a special Moroccan spice blend: this particular one contained 63 different spices) each, as well as a sheet containing all of the day's recipes. The experience did not end there, however: a few days after returning home we were delighted to receive an email with an attachment containing a large selection of other Moroccan recipes and several photographs taken on the day (someone had even taken the time to pick out the photographs which we were in, rather than sending all of the ones of other people in the group). It is this kind of degree of attention which makes Faim d'\u00c9pices stand out. There are lots of courses of this kind in the area, but I doubt that there are any which can surpass Faim d'\u00c9pices in terms of the quality (or quanity) of food, the attitude of the people working there or the overall atmosphere. Even the lady who was unfortunately taken ill early on in the day remarked what good care they had taken of her, and how helpful they had been. This course was definitely one of the highlights of our holiday, and I don't doubt that the recipes will become some of our family favourites!"

After around 30 mins, we arrived at a private house and the cooking area is equipped with AC! Nice and cool inside whilst cooking, warm and sunny outside! Vanessa (review below) was there with us and she pretty much captured everything we did and I agree 100% with her. This is not just a cookery experience, this is a GREAT all-around-taste-of-Marrakech experience. To be honest, there are so many similar experiences out there but Michel's one is the best because he clearly takes care of every single detail to ensure the guests a great time. From the welcoming coffee to the blindfold spice test to the refreshing orange juice midway through our cooking (etc), we felt looked after and not to mention having the chance to acquire a new skill. The best part for me was watching Nezhl (the assistant) cooking and showing us how to make the amazing Marrakech salads, crepes, tagines, bread etc. Afterwards we all ate in the garden and I love, love, love Cous Cous the cat. Everything was amazing. To top this, Michel emailed us after a week with our photos and more recipes. Amazing service. Will return. Don't miss this!"

We emailed Michel while on holiday and he emailed straight back to confirm our booking. Everything was taken care of and we were picked up bang on time!The cookery course was educational and loads of fun. We learned to cook a variety of Moroccan food and were shown how to make much more that we didnt have time in the day to cook ourselves. The food was fabulous and something you could confidently tackle at home!We were even emailed yesterday with a whole array of new recipies to try which is a really nice touch.We had a great day, learned alot and would whole heartedly reccommend this to anyone who is interested in cooking. It is very much worth the money."

I can't think of a single bad thing to say about our day. Michel was great. He entertained all our questions about Marrakech and we had some interesting conversations. Everything was well planned and ran smoothly. We could tell that a lot of thought had been put into making this class the best it can be-- for example we were e-mailed pictures of us cooking, taken by Michel, and additional recipes after coming home from our vacation. And I can't forget to mention the delicious foods from the bread all the way to the dessert taught by our wonderful teacher, Nezha. They were very accomodating to our one vegetarian in the group. It was nice to escape out into the quiet countryside of Marrakech after 2 days of being in the city center. 2 of us ended the day with the spa package while 1 chatted with Michel on the rooftop terrace of the spa and enjoyed some mint tea while he waited. We loved \"Couscous,\" the Faim d'Epices pet cat!"

You learn so much about the Moroccan culture and cooking it's unbelievable. Plus you can taking your learnings home with you and cook for your friends and family. It's a very relaxing and laid back experience and best of all they give you the recipes so you don't have to try to memorize it while learning. This is a MUST DO and also the location is out on a farm so you get to see a different area of Marrakech. p.s.~ wait to buy your tajine, spices or spice holder until you go to the cooking class. they offer all of those items for sale there and they are a third of the price that you would pay in the souks and much better quality."

Throughout the class Michel and his staff made sure everyone was having fun and also understanding the recipes (in both French and English). We ended the class eating the meals we prepared outside on the patio. My husband has never taken a cooking class and LOVED it. Michel made sure we had the recipes to take home and even sent extras in the following week. It was a wonderful and fun day! I highly recommend this for anyone, Michel and his staff are great!"

No. My biggest issue is that the cooking class (including getting to and from the school outside the city) and the meal takes up most of the day, so after a few hours I felt like we were losing precious time during my first trip to Marrakech. I admit I misjudged the time involved. The meal our group prepared was fine, but not as tasty as I had in other places in Marrakech, even at inexpensive restaurants or at the main square. I would say to give this a try if you've seen and done everything else in Marrakech and just don't know what to do with a spare or remaining day. Otherwise as a first-time visitor I recommend that you concentrate on exploring the city and the souks."

We were picked up by Michael at the exact point that had been communicated via email weeks before, at the right time! The van was comfy and the host was a lovely man speaking an array of languages and ensuring that we were cool enough and that everyone in the van was spoken to and made to feel welcome. It was here I noticed that he had a thing for the colour purple! Anyhow, on arriving at his place (about 10 mins drive) I felt instantly 'at home', it was exactly the kind of place I would love to buy in Marrakech, quirky and with that traditional moroccan charm but far enough away from the mad crowds and those blummin scooters! The day began with a little time for chat and of course....mint tea, of which I politely rejected as, to be frank, i don't like it! so I opted for a glass of ice cold bottled water but Michael was very accomodating to everyones needs, offering coffee etc also. We then had a talk on spices and got to wear some uber fasionable sun glasses for a blind smelling of the herbs and spices and to acquire some knowledge, it was informative and enjoyable but perhaps a tad too long, maybe about 3 mins to long but then this sounds petty! I think it was more to do with me having a dodgey back and i was sitting down so got a little restless! with my bum off the seat we headed over to the well set up kitchen and began our morning of cooking, everything we cooked was demonstrated beautifully by a lovely woman with the nicest teeth ive ever seen! She was very through and she ensured that she spoke in both French and English but to be honest you just had to watch what she was doing and use your common sense. I won't spoil it for you by giving away all the details of what you cook etc, after making our lunch we settled down to lunch alfresco with a glass of vino!! yum! yes, morocco maybe a dry country in some respects but it was lovely to be offered a glass of wine by the host and I fully expected to pay for it as extra to the days charge but that wasn't the case.... a nice touch. In short, this place is amazing, I am ultra jealous and even went as far to say Id happily work there...i most certainly would! Please take some time out and way from the hectic medina and enjoy a chilled afternoon of cooking with loved ones in a tranquil little place such as this. I have done two cookery courses in Marrakech now and I don't want to bad mouth the other one as it was good but out of the two I prefered it here. Enjoy!!!"

In the end I went with the extremely positive reviews for Faim D'Epices on Tripadvisor, and we were not disappointed at all!First, it's a great, purpose build location, set on a farm, in the middle of a vegetable garden and orchard, a bit out of the city, which totally adds to the experience.Michel and his team are very welcoming and make everyone feel at ease immediately. Our group was very international, but somehow in a way we were all very similar, and in the same state of mind; to totally enjoy the experience! The team is very well bi-lingual French/ English and the instructions very well explained.A very fun and educational morning well spent, and rounded off with a nice lunch outside on the terrace, enjoying our own creations!Thumbs up for Faim D'Epices, I am definitely recommending it to all my friends."

Michel is such a nice person, from the moment he picked me up at my hotel up until he dropped me off, he is always smiling, very friendly! Clearly that he loves what he is doing and passionate about it!The cooking class is fabulous, very relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff. We learn so much, from spices, making bread from scratch (without using an oven!!!!!!! I love that coz I don't have an oven) , three types of Moroccan salads and beef tajin with pears and orange juice. Oh! I am so proud of myself!! I have a fabulous day! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"

I called to book and informed them my 5 year old son would be joining me and that mum did not eat beef, which was the meat that we would be cooking. (They cook different meats on specified days, check the website).They had not been to our hotel before (Amanjena), but told me not to worry, I wasnt hopefull, but they arrived on time, luckily as if they had been late we may have been caught in the terrist attack bombing.On arrival we were very impressed with the decor, look and feel of the place. My Mother was given Lamb instead of beef and my son was also taken care of, I did think that he would be bored and did loaded my iphone with games for him to play on, but I did not have to take it out once, as he worked at his own station with Michel and his chef.Michel gave an induction on the herbs and spices, Sounds boring but was quite interesting. We were given a demo and then had to go back to our stations and cook the food as we saw on the demo, dont worry you are not left alone.Once the food was cooked we enjoyed eating it in the beautiful gardens.Tip:Bring money with you as they have a reasonably priced small gift shop with items that I didnt see in the souks/markets.Michel will take of you and your family. I really enjoyed the experience and would like to say a big thank you to Micheal and his team."

We picked up 6 other people and were taken out to the cookery school, a purpose built buiding in the countryside.Everything was laid out for us - very Masterchef! During the day we learned about spices (we did a blind testing) we learnt how to cook tagine of beef/chicken with pears and candied orange peel; made and cooked our own flatbread and learnt how to make 3 Moroccan salads and pancakes.It was thorouhly professional and great fun. We then sat down to our own cooked lunch with a glass of wine and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There was also a very friendly cat called Cous Cous to keep us company.We were taken back to our riad about 4-4.30 after a great day. It was good to meet Michel and the other fellow cooks! I would recommend anyone to do this."

I felt that we had enough time to ask questions and meet the other people at the class which then made for a sociable lunch on the terrace. Michele is a lovely guy with a wonderful sense of humour and he certainly made our last day in Morocco one of the best we had. If you like food you cannot go wrong with this course!"

We booked this as we needed to get out of Medina as 5 days in this crazy place is way too much, and we are certainly happy we did.Firstly poor Michael was very patient with us as we were supposed to go to the farm yesterday, BUT as no one informed us that clocks did not go back in marrakech we were waiting at 1030 thinking it was 0930 and as we then thought that no one had come to collect us, I phoned Michael to complain about the fact no one picked us up but as we later learnt it was us on the wrong time! Michael kindly offered to collect us the next day and he was prompt picking us up in a lovely clean mini bus and took us to the farm.The establishment was very clean and well organised. Michael was chatty and lively and we learnt a lot about spices and generally about Morocco. He has a lovely little gift shop on premise too where we bought our tajin pot. The cooking was clear and instructions were easy to follow. Our lunch was delicious and we were stuffed, also the setting was lovely. At the end we were given recipe cards for what we cooked and he also have us a small bag of rare spices.It was well worth it. A lovely day. We are so glad we did not miss it because of the clocks and would recommend this to everyone visiting marrakech."

Although ages ranged considerably and three nationalities were represented, it was fun as well as educational. Michel picked us up at our hotel (some way from the centre of Marrakesh) which was a huge bonus. He is obviously very knowledgeable about the locale and we had many interesting conversations during the day ranging from good restaurants to religion! The lovely teacher was patient and so enthusiastic about our efforts which, it has to be said, were delicious! We spent the late afternoon/evening at the Mystic Spa which is offered as a deal with Faim d'epices. Please see separate review for that. Michel is a lovely person and really makes the Faim d'epices experience unforgettable. In case we should forget, he has emailed photos taken on the day. Brilliant!"

My partner booked this trip as a surprise, and I was certainly very impressed with the high standards and fantastic organisation of the outing. For someone who hasn't boiled an egg or chopped a vegetable in over ten years, you can imagine how daunted I felt about cooking traditional chicken tajine! However, Michel (the chief organiser) was so warm, friendly, and incredibly patient that, amazingly, I didn't feel out of my depth at any one point. He and our female instructor were always at hand and ensured that no one felt left behind or made any real errors. We also had a great tutorial on spices which I knew very little about initially but now feel more confident in using. The proof of our success was in the end result - a divine meal cooked by ourselves! The spa visit that followed was exquisite. Most couple treatments are not felt to be very intimate but this certainly was; the decor was very pretty and serene, the treatments were thorough and very relaxing, and we even spent time in a private jacuzzi on the rooftop with full privacy and no sense of being rushed at all. I would thoroughly recommend the full day schedule to all visitors to Marrakech. It's a wonderful treat that will leave you feeling you have had not only a culturally enriching experience but also a very fun and relaxing day."

We had a great day and really enjoyed learning how to make bread, a chicken and olive tagine and also watching moroccan salads being made and the dessert. Michel and the chef were great and made the day, they answered our questions and were very friendly. The cooking was well managed and you didn't feel like you were standing over the stove all day. When we finished and it was time to eat, you were sat at a lovely table with the salads and your tagine and glass of wine, the dessert was accompanied by gorgeous homemade ice cream including one made of the mint tea which you will drink alot of on your trip, this was my favourite, and also we had some cactus fruit which was very tasty. It was lovely being away from the centre of town which made the whole experience very relaxing. We thoroughly enjoyed it and really recommend it."

Whether you're a keen cook or not, it's like being back at cooking lessons at school, you're guaranteed to have fun and remember this trip!We travelled in a group of 4 (two couples), and booked 2 days before via an email to Michel (the owner) on the faim d'epices website. I asked for a day that we wanted to do it, and he replied swiftly, asking us of where we were staying, and as easy as that we were booked in for a 9.35am pick up at a parking place near our Riad in the medina. Michel was the extremely friendly and pleasant French owner, he was very hands-on too, so personally picked us all up from our different locations in Marrakech (whether you're staying in a hotel or a riad), and greeted us with tea/coffee to start with, orange juice mid-morning, and then a glass or wine during lunch.Very knowledgable host, and learnt a lot about spotting high quality spices, (so don't go buying haphazardly in the souks beforehand!) and then cooking at our own workstations with Nezha as our cooking guide for the day. We followed step-by-step demonstrations making our own fish tagines, made our own bread from scratch, and watched live demonstrations of how to make sweet Morrocan pancakes, and 3 different types of Morrocan style salads. We got to eat all of these things on the day, and it was hugely satisfying making our own dishes from scratch, and getting to eat it all for lunch. Was provided with a lovely dessert to finish it off by Michel, three scoops of homemade icecream with sweet pancake. Booking this faim d'epices on their website, in combination with the Mythic oriental spa package is most recommended to be done on the last day of your trip. Great opportunity for you to wind down and relax, and really feel pampered and treated like royalty in the Mythic spa. Can't say much more than this- definitely a must-do in Marrakech- a perfect day to experience the two great things that signify Marrakech- the tagine, and a hammam spa bath!"

We received a warm, friendly welcome and the cooking experience was calm and relaxed throughout, Michel and his staff having the ability to teach people with different levels of expertise. For example, I have little cooking expertise whilst my wife is already a good cook yet we both found it informative and fun. The method of introducing us to the different spices and herbs was unusual and enjoyable. Sitting down with the staff and other people on the course (four others when we attended) to eat the meals we had prepared (with wine included) brought the activity to a relaxing end.Michel and his staff deserve credit for the whole experience, which was excellent and we can certainly recommend this activity as an insight into Moroccan culture as well as providing a welcome counter balance to the 'hustle and bustle' that is Marrakesh!Do take advantage of the reduced priced twin activity with the Mythic Oriental Spa, which Michel takes you to in Marrakesh after the cooking experience. These two activities together were brilliant and made it into a whole day (morning to early evening), relaxing experience."

We cooked a beef and orange tagine - a faim d'epices very own recipe, totally delicious.Following the day we took advantage of the special offer to also visit a spa - and again Michel has ensured the best possible quality in the spa he has partnered with, his recommendation is definitely worth taking note!Thanks Michel and bon chance for the future!!"

Even better, is being able to recreate it once you get home; which is why we chose to spend the best part of a day learning to cook a Moroccan meal with Michel and his team at Faim d'Epices.Michel picked us up, as arranged, in the morning and after collecting the other participant we headed to his purpose-built atelier on the outskirts of the city. On the menu: chicken tagine with olives and lemon, served with traditional Moroccan bread and three salads. With an olive grove and vegetable garden on site, you can rest assured that only the freshest ingredients are used.First up , the bread making was demonstrated by the chef, Nehza, before we set off to prepare our own. With our dough safely cosseted in a tea towel to do its stuff, Michel then conducted a 'blind smelling' of spices to help us familiarise ourselves with the key ingredients of Moroccan cuisine. Next, we prepared our tagines and while they were cooking Nehza showed us how to make three Moroccan salads. With the tagines ready, we then cooked our bread on the stove before learning how to make the pancakes.With the cooking complete, we sat down to enjoy our lunch with a glass of wine, followed by a dessert of pancakes and local ice cream. Michel gave us a sheet of recipes detailing all the things we had made on the day before taking us to the Mythic Oriental Spa for our treatments (we had booked the cookery/spa combination). A follow-up email with photographs and further recipes was waiting for me when I got back home.If you're looking for a break from the souks and sights during your stay in Marrakech, the combination of Michel's enthusiasm and the relaxed environment of the cookery school makes this the perfect holiday experience."

Michel picked us up bang on 9:30am, a few more budding chefs joined us from various locations around Marrakech.Michels laid back manner and the Moroccan chefs direct but pleasant instructions made the cooking easier for those of us unsure of our Tagine skills. The centre looked after our needs all day with the sun beating down outside, Michelkept us watered, and entertained.My wife and i had a brilliant day, not just the cooking but the whole ambience of the place and Michel moves at a slowerpace than all of marrakech, which is nice. After we cooked, we all sat down to our meal and Michel offered us some wineto go with our tagine meal, we could have sat all evening as we were really enjoying the whole atmosphere and Michel wasin no hurry to send us on our way but one couple had a prior arangement so unfortunately we had to go !!!We were tempted to book for a second visit but thought we'd keep it for another time. Great value for an experience whichis hard to come by in this fast moving world of ours."

Michel was the perfect host, friendly, and informative. His Moroccan chef was a quiet efficient lady who demonstrated the dishes and helped, with eternal patience, the preparation of the dishes. This class/experience is great for the enthusiastic chef and the wannabe (or even the one dragged along!). Great introduction to Moroccan cooking and the herbs and spices they use, with excellent tips to find the genuine spices in the Souks. A beautifully fitted out building with a Moroccan touch, courtesy of Michel's previous career and profession for interior design. An experience not to be missed."

As mentioned below the day begins with Michel collecting you from agreed location, heading to the villa, enjoying a mint tea (naturally) and meeting fellow chefs. We were then given a Moroccan spice smell test and lesson (very interesting), shown how to make flatbread from scratch and also how to make three different salads.Now the hands-on bit! We made bread and a chicken and olive tagine with candied lemon peel. Dessert was three gourmet ice creams with crepes. Our 'teacher' was helpful and friendly and the food... well, it was certainly the best meal we had on our visit to Marrakech. We were given freshly squeezed orange juice, a glass of local wine and coffee at the end. Michel chatted to us and gave us a 'thank you' gift of recipe cards and a bag of specially prepared Moroccan spices.All in all a fun experience, great day out (and rest from the madness of the Medina) and an excellent host. Fantastiques!"

He had a great personality, was fun and interesting. He made a real effort to make us feel welcome.

            "review": "\\\\Know your Spices? If not, Michel will guide you through. My daughter's dream was to visit Marrakesh, and as an ardent cook, this trip, however short, had to include a class in Moroccan cooking! Although my first thought was that the time would be better spent exploring the Medina, I must say, I found the day delightful and completely worth while.First of all it was made very easy and convenient with essentially door to door transportation. Michel was very punctual and easy to recognize. The class takes place about 20 minutes form town in an airy and spacious room equipped with multiple individual work stations located on a small private farm.After a relaxing tea/coffee we watched and learned how to make the traditional bread by a young Morrocan woman , Michel moderated when necessary. This was followed by a blindfolded smell test to identify the spices. This at first intimidated me as I knew the only smells I can readily identify are skunk and cookies in the oven. It was however really fun and I feel I can now probably identify mint and cinnamon as well.Thereafter we made our own bread, ( not nearly as well), prepared a meal in the tajin of veal, artichokes and peas, again under excellent supervision. Luckily neither of us lost a finger trying to cut onions the Moroccan way!We had a relaxed lunch, consuming our creations, which were delicious , along with a nice glass of wine, and we headed back to town mid afternoon. The spa option had sounded intriguing as well and had we had more time, this would have been a done deal. Next time!!Anyway, Michel is charming ( don't get a big head if you read this) , we learned a lot from him and had a great time.Thank you ladies and man of L' Atelier Faim d'Epices!!Michel was dleightful and a source of information about Marrakesh.For a very relaxed and informative cooking experience I would definitely recommend Faim d'EpicesChristine"

My husband is a Dutch man that thinks it's acceptable to serve pasta and ketchup to a Sicilan family so I was more than worried when I decided to book us, as a couple, on this cooking class at Faim d'Epices. I relayed my worried to Michel, the proprietor, who assured me that there would be no problem, the teachers were excellent chefs and would be able to help even the most inept of cooks...he also mentioned that it wasn't only about the cooking, it was about having fun while learning. I will say, KUDOS!!!! We had an absolute blast learning to cook, but then to be able to sit down and eat the food we'd made without having Pepto Bismol as a starter was amazing. The teachers were fantastic, Michel was great fun, and the escape into the countryside facilities was a very welcome break from the bustle of the big square. Just before we left for Morrocco, Michel (who had remained in constant contact with us since we first booked) advised us of a special they had arranged with the Mythic Oriental Spa. We booked this special and you can read my review about the hammam when you've finished reading this...but two definite MUSTS when you're booking your vacation to Marrakesh, book the cooking experience with Faim d'Epices and definitely, take the hammam package!"

While I was researching things to do in Marrakech, I came across the reviews for Faim d'Epices. I was immediately interested in signing up for the cooking class/spa combination offer. I spoke to my friends about it, and even though they were not interested in the cooking portion, I decided to take the cooking class anyway and just meet them at the spa afterwards. I am so happy that I decided to do this on my own - it was the highlight of my trip! It was great to be able to escape the madness of the medina, and leave Marrakech for a few hours. Michel was a terrific host from start to finish - he picked me up as planned and on time at the agreed upon location, was warm and welcoming at all times, and dropped me off at the door of the spa afterwards where my friends were waiting for me. The entire staff at Faim d'Epices is warm and welcoming, the facilities are spacious, the equipment is clean and very well-maintained, the cooking presentations were informative and interesting, the actual cooking was fun, and the food was delicious! I have some basic knowledge of and interest in cooking, but I think even if you do not, this is definitely something you will enjoy. Also, this is perfectly suited for solo travelers, couples, families, young and old alike. I also found the cost very reasonable for the amount of time and quality of the program. Do not hesitate to take a class at Faim d'Epices - it's a must do while in Marrakech!"

I actually found Faim D'Epices on tripadvisor and after some very efficient comms from Michel we were booked in and everything was explained very well. We met Michel at 10am and after 10 minutes it felt like we were old friends! He is such a nice guy, with an infectious personality and is obviously passionate about what he does. We were driven to a farm about 20 mins away, where we given mint tea and orange juice. Michel explained the order of the day \u2013 welcome drinks, spice education and blindfold test, and then cooking bread, a chicken tagine and being shown how to make various salads and a kind of crepe desert. For the cooking class, hamman and massage (there is a package) it was 1080 which is a bargain. All the ladies at the farm were lovely and when I asked for some chilli fr the tagine they simply went to the farm and got some for me! After cooking the bread and tagine, we sat down to enjoy our meals with a nice glass of white wine. Michel then dropped us at the spa around 3ish. A lovely day out, well organised and well worth doing! A few other comments: All staff were lovely, all cooking facilities vrey clean, the farm ws nice and we saw a wild peacock, toilets clean. If you go to Marrakech make sure you do this and you will not be disappointed!Michel \u2013 thanks for a great day and we have already made a chicken tagine upon our return to London and my wife even said it tasted just like the one we made with you!"

The morning pick-up was a half hour late, already not a good sign. The facility is quite a distance outside the city. We were met by a French man, who we understood was the owner, but after a few pleasantries he vanished until the end of our session. I got the impression that their large building is geared for large tourist groups (thankfully there were only a few other people there the day we went). The class was run by a Moroccan woman who was nice but unfortunately wasn't able to explain things very well in English. I am curious by nature and was asking lots of questions and not really understanding the explanations, so I ended up losing interest about halfway through the class. The food we prepared was good, but I had better in simple restaurants in Marrakech. My biggest complaints are that there was no visit of a local market (which I understood was included) which could have added a slight degree of authenticity to the experience, and that there was a VERY hard sell later -- quite a bit of pressure on us to buy spices from their boutique and to sign up for some kind of spa which I think they own. Only when I made it very clear that we weren't at all interested did they stop what was bordering on harassment."

Traditional Moroccan bread, A trio of Moroccan salads to start, Lamb & Prune Tagine for main, and traditional Moroccan pancake for desert.The food was delicious, which was surprising seeing as I cooked the majority of what I was eating! This just proves the quality of the lesson we were given!We were given our recipes at the end, and we've since received an email from Michel including extra recipes we can try, plus some photos he took us of during the day, which I think is a lovely touch!

He is French, but speaks almost flawless English. The location is a few miles out of the city, away from the noise and set on a peaceful farm, overlooking the garden where they grow there own vegetables, olives, lemons and recently planted orange trees. They get around the distance issue, by offering you free transportation to and from the cookery school.You'll learn to cook tagines, make breads, pancakes, salads... and teste your senses on a spices workshop - learning about their uses, smells and importantly, how to tell the good from the bad when buying.For me, the location was idyllic, all of the staff were friendly and attentive, the food was great, the learning experience useful, the spice workshop was fun and we were well looked after. Drinks always available. We took home the recipes we had learnt that day, and when we got home, Michel had emailed us a handful of other recipes, as well as some candid photos taken of us during the class.TIP - We took up an offer, to go to a spa after the class at a discounted rate with a company they had formed a friendship with.

We thoroughly recomend any one who enjoys food and good company to take time to experience this day, as you will enjoy it."

She easily booked it online by emailing Michele, and we were pleasantly surprised when we received such a quick, accommodating response (after traveling a bit you become accustomed to slow responses). After reading all the fantastic reviews on here we were very excited, and the class lived up to all of the expectations. Michele picks yo up in a van from your hotel (very convenient) and then drives you to the nice location outside of the city. At first we were nervous that we wouldn't be able to find the van or that he wouldn't know who we were, but the van was clearly marked and he came right on time so that was not a problem at all. The cooking class itself was great, and I will definitely use the recipes I learned and that Michele kindly sent us. I really would recommend this to anyone going to Marrakech, even for a short trip!"

They're well-behaved kids but it does mean that the cooks have to help more than usual and be a bit more patient with the pace - which they did very well. They loved the spice identification game and have made Daddy do it at home since - with much sneezing! The food was lovely, the day was thoroughly enjoyable and our efforts at replicating the recipes since we returned home have been very successful so the lessons even worked!

Michel picked us up from our hotel in Marrakech on time and with a smile, checked if we wanted wine with lunch so he could drop by supermarket on way, and had jovial chat all the way there. We were scheduled in to make \"Beef, pear and candied orange tagine\" and it did not disappoint. There were 5 of us on the course (2 booked at last minute and didn't eat beef so Michel switched theirs to chicken without querying or worrying) and we went through the processes of making bread, the tagine, various salads and their presentation. We had \"blind\" sniff tests on loads of different herbs and spices so we would be able to recognise them by smell as well as sight (helpful for souk shopping later on). The ladies who did the lessons were very helpful and extremely proficient in the kitchen with Michel translating over their shoulders. We finished off by devouring all the food we made followed by handcrafted ice-cream. Michel then helpfully dropped us around the corner from our hammam so we didn\u2019t have to go through the souks to find it. I couldn\u2019t have had a better experience. One criticism would be that we should have been told not to eat breakfast beforehand as we had to be rolled out the door at the end of the day. Merci beaucoup Michel and ladies."

Michel and the rest of the staff were very affable and made the experience delightful. The cooking lessons were fun and reasonable enough to be duplicated on return home.

After being stood up by another cooking school, I called L'atelier Faim d'Epices in desperate hope of booking onto a class the next day and ended up getting so much more than I expected!!The orginal dish of the day was meat but, during booking, when I told Michel (the owner) I am a fishteria, he was totally flexible and said he'll change it to a fish tagine straight away. Prompt pick up on the day by a clearly branded van (so you don't need to keep looking around 'trying' to spot the right person) and comfortable transfer to a very nice out-of-town location for the class. The decor and view from the place is amazing and a delight to just being there even if not doing anything else! Rather than being cramped in a little kitchen, the area is spacious, tastefully decorated with moroccan lamps and paintings, and looking out into the open garden! What luxury it was to be able to cook in such an environment! We learnt to make bread, tagine, pancakes hands-on and watched demonstration of making 3 salads (which we later ate with our meal). Michel was such an animated character and created a great atmosphere, while the teachers were patient and professional. The flow of the class was really well managed as well with the doing (actual cooking), watching (demo) and learning (spice workshop) nicely arranged so you are never doing the same thing for an extended period of time. After cooking, we all sat down to eat looking out to the garden and chatting away with Michel and the other participants. Michel also gave us a little tour of the garden where they grow all the vegetables they use in the class (guaranteed organic and fresh!) and showed us the olive trees (which supplied the olive oil in the class!). This is more an enjoyable day out than merely a cooking class, the whole experience was fantastic and I would recommend to it to anyone even if you have no desire to become the next masterchef!"

I asked many questions about the area as well and about the souqs and he was very helpful. The class was awesome for all ages, I am 22 and I loved it. My class only had 2 people in it which was amazing most places would not run unless they had a minimum of 4 people or more so I was extremely happy with that. I also had to change dates of my class at the last minute due to a friend only being able to visit me on a certain day so I was very pleased that it was no hassle for him and had a very prompt responses to any questions i had. I learnt soo much - more than I would compared to watching masterchef or something. I learnt all about spices and recognizing them and how to make them from scratch and which ones to combine, we learnt how to make bread, 3 salads (which I happened to also have at a restaurant that night), a desert, and a main meal (for me was a berbere tagine). Their teaching methods are really good, i can remember exactly how to make everything and the correct method. The facilities are amazing - purposely built for the cooking school, situated just outside marrakech next to a farm so all produce is fresh from the farm. I have taken a cooking class in Thailand a year and a half ago and I thought that was good, but this class was the best, great value for money and well worth it, if i ever return to marrakech i will definately take up another class."

I appreciated that the instructors put effort into their demonstrations and gave us one -on-one instruction to make sure that we were cooking everything correctly. They really did a great job of showing us a meal that, while absolutely delicious and sophisticated, could definitely be made at home. Michel makes sure that you have all the recipes before you leave as well. He is a genuinely nice person, a great host and makes sure you have fun while cooking!

Michel the host picked us up promptly from our hotel, a pleasure to be with all day. Firstly we were taught how to make traditional bread and then a session on the various spices used. We then got into the cooking, individual stations well spaced out and around the chef, Mouna who really knew her stuff ! We made traditional bread and a chicken tagine, it was great fun doing this and even better when we sat down with wine to try out our own cooked food. Michel was at hand all the time, engaging in conversation and talking about where the spices come from. All in all a very enjoyable experience and one not to be missed. My partner researched many other places and this definitely lived up to then reputation. Worth every penny (or Dirham), ended with some refreshing mint tea, which complimented the fresh orange earlier. When we left we were given a recipe scroll in a lovely glass phial and the promise of more recipes by email.

This would also give me the opportunity to see some of the surroundings since we were only staying for a weekend.We got picked up by the minivan not far from the riad where we were staying. Michel, one of the owners would stay with us from the very start all through the day, making sure we had everything we could ever need, and with a charming French accent he would also act as translator. We were to make the famous chicken tajine with pickled lemon and red olives.The drive was quick, their house is situated 15 to 20 minutes outside Marrakesh, in a huge and beautiful garden surrounded by olive trees. This atmosphere really changes from down town Marrakesh (Medina), and really gave me the taste for discovering more of the Moroccan country side.The class room has been well planned, and everyone got their very own cooking table.Overlooking the olive garden we started to cook; Moroccan bread, 3 different salads and of course the Chicken tajine.My dish was eatable, I'd probably need plenty more time to master the Moroccan cooking. See their cooking in itself doesn't look too difficult, looking that is. Both our teachers, when showing us how to work the dough, chop the onion or water the chicken just seemed to have magic hands. In Moroccan homes, one's never allowed to touch the food with the left hand for hygienic reasons, they hardly ever use a cutting board, but prefer to hold the onion in one hand, chopping with the other... To sum up, I was amazed by their cooking techniques and next time I'm back in Marrakesh I'm definitely signing up for the couscous!Thank you Michel and the whole staff for a wonderful day, I really enjoyed every minute!"

We chatted with Michel- the driver and one of the owners and he explained it has only been up and running a few months but that things are going well and trip advisor has helped a lot!The course is 550dirham (about \u00a345) per person. We were picked up at 9.30 from our riad and drove out of town for about thirty minutes to this little farm in the middle of nowhere. the kitchen was set up nicely with four individual stations set up around the demo station (there was four of us on the course in total). First off we had a talk about different spices and had to identify some by smell. We then watched one of the cooks prepare some bread which we then had to do ourselves at our station. Whilst the bread was resting, we began making our tagine. The cook didn't speak much English but enough for us to understand and Michel translated where necessary.Once our tagine was cooking and bubbling away, we watched the cook prepare two morrocan salads. After a bit more tagine cooking and cooking our bread in a pan, we helped make the dessert.We then ate out on the patio with a glass of wine (included in the price). I enjoyed my tagine but we did the beef day and I think it could have done with another hour or so to tenderise the beef further. the flavour was good though and the salads and bread and dessert were tasty. The different dishes done each day are available online. I might suggest the chicken day as this would need less cooking and therefore be more tender.The little shop there had pots and little tagines for very good prices compared with the souks and tourist shops.The other people on the course had brought their little boy with them and Michel and the cooks let him join in with the cooking and gave him a chef's hat and a little gift. I thought this was a very nice thing to do.We were also very grateful that we were on the course as it was the day the bomb exploded in the main square and if we hadn't been on the course, we almost certainly would have been in the square at the time.A few days later we were in Gueliz when Michel saw us and came over to say hello. He had remembered our names and enquired how our trip was going. I thought this was very nice of him.I would definitely recommend this cooking course and I wish Michel every luck with his venture"

A group of girlfriends and I participated in a cooking glass here, and it was a great experience. Oumaima was a great hostess and she took the time to show us around and explain the mission of Amal. The cooking classes at Amal help to raise money for their women's center which trains women that, for various reasons, need to start over again and helps them find jobs. During the class, Oumaima went through all of the spices and explained a little about them. My group prepared the chicken tajine and it turned out great! Probably one of the best meals, if not the best, we had while in Morocco."

I can't express how much we enjoyed it; the place as a whole and the people were so inspirational. It was great to learn how to make a traditional Moroccan dish but this was made even more special knowing the story behind the organisation. One of the ladies in our group had even booked to go twice in her one week holiday because she was so taken aback by their work. An amazing afternoon and was great to do the workshop in a group and meet people from all over the world. One of our highlights from our trip and we would 10000% recommend!"

There was hardly any cooking to do. Just chopped up an onion, put it in the tangine, put a couple pieces of meat on top and sprinkled some spices and that's all. Then we had to wait for close to two hours for it to get cooked. I wish I had known about the whole process. I would not have brought my children to the class. It was just hard to keep them entertained for two hours in the heat. Good place and good people though."

We learned the components of the different types of tagine (fish, beef, chicken) and made it ourselves. Above all, you learn and contribute to this remarkable center that is empowering local women via a culinary and management program. A short petit taxi ride away from the medina. Michelle Obama was visiting Marrakech the same day and we were really hoping that she would stop by this award-winning group since their goals of education for girls and women were completely aligned.Pearls for your visit:1) Make friends in your cooking class. You all make different kinds of tagines and it is fun to taste each others'2) Buy Moroccan patisserie in the small shop after the class. These were some of the most delicious that we had tasted in our trip3) If you can plan ahead, bring some small kitchen supplies for the women in the kitchen. They will love it!4) OK to bring your family. Nothing is as family bonding as cooking tagine together.Visit the Amal women and take the cooking class - you will not regret it!"

One of the first things we did in Morocco, our cooking class was led by a lovely former student and Oumaima, the communications director who acted as a translator. Throughout the class Oumaima explained everything (why we used certain spices, how the tagine cooks, how to properly stoke the coals, etc), making the experience engaging and memorable. As the tagines cooked, Oumaima gave us a tour of the centre and we mingled with the other class participants, who seemed as impressed as we were by experience. It was amazing to hear some of the women share with us what the program has done for them so far, and to hear the success stories of women who have completed the program. Oumaima told us that the program has been so successful it is expanding this coming year to a second centre where she will be a director - I wish them all the best and can't wait to see where this organization goes! Hopefully Michelle Obama and the girls will pay Amal a visit on their upcoming trip to Morocco!Amal is also a great place to have lunch even without doing the cooking class, so I highly recommend paying a visit to support this organization and enjoy some seriously good Moroccan food. If you have the time though, at around $25 CAD for a class, a meal, recipe card, and a fantastic experience - Amal can't be beat. It's only about 30 min from the medina, and an even quicker taxi ride. Thanks again to everyone at Amal for an amazing afternoon, and for all the good work you do!"

Located in the new town, Amal is essentially a restaurant where women are trained in all areas of catering from cooking to cleaning to taking orders to front of house service. The women come from different backgrounds & are under privileged or deprived due to personal circumstances, & Amal provides them with education & training to enable them with confidence to find employment & become self-reliant. The restaurant has experienced chefs who train & oversee the women. There were six of us who arrived for the lesson & we were greeted by Oumaima, a bubbly, vivacious lady who was our trainer / translator. She provided a explanation of the organisation & their aim before we started cooking. Working in pairs, we made 3 dishes - my wife & I made a chicken pastilla, the others made a lamb tagine & chicken tagine. The lesson was fun & really enjoyable with a tea break in the middle of it where we were given mint tea & taken on a tour of the site and introduced to the apprentice staff. Once everything was cooked, we shared what we'd made which was truly scrumptious! Our lesson was for 2 hours but we ended up staying there for most of the day making new friends. There are plenty of other places you can go to for a cooking demo/lesson but I doubt they provide the opportunity for you to contribute to such a worthwhile cause and have lots of fun in in the process.We left with our dummies full, knowledge bound & souls enriched, with take away souvenirs including recipe cards & aprons we wore. A must do experience for all ages. Thank you Oumaima and your lovely team for making this one of the highlights of our visit to Marrakech. Azad & Saira"

Recently returned from a trip to Marrakech where I visited the Amal Women\u2019s Training Centre and spent a really fun and informative morning taking part in one of their cooking classes. Before travelling to Marrakech I came across the classes and was really keen to visit as it seemed like a really good cause. All communication was really efficient and when I arrived it was well organised and informative. The cooking stations were set up outside in their courtyard where we were split into smaller teams based on our selected dishes however it had been well organised so it allowed the group as a whole to see how other dishes were prepared too and interact with others. It was a really informative session but most of all great fun, we were introduced to the different spices and which ones complimented each other based on the dish, we then prepared our tagines, everyone in the group was given the opportunity to get their hands dirty and contribute to preparing the tagines. Once the tagines were prepared and cooked over the coal stoves we were provided with delicious mint tea and given more information on the project and their social media engagement campaign. After the tagines were ready we all sat as a group to eat the delicious dishes and you are also given a recipe card to take away with you for your selected dish. This is a great way to get an introduction to the tagine dishes whilst you are visiting Marrakech and based in a lovely garden and courtyard. I definitely recommend this cooking class and I would return here in the future for lunch it was such a lovely experience. I recommend to book in advance especially if you are on a short stay or strict schedule so you get the availability you are after."

The person giving us the overview of the facility was a beautiful young woman who is fluent in several languages, plays on the national volleyball team and could not possibly have been a better ambassador for her country and the mission of the Amal Association. My daughter was so fascinated with the facility and the woman that provided the overview, that she talked about it for a day afterward, and I have heard her talking to her friends about the experience.

They get literacy classes, life coaching classes and a confidence boost which means they finally look at themselves as equal members of the society with a future and a place in the world. Amal is a charity wholly funded by their own activities so the cooking classes help you get to grips with a new skill while funding a really worthy cause. This is also a very popular restaurant (in the top 3 of places to eat according to trip advisor) so once we cooked our tajines we got to sit on the terrace and eat it and watch as tourists and locals alike pour in through the main gate for their daily lunch. the place was packed within minutes!

Also we had the chance to see and speak to some of the trainees, and maybe have a different look on things..."

The actual cooking part didn't take long- we prepped and then left the tagines to cook slowly on a charcoal burner and were then shown the kitchens and learnt more about what they do here. It is all for a great cause and the food (which we shared with the others in our group) was really delicious- one of the best tagines we had during our trip! It was around \u00a314 each which we were happy with."

We visited the Amal Women's Training Center for a cooking course, and learned how to make 4 different tagines. Our group ranged in age from 8-48 and it fit all of our needs. Relaxed, authentic, and educational not to mention delicious. Our kids loved using the little bellows to keep the tagine fires hot, and the communal table was such a great way to meet other folks and share the fruit of our morning's efforts. We LOVE what Amal's doing for the community and hope to see them expand further. Great job, you guys! Thanks so much for everything."

The Centre trains women to step out of whatever past they have had and will give them 6 months of training to work in the catering world. In the male world of Morocco this is priceless. The centre links with childcare provision for its trainees, again a priceless commodity.The morning cookery class is (early 2016) 200 dirhams, about \u00a314, $20, \u20ac17 in very round figures, and is limited to 12 participants. The ingredients come laid out and each participant has hands on experience of chopping, cutting, sprinkling, pouring and arranging. On the day I was there it was a tagine session, beef, lamb and chicken. The ingredients all looked very fresh and appetising. The dishes were duly prepared under the keen eye of one of their women chefs and narrated by another of the team. Once prepared the tagines were cooked on traditional charcoal 'braziers' and finally served and eaten. The session includes a mint tea break, other drinks and desserts come extra.There are a plethora of cookery classes in Morocco, this one is simple, understandable, photographable, and well overseen by the Amal team.The restaurant serves a revolving menu so their trainees have the opportunity to learn a wide ranging repertoire. Each day there is more than enough choice for the hungry traveller.Highly recommended for its food, the course and its ethos."

The Amal Women's Training centre is wearing many hats and achieving many things - its a training centre - it is a cooking school for visitors - it is a restaurant for lunch and on every level it is achieving excellence.I was very excited to find this centre on the internet prior to my visit to Marrakech and booked for a cooking class. The communication I had with the centre whilst preparing for my trip with outstanding, they offered tips for travel to their location and a clear outline of what to expect from my trip. When my travelling companion cancelled they were more than accommodating with new arrangements and continued to reply to my enquiries in a timely and polite manner.When I visited the actual centre for my class it was not as easy to find as I had hoped and the local taxis don't seem to be aware of its location but I got there in the end and was received with great welcome into the beautiful quiet and clean Amal Centre.First we were provided with a short tour around the centre and details about it purpose as a Non Governmental Organisation / Non-Profit / Charity. As a centre who provides education and training as well as counselling and financial support to small groups of disadvantaged women over a 6 month period with a view to giving them the skills and confidence to find work and self-sufficiency after graduation - essentially saving the women and their children from lives of poverty and destitution. An excellent project that is achieving excellent results in real-time and also gaining recognition and winning awards in the social forum. Outstanding.The cooking classes and restaurant are the main means to sustain their development. So I was booked in for a cooking class on the Saturday and a lunch visit on the Sunday - trying to get a feel for the whole place.The cooking class was great fun and the highlight of my trip to Marrakech. A group effort really, with everyone watching the others take instruction and build their recipe, rather than couples heading off to corners with their dishes. With three different dishes being requested it did take quite some time to prepare and there were short periods of waiting but the group I was with were chatty and good craic was had throughout the morning. Chicken and Beef Tagines were prepared and put to the stoves using traditional bellows to puff up the fire. In the meantime I tackled the Chicken Pastillia - filo pastry parcel of sweet and savoury goodness!! There was no rush or impatience from the staff, even when it came time to open for their lunch time crowd we were welcomed to sit together and enjoy the fruits of our labour on the outdoor patio. Mint tea and deserts were inevitably ordered as the morning turned into afternoon. And at the close a number of the class - who had never met before today - made groups that headed off to visit the Majorelle Gardens (YSL gardens) not far away. This was certainly a fun way to meet people and take on new cooking skills. A lot of details about the Moroccan traditions, spices and tips on preparation. A super open air class, using lovely fresh ingredients in a spotlessly clean setting. Totally exceeded my expectations for the bargain price of booking. An ideal option for the solo traveller like myself, or a couple or larger group. enjoyable for all.And lunch the next day? - still got lost trying to find the place - how silly am I?? - Was much quieter and more relaxed on the Sunday lunch time. Was provided with a varied and tasty sounding menu from which I chose the breaded fish and molten chocolate cake to follow. Both were really wonderful dishes, I love fish and this was delicious and presented well. Not a big chocolate fan, but the molten chocolate cake was made to look exactly like a burnt rock oozing dark lava and was very so very soft and delicious. Mint Tea, of course. And then able to sit reading my book undisturbed until it was time (unfortunately) to leave for the airport....But not without first buying an arm full of gifts for my friends back home!! Beautifully embroidered aprons, napkins and sturdy cotton shopping bags were available at very reasonable prices - all with the centre logo and all profits to support the centre of course - easy to pack and each one a lovely gift.The bargain price of the lunch here for the quality of the food on offer in a quality, clean setting is in itself a single most important reason for every traveller in Marrakech to visit here. How could anyone want to pass up these prices in the lovely bright and relaxed Gueliz district?? Add to that, the proceeds are going towards a wonderful organisation who works in the local community and uses local produce.. its a win/win... If I am in the city again I would try to have my lunch here most days, its just too good value to miss and on my way out, grab some pastries to go and I have my afternoon snack already on hand!!As for the cooking class, if there had of been an availability for me to do another one on the Sunday I would have booked in a heartbeat. Again, bargain prices for top level experiences. OVERALL - the Amal Women's Training Centre and Restaurant - an absolute must see. Satisfaction Guaranteed. Great Value for Money. A Feel Good Visit on every level - great food, great people and a great sense of having contributed to a worthwhile cause - for a cup of coffee and a quick visit, for a quick grab of a bag of super pastries, for a full lunch date or a morning learning cooking - Go Here. Feel The Welcome. Feel Good in Marrakech."

Oumaima gave us a very good history and tour of the facility which is a restaurant, training centre and cooking school. We could all pick a dish we wanted to make in advance (see website) and it was hands on with the assistance of a staff member. We cooked the tagines on coals and used bellows to get the fire going. All the trainees were busy making food and sweets for the day and were all very pleasant and obviously enjoyed their training. We were given delicious mint tea and later once our tagines were cooked we sat and enjoyed the ample portions with their homemade bread. I bought some of the little Moroccan pastries which were all delicious and each quite different. The cooking school is excellent value at 200dirhams. We were not rushed even though the restaurant opened for lunch when we were there. There are other cooking classes in Marrakech but I would go here again as it helps a very worthy cause of training disadvanted women who are either widows, divorced or single mothers of between 18-40 and helps them to get a job once their six month training is finished."

Being a brit, I was careful with my food and drink whist on holiday in Marrakech as I did not want to get ill. Amal restaurant prepares food in a unique way. The lovely Oumaima (who is the communications officer there) gave me an impromptu tour, when I went and said Hello and advised me, the ladies who are working at this charity learn to prepare food to international standards of cleanliness. I was allowed to take photos (see photos attached) and I found it very funny when the ladies were saying, we just finished serving Lunch and so the kitchen is very messy right now! I felt it was the cleanest restaurant kitchen I had seen (and believe me, this is so very true! having stuck my head round pretty much every restaurant kitchen I could, including the one at our hotel too- I have mild ocd, related to cleanliness, hygiene mainly) and I was genuinely thrilled to meet these lovely ladies whom were working at this great women's charity in order to better their lives.Lunch is served 12-3, almost daily, check their website (link above) and dinner bookings I believe can only be made for large parties of 20+. I am actually so thrilled with my experience there and having learnt about what they stand for, next time I'm in Morocco, I intend to book out the place for dinner and take some lovely local's I met this time round - this way I get to treat them as well as give my hard earned \u00a3's to a worthy charity.As well as other souvenirs, they sell apron's, tea towels and strong shopping bags - all of which I bought to support the charity. Very reasonably priced. If you go on holiday to Marrakech, I really think Amal is a must, you must visit. Not only are you supporting a amazing charity by spending your money here but the food - wow!! The food was absolutely delicious. What amazing quality and the desserts were to die for - just yummy! It is a shame we were only in Morocco for 4 days, I could easily go to eat lunch there everyday...and next time we go, that's just what I intend to do!A comment for the Amal team - Thank you for having us, please keep up the good work. May you prosper and do well in your aim to help and empower more local women. I'd love it if you also opened up for dinner. Yup you will certainly have my custom on a daily basis. I hope to return later this year, when it's cooler. Thank you for serving us, by far, the best meal I ate in your beautiful country."

The following week we made sure to come back for lunch and enjoyed seeing everyone again, meeting all of the other diners, and enjoying our delicious meals!We recommend the Amal Women's Traoining Center and Moroccan Restaurant to any and everyone who is visiting Marrakech whether it be for your first time or you've been to the city before!Thanks for a phenomenal time and if we're ever in Marrakech again you will definitely be seeing our family again!"

The restaurant/ cooking school is located in lovely neighbourhood in the new town, and so it was a great excuse to escape the hectic-tourist filled medina. Our teacher was very patient with us, and the young woman translating fun to chat to. The food (a beef and prune tajine) was delicious. I would love to go back to the restaurant to eat more. The whole atmosphere was very friendly, and this was definitely one of the highlights of our trip."

Taking a cooking class here was an excellent experience as the staff and trainees were extremely welcoming, hospitable and knowledgeable. Not only do you get to learn how to cook a traditional Moroccan dish, but you also learn about the Amal training program, and the women involved with the program. Not too mention the food you prepare is a delicious (and extremely filling) treat at the end of class. You get to eat in the beautiful courtyard, and feel like you are n your own Moroccan oasis. Definitely recommend a visit to Amal Women's Center."

This was a wonderful day (10am to 4pm) due to the attention and guidance from Gemma and Cecile and the wonderful dynamic experience of cooking alongside Morrocan women. the first hour or so was spent in the souks buying produce for our meal and this was both a great experience and educational, giving an insight into products that would be difficult to gain as a tourist passing through alone.We were a group of 12, the only two Brits in a group of Dutch and German, but great conversation and laughter was had throughout the day. The kitchen is in the -open-to-the-sky centre of a riad hidden away in the Medina and which provides an amazing experience. We even took some of our produce through the streets to a local baker to have it baked in his ovens.Between us all and with the insistent guidance of our local cooks, we created a feast of salads, fish, two types of briouates, cous cous and cookies. We then thoroughly enjoyed eating it all, washed down by some local wine. Thank you Gemma and to all the ladies in the kitchen."

It truly is an amazing experience from the people you will meet in the souks with Gemma, to the fresh ingredients, her sous chefs, and the actual making and eating of the meal. From start to finish it was a wonderful adventure. My 7 year old daughter loved being a mini-chef and walking the treats to be baked down at the baker. My oldest (15 years) and middle (12 years) love to cook at home, so to do it here themselves and enjoy new foods & fresh ingredients was a real treat. The souks are overwhelming at first when on your own. Gemma, the owner, teaches so much about the shops and how to navigate them. She introduces you to the people she regularly shops with. In the days following, they would recognize us and we would stop in for a visit. The information is priceless, as is the experience. Gemma and her sous chefs make this experience.Gemma is also very accommodating. We have a daughter with serious allergies that has to avoid many types of food. Gemma got the list of allergens ahead of time and made a complete menu from appetizers through desert that the whole family could enjoy. We never had to worry, which was a welcome relief from the rest of the trip since it was very challenging to make sure everything she ate was safe.Overall, it was the highlight of our trip. I think our kids will always remember the experience as well. Thank you all!"

What a wonderful experience though in the souks, with her help, we shopped as a couple getting ingredients for the meal we were about to cook. Once we had all of our ingredients we headed to her home where we met a Moroccan chef and her sous chef. We had the best time cooking vegetarian Moroccan dishes and then enjoyed them as a group with wine and tea. I was even able to walk the tray of biscuits to the local baker and returned an hour later to pick them up. Incredible experience! Gemma was wonderful as were the chefs.

I e mailed the owner, Gemma who responded within a couple of days, with all the info. I needed to make a booking. My husband (who considers beans on toast is a cookery challenge) and I were so pleased we had booked this very unique event. We met as per instructions, Gemma and one of her friends, and with 13 other eager cookery students visited the Souk. We were given a shopping list of ingredients needed to cook a typical meal. .The cooking was in a kitchen open to the sky. Tuition was given by experts, that is local women who use the recipes on a daily basis for their families. The ladies spoke very little English, however even if you don't speak French fluently, everyone understood the instructions given. Gemma was on hand at all times to supply the water and encouragement.After all was baked in ovens or cooked on the stove, we sat together and ate our delicious dishes and biscuits.This full day event has inspired my non-cooking husband to be more adventurous when taking the kitchen cooking challenge. I also picked up tips how to use spices and easy food preparation know - howsThis day was also a great way to meet others from all over the world- USA, Australia, Sweden, Austria, France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, (apologies if I've left anyone out).Don't forget your camera. Aprons are supplied so no worries about food splashes on clothes.Also a big thank you to Gemma for guiding us to find a taxi to return to our hotel. Without your help we would have easy lost our way."

After buying all necessary ingredients on the market, you will be welcomed into the home of a bunch of lovely Moroccan women who teach you how to make traditional Moroccan food such as Tajine, salads, dips, pastry, fish and meat and much much much more ... But be aware - you better strictly follow the recipe! ;)No where in Marrakech was the food - nor the company - that good!We are more than amazed and thankful that we had the chance to get to know the real Moroccan hospitality while eating such amazing food and learning sooooo much!Would recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech and will certainly come back on a second visit!Once again, a virtual thank you to our lovely host and guide Gemma! :)"

She gave great advice not only on food, but about the Moroccan way of life and how to get by in the craziness of the square. We walked, talked and shopped for an hour or so, filling our bags with the most beautiful of produce,fresh spices and the freshest chicken we have ever seen! After bartering with the locals we headed back to her kitchen ( which was amazing ) where we met our 2 chefs who would be guiding us along side Gemma to prepare our delicious lunch. We drank tea while the chefs prepared our ingredients then got to work cooking some of the most tasty fresh food we have ever experienced!We sat and ate tajines, veggies and all types of other delights, then talked over a herb infused tea which was nothing like we have had before.I cannot recommend this tour highly enough, it was one of the best ways to get to know the surrounds and an overall wonderful time that will be remembered forever.Thank you Gemma and the Souk Cuisine team!!"

This was an education in itself, especially the visit to the spice shop and buying chicken from the chicken and rabbit butcher! Once we'd bought our ingredients it was back to the Riad for refreshing lemon verbena tea and a break before the cooking started. A few reviews have said that they didn't really get to cook and they just prepped veg. Well, seeing as preparation is most of cooking, that is no surprise, but everyone in the class of 11 got stuck in and we all got to cook as well as prepare the dishes. Activities like this depend on participation and the more you put in the more you get out of it. The ladies who were our tutors for the day were great fun and showed us exactly what we needed to do, with Gemma overseeing and explaining in detail. Once the food was cooked we sat down to an amazingly delicious feast and we rolled out about 4.30pm. This was a great way to spend the day and as a bonus we made new friends too.

The shopping tour was also a good brush up of our French skills. Then we went to the riad which housed the kitchen and in the courtyard of a very pretty riad we prepared our lunch supervised by four lovely Marroccan ladies. Salads, tangines, chicken (baked at the local bakery - we had to carry the trays there and pick them up again) followed by mint tea and a variety of sweets. Sooo delicious and great fun.

We both had a lot of fun and learnt a few things along the way.The first thing I'd say is that I recommend doing this early in your trip. The souks can be a bit daunting and this is a great way to ease yourself into it. Having a guide who is explaining everything as you go along makes it a lot more interesting too.You start the day with your shopping list, bags, and a purse provided by Gemma. You then have to get all your ingredients (being directed of course). Thankfully food is a fixed price so you don't have to worry about haggling or being overcharged. I found the spice souk particularly interesting, being showed how to tell the difference between real and fake saffron.Once you have all your ingredients you head to the kitchen for tea and a sit down before the cooking starts. There are different stations and you will usually get one dish to cook at each station. This means that you probably only directly have a hand in one or two dishes, but you can watch the other stations to get an idea of how the other dishes are done (hint: there's a lot of chopping veg in Moroccan food). I think it works better that way because all the food is ready at the same time and it's not overwhelming. Gemma and her team of Moroccan ladies are always on hand to help.Once the main meals are cooking, the cookies are made and delivered to the local baker to be collected later.Everybody then sits down to eat. It's nice that Souk Cuisine caters for everybody's tastes and will adjust the menu accordingly.Overall I'd strongly recommend Gemma and Souk Cuisine. It makes a huge difference to the day going round the souks in the morning, it's far more than just a cooking class. That being said, if you want an advanced cooking class there might be better options, but if you want a fun day, a trip round the souks, to learn about the food and have a chance to make one or two dishes (and eat them of course!) then this is your best option.Thanks very much Gemma and her crew :)"

However, for anyone looking for a simple introduction to Moroccan food, a chance to explore the exciting (but somewhat daunting) markets with a guiding hand, and a welcome break from the hustle of the city then Souk cuisine is perfect. We cooked a mixture of cold salads and kefta tagine in a small peaceful riad and took marinated sardines and home-made biscuits to the local bakery. It was a really nice way to spend the afternoon to relax, meet some lovely people and of course, enjoy the delicious food. Overall a very pleasant way to spend the day in Marrakech- highly recommended!"

We had a very small group of 6. & we each got given a list of Ingredients we needed to purchase from the souls. As Gemma took us around she told us a lot of interesting information & mixing with the locals was really fun. We went back to where she lived & two Moroccan women who were Chiefs, helped us cook all our dishes. It was an extremely enjoyable experience & we each got given a little recipe book of the food we had made that we could take home with us. When it was all cooked we all sat down with wine & enjoyed the lovely food we had made. I would recommend this to anyone that hasn't tried a cooking class.I'd give this 6 stars if I could!!"

The shopping for the ingredients in the medina was very fun as was mixing with the locals, learning about Moroccan spices, and seeing the community bakery. We made mostly salads, and a tajine and some pastries all of which were excellent. The cooks are local Moroccan ladies who speak no English so this made for some fun sign language as we tried to follow the directions.

This offers exactly that. The group met in the main square and Gemma set us the task of shopping for the ingredients needed in the souks. The group consisted of 3 New Zealand girls, 2 Germans and us (2 Brits). We all bonded really quickly and with a shared task we all got down to business. After around an hour we found our way to Gemma's riad and after a short rest we cracked on with cooking. We were all set a task and helped by the two local ladies who were hard task masters, making sure everything was done properly. There were no real demos but it was easy to pick up what you needed to do and to join in with others when they were on task which interested you. Between us we made around 10 dishes and then once they were ready (we used the oven belonging to the local baker) we sat down to enjoy the fruits of our labour. This excursion was just what I hoped it to be, fun, informal, interesting and laid back. I'd 100% recommend it."

She has a great relationship with a lot of the shopkeepers who are excited to chat with us and educate us on their products. The shopping is followed by cooking the courses in her kitchen with two Moroccan dadas (cooks). Once all the food was cooked, we all sat down and enjoyed one of the best meals I had in Morocco.

Items to be baked are taken on the trays back into the Souk to the bakers where for a few dhiram we can use his oven.

I've always enjoyed Moroccan cooking and I even own a Tagine, so the opportunity to learn from the locals was perfect.The owner, a Dutch lady called Gemma, runs a well organised set-up that gives you a hands-on experience of buying, preparing and cooking Moroccan cuisine.We met at the Cafe de France on the edge of the Jemaa al-Fna square and after introductions and a brief run-down of the day's activities, our party of 4 was each given a shopping bag, shopping list and envelope of local money before heading of into the souk. We shopped for sardines, chicken, vegetables, bread and spices. The visit to the spice shop was particularly enjoyable as the young owner told us all about the medicinal properties of various spices and let us taste some too. The brightly coloured tubs of spice were amazing, and I'd never seen so much saffron in one place - and this was the real thing.Armed with our 'comestibles', we headed back to Gemma's riad, in one of the alleyways of the souk, where we met two women \"dadas\" (wedding and festival chefs), who were there to help with the preparation and pass on their knowledge to us.I prepared two dishes: Baked Sardines with Chermoula; and Chribas, a sweet biscuit. Other dishes were Moroccan Salad, Courgette Salad, Carrot Salad with Almonds and Raisins, Sweet Pumpkin Salad, Zaahlouk, Chicken with Chermoula, and Vegetable Tagine. We spent a couple of hours preparing the dishes and the those that needed cooking were taken to the local bakery.While the food was cooking, we sat together with a few glasses of wine eating snacks and chatting about the day we had. The whole day was rounded off with our home-cooked \"banquet\" and more wine.A wonderful day with a wonderfully generous host.

But it was exceptionally good. Came away with a recipe booklet and definitely intend to recreate some of the dishes at home.My one reservation with the day is that it might not be for you if you are looking for a cookery course type experience. The dishes were shared between the team and the amount and complexity of actual cooking depended on your role in the team. Probably more chopping than cooking but lots of fun all the same.For us it was a perfect experience as we were more interested in the food of Morrocco than improving our cooking skills.

Classes convene in the courtyard of an old riad, where budding chefs learn how to make dishes like lamb tagine and raisin couscous, culminating in a four-course lunch on the terrace, served with mint tea and wine (40 euros).\"They have apparently migrated from the courtyard of an old riad to the kitchen of a modest house. They have downsized from a four-course feast to a medley of salads and appetizers, and they have traded in the lamb couscous for processed sardines (really). We didn't so much cook as we chopped up some vegetables for some wonderful Moroccan women to season and cook for us - and as much as I appreciated their cooking, 90 euros seemed a lot to pay to play mommy's little kitchen helper and eat a meal that costs less than 5 euros to make.I should note, too, that the \"visit to the Rahba Kedima\" (2.5 hours) made me very uncomfortable. Our host played the role of expert on the locals while remaining complicit as members of the group took photos of people without asking for permission. It seemed as if half our tour consisted of vendors getting justifiably annoyed with close-ups they had never consented to and our gracious guide trying to persuade them to be photographed (\"Come on, just a few, for her...\"). The cultural insensitivity reached a peak when she joked that the group (in which I was the only man) was reminiscent of a harem, a comment I found especially inappropriate given my ethnicity.It seems that some of the one-star reviewers missed out on the experience. I envy them."

Traveling with our 16 year old daughter and her two friends, we wanted to have a fun experience with Moroccan cooking. I liked the Souk Cuisine package because it also involved food shopping in the souks beforehand. We met Gemma in the Jemaa el Fna Square and got right to work. The full group was 11, so we split into two subgroups to shop. Our family went with Gemma, armed with shopping bags, shopping lists and wallets with local currency. What a fun and educational experience we had! We visited the olive vendor, the preserved lemon vendor, the fruit and vegetable market, the bakery, the spice shop and more. Perhaps the craziest was when one of the girls agreed to choose the chickens, not realizing they would be live chickens. Fully loaded down, we headed to a local riad where there were metal tables set up for workspaces. We split up amongst the tables and worked on different parts of the meal. The other guests focused on making the vegetable and chicken tagines. Our group worked on the various vegetable salads. There were 3 or 4 Moroccan women helping out. Certainly there was a lot of chopping, but that is the nature of a lot of Moroccan cooking. Guests could help as much or as little as they chose, stopping for breaks to munch on olives and bread, and have a glass of the ubiquitous mint tea. I chopped a lot of tomatoes, parsley, cilantro, onion and carrots. The girls worked on courgettes, shredded cucumbers, squeezing oranges and slicing eggplants. My daughter spent a lot of time frying all the eggplants, so much so that she and her friends came up with an eggplant frying dance. When all the food was done we made our way to the rooftop and enjoyed a leisurely meal. Since returning home I have already recreated the eggplant dish (which will taste better when tomatoes come in season). I\u2019ll even try a tagine soon, although I am a bit \u201ctagined out\u201d. This was probably one of our favorite activities and I would definitely recommend it."

I reviewed several cooking class options in Marrakech and Souk stuck out because it seemed like a more authentic experience (smaller groups, included shopping in the market and wasn't at a Western hotel). Gemma (who founded and owns the company) met us in the morning, gave out shopping lists & money and took us into the market to buy all the ingredients for our multi-course lunch. This was my favorite part and where I learned most about Moroccan culture. Gemma does an excellent job of explaining how Moroccans live their lives as you make your way through the various alleys and squares. For example, I would never have known that in each area's bakery, its common for Moroccans to bring in their own dough or anything else they want to cook in the wood burning oven (we took our chicken and sardines there to cook while we prepared other dishes). After everything on our list was checked off, we headed back to her Riad where Souk is on the ground floor and where sunlight poured into the kitchen from an open roof. We each took a station and began preparing the many dishes we were excited to eat. Two Moroccan women were there to step in for anyone needing extra help. Since we had informed her that my boyfriend was vegetarian prior to the trip, she ensured that there were plenty of options for him. When all was done, we sat down to the most delicious meal I had in Morocco and Gemma was generous with wine and company. She went out of her way to accommodate us and I would recommend this as a must-do to anyone I knew heading to Marrakech. Truly wonderful and enriching experience."

Best of all, we marched our trays to the local communal wood-fired oven and 30 min later retrieved pans of perfectly cooked fish - all on the honor system with the guys who run the bakery. Totally charming & unexpected. Best of all, we sat down a few hours later on a sunny terrace to share the meal with a dozen new acquaintances from all over the world who we'd shared a lot of laughs with over the day.

We all met Gemma in the Djemma el Fna square where we then split into groups and armed with a shopping list, headed into the souks to buy the day's ingredients. We were (thankfully!) accompanied by Gemma who helped us work out which were the best ingredients as well as explaining all the various culinary curiosities which we passed along the way. Shopping done, we then headed to the Riad where we were to start our cooking course which was very conveniently situated at around 2 mins walk from where we were. We were warmly welcomed into the immaculate Riad where tables and cooking equipment had been laid out in preparation. We had some mint tea as recipe books were distributed in our various languages so that we could preview what we were about to cook. Dividing into groups and each making different things (around 11 dishes in total including a range of traditional salads, a tagine and dessert), we spent a very pleasurable couple of hours under the watchful eye and guidance of the very friendly Morroccan cooks. At any time, we were free to sit back down and relax with some bread, olives and tea/water or go up to the roof terrace. We all rotated and Gemma encouraged us to have a go at making different dishes before we all went upstairs to the sunny roof terrace to eat our creations with wine and good conversation. Gemma made a point of talking personally to every person and the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. We are keen to try to recreate these meals at home using the recipe book and cannot recommend this highly enough."

We haggled for olives, sardines, fruits, and vegetables under her watchful eye, and found areas of the souks that we had completely missed in our prior wanderings. We learned that a \"supermarket\" is a small shop that looks like many of the other souks, and that her local neighborhood grocery store was a small 3 ft x 3 ft window in the wall where the shop owner handed out what she wanted after knocking for it to open. We returned to a lovely Riad where the open-air lobby was completely outfitted with worktables, equipment, and helpful staff. She provided each of us with a cookbook, and we set to work making the most wonderful meal you can imagine. Every detail had been carefully considered, so that we and the other participants could participate as much as we wanted, but her staff was there to help as needed so that we completed the meal in a timely (and delicious) fashion.

This was a fascinating experience in itself that would not have been possible without such a guide. It was two hours of shopping before we arrived with our \"loot\" at the Riad where we were to have our lesson. There were fully equiped work stations for all of us and stoves in the sunny courtyard of the Riad There were two Moroccan women who, with Gemma, guided us in the preparation - which we did ourselves - of several cooked salads starters with three main courses and lovely light as air cookies for dessert. About 2 1/2 hours later,we all went up to the roof top dining area to enjoy our feast. Gemma provided wine and by the end we had enjoyed four bottles of excellent Moroccan rose.

This was all very easy to do via email before you arrive. You start the day in the main square where it was very easy to meet everyone, before being taken into the souks armed with your shopping list, purses and bags (all included in the cost of the trip so you don't need to bring lots of change!)The group was broken down into 2 smaller groups so it was very easy to hear our guide and you didn't feel too on show in the markets (although you obviously still are!). I hadn't realised before this that you don't haggle for food in the markets so this makes the experience much easier and enjoyable and you can spend the time really finding out about the foods and where it comes from. The shopping takes approximately 2 hours but it is really good fun and you learn as you go, as well as seeing different areas of the souk. After picking up some bread (fresh from the bakers oven!) You then go to the Riad to start the course. The only downside I would say is that you don't each make every single dish as you do on some courses, but this does mean that the group is able to make more as it is shared across more people. You each get a recipe book to take away with you and you're split up to cover separate dishes, however you can happily walk between the different tables to pick up tips as you go. The local ladies who help you are quite strict so be prepared to follow sharp instructions, but the outcome is definitely worth it!You end the day with lunch on the roof terrace (weather allowing) and a few glasses of wine. A really worthwhile day and a fun excursion as part of a quick city break!"

I always take a cooking class while traveling abroad, because this is the best way to learn about another culture. Since my mom doesn't speak English very well and Gemma, the owner, is Dutch this was a perfect option for us. We were met at the Jemaa el Fna with shopping bags and lists of the stuff that we had to buy in the Souk. I've done more cooking classes, but none where you actually buy your ingredients yourself on the local market. Great experience and great fun. We had a small group of six, so after shopping and learning about the ingredients we went to Gemma's house, in the middle of the Souk. There two helpers waited for us and started prepping the food, while we enjoyed some tea or drinks. After that, it was hands on and start cooking. Chopping large amounts of fresh herbs, vegetables, onions, garlic, etc. We made a perfect meatball tagine with egg and had so much fun mixing the meat mixture, making meatballs and a lot more. After that, we also had to make typical Morrocan biscuits for desert, so more opportunities to get our hands dirty. After all the cooking was done, Gemma set the table and we all enjoyed a perfectly cooked lunch that was more than enough to last us for dinner as well. It was by far the best food I've had while I was in Marrakesh and when I go back to this beautifull city, I will certainly take another cooking class at Souk Cuisine."

We loved the tour of the Souk, which is great as you can feel intimidated as girls in Marrakech. Gemma was totally aware and catered to our dietary requirements and we ended up making an amazing fish tagine after a series of salads. I totally recommend this class and as 45 euros, is definitely a great price!"

This was invaluable as initally walking around the Souks was quite intimidating so I felt more comfortable being able to stop and look at things properly. Gemma was really helpful and was able to give a lot of local knowledge and she even took us to a local communal bread oven which was great. She explained what some of the Morrocan delicacies were which from looking at some of these alone we would never have known!The cooking course itself was excellent. We were welcomed into Gemma's beautiful Riad where we cooked several Morrocan dishes and were given a recipe booklet to take with us too to try at home.The course was approx 5 hours which was a perfect amount of time. We were not rushed around the Souks and Gemma was extremely patient with all our questions! She even assisted in us purchasing some herbs and spices to take home with us.I would highly recommend this course. It was nice and relaxed and informal and I will definately try and cook some of these recipes at home."

Marrakech offers several options for cooking classes, but I don't think any of them offer an experience such of this.We met Gemma in the main square (Jemaa el Fna) without any trouble, and we immediately started on our journey shopping in the souk for our ingredients. As we walked through the markets (which Gemma navigated with ease), she taught us not only where to purchase our ingredients, but also where to purchase the best items that were of interested to us (i.e. fabric) and where/what to eat. There will be no need for you to purchase a souk tour is you book this cooking class. It's a souk tour and cooking class all in one!Now on to the cooking, the riad kitchen is small, but comfortable. Aisha and the other cook whose name escapes me greeted us with lovely smiles. Although they did not speak English, Gemma translated and they were super friendly, laughing and joking with us. My group had a wide range of cooking levels, and we all loved this. We each focused on different dishes and we all loved the experience. The zaalouk is something all of us still talk about!OH! I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about my experience in booking the class. Gemma was very responsive and provided me all the information I need. She even catered to my requests for a private class and a specific menu. We all left with smalls on our faces and some wonderful recipe books. This is a must-do in Marrakech. :)"

We were two friends travelling, and our Souk Cuisine cooking class had just 2 other participants so we were a small group of 4 + Gemma. The 2 others were an Aussie couple about our age, so it was great chatting with them during shopping and cooking to get to know them better.I deliberately selected Souk Cuisine because I wanted the experience of shopping for ingredients in the market, and I'm so glad I did, because I really would have felt that we would have missed out on a critical part of the cooking process! We each had a shopping list and a coin purse with a little money and Gemma took us around to her preferred vendors in the souks to purchase the ingredients. Shopping took about 2 hours.Because we were a small group, instead of cooking in a riad I believe we cooked in the downstairs kitchen of Gemma's home. There was plenty of space and natural sunlight from the open courtyard, but it was lovely to be out of the heat. Others have mentioned that due to the (large) size of their groups they were each isolated to individual tasks and didn't get to learn how to make the other dishes. However, given the small size of our group, we each divided up the dishes and were responsible for a set of dishes, but during the preparation there was enough downtime (while waiting for things to cook, pans to heat up, etc) that it was quite easy to keep an eye on / ask questions of / watch the others in the group to see what they were working on!We cooked for about 2 hours, then sat down to enjoy our lunch. I was so glad that Gemma chose some unique dishes -- instead of typical tagines and couscous, we had a really special dish (\"seffa\") involving buttered steamed vermicelli noodles and a hidden stewed/curried chicken surprise \"buried\" in the middle. All in all - my friend and I agreed that this was the highlight of our 5 days in Morocco."

About an hour's guided shopping in the Souk followed with a shopping list, bag and money wallet in hand. Everything was clearly explained by Gemma, and we bartered with the stall holders for produce under her very welcome guidance.With all the ingredients bought we went back to her riad to prepare a series of delicious dishes. This is very much a team activity, supported by two experienced sous chefs. Drinks were provided throughout.I'm quite an experienced amateur cook, but picked up several new ideas and techniques on the day. Can't wait to try these at home.Lunch was delicious and of course consisted of the fruits of our collective efforts.Excellent value for money and a fantastic day out. Thanks Gemma."

We met Gemma (the Dutch lady who operates the course and resident in Marrakech for about 5 years) met us and 4 other participants at 10 am and then proceeded to take us round the local markets - armed with 2 x purses, 2 x shopping list and shopping baskets. Under her guidance we had to source and purchase the ingredients for our meals and this was great fun. She gave us a lot of local knowledge and showed us markets we hadn't found before ! After visits to spice shops, fishmonger, veg markets, bakery etc etc (which all in all took us about 1.5/2 hrs we then went on to her beautiful home right in the heart of the medina. Six preparation places were laid out in her courtyard kitchen (with sun streaming down from the roof terrace !) and under the guidance of her lovely Moroccan cook (whose recipes we followed) we prepared an abundance of great dishes - various veg salads (carrot, aubergine, cucumber, courgettes, etc etc) with monkfish tagine and briouettes (like little samosas) with fish & vermicelli filling). Also some little cakes were make (shortbread type) which were delicious !!! We all had a hand in the various dishes - and finally sat down to a lovely meal with wine and/or water !All the food was exceptionally tasty and delicious - and we all felt very proud of our achievements as the whole experience was very \"hands on\" with only guidance from our hosts !We took so many photos and I will post some on this site (when I get round to downloading them from my camera as only got back 2 days ago!). We would thoroughly recommend Souk Cuisine to anybody interested in experiencing traditional Moroccan cooking - we did it all !! I have since tried one or two of the dishes we prepared with great success (we all had a booklet with the recipes).Well done Gemma - and thanks for a great experience !"

I'm not a person who 'enjoys' cooking, it's usually just something that has to happen so that I can eat decent meals, but my better half certainly does enjoy it, and so I booked us onto Gemma's cookery day. I booked it for the first day we had in Marrakech, as I figured that being guided around the souks to collect the ingredients would be a slightly gentler introduction to the place than just plunging headlong into the madness.And I was right. Having Gemma discuss the pros and cons of the souks, and how to deal with the market holders and give guidelines on prices of foods was the perfect way to overcome some of the culture shock of a first time visitor to Morocco. Plus, most of the stallholders must have recognised the colourful shopping bags we had and realised we were on the 'Souk Cuisine' gathering walk though the stalls. One herb stallholder even referred to Gemma as 'Madame Plastique' as she would be a frequent visitor with her colourful plastic bags and collection of tourists in tow.The actual gathering, preparing, cooking and eating was brilliantly managed and I think everyone in our rather large group felt really at ease with the day. The preparation and cooking took place in the courtyard of a Riad which was a lovely little area, and then the eating took place upstairs on the terrace in the sun. For a day in the middle of winter it was just perfect; nice food, interesting conversation with a mix of nationalities and glorious sunshine!"

The Moroccon lady who helped us out did not interact very much and it was up to me to ask her questions about what we were doing. It's a shame we didn't get to cook more dishes and see how other dishes are prepared.

My daughter & I booked on this course which took out one day of a 3 day trip, but we felt it would be worth it as the course received good reviews & having done previous courses in Thailand we were expecting great things. Sadly that was not the case. The biggest issue was that they seemed to overpack the course with 15 people (didn't like the fact that they lied about the large number either. They said some people from the hotel wanted to join & as we were using their premises it was unfair to say no. But none of the people were actually staying there, so it was a bit of a cover up to get as much money as they could, in my opinion).Having so many people made the trip around the market painful. It took over 2 hours & we seemed to spend forever waiting around for someone who had wandered off. I had lost the will to live before we even got to the kitchen!.On previous courses the prep is done & you learn how to cook the recipes. Not the case here - I felt like a sous chef. All we did was prepare vegetables! I had to chop over 15 onions & a poor girl that was on the course had to peel about 100 tomatoes bless her! What are you learning about Moroccan cookery from that? The Moroccan ladies were also stressed & grumpy. They were not at all welcoming or friendly & made you feel like a YTS student & kept saying 'chop more, chop more'!! They were very unpleasant tutting & shaking their heads - what was all that about I am on holiday for goodness sake, not in catering! I wanted to learn how to make the chicken & lemon tagine but they took it off into the kitchen & produced it when it was cooked so I haven't got a clue how they did that.The food at the end was delicious & it was nice to eat it on the roof top terrace, but because of the number it massively ran over & we were rushed & couldn't eat our meal as we had transport arranged back.It is a real shame as this course has great potential, but they need to make some fundemental changes. They really need to limit the number strictly. With 15 in the kitchen & pans of bolining oil it is an accident waiting to happen. Also the tap was overflowing & a marble floor was swimming in water & very dangerous (but then health & safety simply doesn't seem to be an issue here!)."

It felt like they had just crammed in extra people to make more money and we all suffered as a result. The tour of the souks is very good and most enjoyable. We then went to a Riad to supposedly learn to cook. In fact there were so many of us that we were each given the job of chopping and preparing 1 or 2 vegetables whilst the Moroccan ladies did the cooking. They were the only unhappy looking people I meet during our 6 days in Marrakesh. They seemed very stressed and did not show us anything. If we tried to ask we got no where. I did not learn anything new at all about how to cook. The meal was served on the terrace and was excellent. We were only given 2 bottles of wine for 15. Eventually a third one did arrive. The other guests were great fun. It was a very good tour of the souks and lunch. It was not a cooking course. If you want to learn to cook I don\u2019t think this day is for you. We learnt more about cooking on the Berber Tours trip (which was brilliant)."

This cooking day is superb and even if you are only there for a few days we reccomend this as an unmissable thing to do. You don\u00b4t need to be a master chef, I certainly am not!What I would say is its not just a cooking course, You start off in the BIG SQUARE and are each given tasks, 2 people have shopping lists, 2 people money and 2 people shopping bags and you go into the souks to buy the ingredients and learn, it gives you a great insight into negotiating the souks and places to shop. Then you go back to the riad and cook and eat, we had a superb day and after returned to some of the shops and took home delicious spices and the best chilli sauce known.For xmas I gave friends spices and some of the recipees we learnt and new years eve we had a morrocan evening where we cooked what we had learnt for friends.I bought a Tagine and now cook on my terrace on my gas bbq morrocan delightsBook now, its a superb Day!!!"

Our day with Souk Cuisine was a great value, especially when you consider $50 per person paid for a whole day of instruction(10am to 3:30/4pm). Spending the am in the Souk (market) to buy ingredients meant learning a few key Arabic words, learning Souk etiquette (don't over handle the produce!!!), being invited behind the counters of several small shops, briefly meeting your entree (chickens) just before they went under the knife, and getting an indepth guide to dramatic piles of aromatic spices. It was a great indoctrination into Moroccan culture while sharing the experience with a small group of tourists from places arund the globe. Very interesting! Gemma and the other cook who worked with us (sorry I forgot her name) did an amazing job guiding us and accommodating our various cooking abilities and different needs (vegetarians). I'm glad we booked the Souk Cuisine for the beginning of our stay in Morocco, because we felt so much more comfortable and capable shopping in the Souk during the rest of our stay. My husband and I both considered this a highlight of our visit! And we'd do it again, and again! Did I mention the beautiful sunlit kitchen Gemma uses that is situated in the central courtyard. Kitchens in Morocco aren't usually I believe placed int he cental courtyard, but its location made the experience very special and makes sense for Gemma who receives her clients/cooks in a kitchen. Book ahead-or you may miss out on a fantastic day!"

We found Gemma to be totally professional, she was attentive to her clients without being overbearing, had an excellent rapport with local stall holders, had planned the day well for the number of clients and was very good company too.Our group comprised 5 or 6 different nationalities, ranging in age from early 20's to late 50's and with various dietary needs and yet everyone really enjoyed the experience.The shopping trip was a highlight for me, we went in small groups to purchase herbs,veg, spices,chicken, fish, bread etc. Normally I hate organised activities and would sooner die than go on a tour or have a guide BUT some of these stalls I would never have even noticed if I had been on my own, especially the bakery which was a huge clay oven where local residents were taking their food to be cooked, ladies with sesame seeds to toast or bread to bake. The bread came straight out of the oven in to our bag!Buying the chicken live was a new experience!!! Maybe one I will not repeat!!As others have said, this is not a highly technical class or a master class, it is a superb day out in excellent company, the meal we cooked was the best food we had in Marrakech and we now have recipes that we will use over and over. I would highly recommend Souk Cuisine."

All in all good fun, very enlightening and also great value."

Interesting, sociable, entertaining, delicious, calming and educational are the best words to describe our day. As I'm sure you've already heard from previous reviews, we spent the first part of the day in the markets buying the ingredients for our meal. Led by Remi, we learnt many extraordinary things about the markets that would ordinarily escape most tourists. The experience proved to be a more relaxed way to investigate these usually daunting souks by having a guide.When we returned to the riad just a short stroll from the square, we were given a small book of recipes in our own language and each one was explained. After choosing which preparation station to work at, we all happily got on prearing our dishes under the watchful eye of Aisha and Remi. Everything was very well organised and where time was tight, Aisha stepped in to assist. Several hours later after busily chopping, frying, folding etc the food went into the ovens and dishes and lunch was served. I can only say that it was the best meal we had during our stay in Marrakech (not just because we cooked it).Overall a brilliant day. Ignore negative comments from previous reviews, they must be from petty-minded people who lack the ability to socailly assess different situations and people."

The 13 of us where split in 2 groups given a shopping list, a bag and some money. We were in the group with Gemma and she provided great advise what to look out for when buying the ingredients. I am very sure that you have never done this kind of food shopping living in North America or Europe. Unlike anything else you buy here in Marakesh you do not have to discuss the price but you sure discuss the quality of the product :-)COOKING:Gemma led us to a nice riad where a few tables where set up waiting for us to cut our the produce we just had purchased. So after a good rinse the cutting started. We were split up in groups again according to the recipes that were provide: Moroccan salads, tagine, couscous, cookies as desert. Gemma with the help of 3 Moroccan ladies made sure we cut everything the \"right\" way and we used the right herbs to make it all perfect. The smell and colors was unbelievable!EATING:In the end we got to eat all our new creations - I must say - this was better than in any restaurant I have been to in Marrakesh. This must have been the fluffiest and moistest couscous I have ever eaten! Every thing was just great. We can highly recommend this cooking class. Even my husband, who is not to interested in cooking had a great time. We published a few picture under flickr, key word: Gemma van de burgt, souk cuisine."

            "review": "A Very Interesting Culinary Experience.. I feel I must defend Ms. Gemma Van De Burght. My partner and I attended Souk Cuisine for a day last month, and found it a really enjoyable experience. Gemma is a very well-organised, efficent lady and is of a fairly quiet disposition. She has a limited amount of time to have clients prepare and cook ingredients, and I'm positive she has all planned very precisely - she's been doing this for a few years and her ways work for her. It was quite a serene experience, and we all were allocated different tasks as there'd not be enough hours in the day for one-to-one tutoring. If you want that, it'd be exorbitant - it's just a \"taster\" ( pardon the pun ) of what Moroccan cooking is about, we didn't expect to emerge experts. To be honest, we've been to Morocco several times and eat French, Italian and Chinese food when there as we don't particularily like Moroccan food, but we went to Gemma's course with open minds, willing to sample all the food, and we did. It was a relaxing day away from the madness just outside in the markets, and my partner and I always appreciate being able to enter other people's houses when abroad, simply to enjoy the difference in how others live. No-one yet has mentioned the most magical thing : the house has a pair of resident sparrows who flit about the courtyard ( i.e. kitchen ) and who nest and bring up young there every year. We think it was a lovely day, and well-worth the money, just to do something a little bit out-of-the-ordinary. By the way, we asked if we might take a few photos rather than just assuming this was acceptable, and were granted permission graciously."

            "review": "Great food, not great class. As part of our culinary tour of Morocco, we wanted to learn a bit more about Moroccan cuisine, and so decided to take some cooking classes. This was the second one we took, and the menu was far more ambitious than the introductory class we had taken earlier in the week. I should note also that I am a very experienced cook, and unlike another reviewer, found myself nearly alone in the over-40 demographic.As mentioned before, we met up and did the shopping in the souks, which for me was the best part of the class. It should be noted that the owner who usually leads the class was out sick, and another woman was filling in for her, so she may not have been entirely up to speed on everything. For example, we spent an entertaining half hour in a spice shop, where the shopkeeper put on a great show and explained many things, but then it turned out that there were no spices on our shopping list! There was also no explanation as to why we chose one merchant over another, which would have been useful information for when we ventured out on our own. The class itself was held in a tiny riad in the souks, which meant it was a tiny space, with very little elbow room. In my case, I had to weave my way around several people to the only sink every time I wanted to wash my hands, something you do frequently when cooking. There was also a lack of hot water and soap, which made it very hard to get olive oil and butter off my hands. Knives were of excellent quality, but not as sharp as they could have been. Organizationally speaking, the class has several issues: we were six students; there were six workstations. What was not clear was that by choosing your workstation (some were higher than other, I am tall, I chose based on height), you chose the dish (or dishes) you would be working on. No overview, just trying to guess the dish you had \u201cchosen\u201d by comparing the pile of recipes thrust into your hands with the ingredients in front of you. Our side of the room ended up spending over an hour peeling tomatoes, coring carrots and chopping zuchinni, while the people across the room were whipping up spicy sauces and marinades, working with chicken and fish and exotic ingredients. The cook spoke very little French, and none of us spoke Arabic, so it was not always easy to communicate. And we had to ask for nearly everything we needed: dishes, plates, pots, matches, oil, missing ingredients, etc. There was no demonstration: you were simply to follow the printed recipe given to you. And the recipes weren\u2019t that well written. Which meant that any time anyone didn\u2019t do something right, the cook would gruffly grab it out of their hands and do it for them. I would have liked a bit more explanation of what was going on: an overview of the menu, the structure of the class, certain techniques. For example, what is the advantage of steaming vermicelli over boiling it? Also, having different people do different dishes\u2014and having the cook do so much on her own without explanation\u2014meant that none of us had an overview: I personally never saw the chicken between the market and my dinner plate.Once the main dishes were cooking, we could relax a bit and work together making cookies and rolling pastries; by this time we had bonded like schoolchildren who had been chided for their behavior all too often. We had no problem with taking pictures, and indeed, everyone did it.In the end, we did have a fantastic meal: several salads, a hearty appetizer and a main dish that leaft us groaning (we barely touched it, we were so full). An excellent wine was offered with the meal. And we still had cookies to eat and take home. But I had a bitter taste in my mouth from our treatment at the hands of a grumpy cook."

I start with the good things:- shopping in the souks was very interesting, we've seen things I wouldn't see if walking alone,- the food we made was delicious! - the lady working for Gemma, Aisha, was very good at what she was doing, and showed us many small tricks to ease our work in the kitchen.Now things I hated:- I'm 32, which made me 20 years younger then the next person, and a target for Gemma's patronizing. Each time she saw me using my camera she would jump me and remind me not to take photos of people. As if it was my first time abroad, and as if I was at all interested in taking photos of someone!- when we arrived at the kitchen, I took out my camcorder, placed it in a corner standing on a tripod, pointed it at the exact spot I was standing in order to be able to film myself making food, and let it stand turned off while Gemma was explaining things. This made her go totally bananas!!! At first she tried to make the other clients (all Europeans) to admit they minded it, but of course they didn't. Then she exploded, screaming how abused she feels! I could understand this reaction if I was actually filming her, or somebody else, but I wasn't! I was going to film myself only, and I was going to start filming after she stopped talking. I mean, I'm an adult, and a lawyer, and I know it is against the law to film people without their consent! But the lady was behaving like crazy! I had to put away my camera, and I don't have a single photo or film from the whole day! If I wasn't there with someone, I'd probably just walked out the door, feeling abused myself! But the whole episode made me feel so angry it totally spoiled the day! That is the reason I do not recommended this cookery school - you do make good food, but if you're under 50, you're treated as a naughty child!"

It was also the best way to get a proper introduction to the souks (the markets) and not just feel like a harassed tourist! Gemma, the dutch woman who runs Souk Cuisine, took us around the souks not only to get us to pick up the groceries ourselves (very fun indeed!) but also to explain some of the ins and outs of Moroccan cuisine and market life - she finally explained to us what all those wierd and wonderful things we'd seen were (argan oil, preserved lemons, rancid butter, black soap, amlou - a paste not so different from peanut butter made from nuts and honey), and helped us to communicate when things got tricky (it did actually take us a good 2 hours to get the shopping done, most of it because of trying to ask someone for 500 grams of flour when you have no language in common!). After all that, with the help of a shy but stern Moroccan woman, we got to cooking in a gorgeous courtyard of a traditional home right around the corner from the spice market. We ended up after a few hours with an amazing meal of moroccan tomato salad, carrot salad (the best!), a smoky eggplant dip, a mini moroccan version of a samosa filled with prawns, vermicelli and calamari, a swordfish tagine, and if you can imagine there was any space left, sesame cookies as well. I have to say, I think it was one of the most impressive and delicious meals we had during our stay! I would highly recommend this not only to people who love food and cooking like we do, but also to anyone simply looking to do something a bit off the tourist track, if you want a little peek into traditional Moroccan culture, meet other like minded would-be cooks and learn something that you can take back with you as a great reminder of your trip!

We were collected promptly at 09.30 from our riad for our day of morrocan cookery at Atelier de cuisine...prior to making the booking I did a considerable amount of research as to which would be the right course for our group...this was part of my 50th birthday celebrations so I had booked for 10 of us ( sadly 2 of the group were unwell and didn't make it) The reason I chose this course was the fact that it took place at an organic farm in a Berber village approximately 35 mins outside of Marrakech...and also for the content of the course, it covered so many different elements!!We were greeted at the entrance by Chef Tarik and taken to a beautiful spot in the gardens to drink tea together...this was so humbling! then shown how to make this amazing traditional tea and given some history behind its meaning.After tea we donned our aprons and hats for a tour of the stunning vegetable gardens, and were then shown to our cooking stations ( all outdoors in the gardens) we had two chef's one at each station and we all participated in preparing three different targines, cous cous and three morrocan salad starters...which was very informative and great fun too.Whilst the food was cooking we went over the outside bread oven where one of the local ladies baked fresh bread that was served with homemade olive oil and fresh goats cheese....utterly delicious.This was followed by a short walk around the Berber village...a wonderful experience to really see how the locals live.Upon our return all of the salads and targines we had prepared earlier were served to us in a beautiful tent...the food was incredible, probably one of the best meals you will eat in Marrakech...along with a lovely tasty beetroot juice.This was followed by a delicious dessert...I was concerned that the left over food would go to waste but was reassured it would all be eaten by the staff and shared with the locals too.Chef Tarik organised a beautiful birthday cake with sparklers and all the team singing happy birthday to finish up our feast.....We then returned to garden for more tea and our certificates.I can only begin to tell you what a truly amazing day this was...we had an absolute ball...it was informative, fun, humbling, educational and full of delicious food, what more could you want?! oh yes and set in the most beautiful gardens too!!One of my friends said it will go down in her top five things she has ever done!! I totally agree...I would recommend this special day to everyone!!!"

Myself and three others went to Atelier De Cuisine Chef Tarik Orty-Ct during a five day trip to Marrakech and this was hands down our best experience of our visit. Throughout the day there are various workshops including tea-making with the 'tea master', a spice workshop, a look at the making of traditional Berber bread and then the actual practical cooking portion of the day. We made several tangines and three types of salad which we then ate in a beautiful tent in the garden/farm. We also had the chance to walk around the village which is beautiful and has amazing views of the city and the Atlas mountains. The staff really do go out of their way to welcome you and to create a relaxing and pleasant atmosphere. Chef Youssef was absolutely amazing - he was very friendly and is an extremely talented and skilled chef. One of the members of our party is vegetarian and another is vegan and the staff were very accommodating to this - Chef Youssef even made a vegan cake which is the first time he ever attempted it (it was really delicious!).As you can probably tell I really can't rate this place enough! You need to experience it to really understand how wonderful this establishment is. On our return to the city we spent the car journey discussing how enjoyable the day was and how we would definitely return to do another class when we return to the wonderful country of Morocco."

For people who are really Interested in cooking, who appreciate organic produce and who are interested in getting a glimpse into Moroccan traditions then this is the place to do your cooking course at. What I found particularly great and what differentiates this place from other places is that you cook 3 different ( not just one!) tajines, 3 salads and couscous. Chef Joussef was lovely and patient, and although the other people who were supposed to be on that course change their date they still did the course for just me instead of cancelling on me which I greatly appreciate.You even pick your own fresh organic veggies right off the garden.I can highly recommend this course and want to thank you again for this wonderful experience!"

The staff were amazingly accommodating particularly Hazam the village tea maker. It was a great experience and found the skills that we learnt are still being used at home today. We enjoyed picking the vegetables from the garden for our tajines.The driver conveniently picked us up from our accommodation and drove us the 45 minute trip to the village. It was such an authentic Moroccan setting, a bio organic farm in a local village nestled withing the desert. Upon our arrival, we were given a tour of the farm and an outline of the days activities. We soon began our spice lesson then were taught how to brew an authentic Moroccan mint tea, the best we had during our whole trip. We were impressed to learn that we had our own private chef/tutor, for the whole day. He was a lovely man with a great sense of humour and a lot of knowledge and skills. From there, we were escorted to the farm where we picked fresh produce to use in our dishes. We made three tajines and three salads and even learnt some unique skills for garnishing. While our dishes were slowing cooking on the hot coal fires, we were taken for a walk around the village where we got to experience first hand the simplicity of life lived in the local area. It was very calming to be away from the business of the city for the day. On our arrival back to the farm, the dishes we had made were eloquently presented to us in a traditional dining area. We were so proud of what we had made, it truly tasted like authentic Moroccan cuisine. We would recommend this cooking class to anyone interested in learning how to cook Moroccan food. It was one of the most enjoyable experiences during our whole holiday. A perfect surprise that we accidental stumbled upon. Do yourself a favour and give it a go :)"

Chaf Tarik and his staff made it easy for us to learn about the Moroccan cruise we had been enjoying on our trip to Morocco. We found this to be a nice change from souks, medinas and architecture! We chopped and stirred as we learned which spices are traditional for of the Tajines we made. We saw how the pots sit on coals to slow cook the delicious stews. We learned that the knob on the top of the Tajine pot does not get too hot to touch. We learned to make a few of our favorite Moroccan vegetable salads. We enjoyed eating what we had made for our lunch. The organic gardens at the school are lovely. While our Tajines cooked we walked through the neighborhood around the school and saw up close the traditional mud brick buildings, this walk provide a nice glimpse of local traditional life. Chef Tarik followed up with us after the class by emailing their recipes to us so we can make the Tajines at home and share our love of Moroccan food with our family and friends. Thank you everyone at the school for a really fun experience! A bonus is the clean restrooms!This is a really great activity and recommend it to anyone, it is just a short ride from Marrakesh!"

We were welcomed by chef Tarik, chef Youssouf and teamaker Hassan in a beautiful garden outside of Marrakech (30 min - pick-up included - we were picked up at 9.30 and brought back around 15.00h). Moroccan cuisine is typically slow food. Everything is prepared with a lot of love and attention, from the tea, to the selection of herbs to the salads and tajines and the bread. Because of the slow pace and the beautiful surrounding of the garden, we experienced the cooking class as a very relaxing activity (though of course we were put to work by the chefs;-)).

A winding drive 30km away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech, lies Chef Tarik's organic farm.Behind the tall gates, lies an oasis. Nestled in the dappled shade of olive trees grow neat little lines of beetroot, artichoke, carrots, eggplants, courgettes, herbs and more... But for Chef Tarik, it's about far more than just about growing fresh organic produce. The farm employees locals from the village, providing them with not only a source of income but also hospitality and catering training, whilst also introducing tourists to the history and cultures surrounding Moroccan food and tea. The day began learning about the ceremony of tea making - the making of which is just as important as the drinking! Our group was just four people, so we were introduced to Chef Tarik and his lovely team and learnt what the day had in store. Next up was a crash course in spices. The base to all tagines: salt, pepper, olive oil. Then just add other specific spices to create bases for different meats, vegetables and so ons. Then on to the cooking, three tagines and many salads to accompany them. The pace was great - never rushing but also not slow enough to allow us to get bored. We then moved on to the bread oven, where a local Berber woman was cooking fresh loaves for us to try (accompanied by goats cheese and olive oil, yum!). After a wander around the tiny village it was time for lunch. And what a feast... The highlight was definitely the lamb tagine with apricots and almonds, as well as the smoky eggplant salad. As a Muslim country there's no alcohol served; their wine comes in the form of a home grown beetroot and apple juice which was divine. And then came dessert - bananas baked in the fire with a spiced syrup and a yoghurt and orange jelly pot. We were easily defeated by the mountains of food, but the leftovers are distributed amongst staff and local families so rest assured nothing goes to waste here. Then it was time once again for tea - the same pot brewed three hours earlier only this time with added thyme to act as a digestif. Chef Tarik's organic oasis is the perfect remedy to the crazy city of Marrakech; food to feed the heart and soul... We learnt so much more than just how to cook. Thank you Tarik and team!"

He shared the nuances of handling a tagine and we did not have to worry about the writing of recipes as he e-mailed them later and we could focus only on how he was doing things.We made 3 tagines and 3 salads which was quite enough for the 4 hours.Chef is very experienced and friendly and let us take the lead.

I really liked the structure of the class, from arriving and meeting the staff, to learning the tea making process, and of course the preparations of the tagines and couscous. It's very hands on. The chef demonstrates what needs to be done and you go for it! While the meal is cooking, we had a bread demonstration. It was hard not to eat all of it while it's coming out of the clay oven. It's a really worth while experience!"

The staff was incredibly nice, knowledgable, and eager to help.

First we walked over the market square and through the soukhs to discover all kind of typical Maroccan food. Started with a fresh orange jus, and then tried different dades and other dried fruits, nuts, pastries, olives, herbs and spices, snails, special herb tea, and also visited a communal oven, where we sampled the fresh bread.Then Tarik took us to a restaurant where we had a marvelous diner. We started with two types of soup followed by eight different starters. Then it was time for the four main dishes, couscous, beef, chicken and lamb. As desert we had fresh fruit, and we finished with Maroccan tea with pastries. A great way to try this many different dishes.It was one of the best activities we did during our trip in Marocco. Highly recommended."

You are driven to a remote area (by a driver who picks you up!) and taken to an Eco friendly organic farm. This is where Chef Tarik and his crew welcome you to an opening in the field arranged with traditional Moroccan pillows and tables. This is where you sit together and have tea made the traditional way. You are taken then to a bellowing tent where you cook 5 different cuisines!! It's an unbelievable experience.

We booked airport transfers, a food tour, a day tour to Ait Bin Haddou, Spa and dinner at MK masion, our Riad and this cooking class and apart from the cooking class it all more than lived up to our expectations and would be something we wouldn't, hesitate to recommend to others. On the plus side the setting for the class was lovely and a nice break from busy Marrakesh, the staff was very polite.The whole experience was however much too formal and programmed with no deviance from the rushed schedule. There were not much actual cooking experience. Most things where prepared in advance. We got to chop a few things and learned to make a tomato rose! We were also allowed to add the spices and pull a turnip but under very close supervision. The cooking station was too low and the small slicing knife very blunt but then we weren't there for very long! There were no written instructions but we were promised that chef Tarik would send all the recipes to our mail but date we still haven't received anything from him.There was plenty of food at the following lunch but it wasn't nearly as tasty as the Morrocan meals we had at our Riad. To summerise the whole expirence should be more relaxed and hands on. It is also very expensive as we paid more for this than a five star meal experience at MK maison."

Chef Tarik explained to me, after our private cooking lesson, he had been a young chef working in Marrakesh when he proposed to the owner a new notion: a cooking class based upon an organic garden in an old village where workers return from the field under the midday sun herding cattle through the narrow street. All of the cooking, from herb tea to bread to tagines to vegetables is done over simple wood fires.Is it a skillful cooking lesson in Moroccan cuisine, spices and organic gardening along with a lovely lunch? Is it an amble through a village which has hardly changed over the course of years? Is it an opportunity to understand that traditional in this world can mean hundreds of years? Yes, all those things. And then magically, and almost inadvertently, it is a time machine which transports you into the core of cooking which underlies all of the work we do when we whir and grind and set our timers and download our recipes in our urban kitchens on distant shores.When you sit outside afterward on carpets under the shade of swatches of brightly colored fabrics, eating the remarkable dishes you have made together under the careful guiding hands of Chef Tarik, his assistant Yusef, Fatimeh who bakes bread in a Berber oven and Hussan who teaches you the art of making herbal tea, you look out on the gardens and past them you can see, if you half close your eyes, the centuries of time which you have transcended..We have been to wonderful cooking classes in North and South America, Asia and Europe. This was the first one which included in its equipment a time machine."

I make it a point to take a cooking class anytime I travel as it is usually a very nice time. This was by far the BEST cooking class I've ever taken. It isn't just a cooking class, it is an entire experience. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with such kindness. It was so evident that Chef Tarik loves what he does and is so passionate for his trade, as well as everyone we worked with that day. We also met and had the chance to work with Hassen, Youssef, and 3imad-all three of these individuals were amazing as well!!! We were in Morocco for 10 days, and we did the cooking class on our final full day. I think this was perfect because by this point, we had ate many tagines and had drank our body weight in Moroccan mint tea!! Because of this, the cooking class was that much more interesting. Tarik did an excellent job explaining all of the different spices, all of the different ingredients, and what goes into making the tea. Hassen was a tea master!! It was excellent. Aside from the tagines and salad, we also were able to see Moroccan bread be made by one of the women in the Berber village-this was so neat and absolutely delicious. It was truly special that the cooking class was located on a beautiful organic farm. It was so neat that and special to cook the food from the land. Tarik had great pride about this and he should have-it was amazing and so fresh! Aside from cooking, eating, and getting educated, Tarik and Hassen also gave us a tour of the garden and a walk around the Berber village. This was also great. By the time we finished, our meals were fully done being cooked and setup for us to eat. The overall setup of the farm was beautiful. We ate under a large tented area that had lovely colored pillows for us to sit under. To top things off, when we finished the class, Tarik let us keep our chef hats and aprons, and he also awarded all of us with \"graduation\" certificates. It was TOO cute!!! So fun and really rounded out the whole day. They also sent us away with good bags of some nice gifts. This place is a MUST SEE/DO while in Morocco. I would recommend to everyone and hope to be back!! Thank you thank you thank you to everyone at Atelier De Cuisine, Chef Tarik, and all those involved in making our experience so unforgettable! -Rachael, Matt, Rachel & Taylor"

The beautiful cooking school and organic garden is hidden away off a dirt road in a small village, approximately 20 minutes from the center of Marrakech. It is well worth the trip! We stopped in one morning on our way from the Atlas Mountains to Marrakech, and enjoyed a wonderful cooking class. We learned about all of the spices used to make the various tangines, and then we proceeded to pick fresh vegetables and herbs from the garden for our preparations. We all had the hands on experience of preparing chicken, lamb, and vegetable tangines, as well as a couple of salads. Chef Tarik was most patient in his instruction to my daughters and husband, none of whom have much experience chopping, slicing, dicing, or even general cooking. The food we prepared was some of the best we had during our entire stay (12 days) in Morocco. While the tangines were cooking, Chef Tarik took us on a walk through the local village which surrounds the cooking school, and it was wonderful to see how the local villagers live and to meet the very friendly children. When we returned, we got to see how the bread is made in the bread oven they have at the school (we observed and did not make the bread, which was fine with us; it was so fresh and warm when we ate it!). Of course our lunch ended, just as it began, with a traditional tea service (--we were instructed on how to make the tea as well). It was an excellent experience and I highly recommend it as an unusual way to spend some time in Morocco, and a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of the medinas."

I teach families and kids how to cook and love simple, seasonal foods. Our day with Chef Tarik, his assistant Joseph, and our tea master, Hassan, was one of the highlights of my two weeks in Morocco. We were joined by two lovely UK friends in our class, first learning how to make Moroccan mint tea from Hassan. I was so thrilled as I'd bought a tea pot and had hoped to teach kids back home this beautiful ceremony! On to spice mixtures--which was taught in such a beautiful way we could all remember...before we dived into hands-on cooking after exploring the beautiful organic vegetable gardens. Tarik is a great teacher, making us all have fun and learn while building our 3 Tagines and beautiful side dishes. A highlight for me was learning how Fatima made her breads (best I ate in Morocco) and seeing the three traditional ovens cooks use for baking breads, cooking Tangia, or making Mechoui bbq. And of course, we relished our gorgeous dishes at the end under a cool tent at a beautiful table (and Tarik's surprise dessert, which I'll also enjoy teaching kids back at home). A beautiful day--so well done by the entire staff. As they say in Arabic, it was \"ladiid\" from beginning to end, which means delicious, and a big \"Chokran bisef\" from Chef Hollie from Joyfoodly!"

What sets this class apart is the organic concept, the involvement of the local community and the excellent and professional service. The pickup from the hotel went super smooth and the driver David was even there 15min before the agreed time. We drove roughly 30 min out of town to the organic farm, with the Atlas Mountains in the background. It was only the 2 of us in the course, I think usually it is about 6. The class itself includes an introduction into the moroccan tea ceremony, and the most important spices. Main part is the preparation of 3 different tagines and salads. When the tagines are on the fire to cook, a lady from the village shows, how the bread is traditionally prepared. To spend the time until the tagines are done we took a walk through the village with Samir and Hassan and enjoyed the sun and the stunning scenery, before having the delicious dinner. For the desert Samir has prepared a very fancy fruit-yoghurt cookie arrangement with bananas and a very tasty sauce. Thanks again for this very nice experience!!! It is defiantly a highlight of our trip!"

            "review": "An Experience to Thrill Your Senses!. One of my personal highlights of travelling are visiting markets, tasting new cuisines and learning to cook it if there are coking classes available. It's common that cooking classes are combined with visits to the market, but it is very uncommon to combine picking your own ingredients and then cooking with them. And it is because of this reason that we chose to take a cooking class with Atelier de Cuisine Chef Tarik. I contacted the Atelier online, enquired about their availability and confirmed our pick up location at our Riad in a few emails. We are not heavy meat eaters so I requested that we make mostly vegetarian dishes with one fish dish which they accommodated. On the morning of our course a mother and daughter asked if we were taking a cooking course during our stay and we encouraged them to contact the Atelier to see if they could join us. Within an hour of our pick-up the Atelier had arranged for a bus to pick the six of us up and off we went to the farm. The farm is located about 30 minutes out of the city on a farm closer to the mountains. We only had two and half days in Marrakech and wanted to explore both the city and some of the surrounding area and do a cooking class. This course allowed us to make a day-trip out of the city and cook some fantastic dishes in a bucolic environment with the snow-capped mountains framing the backdrop to this beautiful day. A driver picked us up in town and drove us to the farm. We were then welcomed with a traditional tea ceremony and the chefs provided us with an overview of the day's activities (we booked the \"standard\" cooking class) which included:- tea ceremony and instructions on how to make Moroccan tea- overview of typical Moroccan spices and four main flavour combinations used in tagines and couscous dishes- walk through the garden where we picked some (not all) of the vegetables that we prepared- preparation of three tagines, three salads, and a vegetable couscous under a woven canopy in the garden- snack of fresh goats cheese and bread hot out of the over 1 metre from the table- walk to a neighbouring village in a valley (highlights were walking through the fields and fantastic views of the mountains)- feast on the dishes we made- surprise dessert- certificate ceremony- return to MarrakechThe instruction we received throughout the whole day was comprehensive, thorough, and responsive to our enquiries. All of the staff on the farm were fantastic! They anticipated our needs and provided us with such excellent hospitality. The quality of the ingredients was fantastic and the dishes that we made were the best that we tasted in Morocco. At one point during the day we discussed the feeling of needing to \"see things\" when you travel, to check off the major sights to make experiences and then contrasted it to where we were - on a beautiful farm, learning from two experienced chefs, and truly celebrating Moroccan cuisine - and what an experience we were making right then. So leave the city behind and strike out for new horizons that will please all of your senses!"

My partners in crime and myself really enjoyed this experience as we got our manicured hands dirty, chopping and dicing vegetables and meat. There was a host of other activities throughout the day but our final adventure had us all walking to the nearby village.

Once through the farm gates we glimpsed a well tended organic garden brimming with fresh hers and vegetables. Our chef spoke mostly in French and his assistant translated for us. They patiently and carefully explained the time honoured ritual of tea making, the spices used in the food and how they were used. Next they let us loose with (fairly blunt) knives to chop a prepare the meat and veg for each of the dishes we were making. Very much a hands-on course where you get to eat what you cooked. My advice is not to book a big dinner for the evening - you won't need it. We were the only two people on the course that day so we had the very best of attention. They can cater for larger groups but may need a bit more notice than just the night before.A great experience - and it didn't rain after all!"

Both we and our friends found this the crowning experience of our visit. As we all participated in cooking a delicious lunch of tagines and salad and partook of mint tea, we seemed to be filling ourselves with the essence of this fascinating, complex and culturally rich country. A tour of the farm and a walk through the nearby village rounded out the visit. The very talented, charming Chef Tarik has given us one of our fondest memories of Morocco. If you are in Marrakech, do make the effort to visit \" Atelier de Cuisine Chef Tarik.\""

The recipes are necessarily on the simple side, but are typical Moroccan dishes, and you get a real feel for how to cook with a tagine, very helpful indeed if you've never done it before, as I hadn't. After the class, you proceed downstairs to the lovely courtyard dining area, and are served the food you have prepared, carried down by the staff.

This obviously has been constructed very recently as everything is sparkling new. You get to cook most of the meal in a tagine. At the end of the class they gave us a small tagine to take home.I probably learned more about spices in this class than in any other previous classes.Of course you eat the food you prepare at the end of the preparation.What a great alternate to another day of touring and shopping!"

I was slightly concerned that I might be getting into an experience with a whole load of frustrated Jamie Oliver's/Mary Berry/Paul Hollywood/Delia Smiths etc. ..........but I needn't have worried! Our lovely group of a young Swiss couple, three French girls, my Mum and I from the UK and six Americans were soon chatting and laughing about the experiences we had already encountered on respective holidays in Marrakech. We were met at La Maison Arabe (if I can afford it next time I visit Marrakech, this is definitely where I will stay - beautiful interior, a real oasis of calm in the middle of the frenetic Medina and so luxurious!). Whilst we waited for everyone to arrive, we were treated to a presentation of a pot of mint tea. In our 4 days in Marrakech we drank a lot of mint tea - nowhere was it as good though as it is at La Maison Arabe - it was honestly amazing - I would be a convert to the drink if I could emulate that quality at home! We were then picked up in two air conditioned mini-buses and we took the interesting drive to the cookery workshop. Set in the midst of beautiful and peaceful gardens, we were welcomed and shown our cookery stations. Immaculately clean, with all the ingredients ready for us, sharp knives and all the implements needed along with the infamous tagine ready for us to start cooking with it. First though we had a very interesting talk about the spices used in Moroccan cooking, an excellent demonstration of how to make authentic and traditional mint tea (not sure I have time sadly to do this justice when at home in the UK!) and then a bread making demonstration which we were all invited to stretch the dough for our own individual flat breads before placing them in the brick oven on hot stones.We then saw a demonstration of pastry sweets being made and again we were invited to help. Then it was on to the real show.........the making of two typical Moroccan salads and a chicken tagine with lemons and olives. You are putting in your own ingredients so if you don't like olives, you don't have to have them. My mother can't stand garlic, so she didn't put it in her tagine.......she was, after all, going to be eating it after it was cooked! The staff who come around and helped you if needed were very encouraging and smiley.We were asked at one point to leave the tagines for a moment and to please sing \"Happy Birthday\"..........this was in my honour and it was a lovely moment - as too, was the cake and candle that came out when we were about to tuck into pudding after eating our tagines and salad!After we had made our food, the tagines were labelled up and we went and sat outside in the sunshine under a canopy at a huge table. It was like something from a film, everyone very easily chatting away and enjoying the food they had made. Water was provided, with wine a small chargeable extra.There was time to look around the small but very tasteful gift shop and we received our certificates which were presented with applause, along with a gift bag containing a ceramic tagine.I am so glad we trusted the reviews on Trip Advisor as this was definitely a real highlight of our holiday and one we have bored our friends and family with, talking about it and showing them all our photographs!!"

First, the instructor does a great job of explaining the history behind Moroccan cuisine, and she even gave us a little tour of spices at a local shop. Additionally, the instructional kitchen is perfect. It's very modern and at each station, you have your own burners, sink, and even a screen that shows what the cook is doing every moment in case you're not near her station. We learned how to cook a chicken tagine, and two salads--one cooked and one half-cooked. Everything turned out so perfectly! As gifts, they even gave us small tagines to take home!"

This is where the locals bring their dough to be baked in a large shared brick oven. We then when back to the hotel to do our cooking. We prepared 3 dishes and the bread. Our chef was able to knit together the history of Moroccan cooking with practical hands on experience which would be difficult to find anywhere else."

The Cooking Workshops at La Maison Arabe provided just such an opportunity. The experience deftly walks the line between authentic and modern by providing local instructors (and English-speaking translators) in a purpose-built pristine teaching kitchen complete with perfectly organized work stations and television monitors so you don't miss any steps. The whole thing happens at a beautifully kept property just outside town. Highlights of the experience include learning to make bread in a traditional oven (though you get to watch and eat the delicious bread you do not prepare it yourself) and being instructed in the subtleties of the Moroccan tea ritual. I would strongly recommend this experience for anyone with epicurean inclinations."

And make sure to appreciate the incredible woodwork around doors and trim; some of the nicest that I've seen.Then a 15 minute ride in their van to their classroom kitchen out at the country club. The outside setting is beautiful and calm, with nice brickwork and herb gardens.First, we got a demonstration of traditional bread making in their wood fired oven. The woman making the bread shaped and kneaded the dough with the casual ease of someone that has done this thousands of times. Along with the bread making was a demonstration of making traditional Moroccan tea. And there is a definite technique and art to making this tea. So, at this point, we've had a lovely snack of bread fresh from the oven and a wonderful green/herb/mint tea.Then a tour of the herb gardens and explanations of what herbs are used in Moroccan cooking for what purposes (and what herb not used). And a quick look at their underground oven for roasting lamb (kind of a cross between a tandoori and burying the lamp under ground).Into the kitchen we went and it's just a beautiful, artful, elegant and modern/traditional space. Picture yourself on a cooking contest, with your own station, stove, cutting board, cutlery, and a bunch of ingredients.Before we started cooking, we got a demonstratoin of making a traditional sesame coated cookie, and an explanation (along with smells) of the various spices.Our host, Youssef led us through the various steps, with a chef at the front station demonstrating each thing we had to do. And you had a screen in front of you zoomed in to the chef's station to see exactly what was happening.At our sessions, we made the chicken tagine with preserved lemons (my favorite), a cooked tomato/eggplant salad, and a salad with fresh tomatoes and grilled green peppers.I'll let you experience the details for yourself, but the food came our great. Everyone from the most experienced chef to super beginners produced a result they enjoyed. I have to say it was the best preserved lemon chicken tagine that we had during our week in Morocco.Then we all sat at the long tables in front of the cook stations and enjoyed an leisurely dinner, each chowing down on our individually cooked dishes. With the dinner, we had more freshly made bread, mineral water and (if you choose, and pay extra) wine.If the hub hub and frantic pace of Marrakesh gets a bit much, this is just an amazing and fun experience. Definitely great for family time. The skeptics in our family came away smiling and more than content."

I was impressed by how well the kitchen classroom is equipped and there were no downtime in the entire experience. Also, it was nice to be away from the city/medina and enjoy the nature. A bit pricey ( 600dhs per person and do not expect the food to taste good) but just for the experience and something to do other than staying in the Medina. At the end of the class you also get a real Tagine pot as a gift but I wonder how they expect travellers to put that into their suitcase when there are so many more attractive souvenir you can occupy your suitcase with. Is a nice gesture but they should consider a smaller gift that is less heavy and fits into the luggage."

For me, this tagine cooking class was a welcome break from being aroundMoroccan men, for all the assistants and cooks were female and the mainguide spoke excellent English and, unlike most Moroccan men I'd had as\"guides\" and \"drivers,\" the female staff at this cooking school were all very, very cooperative and sensitive to my interests. I wondered why a cooking class cost around US $200 until I saw the very modern setup with spotless gas stoves and the TV monitor simulcast showing the two cooks demonstrating every step of preparing the recipes, while the English speaking guide stayed at my elbow assisting me. The lamb and fig tagine that resulted was a darn sight better than any of the mediocre tagines I'd had at hotel restaurants in Morocco to that point. I'm home now and I will try out the little tagine pot they gifted me with as soon as I get a chance to."

Beautiful grounds filled with trees, plants, flowers and all the herbs used in the dishes we prepared and the tea we drank. The kitchen itself was beyond professional. I cannot imagine it is not used for television demonstrations.I'm guessing there were 16 of us that day arranged in a u-shape with the chef in front demonstrating and also shown on closed circuit TV. Each of us had our own station with a TV screen, sink, two burners, and all the necessary implements. The chef was excellent and there were several assistants who helped those who wanted extra hands (like my husband.) We prepared two salads and a wonderful tagine (the best we ate in Morocco--probably because we could add extra spices ). We finished the day sitting under an arbor in the garden eating our creations and drinking 3 selections of wine with our new and interesting friends from all over the world. An excellent experience and highly recommended. We wrapped up the day at a Hammam for a scrub and massage."

While you wait at the gorgeous hotel, you are served tea and cookies. The vans actually leave at 10 (being on time is surprising in Morocco) and take you to their country club. Here they have a traditional oven where you make bread and are taught how to serve tea.The best part of this class was that it was not just directions but an explanation of both the history and influences of the cuisine and why each step is done. They also encourage everyone everyone to ask questions.When the cooking starts, everyone gets their own personal cooking station and makes their own tagine and salads to their liking. The stations are the most high tech and organized I have ever seen (see pictures). Each station has a screen to see what the chef in front is preparing and helpers come around. When its time for the meal, you all sit down for a delicious filling lunch. As you leave, they give you a very small tagine as a gift. This is the best non-historic thing to do in Marrakech."

We were picked up at our hotel and ferried to La Maison Arabe (hotel), and then served mint tea and petit fours whilst we waited for our fellow cooks. We were then whisked off to another venue, sadly with little direction as what was happening, and then the minibus pulled up to a rather inauspicious door. When it was opened, it revealed the most idyllic garden and driveway. We drove up and were warmly greeted, watered and sat in the shaded sunshine where we were talked through thoroughly the agenda for the day, before being taken through to the most wonderful kitchen. A central station stands in front of a horse-shoe shaped classroom of the most decadent nature, and each of us had our very own workstation with hob, sink and everything we could possibly need, including... a television screen in front of us, showing exactly what was being demonstrated up at the front. As we were talked through every stage of the recipes, assistants cleared and mopped as we went, and miraculously appeared with ingredients at the perfect moment. We ate our wares in a lovely group table at the end - everyone had produced the same dishes, yet they were all slightly different! Really great instruction, good level of detail, and a wonderful setting - a Moroccan must do!"

At the end we got given a tagine so we can put into practice all we learned when we returned home which was a lovely thought.Rick Stein's cookery school in Padstow is the nearest major centre of this kind near me but it wasn't a patch on this course and three or four times the cost of the Marakesh experience.

Then each person when to their own station to prepare and cook tajine -- food cooked over a flame in little clay dishes with conical covers with vents to let out steam. The ingredients were there for us, and we sliced and diced and mashed and added the ingredients to the tajine in order at the proper time. (Oh -- and to cut up a salad.) Each station was modern, well-equipped, and came with a large screen to see what the instructor was doing on the cooking stage via close-up camera. We were impressed with the sophistication of the facility and how well organized it was. Once done we ate our hot meal as a lunch with drinks at an extra cost. It was a far greater experience than we imagined and we can't recommend it enough as something different and interesting to do in Marrakech."

We were two women friends travelling and just something to be wary of (still not sure whether this was a tourist trap or not). We left the medina close to closing (around 9.00pm) and, as usual, had lost our way. We entered a square where one of the stallholders, who were clearing up, shouted 'they are closing the gates'. Feeling a little panicky we were unsure what to do, go back or try to get out before gates shut. A young guy (about 18) said 'Quickly, follow me, which we gratefully did. He led us through the maze to the outside of the medina. He was very pleasant and chatted as he led us along. Outside we thanked him and offered him the equivalent of around a \u00a310 tip as a token of our thanks. At this point things turned nasty. 'You want me to call my friends round, this amount is an insult! The end result, we paid him around \u00a340. I feel embarrassed about this amount. On reflection we should have stood our ground but in a foreign country, in an area we didn't know we felt threatened into paying this.

The chef gave a wonderful lecture about Moroccan food tradition, the cuisine's origins, demonstrated the spices and was available all the time for assistance, as was his co-chef, who was not an English speaker but did speak French. We had ample time to cook a tagine, bake bread, make two salads and eat all at lunch. We also had a demonstration of the art of Moroccan mint tea. There was a tour of a spice shop (rather a bit chi-chi and not like a souk spice stall, but still interesting) and the community bread oven, which was amazing to see. They were roasting nuts, but bread was waiting to go into the brick oven. The workshop is a kitchen in a small, boutique hotel of 26 rooms and done in the traditional Moroccan style.

I get maybe it was to save time but we were waiting at the dining tables drinking water whilst they were getting organised in the kitchen. Think they were running late in the kitchen that day but I would have preferred to be hands on rather than sitting around waiting. You also go to a nearby bakery to see how they cook bread, then to a spice shop... and also learn how to make and pour Moroccan Mint Tea. It was all pretty basic stuff. At the end you get a mini Targine but for the price, a glass wine or a packet of spice would have added just that bit more value.

From the first moment that the cover is lifted from a tagine and the aromas of turmeric , saffron, and cumin drift out, if you are a cook, or just a lover of food, you want to know how it is made. There is no better place to begin to explore the preparation of Moroccan food than the cooking school at La Maison Arabe. It has a well deserved reputation of being one of, if not the best, schools in Marrakech. Certainly I would say, having experienced many cooking schools, it is the best equipped that I have ever seen. Each student has their own station which includes a television screen, a 2 burner cooktop, a sink and a large prep area. Our chef and instructress for the day, Dada Ayada, spoke only Arabic or French and since we had only limited French the cooking workshops manager, Wafaa Amagui, acted as interpreter and also gave us a preliminary but detailed introduction to Moroccan cuisine, its methods and spice profile. While we did not prepare a couscous dish we received sufficient description that I am confident we could prepare one successfully. Our morning started with a visit to a spice vendor where we learned about the various unusual spices and their combinations and had an opportunity to make purchases. Afterwards we visited a traditional fire driven brick and stone oven bakery, not one where baked items could be purchased, but rather one where items which had been prepared in neighborhood homes were brought to be baked. The rest of our morning was spent \"hands on\" under the watchful eyes of both instructor and interpreter preparing a Berber vegetable tagine and a chicken tagine with preserved lemons and olives, taktuka, a tomato and pepper salad, zalouk an egplant salad, and khohz, the traditional round Moroccan bread. We learned about the intricate process of making perfect mint tea, pouring it from on high to aerate and cool, into traditional glass cups. Feeling very accomplished, with anticipation and great delight, we sat down to the lovely lunch that we had just cooked, seated at a poolside table, and toasted the success of our experience with Moroccan wines which had been chosen to complement what we had prepared."

It was a lot of fun and the dishes I created actually tasted pretty good (even my wife said so). They do a great job leading the class so you don't have to be an expert. The off site location is really nice with an extra large kitchen. Each person gets their own station. The other nice part of this type of activity is that you get to meet people from around the world and have a meal together. Helps reduce the tourist \"bubble\" on a trip. Highly recommend."

They gave a certificate at the end of the class and a Tajine cookware as souvenir. The tajine cookware was fragile and bulky to carry in our suitcase.I would strongly suggest that they give us the apron we used as the souvenir. it is light to carry in our suitcase and a great advertising for the cooking class too."

The first one we were only 7 people so we got to use the cooking classroom at the Riad inside the Medina. The ladies were wonderful and the class was so much fun!!This year we were 14 so we had to use their space outside the city at their Country Club which is about 15 minutes away in the Palmiarie. We had a blast. Their vans met us to take the group out and we were greeted by the smiling faces of the ladies and another fun and informative class!! The food was delicious and everyone had a BLAST!We got to help make bread, learn to make mint tea, and of course the salads and tagine were all great. They give you a little tagine gift to take home and your 'diploma'! adorable.You can choose your menu which I didn't realize so next year we will switch it up and do some lamb! They accommodated our vegetarians and gluten free people wonderfully also which was fantastic.Our group decided to make a day of it and we brought our suits to hang by the pool and the gardens for the rest of the afternoon. They charge 200MAD per person for this but we loved it after full bellies from lunch! (*btw Moroccan swimming pools are FREEEEZing across the board. at least in October but we got in anyway. fyi!)Plus it is a real value for all the experience and the great fun you have.Highly Highly recommend this cooking course!"

A monitor over the preparation area allowed you to see what was being demonstrated. We each had a two burner cook top with a tagine and a frying pan. With the assistance of the circulating helpers we prepared two salads, a chicken tagine with lemon and olives, coconut cookies and a pastille for dessert. Wine is available if one wanted it. We were given the recipes and a bit of the background about the many influences on Moroccan foods. There were about 16 in the class and it was fun, congenial and so good.

All four of us thoroughly enjoyed our experience.This is really a topnotch program, with excellent facilities and teachers. The day began outdoors at the oven where traditional bread was being baked. We learned about Moroccan tea and the many spices used in Moroccan cooking. Once inside the kitchen where we all had our own cooktops and supplies, we made two Moroccan salads and lamb tagine. Once done, we ate what we prepared for lunch in the delightful company of our classmates from South Africa, England and Italy."

There are TV screens at each workstation to see what the chef instructor is doing, and the whole room is air conditioned so a very comfortable experience indeed.We learned how to make Moroccan salads and a chicken lemon tagine. We then got to eat our creations - as well as a dessert from the kitchen - in their tranquil restaurant at the Maison Arabe hotel where the cookery school is located.At 600 Dirhams per person it isn't a cheap experience for a 3 hour class and a meal, but we really enjoyed it, the teacher was great, the class kitchen was professional, clean, and well set up."

Our kids joined in making bread at the start and the staff could not have been more helpful with them through the cooking itself. The food actually tasted great as well. That may have been helped by the tasting wine menu as well. Eating macaroons fresh from the oven in a herb garden in Marrakech - life's memories are made of these moments."

There was more to the day than simply learning how to create delicious chicken tagine, tomato roses or aubergine and pepper salads. The facilities were spacious, stylish and well equipped. The team led by Wafaa were efficient and professional, yet they also created a friendly and informal atmosphere, with their jokes and anecdotes about cooking and eating in Morocco. During the morning we sampled typical foods such as freshly baked flat breads dipped in olive oil, a creamy pastry and watched Moroccan tea being made (not how you'd expect!) Sitting in the beautiful tranquil gardens, eating what we had cooked for lunch, rounded off a very enjoyable morning. And the gift tagine we received at the end was a nice touch!Reviewed by Suzette M"

The cooking workshop at La Maison Arabe was seriously the best thing we did in Marrakech - the setting was just stunning, set within a beautiful, peaceful garden. Our host and the Dada (cook) were super friendly and helpful (and funny). To top it off, at the end of the class we got to eat a really delicious meal (prepared ourselves!) while sitting in the lovely garden in the sun. The cooking was in a fantastic kitchen studio, with independent working stations and small flat screen TVs that allowed us to see what the Dada was doing up close. It was also nice that it wasn't a huge class - there were only 7 of us doing the class when we did, which was really nice as it felt like we each had individual attention. The class was well pitched - not too tricky, but not too easy either - and the food selection was great. I also really enjoyed the lessons on how to make mint tea, bake bread, and about the important spices in Moroccan cooking. It was just a really pleasant way to spend the day - definitely recommended."

Led by Mohammed Nahir, we learnt much about couscous, spices and other ingredients in traditional Moroccan cuisine. A visit to a nearby spice shop helped us to visualize and usually by smell determine which spice was which. Before starting into cooking we stopped at the community baking oven, since many have no ovens in their homes, dough is prepared at home and brought here to be baked. Very interesting.Back at the workshop kitchens, each of us had an individual workspace consisting of two burners, a half-sink and all the ingredients to make a chicken Tagine and two salads in the course. Of course, we had a glass of wine to help with the cooking process. Mohammed was very clear and Ida with Fatima showed us how to prepare the ingredients , whether to dice or chop or julienne and prepare our dishes. We started by each learning to knead dough for the bread to accompany the meal, as we then set out to prepare the Tagine and salads.Great fun, very informative and the best part was when we finished we sat outside in an interior patio overlooking the pool and each of us enjoyed the meal we had just made, accompanied by excellent Moroccan wines. What a treat! I would highly recommend this half-day cooking workshop for anyone, cook or not. You'll have fun and finish with an excellent meal, one that you made."

The class itself is very professional as they have a workstation kitted out with screens so even if you are not right next to the teacher you can see everything that is being done. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, and most importantly encouraging along the way about our progress! We learnt to make traditional bread (everyone just gets a go at the kneading to feel the texture of the dough), see the tea ceremony, and got to make a tagine and 2 salads for ourselves, as well a garnish of a rose out of tomato peel! The food was delicious and is nice that we get to sit down together and enjoy our culinary skills! You get given the recipes to take away, but as we sat over lunch talking about buying tagines so we can reproduce it at home, it was a great surprise to learn that you get given one at the end so there is no excuse not to bring the Moroccan flavours home!

The morning began with our very welcoming and knowledgeable host Mohammed explaining the main principles and ingredients of Moroccan cookery. He then took us to a local public bread oven and on to a boutique shop where he explained further about Moroccan spices. We then returned to the Maison Arabe and entered the class kitchen to cook. Fatiha, our wonderful chef, first mixed some dough to make Moroccan bread, and all of the class had a chance to knead it. This was a lovely way to be put at ease with the other classmates! We were all then led through the process of cooking our own chicken and preserved lemon tagines and two Moroccan salads. All of the ingredients were provided and some already part-prepared to save time, but aside from this you do actually do most of the preparation and cooking of the dishes. Both Fatiha and Mohammed were really friendly, entertaining and helpful, explaining everything step by step and answering any questions we had. At the end of the class, all the classmates got to sit down together to enjoy lunch of the tagines and bread we had made. We were given the recipes to take away, and after lunch we were all also given a gift of a small tagine, which was a lovely touch. Mohammed was also true to his word and emailed me the recipes for the dishes when I realised I had lost them on returning to the UK. I would highly recommend this class as a really interesting, informative and fun activity to add to your trip to Marrakech, regardless of cooking ability or whether you are travelling as a couple, family, with friends or alone. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"

We were expecting something of quality given the status of La Maison Arabe, but this cooking experience is at the same level or above many of the cooking schools I have attended in Europe. First of all you meet up in the hotel lobby (we were not staying there) and the drive you to a beautiful country estate with wonderful gardens including herbs and vegetables. We went with our 3 teenage boys who absolutely loved the experience. With us was a wonderful American family with boys as well which made the whole experience even more fun.First explanation was seated in the gazebo in the middle of the garden explaining how the correct Moroccan mint tea is serves. We also saw them cooking bread which we tasted with olive oil.Back in the cooking pavilion we were extremely surprised at the quality of everything. Separate coking stations with a TV monitor in from of you to have a detailed view of what the cook was doing. The explanations were wonderful and the food we ended up cooking and eating outside in a beautiful setting was delicious. Special salads and delicious chicken tagine. The whole thing took a good 3 hours and worth every minute.We bought the cookbook and were given a small tagine as a gift.If you want to learn about Moroccan cooking, understand their spices, have fun and a delicious meal this is THE place. At 60 Euros per person we felt it was excellent value too.A must in Marakech!"

We learnt an amazing amount about Moroccan food and culture and I now feel very confident in tackling the cuisine at home. There was a great sense of generosity from our hosts who gave us gifts of tagine dishes so we could continue cooking at home. We had a tour of the kitchen garden and drank the best mint tea I had tried in Morocco. It was prepared according to traditional methods, using the best quality tea and herbs, grown and picked in their own garden.The class was very satisfying, the food we cooked was amazing and the technology supporting the general execution of the workshop very impressive.Highly recommended!"

We were lucky that we were the only two people who had booked the afternoon class and so got personal attention throughout. The class leader Mohamed is actually a Professor of English at the University, so no language problems ! After a 30-minute whirlwind lecture on the basics of Moroccan cuisine (how to make an authentic couscous, tagine, pastille and a bit about the use of spices), you are taken to the hotel's spice and cookware shop for a run through the various spices (we returned to the shop next day to buy some of their beautifully displayed ceramics). Then it's on to the cooking - after learning how to knead dough, we were taken step-by-step though making a chicken tagine and two salads with the support of a chef and assistant. The teaching kitchen was immaculately set up and with all mod cons, although, because we were such a small group, we had no need of the video screens in front of each workstation. Mid-way through the class, we were refreshed with tisane and biscuits. At the end of the class, we were invited to sit down at a restaurant table in the courtyard outside the classroom to eat our meal, The setting is spectacularly verdant and beautiful around a pool. The food was delicious - although my wife thought there was too much pepper in the aubergine salad, I pointed out that she could hardly complain as she had cooked It herself ! The cost of the class was 600 dirham per person (about \u00a345) but as this includes the cost of the meal, it is excellent value.

They have a very intimate setting, their kitchen faces the inner courtyard, next to the pool where water trickles out of the lion's heads, it's very peaceful and serene. I particularly enjoyed hearing why we were preparing the food the way we were, why we saved the lemon rinds, why we made the traditional mint tea the way we did, why we added certain spices to specific dishes, how they bake their bread, By the end of our cooking lesson we sat down next to the trickling water and were served the food we'd prepared, it was a moment, and the food was delicious, i could not believe that I had made it.

I booked via email a few months in advance, which was probably a good idea since the courses that week seemed quite full.The course begins with a talk about Moroccan cooking and a sampling of some of the breakfast dishes from the hotel (the pancakes are excellent), followed by mint tea. We then went around the corner to see a baker and to visit the hotel gift shop for a talk through some spices. If the course could be improved, I think this is where it would be... a more interesting visit to a spice shop in the souks would be far better, although is perhaps a little too time consuming given that it's only a half day course.Once the cooking gets started, the staff are very helpful in ensuring that everybody is keeping up with the pace. While it wasn't the most complicated of recipes, there was plenty to keep you occupied... the tomato peeling and rose making were probably the most challenging part.The small tagine you get as a gift at the end is a nice touch, although a little difficult to pack in to your luggage! I think the Maison Arabe branded aprons would have been a better choice."

It was a relaxing break from the buzz of Marrakesh."

The cookery school is well set up and very clean, with screens showing the Dada's work station so you can copy exactly what she is doing. The interpreter gave us an interesting introduction to Moroccan food and another chef prepared some breakfast pancakes for us before we cooked - they were delicious. They catered for my vegetarianism - I made a vegetable tagine while the rest of the group made chicken and lemon tagines. We also made some delicious warm salads and side dishes, and bread. The experience also included a trip to the nearby bakery to have our bread cooked, and a visit to the hotel spice shop. At each place, the interpreter explained everything clearly and concisely. After cooking, we ate our food. It was the best meal (as a vegetarian) that I had in my 10 day trip, and we enjoyed it so much that we returned a couple of times to eat here. We were also given a tagine dish at the end, and a leaflet containing all of our recipes to try again at home."

Then we got into the kitchen where we each have our own cooking station. We made lemon chicken tagine, sounds basic but actually has a nice balance of many flavors. After having many delicious tagines this one is still my favorite! We also made appetizers like one with eggplant and tomato and one with roasted giant sweet peppers. I loved that meal but maybe it tasted better because I had to work for it :p definitely recommend it! They also have us tagine pots as gifts at the end :)"

All of our group were English speaking and both instructors were perfectly fluent. We started with a trip back in time learning about the history of Moroccan food and its basic principles and influences. To follow we paid a visit to a local bakery and the hotel gift shop where we went through all the difference spices involved in Moroccan cooking. We then walked back to the hotel and into the professionally kitted out kitchens fitted with TVs to guide. We helped make traditional bread before making 2 Moroccan starters and a chicken tagine! Once completed we were taken to the restaurant where we were then served our creations. Probably the nicest tagine we had all week! Before we left we also were given a surprise gift!

My 12 year old daughter and I attended the afternoon session and made the Tangine chicken. When we arrived we were seated at a table and the Chef talked about Moroccan cooking, spices, how to make couscous, and history. We then went to a communal baking oven and then the spice shop. Then back to the Riad for 2 hours of cooking.The nice thing about this cooking class is that each person has their own work space, with a TV screen in front, so it's easy to watch the demonstration. Two people ran the class, one doing the demo, one assisting the class. They were wonderful with my daughter who does know her way around the kitchen.Easy to follow instructions, ingredients at our side, we had an amazing time learning how to use the Tangine. Once we were done,,we were escorted to the dining room where we enjoyed eating what we made. We had a wonderful time, and actually tried to get into another class, but they were full.

After being in Morocco for several days across three cities, I had been a little unimpressed with the cuisine because everything had just started to taste alike. When I arrived at the cooking class, I was a bit disappointed to hear that we would be cooking a tagine because the idea seemed pretty basic. But wow! The attention to detail and combination of spices was incredible! I was very satisfied with the outcome of the efforts and after consuming the savory meal, wished that all of my tagine experiences in Morocco had been as delectable as that! The hosts are very dynamic and make you feel welcome and competent (even if you don't have much culinary experience). They were also very accommodating, happily switching my chicken tagine for a vegetarian one, even after we had already started preparations. The kitchen is just as pictured and each person is provided with their own station, oils, and spices. You are even given a gift upon completion of your time together. Well worth it!"

Every day there are 2 cooking classes - morning and afternoon. And the recipies of those classes are different. So you can spend the whole day there. They teach you to cook 2 appetizers and 1 main dish (vegetarian for vegetarians) and 1 dessert, which you eat at the end of the cooking class. The reciepies are real, not the ones that you just read or hear and realize that you'd never be able to cook it yourself. So even if you are not a great cook, but love good food, you will love a cooking class at \"La maison Arabe\"!"

At the end of the class we sat down with our fellow attendees and ate our delicious meals.

Pros: Modern facilities, great location, excellent host, mini tagine to take away, eat what you make, no pressure to buy things from spice shopCons: A little fast-paced at times, be prepared to eat with your group, pricier than others (but worth it I think)Moroccan cooking, at its best, is divine. So to be let into the secrets of how it's done - though, honestly, it's all fairly simple stuff - is great fun. I'd wanted to do a cookery class for a while and spent ages assessing different courses via Tripadvisor and other sources. I settled on La Maison Arabe and I'm so glad that I did as it was good fun and the facilities were top notch too. You eat what you make, so you'll need to put your heart into it for a decent lunch! You'll also eat with the rest of your group, so if you're not a conversational type then this might not be the thing for you. But I think it's a nice way to chat to others while away. As educational as the class is, it can get a bit fast paced from time to time. If you fall behind there'll be some help to get you back on track though. The host spoke perfet English to help everything along, including historical food references and functional cooking tips. The \"dada\" (cook) spoke little to no English, but her gesturing and actions were all that was needed. On our course we made bread (the dada did all the hard stuff though), cooked a chicken tagine and made some side salads (hot and cold). There was also a desert - but that was assembled by the kitchen to serve. Between bread making and cooking there's a visit to the spice shop (a private shop, not a market stall) for a tea-making experience, and later a visit to the communal bakery (no daytime fire during Ramadan, of course). It's a full experience that'd be good for friends, couples or groups. Not one for kids though.Take a bit of extra cash along and browse the wine list at lunch. It's hard to come by the red and white stuff in Morocco for the most part, so it felt like an extra treat on top of the cooking treat. I'd happily do it again, assuming it was a different set of courses on the menu."

Four aussie ladies visited La Maison Arabe last week (Sep 2012) to participate in one of the best cooking workshops we have experienced that became one of our favourite afternoons in Marrakesh. The half day cooking workshop was conducted by the expert, enthusiastic and patient chef Mohammad whose english was impeccable and knowledge of Morioccan cuisine and culture was extensive. He was ably assisted by the very capable Moroccan bread cook. I am sure we amused her with some of our techniques!! We cooked an aubergine dish, a grilled green pepper salad, prepared and cooked a chicken tajine with olives and visited the hotel's retail outlet to learn how to make mint tea and to identify some exotic spices. Not only did we get to eat our own delicious creations, but we were also treated to a delicious dessert. At the end of our feast we received some recipes and a little gift. A highly recommended and rewarding experience. Wahdiah Hopper"

I urge anyone with a slight interest in cooking, Moroccan cuisine or new experiences to try this. The riad itself is an amazing place and we were warmly welcomed with water by the pool and as a group of about 10, told a brief & interesting history of Morocco. The cookery class itself was great fun and easy to follow (you don't need to be a good cook!). We all had a go at making bread, then our own individual salads and tajine. The two instructors were energetic, helpful and entertaining! The course included a visit to the local bakery to see how the bread is baked, as well as to the hotel spice shop, where we got to see & smell more spices than I knew existed. We were also shown the authentic way Moroccan mint tea, as well as sampling it during a nice rest. Once the cooking was done, we sat down to eat & thoroughly enjoy what we had produced! We were given the recipes to take away, as well as a small tajine which is functional as well as decorational. The only slight downside was getting a taxi afterwards. Although the hotel was helpful in getting us a taxi, the drivers were very hard to bargain with & wanted a much higher price than it should be (maybe because they knew we had just come out of one of the luxury riads and/or maybe there is a cartel going on?) However, this didn't spoil what was a wonderful experience and a must do during a visit to Marrakech!"

As part of the workshop, we:-Helped make Moroccan bread-Cooked a Moroccan aubergine dish-Made a Moroccan green pepper salad-Prepared and cooked a chicken tajine-Visited the hotel's boutique to learn how to make saffron tea and to learn about spices-Visited a traditional Moroccan bakery-Had a pastilla (with ice cream)Water was also served regularly.As a 'present' at the end of the day, we were all given a gift bag with a traditional tajine inside.We would recommend the day to anybody. We had come across slightly cheaper cooking courses but the setting alone made this good value for money, considering that a tajine meal in our own Riad was costing 15euros. To know that we had prepared the meal and had learnt how to cook the same at home was great - especially as the recipes were also given to us.A great break from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech!"

We were part of a group of 8 and we received a high level of service from when we arrived.

I bought some of these which were reasonably priced and we did not feel obliged to buy anything, this is because we chose to. We were given the recipes we were going to cook to take home and the kitchen was extremely well kitted out. The dada made bread with us, we then went on to make our own chicken tagine and salad. Later we were served the food we made in the restaurant and also had dessert, although we did not make this.

My partner and I are both big foodies and love cooking so it was always part of our plan while visiting Marrakech to take a Moroccan cooking class. We had an idea of which one we would do (from Lonely Planet guide) but found it was all booked up for the week we were in town, so we looked online and found this one. I was cautious at first as this particular course was quite a bit more expensive than the other half day courses we looked at. In retrospect, we don't regret one bit! It really is a fantastic place to learn to cook.We were welcomed into Le Maison Arabe and guided through the beautifully decorated hotel to the pool-side dining area, where we met our teacher, Mohammed (poly-lingual). We sat down for 30-40 minutes while he explained the basic concepts to Moroccan cooking and guided us through the recipes we'd be cooking. Next Mohammed took us into the kitchen (fully kitted out for 10 students - although it was just the two of us in our session - low season), we cooked along with the chef as they showed us how to prepare each part of the dish (chicken tagine with aubergine starter). After we'd finished we were seated next to the pool again and served our food with 3 fantastic Moroccan wines. At the end we were given recipes cards and a terracotta tagine each to take home.I can't recommend this course highly enough. If you're willing to spend a little more money than you would at some of the other schools then this is definitely the one for you."

The workshop starts with a brief history of Moroccan food followed by a bread making demo where everyone has a go a kneading the dough, then off to the communal bakery then the hotels own spice shop for a cup of Saffron T and soft sales pitch/ spice lecture. This is pretty interesting and unlike everywhere else in Marrakech you don\u2019t feel pressured into buying anything, at the time I thought it was pretty expensive and if you want to buy spices to bring home I\u2019m sure you can get better value by haggling in the spice section of the Souk, we didn\u2019t bring any home due to Easyjet luggage limits but I\u2019ve just paid \u00a34 for a pinch of Saffron in Waitrose and wish I had now. After spice demo you head back to kitchen to start cooking, we did a chicken tagine with side dishes of aubergine and tomato mash and a pepper salad. My only criticism of the course was the cheap blunt knives but we coped.You finish cooking about 1pm and sit down by the side of pool where you are served what you have made plus you also get bread and a nice desert even though I cooked it, it was one of the best meals I had out there.Great cooking course and enjoyable lunch would definitely recommend."

One of the things my husband and I love about traveling is the opportunity to taste authentic local cuisine. The cooking class at La Maison Arabe was all that we\u2019d hoped for. Our instructor, Mohammed, began our lesson with a culinary history of the region before we began cooking, then patiently took us through the steps of making a delicious starter and tagine. He and his staff had a sense of humor, making the experience relaxed as well as informative. With our cooking completed, we were served our meals in the lovely restaurant by an attentive waiter. It was a great afternoon and one we can highly recommend."

I found the class in Maison Arabe through the internet but had my hotel book it for me when I had arrived in Marrakech.Mohammed, our teacher, was very friendly and spoke perfect English. His knowledge of Moroccan dishes was wast and it was interesting to listen to him go through the countries culinary history. When we left, he wrote down his email address and told us we were welcome to contact him if we had any questions about the food or other dishes. I did contact him shortly after I arrived back home in Iceland and asked for a tagine recipe and his answer was waiting in my Inbox the very next day!There were six of us in the class, three couples. And it was very relaxed and great fun. At the end of the class we all sat down in the restaurant and ate our own cooking and enjoyed a glass of wine and each others company. I highly recommend this class to any one that wants to learn the basics in Moroccan cooking!"

He then took us on an outing to a spice shop and a bakery where we saw the local residents bring their prepared bread for baking. The talk in the spice shop was really interesting and gave us a full insight into the spices and herbs used. We returned to the cookery school. This was beautifully laid out. Each student, 9 in all, had a stove, sink and work station. We prepared chicken with lemons and olives. Such fun and a pleasure to do. With this we prepared 2 moroccan cooked salads with a tomato cut into a flower. I never thought I could do such tasty and well displayed foods. After we finished, the hotel had laid a beautiful table for us to eat the food. My daughter and I are vegetarian so we couldn't eat the food we prepared but promptly a vegetable couscous was brought to us. The chef had also prepared a filo pastry desert to round off our meal. At the end we were given copies of the recipes. I had such great fun and whilst this course was not cheap, it was most enjoyable and worth every penny. I would highly recommend it."

But then again - can I cook? Greeted warmly by Mr. Mohammed at the door - one immediately \"feels\" the kitchen. Followed by an introduction to the history and sources of moroccan spices and seasoning. Then the actual cooking workshop begins. Mr. Mohammed thoroughly guides you thru the process. Explaining each addition of spice along the way. And while the food simmers on the hot stove - you get to sip tea and exchange pleasantries with Mr. Mohammed. But this wasn't just plain boring pleasantry believe me.Mr. Mohammed is someone who has a vast knowledge of the local cuisine. Speaks; breathe and talks food. Fluent in 4 languages. Travels extensively to further his field. And as you listen to him speak - you would feel his LOVE for food and cooking. And as to the lamb tajine? I licked the dinner plate clean !Is there hope for a hopeless miserable cook like me to whip up some lamb tajine by tomorrow? As Mr. Mohammed has said - there is always hope. AMEN."

Mohammed and Fatima (the staff that taught that day) were very experienced and knew a lot about the history, spices, and culture around Moroccan food preparation. After a detailed description of Moroccan cooking, we walked through the streets to see the local bread baking shop, which is a local who cooks all the bread for the neighborhood -- everyone brings their dough on pans to cook and pick it up later. Coming from New York, there's nothing to compare it to and it's hard to describe; this is something to see in person. Next we went to a spice shop which seemed to have higher quality spices than what we saw in the Souks. It was unclear whether prices were fixed or bargain-able here.After that we went back to the hotel where they had a very nice kitchen set up with multiple work stations -- one per person. Each step of the preparation was clearly described and explained, and help given if needed. We made a salad, Tajine, and dessert was provided. All were excellent (and not necessarily because of my cooking, but because of the help we were given)!I very highly recommend this as an excursion -- my wife and I almost cancelled other excursions we had already planned and paid for just to come back a second day!"

We were one of five couples doing the cookery course and I think everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.We started off around 10am and were met by our tutor / host and taken to meet the Dada (chef) in the kitchen - the next few hours were thoroughly entertaining, useful and educational. I can't quite remember the sequence but all in all we made some local traditional bread, made a pepper salad and an aubergine salad (my favourite) as well as being shown how to make a proper chicken and preserved lemon tagine.We went to a spice shop round the corner for a little talk about the main spices there, with the opportunity to buy some (though it didn't feel like there was any pressure to buy); we were also taken to a local bakery to see the local people bring their bread in to be baked - very fascinating. It didn't seem like we were very long in seeing both of them, maybe 45 minutes (not too sure).After some more cooking we sat down to enjoy the fruits of our labours and we felt that it had been a thoroughly worthwhile and enjoyable morning/lunchtime. Definitely recommended."

If you plan on going to Marrakech I would highly recommend that you plan on going to the Cooking School at La Maison Arabe. It is truly an experience that you will remember, particularly if you have Mohammed Nahir conducting the class. We learned how to cook Chicken Tagine, Peppers Salad and Zalouk Salad. After visiting a local spice shop to learn more about spices, Mohammed and his assistant took us through the preparation and cooking of the food. The nice part of having Mohammed was that he worked with you as if you were his close friend and gave information about the Moroccan culture and its relevance to the food. Very interesting.Following the cooking class, we went to an outside table in a beautiful setting where our food was served and Mohammed joined us. It was very enjoyable as we all talked about our experience and Mohammed continued to give us insight into the Moroccan culture.Since Mohammed is an instructor in English at the University, his English is excellent. He also speaks several other languages. If you are planning on a Moroccan Cooking experience, you should definitely consider La Maison Arabe and Mohammed. Be sure to request him. He is terrific and will add to your trip in a wonderful way. You should also know that he is in charge of classes during afternoons and on Sundays. My wife and I continue to correspond with Mohammed as have some of our friends who have taken his class. Once you meet him, you will be very fortunate to be able to say, \u201cI have a friend in Marrakech.\u201d"

The class lasted around 3 hours. At the end of the class they gave each of us a small tagine to take with us, one more thing to carry home, but a fun souvenir of our holiday in Marrakech. Since returning home, my wife has made the tagine recipe we learned, delicious.

He also acted as our guide at the spice shop where we were introduced to the owner who gave a very interesting presentation of the different uses for spices, some of which were quite surprising. We bought quite a hoard to take home, whilst the prices were good and the quality high it is easy to spend more than you imagine!After the shopping trip it was back to the school to finish our dishes. The chef made the experience very worth while and added some humour and fun that made it very enjoyable. We sat down about 5:30 to dine on our endeavours, surprisingly very good.

The course was superbly run by Mohammed and a lady helper . Mohammed was very helpful and informative and his helper who basically was there to teach the people that were doing the vegetarian tagine as the majority made the Chicken with preserved lemons and olives tagine. As well as the tagines we made two different salads and also had demonstrations of bread making and tea making. We also saw the bread being baked in the communal bakery and visited a spice shop where we had a very interesting talk about the different herbs and spices. I did feel that the Spice Shop was very expensive compared to other places I visited before and afterwards but there was no pressure on you to buy. Needless to say most of the group did buy things! Mohammed also gave us a talk about on Morroccan cookery and how to make Couscous - so different from what it tells you to do on the packet here!!! Since coming back I have contacted Mohammed and he has sent me the recipes for the Couscous and some others.If you are thinking about doing this course - do it. I am a very keen cook and I had such fun doing it and cannot wait to make the tagines at home. By the way not everyone on the course were keen cooks but they seem to enjoy it and especially eating what we had cooked afterwards. I know I should not say it but it was the best tagine I have ever tasted and the salads were also delicious. The hotel provided the pudding which was equally delicious and luckily quite light! It was also great value for money because you also are given a small tagine to take home as well as the recipes."

As I had planned for this class for a long time and researched La Maison Arabe and Moroccan kitchen before my trip my expectations were high \u2013 and I am glad to say, they were not only fulfilled but also in many ways exceeded. The people in La Maison Arabe are extremely nice \u2013 in addition to advising me on a proper class they provided me with tons of extra help and advice \u2013 up to helping me to arrange my logistics to Marrakech.The half day cooking class itself takes place in La Maison Arabes beautiful complex in the medina and it is worth mentioning that La Maison Arabe was the first restaurant opened in the old part of Marrakech, later frequently visited by celebrities like Winston Churchill. Cooking class is presented by Dada \u2013 a traditional Moroccan chef who has been working in LaMa for the last 10 years, and a translator. Our translator Mohammed was simply great \u2013 in addition of speaking perfect English (he is a university professor) and French he is also passionate about the cooking and Moroccan cuisine. Mohammed got as going with a short lecture on the origins and main characteristics of Moroccan cuisine. This was followed by a short walk to a local spice shop. Even though many people expected some heavy sales pitch, this was not the case at all. This was rather a short introduction to Moroccan spices, different spice mixes and about the ways to use them. And after that \u2013 if someone wanted to buy the spices \u2013they where given a chance to do that. Many people did so, as being a partner of LaMa the quality of the goods in this shop can not be doubted. After getting back to the hotel we went into the cooking class where each of us had a cooking station prepared. Over the next hour and half we cooked the most delicious Moroccan dinner \u2013 two starters and a great chicken tajine with preserved lemons. We were also given hints on the presentation of the food what was great. Dada and Mohammed where there all the way discretely checking what we were doing and if needed \u2013 helping us. Once the dinner was cooked we where seated in the terrace right next to a beautiful swimming pool where the waiters served each one of us with our own dishes. My compliments to the chef \u2013 the food was great, as was the company! As a nice touch to a great afternoon Dada gave each one of us a small tajine pot to take home with us. You will also get a printout of all the recipes, so no need to take notes during the course. Most definitely recommended to anyone interested in Moroccan cuisine \u2013 this was a highlight of my 4 days in wonderful Marrakech!"

The cookery school was well equipped, other than that the knives were a bit small for chopping and not quite as sharp as they might have been. There was a cook to demonstrate, and a leader who conducted the course in English and French, helping us with our cooking.Our workshop commenced with a talk about Moroccan food and its origins. In addition to the \"hands on\" food preparation and cooking, the day included a demonstration of bread-making, a visit to the nearby communal bakery, a visit to a spice shop, a tour of the hotel, and an explanation of how to prepare couscous.We prepared an aubergine salad, a tomato and courgette salad and a tagine of chicken with olives and preserved lemon, all of which we then ate for lunch by the pool along with bread and a dessert made for us.The workshop was pitched at beginners. At home I regularly prepare Moroccan salads, tagines, couscous, bread, etc., and didn't learn a great deal new. Nevertheless, it was great fun, good value at the price (which included a small tagine to take home though I suspect it was a second and not of good quality). Tthe others on the course seemed to get a lot from it, and I did find it helpful to have somebody to answer questions about the things I cook at home. I'd certainly recommend this as something a bit different to do on a stay in MarrakechPaul from London"

The cost of the workshop is \u00a350 per person and includes lunch (no wine) and a complimentary tagine. I would definitely recommend this to my friends who enjoy cooking and for a nice break from the exhausting nature of the main square and souks. On the back of the cooking workshop experience we also had dinner at La Maison Arabe. We would not recommend this hotel for dinner. The service was poor, it was very expensive (minimum \u00a360 pp with wine) and the food was not as good as other restaurants we tried in Marrakech.

Wow, what a location the out of town grounds that La Maison Arabe has, which you are propelled to via air conditioned MPV. The secluded nature, huge swimming pool and sense of exclusivity are incredible. It was built recently in an old style and is owned by a rich Italian who lives nearby. The location is special. As is the translator, an English professor from the local university who has a wonderful social grace and rare but excellent linguistics.Plus a well air conditioned kitchen on a day where it was pushing the mid 40s in Marrakech made this a great place to be in the sweltering heat. I am vegetarian and I made by far the best veggie tagine that I have ever tasted, and learnt a lot.I left though feeling dissatisfied. Was it the cook, who spoke very few words and only then in Arabic? That she paid little or no attention to what we were cooking and offered no advice - the translator was the person who was teaching us to cook, with no input from her? That she seemed more intent in the food she was cooking (who for, I have idea, as we were the only guests there!).Or was it the waiter who brought us our deserts and asked us to leave within 15 minutes, whilst making sure we knew that for 1600dhm, service is not included?I'm not sure what left me with a bitter taste but whatever it was, La Maison Arabe should know better."

Mohammed the sous chef and teacher was delightful and knowledgeable about all things Marrakech. He not only made the class lots of fun, but was extremely helpful with additional planning! The hands-on demonstration school kitchen was purpose built and the prettiest and most user-friendly of any cooking school I have attended.

We inquired to the owners of the Riad Clementine (the lovely riad where we stayed) about cooking lessons in Marrakech, and they recommended the cooking course coordinated by La Maison Arabe (a beautiful hotel). We were in Marrakech during the Christmas holiday and were thrilled that they were able to fit us into a class on Christmas Day. When we arrived at La Maison Arabe the morning of our class, they treated us and the others waiting to the take the course, to complimentary tea and snacks in their beautiful courtyard. There were 9 of us in total (I believe that 10 is the maximum), and we road in two seperate mini vans to the location of the class. The class is held at the hotel's country club, which is a short drive away from the old city. Our interpreter Mohammed (and essentially the instructor), was perfectly fluent in both English and French. Upon arriving at the country club, he gave us a brief introduction to Moroccan cuisine that was very informative. We then went upstairs to the beautiful (and extremely clean!) kitchen, and began cooking. There was a local woman who demonstrated the techniques throughout the lesson while Mohammed explained everything. It was a wonderful experience, and we all enjoyed feasting on our delicious meal after it was prepared (we learned to make a chicken tajine, a warm salad, and a dessert). Mohammed does an excellent job and was kind to email the recipes to us after the class. We would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Marrakech!"

This workshop is properly set up and run: La Maison Arabe is a gorgeous setting in the medina, and they have converted a large room for the workshop with I think 10 workstations, each fully equipped with gas range, sink and all the spices and equipment you will need. It is run by a professor of english (who also speaks fluent french and probably other languages) with genuine knowledge and passion for moroccan cooking. The session starts with a general chat about moroccan cuisine, techniques and spices. We then cooked a lamb tagine and moroccan 'salad' (cooked augerines and tomatoes), and while it was cooking, we were taken on a stroll through local markets and to a spice shop. I didn't buy my spices then but I later wished I had, as I found that I couldn't beat the prices they were offering. Then we returned and ate our cooking, served properly at a table in the al fresco restaurant. I learnt a lot, I think, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have read elsewhere that the lady that runs Souk Cuisine started out by attending this class. I would recommend it to anyone who actually wants to do the cooking rather than watching someone cook. 500d each if there are 3 people or more on the day."

We joined three other people for this class and had the absolutely delightful experience, under the watchful eyes of our instructors Azizi (sorry if that spelling is incorrect) and Mohammed, of each cooking a pepper and tomato salad, a chicken and olive tagine, and cinnamon orange slices. An added bonus was that we then got to sit down with our new found friends and enjoy the fruits of our labours in the quiet, peaceful grounds of the site of the cooking school. All aspects of the school and the presentation of the ingredients and utensils with which we were to work was very professional. The assitance we received from the instructors was so fantastic that who would have thought cooking could be so much fun! We would not hesitate to recommend this cooking class experience to all who visit Morocco and we plan to use the tagine we just had to buy in Morocco after the class, and the recipes from the class, many times over now we have returned to Australia."

I was the only person there that morning so had 1:1 tuition. I made hot pepper salad, chicken tagine and orange salad. The chef spoke good English as he had worked in New York for a while and we got on well although he was somewhat concerned at my chopping technique! It was a very well equipped teaching kitchen with a number of workstations. It overlooked the terrace and swimming pool. When my food was ready I could not believe how good it looked and the taste - it was like an explosion of flavours in my mouth! Having had tagines in different restaurants I hadn't been able to see what the fuss was about but having made one with incredibly fresh spices I now see the difference. The chef told me that to make tagines in bulk in advance, as is done in many restaurants, can only lead to a reduction in flavour.I would recommend having this lesson to anyone who loves cooking. Some people I was with did an overnight trip to the Atlas mountains, some went to the coast - this was my treat to myself. I am still cooking from the recipes I was given and using the (well sealed) spices I bought in Marrakech."

Being aware of the exceptional reputation of La Maison Arabe, and keen to further our knowledge of Moroccan cuisine, 3 of us enroled on the course.We received a warm welcome on arrival at the Riad, and were able to have a walk around and relax in the ante rooms while waiting for our transport, which took us off to their country club.We were greeted by our tutor for the day, Mohammed Nadir, who sat us down for an overview of Moroccan cooking & its key principles/ingredients over a cup of mint tea. This served to further increase our excitement of the culinary task ahead.Moving up to the well laid out spacious kitchen area, we met head chef, Lazziza, and her assistant for the day. Each of us had our own work surface, together with necessary utensils and ingredients pre laid out. It was straight in to preparation of a lemon chicken tagine, Moroccan cooked salad and orange salad to finish. The whole process was thoroughly enjoyable, taking around 2 hours, with step by step demonstration and instruction.The grand finale, and most eagerly anticipated part of the day was sitting down at a table for 3, where we were served up our individual creations for a private lunch. Wine was an optional extra, and most welcome. I must admit, in my 10 days in Morocco that meal was the best I had!We thoroughly enjoyed our morning and all took away valuable tips, which will certainly be used in the future. Though on initial research not being sure of the slightly high price, none of us were disappointed by the service we received and the fantastic surroundings our morning was spent in. Moreover, our host Mohammed was vastly knowledgable gentleman who was not only an able cooking tutor, but was able to satisfactorily answer many of our other questions on Morocco."

Marrakesh: La Maison L'Arabe Cooking SchoolDate: 13 November, 2008.Reviewer: Suzanne - Melbourne, Australia.I travelled to Morocco in September with 7 very good friends. As the nominated travel planner, I included a cooking class at La Maison L'Arabe. We stayed downtown at \"La Maison\" and were transferred to the outskirts of town to the hotel's private annexe. This is a walled oasis of lush gardens with a swimming pool and the Cooking School. By the day of the class, we had some idea of the dishes that were the basis of Moroccan cuisine. We were given a choice of dishes for our class. We had also succumbed to the charms of the wonderful ceramics used to cook and serve these dishes. We were all set to learn the basics and transfer this knowledge to our own kitchens.Mohammed, who is a University professor of English, manages the school and accompanies the class. The kitchen is beautifully set up with individual stations for the students. The \"dada\", or traditional cook, guided us through the skills of preparing and cooking Moroccan salads, meats and fruits with the appropriate Moroccan spices, herbs and accompaniments. The dishes were not difficult, they were an introduction. More complex dishes involving the local pastries and dishes for festivities could be learned with additional classes. For our requirements (and skill levels) this class was ideal. Recipes are available by request on email, communication has been very efficient.While waiting for lunch to be served, we enjoyed the company of Mohammed who, in answer to a myriad of questions, gave us much information on the history and culture of this ancient, colourful country. I am sorry he will not be with us next weekend when we have our first Moroccan dinner party and serve our lemon chicken with olives in our gorgeous targine."

During the last day of our Moroccan tour, we spent a lovely afternoon at the Maison arabe's garden estate, located just outside the old city of Marrakesh. The beautiful grounds and pool provide a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the medina. Inside the spacious and gorgeous house, we had an enjoyable, hands-on Moroccan cooking lesson with Mohammed, our talented chef and teacher. Not only did we make a delicioius chicken with preserved lemon and olive dish, we got to eat it for lunch! It was certainly one of the more memorable moments of our trip. We left relaxed, with full bellies and recipes to take home. I would strongly recommend this experience to anyone interested in learning more about Moroccan cuisine and culture."

There are a maximum of 6 students in each class and the pace was very easy going.Once we had the salad and tagines prepared we had time to enjoy the grounds and explore the wonderful gardens before eating the lunches we had prepared.My husband who is a novice cook enjoyed the session and learning the different skills. I very much enjoyed learning about the different ingredients and meals but I am a much more adventurous cook and did feel that I would have liked to have learned more. One of the ladies peeled and chopped most of my vegetables for me so all I really had to do was put everything in the tagine and add the spices. I think this is an excellent session for beginners but maybe not for the more adventurous. However we did learn lots about what to look for in a tagine and have come home with 2 ready to amaze all our friends."

There, we met up with Mohammed, a very nice english teacher and translator for the local cook who showed us how to make a real Marocan tagine and salad. Though not very difficult to make, it was very, very tastefull and inspired us to buy a tagine in the medina and take it all the way home with us (heavy, but it arrived in one piece!)I would really recommend taking this course; it gives you a real 'taste' of Marrakech."

Mohammed gave us a background to Moroccan cooking (and gave us notepads and pencil to write it down if we wanted). Then we went up to the kitchens - amazing! - where he and his assistant Aziza showed us how to make a Moroccan salad and a tagine of lamb with figs and walnuts. The teaching was excellent - and so was our food - with the help of Mohammed and Aziza - which was served to us once ready on the terrace under the shade of a tree. I did the morning's course with a friend so it was great to have so much attention with just the two of us and feel able to ask lots of questions. Mohammed also told us where to buy all our spices in the covered spice market. I am definitely going back to learn to cook more things next time I'm in Marrakech!"

Here, we each cooked a Moroccan feast under the expert guidance of a lead instructor and two chefs, who monitored our progress every step of the way. The potentially scary part was eating our creation for lunch (in a magnificient courtyard garden), which turned out to be less daunting and more exhilirating than we had imagined. I for one am not ready to give up my day job just yet, but I can see myself experimenting often with gourmet recipes and enjoying my labors in the kitchen as a result of my experience at the Workshop. Particularly noteworthy was our warm and gracious lead instructor, Mohammed Nahir, whose knowledge and stories of Moroccan cooking, spices, customs, history and the region kept us enthralled for hours. Thank you, Mohammed, more than we can say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

He was informative about the cooking and about the country and culture in general. I wish I had known he served as a guide prior to my last day there as I believed he could have added a layer to Marrakesh that would have deepened the experience.Although our group thought the class was private class, we quickly forgot this concern because the quality of the class was so high and because Mohammed was such and interesting and great host.I would highly recommend."

Their review of the experience was glowing, and we were not disappointed.Roundtrip transportation from La Maison Arabe to their off-site location is easy (and included in the price of the course). After several twists and turns through the city, you find yourself in a beautiful garden setting. La Maision Arabe certainly spared no expense in the design and finish out of this property.We were met by Mohammed and commenced our day over mint tea with a general discussion of Moroccan cuisine and the spices used. Based on our interest, he walked us through the process (and dictated from memory the exact recipe) for making traditional couscous and seven vegatables. I cannot wait to try it out.Our class consisted of just my wife and me and focused on the preparation of taktuka, a \"salad\" of tomatoes and green peppers, and a tajine with chicken, preserved lemon and olives. (I understand that if you prefer to learn a particular dish, you can make arrangements in advance.) Ingredients are neatly laid out at your workstation when you arrive (although laid out nicely, nothing is pre-prepared - you chop, dice and slice everything yourself). After a brief introduction to what lay in store for us, Mohammed set us to work. Each step was explained clearly and we were given ample time to execute to task at hand. Given the differing preparation times, you bounce between the salad and the tajine. After the salad was complete and our tajines were cooking away, we went outside into the garden to take down the recipe for what we had just cooked. Mohammed is very interesting so I would encourage you to take the opportunity to chat with him about Morocco, Marrakech and life in general.Once everything is ready, you are taken to a table where a waiter serves you the meal you prepared. Since the weather was nice, we ate in the garden - just lovely.If you love to cook or just love to eat, this course is a fantastic way to spend half a day in Marrakech. (For those who fear the kitchen, there is no need to worry. The structure of the course is such that it moves at your pace. It is a pressure-free way to roll up your sleeves and to discover your \"inner chef\".)The cost of the course at MAD 1'600 (roughly EUR 140) for a two-person course is certainly not cheap, but well worth the cost for the quality of the experience and the food. Note that the per person cost declines with each person added to the course (I believe to as low as MAD 500 each). Beverages are not included in the price."
