Pass on Margaret Bridge and in the middle of this bridge you find the way to Margaret island. While passing by you will notice a very tall bronze monument and further down you cannot miss the dancing water fountain which is very similar to Bellagio fountain of Las Vegas but obviously much smaller. At particular times you can watch this water fountain dancing to the synchronized music both in the morning and during the evening. In the evening the water fountain is lit up with numerous lights. Have a stop at the kiosk nearby and order some hot tea (without milk) which is really good and tasty. you can hire a bike or an electric classic car and go around the island. You'll find a nice park, a garden, a mini zoo and other attractive monuments. The area is very quite but at the time we were there some construction work was going on."

Everyone seemed to be strolling round the Island and there were a range of activities. You could also hire electric cars or bikes and there was a land train going round the island. My favourite was the fountain where music was played through loud speakers and the fountain was synchronised to the music, brilliant old fashioned entertainment."

I suspect this is to do with the ongoing building & renovation works going on but nevertheless, it is a lovely place to while away a sunny afternoon. You can hire bikes, tandems, pedal carriages (seating up to 5) & segways. There is 1 casino, 2 hotels, 2 cafes & an outdoor street food vendor (try the Langos and fresh lemonade, they're divine). The water fountain plays on the hour for approx 10mins to music. The running track is approx 5k and always packed with runners, day and night. You can visit the island either by walking along the bridges, or via the river cruises which drop you off & collect you at different times throughout the day."

When we were there unfortunately there were large parts of the main road under construction / being renovated, but even the construction's dust and noise couldn't hide the beauty of the island. It's small, but feels like it envelopes you with trees, grass, and quiet. The fountain deserves its own paragraph; we had just missed the musical show (happens once on a round hour), and decided to take a seat and have a picnic while we wait for the next show. Even though it was literally an hour's wait sitting and doing nothing, the musical routine at the end was completely worth it. My tip : watch it after dark. Very romantic."

There are two hotels and at the northern end, there is an old chapel, and the ruins of a nunnery; for the rest it is pretty much untouched.

We arrived onto Margaret Island the first time to be greeted by the Musical Fountain just starting up which was nice. The definite highlight of the island for us though has to be the Palatinus Bath, it's fantastic! If you're planning a trip to the baths, be sure to look out for the free mini shuttle bus that goes to and from the baths. It is situated near the entrance to Margaret Island. It goes every 30 mins and is driven by a lovely local man. We timed it perfectly on both visits and managed to get the shuttle to and from without any waiting around. It was so helpful as the walk to the baths would be around 25 mins probably. The baths themselves have a great mix of pools including a wave pool, lazy river, thermal pools, serious swimming pools and there are also some slides which are a lot of fun. We spent hours here relaxing and dotting between the different areas. We favoured the Palatinus Bath over any of the other baths in Budapest and we made the right decision. On both occasions the baths were not too busy and you never had to queue for anything, including the slides. Would thoroughly recommend visiting Margaret Island and the Palatinus Bath! You could spend a morning or afternoon here quite easily or even a whole day."

At 2 pm, several popular songs were played on the speakers as the fountain was choreographed to the music. It was very pleasant to enjoy on a nice day. There were many families in the park enjoying the fountain and the day. There was a very clean public WC available."

I usually write very positive reviews, so perhaps we were very tired after a long day traveling around Buda, but when we got off the tram and wandered into Margitsziget (Margaret's Island) we had hoped for some peaceful areas where we could take a break from the hustle of the big city and enjoy nature. What we found were an amazing amount of joggers constantly doing a round-the-island jogg. Now this is hardly a bad thing in itself, but it seemed overwhelming when we made our first visit on the island. It was difficult to walk around the island and hardly accepatable to walk on the jogger's soft surface path that dominates the coastal walk area. So, somehow this became a less pleasant experience. As I said, perhaps it's my own fault - I was tired and had dreamed of a place for contemplation - a peaceful sanctuary. In fact, perhaps there are such places on the island... we did not stay long enough to find out, but there needs to be a balance between the sports people who enjoy this island and those who wish to enjoy nature - at least in my estimation!"

Whenever we are in Budapest and we get a nice day, we take one of the yellow trams to the last stop on the Pest side then walk half way across the Margeret Bridge and walk to the right along the entrance to the island. Just inside the park is the singing fountain which performs (I think) on the hour so try to time your entrance.We usually take advantage of a nice day to shop for a picnic at the Central Market before going to the island. There's a tram stop just outside the main entrance of the market to the left. Then, on the island, we walk most of the way along the river, counter clockwise along the path, then cut into the park and walk about half way back to find a bench to sit and have our picnic, but there are several small cafes within the park, and a bathroom which has a small fee.You can also rent bicycles or an electric or peddle cart, but walking is nicer."

You can walk around or get a golf cart, or a bike (tandems including 4 people bikes). There is a small zoo, beautiful dancing fountain. I spent about 4 hours walking around and enjoyed every minute of it. Kind of reminded me of Central Park, only it was in Budapest. Although there are not too many options you can have lunch there. I got a sandwich and set on a bench near the fountain. Definitely worth visiting."

We visited for a few spare hours after checking out from our hotel.We took the public ferry over to the island from the Pest side and then walked back over the bridge and caught the number 2 tram back.If you only have two to three days in Budapest, I wouldn't really say this was a not to be missed attraction, however, if you do have time or just want a couple of hours relaxing in lovely parkland, then this is where to go. We went on a beautifully sunny, very warm September Sunday. It was very busy with locals, chilling, walking their dogs, cycling, going to the swimming pool etc. During the week I assume would be quieter.It is a real family friendly place. As well as plenty of bicycles, including tandems and what I believe are called four people Surrey bikes, there are smaller versions of the same for quite young children. Plenty of means to get around. Of course you can walk, but as we were short of time, and it was very warm, we walked only a little and then hired an electric golf buggy for an hour. This allowed us to get all around the island. Ok it wasn't cheap at about 16GBP, but it was a means to an end for us with limited time. The bikes etc would be much cheaper.We enjoyed the dancing fountains, which are straight ahead of you when you get off the ferry or if you use the bridge to walk over, they would be within a very short walk in front of you, at the Southern end of the island. The fountains dance to music every hour on the hour. We caught two performances whilst there.A pleasant place to visit either as a couple or as a family. If you use the pool and visit the little zoo, I guess you could spend a good deal of the day there, but for a quick look around, have lunch/ afternoon snack and watch the fountains, I would say 3- 4 hours. We only had two and half hours, so the golf buggy was helpful and we didn't sit down for a snack, we just picked up a drink from one of the mobile carts."

At 12 noon we had a real treat at the central fountains. A synchronised water show accompanied with classical music was a real crowd drawer.

There are interesting ruins from the 1500s of a convent built as part of a pledge by the king. He promised to build a convent and send his daughter Margaret there if the Huns left Budapest. The Huns were forced out and there's no information on how 11-year old Margaret felt about her part of the deal.

However, on the island we stumbled across the Palatinus, an outdoor water park that wasn't over-crowded even on a hot day, clean and well accommodating. The water is somewhere between 30-32 degrees, there's free lockers - will let you figure them out ;).

Besides the endless maze of walking trails, and the great views of the city on either side, there are several small little destinations within the park: a small Japanese garden, a tiny zoo (inhabited by rescued animals), musical fountains, old ruins.The island is home to several athletic buildings as well: the Palatinus water park, the Hajos Alfred athletic pool, tennis facilities etc."

I was there in the summer and in the winter and both times was memorable. In the winter you can have a glass of hot wine to warm you up. And in the summer a Ice cold local beer. Summer time would be the best time to visit because everything is green and there is a lot of space to have a private pick-nick just pack a basket and you're all set just get a nice spot on the grass under a tree.If you are a sports fan you can run on the track that surrounds the park with a lot of points of interest along the way.You can get there by Bus also."

If you have ever been there, it has the feeling of New York's Central Park--joggers, cyclists, kids' playgrounds, food vendors--you name it. The only difference is that it is on an island in the middle of the Danube. We spent a couple of hours sitting on a bench, drinking soda and watching the world go by. Loved it."

While on holiday you try to do as mush as possible so I decided to take my family here just to slow down for a while. There are lots of things to see here including the lovely fountain, gardens, I think that there is a small zoo here too. We hired a four seat bike for an hour! My sons aged 16 and 21 thought it was great and took it in turns to do the steering, while my husband and I were on the back - which worked out well because we took the opportunity to stop peddling when we could so our sons did all the work!"

Well worth devoting a day to visit, this little island has a dedicated running track round it's perimeter (which gets quite busy), a hotel and health spa, gardens, a concert venue and restaurant, historical buildings and a small water park, which is centered around the natural spa - so take your cossie! You can hire cycles or pedal driven buggies to get round the island or just take a nice stroll and relax for the day. We traveled there by sightseeing boat which gave us the opportunity to see the main sights of the city from the river and runs at 90 minute intervals throughout the day, so once you are on the island you can stay as long as you like. If you have a transport pass for BKK you can use it on their water taxis or buses to the island too. Nothing seemed to be violently expensive, though on a nice day I would consider taking a picnic as there are plenty of areas that would make a nice venue for one on the island."

We didn't do much to be honest but soaked up the sun, bought pizza and beer from a kiosk, took a noddy train (1000 huf each) around the island, went on the swings and dipped our feet in the musical fountain. It was too much for much else! With a city full of flats/apartments, like other large European cities, the public outdoor spaces are excellent. There were lots of tourists here, but equal numbers of locals off to the pools, riding bikes, waking and picnicking. If we'd had longer (and the temperature been a little lower!) I'd have loved to do them all! I can't review this without talking about the musical fountain. Located by the Magrit bridge entrance it plays a choreographed fountain routine (to music) on the hour every hour. The music varies each hour and crowds gather to watch. On a hot day, sit by it and dangle your feet in as you watch. Bliss."

We couldn't even find somewhere to hire bikes! So if you're looking to go as a group of friends to chill or relax in the woods then would 100% recommend, otherwise maybe give this island a miss."

We bought sandwiches and drinks before going over and found a great spot to have a picnic near the fountain. There are so many beautiful spots to choose from. The fountain plays music every hour timed with the water. There is a swimming pool for kids and a small zoo that is free. There were lots of sunbathers, families, and joggers. You don't feel like you're in the city and can rent all kinds of bikes, scooters, etc if you don't want to walk. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for at least half of the day to chill and relax."

Chances are high for you catching a performance as they play on the hour and each performance seems to last about 15 minutes. We caught performances on both our way on and off the island. We arrived and watched the performance, along with lots of adorable toddlers who were visiting with their nearby playschool.The island also has a tiny zoo you can look around where there were some deer and horses. We were also lucky enough to catch a bird feeding her young, which was pretty adorable.The islands water tower is a point of attraction on the island. It was built in 1911, in a very funky art nouveau style. We stopped at the base, where there is a bar, and had a break with some well earned beers.Around the park were dotted various stands selling ice creams and various food items and we ended up stopping for some pretty amazing burgers and hot dogs."

The island itself is fantastic and caters for all tastes ranging from the super fit (running track right round the island) through the to the slightly less energetic (quad/side by side cycles) through to us (electric car). Lots to see for kids with a small petting zoo & beautiful musical fountain. There is a wonderful open air water park and for around \u00a320 for a family of 2+2 seems pretty good value. There is a bus service that runs 26 (226) from just outside the hotels and is pretty easy to use. The initial trip will cost you 450 HFT (price of a single journey) but as soon as you can go to a main train station and but a book of tickets 10 for 3000 HFT or even a travel card. To link in with the hop on hop off buses take the bus Nyugati Railway Terminal (last stop) stand with the main end entrance to your back and the buses are on the other side of the road. If you want to link into the metro then go in opposite direction to \u00c1rp\u00e1d had and link in there (it's quicker from the hotel stop). Some of the hop on hop off buses stop at the island so you can join/leave from there but they do get busy.There is a sightseeing river bus from the island as well as a river bus that costs 750 HFT per trip (I am guessing you could buy block tickets if thats your thing).Do try to watch for the floating bus (assuming you don't use it) as it's quite a sight watching it drive into the river and then float happily down river towards the house of parliment."

We chose the bicycle. It takes a good hour to cycle round and properly see everything, and probably a couple hours to walk. The zoo isn't really worth seeing, although would probably be nice to take small children."

We caught a tram to Margaret Island located in the middle of the Danube River in Budapest. No cars are allowed on the island which is mostly level. The island is a sanctuary with beautiful trees and bird life. We decided to catch the train on wheels around the island for our sightseeing tour. We then walked on the paths through the park to the Danubius Grand Hotel where we had a relaxed lunch on the veranda of the hotel. Zoltan had purchased bus tickets which took us back to the main entrance of the island and into Budapest. We connected with a tram for two stops to return to the hotel. We highly recommend this tour as it is a very nice way of taking in Margaret Island and at the same time not too far from the city hotel."

It has a running track made of astro-turf all the way round it, It has hotels with access to thermal waters, Japanese gardens, terrapin pools, musical clocks, musical fountains, a tower to climb to get good views for a nominal fee, swimming pools, small children's visiting zoo, cafes, restaurants, it is the place to go on a Sunday when the weather is good, or a holiday day off.. The musical fountan is a must, as is the ice cream made by the vendor close to the musical fountains. It looks like an ordinary ice cream stall, it is though spotlessly clean and the ice cream is the best you will taste in the world. I aleays have reservations about buying ice cream from a stall, is it shilled enough, is it stored correctly, beleive me you will have no worries. We oreered two scoops and when we had finished we ordered two more, (and we are not ice cream fans as a rule) You can get a ferry from here up and own the Danube, hire electric buggies, pedal bikes, pedal powered carts to hold a whole family, go on a land train, or just meander around the park to your hearts content. Cars are not allowed to drive around the park unless they are going to a shop or restaurant. You can though drive to the island and park. This is great relaxing day out."

You can access the Island from the bridge. It was a beautiful day when we went, which helped! We saw the fountains first, great, we saw the Water Tower, the Japenese Gardens, the Musical Fountains. The Island has lots of greenery and is treated very much as (because it probably is) a Park by Tourists & Islanders alone. It's very beautiful. There are are lots of kiosks/cafes to get a beer and some street food. Theres an athletic stadium and swimming pools. There is public transport on the island, buses, or you can hire cycles, peddle cars or engine \"cabbies\" (a bit like the electric caddies they use on golf courses. All we did (apart from eat & drink) was free. Obviously there is a charge for bike etc hire but we didn't check."

The island is situated in the middle of the Danube and is about 15 minutes walk from the Parliament Building, so not far from the main sights.A stunning park area that is a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of Budapest. The day we visited it is 84 degrees, there was a lovely breeze across the island so it was brilliant just to stroll and relax. The island has a 5k track around its edge that is popular with runners, this gives you an indication that the island is large.At both ends of the island there are dancing fountains that perform every hours to a wide variety of music. The free shows are around 20 - 30 minutes are are well worth seeing, there are lots of chairs nearby. Would be well worth seeing at night when the fountains are lit.Outside of this there are rose gardens, park areas and tree lined areas to wander and relax. Well worth a visit to chill out."

The fountains are fun to watch + surrounded by seats and the water dances to recorded music that is played. There are snack stands around too, but they are not value for money. There is a mini train you can take to get an overview (with recorded commentry) but you can also take regular bus through the park.

I needed a restful day last Monday in Budapest and took the tram and bus to get onto Margit sziget, walked the many paths and read in the shade before continuing on to discover the little zoo where I was completely overjoyed to find not only storks (feher golyas), but baby storks! There were 9 or so adult storks wandering about, doing stork things (including an interesting mating thing where they clack their beaks rapidly), and in the center area 3 nest boxes where I watched 2 chicks being fed by their mother. I love storks (can you tell?!) so this was actually very exciting and a highlight of my trip to Budapest. There are gardens, a church and monastery ruins as well, plenty of paths for walking, bike riding or jogging, and pay toilets here and there."

There are many other things to do like ride bikes or other various vehicles. When we visited last summer, I went with my extended family. We rented a thing called a bringo cart. They are fun and moderately paced bike like vehicle to pedal around the island. We went and visited everything on the island during our 2-3 hour stay there. The things we enjoyed the most-the Japanese Garden, the the water tower, the mini-zoo with unique animals, the rose garden, and the dominican ruins/old church. There is also a musical fountain that has a show every hour that plays different songs. You can find the website and they will detail which songs will be performed every hour. The food on the island is good too. We got a massive stick of cotton candy (twice the size of my wifes head) for the equivalent of $1.25 american.

The city is beautiful, but if your eyes want a break from endless rows of architectural wonders and enjoy some greenery and space, Margaret Island is the place to go. It is accessible by foot over the bridge or by boat. I'll recommend the bridge as it is a good walk that offers a great view of the river and both banks of the city. There's a musical fountain that's great to relax and enjoy, and nice shaded paths right by the river where you'll see lots of joggers running past."

I would highly recommend renting one of the amusing bikes that you can hire. for \u00a38 per hour you can peddle around the island and see the whole thing. This attraction is good for everyone. Families can visit the little zoo and couples can peddle around in a little car bikeand friends can zoom around in a 4 or 6 seater bike and there is loads of grass spaces where you can sit to relax or enjoy a picnic in the sun."

There are also several stands with food and bike rentals. However, it still doesn't make the park to be full of things to do.The big disappointment of this park is that it gets clean only by rare natural floods than by people. Almost everywhere you can find disgusting cigarette butts.

The park has a a new rubber running track thats 5.35 kilometers (3.33 miles), that wraps around the park. I initially visited the park to use the running track but to my delight I found other interesting features in the park that I enjoyed and I'm sure you will too.There is a well-manicured Japanese Garden and old ruins in the park that were nice, I will go back with my 'real' camera to photograph these.Oddly, there is also a backpackers in the park, I could imagine that this place is fun at night for the backpackers staying there! There is a free Zoo that I wandered through, there a very large bunnies (maybe hares) that are cage-free, which is nice, however there is a large Eagle, which was kind of sad to see, as such a large bird with large out-spanding wings seemed out of place in a small enclosure :( There are ponies and deer that are very healthy and seem happy, one cute pony had it tongue out and was very friendly so I stopped for a quick pat and a selfie.Perhaps one of the best things in the park is the Lokshe (large traditional Donut with sour cream and cheese or nutella). I stopped at the cafe as I noticed people eating these. I ordered the traditional donut with sour cream, garlic and cheese. I suggest sharing one as they are HUGE!! Next time I'll get the Nutella. This was a really nice surprise as I'de been looking to try this large traditional donut but had not come across one yet.The view of Parliament and Pest is quite nice from the park as well. Pack your walking shoes (sneakers) and a camera. The islands and park is dog-friendly which is great for me as my dogs come to Budapest from Los Angeles next week.Happy walking- don't miss the huge donuts! PS. The park is free so a great way to spend an afternoon for those on a budget."

Firstly there is a running track that goes around the whole island which is 5.5km long and many people use it, and its not hard to see why you get a great panorama of the Danube line of houses and buildings here of both sides of the Danube, its great for peaceful walks of all ages. There are large green areas, flowery gardens, old trees, and lots of entertainment and of course food and drinks. The island\u2019s include a number of walking paths, medieval ruins, a small zoo, musical fountain (cant miss it, very popular), a water tower, swimming pools, a water park an open air theater and cinema. So there is certainly no shortage of things to do here.I do recommend to rent a bike everyone does and just ride around the island for an hour or so and take in the beauty of it, there are group bikes as well that can seat multiple people, its great fun, and certainly my favorite thing to do.FYI: The best way to get to the island is by tram 4 or tram 6 and get off at the Margit h\u00edd Budai h\u00eddf\u0151 stop"

In summer time the island is relatively cool, there is an excellent swim and waterpark (Palatines) in the middle of the island. Easy to reach by walk (can be a little bit far som some), by bus or city-bicycle. No private cars are allowed otherwise. Especially nice is the fountain at the downstream end which works / \"dances\" with music in the summer time. There are several places to buy drinks, food, snacks and ice-cream. Electric cars and family bicycles can be rented for a reasonable price. It is very possible to just stay at the island with a book and a big towel and just chill out under a tree on the lawn - totally free."

Located in the middle of the Danube this island is connected to Budapest by the Yellow Bridge or Margaret Bridge. It's named after Margaret, the Hungarian princess, who lived here as a nun in a Dominican convent. The ruins of the church and the convent render a desolate appearance. St. Margaret's shrine is a much visited site here. The Island can be explored by hiring battery driven cars or by a train carriage type ride. There are large gardens all so green and serene. We passed by the luxurious Grand Hotel. There are athletic centres and a well maintained jogger's track. This track runs parallel to the Danube and to walk down the track is a very pleasant and refreshing experience. We took the bus service to get back to Margaret Bridge and returned to Pest by a tram."

It\u2019s a city that merits a longer visit, but if you're just there for a short visit, a must see places are Margit Hind, Castle Hill, Chain Bridge (Szechenyi lanchid), Heroes' Square, Gellert Hill and Statue, Parliament (Orszaghaz) , 300-foot dome of St. Stephen's Basilica.

Their are Japanese gardens, children's player's, beautiful water tower, petting zoo, and just so much space enjoyed by visitors and locals alike.We did find a hut selling food and snacks by a completely miserable and totally disinterested young woman.

We choose the first option. There were many places where you could loan them, but to pedal with it wasn't so easy and after an hour we didn't travel very much. After this with sat near a very large fountain with very beautiful water plays that followed the music. The seats were nailed to the earth (probably in order not to make them stolen). therefore you couldn't move them, but after a while you became used to it and didn't care much.

Take the tram (2) to the edge of Margit Bridge and walk across to where it intersects with the Island in the middle of the Danube. On a sunny autumn day it was a delight to walk the 5k running track around the outside of the island well used by the runners and cyclists of Budapest. There are no cars which adds to the peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. In the centre of the island there are plenty of things to see and do (huge fountains, a musical well, a small petting zoo, ruined churches, a stunning Japanese garden, a water park/lido etc). There is a feeling of 'faded glamour' to some of the buildings which were closed in the autumn but this added to the atmosphere. Take a picnic and make it a priority!"

There is a sports facility, a couple of bars and restaurants a cinema and the 2 hotels at the northern end. Given that the island is about 2.5km long, this leaves a lot of open space, even allowing for the road connecting the Margit and Arpad bridges (at the south and north ends of the island (respectively). Note that the island is served by the 26 bus (Nyugati station to Arpad metro).My visit was on a morning in November. There were people around, but mainly joggers and dog walkers with a few bike riders (I understand that the island is a favourite place for local joggers). There is a good path running on the eastern side of the island used by the runners, but there are numerous others meandering through the park-like surroundings. There is a small mini-zoo, rather limited, but may be sufficient to keep young children diverted for a while. Also present on the island are the ruins of a convent. You can't miss the water tower, which is rather more attractive than the usual. At the northern end is a small chapel and a small Japanese style garden. There is a musical fountain, but there did not seem to be much action. Perhaps its still being restored."

The first interesting place we came to was the Japanese Garden. That was beautiful and we enjoyed spotting and watching the fish and the turtles swimming in the ponds. The trees were beautiful as the leaves changed colour and fell. There were little children having fun collecting leaves. The mini zoo on the island is also good for kids (of all ages). They have a few animals (deer etc) and quite a few birds. One enclosure holds a flock of silky chickens - about half black and half white. You can't help smiling watching them. A little further down the island I was pleased to see a small flock of nuthatches (one of my favourite birds) high up in the trees. I don't think I've seen so many at one time before. There were other interesting sights, leaving us to marvel at God's wonderful creation, and it seemed no time before we reached the bottom of the Island (even though it had probably been a couple of hours). The highlight of our walk though wa sthe musical fountain. We thought it was kids singing as we approached but it was music from speakers and the fountain was performing in time to the music. It really was impressive and my wife filled up her phone memory videoing it!"

Decided to visit Margaret island situated in the midst of the Danube river and approachable by the Margaret bridge built across the Danube connecting Pest to the Buda side embankments.Boarded a 6 Nos tram in Pest and alighted mid-way on the bridge tram stop and walked into the garden World of Margaret Island.St Margaret Island is 2.5 Kms long and 500 meters wide situated in the middle of the river Danube in Central Budapest.This island was dominated by nunneries,churches and cloisters until the 16 the Century when the Ottoman wars forced the monks to flee and the buildings were destroyed.In the 18th century it was made into a resort for the Palatines.It was declared a public park in 1908 and during the \"Siege of Budapest\" in World War II bore the brunt of war destruction and massacres.There were numerous young tourists and cycling was the craze in this unique natural island park of Budapest. Cycle hire charges were 1400 Ft for a hour and i was charged 1000 Ft for half an hour between 1300-1330 hrs. Explored this small cute island with the cycle as this was the safest place to cycle having negligible vehicular traffic .Didn't Irish Rock star Bono of \"U2\" get seriously hospitalized while cycling in Central Park in New York ? I was careful in my cycling speed as there were numerous cyclists as well as pedestrians with a occasional bus or vehicle making its appearance on the narrow park roads.Cycled around the small island and came across the beautiful crafted \"Japanese Garden\" which had a small pond with Koi and carp fish.The island has the Palatinus water park which is the largest open air swimming complex in Budapest.There was also a jogging track along the boundary of the river island having a foam rubber track.Cycling around discovered the landmark \"Water Tower\" built in art Noveau style in 1911 and today functioning as a look-out tower and a exhibition hall.There were statues of two huge dogs at the entrance of the Water tower.A real cute Island in the midst of the Danube river."

            "review": "The island in a golden autumn day. To go to Margaret Island today, was a very lucky decision .Probably this was one of the very last golden days of the fall, whose colorful robes made of autumn leaves were still in full glory, but the sunshine was a bit hazy already and the shivering pansies pulled themselves together in the flower beds. My steps were cushioned by fallen leaves, and the statue of the girl with the flute in front of the l ruins played the \u201eAutumn leaves\u201d. The Palatinus water park, that is so busy during the summer, now is abandoned, only a few people are waiting for the No26 bus what runs along the island in every 15 minutes. It starts at Nyugati railway station and goes through Margit bridge until \u00c1rp\u00e1d bridge.Margaret Island is a popular recreational area and being in the middle of the city it is easily approachable. In addition to the aforementioned Palatinus \u201cPala\u201d as the Hungarians are calling it, there is the Haj\u00f3s Alfr\u00e9d sports pool for the serious swimmers and a tennis court as well.During the summer evenings is a wonderful entertainment to go to the open-air-theatre. Most of these features are closed already (in November) together with the famous \u201cMusic Fountain\u201d. The landmark Water Tower is still open, only doesn\u2019t function as a water tower anymore, but as a lookout and an exhibition hall.If you\u2019re rich enough there are two hotels as well, but as you can guess, they aren\u2019t budget ones.Walking around I thinking about poor St Margaret after the island was named, and who lived most of her short 28 years life here. After the Mongol invasion her parents offered her to the God to save Hungary. At the age of three she went to the Dominican nuns and later was transferred to the convent on the Island of Rabbits, - currently Margaret island - built by her father. Margaret\u2019s vows took place here in 1254. Can you imagine? She was born in 1242, so took the vows when she was 12 year old. Not an enviable life for a princess.Admiring an old oak tree I think that perhaps it is one of whom Arany J\u00e1nos the famous Hungarian poet wrote about. \u201cI like to relax under the oak trees\u201d (sorry for the awful word to word translation)This island isn\u2019t only beautiful in every season, but full of history as well. If you want to rejuvenate your body and soul, visit Margaret Island."

The island itself has so much to offer everyone from a simple walk, a visit to the baths, rose gardens, musical fountain, small zoo and you can even stay in the hotel on the island.

We did a mini train trip, then had a bite to eat at a nearby snackbar, then rented a golf cart for an hour for about 3,900 HUF (with a cash deposit required of 10,000 HUF)..The hghlight for us, after the trip around the island, was discovering the musical dancing fountain which provided great entertainment on the hour every hour,Overall, this was a wonderful, relaxing afternoon."

One of the first things You will see is the large fountain, playing by the music.From there lovely old trees and beautifully maintained walkways, until You arrive at a gigantic garden full of flowers and comfortable benches. Around the water tower there is a fairly good restaurant, and the view from the top of the tower is very nice. There also is a small petting zoo for children, The ruins of the monastery where Princess Margaret daughter of the king lived her life..at about the 12th century.

I went there by foot (but there is also the tram line no. 4 and 6 for the laziest) and the place is a sort of green area where you can forget about buildings and their concrete, forget about cars and forget about stress. A natural place with some amusements, like the Music Fountain which perform a game of water together with music each hour. There it is possible to find also a small farm with some animals (even if they call it zoo, but the animals are not those you'd find during a safari though) or just jogging around and exercise in a big area full of trees and grass. The climate was perfect so I more than enjoyed it and I recommend the place to all those who are looking for relaxation or a natural place where to spend few hours of their time."

The island can be accessed by bus from the bridge or boat but no cars are allowed on the island. There is a little road train to take you a tour around the island or you can hire bikes or a golf buggy that looks like a small car. The musical fountain is impressive and worth waiting the half hour for if necessary. There are some small cafes and apparently a good restaurant but we didn't try it.

Plenty of places to walk, a huge expanse of grass lawn in the middle for picnicking. Quite an unexpected surprise to have such a space in the middle of all of the history and culture.

Having explored most of it, i realized it's more than that. It's a break from the city madness, a place you can go to relax- to read a book, to go with children and both have fun, to walk your dog, to people watch. I could definitely spend 3 hours there, even doing nothing since sitting underneath a thick canopy of trees is more relaxing than I thought it would be.Check out the Japanese garden- very pretty! Rose enthusiasts, you might want to check out the rose garden, on the way to Japanese garden.There are maps and signs throughout the island to help you navigate, and if everything fails ask the people selling food, etc.- they are very willing to help out. Also, you might want to rent a bicycle or a golf cart thingy (they work like bicycles) available at the entrance if you don't have much time yet want to explore the whole island because walking around when you don't have much time in your hands can be tiring and make you miss out on the relaxing vibes of the island. I wish to come back one day, especially for sziget festival since that must be even more awesome and you can realize it the moment you step on Margaret Island since the vibes are great."

Accessed via a spur from the Margaret Bridge. not far from the Parliament building. The spur leads you directly to the fountain, which on the hour from 1200 to 2100 I believe, is choreographed to music for 15 minutes. Sounds simple but it really is wonderful to see. Music played ranges from classical to pop/rock including The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel and Dire Straits. There is a rotation of 4 set lists and at 2100 the fountain plays for an hour, all 4 set lists being run back to back, combined with a light show. This really is something everyone visiting Budapest should see Did not visit the rest of the island but it looks to be a pleasant green oasis, various cycles and 4/5 seaters available for hire beside the fountain."

On our visit we hired a five person bike for one hour which made for some of the funniest moments of our trip to Budapest, its a great place to cycle round and there are lots of motorised or pedal power vehicles to hire at different points around the island. If you are in a larger group and want a bike that offers more than 3 seats you may find yourselves waiting as it can get quite busy but it is definitely worth the wait to do something different on your visit!"

My partner and I visited the island three times for the musical fountain, and the gardens immediately adjacent. Having looked at the map here on TripAdvisor afterwards, I am left wishing that we had decided to explore the entire island, rather than just the southern tip!We actually discovered the island completely by accident whilst walking over the yellow bridge looking for something to do for an hour before we ate dinner. We wandered over to the fountain, wondering what the crowd was there for. At about 18:10 nothing was happening, so we decided to leave it and move on. No sooner had we stood up, than the previously off fountain suddenly burst into life to the theme of \"Pretty Woman\". It begins with a 30 minute setlist at 11:00, with a further 20 minutes on the hour every hour until 21:00, where it plays the four 20 minute setlists consecutively as a lit-up show in the dark. After dinner, we came back for the lit-up show, and it was definitely worth the walk. The highlight for the both of us was Vivaldi's \"Four Seasons\", though Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\" was also definitely a memorable one. Like I said, it's not an attraction that immediately springs to mind, but you will not regret it if you decide to go - and you should."

In the middle, we stopped at an exercise part and played with the contraptions, then kept on going. At one point, we heard Scottish bagpipes and saw a local gymnastic dance team practicing in the ancient Roman Ruins. Very multicultural! ONE NOTE: Take a few notes for the bathroom, but keep the receipt as it's good for all restrooms on the island and also any member of the family."

You descend onto the island and the peace descends on you your 1st view forward is the fountain that dances some of the time to music. We were short on time but wanted to see the island so opted for a 1/2 hour road train tour of the island, there were other ways to go Cycle hire with varying styles of bike from single, tandem, and family style 4 wheel bikes, 4 wheel covered racing looking styles just for the kids, Segways, Motor stand up scooters and Golf buggies that you can hire in the style of an old car. As i said we opted for the road train and saw all the sites, The Monastery, Kids Zoo, Swimming pool outdoor japanese and conventional gardens Yes well worth a visit give it more time and take you swimwear."

If not for the fact that we had some time before dinner to spare, I doubt if we would have made a trip to this island in the middle of the Danube, as other 'must-see' sights took higher priority on our list of things to do and see in Budapest! As it turned out, it was one of the highlights of our stay in Budapest! This island is probably the most popular public city park in the city. Once there, you forget that you ARE in a city. It is very picturesque and serene with loads to see and do. It is so easy to spend half a day or more here. We chose to sit for an hour or so dipping our feet in the refreshingly cool water of the fountain with the locals while waiting for the next musical show of the fountain (complete with lights) to start. The show commences at the start of every hour. There are places to eat here ranging from cheap to expensive and free spring water from taps.The island is 2.5 km long and about 0.5 km wide so if you don't feel like exploring it on foot, you can take the frequent Bus 26 (payable or free if you already have a valid public transport pass) and get off at the various stops on the island to do the exploring. We liked it so much that we spent more than 3 hours here (dinner was forgotten!), just getting away from the heat of the day.To get here from the city center, take Trams 4 or 6 and get down at the stop which is on Margaret Bridge itself (there is only one stop on the bridge, roughly in the middle). From here, walk down to the island. The area is popular among sports enthusiasts as well and in the evenings, many locals come here to jog or cycle or swim."

We fed the ducks and fish in the Japanese garden (they have a machine that gives you special food for a really cheap price - 100 HUF). The gardens are well tended and the place is beautiful for a walk/ cycling tour. You can also jog here, as they have a special jogging track.We've only spent some time around 2 hours on this island but it would have been nice if we had more time.

We walked and it was nice, full of trees, but we didn't manage to see the whole island in an hour (it is 2.5 km long) but there is a possibility to rent a bike and that is something I will definitely do the next time I'm visiting the Margaret Island.

Once on the bridge, you can walk down to the entrance of the park. once there, you have a choice to walk through, take a bus, which goes through the park and has various stops, or take a cycle on rent to go through the place We decided to take the bus and use it as a hop on-hop off. Just be careful you get off on the last stop, as the bus will go through at the other end. The park has some nice restaurants and snack places, water park, vista points, historic buildings, musical fountain, a mini zoo, japanese garden etc. Primarily look at it as a place to relax.

Or, if you're up to it, play some ball game on the fields, it's very popular. The other funny possibility is to rent a bike-car (or whatever its name is) or a golf-car and drive around in those."

It was a very hot august, so we probably would have enjoyed walking on the parks even more, if it wasn't so hot! But I'd say it's worth a visit, especially if you live on a bustling street and need to get a breather and relax in some green environment."

You can rent a mini auto for a half hour or an hour at a very reasonable price, or you can rent a bike or pedal-car too. There are lovely gardens and a Japanese garden with ponds and turtles. There is a small (very small) petting zoo and you can feed the animals there, and the kids can ride on a horse too. There are ruins of medieval buildings, and there is a water park and a pool complex for serious swimmers / divers. In addition, there is a running / jogging track around the entire perimeter of the island. One of the most popular attractions there is the musical fountain. They play music while the fountain spouts water to the beat. There are also food stands at the various venues on the island. And there's more, too...a great place to spend several hours during the Summer in a veritable mid-city oasis of nature. We'd definitely go back again."

After spending a few hours in the very nice Palatinus water park, we hired one of the little electric cars to tour round the island. for the hire of the electric cars you must have your driving license with you, well worth it though as we had lots of fun on this, if your tastes are more in the way of pedal power then you can hire many different kinds of transport for the whole family to go in. all in all a lovely place to spend an afternoon or day depending on your program. the fountains as you enter the island from the Margaret bridge side are very entertaining to just relax and watch for a while."

At the first day I feels, like time was stopped, so deep peace fallen over me. Next day I enjoyed musical fountains. The best show starts at 9pm and lasts one hour. The beautiful dance of water and colours. The water tower is interesting too, but it's not very high. By the way, you can find there to do many things - cycling alone or with family, visit concerts or performances in the Open-air Theater, enjoy one of the best spas in Europe or have fun in the swimming pool or just jogging around the island."

The park is set on an island in the middle of the Danube and as there are no cars allowed its really peaceful. One of the main attractions is the musical fountain, which I was surprised to find really enjoyable. The park itself has several little areas, glades, where you can relax and and enjoy a picnic. There's an extensive network of footpaths through the mature trees to enjoy. There is also a small zoo, although we didn't enter it. There's a small stall selling light refreshments, hot and cold drinks. A great place to relax, take some time out, enjoy the music and the Dancing Fountain. Recommend"

The island is first and foremost the main park area in Budapest, accessible by the No. 26 bus which traverses the full one and a half mile length of the island. We enjoyed a quiet walk through the gardens late in the afternoon. But as others have said, not many toilet facilities, and in the Southern part of the island not much in the way of refreshment facilities either. Attractive gardens. But we visited the island also to see a concert in the amazing outdoor auditorium, which appears to seat well over 2,000 people. Budapest has a summer music festival through the summer and we booked the concert we wanted to see online via the Jegymester website - very easy and tickets not expensive. We saw a huge symphony orchestra and a big choir of 150 singers with ballet for two works by Carl Orff, including the famous Carmina Burana. Fantastic production. We were a bit concerned that we might have to walk the couple of miles back to our hotel after the concert (10.30 pm), but there was a fleet of public buses available at the end of the evening to get everyone off the island, specially organised. Very efficient!"

You can take the metro and it's about a ten/fifteen minute walk from there to the entrance to the island, or you can take the tram.

It was mid November and rather crisp and being from Florida we appreciated seeing the colors on the trees. Lovely hotel...Danubius Grand Hotel Margitsziget. Very quaint and absolutely European. The other hotel on Margaret Island is modern in appearance and is the one my son stayed at. We did not visit that hotel as the Grand Hotel, with its traditional ambience, was more of what we were looking for. Absolutely wonderful walking around the island and watching Xmas decor being set up. Highly recommend the island for a day tour or to stay."

Even if you are so enchanted you miss the last boat, you can take public transit off the the island. While you are on the island, there are attractions for all ages, interests, and abilities. There are jogging trails, bike paths, waterparks, and even a small zoo. Centuries old ruins harken back to the time when religious orders sought solitude for prayer and contemplation. Even earlier, the Island of Lepers provided solice to the afflected. The arts are well represented with performances and festivals. There is food for every taste or you can bring a picnic. A walk around the island gives you a wonderful leisurely view of the amazing riverfront sites of Budapest. You can spend as much or as little as you wish.

They are creating a new soft running track around the perimeter which should be nice when finished. Quite the retreat."

Margitsziget (Margaret Island) is a picturesque 5km (3.1miles) park route on a rubberized track route that traces the perimeter of the island. It's beautiful, flat and a popular spot for runners all obeying running rules and sharing the track (run on the right, pass on the left - easy to figure out and follow) so even at it's busiest times it is not hectic. The track is made of the same material as a stadium track, which is easy on the joints. Margaret Bridge is the main foot traffic and tourist access to the island. It is easy to find from both Buda and Pest sides, and has pedestrian and bike lanes so you can enjoy the scenic crossing of the Danube too.And if you need water, a WC or decide beer is more fun than running (no judgement here!), then you can stop at the several places within the park that offer food and beverage. In addition to Margitsziget, Budapest, is a beautiful city to run and/or bike. It's mostly flat and small enough that you can quickly become familiar with which city routes to take (and avoid) in order to have a great run or ride while enjoying the history and sites of the city."

I came here on the last day of my holiday, luckily on a scorching hot day and instantly loved this place. There's nothing nicer than seeing friends, families or couples just out enjoying themselves, be that with a Frisbee, playing football, enjoying a drink or just catching some sum. The tourist parts are of course the busiest, but have a walk around and you'll soon find lots of little spots that are a lot more private where you'll barely hear anyone for hours. There's lots to see and do in the park, from a zoo, a theatre, a casino and more than enough places to eat and drink. However the best part for me was the beautiful fountain at the entrance to the park. Every hour in the hour it has a synchronised fountain display to music, both popular tunes and classical. It's even lit up by a spectacular light show, but you can't see it in the day. Therefore after going back to the hotel and freshen up, we even came back here for 8.00pm to have dinner and watch the extended ( hour long ) fountain water and light display........so impressive was it, I'd say it was possibly the highlight of my trip to Budapest."

It was very impressive and amusing there were several small children watching bouncing up and down with glee. This was at 12 noon so I assume it may perform on the hour there is also a small zoo and St Margaret's tomb in the ruins of a convent.there is also an outdoor theatre and several swimming pools and lidos with slide set which looked interesting but very sad the day we visited as it was raining!"

Although the music was cheesy, watching the water dance in time to the music was fantastic. We then did the walk along the island to find the Garden of Rose and the Japanese Garden. Neither of these were really worth the walk to be honest. The lake in the Japanese garden was dried up and part of it was inaccessible due to construction work. If you have the time, the island would be perfect for a picnic, there are food stalls and resturants that look really nice. If you like running there is a rubber track that runs close to the water's edge."

At just over two and a half kilometres long, and after a 5- to 10-minute walk from either end of the island, it's possible to escape the crowds that arrived with you. Lots of folks come here to ride bikes, listen to a free concert, admire the fountains and flowers, or just use the swimming pools.

There are lots of places to eat, drink or snack. We finally got to eat a lanos here, a sort of fried dough pizza topped with sour cream and cheese. Wonderful, but more than 1 in a week and you'd end up waddling rather than walking around the city.The island is a super place with something for everybody and the perfect place to unwind.

We then walked the island stopping at the ruins of the Franciscan Church, the musical Bodor Well, the Japanese Garden, and enjoying lunch at the Water Tower.We had a lovely day, sun was shining and the living was easy.Highly recommended."

What we didn't like is that there are many construction works and some zones right on the boardline are fenced. It is not very convenient, and we were late for our boat just because we couldn't find the way through a line of the fence. There are way too many of them(( we couldn't find the beach, to spend some time on the river bank, maybe we were just unlucky, I don't know. You feel good inside, but the idea of the island is to see the river, isn't it? It's not prepared for that. There are several swimming pools and recreation zones, but we found them overpriced. Overall, a good experience with some minor minuses"

We went to the one near the casino and fountains but the service was very slow. There is also a swimming baths here with I believe more than one pool. A lovely place to relax on a sunny day.We also could have visited the island when on a boat tour, (Legenda) is one of the best, gate 7, I think.Passengers can get off the boat on Margaret Island and then get the next boat back.The boat tour was a pleasant way of spending an hour or so and seeing the sights along the river. It had seating inside and out, complimentary drinks were brought roundand there was a commentary on the buildings we were passing. It was a very clean well run boat."

We took the boat from the Pest side of the river to the Island and spent about 2 hours there. We rented Segway-type bikes and explored the island for about an hour. We also hired bicycles and rode around the park for around half an hour, before we sadly had to leave to get the boat back. You can also rent little pedal cars for 4 or more people. The weather was brilliant (a sunny 27 degrees) and the place looked like it was full of locals who come here for picnics, to walk their dogs or to jog around the race track. There is a fee to use the bathrooms, and the lady was quite rude. I was so surprised to find such a lovely outdoor area in the middle of a big city, I\u2019ll definitely be back again!"

That is, if you only have 1-2 days then you can probably skip it, but if you're around for a bit longer then I definitely recommend checking it out.You can take bus #26 from the Pest end of Margaret Bridge (Margit hid) or just walk from either side. Ordinarily, you can also take tram #4/#6 from either side of the bridge, but in 2015 it is under construction for a considerable chunk of the year. Bus #26 runs across the island in case you're too tired to make it all the way and back on foot.Not too far into the island (from the south end, Margit bridge) is a nice fountain that sometimes also plays music. Farther in, on the west (Pest) side, you will find a small zoo with farm animals. Nearby toward the middle of the island is a big garden with lots of roses and other flowers (depending on the season, of course). Continuing on are some historical ruins and then a water tower. Toward the other end of the island (north) is a small construction with a rotunda called the Musical Well (Zenelo kut). This plays music on occasion. Just south of this area, not marked on the map, is a lovely little Japanese garden. It includes a small pond with a statue of a woman that often has live turtles sunbathing on it.The island is popular with runners, there are paths around the island and all over to accommodate that type of activity. It is also possible to rent bikes of all sorts to explore the surroundings in that way."

There are parks, wooded areas and open grassy bits, Japanese garden etc. There are some swimming pools but those are open in the summer only, it was a bit out of season, but still there were some outdoor bars open. We were walking, while others jogged or rode bicycles or quads, golf carts or similar, and some people were training martial arts, must be due to proximity of the Japanese garden... We finished our tour by leaving the island via Margit bridge, which has far less traffic than the other one, and is also closer to the city centre.

Then again, it is very common for locals to make use of the island for training purposes, or to just have a stroll with friends and pets, or you might even see them having a picnic among important figures such as Lizst, B\u00e1rtok and Kod\u00e1ly, whose busts can be found among the beautiful plants and trees of the island. Whatever your reason for visiting the island is, make sure you grab a nice cup of hot apple and cinnamon water if the weather is cold- or a hot ginger water if you like your beverage spicier and do not miss an opportunity to taste a L\u00e1ngos- a local crumpet with cheese, sourcream and some garlicky sauce which will definitely satisfy your taste buds."

It\u2019s a long time since I\u2019ve visited the place in the summer time, but I remember that it used to be a nice pic-nick destination for families. Now when I visited it during the winter time it gave a somewhat shabby and run-down feeling, but even in the wintertime people seem to enjoy the island.

The Island has an fountain with an amazing water display timed to music for 15 minutes each hour during the day, and was very impressive - well worth videoing at least one song."

I couldn't believe how peaceful it was. You can rent pedal cars or electric scooters to look around at very reasonable rates. Some beautiful ruins to see, although the old convent has been ruined with a load of nasty modern steps and bridges. For me though, the park was lacking something. I'd like to say it was because it was November, and I'm sure it's very different in summer (there is a water park on site).Also, there is a mini zoo. For me, the animals didn't have enough room, and the horses had no food or drink which upset me slightly. Worth a visit in summer I am sure, but for me, not my Budapest highlight."

There are gardens, a small zoo, musical fountains,eating places and it is used by joggers as here is a track round the island. It is well maintained and friendly (Keep a few local coins for the toilets!)"

There was a part we walked into where locals gave us very dirty looks but noone offered insight as to why, or if we should be in that part- there were opera singers but we wernt sure if this was an open event. Due to the looks we got we left straight away. To we rented a four person bike which I loved! We had a quick tour around the gardens and a drink before leaving. We were there around 1.5hours. Fun, but wouldn't put it at the top of my list"

Around 5.00 we found ourselves at the water fountains, which then erupted into synchronised dance to three well known songs.

It's a decently far walk from the terminus over the bridge to the park (alternatively, you can take the 4 or 6 tram across the bridge or the 26 bus into the park). We walked and explored the sights inside the park and had lunch at the Water Tower. The climb to the top of the tower wasn't spectacular since much of the island is covered by trees. We walked the length of the island (south to north) and then rented a bringo to do another round trip. 30 minutes in one of those is sufficient; we saw most of the island twice since we had rented it for an hour. The Japanese Garden is under reconstruction (Aug. 2014), but you can still see the ruins of the Dominican Convent and a church. There are also lovely gardens and fields. We had brought a towel and books and stretched out in the grass to enjoy a lovely summer's day. Spend at least a half a day (easily can be a full day if you want to visit the pool) and relax the way the residents do (much better during weekdays)."

There are also some ancient ruins and a lot of eating places for fast food. We walked to the hotel at the far end of the island and had a light lunch at the outdoor patio (the restaurant was closed).

As I grew up in Budapest, actually even close to the Margitsziget, I feel that it's part of my home and l'm always happy to visit again no matter for what occasion or with who. Recently I took a walk there with my 90-year-old grandmother on her birthday, we've seen the renewed fountain that plays music every hour (its music schedule is written next to the fountain), took a walk on the fresh air, met friends, seen many animals, although we didn't even visit the small zoo that is also on the island. It's really close to everything, to the city center, so maybe that's why I like it so much, as it's in the city but it's so different, always quiet, calm and peacful for me.I regret that last time when I was in Hungary but then as tourguide I couldn't go to the Margitsziget because we didn't have enough time, because I think that it worth to visit anytime of the year for any kind of trip: it's romantic for couples, it's fun with children and dogs or with other animals, you can rent there all kinds of vehicles, bike or electric car or you can ride a small train, you can go to the Danube bank and just take sunbath or go to the Palatinus beach or to the open air and closed sport-swimming pool, or take your running shoes and join the locals to a \"szigetk\u00f6r\", to a round on the island (about 5 km) and you can find historical parts as well. You can spend there a whole day no metter on what sort of visit you are (or you can just travel through the island by public bus too), and you can even stay at the island on its hotels.The only problem I had there now was with public toilets that is actually a general problem in Hungary, that there isn't enough toilets and even if there is one, it's expensive. I really hope that this is a temporary problem and will change soon, because this is the only thing that spoiles the perfection of the island for me. But anyway: it's still a must see, I think. :)"

Also if you wan't a nice morning run or to take your loved one to picnic or to take afternoon walk but there's extreme heat - then that's the place. I stayed near by and that island was my first visit - and I loved it. I like nature more than a big city and it was a great walk - specially because the weather was very hot and sun was burning, but thanks to the trees it was cooler to walk there. And it's not just a walk, there's little bit of history (church ruins, memorial), Japanese garden, a tiny zoo, the fountain with light and musich shows (loved that one!), water tower and if you want to visit water park then that's there also. I think I was there about 2 or 3 hours and did not take food with me, but it looked like a great place to take a picnic. I think there was a place to eat also, but I don't know about that more. Oh, and if you don't want to go on foot, you can rent a bike - you can find it after the memorial, just before you go in to the park, I don't remember the prices, though.Overall, I think the island is a great place to just let the time stop for a while : )"

We loved the instant calm and nature! We walked down the running track looking toward Pest. We saw several exercise stations complete with instructions on how to use the equipment. There was a huge hotel/spa which we did not visit. We heard a peacock and thought we had lost our minds. Sure enough, we turned toward the sound and away from the track and found a peacock! There was a little zoo of sorts which is open April to October. We saw storks, little birds, roosters, ducks, ponies, and deer. According to the sign, there are pony rides for 500 HUF. The caretaker told us the three ponies are females and they love the treats one can buy at the concession stand. It was a fun and restful visit. We returned to the running track. We saw runners, walkers, and some people with those golf carts. The next thing we came across was some sort of ruins. I didn't find out until we got home that it was an old abbey which was abandoned and ruined during the Ottoman war. We climbed around there for a bit and then onward to finally an open plaza area with chairs, fountains with dancing waters, concession stands, and different vehicles for hire like a three wheel segway contraption. It was a lovely place. We recrossed the next Margaret bridge and returned to the Pest side. We probably spent 3 hours and enjoyed it all. For anyone visiting Budapest with kids or formore than a day or two, this is a great relaxing place to visit. We did notice that both the buses and the trolley stop in the middle of the Margaret bridge so it would be easy to get there."

So I thought why not. It was a surprise! Yes, I never visited in january or during a rain storm, but I enjoyed the island. Very peacful and tranquil not much going on. That was the charm. A beer and goulash in champs bar! Very nice. If you have the time. Take a stroll and enjoy the little gem in the middle of the city."

We were then amazed to find a beautiful water fountain show. All lit up in red and white lights, we stood and enjoyed some 6 pieces of music with the fountains all choreographed in time to the music. There was a mix of classical and pop classics. The shows run between May and October."

We passed the Parliament and went to the Margaret Island. In my opinion it is not an attraction stricte for tourist, but it's a nice place to walk after a dinner. Many people run and ride bicycles there or simply take a nap in a park, I guess it is a nice place for a family with small children. Allegedly there are some restaurants, although we didn't eat there. The one thing we liked especially was a fountain concert."

With the package you also get an hours free bike hire which we used and it was great. The Island is about 2.5km long and about 500m wide, doesn't sound that big but there is so much stuff on this little Island. There are a few hotels there, sports facilities, running track, old monasteries, a mini zoo and amazing wildlife. The hour on the bike flew by and we covered most of the island stopping of at many of the beauty spots, the best was a pond right in the middle of the island where there were terrapins, fish, frogs and ducks all living together. After the hour bike ride we had a little wonder and stopped off at one of the many food stall selling various things, but we had the Langos with sour cream and it was great. If you have a couple of hours to explore this tiny island then do, it's refreshing tranquil after spending days in the city at the busy tourist attractions. I imagine it is even nicer in the summer, although probably a lot busier."

It is very large, can be beautiful, has a lot of things to do -- if you are with kids. If you are going because your tour book said to do so, think again. Unlike Central Park, or Hyde Park or St. James Park or the grounds of the Villa Borghese, there is no architectural significance to the island,no charm. it is an excellent outdoor recreation and entertainment venue for families. Those facilities look pretty good - and the Transylvanian pastries, sort of a round, cone shaped zeppole you eat i strips - probably made the visit worthwhile. That and finding out my wife had to pay for the toilet, I did not -- and in the style of the city, the toilets were immaculate (they cost around eighty cents) and a kind local told me I did not have to wait on line to pay."

The bridge has not long been refurbished, and leads you down to a huge expanse (and I mean huge), with park, musical water feature, restaurants, takeaway food shops, the road runs both ways on one side, and all around the island there is a running track (an athletics stadium is sited at the entrance to the island) It's popular with cyclists, runners, families (there's a play area not much further past the stadium), and on a warm day, anyone who just wants to sit, relax, read or spend some time with friends.Hugely popular with tourists and locals alike.We loved it, and go every time we visit, always more than onceYou can also grab a hop on hop off water boat here (those tickets are normally free when buying the hop on hop off bus tickets around the city centre. You could spend half a day here, then head off to the numerous other sites along the danube if this was the case."

No ear aches or problems post experience. Later we sat in a 3-4 foot pool with cool water showering down on us. A great way to spend time in miserably hot weather! The changing rooms were busy but clean. There was staff around, and there are private rooms to change in. We didn't bother with a locker, just had my husband watch our stuff while we \"swam\".

The pools, which include a rockin' wave pool and medicinal baths, are priced much more affordably than the private baths in Budapest (like the Gellert) and are just as much fun. It's a very family atmosphere and you can lay out in the grass or have a snack at the cafe. They just added a water slide complex that was a blast. One tip - the lockers are free, use them to store your valuables. While were there a local woman gathered the police to announce her pocketbook, cellphone, etc had been stolen from her blanket while she had been swimming. They were not very sympathetic but seemed to try to do their best to help her, while the other locals on nearby blankets were openly scoffing at her. Entertaining but instructive, this was the only crime we came close to our entire stay in Budapest (which is a very safe city) and did seem self-inflicted.One thing I'm sorry we missed by three days was a water polo match at the pool located a bit further down the island. Hungary was playing Montenegro and we heard it was very exciting - check the schedule before you go to see worldclass water polo."

That is to say one can't completely be satisfied. It is very easily accessible, and is worth walking over the newly restored Margaret Bridge, the view of the city makes for terrific photos. I'm writing this review after last nights visit with family and friends. The freshly restored giant fountain at the southern entrance is amazing, and the water and the lights (best after dark) and the occasional music make is mesmerizing. If you are with kids, as I am most of the time, then you will note that the playgrounds are in various states of repair, from new to broken down. The statues and flower beds likewise. You'll also find a few homeless people here and there sadly. Be careful of the travelling vendors, I would avoid them and even the snack bars (because of the prices). There are three places to swim on the island, the Palatinus (avoid it, big and crowded in the summer), the Hajos Alfred swimming pool (more for serious swimming, but it does have a children's area) and the Spa in the hotel at the north end (hotel spa). I would suggest going to the Hajos A. swimming pool, though it does lack the slides and stuff at the Palatinus. What I haven't done (but should) is join the many fit people jogging around the island on the jogging path... There are various other small attractions, being a history buff I would definitely say visit the ruins of the medieval Dominican nunnery, where Saint Margaret (whom the island and bridge are named after) lived. So go. What continues to bother me is Hungarian inconsistency, the failure to keep everything looking prim and proper and in good working order, we still have this attitude here of it's \"good enough / it'll do\", and I look forward to a time when the emphasis will be on making everything perfect."

There are many varieties of transport to hire, bikes, scooters, bike cars and pedal cars. Flowerbeds dress the park and there is food and toilets available. Toilets cost money which a big minus for Hungary and the rest of Europe. You don't pay to pee in Australia and the US.The park sits on a island in the middle of the Danube and there is a sandy beach where bathers sunbake and dunk in the Danube. A jogging track around the island is in use and a cycle track very popular with riders. A Feature of the park is the marvelous fountain which is programmed for a water symphony. It pleases the kids as well as adults and there are seats to enjoy the performance. Very tranquil and highly recommended."

Margaret Island was on my \"to do\" list so my son (adult) and I decided to rally and continue running our pedometers and hoof it to Margaret Island. What a treasure the island is! As we entered the island the first thing we came upon was the \"dancing\" fountain which was also lit up and the musical number, of all things, was a pretty obscure Rolling Stones tune.....what could be better.....Mick, lights, dancing water! We stayed by the fountain awhile and then continued trekking on the island past several beautiful garden beds and then heard an altogether different genre of music wafting through the gorgeous summer night air of Budapest....it was the symphony. There was an outdoor theater where if you wanted to pay for a ticket you would be seated in the interior. For those not inclined to purchase a ticket the island has plenty of lawn chairs set up outside the arena and a Jumbo-tron so that you can actually watch the symphony on the big screen. I believe there are free shuttles that will ferry you around the island, but I'm not sure. We saw tons of shuttles but preferred to walk. This truly is a DO NOT MISS place to visit when in Budapest! Great people watching venue also!"

We started down one feeling hopeful, but then half an hour later were questioned by park officials as to how we came to be there and were told \" The Borders Are Closed\" rather unsettling, but we figure we were on a closed path, but they had not blocked off the one entrance to that path that we found. There are a lot of abandoned facilities on the island which made it feel that much shadier. The big Fountain at the entrance was turned off and shut as well.

There were some beautiful gardens, great green spaces, and just a lovely place to take a stroll. At the northern tip of the island, there was a small, but exquisite little garden with ponds and lily pads. Coming back along the left side, there is a rubber running path. Since my husband's feel were bothering him, it was an ideal way to walk the last mile! Along that side, there is a swimming complex that can hold 22,000 people.

There are lots to see and do including the outdoor adventure centre and the waterpark. Allot was closed when we visited but we wanted to see Saint Margaret if Hungary' grave, in the old Dominican convent. For us there was only one way to see this island and that on the pedal cars you can rent as you enter the island from the bridge. There are little cars that look like beetles but these are the most expensive. In the same are there are blue peddle cars with red roofs that are easier to cycle and cheaper. For myself and my partner it was less than \u20ac5 , 1300 HUF, For an hour. This was enough time to go around the entire island see everything including some parks ponds and a little outdoor cafe. Cycling is a great way to see the Buda Sid elf the city from the island. The bike also have roofs that keep out the rain. Some even have lights for the evenings. You need to leave identification such as a passport with the company to take the bike. We only had a credit card but the woman was very accommodating and allowed us to take the bikes. We had one of the best hours we had in Budapest, full of laughs. There are some great photographs to take if that's what your into. You can get 2 or 4 sweater bikes and each can take 2 small children on the front. Trust me you won't regret this fun day out. If your planing a day out at the park you have to pay for the public toilets, which are immaculately clean. It's 50 censor less and I think the ticket allows you to use them all day."

BUDAPEST: MARGIT SIGETRIVER ISLAND THAT DANUBE TOUCHINGBy Zoran SlavicIt is an incredible feeling current relaxation when you are in the green Margit Siget. In the middle of the Danube. Transfer from the incredible climax of Budapest, whereas if for a minute do not stop wailing siren ambulance and the police, are embedded in the overall noise of the big city, is fast and elegant. Buses, taxis, bike. Even the walks! Therefore, the shock of pleasure and beauty is so stunning and relaxing. So: Margitsziget (Margaret Island) is a huge island between the two bridges: Margit-h\u00edd and Arpad-hid. Seemingly, it is nailed to the Hungarian capital, a few hundred meters away; this is an island where the city rests his soul. Halfway between Buda and Pest, Hungary largest island in the Danube, originally known as Rabbits Island, now popular as Margaret Siget centuries represented, first, religious rarity, then resort and spa, and today is all that and more tourist attraction, of course. This river island, in the urban environment, an unusual feature of this city. Margit siget has given Budapest, the Hungarian capital, another dimension to the city that has long takes up an important place in a great range of world capitals. Related to Budapest, in recent times, with Margaret and Arpad Hido, this island has been inhabited since Roman times when it was in the Middle Ages monks visited due to its isolation from everyday life, but also kings, due to the hunting. It is called by the name of daughter of Hungarian King Bela (Adalbert) III, Margaret, who is the became a nun in the 13th century. In the 19th century, the island became a place available the ordinary people of this city. Suitable for couples. For Margit Siget I first heard it in the late sixties, the radio transmission water polo match our team against Hungary, taking place in one of his famous pools. Maybe that is the one that bears the name of Alfred Lajos, Olympic winner in the 100 and 120 m from 1896. Year. Having learned about the fact that this place is in the middle of the Danube real small archipelago of island's eighteen, I could not decide what to admire more: the nature that created them, or entrepreneurial, persistent and pedantic Hungarians throughout the centuries and decades of adapting these islands new purpose. The one purpose, which has always been in collusion with what the man from the city, returns themselves, their bodies and their souls. Thermal pools, walking trails, tennis courts, fishing, beaches, open theater, interesting bike trail, two large and representative hotel (old'' Grand Hotel'' Siget Margit, with marble bathrooms and rooms of incredible dimensions, and \"Thermal Hotel\") only part of the content that this Danube island has to offer the residents of Budapest and numerous tourists. Including the inescapable and cute Japanese. The Chinese, however, are not here today, foreign tourists! Many of them live in Budapest. Of the neighboring islands, which are bound in the chain of recreation, entertainment and leisure, first mention Old Budim Island, \u00d3budai Sighet, which is the biggest rival Margit Sighet, mostly because of the fame that has seen in recent years: it has become known as '' Pepsi'' island. The name is derived from a weekly pop-music festival, which brings together the most famous pop groups in the world and over 300,000 visitors. Is not bad and remember the names of some other islands Danube between Pest and Buda, such as Haros, NEP, Molnar, Palotai, Szentendre, and Chapel. If nothing else, at least be surprised how many are refined and regulated by your drawing our previous in this area.

As part of our boat cruise we were able to take the boat there, take around for a few hours and then be guided back along the Danube at dusk. This is mainly a park but there are a couple of hotels with spa treatments if that's what you're looking for. The musical fountain comes alive every hour and there's a lovely garden to explore. Not many places to eat and drink so you may want to bring a small picnic with you. This is an island, mainly for young lovers to escape the city and indulge in romance! - this is also a working park, there are schools and houses but it is not densely populated. if you have spent too much time walking along Budapest's busy streets, then this is a welcome retreat for a few hours."

We changed our mind last minute and as such had a more relaxing day in Budapest, which involved a walk along Margaret Island.First mistake - we decided to catch the Metro to the furthest end of the island away from the centre, and then walk back to the city. Had to get off in not the nicest area and do a long, cold, boring walk over a featureless bridge. Once we got onto the island we could see the running track, which is an excellent facility, and it was well used. We walked the full length of the island and all we really saw were run down buildings and graffiti, it didn't look very well cared for at all.I'm guessing in summer it's much more appealing, and once we got to the city-end it got busier and there were cycles for hire etc which could be fun, but in winter the only redeeming feature was the gentleman selling yummy hot wine from a small stand which was sorely needed! If you're here in winter and you absolutely have to see it, then just make sure you aren't sacrificing any better sights."

Even though it was late September some flowers were still in bloom and the scent of these was a real feast for the nose. It was glorious sunshine too.As we were stopping nearby we decided to come back and try out the car bikes built for two, thinking this would be a quicker way of getting around. Wrong! It was a very good exercise for the legs and we are glad we only had it for half an hour or we might not have been able to walk away from it. Our legs ached!

The queue was not too long after we go off the bus. We entered and went to the little window on the right hand side to get a safety deposit box for our valuables, watches and rings etc. if we had thought further ahead we should have left these in the hotel safe. It was a little odd to be given an old wooden draw to but our belongings in but the system seemed to work and gave us peace of mind. We walked through the complex of pools to try and find a nice spot with a bit of shade, it was 37 degrees so very hot! We found a spot and got some loungers off the piles that were dotted around, some people were just sitting on their towels on the grass etc but the loungers were only about \u00a32 for the day so we thought they were worth it. Staff come round throughout the day and take the money for the loungers and give you a ticket, if you have already paid earlier, you just show your tickets when they come round. We enjoyed the size of the pools and range, this is not a spa but more like hydro pools with jets and water fountains and pools of differing temperatures, our favourite bits were the very small whirpool in the middle of the jacuzzi pool which is activated every half and hour or so, it is very fast and fun. Also the wave pool where the waves come on once an hour for about 15-20 mins. It would be better if the wave pool was more often. People had balls and toys in the pools, there was enough space without upsetting other people.We had cocktails from the bar which were delicious and reasonably priced - would recommend.The actual complex here is quite old, the toilets need a bit of a makeover and the changing rooms are not very well lit etc but we knew this in advance, we were glad of somwhere private to change after a day in the sun and this suited us fine. I would recommend this day out to anyone in Budapest at this time of year it is fun but based on other reviews take your own food in, we had some crisps to keep us going and take some flip flops if you have them."

I lived in Budapest for a year, and Margaret Island was by far my favourite place in the city.It is a giant part on an island, and includes the ruins of two monasteries, a zen garden, a bandstand, a few cafes, ice cream stands, and acres of park land where you can sit an enjoy the sun.My absolute favourite place to sit (and one of my top places in the world for a picnic) was in the ruins of the old monastery. There's a small tree, with a bench beneath it, and you can sit in the shade and watch the world go by. So peaceful.I also like sitting beneath the tree in the zen garden (I think it's a cherry tree, gorgeous blossom anyway), beside the waterfall, watching the terrapins in the water.The musical fountain makes me smile.There are many places to buy langos (a Hungarian snack, deep dried dough covered in sour cream and cheese), frankfurters and potato wedges. You can also rent pedal cars and golf buggy's to drive around the island."

If it hadnt been so hot I would have loved to have tried out the running track around the island it was soft and spongy perfect for my tired legs.The musical fountain was lovely but not well looked after could do with some TLC. There are some animals for the kids to look at, a lovely garden for adults, and a swimming pool to cool down in. Plenty of food and drink available.

There are paddle cars and bikes for rent - I recommend renting them instead of one of the electric carts at the entrance of the park. We rented one electric cart, but it was quite difficult to drive, because the steering wheel was totally unballanced and our cart was moving on zigzag. When I told the guy that the carts need serious repair and maintenace he reacted quite rudely. For one hour you have to pay about 15 EUR, and when the time finish and you are in the middle of the park, have to push the cart back to the same place where rented it. Margaret island and park are must to visit place - just bring some food and drinks with you."

We were met by a guide who gave us a map and advised us to turn left at the top of the stairs from the boat, he also stated that the round trip would be 2.2 kilometres. We were concerned that we would never get to the end of our walk. There were many runners and cyclists coming towards us, also many hire vehicles. After our half way walk we then found limited places of interest, two large sports centres that had been closed some years ago. A Zoo and playground for the children. Derelict tennis courts, Swimming pools which only one appeared to be open to the general public, the other swimming facilities we believe belonged to the Hotels. There were ruins of Dominican Convent and Church and St Michael Chapel. We found a Cafe half way round on our journey and a Restaurant upon our return to the boat jetty. The boat trip was excellent, plenty of English and German tourist information, but if you are not keen on walking, Margaret Island is not for you."

The climb up to the Citadell is full of different paths, with lots of garbage and smells...so, clearly, the next thing to visit was this island. Tram stops at the bridge to the island ( I think the tram number is 6 ), went there around six am and when I got off the tram, I knew I was at the right place for a runner to be in Budapest. Lots of joggers, runners, bikers. The path around the island is exactly 5 km long and paved with runner friendly material, which your legs will love. No smells, some garbage, lots of green trees, lovely views... So, if you are a runner, this is to place to be when one is in Budapest.

A good place for kids, you can rent 'family' bikes (big square things the parents drive and the kids relax). Not a whole lot to see; don't go thinking there are monuments or a bunch of Belle Epoch building behind every hedge.....MI is for relaxing, maybe a bottle of wine and a picnic."

It was full of locals playing rugby and doing yoga. I had read about the Japanese Gardens and musical Bodor Well and was excited to visit these parts of the island. However, the Japanese Garden was very small and unimpressive. The Bodor Well was okay, but it only plays music on the hour apparently. We didn't know this so were not able to enjoy the music. If you're on a short visit to Budapest, you should spend your time elsewhere."

I have to say I like parks, Central Park in New York being my favourite, as an escape from the noise of the city, but whereas Central Park has so much of interest, this seemed to have little.I can understand why it is so popular with the locals with lots of greenery and a running track which appears to go right around the island, but for me there was little else. Having got off the boat, there were no signs but I did eventually find the location of the island's transport being a stop for the road train, cycles, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately I could not make use of the electric car since a car licence was required and I had not brought mine. I thought I would therefore use the road train and when one did arrive I boarded and was told that it would not leave until they had another five passengers travelling. After waiting what seemed like five minutes or so and with no one else showing any sign of interest in boarding, I decided to set off on foot. I walked alongside the road until I saw the water tower. This seemed an interesting climb and once inside, I saw a sign indicating I should pay at the kiosk but with not a soul about I climbed to the top to look at the far from impressive views. On my return to the bottom, two men had by now appeared, but since they showed no interest in me, I walked out. I stopped at a small entertainment arena but with not much to be seen, continued walking until I had then reached the other end of the island. I decided at this point that I really would prefer to make much better use of my time elsewhere and then walked alongside the running track by the river until I reached the boarding point for the boat which was thankfully about to arrive, two hours after I had reached the island.I came here midweek when it was really quiet, perhaps there is a better atmosphere when there are more people around."

Rachel and I decided to stop off at the bar (Who has a bar at a school sports day?) for a few light beers. It took awhile to get served as there was a gang of British lads downing shots and making suggestive comments about the female stewards. Instead Rachel suggested we hire out one of the whimsical cycle-cart type things and we took a lovely trip round the island. On several occasions we nearly had collisions with the youths from the bar who seemed to be having some sort of off-road race in electric buggies. The ice-cream bar was lovely although Rachel dropped her pistachio cornet due to being startled by someone shouting 'toggy'. And I had to jump off the wall of the penguin enclosure to avoid being hit by an out-of-control golf cart. It amused us greatly to see the driver later on explaining the incident to the owner of the carts. We tried again to get a light beer at the bar but still no success (the barkeep seemed a bit worse for wear, and he just kept repeating 'plinky plinky plinky' for some reason). We finally decided to call it a day when someone in the bar threw a whole bucket of water over a poor, understandably distressed transvestite. All in all - it was a hoot!"

We rent a sort kind of skelter because the park is about 2 km long and the walk to the park made us tired, so we didn't want to walk in the park, so the skelter was a good alternative. We found a few nice places in the park like the ruins or the mini zoo (with peacocks...). But too be honest - i was expecting more. Maybe i've been spoiled by visiting the beautiful el retiro park in Madrid (well THAT is a park) - but i think it's a good way to avoid the smell and noise from the city.

It was obviously the \"off season\" because a number of things weren't open. Did walk down the steps to lay in the sun along the river. Took a short but enjoyable nap.

Since time was short, and the island is 2 1/2 km long and 1/2 wide, we had a lot of ground to cover. There's a place to rent bikes right by the Legenda boat dock (close to the Japanese Gardens). I rented a 2 person bike that holds two small kids in the front for something like 2900 HUF for one hour. First stop, the watertower, which is under going renovations (no going to the top, so a bust). Next stop, Dominican church ruins for a quick 5 minute photoshoot. Next stop, a small zoo with some ducks and peacocks on the east side of the island (5 min photos). Next stop, Franciscan church ruins (5 min photos). Now drive north past the waterpark to the Japanese Gardens (a bit sparse in April), a quick stop at the Bodor Well, and then drop off the bike where we got it. Took 45 minutes, got on the next boat to return to the docks. Margaret Island is definitely not a place that a tourist needs to visit, but if you plan it right it's worth the hour, and my quads got a good workout too. If you're a jogger, looks like a great place for a run as they made a track lane with rubber around the island (probably 4 mile run). Clean bathroom by the Japanese Garden, but it costs 150 HUF."

It's marvelous. It's more rustic than other parks, and has a very relaxed feel. Only negative is that there s really no high quality food options on the park, except at the spa hotel at the north end. But burgers, hot dogs and ice cream are perfectly fine for a day at the park."

At the entrance to the park, a man was renting golf carts decorated as little mini Rolls Royces. It was hilarious, fun, silly and quite effective for visiting the sites! There was no way we would have been able to see the whole island without our little rented golf cart. It was HILARIOUS because our first \"cart\" ran out of power and my husband had to push it back to the rental site. It was also hilarious because people in the park were looking at us as though we were crazy in this silly \"car.\" We had so much fun and laughed out loud. It was 2900 forints for 1/2 an hour. We LOVED it!! I highly recommend a visit with a cart!"

It was walking distance from Ramada Plaza. The first thing I saw was the Centenary Monument, created in 1972 to commemorate the 100-year-anniversary of the joining of Buda and Pest. Nearby is a large fountain with background music. Then there are the soccer fields, gardens, pools, petting zoo, lakes, jogging paths. The187ft high octagonal shaped water tower built in 1911 has a gorgeous Art Nouveau tower,and is a UNESCO monument. Travel north and you'll find the ancient ruins of a 13th century convent of Dominican nuns, once home to the daughter of King Bela IV, herself a nun, for whom the island was named. Wander amid the ruins and marvel at the intact foundation areas, tiny rooms and surrounding areas. St. Margaret was buried there in 1271 and flowers are still left on her headstone. The chapel of the medieval monastery has the oldest tower bell in Hungary, cast in the fifteenth century, destroyed in WWII then rebuilt from most of the same bricks. In the Middle Ages, the island was home to a number of religious cloisters, but by the beginning of the 1800s, this 1 mile island was embraced by the royal family, who turned it into an ornate garden. Several food areas or pack your own and relax on the expansive lawns. You could easily spend six hours there if you had the time."

Budapest can be a bit dusty and polluted at street level, so if you're in the city for a few days it is definitely worth paying a visit to Margaret Island, which is like a green oasis in the middle of the Danube. You can hire bikes very cheaply, lie on the grass watching the musical fountain, eat ice cream and generally chill out. There isn't much to see here, but it's a nice change from the bustle of the city."

They play relaxing music, while you breath the dead sea salts. I liked also the lighting red, greem, mellow nice I wished I hade one at home.It is cheaper to use the spa during the week and one gets a discount if booking the salt cave. Also I liked the roof terrace with deck chairs where one has nice views ot the park on Margaret Island.After I went and cycled around the island which was great, beautiful park and fountain nice views of the river relaxing.I got into Margaret Island by taking n bus 133 to Arpaud Hid and then n 26 bus really easy as the other side of the bridge is shut..Budapest over all is very good for cyclist.No fees to the Island but to the spa yes."

You get a nice, unobstructed view of certain attractions that would otherwise be difficult to see. Another positive aspect was that the trip takes you out to the Margaret Island, which is in the middle of the Danube. The boat will take you from the streetside docks, over to the island and drop you off. They then give you a Boarding Pass to pick up another boat heading back to the streetside docks later. The island has various different attraction to see, or you can just enjoy the walking path which takes you around the whole island. For those that are hungry or thirsty, there are multiple establishments blending into the surroundings that offera wide range of confections. A very relaxing and enjoyable respite from the Day-to-Day \"Tourist Traps\""
