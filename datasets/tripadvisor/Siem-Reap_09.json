If possible get a guide who can tell you about these places like our guide Mr. Phally from Indichina Odyssey tours did for us. Bayon Temple is another must see but it is better if you know more about when and why it was built. Enjoy"

We were caught in a rainstorm while visiting in mid-June 2015 and that did not detract one bit from our personal tour. In fact - it perhaps added to the visit, like a scene from an adventure movie of the 1930s - 1950s or Indiana Jones today. I could've stayed at The Bayon for hours longer than I was able to. There's something very calming about it."

Watch out for the monkeys, although they stayed well away from us."

Bayon's was the official state temple of Buddhist King Jayavarman VII and is a stunning example of Khmer engineering and craftsmanship.Bayon's famous for it's columns with carvings of serene faces depicted on each of their 4 sides, but there's a lot more to this temple with hidden shaded alleys, tight staircases and raised ceremonial platforms and courtyards. Possibly the most architecturally unusual temple in the Angkor Wat area and my favourite by a mile.Although smaller than some of the other Wat's with it's intensity of detail it's worthy of further investigation and I'd recommend spending in the region of an hour and a half of your time to fully appreciate it's majesty."

An ideal spot to picture the ancient temple with its reflection on water. 30 metres from the temple entrance will be the day pass checkpoint. Ahead will be many steep steps to conquer to the top where you find many \"Smiling Buddha Faces\" engraved on the stone. It's simply 360 degrees, everywhere. Really unique. One of the few temples that I really marvel the craftsmanship of the ancient times. Walking up there is alike a maze, I walked down the wrong exit ended up in the north gate. Unable to identify fortunately called the driver and asked a local tourist guide to converse with the exact location. He came and picked us shortly. Saw wild monkeys roaming around."

Much like the Great Pyramids of Egypt, the Angkor site (and Bayon Temple) provide a look in to the past - and one cannot help but be amazed by the engineering marvels of the structure - as well as let the imagination run wild with the thoughts of a civilization long-lost living at the site.

The temple looks like it has weathered a storm, the steps are uneven and the wooden stairs installed are narrow. There wasn't so many tourist here, however, due to size, I found I was frequently impeded but slow walkers on the narrow stairs, or people who were slow to take a picture, or need quite a few pictures.

The price goes up starting in January 2017, so if you want to see this incredible site, go sooner than later. The price jumps to $37.00 USD. Get the 3 day pass.

She had no problem walking around it and was amazed at all those big faces, still talks about it. There is at least one set of steep ladders that requires special attention for little ones (& adults to be honest) but if they are steady on their feet it's not a problem with someone behind them.

Bayon is one of the \"satellite\" ruins that you're likely to visit on the same day as the main attraction.You won't want to miss a magical photo op of the Buddha at the center of the entire complex. The candlelit Buddha is nothing short of magical. Be respectful - take off your shoes and be quiet, as it is likely that locals and travelers alike will be praying there.Most likely, you'll be visiting other places in the Angkor complex on the same day. I'd strongly advise visitors to bring at least one spare battery, as there will be almost nowhere you can charge your equipment."

The Buddha head images are incredible and well preserved and restored. You are able to amble around the temples complex and it almost feels like a maze. The front has incredible carvings. Highly recommend this one but it's usually included on most people's visits."

The architecture is probably unique in the world and the dozens of faces built in to the towers are awesome to see. Again like Angkor Wat the trick is to get there as early as possible in the morning, around 08:30 would be ideal, before the crowds arrive at mid-day."

If on a private tour (highly recommended!), try asking your guide when to visit the temple to avoid the most dense crowds.A tip: while not as famous as the Angkor Wat reflections in the moat, Bayon can also be photographed in similar way. While walking or driving around the temple, look for places where it reflects in the shallow moat - you will find a few."

As I love photography, Bayon Temple and all other temples helped create some awesome photographic memories! It has to be seen with your own eyes. The detailing in the stone with nature intertwined, to the architecture of the temple is truly a work of historic art. There are some locals on site that will try to take photographs for you using the exquisite facings of the peaks as a good setting to take portraits (these locals will also ask for money for their help if you accept their assistance)."

It's also from 12th century and is considered as State temple of Jayavarman VII and his successors. As there is no surrounding wall it can be entered from anyside but my guide took me to from the side of long terrace,called E side, with steps and guardian lions and naga balustrades on either side. It's an unique structure with a mass of face-towers to make you feel a stone mountain of ascending peaks. It appears it orginally had 49+ towers but presently only 37 are standing. The initial impact of such towers is overwhelming and quite impressive. The temple undergone many changes from worship of Hindu pantheon of Gods to Buddhism. The temple is composed of two galleried enclosures, almost square, but also on three different levels.Corner pavilions, chapels and gopuras reflect the complex architecture that stood vagaries of history.The towers got four and some three faces with a wonderful view of changing colours with the reflection of Sunlight with the background of trees particularly at upper terrace. The Bas-relief,inner and outer, require at least few hours to relish the intricacies of artistic carvings that deal with historical subjects from battles to daily life.Fine devatas striking adorn the walls of central massif including Siva,Vishnu and also Buddha.Few hours walk with guide explaining the importance of each corner took me to all together different world. Please devote atleast three to four hours, wear a cap and carry a water bottle as heat in the afternoon make you sweat a lot. Not to be missed by any traveller to understand the glory of Khmer art and architecture. Same ticket for Angkor Wat is valid for this temple."

I got there shortly after 0730 opening time and at first believed my cunning plan might just work: from the outside, Bayon looked tranquil but as soon as I got into the heart of the place, the sheer volume of people again took all the pleasure out of it. A shame, as the massive great heads that are its most striking characteristic are wonderful structures snd still faintly evocative even in all the twenty-first century bedlam. But after 10 abortive minutes, I decided to skip them and the bas reliefs and was just glad to be out of there. The nearby Baphuon temple plus the Royal Palace plus the gardens and woods linking them just contained a sane sprinkling of fellow-tourists. It's so worth going to Angkor Thom just for those, and for the wonderful array of sculpted figures on the maze-like inside wall beneath the mound that was once the site of the \"Leper King\".

Of all the temple in the Angkor Complex, this is a must visit temple as it is not only a uniquely designed temple but one that sets the foundation to your understanding of the other temple. The temple was commissioned in late 12th century by Mahayana Buddhist King Jayavarman VII. This man went on to commission a few of the other well known temples including Ta Phrom. Remembering the faces (of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, the deity in Buddhism) would come in handy for your future circuit, as you would see it in the other temples the king commissioned.However, the temple itself is unique with the faces looking at you from all direction.Take a pic with your nose touching one of the noses and take a picture of the temple from across the left lake at the entrance, you get a beautiful reflection of the temple in the water."

There are so many ways to go and a photographic opportunity at every turn. As with all the temples if you can drag yourself out of bed early to be there as it opens then this is the best time to visit, it's quieter, easier to take photos and less hot. Make sure you take plenty of water as climbing the steps and negotiating the flag stones is quite an effort and in the heat quite exhausting. Make sure you have sensible comfortable shoes. Also (and I can't remember if it was here or another temple) make sure you're suitably dressed as they will turn you away if youre not. I wanted to see the lepta to terraces a and the terrace of the Leper King both within walking distance from the main temple. Whereas the temple itself is amazing I am glad the two terraces were within this complex and I didn't go just to see them as I would have been somewhat disappointed on seeing the terraces. Don't get me wrong they are beautifully carved and worth seeing but as part of the complex and not on their own."

Look at that...that's what I said to myself everytime I changed my position to see the unexplainable beauty of this temple... While Angkor main temple makes its position for the greatest engineering, this temple gets 10 out of 10 for the best of its sculptures in the planet...Bayon was the last state temple to be built at\u00a0Angkor, unlike other Angkor temple which were built as Hindu temple and then converted to Buddhism, Bayon is the only Angkorian state temple to be built primarily as a Mahayana Buddhist shrine dedicated to the\u00a0Budda and letter reverted to Hinduism...I would suggest you to click some awesome moments during sunrise and sunset while most tourists are busy in clicking Angkor main temple....Truly, a lifetime experience!"

Unlike many if not most of the other temples in the Angkor Wat complex we visited, this one was so crowded that I was tripping over other tourists the whole time, and had to wait to take pictures at a given spot or of a particular carving. However, part of the reason it's so crowded is that the huge carved heads are just so iconic. They're also beautiful. The shapes of the towers, which are intended to be reminiscent of ancient holy mountains, are covered with carvings. Although the details may be a little fuzzy around some edges, and while the cracks and lichen are apparent even in the best preserved samples, the carvings are just amazing. The overall architecture of the site was interesting- stairs up and down, up and down, around each corner, a few up to go in any door or window opening, then a few down again. It's such an interesting style, although certainly tiring to traverse. I enjoyed my visit immensely."

As with Angkor Wat a must when in Siem Reap. As you will note from other posts we had a private car and guide - it did make life so much easier ($155. Although we paid another $20 each for the day pass). Not a cheap day but it is worth every cent - truly one of the outstanding sights of the world."

Book a tuk tuk driver for a day or half day and have him take you to Bayon and allow you as many stops as you like to see the other smaller temples, and serene but majestic views throughout."

You will lose more money with tourist price. We got a tour for 15 dollars for 1 whole tuk tuk rather than 15 dollars each. This tuk tuk tour started from 5 am to watch the sun rise and he drove us all around showing all temples around Angkor wat.This temple is one place to go to! The only down side is that due to reconstruction you can see the old and new stones. It is very good that this is happening but the difference make it look alittle bit off, taking that old and jungle like feeling.I would highly recommend on getting the early morning tour which starts from 5am- yes this is an early start but as soon as it turn 8 o clock the place is so packed with tourist that it's difficult to take any pictures. Also starting early mean that your less exposed to the hot sun after 12. Be warned there are 2 prices for EVERYTHING. First price is tourist price which is twice or even more than the original such as water costing 1 dollar rather than 50 cent and also the second price, the fair price which you my ask the locals for. Also the cost to enter this temple is 20 dollar which gives you the ability to see all temple."

For all those who want to visit this complex be sure have a good guide book or book yourself a tour guide because if you don't know anything about Bayon Temple then all that you will see there are just pile of stones carved with faces. Do your own research before arriving in Siem Reap so you could appreciate the temples. I will not recommend any guide but all hotels and guest houses in Siem Reap could arrange that for you. This complex is mostly open air so it is best if you wear light clothes and bring an umbrella to protect you from the midday sun and the rain.This is also where you can ride on top of an elephant and have a tour around the surrounds of Bayon."

That was over 20 years ago and I've moved to the quality not quantity school of thought. We were there in May, travelling as a group of 3 adults and a 4 year-old. We rented a car one day which did a tour of 5 temples (I think). My 4 year-old was at the \"not another temple\" stage but the 2nd one, but he still enjoyed this one. I was a bit like him as the heat was relentless and draining. If I had to choose one temple to go to, this would be it. The multidimensional temples, the 360 view, everything about it made this my favourite site of them all."

Even with the place loaded with tourists you can get some great photos and find lesser visited areas.As it turned out I had the opportunity to pass through and explore each and every room and facet of Bayon. Our capable, adventurous ten year old daughter wandered off, quickly becoming disoriented and lost - without water, around noon on a 38 degree day. It took me two hours of searching to find her. Many important lessons learned there and some dark thoughts thankfully dispelled. The limited staff on-site were very helpful and patient.This is another temple I'd suggest visiting with a guide as it is one thing to take it on face value but would be far more rewarding with the accompanying stories and histories."

I must have arrived at the same time as Chinese tour groups and it became difficult to navigate the narrow corridors and get around the ruins, not to mention it was impossible to take a photo without one of these tourists in it :)"

Angkor Wat is beautiful for pictures, especially at sunset, but overall loud, crowded, and less intricate once inside. THe Bayon Temple is entered through a beautiful archway/bridge on the roadway. The Bayon Temple itself has myriad (48) faces on the pagodas. There were originally around 52 or 54 and is therefore amazingly intact. This area was less popular than Siem Riep and it was easy to feel at peace and take a leisurely stroll around the area. At the top, you can take a photo with your nose seemingly touching the nose of the smiling faces or you can just appreciate the many carvings. You will see people dancing, which if you take enough pictures and combine them in a video will seem to actually dance before your eyes. You can also clearly see the depiction of the Khmer (cambodians) defeating their enemies, the Char (probably not spelling that correctly) and celebrating their victory."

This was perhaps the most fascinating temple of them all - countless serene stone faces looking to the distance is something you really have to see for yourself. It was like stepping into a movie or a game. Only thing making the experience not-so-magical was the enormous hordes of tourists that clearly all wanted to take a picture with a selfie-stick in front of the giant smiling face. In the upper terrace, you could not properly move or even see the carvings if you wouldn't line up to take a picture with someone in front of them. We visited around noon hoping that the heat would bring a little space to see the temple, but no. The temple is super-popular photo-op so I think it's crowded all the time.On the positive side, the perfect-selfie-hunting crowd usually goes along the path that goes straight through the temple and up to the upper terrace. If you take a side-road, you can have a little adventure inside the temple's inner and outer gallery. It's amazing, there's no-one on sight, you can hear the jungle, have a little Indiana Jones- moment - and still see the many faces of Lokeshvara from down below."

It is much smaller than Angkor Wat, and by comparison is much quicker to visit. Look out for the many carved smiling faces on the remains of the towers. There was restoration work going on when we were there, with several areas fenced off. It seemed somehow odd seeing a large modern mobile crane standing next to the temple. We went there in the afternoon, having visited Angkor Wat in the morning, however, it does get very hot in the afternoon, so make sure you take a bottle of water with you."

Used a tuk-tuk to get a more \"authentic\" local feel but I'm sure going around via an air conditioned van would be a lot more comfortable.

The second time we checked out the sculptures around the temple which are very interesting. This is a must visit.

I even believed in aliens just because of this temples wondering how they made such incredible structure in limited technology.A must visit and its actualy very near to the temples; here are some tips for your visit!1.First what we did was buy ticket in a goverment controlled establishment (you a have a choice of a 1day 2day or 3day pass for all the temples included) we got the 1day pass for $20 and visited 6 temples.If you are not that into walking i would suggest to just visit bayon and angkor or just split the temples in different days for there will be alot of walking! 2.SLEEVLESS,SHORTS,SLIPPERS,SHADES AND SCARFS ARE NOT ALLOWED although sandals may be considered.but most importantly make sure to be comfortable to enjoy ur visit. 3.Just to be sure dont forget to check the weather,temples dont have roofs and there are only few convered area so if it is gonna rain i suggest you bring you rain coats or umbrella."

There are some fantastic carvings on the outer walls, and of course, the views from the top of the temple are extraordinary.Bayon, however, is another temple that can get overrun with tourists, so the trick is to arrive there either before or after most tour buses are there. Ask your local guide about these times, but it seems to me that most tour buses arrive at the temple between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. If you explore Bayon over the lunch hour, you'll see fewer tourists. If you can endure the heat of the day (and Bayon does get very hot), arriving at 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. will greatly improve your chances of avoiding large groups. A late afternoon visit would also be good.My best advise is to talk extensively with your local guide about the timing of your visits to Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Prohm, etc. If you can create a schedule that allows you to arrive at these temples before or after the big groups do, you'll have a better experience.On a general note, Bayon is a can't miss temple. It's amazing. -- John Shors, bestselling author of Temple of a Thousand Faces: A Novel of Angkor Wat"

So we explored the different places and tried to see what others saw hundreds of years ago and what stories they had from being their. Trying to find special writing or symbols in the walls that were unique and not just the same pictures everyone has of the faces. The faces are beautiful and original, but their is a story behind it and I hope everyone experiences that one day from there."

It's not as large as Wat and the floor is quite uneven in places. The stone faces of Buddha are simply amazing and instantly recognisable as a back drop to many films and photo shoots. It was crowded and was somewhat spoilt by a large crowd of whooping, poorly-behaved and rude tourist group from mainland China (my partner is Hong Kong Chinese before you think I'm a rac***)Make sure you have space on your memory card for the many photos you'll take. I've heard afternoon, when the sun is high and the hordes retreat to the pool, is a less crowded time to visit....Awesome place. Recommend highly!!"

As we approached the entrance we hopped off the tuk tuk and walked along the bridge lined with 54 stone figures of gods (left hand side) and 54 figures of demons (right hand side). We then passed under the impressive stone entrance tower topped by four heads of Buddha.This was one of our favourite temples. It\u2019s impossible not to enjoy all of the smiling faces carved into stone looking at you as you make your way around this Buddhist temple. The temple is surrounded by trees and earlier in the morning there were not as many people which added to the serene feeling of the site. There were also lots of corridors to explore with intricate carvings depicting warfare, everyday life and mythological scenes. We spent about an hour wandering around this wonderful site.We went through with a guide, driven by a tuk tuk driver, as this was included in our accommodation package and organised by our hotel. We found having a guide was invaluable as it not only helped us navigate the large site, but also put things into relevant historical and religious perspectives for us. To visit any of the Angkor Wat temples you need to have an Angkor Pass, available in 1, 3 or 7 day passes. This gives you access to the temples for any of those number of days in a given week, or month if you have a 7 day pass, they don\u2019t have to be used on consecutive days. We went with a 3 day pass for $40. When you go to the main entrance to get your pass your photo is taken and printed on the pass, which you must present on each visit to a temple.We had visited Angkor Wat beforehand and exited Angkor Thom through the East Gate to go to Ta Prohm Temple afterwards on the same day as they were included in our full day tour, however although it was beneficial going through these sites with the knowledge of a guide, due to the heat and the magnitude of what we were viewing if we could do it again we would leave these sites for a separate visit and take more time with each.We enjoyed travelling between the temples by tuk tuk, it was a unique way of travel for us and we also appreciated the cool breezes as we travelled.It gets hot visiting the temples, especially in May, so taking lots of water and wearing a hat and sunscreen are a must. Also a good insect repellent to avoid mosquito bites is advisable. Fair bit of walking over uneven ground so recommend comfy shoes."

You will take some of the most professional looking pictures EVER! Bayon Temple doesn't have bad angles. Trust me, you'll have more than enough to fill up your office walls, and frame some for Christmas gifts! It's amazing how time has done little to whittle the faces away. The parts that HAVE crumbled, crumbled in just the right way. However, I suggest the same thing for all Cambodian temples: eucalyptus oil mixed with lotion to ward off mosquitoes, comfy shoes, a good camera, a bottle of water, a hand towel for wiping away sweat, time, a smile and a curious nature to wonder the stone hallways of the ancients."

The climb is punishing but well worth it!Bring a lot of water, wipes etc as Bayon Temple can be brutally hot and involves a lot of climbing (the stairs are incredibly steep in places).

I didn't get around to nor did i have time to count the 54 towers and we know the smiling buddha faces on each of the four sides of each tower are no longer all there. Never did find out how many of the original 216 are still present but Bayon Temple is still a sight to behold. There does appear to be one particular buddha face that everyone likes to or will have their photo taken next to because it is at the right level and is the right size. It is fun to check out as many areas of the temple as time allows. There are areas to sit and get some shade and there are some regions with steep steps to climb. It is also easy to get separated from your party if you or they venture off. Another must-see in Angkor Thom."

I went to Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Phnom Bakheng, and to the Bayon complex (which includes the Bayon temple, along with a number of other structures like the Elephant Terrace!!!!). Bayon Temple was HANDS DOWN my favorite of all of them. My friend and I went at 6 in the morning. The thing is, it doesn't open until 7:30. So we were just walking around the perimeter when someone--a student--invited us into the temple and offered to show us around. So, yes, we basically got a private tour, which made it very magical. We could really experience the space, absorb the energy, take in the angles, and feel the Buddha all around us. It was quite moving and even emotional at moments. If you go, try to go early to take in the majesty of the structure, and also leave enough time to visit some of the other sites in the complex!"

It is one of it's kind. don't forget to take your picture with the carved Buddha the epic 'nose to nose' on top of the temple. The stairs are very steep so you must hold on the the hand rail. If it rains it may get slippery. Wear comfortable shoes because the floor is uneven. The corridors can be a little bit dark and also tight to walk especially with tourists flocking into this temple."

The difference is that this temple is purely Buddhist and that many of the statues and carvings are in much better condition. It is a perfect site for visitors with small children as it is small enough for them to explore without losing concentration. It is a real gem of a site and well worth the visit. we did it after Angkor Wat and wasn't too demanding as there is a little more shade around to take respite"

They certainly know their way around but, if you choose to follow, be prepared to have to pay in the knowledge that his back story may not be entirely true!

We got lucky and there was one elephant left and we were able to ride an elephant into the temple site. Felt like Indiana Jones! The faces in this temple are incredible. Our guide taught us so much and pointed out so many neat features. We spent half the day there and it was worth it! Of course I think our guide was a big reason why."

Bayon Temple in the Angkor Archaeological Park is wondrous!There are LOADS of steps so it's not suitable for anyone who isn't sure-footed, possibly including very young children. There are various places where you can stand to see many different profiles of the massive stone-carved faces at the same time, and a couple of places where you can stand to pose and appear \"nose to nose\" with one of the faces. Elephant rides are available outside the temple, but the elephants look to be in poor condition with obvious elephant hook sores on them. Various locals I spoke to said they didn't endorse tourists riding the elephants because of the cruel methods used to \"train\" the animals. Take water - all those steps in the sun makes for a VERY hot day, but well worth it!"

Would definitely recommend to go and walk around, but if possible, do a early or late trip there, so that you can avoid the crowd. I walked around for about half an hour, but once you get up there where all the \"Heads\" are, there were SO many people there, making it hard to move around with the limited space, and not to mention viewing it in more detail or taking a decent pictures. But overall, a very interesting place with great history, but pick your time to visit carefully."

Bayon is on what the locals call the \"short route\". You should be able to hire a TukTuk for 1/2 day for about $12USD. We were able to see Bayon and surrounding temples, as well as Ta Prohm before 12 noon, when the temp becomes unbearable."

There are incredible carvings of faces throughout the temple; it's a bit maze-like, stay with your group! We had a small mishap where we split up, and it was a bit difficult to find each other (even though it's not terribly large).Do not skip this temple! You will regret it. As with all of the temples, if you visit when it is hot, do not forget water, sunscreen, etc. The heat is powerful, especially if you're not used to it."

Being late March and very hot humid and a little dusty didn't dampen our enthusiasm, if you can handle the heat the advantage is there are many less tourist so easier to get around, see everything and get photo's without a million random sin them. We arranged our tours through Exo Travel and while this may have cost a bit more than getting a Tuk Tuk and a local guide, we would highly recommend their services, the information provided by our guide Mr Som was informative and entertaining, not only about the structures but also about Cambodian history within this part of Asia and where and how all of these Temples were placed within this history. One of the best things was having a driver that met you at the end of each tour with a cold towel and an ice cold bottle of water. Another bonus with local knowledge was the guidance about how to avoid getting harassed by some of the locals. Do your self a favour and pay a bit extra you'll be glad you did.."

When I arrived on mid-March 2016 morning, there was a traffic jam to get through the main entrance gate. Cars and tuk-tuks and motorcycles were trying to get in. In addition there were many people on foot taking pictures of the same iconic images on the entrance gate.So, in order to comply with tripadvisor.com guidelines, I will temper my opinions reluctantly: The \"selfie\" culture, along with the annoying \"YOLO\" ethic has interfered with the quiet, authentic experience of travel to Angkor---as well as many other places on this earth!Bayon is beautiful! I had to wait in line to walk through the interior passages because people were taking photos of every angle and edifice of the site. Not happy!Bayon is great! \"The Bucket list\" is tiresome. This ethic, promoting the idea that travel is something you do to brag about and check of places is quite tiresome.The faces of Bayon are the primary attraction and I think are now becoming the face of the Angkor experience, rather than the main Angkor site and the sunrise over the towers. (BTW, the sunrise over Angkor is underwhelming and not \"the most amazing thing ever\", or even a \"must do\" as many reviewers note. If you don't feel like getting up early on your vacation, don't do it.)"

I found the carvings on the wall more interesting and clearer to make out especially those depicting everyday life of the time. Chinese gamblers, women giving birth, a turtle biting someone. It seemed the carvers had a sense of playfulness about them. The huge faces were also inspiring and the view early on of the the layers of the temple rising to the tower was breathtaking. It is also less strenuous then Angkor Wat, for those who have some mobility issues or who suffer unbearably in 40 Celsius heat that is fairly typical for this time of the year. My recommendation is that if you have a choice, December is a better time to visit with the rainy season closing and the temperatures much better. In late March the whole place is brown, dusty and very hot, typical weather according to our guide."

Bayon Temple is not as big as Angkor Wat but it has many more smiling buddha faces throughout the temple, and not little ones either, but great big ones.This temple was part of my day tour with a guide. I was very happy to have him showing us around this temple because, like many of the temples in Cambodia, there are elements from both Hindu and Buddhist eras. For example, there was a whole wall that once had held a row of bas-relief buddhas that had been hacked off some time in the past leaving only the flowery outline that surrounds most buddha carvings. But the best part to me was visiting the top level which has buddha faces carved into each tower, 200+ I was told, many of them several meters high. The other good thing about this temple is that none of it was under renovation so were were able to explore everywhere. This is a great place if you want some really great pictures of giant Buddha faces to take home and remind you of your adventures in Siem Reap"

I had seen photos of sculpted heads, but nothing prepared me for the size of these heads - the 4 stones used to make up the face alone are massive. Angkor Thom stayed in my mind as I renamed it Ankle Thom when I slipped and twisted my ankle between the ancient stones What amazed me was when a group of people came to help, They brought me water, and a girl massaged tiger balm into my ankle which made it feel better almost immediately - fantastic people.

If you have a travel guide, listen to him/her (which I didn't do because I was already in awe of the place), if not, have some research before going. This is actually a must visit place in Siem Reap. One thing tho, it was very very very very hot when we came so make sure to bring water while you go around the area."

The 58 spires of the Temple represented the various regions at that time. The walls are carved and etched telling stories of life from that era. This would be difficult to tour if you have mobility issues. You also have to keep an eye on smaller children as there are no safety rails.

Once you have paid for the driver, guide and entry ticket for the Temples complex, it is definitely worth going to more temples than just the famous Angkor Wat. If you nevertheless don't want to spend the whole day at the temples and would like to see only 1 or 2 more, I would highly recommend this one. It seems to be the best preserved one. Besides you could easily find a spot to take a picture with several Buddha faces - our best was 5 faces at a time :)Approaching the tempel you could also see an exhibition on how tempels are being restored and how they were built back then. For the ones without a guide this is also the right place to get more background information about gods and religious fights."

Spending hours a day at various ancient sites can get tiring. You may be sick of walking through old stone buildings regardless of how fascinating they are, but do not miss Bayon. It's part of the huge (larger than Angkor Wat) Angkor Thom temple complex, and it's a beautiful walk/drive in. Once you get there, you can see giant heads made of stone blocks - very eerie. As with Angkor Wat, it's a popular place, so it might be good to visit Bayon on a weekday and in the heat of the day (if you can tolerate it) so as to avoid so many tourists. You won't regret it!"

Once we got inside, the layout revolved around several towers, which housed Buddhist shrines within them. Unfortunately due to the sheer amount of tourists there we didn't want to spend so long inside and left within the hour. If I were to do this attraction again, I would come during the low rainy season - as my guide pointed out there would be less tourists and a layer of moss amongst the ruins, adding to the wow factor."

Usually there is more space to get pictures without other people being within the pictures. - Less kids and people trying to sell you stuff as you walk in.Cons - Can be a problem with people that have difficulties climbing places as this one (in my view) more labour intensive.- (Not really a con - but just be aware) temple has a lot more residence bats, birds and giant moths.

Our tuk tuk driver explained that each tower represented a province of the old Khmer Empire. The walkways are narrow and with lots to see, but can get annoying if you are caught amidst the noisy tourist groups. Try to pick a less busy time to go."

It was completly off our radar but the tour company had it as our first stop (via tuktuk) on the was to Angkor Wat. We were all blown away... someone could have told me it was the only site in Siem Reap and I would have been happy. The moat, entrance and long path to the temple was gorgeous... the shopkeepers were friendly and didn't harass too much. The monkeys bothered no one and folks took rides on elephants (I understand some people disagree with this sort of tourism so wanted to mention it does occur here). Bayon itself is massive and there's currentlysome construction work occurring but nothing major. There were lots of tourists but the flow moved and there were tons of amazing photo opopportunities. We highly suggest Bayon if you have time... it's absolutely incredible, until you compare it to Angkor Wat itself."

I found the wall decorations even more amazing than the 4 heads on most towers the complex is typically more known for.Make sure you start the visit early in the morning. That way you not only are able to avoid the hot sun during the late morning until mid afternoon, but you will also avoid the masses of people ( they are usually all at Angkor Wat for the sunrise and the climbing of the third level). If possible, hire an experienced guide to tell you about the decorations and everything else you see."

It's hard to believe how they could build foundations to support the weight of these temples that could last centuries and transport the rock required to build these structure's. Get a Tuk Tuk (shop around for price), and a ticket for 3 days because there's so many temple ruins to see and have a hat and sunscreen. Angkor Wat is amazing but I felt the Bayon Temple was far more spectacular. The touts are relentless at all the temples so get used to saying no. Remember they have to make a living too. If you want to buy souvenir's remember if you show interest then walk away the price will drop, e.g. A painting I liked at $250 dropped in price the further I got away down to $90. A must see"

I was excited to see the reliefs and sculptures but the hoards of noisy tourists really ruined it for me. As you make your way up the temple, it gets squashy with the amount of people and being hot as it is just made me irritated and annoyed. For this reason I would recommend seeing this earlier in the morning of late in the afternoon as unlike other temples, there are no trees for shade. But commenting on the architecture and structure, Bayon is a curious maze, a lot of fun to wander through and make your own discoveries. I even went back for a second visit on our last day, because there's always sometime else to see.The reliefs are awesome, the detail that has gone into them are amazing. And the fact that it is telling a story just makes it more astounding. I would recommend buying a book and reading up on the scenes depicted so that it can be better appreciated. Chams verus Khmer, scenes of everyday life. There's so much to take in. The smiling faces are eerie yet evoke a sense of peace. There are many opportunities for the typical corny tourist photos here! Bayon is not as grand nor as simple as other temples, it sort of in between, on its own, unique, eclectic, full of quirky details. But it's definitely just as memorable as the Angkor Wat."

My advice is to space your temple visits out over two days, especially during the wet season (hot, humid) as it is easy to become worn out after seeing two, and you want to be fresh to experience each one to to the maximum. Hire a guide for the best experience, the Khmer guides are highly informative and exceptionally friendly, and will show you small interesting intricate elements of the temples you might otherwise miss."

The temple sat at the center of Angkor Thom, a walled city that served as the capital of the Khmer Empire. Four of the city's five gates sat on axis with the temple, and the walls of the city substituted for the enclosure walls normally found at Khmer temples. The walls sit at such a distance from the temple that the temple seems to rise abruptly from the ground like an artificial mountain. In fact, the temple was intended to evoke the form of Mt. Meru\u2014the cosmic mountain at the center of the world in Buddhist cosmology. In keeping with this cosmic symbolism, the plan of the temple is based on a 'yantra', a symbol used by Tantric Buddhists as the basis of mandala diagrams that represent the layout of the universe. The temple honored not just one deity, but a host of gods found throughout the Khmer empire. Its central shrine held an image of Jayavarman VII, who perhaps imagined himself as a god-King ruling in the name of the Buddha.The temple is best known today for the gigantic face sculptures that adorn its thirty-seven surviving towers. Facing in four directions on each tower, the faces are thought to represent Lokeshvara, a Buddhist deity that projected benevolence outward to the four directions."

There are lots of shades, so you can enjoy the breeze from time to time.The elephant terrace, lepper king terrace are only 5-10 minutes walk to the north of Bayon temple.There are plenty of restaurants around elephant terrace ( 5 minutes from bayon)But be careful as you might get sick.The weird thing about these restaurants is that they all have different number above them, but their menu is exactly the same, make sure you bargain for the food when they approach you to get you on their restaurant. You can get a food around 2-3$ nstead of the written price (6-8$)! I've never bargained for food, so it sounded odd to me.

Visiting the temples at the park can be a long exhausting day, but it's why you came to Siem Reap so take the time and hire a tuk-tuk to take you around for all day!

Like most other temples try and visit very early before the Chinese and Japanese mass tourist trips arrive. They tend to arrive at midday so its worth getting up early, also the heat of the day really builds by 12.30pm so another good reason to arrive early. By the way be aware of photo scammers at this temple. We experienced it twice one was a chap casually dressed who said he would take a photograph of my wife and I, he then lead us to another \"perfect spot\" to take another photograph etc. aftering taking a few snaps he then requested that we pay him 10$ for his services! If this wasn't bad enough we had a policeman...yes a policeman try and pull the same stunt when we visited a second time!"

You really feel like an explorer as you walk through the dark tumbled down chambers of Bayon or up the steps to the peak of Baphuon.We also got a tuk tuk driver to take us on a tour of some of the smaller temples from here for $18. We were offered 2 tours, the big and the small, we took in the big tour which takes in a lot of very cool temples, but we wished we had taken the small tour which included the most overgrown temple.Beware: there are muggers operating in the more secluded jungle temples."

There are over 50 large beautiful Buddha carvings on steeples and around the temple. Only downside is that there is quite a bit of climbing involved though and steep steps, so it maybe difficult for elderly or those traveling with children. But if you are in Cambodia, I would say the Bayon (inside Angkor Thom) is a must see for temples. Especially if you are short on time like us, this temple would be in the top 3. Fortunately, we had a great Tuk Tuk driver who spoke fluent English and gave us good background and history about the temples as well including the Bayon Temple.

Arriving by tuk-tuk from Siem Reap, the first glimpse is of the South Gate of Angkor Thom, which appears on the road as if stepping out of the surrounding jungle, with a tower adorned by 4 faces of Jayavarman VII. The Bayon temple itself has the most surviving faces on towers of any of the temples, and a special resultant feeling of being watched by the ancients during a visit. Indeed, this feeling is so pervasive here, that a special connection seems to exude from the surviving stones if you can spend some time in relative quiet contemplation. Contemporary with the Magna Carta in England, the Bayon (and the entire Angkor complex) instantiates the existence of great civilizations and accomplishments outside that of western-centric familiarity.Tour groups abound here, since the Bayon is one of the temples on the \"short tour\" as well as the \"grand tour\", but if you time your visit right (early morning or around noon) and avoid the tour group \"rush hours\", a special experience can still be had even in high tourist season."

However, I went there one evening and thought that the trees bathed in the brief golden glow of the evening sun were lovely and provided a great background for photos of the face-towers. It was near closing time too and much easier for photography as I found that some shots I took that evening were very difficult to capture again with the crowds of visitors the next day in the late morning."

Hence, the style of carvings changes as you move around the ruins. Another uniqueness of this temple is at the top level where large carvings of the Buddha faces remained intact, which makes this place an amazing location for photography. This temple is among those at the Angkor region, so plan your time in order not to clash with the tour buses. Tour buses usually pour in from 9am till about just before lunch time.

There's something magical about it. Being within the temple among the 200 smiling faces, one has to wonder about how great the ancient Khmer Kingdom must have been and how the place was built, at the same time feel a chill running through their body with the mystical atmosphere. There's also something serene about the place that makes you reflect on life - how small you are compared to the universe. All of these just in one place. My favourite interpretation of the temple given by our guide was that the the faces represent the King Jayavarman VII looking after all of his people in the Khmer Kingdom."

Either would justify world heritage status. What i really liked was you could get right up to them both. Wandering around the face towers in a really magical kind of ancient 'big brother' is watching experience. Apparently there are 37 face towers each with 4 sides, but not all towers have 4 faces. Incredibly in this day and age it is still disputed how many faces there actually are!. Buy the book from the guys in the car park and it details the dispute (the book is just one dollar - but actually costs seven dollars when you agree to buy one!). As well as book sellers there are also water and soft drink vendors (50c for a small bottle of water, 1 dollar for a coke) and numerous monkey troupes around the entrances. Best visited as a walk through from one side over the top to the other side, and then a trip around the bas reliefs. We spent about 90 minutes and didn't see it all."

He even helped me to take another few pictures when we bumped into him again and he did it out of his own goodwill. This is contrary to my experience at another temple (Preah Khan) when the tourist guards help to take pictures and later blatantly ask for tips which I was shocked at their straightforward attitude towards all the tourists. If you do bump into a male tourist guard at Bayon, do approach him to ask him for help in taking pictures and if you do not have a spare change for tips, just thank him for his help and his smile is very genuine and untainted, just like the smiling buddha."

I've heard so many great feedback from the travellers and couchsurfers we've hosted who visited the temples. Most of them, if not all, have said that Bayon was their favorite. When we visited ourselves, my friends were never wrong about the temple. It was a really sweet treat for me and my son with how different the temple looked from all other temples. The different levels between the rocks and interior itself were really beautiful. My son enjoyed going in and around the temple pretending that it was his room. He and I played comparing of our rooms from each other. It was indeed the most fun time we had during that visit in the different temples. I could spend the whole day reading a book to myself while being in a relaxing place like Bayon."

We started out early this morning, with two tuktuks, and the plan was to make the trip around the 'big' loop, with short stops at each temple. Follow up visits are permissible under the ticketing arrangements, so this plan worked out nicely and avoids 'ruin fatigue'. The temples are visually arresting, and if you can slip through the band of vendors unharassed- definitely the better. The roadside eateries along the way offer welcome iced tea and very good coffee. Tip - make sure you establish an RV point with your tuktuk driver for each temple spot, as some exit points are on the other side. Drivers have also been known to abandon passengers who bargain too heavily.Camera wise: would recommend something wide (eg. 14-24) and stopping down to F4, WB on shady to get the warmth of the blocks inside the ruins and under the trees."

Once again we noticed that by adding 5+4 we got the magical number 9 and also by adding 2 +1+ 6 we got 9. This number seems to feature a lot in the temples. Apparently the best time to visit this places is early in the morning or late in the afternoon but we were there mid morning and it was still fantastic. The carvings on the outer wall are really interesting because they show 11000 figures going about their everyday life in 12th century Cambodia. There are pictures of a naval battle, people checking heads for something, possibly lice, hunters and people cooking a pig while others appear to be carrying water. These are very clear to see.Well worth a visit even if it is raining but I would recommend that you wear good walking shoes because it can be a bit slippery when wet. Jenine"

It can be difficult to get photos here without other tourists but the beauty of this temple is second to none! In my opinion the best pictures here can be taken near mid-day. You will want to take photos from almost every angle and if the sun is low it will ruin your shots one way or the other. I highly recommend taking the photos with the temple's reflection in the pond from the back side."

The famous stone faces are truly a sight to behold and when you personally go face to face with them you will marvel how much effort the stone masons took to crave out a face using multiple blocks of sandstone. As mentioned in my previous post, there is an entrance fee payable before entering the temple compound and I will recommend not to go do the temple tour too late. Chartering a tuktuk will be highly recommended and will save you a lot of money compared to those pricey deals offered by the hotel concierge. 5/5. "

Bring some good climbing shoes, because the steps can be a bit tricky, particularly if it is wet out.

We visited twice as we were too exhausted the first day to see it all but enjoyed walking around the passageways underneath the temple in the shade. Sadly the second day it was jam packed with tours, tons of them all looking at the same things and getting in the way of anybody without a guide. It ruined the ambience and feeling. At the top of the temple you can see lots of stone heads but try to come at a quiet time if you can. We wish we didn't come back the second day.Be prepared for fake guides that charge you, sellers calling you to buy things and book sellers. But that's at every popular attraction. Please don't give money to the children they are working for someone the money won't go to them and they will go out and do the same thing the next day. Remember to promote good tourism in the country. Also you can get elephant rides here we weren't too sure on the welfare of these elephants you may want to enquire or research before getting a ride."

            "review": "Fascinating for Tibetan Buddhists. There is a new theory that The Bayon and the temples of that period were as a result of mass initiations and state Tantric Buddhism. If you are a Tibetan Buddhist, you don't need to read that: you can see it as soon as you look at the Bayon, just as you can with the Shwe Dagon pagoda or the stupa of Mihintale in Sri Lanka - even if the figures of Tara in The Bayon are too different from the versions that we know to recognise without a guidebook. With a doorstep and a new shrine every few feet, it's tiring to walk around some parts, but even if there are many tourists crowding the top, the lower levels and galleries are very quiet. I'm not going to buy into any theory of who the smiling faces represent, as I have my own ideas, but to understand this temple would take a deep background in both Khmer archaeology and Tantric Buddhism, and I'm not sure if anybody in the world has this. Architecturally, The Bayon is crowded and seems rather chaotic. It's hard to take in although it's not especially large. If you look carefully, you can see the remains of post holes and holes that supported tiles: then you realise that the bare stone is only the skeleton of walls that once supported richly decorated tiles of wood, ceramic, bronze, gold, and silver, and you can imagine its glory. This was a mandala in stone, not a place for people to visit to do practice but a magical centre and geomantic blessing for the civilisation, still as living as are the equivalents that are being built today. Whereas the Hindu temples of Angkor have, like Hindi temples everywhere, murals of gods, this, as a Buddhist temple, has images of daily life, from the lowest to highest. The caretakers there are also fascinating to talk to and very helpful. When I offered my pass, which was so drenched in sweat that it was falling apart, they exclaimed in concern and asked to hang onto it and dry it out. By the time I came out they had done this, very carefully, and put the pass in plastic for me. One guide could tell what country visitors were from with only a brief glance, which I tested by asking them - that included people like Argentinians and Mexicans. The caretakers get a very low wage and are there from their commitment and feeling for the past. A lot of them are meditators and very spiritual. I fell in love with the gentle Cambodian people.Temples that are less visited have a stronger feeling of spirituality. But The Bayon is still one of the greatest architectural marvels of the world, and I feel enriched just for having visited it."

In fact, it is easy to get lost as the four sides of this temple look pretty much alike. So better get your bearings before you head inside, otherwise, just head out and go around the temple from the outside.There is also a wall of drawings just before you head indoors and there's a long long story to tell. If you're interested, make sure you get a guide. In fact, when I first visited this place, the guide told us that their version is already a very short summary. In reality, It takes 10 days to tell the whole story! ;-)"

There are many many columns and each face has a different expression which makes this temple very interesting. Sim explained that the higher the column and the faces, the more likely they would be to have been defaced in previous wars because the higher you are, the more important you are.

We did a Grasshopper pushbike tour and thoroughly enjoyed it as it covered a few different temples and riding the wall of one temple. If you get a good guide they'll explain the history of the temples which is amazing to hear - especially for an Aussie when we come from such a comparatively young country."

Massive stone structures, just beaming with ancient history and wonder! Monkeys are all over the place too... as long as you don't feed them, you're fine. What was not 'fine' about our first experience with our first temple at Angkor was walking right into one of the first scams we learned first hand. ***Beware of good english speaking 'locals' that approach you and ask \"Hello, where are you from?\" This is the opening line to a blind sided scam. They tell you they are volunteering for their school, walk you around, tell you about the place, maybe take a pic for you (like this guy did for us) and then about 15 min later, they ask you for a 'donation' to their school. They even show you a piece of paper, with people's name on it and the dollar amount they donate - all in the same handwriting, all the same amount. This was when we just looked at each other in disbelief that this guy had been dragging us along, thinking that he was really doing good, being generous and kind hearted...nope. Just trying to scam you out of $5, 10 or 20 dollars. You think it goes to a school? Nope! When we told him we didn't have any money to donate, he started getting really forceful with saying \"Any thing, I'll take a dollar. How about Baht? I'll take Baht.\" That's when we were like \"You'll take Baht? You mean your school right? You're volunteering right?\" He didn't like us trying to tell him how to run his little scam operation. All through out Angkor we encountered this...I'm kind of surprised I'm not reading more reviews about this...as they are literally everywhere! I would say if you are strong willed, can just turn a blind eye and deaf ear to it all, it's still worth going to enjoy the wonder of the temples."

It is recommended to get a guide (or, if you prefer, a book on the temples - there are many available in Siem Reap, even at the temples, just haggle a bit on the price if you buy at the temple!) as there is a lot of history you wont know about by just walking around and looking at the impressive structures.

Doing it in that order also seemed like a smart plan as we were almost all alone everywhere (except sunrise and sunset and some people at ta prom). So don't listen to \"you can't do it in one day\", at least not if you are young and healthy and can climb the stairs quite easily. Don't forget to bring clothes that cover your knees and shoulders when walking in some part of the temples. I advise you to bring it though and take it off in between in order not to faint because of overheating..."

The one thing that my friends and I noticed was each temple was very unique in and of itself, even if you do all the temples in one to two days or even 1 to 3 days you will not get bored. There's so much to see, so much detail, and an intense amount of history involving Buddhism and Hinduism. At Bayon you can climb into the temple and for you instagramers and selfie takers--- you'll find all sorts of open terraces and windows to take gteat pictures. Recommend going early in the morning to avoid high volumes of tourists and Chinese tour buses.Note1: Take a bike! They're $1usd and most come with locks, not that you really need them. Some routes/circuits are 10-12km, but you obviously don't have to follow the recommended three day tours. Biking allowed us to observe daily life in the rural areas outside the temples as well as Siem Reap as a whole.Note 2: do not go ticketless! They will fine you. Grab tickets en route to the temple roads, on your right approx. 3km before arriving at a fork in the road. Angkor is to the left of the fork. Note 3: Money is changed in USD, Cambodia uses the reil as change, like cents. Note4: snack stands and beverages available near Angkor Wat - restaurants too, and vendors line up near other temples. Prices slightly elevated but it's not ridiculous inflation."

The temple itself has been greatly restored, and there are endless photo opportunities as you climb the various parts of the temple. Be warned, though, that the stairs are very steep and very shallow, so it can be physically challenging to climb, and I wouldn't want to try them in the rain. You can get a picture of yourself nose-to-nose with one of the giant Buddha heads (if your guide doesn't suggest it, one of the guides wandering around the temple will). There are elephant rides around the temple grounds, if you're into that sort of thing. Bayon is not as well-known nor as frequently photographed as Angkor Wat or Ta Prohm, but still well worth a visit."

However, the number of structures within the small area make it more impressive.However, what made me curious the most is the architecture. If you look inside any towers that have the Buddha face on it, you would see it is just a big stone stacked in pyramid position and lean against each other to stabilize it, without any mortar. To think that such a big monument can survive more than 9 centuries with just basic physics law is just mind blowing.This is one of the big three temples so do not miss the opportunity to visit the Bayon temple."

A \"must see\" when you come to Siem Reap."

There are many different facets to it inside and outside and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring its interesting structure and photo taking even without being professionals. If you want to learn anything about the temples beyond what you see with your naked eye, you must go with a licensed guide. Do not miss! We easily spent an hour here on our own."

It sits in the middle of a 'square roundabout' \u2013 there are no walls surround this temple.It is visually stunning, with the faces and the towers. But don't stop just there, there are nooks and crannies downstairs, below the faces. Unlike the 'temple-mountains' around Angkor (the ones that rise up to over 20 metres, with steep steps), the Bayon isn't built high and therefore no steep climbs. Well, ok, just a little one, of about 10 steps.It is a photographer's paradise, so take a spare battery! You can cover this temple in less than an hour, and during rainy season, take a brolly or raincoat as there is no cover.A real must-see of a temple, it won't disappoint!"

Before you leave the temple, do not forget to take a reflection picture of the temple beside the lake. It will look awesome!The only downside I dislike is the unlicensed pretend-to-be tour guide. Try to avoid locals who OFFER TOUR GUIDE around the temple who do not wear the \"tour-guide\" uniform (pinkish uniform) - normally they will just wear in plain clothes. They don't really know the history of the temple. All they know is to bring you around the temple and point to the sculptures that worth picture taking. At the end they will ask for donation. I find it is totally unworthy to pay for nothing. Please do not fall into the trap although they are kind enough to show you places to take picture.

The middle part of the temple was extended during the second phase of building. The Bayon of today belong to the third and last phase of the art style.The architectural scale and composition of the Bayon exude grandness in every aspects.

The faces carved into the stone were amazing and each one had a particular expression like the face of compassion. We didn't have a guide or guide book but I would have loved to learn more about the temple; recommend bringing one. The stones were mottled grey, black and green giving Bayon a beautiful appearance. If you're visiting Angkor Wat it's definitely worth going to see Bayon and the rest of Angkor Thom as well."

They tell a story and if you're familiar with Cambodian/Khmer history as well as India, China and Siam; that will help. Of course the Mahabharata leaves an imprint. Be sure to read up ahead so that it all makes sense. Needless to say, it was overcrowded for some good reason on the day we were there. Cameras were clicking and people were posing all over the place. We had to wait to click some good shots in the popular designations. What surprised me was the fact that it was supposed to be ancient ruins but we spotted blocks of building materials being assembled. The local markets too had artefacts that looked a ancient. Authenticity has to be verified here; unlike Angkor Wat. A hat is advised to shield you from the brunt of the sun. Dress code is what you decide. The local girls dress rather conservatively and are soft spoken. The men are almost always polite and helpful. However, the onus is on you to be vigilant at all times with your belongings. Cambodian boasts of low violent crime rates. This temple is inactive with perhaps one or two places with active shrines. You may want to get blessings from the Buddhist priest or bypass this altogether. The atmosphere is one of a tourist spot rather than a place of worship. Cambodia thrives on tourism and the government takes the initiative to maintain good washrooms and cleanliness almost everywhere- give and take the agricultural mentality of the heart of Cambodia. "

Built by a different king some 70 years after the construction of Angkor Wat, it houses several temples - the most notable of which is Bayon Temple, located right at the center.Smiling Buddhas are found on all 4-sides of each pagoda or tower. There are numerous pagodas across Bayon Temple and a central tower located in the center.Another recommended temple within the cluster of Angkor World Heritage sites to visit during your trip to Siem Reap!"

If a Cambodian comes up to you and start explaining about the history, please be wary. There is definitely no free lunch in the world. Try to have an agreed price with him or if you don't need a guide, just reject him. However, some of these guides are very knowledgable, albeit a little difficult to understand with the Cambodian accent. I enjoyed the experience with the guide I had as he was knowledgable and patient with my silly questions. I didn't know that he was charging, so by the end of the guide, he just ask me to tip him with whatever amount."

We visited the Bayon temple with our guide Pheat Sinath from hanuman Travel and this I think out of all the temples is my favourite, it is stunningly detailed and utterly unbelievable that people could create this temple so long ago, there must be hundreds if not thousands of faces of Jay 7 in this temple and all of them hand carved are almost identical I would have gladly wandered around here all day.Our guide was fantastic and truly knowledgeable even knowing the best parts of the temple to go to to get the best photo.A truly wonderful temple shown to us by a truly wonderful guide."

I could see that they did try to restore the temple back to its former glory, and I must say, they did a great job. Upon entering the temple, I kind of got scared because the stairs are so steep, and the landings are quite narrow. I had to face sideways to avoid slipping.Again, for some reason there were parts of the temple that smelled like someone peed. There were also some tourists who climbed off-limits area and looked like they don't care as long as they were able to take pictures."

Although I am not the spiritual type of person, I found this very very SPECIAL. Just wondered when Dr Jones would walk around the corner."

Bayon Temple is a must-see, but no worries - it's impossible to miss, as your tuk tuk driver (if you've hired one) will definitely take you there on your Angkor Wat & Angkor Thom tour. If you are cycling or hopping on a motorbike, it's hard to miss as well - Bayon is the epicentre of the ancient temple city of Angkor Thom. The bas relief status of Buddha's faces are the main attractions here, of course - if photography is an interest of yours, there are plenty of chances for some interesting angles of mythical stone faces carved out 900 years ago. Just avoid the tripod, as you might get told off by park wardens. There are multiple entrances to the temple, try and walk the perimeter of it once before you enter so you can decide which entrance to take - usually the less touristy one appeals better."

Bayon's distinctive stone faces on the stone towers are probably the most recognised 'faces' in Siem Reap. The structures' architecture are strikingly different compared to Angkor Wat. Bring an umbrella or poncho and a good hat plus plenty of drinking water and allocate a good 2 hours For photo-buff, do visit early in the morning or late in the evening for better lighting and colors and less crowd. Though Bayon temple is no longer an active temple, there are still a few altars scattered around the huge complex dedicated to Lord Buddha. Hence practice some respect to the holy site"

These are slowly being restored. The galleries are lined with splendid bas reliefs depicting battles in intricate detail, dancers, and other images in wonderful condition.This temple was originally dedicated to the Hindu Vishnu, and an image of him survives in one of the galleries. We made offerings at one of the Buddha images in one of the upper towers. Many pilgrims were doing the same.

Mostly you have to climb up to get a great view of the grounds. Outside of the first temple you will find various other temples to explore. Our Tuk Tuk driver provided a map which was helpful. Our two other favorite structures in that square was the Elephant Terrace and the Leper King Terrace. Elephant Terrace had a beautiful view as you walked along the road while still atop the temple. Leper King Terrace provides a free place to pray with incense and it is much more peaceful than other options around town. A word of caution: You will find that there will be children moving through the halls fishing to get you to tour with them. After showing you some places they will ask for money. The one that stopped us was equipped with a letter that discussed a \"school\" of sorts that teaches impoverished youth to give these tours. The letter, however, was not well edited amd spoke in sort of broken English so it made us question the validity of the script. We gave the child a couple dollars for his time (and because it's so hard to say no to children- and they know it). Many children, however, collect money becuase peiple are more apt to givr to them and will unfortunately have to turn any profits over to their parents/guardians who probably will not use it for the well being of their children. At one temple we offered the children filtered water and gum instead of money and they were just as happy if not happier than receiving our money."

The sheer number of faces beaming at you as well as the ones hidden in plain sight is nothing less than a riddle. The carvings on the walls are exquisite and have a lot of stories to tell. People who are really interested in the history would definitely go into overdrive mode. We visited the temple early in the morning at around 7 am and had the whole temple to ourselves....as this is when majority of the crowd is at the Main Angkor Wat temple. If you prefer solitude while experiencing the artistry, go early in the morning. The view from the top is something else. And u wont realise how time flies up there."

My guide Believes the faces are a combination of the face of the Cambodian Khmer king Jayavarman VII who built the temples, and Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion. The international efforts to restore the temples has been very successful, and continues. If only those countries who stole the treasures would return them to the Cambodians, where they belong. It is a beautiful site, and at the time we went, quite peaceful. There are also many wall carvings of wars with the Vietnamese Chams, as well as carvings of everyday life.

Though the temple was built as the last state temple in Angkor as a Mahayana Buddhist shrine, some scholars believe that the shrine may be paying more homage to the founding/creating King Jayavarman VII than Buddha himself, as there seems to be a keen resemblance between the 216 faces and the god-like king with the name meaning victorious warrior. Don't get swept up by the grandeur of this temple, though. It also serves a nice backdrop for playful pictures. A great photographer and guide can be found here: www.angkorbesttourguide.comContact Narin via email: narinviptours@gmail.comHis knowledge and humor are unmatched, and he also provides a keen eye for great photography spots!Also, don't forget to explore Victory Gate as you exit the city (Angkor Thom).

We had already done Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm and my husband and I were a little weary at this point. (I was thinking back to the hotel for a swim/lunch/rest and my husband was templed out). Our fantastic guide Ramon (we thoroughly recommend him) gently persuaded us to do a quick trip through Bayon (my husband hadn't been before) and we were really glad we did. Everyone should get a \"face to face\" photo - which looks like you are nose to nose with one of the temple faces, and it's very different to Ta Prohm and Angkor Wat. I think if you are staying a few days and can pace yourself with the temples - not try and do too many in one day - you will get more out of it and enjoy it more."

It is one place that should be in everyone's bucket list alongside Angkor Wat. I have been lucky enough to visit twice and I am still seeing new and amazing things. You can ride an elephant through the gates of Angkor Thom to the Bayon Temple. These elephants are rescued from heavy logging work. I suggest you visit the Angkor museum before you go to the temples, as you will have a much better understanding of what you are seeing. Remember both Angkor Thom (where Bayon is sited) and Angkor Wat are still religious sites so be respectful in your dress and behavior. We were very lucky to have Mr Panha from Siem Reap Angkor Car and Tuk Tuk Service as our driver during our ten days in Siem Reap. He provided us with both an air-conditioned comfortable car for those sites further away and fun tuk tuk for sites near Siem Reap such as Bayon. As two women travelling alone in Cambodia, it was good to have Panha as we know he is honest, trustworthy and reliable. He has a chilly bin full of free bottled water with ice in both the car and tuk tuk. Mr Panhan does not do Angkor Archaeological park guiding but he can guide you at Mt Koulen etc. There are plenty of guides waiting at the park. But if you want a safe driver and English speaking guide Mr Panha is your man contact him on (+855) 12 86 45 81, (+855) 975085708 or E-mail and face book panhachhouk@yahoo. He will drive you to see the sunrise at Angkor at 5am and to the Phare circus at 8pm no matter what you need he\u2019s there. He will help you get tickets for all of the attractions including the Angkor Archaeological Park including the Bayon Temple which is also where the Terrace of the Lepper king and Elephant Terrace. If you want to travel responsibly try this idea. On your way into Cambodia you are unlikely to have your full quota of kgs of luggage. Most airlines offer 30kgs but most people take nearly empty suitcases into the country and fill them while they are there. Don\u2019t take a half empty suitcase into Cambodia, fill it up with children\u2019s books, educational toys (no battery operated toys), toothbrushes, soap, shoes, technology items and other useful things. The items don\u2019t need to be new, just in good working condition. Please don\u2019t take lollies or sugary stuff and don\u2019t offer religious items, Cambodians have a diversity of religions available to them, let them choose. You can ask your hotel to distribute the items or take them to the Children\u2019s Sanctuary. If you are lucky enough to have Mr Panha as your driver, then he will know where the most need is and help you get your items to the right place. You don\u2019t have to go along if you don\u2019t want to, just hand the stuff over and then you can fill your suitcase with amazing t-shirts and other souvenirs. If you want to go when there is hardly anyone there try the off-season May to August its very hot (up to 38C or 105F) and can be very dry or very wet but there are no tourists and less pressure to buy souvenirs as there are less sellers. Fewer tourists means better photos. You can expect to see troops of Macaques on the way into Angkor Thom and bats in the darker areas of Bayon, you may smell the bats before you see them. Beware there are young people at the temple asking you to donate to their school, you should beware public education in Cambodia is basically free until high school, although costly private education is available. If you want to donate money for a school, go to the school and donate, don't give to people in the street or at temple sites. Also the young woman in town asking for money to buy milk for her baby, actually sells the milk back to the shop and use the money for herself. Be careful she can get aggressive, do not support this activity there are plenty of really needy people, usually those with no limbs due to land mines, be careful and pick who you help."

The Bayon Temple, within the borders of the ancient city of Angkor Thom, is one of the most majestic temples in the Siem Reap area of Cambodia. My husband and I just got back from a 10 day trip that focused only on this area. We visited many temples, sometimes several a day. Bayon is one of my top 5 temples in the area - vying for first place with Angkor Wat and Banatay Srei. The huge faces peer down from heights at every angle - showering you with serenity. They are beautiful works of art that present the peaceful air of a Buddha. The architecture is incredible for it's day, and the carvings are magnificent - especially considering that they were likely done in situ. I can just picture the master carvers perched on rickety scaffolding chipping away at the huge stone blocks, high in the air, to create these masterpieces. It is a lovely place to spend some time meditating or just contemplating your place in this world. The faces also adorn all of the gates into Angkor Thom, giving you their loving looks as soon as the gates come into view. Currently, you can climb several levels and get up close and personal with may of the faces. This opportunity probably won't last much longer as time and tourists are taking their toll on these ruins. While the faces are superb, the temple itself is majestic, and all of the other carvings are not to be missed, especially the large wall murals. We did the temple, then went back and took an elephant ride around the perimeter - a totally different perspective of this beautiful masterpiece. Depending on the time of year, the best time to see this temple will vary. Check with a tour guide or your hotel for advice. It is better to visit when the crowds are smaller. Go soon - Bayon, as well as all of the other temples in the area, is a sight not to be missed. Add it to your bucket list."

We had a guide at Angkor Wat who told us that you don't need a guide to visit the other places and temples, I disagree, if you travel all that way to Cambodia why wouldn't you want to understand about it? Very peaceful place full of mystery."

You have several options to come to the temple ether by elephant or by TukTuk...I was able to do both and have a different perspective in each.... In walking among the ruins of the Temple, you feel the life essence of the past and the difference of the present by seeing the various indention of the stone walk ways where countless lives moved and lived and many stories lined the walls....In riding the elephant around the Temple grounds, you actually get a feel of the every day ease of commerce that was lived in the past and see the grand size of the structures of the area...

This is a must visit for everyone. Bayon temple is only 5 km away from Angkor Wat. The best part about visiting this place is to go on a day where the skies are clear and a magnificient blue. That made such a beautiful photo backdrop for us. Should also get a local guide to tell you more about its history. The history of these Angkor temples is both stunning and beautiful."

We took an elephant ride around Bayon - I didn't do research into this beforehand, but I hope the elephants aren't mistreated. Cost $20 a head and you can also take an elephant ride up the hill to Bayon.Could've spent hours exploring Bayon itself, but rushed it a bit as thought we should see other temples nearby, but they weren't a patch on Bayon and it was energy sapping going there and looking around (Baphuon in particular!)."

The Bayon equally stands in its own right as a magnificient piece of architecture. 54 towers decorated with 216 coldly smiling , enormous faces staring out over the Khymer empire. As you walk around, a dozen or more of the heads are visible at any one time - full face or in profile, almost level with your eyes or staring down from up high. They are mesmerising and you end up photographing everything. The crowds are less here than at Angkor Wat as you wander around so it feels far more comfortable. There are steep steps to climb to reach each level but no more than twenty on each staircase. Easily managed. The friezes on the lower levels describe everyday life occurring at this time and are a fascinating insight. Renovation is being done to the temple and it was a living reminder to watch craftsmen carry out age old techniques in the twenty first century. The Bayon still is a wonderful monument."

It is an amazing site, especially when you start to look at the various carvings. Don't forget to look up and see the amazing faces carved in to the buildings. You can make your own way there but it is worth hiring a tuk tuk driver (we did this through our hotel), for your time here as they can be really helpful in identifying the best bits to see. We would also advise reading up on the place before you go as this helps bring it to life and you can then avoid what can be expensive guides. We went in May and it is very hot at this time of the year; you shouldn't let this put you off unless you have problems with heat. The plus side of this time of year is that the crowds are much smaller. Visit and enjoy!"

It is small enough that there isn't a crazy number of other tourists there like Angkor Wat, and big enough that if there are others you can go explore different areas on your own. One piece of advice, unless you like to hear all the little tidbits of information about it, we just took a tuktuk and enjoyed the experience and didn't feel that we \"missed out\" by not going on a tour, but I suppose that also depends on what kind of traveller you are.

There actually are no words to describe the Majestic Beauty of this temple. You can spend hours n hours just looking at the beautiful Buddha Faces. Some say as it was made by Hindu king , its the face of Brahma , everyone has a different story .Please take enough water with you ...and be ready for lots of crowd :(And also go there with enough time on your hands and with a guide.PS- From one specific angle you can sit at a window ledge and pose as if holding the statue in ur palms - ask the security guards if you want to have some quirky pics :)"

Different meanins depending on who you ask. One comment was when praying the front view is for business and wealth, left hand side wisdom, back view is health and the right hand side is for relationships. Another view and one I liked was the four faces represent simplicity, compassion, equanimity and wisdom.The faces are mesmerising. The temple is small compared to Angkor Wat. It is also a bit sad to see it covered, and I include myself among them, hordes of tourists. There is little management of the site with a few guards and a one way system to avoid jams on the staircases you climb up to get a closer look at the four faces. Be prepared for crowds, we visited in the low season and it was packed. There also is work taking place on the site. I expect in a few years time a quota restricting the number of tourists visiting Bayon Temple. Otherwise it will be slowly destroyed by peoples admiration of it. I remember years ago wandering around the Acropolis in Athens with unfettered access. Returning a few years ago there are now restrictions in place to prevent people going up to the columns or wandering around it. Still magnificent to visit. Saying all that Bayon Temple is a beautiful temple and should be on your to do list when visiting Angkor Wat Archeological Park.If you found the review useful I always appreciate a helpful vote."

The last temple to be built in Angkor before the fall of the Khmer empire, its distinctive characteristics is the four-sided stone faces adorning the towers. The feeling I get when I venture into the temple compound is like entering a maze city. It\u2019s small and compact within, and the twist and turns do make you feel like Indiana Jones excavating your next adventure.Ascending to its summit, I found that Bayon seem compact, claustrophobic even. It doesn\u2019t have the wide spaces such as Angkor Wat, and it\u2019s also a smaller temple compared to its more famed brethren. But there are more hidden corners, unknown pathways, dark hallways that make the experience somewhat more thrilling. Almost as if you\u2019re exploring a road less travelled.Taking a last look at Bayon before heading out. One thing to be careful about while in Angkor is temple fatigue. The heat and exhaustion can set in pretty quickly if you try to see too much too soon. I would suggest pacing and explore over several days. Early mornings and late evenings are more bearable and the light is better as well. Mid day from about 10-4 are hot, and extremely bright and you\u2019ll likely get washout photos instead. I think a better way to explore Angkor is to head out to temples like Bayon at sunrise where the crowd is much more focused on Angkor Wat. Rest through mid-day heat and return to Angkor Wat in the late evening. The heat was simply punishing."

I was awed by the sight, of the building, with faces of Lokeshevara peering at us from all angles. It became even more awesome as we walked closer, and stepped into the building. Not too sure if it was the spiritual atmosphere, but I felt a sense of good light in this temple. There are several levels to go too, using steep wooden steps to climb, and at each level, the beauty evolves. We spent the most time at the top tier, where the faces can be seen most closely and clearly. We see some tourists posing for pictures, pretending that their noses are touching that of the sculpture's nose. Do bring lots of water for your visit, as the weather is real hot, and to get good views, one must stand outdoors. Also wear really good fitting shoes, as climbing is needed."

It is the central temple of Angkor Thom which is situated only a short ride to the north of Angkor Wat. A high stone wall (8 m) and a wide moat surround Angkor Thom. There are five entrance gates, the south gate probably gets the most traffic because it admits all the visitors coming from Angkor Wat. The bridge leading up to the gate is quite impressive, it is bordered on either side by a row of gods (devas) or demons (asuras) pulling on a snake, a representation of a Hindu myth of the Churning of the Milk. The gate itself is around 25 meters high with the first smiling faces which you will find everywhere in the Bayon temple and are unique to it. Modern scholars are still debating the identity of the faces, some think they represent Buddha, some King Jayavaram VII and others the Hindu god Brahma. Inside the walls the area is densly wooded with very tall and beautiful trees. The Bayon temple itself is quite compact but with around 40 towers still standing and rouphly 150 smiling faces it is awe-inspiring. It is built three-tiered and features also two galleries with extensive bas-reliefs. They depict scenes from the mythology but also scenes from daily life. You feel you are in a maze with narrow walkways, dimly lit low passages and many corners. And always, after every corner you find more smiling faces. Over the years I have been to the Bayon now three times, but it never lost its original fascination. Definitely a must for every visitor. A tip for photographers: if you visit the temple in the late afternoon (around 4 pm) the light is just perfect and the temple less crowded. In the mornings it is sometimes very misty and the whole sunrise crowd from Angkor Wat falls in like a locust swarm."

We saw this on our last day and what a memorable thing that was! There were not very many people in May so I suggest going during that time, just before the rainy season. We went May 11-13. Hope that helps you in your scheduling!"

Unique aspect of the temples in Siem Reap is that carving was done after placing the stone blocks one over the another. So the lines are clearly visible on the faces. Its an amazing site to see smiling faces all around you. The walls of the temple depict the time and life in Siem Reap at that time - war, crocodiles, kings, monkeys etc.Must visit surreal placeDon't forget to take the nose to nose photo with Avlokiteshwar"

And most of the faces are remarkably well preserved. The Bayon is built on 3 levels, so once again there are numerous stairs to negotiate. Oh, and beware of some low doorways.The Bayon was originally Buddhist, but this then changed to Hindu gods and then back again. Each tower had contained Buddha statues brought there by priests from the various provinces, but over time, these were removed.There are also masses of bas-reliefs carved into the various temple walls. The patterns and scenes depicted are remarkable.The Bayon is most definitely well worth a visit."

Unique in its own right, with many faces of BUDDA . We suggest you hire a guide and private car, especially if you, like us are an older couple, Remember, SIEM REP is in between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, so it is very hot and humid. We came in late APRIL, early May which is still the dry season--- a good time to come before the rainy season.Guides and car are not expensive and well worth it. Get a 3 day pass to see many temples and sites for USD $$ 40 per person. We did several temples in 2 days. A three day pass is the same cost as a two day one."

And yet there is no grafiti, no problem people, nothing to make you feel threatened at all. There are a lot of children begging/sellling small trinkets at many of them. The people of Cambodia are sweet and honest and very kind to tourists."

We came on another day around late morning and the Bayon was absolutely packed. My daughter and I thought the huge faces carved into the stone were beautifully serene. Its a reasonably large temple but we managed to see most of it in the hour before the temple closed.

You have to get closer, and get in to realise its eternal beauty.It became famous not only for the 216 Buddha faces with their Mona Lisa smile, but the beautiful bas-reliefs on the exterior walls of the lower level.Personally I preferred the wonderfully carved bas- reliefs, since I found to see these countless Buddha faces in every direction a bit disturbing.Surrounded by the jungle it is a bit dark and I felt this temple despite its undoubted beauty somehow sinister."

As the sun rose and shaped and changed the shadows on the faces, there was a perfect photo op every few feet. As the time went on and more people arrived, the views were less stunning and you often had to wait to take your photos. We wasted an hour at the bottom looking around, where we could have done it at the end.

While Angkor Wat typically gets all the raves (and much is certainly deserved), I thought the smaller Bayon Temple had more interesting sights; the stone faces and relief carvings for example. Part of it was also still not reconstructed unlike Angkor Wat which, to me, made it more interesting and allowed some imagination to play with the pieces."

It is totally different from Angkor temples in style,design and structure The area is more compact and condition of the structures are good as it is maintained by Japanese experts.There are 2000 giant Buddha heads at the top of 54 towers. Four faces on each tower are believed to be of Lord Buddha and signifies the omnipresence of the king. It was believed to be built by King Jayavarmana7 in late 12th century,about 100 years after Angkor Wat. It is learnt from an inscription that it was the central temple of worship in the capital city of Angkor Thom.The deity is Bodisatwa Avolokiteswara. However, some Hindu influence is also seen at places. Two big bas reliefs are also seen here.The columns are decorated with the figures of 3 dancing apsaras.All massive stone heads look alike with broad forehead, lowered eyelids, thick lips and wild nose.There were less number of tourists in this temple unlike Angkor Wat and Ta Phrom. Unlike other two temples, there is no entry fee here A calm tranquillity prevails here that filled me with awe and respect for those who built these impressive creations so many years ago with primitive tools and implements"

Bayon is famous for its 4-faced towers, with huge smiling stone faces dubbed by some as the \"Mona Lisa of South East Asia\". At one point, the temple was host to 49 such towers; now sadly, only 37 remain with apparent signs of deterioration. The number of faces is approximately 200, but since some are only partially preserved there can be no definitive count. Why this is my favourite site in Siem Reap, despite Angkor Wat being a more architectural marvel, is because of the surreal ambiance it seems to exude. One feels as if transported into a seemingly unreal bygone era; or like being cast on a movie set, especially when the area is glazed by the setting sun. The apparent look of meditation (maybe compassion) cast on the unfazed sandstone faces, with eyes closed, create an atmosphere of repose, when the crowds are gone and all one hears are the birds singing on their way home to their nests."

I think no matter what time you go, it will be busy with tourists. We spent about an hour and a half strolling through the ruins and then afterwards walked to the Baphuon, which is nearby. TIPS:Visit the Bayon as part of a visit to the overall Angkor complex.Car and driver for the day is around USD 30. It's useful hiring a car/driver as it gets very hot and the air-conditioned car is a welcome place to rest in between temple visits. One day entrance fees to the Angkor complex is USD 20 per person. Multi-day passes are also available. Watch out for the monkeys. Don't clamber over the temple ruins - stay on the paths. This is a temple under restoration. No need to take shoes off at the temple.Wear a hat (there is little shade at the top of the temple) and take water - it gets really hot."

Stairs ( like ladders!) climb high into sky up to the parapets around the top of the temples or descend down into the passage ways and rooms below. You will definitely get a workout at this site. Remember to wear your joggers or good walking shoes and to dress appropriately so you are not denied access into the sacred areas. Women must have legs and shoulders/neck area covered. There are some more ruins and interesting areas along a marked track that wanders through the bush surrounding the major temples too and it is very peaceful (& cooler) walking along the track. There are a few vendors selling water and fruit at the end of the track or around the parking area too so you can always grab a bite to eat before you head off to you next stop."

From the gate, you can go to Bayon temple by bus (for around 20 people, mainly tour) or tuk-tuk, by bike, etc. But I prefer going there (and all the places in Angkor) by tuk tuk since you can catch the whole beautiful view of Angkor. This place is super beautiful and breathtaking. There are 54 monuments which represents 54 provinces of Cambodia in the past and things on the rock are still remained through time. The only thing that distracted me from enjoying the Temple is people. Too crowded! I suggested you shouldn't go there in the peak time of tourism (February and summer) cause you can't enjoy that much."

Lots of mobile stalls selling ice cream and fruits to pause and recharge before the long walks along the parapet of the walls of the temple."

There's the largest temples Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm temple with the beautiful trees, and Bayon temple with the best faces of Buddha in the whole complex. As you enter the temple area, you pass over these large bridges and beneath these huge gates, each capped with a giant face of Buddha. Inside the temple is covered with giant lotus blossoms and faces of Buddha. My only recommendation for the whole temple area is to drink lots of water and design your own tour schedule. Most of the tours tend to start at the same temple and follow the same route, so you will be stuck following around LARGE tour groups and unable to snap any good photos."

It is famous for the hundreds - estimated to be over 200 - of serene and massive smiling faces carved out of stones which make up the many towers of the temple. Bayon is also known also for two richly intricate sets of bas-reliefs, which many say are a combination of varying mythological and historical scenes. So don't miss these bas-reliefs. This temple is truly a must-see. It represents a period in history, which tells the story of the rich culture and architecture - very similar to baroque - of that period of time. We had a guide with us, so we were able to get a lot of information on the stories behind many of the carvings and bas-reliefs. This site gets to be very busy, so a late afternoon or early morning visit is recommended especially during the hot months of the year (March to August). Some visitors take the tuk-tuk to get here, but joining a tour would be preferable. The temple was built in a compact way so it is not as expansive or grand like the Angkor Wat. But be prepared to do some climbing and walking."

The temple was set in beautiful landscape and although much of the temple has crumbled, the symmetrical shape of the vast temple is mind boggling considering the technology present during the realm of the ancient Khmer kingdom. As for photography, I reckon the best time is in the afternoon when the Bayon reflects colours of amber and gold due the intense light from the sun on a good day. You can expect postcard quality photography as a result of natural colours from the surrounding greens. Don't bother with the free-lance photographers in and around the temple complex. The quality of photography has been compromised with tourist's money."

            "review": "A Fascinating Angkorian Temple Experience. The Angkor Thom Temple was a vast area, so we were taken to the middle where the Bayon temple is located. Our Tuk-Tuk driver told us this was the most significant part and we weren\u2019t disappointed. The temple contains 54 towers and 216 huge stone faces of Avalokiteshvara (the Buddha of compassion), with various myths saying that they also look like the King himself. Walking around in the temple is slightly unnatural \u2013 wherever you go, whatever you see there is always a huge stone face looking down at you with a strange smile. Legends suggest it was a reminder to his subjects that the king was always watching them.What we adored about the temples was the rustic and atmospheric feel, the intricate details of the carvings and the rich history of the Angkorian temples. The stones are placed at such precision and complex interlocking shapes, that it is impossible to fit even a single piece of paper between them. Whether you have one week or one day in Siem Reap, I would definitely recommend coming to Angkor Wat and seeing the famous Angkorian temples. Unlike other modern temples in Thailand and other parts of Cambodia, these aged temples offer more dramatic and atmospheric views. Many people told us we would need a minimum of three days for the temples which would cost $60 (per person) and around $60 (for a Tuk-Tuk driver for three days). We were able to see most of the large temples, stop off at the smaller ones and even had time for ice cream and lunch before the sun set over the temples in just one day. The day ticket is only $20 (per person) and if you arrive around 7:00am, you will have more than enough time to visit the temples including Angkor Wat. There are absolutely loads of temples though, so if these are your thing then a multi-pass deal might be for you.If arriving to Siem Reap by bus, avoid at all costs the locals who almost pounce on you at the bus station. Their prices are extortionate compared to the services your hotel will offer. One local tried selling to us, thinking I didn\u2019t understand the exchange rate. When calculating this in my head I told him no and he got very aggressive and shouted something in Khmer as we left the station. Their selling tactics are very hard sell \u2013 they don\u2019t give you time to think and before you know it you\u2019re reaching for your wallet. Speaking to many travellers on our journey we have heard many similar stories."

Totally agreed but i gonna give you some tips on what to prepare for the trp- Which temple to visit? There are tonnes of temples around but tell ya, after a while you will get so sick of all the temples. Choose only 3 temples. Angkor Wat, Tombraider's temple and Bayon Temple. Look i cannot even figure out which temple is which so i guess everyone single one looks the same anyway. Leave the rest out and dont even bother going to the sunrise. Who pays to watch the sunrise and sunset in this world? Go figure! There are free sunset and sunrise back home, dude!- Bring lots of water and forget about a hat. Bring an umbrella. Oh boy, Cambodia is hot..truly hot. Hotter than Bangkok. I can tell you i have never been in such hot country in my life, Cambodia hits the spot. Also if you could bring a fan or those electric fan, by all means, bring one. Put some sunscreen on,- Not a lot of people mentioned that you will need American dollars wherever you go. It is all about american dollars here. The entrance fee was charged in American dollars, street sellers charge you USD$3-$5 for a Cambodia t-shirt. Make sure you have enough American dollars. - Food...yeap pretty much you dont need them. You need water the whole time. The weather gets so hot that you cannot even bring yourself to eat. You will only want water the whole time. - Wear a really really good pair of walking shoes. This is the one thing that everyone should know. It does look like there are lots of good pavement to walk but when you want to climb up those stairs to the top of the temple, you need good pair of shoes.- Be prepared to be harassed by street sellers the whole time. They get on to your face so close that you cant do anything about it. Just turn them down politely.

Makes you think how did they have the skills.Usual running of the gauntlet of people/young kids who would not leave you alone but as the kids from Grange Hill said in the 80's.........JUST SAY NO!Anyhoo, I was well worth it and not to be missed. ;)"

It's impressive, very high and covered with very complex carvings, besides the giant faces it's famous for.Walking up and downs and entering so many rooms, I felt like I was in a Cambodian version of the library describe in \"The Name of The Rose\" - each room and corridor has a meaning, that most of us are unable to understand. And it's so easy to get confused with all the rooms! Differently from other temples, this one does not follow a square shape, so you'll find curve here and there.Certainly worth a long visit."

This is the temple of the four smiling faces: each tower is surmounted by four smiling faces, each looking out to one of the cardinal points - there are hundreds of them. Good time to visit is late afternoon because the low sun turns the temple's stonework into reddish colours.Like Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm, the other main temples in this cluster, Bayon is extremely busy with tourists for most of the day. So, if you have plenty of time in Siem Reap, take a guide and driver out for a long drive to the Koh Ker group of temples and Beng Mealea - hardly any tourists go this far so, suddenly, you can enjoy the tranquility of temples without the shrieks of other tourists only interested in taking selfies with the now ubiquitous selfie stick. Allow at least 10 hours for this trip and budget about US$140 for the car, guide and driver."

Went around 9 in morning, and experienced large (somewhat pushy) crowds. Walkway well marked but some areas have narrow passageways. If on tour you may have to change busses due to narrow openings for passenger traffic. Beautiful carvings and can still view many of the faces of the temple. Beware of all the persistent locals wanting to sell Cambodian travel books and photos."

FYI It costs $20 per person, not per elephant and you walk around the whole Bayon Temple. The temple itself was amazing although appropriate footwear is recommended, as walking around isn't easy with steep steps and uneven surfaces everywhere. This is the temple with lots of smiling buddha faces. The carving on the walls are amazing, be sure to have a tour guide with you to tell you some of the stories from the pictures - some are very interest and can give you a lot of insight into the history and culture. It's much harder to appreciate walking around on your own."

We visited Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm, Pre Rup, Banteay Samre and Banteay Srei, and I am quite positive the Bayon Temple was my favorite. While it doesn't match the Angkor Wat in sheer size, I loved the multitude of Buddha faces. The temple had so much character. Its' antiquity, size, and structure were awe inspiring and majestic. We couldn't pick a favorite face. We loved them all! As we walked closer to the towers, we were able to see how intricate and unique the details were on each face. No two faces were the same (and there were 216 in its' glory days!!!) While I am unsure on how many stood proud, they appeared countless and each one was extraordinary.Remember that temple attire is required, which means no bare shoulder and at least no bare knees (I wore lightweight pants to be safe). It's hott! Really hott!! Wearing a hat or bringing an umbrella for shade might not be the worst idea. The temples are incredible though, so the heat is worth putting up with. If possible, hire a private guide so you can tour the temple at your own pace and you're not stuck at the pace and whim of others in a large crowd. Our guide's name was Dy with ICS Travel and he was absolutely phenomenal. He provided us with such fabulous insight and shared his knowledge with us with such charisma. I would truly recommend both Dy and ICS Travel."

It's impressive to see so many carved faces and in relatively good condition. We went there at about 4pm, just one and a half hours before closing time at 5.30pm and it was not very crowded. It was also a good time to take nice pictures of the setting sun shining on the carved faces, turning them to a beautiful warm amber. There are a few stairs to climb, the steepest being to the highest level. As most of these temples are still used by the locals as places of worship, it would be respectful to dress appropriately. Knees and shoulders should be covered. I saw a few women wearing dresses and skirts. Although they were below the knee, it's best to remember that some of the stairs can be quite steep. Not only could they hinder your climbing, they could also leave little to the imagination for those climbing behind you."

I was there at 8 am but many visitors were already there. After 9 am, the temple got very crowded with tour groups. The exit area was thankfully not crowded at all at 10 am and you can get a nice panorama photo.  The floor of central tower area is no longer level, and my guide suggests that at some point in the future, the area must be cordoned off for major reinforcement work. Better view it now!"

The name Siem Reap means \"the defeat of Siam\" as the Khmer Empire became so powerful at the height of it's construction, they defeated the Siamese (which became Thailand). Built in the late 12th or early 13th century as the official state temple of the Mahayana Buddhist King Jayavarman VII, the Bayon stands at the center of Jayavarman's immense capital, Angkor Thom. Following Jayavarman's death, it was modified and augmented by later Hindu and Theravada Buddhist kings in accordance with their own religious preferences. Amazingly over a million people are though to have been living in this area at the time of its construction and peak of the Khmer Empire. The Bayon's most distinctive feature is the multitude of serene and massive stone faces on the many towers which jut out from the upper terrace and cluster around its central peak. The temple is known also for two amazing sets of bas-reliefs, which present an unusual combination of mythological, historical, and everyday-life scenes. We spent a few hours just admiring this Temple in all its beauty, the only spoiler was the incessant cries of the sales children who are used by their controllers to pester the tourists with postcards and other trinkets for sale. I doubt that very much money makes it back to the children themselves and it is a sad reflection on the society that allows these peddlers to continue to use young children in such a way."

The tuk tuk rental for the first day was $39 and I think it is $ 40 to visit Beng Mealea . The price list for tuk tuk will be in the room or the font desk can provide it., if you are solo you have the option to take the mini bus etc .. check with the front desk.The name if my driver was Toluah and his number is 0886644479.

I did not expect to like it as much as I do, but I would come back here again.Don't be content with following the tour path, which mostly goes through the upper levels near the giant faces. You can explore a bit more in the lower levels and around the outer walls. Finding your way through the maze of corridors in the lower levels is exciting.Tip: Most tourists go with a tour schedule, which is either starts at 5:00 AM for sunrise or 8:00 AM for those too lazy to get up early. Both starts at Angkor Wat, and more tourists start at 5:00 AM. It will take them some time to explore Angkor Wat and move on to the other temples. So after seeing the sunrise at Angkor Wat (around 5:45-6:00 AM), go directly to Bayon and the other Angkor Thom temples. This is the best way to get ahead of the other tourists and avoid crowds. They will catch up with you at around 9:00 AM, but by then you will be moving on to Ta Prohm."

Our guide was superb and really knew her stuff, giving us a very in-depth history of the era and construction of the temples. She also gave us plenty of time to take photos, even suggesting some interesting shots like trying to make your face line up with the faces on the towers of Bayon Temple so it looks like you're kissing which was great fun. Well worth the visit and I would recommend this trip to anyone."

In all, there are are total of more than 11,000 carved figures over 1.2km of wall.

It was late in the afternoon and the sky above the area was swollen gray. We hurriedly took to the stairs with the intention of making it to the top tier when all of a sudden the rain fell. Good we found a dry nook on the western portion of the ruins where 3 Cambodian ladies were taking shelter. We found out later that they were there to do some janitorial services. My wife offered them some candies and their conversations started. There was a small window-like opening to my right where I could see the road and the tuktuks and cars passing by from afar and I figured the nook must've been a part of an ancient room. I was in that state of daydreaming when the rain finally stopped. I was so enamored with this temple that on our way back to the hotel, I made it a point to drop by a roadside art shop to buy an oil painting of the Bayon. The painting now hangs in our home as a special memento of that \"love at first sight\"."

The only bad thing about this that they beat the poor elephants on their heads so that they walk the right direction. This was a bit awful for me and I barely stood it. But except that everything is just fine.Also be careful just before the entrance to this temple because there are monkeys there, which can steal your bag, keys, camera, ect.

If you want to take a more leisurely pace then you can buy a 3-day ticket ($60 so no saving other than queue time) or you can come back and buy another 1-day ticket (the way to go if you don't want to do temples consecutively). The temperature in Cambodia gets very hot very quickly (by 930 it is brutally hot) so make sure you use plenty of sunscreen and take a hat. The biggest challenge in the temples is the tourists...blocking paths and walkways in search of the perfect photo opportunity (especially true at Ta Prohm).

I think Bayon is definitely the most grand, most impressive, and most breath-taking temple of them all, far surpassing Angkor Wat. I wondered why Angkor Wat was so frequently mentioned and commonly known, while Bayon is not, and the answer I got was that the Cambodian government heavily promoted Angkor Wat, but not Bayon. I think Bayon is the true gem of Siem Reap. The #1 attraction, #1 temple of Siem Reap. While I found all the temples to be quite impressive and amazing, my favorite is Bayon because it is so distinct, different, and easily recognizable. It has many towers, and each tower has a large, smiling face on each of the four sides. They really make this temple stand out from the rest. The temple itself is also very large and magnificent. This is definitely the most awesome and memorable temple of them all, and my favorite."

This is also great because it is a relatively short visit and great to do after Angkor Wat as they are nearby and usually you feel super tired after that excursion as it can be more than two hours.

No thought or time management whatsoever in restoration work.I firmly believe that Cambodia should close all the Angkor sites for a month of the year for restoration work, then pack all the construction work up; just as Machu Picchu is closed for a month of the year. However, this will never happen in Cambodia as the mighty dollar is more important than truly treasuring this amazing area.

The carved heads watching you as you wander seem to need quiet contemplation to really appreciate the beauty of this complex space. I aim to try to find a quiet time and try again."

A ticket is valid for entry to all temples on the complex, you cannot buy a ticket just for one temple. A one day ticket is $20, a three day is $40, and a 7 day is $60. The ticket will have your photo on it so it is non transferable.Outside your hotel negotiate with a tuk-tuk driver to hire him for a day for $20-$25. He will take you around all the temples you want. Pay him at the end of the day. He will wait for you outside each temple.My favourite temple is 'Ta Prohm' (Tomb Raider Temple) where the trees grow through the temple. This is my second favourite temple.As per other comments this temple is the one with many heads and makes for some stunning photos. Over the course of time this temple is doing well and is standing strong, although there is some restoration work going work.Depending on personal choice you can hire a guide to explain to you everything, or you can take a guide book with you and read about it as you stand there, or you can just find somewhere nice to stand or sit and enjoy it for what it is.Even if you have just one day this is a must visit temple"

            "review": "Joint best temple of the entire trip. I must admit, I hadn't even heard of Bayon before arriving in Cambodia although I had SEEN it. I think I'd assumed all temple photos were of Angkor Wat!Whereas Angkor Wat is huge, with well preserved religious carvings and impresses - and exhausts - with it's sheer scale, Bayon is by comparison smaller, easier to relate to and for me at least, much more photogenic.The carvings here relate to daily life rather than mythological events and it's fun looking at the walls and trying to make sense of what's going on. From people playing chess, to farming, you can wander around and continually find little motifs that take a couple of seconds to understand but leave you with a smile when you've figured it out. Spotting Buddha faces is also a good pastime and it's really hard to not keep snapping photos of their serene smiles.So whereas Angkor Wat is the temple that gets all the attention, for me Bayon was better preserved in some places and much more fun to visit. Ta Prohm is also superb, like Bayon, and is the flipside - a temple that HASN'T survived and has been overwhelmed by nature. Definitely make sure you do both.There are no facilities, like with the majority of temples, and nowhere to get food/drink unless you head to the stalls outside Angkor Wat (a good 10 mins drive away). Bring some water with you. On the plus side there are no souvenir-selling annoyances either as they loiter around the bigger name places.For a good photo, after it has been raining, check out each of the four corners of the temple from the surrounding road. You can often get a pretty cool reflection of the temple in the waters nearby.You can also get elephant rides for $15pp from the shops just outside the Angkor complex south gate to Bayon (or back), or an alternate shorter ride around Bayon. The elephants looked to be well cared for and it was nice to be able to stroke them after our ride. Massively touristy but there's something about riding an elephant that's always a bit special.Definitely a highlight of the region"

We were there early in the morning (about 630am) and were amongst the very few people there. Majority of the crowd would be at Angkor Wat during this time. At first it felt eerie, but after the sun rises and we started exploring, it was really peaceful and surreal. Take some time to read up about the whole Angkor Archeological Park and their history before exploring and you'll kinda understand why the Bayon Temple is built the way it is. Why the workmanship is considered crude compared to the works in Angkor Wat.Don't forget to bring sturdy shoes/ sneaker, mosquito repellants, hats and lots of drinking water. Snacks and small breakfast is good too so that you can maintain your energy while climbing. Just remember not to litter. And take your time. The jewels are hidden in the carvings."

The Bayon Temple is famous for its 51 towers with four faces on them. But you should also visit the dancing gallery and see the wall carvings. The ornate carvings depict what life was like in e 12th century with the Cambodian people fighting and playing along side the Chinese. Once you get into the temple it seems like every nook has a view towards one of the many faces of Bayon. As with many of the temples, some destruction has happened. Buddhas have been removed to be replace with Shiva lingas when the Hindus came into power. There are some steep stairs here and if rainy can be slippery."

Another great thing about this temple is that there aren't as many stairs to climb and by the end of the day, this was very welcome.

Originally there where 49 towers but there are only 37 left. There are no words to express the complexity of the structure. The towers with the faces on the top and the winding lanes underneath it are really impressive.

Later after the king\u2019s death, the temple was modified by the following Hindu and Buddhist kings as per their preferences. The most interesting fact about the temple is that when its foundation was laid, the main religious figure was a statue of Buddha which was more than 3m tall and was located in the central tower. But, when the following Hindu kings modified it, the statue was removed and broken into pieces. In 1933 during the restoration work, the pieces were taken out from a well, were placed back together and are displayed in a small pavilion at the Angkor."

Look for the better quality ones that come in different sizes - they are there look for them they are $5 and come in L and XL sizes because all the seams split at the crutch on the cheap ones and you end up with massive chaffing.

On the other hand, while no less dramatic, the Bayon Temple is smaller and more manageable. In that sense, I like to think of the Bayon as the Musee d'Orsay to the Angkor Wat's Louvre.The main attraction of the Bayon are the towers bearing over 200 carved faces of a smiling, compassionate Buddha. The towers are located on the third level of the complex, and are reached via steep stairs. But don't neglect the reliefs on the first level - if you come with a guide, he will bring you through the most important ones. Many are scenes of battles between the Khmers and the Chams (or Chinese - they're the ones wearing headdress), with the Khmers eventually victorious. Other interesting scenes are that from a river and a circus. We were told that because the temple faces east, a visit at sunrise was the thing to do. However, we visited in the late afternoon when the crowds weren't as crazy."

Two day temple experiences can be arranged at reasonable prices and the entrance fees are 20 dollars for one day and 40 for three. Don't get me wrong, the other temples are beautiful too but this was my favourite!Not sure why anyone would give less than 5 stars unless your indianna Jones!"

Bayon is amazing as were a lot of the smaller temples which are all part of Angkor Thom. For me these temples were better than Angkor Wat although I did go back to Angkor Wat for the sunrise which was well worth it. As the temples are so far apart it is best to hire a tuk tuk driver over your time there. Great value and extremely knowledgeable. You let them know what kinds of these you want to see and they will take you. Our last stop was at the oldest temple in Siem Reao. We were the only people there. When we said we had finished with the temples our driver talked us into going there. So glad he did. It was one of my favourites. Also buy yourself either a 3 day or 1 week pass."

I loved it so much that I came here for two sunrises. -Try to get here before 9am, after that, its asian tourist world. -Also heard the sunset here is amazing."

I also recommend a local guide/driver combination. We have traveled the world using a guidebook and jumping into buses, tranis or an occasional taxi. but here it makes sense to have someone that adjusts to your schedule as you jump from temple to temple. Plus, by westerners' standards, in it is very affordable. Plus, if you come in August you will have to sort ouut the weather (it rains, hard, every day, usually in the afternoon, sometimes for one hour or more)."

Most people will just climb to the top and pose with the faces, But there is so much more. Explore the lower levels, both inside and outside. There are numerous beautiful bas-reliefs of scenes from history and mythology. There are many tunnel like walkways and passages all around the lower part of the temple, explore them and you will be pleasantly surprised. And of course, there are the 200 odd faces of Jayavarman. Either go to Bayon first thing in the morning or at the end, it takes about two to two and half hours to properly explore the place."

The main draw of course is the faces carved in the rocks, which are plentiful. My wife and I did a few of the rather challenging climbs up to the top of different parts of the temple, which was really fun. Great experience."

These tickets are checked at each destination by staff in blue shirts. So do not lose your ticket.Bayon is an incredible temple to discover.

Expect to climb steep wooden steps, and rough, uneven sandstone blocks. We entered it through it's east gate, where the short walk from the tuktuk parking area is probably the easiest path you'll walk on in the entire structure.Built 100 years after Angkor Wat, it's the next most amazing temple to see after the former, with it's 2000 faces carved on solid rock and 54 towers rising to the sky. It is a Buddhist temple, with pillars, surrounded by 4 faces, representing the omnipresent god. Bas reliefs at the first 2 areas tell of the battles, of a history built upon the blood of it's enemies, and it's people. Personally, it's my favorite temple."

But it\u2019s the #1 temple in terms of history and the awesome stone works left behind by the ancients for us. Build by King Jayavarman VII, this gem of ancient architecture have stood the test of time. Most distinctive feature of this temple is the massive stone faces. We end up going twice in 3 days to Bayon Temple for the serenity and to admire it. :)Tip : Before you go and visit the temples, take a trip to Angkor National Museum and spend 2-3 hours there to explore and find out more about the temples and who build them and when. Museum entry is 15$ and don\u2019t forget to get the audio commentary in English, its worth the additional 3$ you spend. To enter inside the Angkor temple complex (which consist of the hundreds of big and small temples) you need to buy a pass. It\u2019s USD 20$ for 1 days and USD 40$ for 3 days. If you have time and keen on exploring the temples, I would recommend to take the 3 days pass and you could take your own time to see the place and explore it on your own terms."

They will argue with you: \"But....Bayon??!!...you mean Ankor Wat, right? No-one, nobody, wants to go to Bayon for sunrise! Too many trees! Are you sure???\", but you should persevere and get him to take you all the way to Bayon. He's right on all accounts- trees block the eastern horizon and there is NOBODY there (we only saw 2 other people on Bayon up until ~8:00). BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S SO COOL! The blue hour comes and all of the gorgeous, enormous faces of Bayon are bathed in ethereal blue light.

The tuktuk driver usually have a chest of cold bottled water ready to refresh the temple visitor for free.

The chinese have beards and the cambodians have the long ears - fun for the kids and a nice walk through the temple.

I am completely beyond amazed with the detailing that went into building this structure considering the fact that there were no electrical tools and machinery back then. The faces stick in your memory forever. I went to Cambodia in July, which is considered low season. Still, there were crowds as I feel that Cambodia is becoming a booming tourist attraction - especially over these past couple of years. However, I went pretty early and there were less crowds. You do have the opportunity to climb the stairs up certain areas, which is also nice because you can see how everything looks from the top. There were locals dressed traditional Cambodian garments at the top of one area who let you take photos with them. It did take away a little bit from the \"natural\" beauty surrounding us. I really hope the bad traces of tourism doesn't make its way into these temples and in a couple years, I pray to God that there isn't some Starbucks at the very top. Fee: There is a $20/day pass if you go for 2 or 3 days. For one day, I think it's $30/day. Personally, I think that two days is enough for you to see the major temples (and some smaller ones as well)."

No noisy crowd would disturb you in adoring the magnificent details of Bayon. Upon reflecting, I was moved by the patience, dedication, and sacrfice of the workers and builders of this temple.

The temple, however, is now the center of a massive restoration efforts by Japanese and French government and one can see the diggings and the gathering of pieces of relics within the grounds of the temple. The bas reliefs found inside the hallways of Bayon temple speaks of stories of old such as the churning of milk and asparas, the celestial dancers.

The sunset is supposed to be amazing from here but we had monsoon rain which prevented this. However, worth the visit and please wear comfortable shoes (trainers) as the steps are steep and in some cases, small. Also, Angkor Wot main temple does not allow visitors into the site if you are wearing shorts above the knees or vests i.e. sleeveless t-shirts. Shoulders must be covered."

Angkor Thom is more haphazard than Angkor Wat but this gives a definite element of excitement but Bauphon is a hidden gem. Far from the most well known, it's more open than the others and is the only temple (I think) you can climb to the top of, which is not only exciting but affords great views.

Fan-driven but makes no sense, since the Bayon is the central temple of Angkor Thom, and the whole ensemble works together as an integrated microcosm.Comparative ratings of UNESCO World Heritage Sites should be irrelevant. The Bayon is far more chaotic than the central complex of Angkor Wat--not only is it built over a pre-existing cruciform floor-plan, but apparently Jayavarman VII kept changing his mind. At this scale, that must have driven his architects bonkers. While artistically this is deplorable, for the casual Indiana Jones wannabes, it's great fun. While it sure isn't harmonious, it's a heck of a labyrinth! That emerald scarab's gotta be round here somewhere!The selling point is the enigmatic smiling Buddhas. Don't kid yourself about J-7's devotion. I ascribe to the notion that all those smug Buddha faces are his own egotistical images--though the sculptors glossed over his leprosy. And as the model of the mother of Buddha--the Perfection of Wisdom-- his own Mum!Some parts of the Bayon are intrinsically unsafe, such as virtually vertical ancient stone stairways with extraordinarily narrow treads and highly uneven surfaces. Use safety sense, particularly if it's raining."

I recommend any cyclist to start cycling at 4.30am so that you can reach Angkor Wat around 5.15am for the sunrise(Its around 9KM distance). Everyone wanted to catch the sunrise, so it will be crowded at Angkor Wat. Hence, after taking a few pictures for the sunrise, i cycled deeper towards the Bayon Temple. This temple is around 2KM away from Angkor Wat, just straight ahead following the road to more temples. Before reaching the temple, you will cross a bridge, which at the side it was decorated with lots of statues. The gateway at the end of the bridge is a good place for photo too!From what i read, the temple was in ruines when discovered, hence you expect to see most parts of the temple are being reconstructed or renovated. You can climb up the temple and look at the parts above. The sculptures are very beautiful with the local god's face on them. Definitely a good place to go. Totally recommended!"

The Banyon Temple, while large, is smaller than some of the other sites and it can get congested (both inside, and outside where there are a huge number of vendors, tuk tuk drivers, etc.). There is no water surrounding it, so if one must choose where to visit first thing in the morning, this one can be photographed and visited later in the day. Because of the bustle in the area, there are some interesting photo opportunities (such as the tuk tuk drivers \"working\" with the temple in the background)."

It may not strike you immediately, but give it time as you climb up from below and emerge to a forest of faces said to resemble the once great God King Jayavarman VII. Of all the temples of Angkor it is said that Bayon is the most romantic. It's also one of the closest to Angkor Wat. If your time is limited and there are only so many temples you can visit, do yourself a favour and get yourself down to the Bayon!"

The temple is made up of blocks of stone and where you can also spot the gigantic faces of Buddha. No perfect word/s to define the beauty of Bayon Temple with amazing architecture that every block of stone has its own story.

However, we only stayed at Angkor Wat long enough to see the sun come up (we then came back in the late afternoon, around 4p when the sun and the light really highlight the beauty of Angkor Wat). Then, at the advise of our tour guide, we went into the Bayon Temple. Since we were there about 6a it was still very quiet and we had the entire temple to ourselves. Time to explore, take photos, and to finish watching the sun come up. Enjoy! It's a beautiful temple."

The artwork on the outside walls (known as bas-relief) was something at which to marvel. How carving such intricate scenes of Buddhist tales over 1,000 years ago is possible I'll never know. Seeing the faces and, of course, getting a photo with you nose to nose with one of them is cute, but you should certainly go to see stonework on the outside."

You are up close and being just next to them - words cannot explain.

The main temple has four faces each watching over the four points of the compass whilst each of the 51 smaller peaks have their own face sculptures. Basically everywhere you go you seem to be being watched over. The faces themselves, although many worn, are beautifully carved and one or two have kept a superb degree of detail. Indeed the temple below is a wash with historical events carved into the walls and you could spend hours wandering around admiring every one that still exists. This is a fairly compact temple and one which is just beautiful. The faces are surreal. Loved this one and took some time to rest here from the heat ( good shaded areas ) and just admire what was built over nine hundred years ago.

This proved to be quite a good strategy as it is very hot and dusty. This temple was probably the one of the busiest temple we visited during our entire stay. It is huge and takes a long time to walk through. I would recommend a guide to tell you about the temple and its history as it will increase your experience. The face carvings are amazing and plentiful, they are everywhere you turn. This is what differs the Bayon Temple from the others in the complex and it is very well worth the visit."

If you arrive there, you will relax and understand how calm it is. You can see the beautiful green grass around the temple and face with fresh air which can gain more happiness. I had no word to say because it was so great. I would like to recommend others to see Bayon Temple when they visit Cambodia. Let travel together. Thanks."

It does not have the massive scale of Angkor Wat or the ornate charm of Neak Poan but Bayon has the mysterious maze like qualities (mental as well as physical) that defines the enigma of a vanished civilization. It's a relatively small but do not rush through it. I would recommend a whole afternoon to admire the effect if the changing lights. Also do not forget to check out the base reliefs on both the first and second levels as well."

But Angkor wat and temples of Angkor Thom it's something special. Bayon templeis really amazing, giant budda faces is spectacular and monumental and they can make you buddist, be careful ;) The best way to visit it is to have one day trip between Angkor wat and Angkor Thom temples by tooktook: you have your time, you can set priorities and visit that places, what would you like to visit... Also it's cheaper then group trip if you have some friends, normal price for one day trip on tooktook is about $20. But very important to have a good driver, because there is a lot of drivers who don't speak english, or they too lazy to drive some routes, or they don't know Angkor Thom well... In this reason i want to recommend the very nice khmer guy, who can help you to have the best experience in Angkor and Siem Reap. (his english is better then mine))) His name is Phirom, here is his contacts https://www.facebook.com/phirom.kakso (+855)81836396 He will give you a cellphone with khmer sim card, and you will never get lost.

Scenes of everyday life on the Tonle Sap are shown in reliefs on the lower levels. The upper level has the famous towers adorned with huge faces on each side. At the very heart of the temple is a slightly mysterious circular building. When you go inside there is a small Buddhist shrine, incense and a Nun who will bless you.The temple can be crowded, I was here late afternoon and managed to grab a few peaceful moments."

Bayon Temple is sufficiently compact to encourage any order of visit, particularly as the absence of a surrounding wall makes it easy to enter at any point. Not only that, but one of the special pleasures of this unique temple is to immerse yourself in its maze-like qualities.The confusion of the inner enclosure, with its narrow chambers, corridors and stairways, giving occasional surprise glimpses of the enigmatic faces, is in itself a fascinating experience.How much time you spend with the bas-reliefs will depend on your level of interest. I though the S section of the E Gallery and the E section of the S Gallery were the most interesting.Bayon Temple was one of the top five temples we visited."

We saw monkey's which just added to the atmosphere. The bridge is lined with incredible statues representing god's and devils and along with the 4 headed gate make for a dramatic entrance to the temple complex. We hit the temple at around 8am and it was already teeming with tourists-large tourist groups mean you have to wait to climb the stairs and make it more difficult to get the the perfect shot, but overall the site is amazing. There is some excavation being done onsite."

I arrived at Bayon via Tuktuk and almost immediately saw a large monkey prowling around the road and the entrance to the temple. I was very wary of this monkey as it seemed to be stalking me. I put my camera away zipped into my pocket in case the monkey tried to snatch it from me, although when I was through the first doorway into the temple itself I was able to begin taking some cool photos. After the monkey, my next encounter was with a young Khmer man, who was waiting inside the temple, and he advised me that if I stood in a certain exact spot near him I could get a brilliant photo of the temple architecture above. I said I would come back later to take these photos, as I think he may have tried to charge me for the privilege.Probably even more so than at Angkor Wat, I found myself to be intrigued by the architecture here at Bayon, and I don\u2019t mean just the faces. There are many little intricate carvings on the walls, both on the lower levels and up above. I also liked the fact that, unlike Ta Prohm and Preah Khan whose majesties have been somewhat claimed by the power of the jungle, Bayon still has a comprehendible design that can be explored logically. This certainly makes me feel Bayon is a true temple (albeit decrepit), rather than needing to refer to it merely as \u201cruins\u201d."

The approach to Bayon from Angkor takes you over the bridge where ther are statues of 53 Gods and 53 Demons, a lot have replacement heads that compliment the original stonework as the originals were either destroyed or sold during the civil war. We were not too bad with crowds as started at Bayon about 9. Then Ta Phrom approx 1 o clock when crowds heading for lunch, then into Angkor Wat around 2.30 from the east gate and out by the west. Travel was by hire car and driver Mr Samreth Leang, known as Sam, was excellent. He had cold water and cold towels waiting for us on our return to the car and acted as a great source of information, would strongly recommend his services,(Samrethleang@yahoo.com (855)978667664)."

At first we booked a private tour to take us but he cancelled on us at 5am on the day if the tour because of Khmer New Year. Our hearts dropped but luckily one of the amazing tuk tuk drivers jumped in to save the day (Mobe). He asked where wanted to see. Having never been we didn't really know. He said he would take us to Angkor Wat for sunrise and then to the other temples he thought we would want to see. We asked how much... $25 he says. Amazed by the price which was a third of what it would have cost for one of us on the organised tour we agreed. Sunset was beautiful but busy. Not sure if this was just because of new year though. Then we walked around having bought a info book for $15 outside. Be warned they are cheaper inside!!! After this we went back to meet Mobe and went to Angkor Thom. Again looked round for a few hours, had an elephant ride and saw monkeys playing in the trees. The place had an almost magical feel. From we visited four other temples before Mobe dropped us back at our hotel door. The man was a life saver and gave us an amazing trip for practically nothing. Never underestimate the knowledge of the mighty tuk tuk driver, and see angkor wat though the eyes of the locals."

The price of an English translator was US$30 and the car rental US$35. This does not include the admission pass which is US$40 and tip for the driver and translator. Also you may want to make sure you have US$1 bills on you as there are a lot of kids wandering the streets trying to sell tourists post cards, bracelets, etc. They are really too cute to turn away. $1 can go along way for them."

I really enjoyed discovering all the carvings with my guide. He took a great picture of me touching noses with one of the statues, (bit like the hand on the Leaning Tower if Pisa). Without him I would not have known this possibility existed. The faces were incredible, i loved this more that Angkor Wat, the complex is much more intricate, there are, so I was told, 216 faces here, all slightly different. Put this one on your list."

There are 54 towers, each with 4 smiling faces (216 all up) said to be in the image of the Buddha of Compassion. Although still a ruin, it's in better nick than many other temples in the area and you can spend an age here walking around and taking photos. The crowds here can get crazy, especially when a tourist bus or two arrives which although understandable, it's sad as it takes away some of the beauty and tranquility of the place."

It is mind-bending to know that there was so much sophistication in the world so long ago, and that it is still visible to us today. Hated the crowds. Was here three years ago and it was busy then but numbers seem to have almost doubled this time. I would advise getting to the large temples early or late in the day when most of the tour buses and groups are not there. I would definitely recommend hiring a tuktuk for the day as this gives much more freedom and autonomy to move around and choose your route. You can hire a bike and cycle, but this gives you safety on the road while still being able to see the surroundings. "

While archaeologists continue to work at this site, the temple is in a much worse state than the others. The ruins though provide enough signs of how amazing this temple might have been in the past. The pillars with the multiple faces of Buddha all around the temple gives it a very different feel when compared to Angkor Wat. The majestic depiction of the churning of the ocean for nectar at the entrance of the Angkor Thom complex shows that the complex along with all its temples must've been as marvelous a feat as Angkor Wat itself. The only issue with this place is that given its smaller size, crowds are more difficult to navigate."

Then numerous pillars are adorned with the serene face of the Buddha on all four sides. Some speculate that these were modeled after Jayavarman himself. There is a Mona Lisa quality to the expression of the Buddhas as they gaze across the landscape. A great place to sit and meditate or just relax and soak in the serenity."

I was besotted with Angkor Wat for years but was very surprised by the splendour of the Bayon Temple.The number of faces in the temple is amazing, you just keep seeing new ones everywhere you look. I cannot stress how wonderful this temple is. It may be not the most preserved but the sheer size of the ruins and the detail of the faces will blow you away!"

It was around 9 AM on a weekday (after going to Angkor Wat for the sunrise), and when on the top, it was just too many people. I would recommend anyone who goes to try to make it either really early, or later in the afternoon, it will make the experience much better, and let you take in the beautiful site.The guides have a somewhat preset itinerary so they seem to tend to push to having this at around morning. Ask for a better timing!"

It is unique and freaky at the same time. Feels like one is being watched by multiple faces all the the same time.

It is impossible not to think you are the worlds best photo-journalist but.... words simply cannot do it justiceTo get the most from it you have to have the time otherwise you will be left with a sense of 'two religions? funny building, 4 faces, steep steps, next please...' therefore if you have the time get a multi-day pass (we each had the one week pass)After about an hour and a quarter/half the groups were beginning to come in and spoil what I had so I went around the outside. I was lost in my own thoughts when I caught sight of the north side as I came through the trees....lump in throat time, hanky to eye and a quick look over my shoulder to make sure no one could see me!***TIP*** get your ticket for the following day from approx. 1645 the night before - it is an accepted practice and does not eat into the validity of your pass; you can then get to wherever you want to first thing in the morning with little hassle beyond having to get your pass verified"

There are excellent opportunities for photos and sightseeing of theses unique structures. Well worth seeing and spending the limited time that might be available.

It's impossible to resist taking hundreds of photos of this hypnotizing location. There are lots of different angles where faces line up, framed through stone windows that on a good day, are caught by slices of sunlight that cast shadows and patterns which constantly change. At points you will find you're level with the faces so you can stand next to them - but be prepared to wait your turn as the occasional aggressive idiot armed to the teeth with an arsenal of photography equipment is never less than six feet away. The significant thing about Bayon are the carvings on the outer wall that are some of the only recorded depictions of urban life in Angkor. If my memory serves me correctly, some show the pulley systems they used to lift the stones that built the many temples. You don't need a guide, but one can be helpful to take you through the carvings which are actually really good. If you only do Angkor Wat and one other temple, make this that one other temple. This temple is included in the Angkor pass, no extra charges. As with all the temples, how long you need is a piece of string - but at least an hour if not 2. Don't forget to check out the carvings."

Although many people may never have heard of the name Bayon Temple prior to their trip, they will still enjoy a visit there. The temple is relatively small and is easily recognized by the numerous towers with faces. #1 Our group visited just after lunch, which I thought was a great time to see the ruins. The sun wasn't too high in the sky so it wasn't hot and the crowd of people was very manageable. #2 You will have to do a little bit of climbing to get to the main area of Bayon. #3 There are lots of doorways that weave here and there and it can become somewhat overwhelming. #4 Speaking honestly, it's easy to explore Bayon between 60-90 minutes. There truly isn't very much to see and once you see one tower with faces you've pretty much seen all. #5 If you're traveling with a group, be very specific about the time and point out the exact place where you will meet. Our guide simply told us to meet at the east entrance. Unfortunately that doesn't mean much when you're in a country where you have no idea where the cardinal points lie. We couldn't find someone in our group because she got confused on exactly where the east entrance was located. Fortunately she remembered the name of the hotel but the rest of the group left without her."

On the other hand, I really enjoyed Bayon Temple -- built in the late 12th C. There are 54 towers each with 4 faces (for a total of 216), and apparently there is no definitive answer as to who is depicted in those faces. Our guide was Nu Tat. He speaks English very well, is well educated, and his commentaries are interesting and meaningful. Another of Tat's good qualities is that he doesn't follow the conventional itinerary so his clients tend to see the temples at less-visited times. Tat can be reached at nutarth@yahoo.com"

Bayon was impressive but there wasnt much to look at aside from the giant faces which I'll admit as impressive both in size and craftsmanship. The temple is rather small so I agree with all the reviews that you need to go early to get the full experience. We didn't go early and so the temple was crammed with loud / disrespectful Asian tour groups (which consume Siem Reap all year round apparently). We felt rushed in seeing the temple because the herd of tourists were scrambling to get a photo opp.If you're like is abs don't like living behind your camera lense and instead prefer slowly seeing and absorbing the temple as you're there then go early!Overall the time temple gets a 3. Angkor Wat and Ta Prom were WAY better."

Our guide, Rany, was very knowledgeable about these ruins. Bayon temple is fun to explore but you really need a good English speaking guide with a lot of knowledge to help you understand its history and significance. I took tons of pictures and my daughter and I had to try the picture trick of smiling profile in the distance, daughter's profile up close, and the resulting nose to nose picture. This was by far my favorite temple."

Bas-relief carvings show the battles between the Champa kingdom and the Khmer; there are 'frozen' Apsara dancers on every other wall. Nearby are the Elephant and Leper King terraces. It is a photographer's delight. While others in our tour group had seen enough by the third visit, I could have stayed at the Angkor complex for a week! Do wear good walking or gym shoes - the steps and uneven surfaces are a challenge at times.

I highly recommend you get a guide too because Siem Reap is huge and it's always better to be in the company of someone who knows where the important places are, and when best to go there. We were there in November 2013 where the place is at its peak, and so we really appreciated that Cheak Chuom (our guide) fixed our itinerary in a way that we were at the right places at the right time where the sun perfectly hit the magnificent towers of its temples. Here's a link to his blog where you'll find his contact details: www.angkorenglishtourguide.wordpress.com (email: chuomcheak@ymail.com) The trip was extraordinary, the services outstanding!

We also rode an elephant around the temple ($15) which gave us a great vantage point for photos. If you are wanting it, it's a good idea to book the ride, as there are often big tour groups booked.

On my first trip I paid for the elephant ride around the temple and parts of Angkor Thom, I recommend it at least once (the elephants don't seem to be abused like the ones in Thailand). This trip we saw wild monkeys mingling with the visitors. It's tempting to walk right into the middle of the temple and focus on the faces, but take the time to walk around the outer gallery. The bas-reliefs depict events of Jayavarman VII's rule, and are beautifully done."

I went there right after the sunrise at Angkor Wat and got to enjoy the place for myself for enough time (10-15min) to get good photos of the upper level in all its glory.If I were to go back, I would go even earlier (you won't see the sunrise itself from there, but aim to be there right at the moment there is some light). Head to the upper level first and when people start to gather, find a corner to have a small breakfast overlooking the grounds. Then take time to explore the lower levels.Amazing sight and should not be missed."

It will look fantastic with the soft light and you will be able to stroll around with very few people. It really adds to the atmosphere if you go early or late, like all Angkor temples.Once I was there, I spent the first hour staring at the towers high up from one of the internal buildings commonly called \"libraries\". Great shots with a long lens.It's not only about the faces: the entire perimeter is covered in carvings. Take your time to look at them from up close and discover miniatures of daily life 800 years ago."

As you approach the river runs through the jungle- the waters come from the mountains, the bridge is 10th century and on your way to the entrance you will find a small temple to the right and another to your left.The Victory Gate is fabulous- we got out of our vehicle and our guide took us up the hillside so that we could get a perfect profile of the faces on the gate. You even see bits of crumbling original ancient pottery in the grass.Within you see 54 columns which represent the 54 provinces of the Khmer Empire which spanned all the way from what is today called Thailand and all the way across to the shoreline of what is today called Vietnam- yes THAT huge- the largest in SE Asia. Only the Royal family, the high officials and their servants lived in this complex. Each of the 54 towers has four heads of the Buddha- facing the cardinal points. You can wander through the complex and view more of the heads which are astonishing. The South Gate showed reconstructed heads being put onto the ruins which I thought was a great idea and I hope that tourism helps to pay for this reconstruction. At this temple you see scenes of everyday life depicted in the sculptures- which is unusual as most of the temples show the story of the Ramayana- here you can see people eating finger food, a woman giving birth,someone drinking palm alcohol, the wars with the Chams- the moslims who tried to invade in the 12th century etc. The whole place is fascinating and a lovely reflection of how life was for some people at that time...fabulous. I agree with comments re tourists- there are always hoards- but we are all tourists and I guess we at least can be helping with the economy of Cambodia by visiting the area- despite all the crowds we had a good time- we were just one couple with our guide and he took us here for about 10.30am, we didn't see that many folk really- its just when you want to take a photo I guess and someone's head inevitably pops up or a shoulder etc...that's life !"

Hire a guide if you must for more elaborate understanding of the temples but I went temple hopping alone. Take a book for quiet time alone, bring along a trusty camera to wait for the best sunlight for pictures. Bayon, featuring stone faces of the four-face Buddha and other inscriptions, is largely different from other temples. Take care while climbing the steep steps.

The remote and outer ruins aren't in as good shape as the main temples like Bayon, but they're not crowded and allow you to actually enjoy and experience this piece of Khmer history. We looked at Bayon as we passed by it, but decided not to stop and fight the crowds after we had already had a magical experience at the ruins we found."

It does not have an enclosing wall although it is protected by the wall surrounding Angkor Thom.It is characterised by over 2000 large, smiling, serene and silent faces carved on its majestic towers. It is generally accepted that the four faces on each of the towers are images of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and that they signify the omnipresence of the king. The characteristics of these faces - a broad forehead, downcast eyes, wide nostrils, thick lips that curl upwards slightly at the ends-combine to reflect the famous 'Smile of Angkor'.The basic plan of the Bayon is a simple one comprising three levels . The first and second levels are square galleries featuring bas-reliefs. It is possible and well worth it to climb almost to the very top of the Central Sanctuary -- the third level.Despite this seemingly simple plan, the arrangement of the Bayon is complex, with a maze of galleries, passages and steps connected in a way that make the levels practically indistinguishable and creates dim lighting, narrow walkways, and low ceilings. The architectural scale and composition of the Bayon exude grandness. I was fascinated by it. This was definitely one of the highlights of my visit."

Possibly everyone else had been watching the sunrise at Angkor Wat but whatever the reason I was grateful for the serenity and space to contemplate the marvels of the amazing relic. An absolute must to see but do try to go early in the day. My top tip for temple visits is to hire a bicycle if you are physically up to it. We rented our bikes through our hotel and cycled from central Siem Reap. All up I estimate we bicycled around 40-45 easy kilometres. The whole complex is very flat and easy to navigate around and with your own transport you are not at the mercy of over helpful tuk-tuk drivers. Cycling around was such a pleasant experience I would be very happy to repeat it. Do remember to carry water although it is also available to purchase."

Rumour has it that King Jayavarman the VII, who wanted his people to follow Buddhism, made these huge faces on the pillars with his likeness to depict that he is watching over his kingdom.The Bayon was an engaging, enchanting and haunting experience. The temple literally had - expressions ! We had to climb up to the terrace to enjoy the view from up there and also to get a closer look at the enormous carvings and the shrine within. Such was the magic of this temple that we ended up staying here for more than 2 hours! We took some of the best photographs there. Needless to say as this was one of the most popular temples and tourists thronged the area. Soon, after getting a feel of the temple and absorbing the spectacular ambience all around, we decided to leave. But we were not yet done with Bayon, we knew we had to come back, sooner than later."

Every smile, they tell us, is slightly different. Did you find the happiest one? It can be crowded, so you may want to try and go either slightly later in the day, as everyone tends to try & get here first. There is no fee, as it's covered by the entrance to the Archeological Park, but there are plenty of stairs, some fairly steep, so you don't want to be doing this if you aren't reasonably comfortable with walking. It isn't hard, just there's lots of them. Many thanks to our guide, who was EXCELLENT at finding the quiet spots for good photos!"

The giant faces make for good background and there is always a long queue taking pictures. The temple itself is quite compact and so very easy to access from various directions. Besides the attention grabbing faces, there are also very interesting and intricate base reliefs. You need at least two hours to really appreciate this temple and all it's intricacies.

Access to Angkor Wat itself was restricted for religious reasons, so many of the tours decided to visit Bayon instead. Because of this congestion we had to walk from the Smiling Heads gate all the way to the temple itself and it was very very hot!! Once inside, ease of movement was restricted due to the large numbers of visitors. It was also difficult to appreciate the majesty of the architecture because of the behaviour of some tourists wanting to take funny/silly pictures. It's a place I would like to visit again, so that I can appreciate it more.

It\u2019s just amazing that people at that long time ago can reach high level of building and carving on the stone like this.

A good fitness level, and excellent shoes--don't bother with bringing flip flops to any of these venues--is important. Morning is a great time to view these haunting faces and introduce yourself to the architecture of Angkor. Bring lots of water and an umbrella for protection from the blazing sun.There are a large number of temples in the Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, and outlying areas as well. Don't feel you have to see them all. Three full days of touring are important to do this world-class venue justice but these are the Don't Miss sites, in this order of priority: Angkor Wat, of course, the stellar, Number One site; Bayon; Terrace of the Elephants and Terrace of the Leper King; Ta Prohm; Bandrey Srei; Preah Kahn; Pre Rup; Neak Prean.Give yourself time to visit your three favorites a second time within your three day itinerary. Many are so overwhelming in their interest, architecture, and artistry that you must see them at least twice to begin to appreciate them. We had to see the Churning of the River of Milk at Angkor Wat three times, as it was so artistically stunning, and is comparable to the greatest carvings anywhere in the World."

This temple had 54 towers. Up near the top of each tower on each of the four sides facing North, South, East and West are a big face. The temple was rushed and made in only 10 years (some temples took 50 years to build). Because of rush, the pieces of stone making up the structure are smaller and thus not as stable - basically it's a beautiful structure but a little rough around the edges. On one wall is the story of the king who built the temple. He was a man of the people and wanted harmony. He made his temple to support both Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. He wanted to move his entire forward and not create a civil war by creating a temple to worship and honour the gods of only one religion - smart man. There is just something so peaceful and beautiful about this temple - a must see!"

This temple is large and it has innumerable faces of Buddha and Jayavaraman VII. It is an 'open temple' (no roof), so you can see many different parts of it from any given spot. This creates a seemingly infinite number of angles to view and photograph. In addition, since it is open you see the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding jungle as you view the temple. Not to be overlooked is the imposing entrance with a walkway lined with soldiers (good and evil) surrounded on either side by water and jungle. There is also a large entrance gate that is impressive. This grandeur of this place can really not be described in words. It is best to go here early or late because it is very crowded. I think it would be better to visit Angkor Wat before going to Bayon given that Bayon is more impressive. I found Angkor Wat to be a bit of a letdown having gone to Bayon first."

Another thing is that it's so much detail into such a \"small\" area. There are carvings everywhere, in the different hallways and junctions, on the outer and inner walls, on the various levels and up at the top. We walked around at our own pace and climbed some of the small buildings in the courtyard surrounding the main temple. From there, you can take some interesting pictures, just be careful with the steep stairs as always. The hallways once you enter the temple building are quite dark and with some condensation, also quite slippery at times. We eventually found the stairs which take you to the upper level and from there, got some amazing views of the carved faces. Be aware that at the top level, there were a group of children asking for money - one of them asked for candy - it's obviously your choice to give or not; we had no candy..."

However the guy who pulled this on me ended up taking some pretty nice shots of me for the equivalent of 4 quid and since I was on my own I would have had no one to take them for me. This, rather than Angkor Wat is the postcard picture temple for Siem Reap and is only one in the huge complex of Angkor Thom. I loved clambering down the steep health and safety-free steps and through the long dark tunnel but it's a real shame anyone with mobility problems has to stare from a distance.

Taking a closer look to the rocks, you will definitely see carvings of the past and if you place your hands on the rocks, you will find it cold even the sun is shining brightly above your head. It is a wonderful visit to the place and we are still amaze how people in the past are able to build this place."

Amazingly it was built after Angkor Wat but seems somehow less sophisticated. The guide books reveal that consequent rulers kept remodelling Bayon rather than build a new temple complex elsewhere and the scale of Angkor Thom (inside which is located Bayon) suggests that a very major city must have been located there at that time.Bayon is, of course, famous for the diversity and multitude of faces carved into the walls and towers of this temple."

The giant stone faces of Bayon have become one of the most recognizable images connected to classic Khmer art and architecture. There are 37 standing towers,most but not all sporting four carved faces oriented towards the cardinal points. Who the faces represent is a matter of debate.... The best of Bayon are the base-relief on the exterior walls where the stone faces reside. The realism of the southern wall base-relief is uncanny....a sea battle between Khmer and the cham. Even more interesting are extensive carvings depicting everyday life that are interspersed among the battle scenes,including market scenes,cockfighting,chess games and child birth. The surrounding tall jungle makes Bayon a bit dark and flat for the photographic purists who gather here every sunrise and sunset. Spectacular"

A personal tour guide is recommended while going around as they know more stories, history and whereabouts. The temple does not only show these huge stone faces but as well as interesting wall gallery showing a bit of Khmer history. Outside the temple one can also enjoy an elephant ride, around $15 usd pp to go around the temple (which we skipped btw).

The splendor of the place really overshadows nearly everything else there, which is a shame. Bayon Temple is much smaller, but no less spectacular and no less historically significant.Our group spent a good 2 hours at the site, where we were given in-depth knowledge of its history by a very professional Cambodian guide. The temple is a photographer's dream come true. Shots from every angle came out amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the sculptures and the wall bas-relief. Being a Thai, it was enlightening to learn of the ancient connection between the Siamese and Khmer civilizations that Thai history books neglected or forgot to tell you.One of the most pleasant things about visiting Bayon is the absence of massive crowds you find at Angkor Wat. There are still a number of visitors there, but you can still do your own search for hidden corners and photo ops in relative peace. There will, of course, be the occasional noisy groups, but overall Bayon Temple offers a true learning experience. It is definitely a must visit in Siem Reap."

We have all seen these faces all too often in books, magazines, documentaries and travel paraphernalia but to be here among these most astonishing smiling faces carved out of massive pieces of stone is one great hard-to-explain feeling.Prasat Bayon or The Bayon Temple was built by King Jayavarman VII of the Khmer Empire and sits in the very centre of Angkor Thom, which was the capital city of the Khmer Empire and fortified by a 3.0 km by 3.0 km wall all around. It is said that the distance from any of the five tower gates to the Bayon temple measures 1.5km. It is even said that the walls of the Bayon temple were constructed to run north-south and also east-west and that the four faces that adorn every single tower structure had also been amazingly designed to face the four cardinal points (the four main points of the compass).There are countless towers with the serene faces, some people even calling them smiling faces and it\u2019s really hard to imagine the arduous tasks and unparalleled skills of the artisans of that era who have actually immortalized these stone sculptures, which were not carved out of one single piece of rock but a combination of a number of big rocks put together to create each face. They are said to depict the face of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara but there are some who say that among these faces are some which depicts King Jayavarman VII\u2019s face as well. Apart from the faces, there were so many bas-reliefs on the walls of the lower and also the upper levels of the temple depicting everyday folk lore, battle scenes and even the Apsara dances, and these carvings on the walls are still so sharp and crisp, considering the age of the building. The craftsmanship is really intriguing.Everywhere you turn you see these huge smiling faces and this exudes a calming effect on most people visiting the Bayon, which is one of my two favourite temples in the Angkor Archaeological Park area, the other being Ta Prohm Temple. Bayon is a fascinating temple and is a must-visit site in Cambodia."

Book a highly motivated and knowledgeable Tuk Tuk driver,this will make all the difference in enjoying the temples, the night markets and Pub Street. There is nothing like having your personal Tuk Tuk driver for your entire stay in Siam Reap. He will recommend what time to start sightseeing at the many temples, which temples to see and at what time to avoid the many tour buses and hoards of tourists. He will also recommend the time your will need at each temple and where he will pick up up. I really hate seeing such wonderful sights when they are so packed with tourists. Nothing like seeing the temples at your own pace. Your Tuk Tuk driver can take you to any of the restaurants in your guide books and give you a personal tour around Siam Reap to see some of the modern Buddha Temples and night markets. Our driver was great! He had cold bottles of water ready for us when we needed it in the hot day and cool moist clothes; scented with lemon grass. He dropped off our dirty laundry to a place he recommended and picked it up for us latter that day so we would not have to pay those high hotels rates for doing laundry.Our Tuk Tuk Drivers Name was Mr. Mao Da. He English was good and he was very professional and easy going. His E- Mail Address is maoda@live.com. He has a facebook page at Da Angkor wat driver and you can look at his website at: www.experienceanglor.com. His Phone number is: 097 96 440 66 & 855 97 96 440 66. I would recommend you try to book him by sending him am E- mail so he can meet you either at the airport if you give him all your information or if your hotel already has free transfer service from the Airport to the hotel; have him meet you outside your hotel at a specific time; leaving him you name and number of people in your party. The Tuk Tuk will hold 4 normal people comfortably.Since he was a great Driver; when he dropped us off at our restaurant for dinner I would give him $5 so he could have dinner with his friends. You pay him each day for his services and if you value his service; you give him one extra day pay as a thank you on the last day of service."

There are thousands of smiling faces that are contagious, you end up smiling too!

My husband and I both thought this was the best temple to walk through and explore. The mystic of this temple as the roots of the trees wound around some of the areas created this feeling of having been sent back in time in a time capsule. The beautiful carvings in the stone, the detail, the ability to have created something so magnificent so many years ago is just mind boggling. I could have spent a lot more time here, but knowing that we wanted to see the other temples and having just gone to Angkor Wat, we only allowed ourselves the luxury of closely examining the artwork on just a couple of the entrances to the rooms. This Temple deserves ample time to explore, so if planning a trip here allow at least three or four hours. If you don't have that much time, then please stop and admire the beautiful detail of a couple of the areas. To walk through this maze of temple room and paths without taking the time to closely look at some of the detailed work would be such a waste."

There are three levels to look around and it is beautiful with all the ornate stone carvings especially the heads on the spires. It is included in the ticket price and also is 2nd on the small circuit trip.One thing to take note on is that there are rouge guides who roam the temple and start guiding you round and then ask for a tip.

Once you leave the complex on the far side and turn around, you will never forget the view of this hauntingly beautiful temple. The Bayon was built by King Jayavarman VII (some say the smiling faces resemble his face) about 900 years ago and was originally a Hindu temple but was later converted to a Buddhist temple.

We went in after 5:30pm, which you don\u2019t have to pay but in two days we could see Angkor Wat and Bayon. If you really want to experience this area you need all day or more day than that. You should bring your picnic equipments to sit next to canal and enjoy nature."

Along the compound, there are some tall tower which is pretty scary to scale and to come down from. From Bayon temple, you can follow along the trail to some other smaller lesser known temple and the elephant terrace. The tuktuk that you hire will be waiting there and it will take approximately 2 hrs to leisurely finish this entire trail."

So many parts of the temple to explore at your own free will - a fabulous morning out. There are monkeys just before you reach the temple so if you wish come prepared with banana's (0.75c for a bunch from market stall) too feed the monkeys. They are very tame and take them out of your hand. My four year old loved it. There is also a elephant ride around the temple for $15 each. My Daughter was free and she enjoyed it. I would only recommend this if you are desperate for a ride or have kids hassling you for one! Elephants seemed well treated but I found it expensive and also not the most comfortable of rides!!"

Said to be based on Hindu numerology, each tower has 4 faces facing the cardinal directions North, South, East, and West. Faces that are said to be either of King Jayavarman the 7th (their most compassionate king), the Lord Gautama Buddha (the enlightened one), or Avalokiteshvara (a great spirit). I say, they are all beautiful. Each one having a positively mysterious Mona Lisa smile. I easily connected with the presence of the place and felt so at home, at peace.

When you step out of your tuk tuk or van you are in shock of how cool the faces are in stone. I loved the Bayon Temple and would go see it again in a heart beat. A Must See."

The structure would be great representation of peace, power, tolerance and wisdom.During 500BC to 1500AD many emperors promote Buddhism and their non-violence philosophy. Emperor Ashok would another example. Most of us may have seen example when we or our parents born as per one religious and married or influence by other religious. For them Brahmanism/Hinduism and Buddhism tied very closely.One things which seems to me little odd during our visit we have seen many statue of Brahma, the creator (member of Trimurti or trinity). But many places the descriptions were not in sync or saying same thing.Not sure if in different language they call it different.There are still lot to find about this temple, place and history.I am already asking all my friends to visit and have this spiritual experience."

It is relatively smaller (than Angkor Wat), but it is magnificent. Definitely worth the visit. The architecture is a bit confusing. You will see pathways leading to nothing but a wall. And many walls put together - making no structure. It will fascinate you when you try to figure what is going on.There is a huge Budha temple right in front of it. Must visit.

It is said that there are 216 stone faces carved in this temple, which means it has 54 towers.The carvings are magnificent on such scale, that each faces resembles each other but some has it's unique such as the widest smile etc and sometimes if we see it from a viewpoint we can see as if the statues are having a conversation with each other. It is said that Bayon was built in a hurry due to the war at the time, since it is using smaller stones so that the condition right now is not as good as Angkor Wat and some of the carving are not finished."

Then the monsoon rains came and only the brave and devoted remained. Just a dozen visitors exploring the site in the warm, afternoon rain.I wandered about, staring into the knowing eyes of the staring stone faces and wondered how many times the rains had washed their faces and how many people they had watched pass by over the last thousand years or so.One of the greatest experiences of my life.

I can not work the Bayon out, it is so much different from the other temples. it does not matter how many times i go round this temple, its got me baffled. it has more of a palace feel to it, were as the other temples are more for worship and celebration, maybe ime looking at it wrong, but I can spend hours deep in thought trying to figure it out. its a good job I have a understanding tuk tuk driver."

It was a gate in the centre with the churning of the ocean depicted on either side by huge stone monuments of asuras and devas on either side. The Bayon temple was built around 1190 AD as the official state temple of Buddhist King Jayavarman VII, and, also known as a temple of beaming faces, it is in the centre of the ancient city of Angkor Thom (means great city). The Bayon Temple is a three-tiered pyramid consisting of 51 towers each, with a head facing each of the four directions. In all there are more than 11,000 carved figures over 1.2 kms of wall.Head on north from the Bayon and we reached the temple of Baphuon. No shorts or sleeveless allowed here. Continuing on north is the Terrace of the Elephants, a 300m-long terrace used originally as a royal reception pavilion, with its name derived from the carvings of elephants on the wall. Next to the Terrace of the Elephants is the Terrace of the Leper King. Walk along the 7m high wall with bands of bas-reliefs and intricate carvings. It is called Leper King because the stone was being eroded in parts of the ruins, giving it the leper effect. The entire area is stunning - the architecture of the carvings, the intricacy, the fact that it has lasted this long..make sure you take a hat or an umbrella though, or else you'd easily pass out from the heat!"

We prefer to visit Angkor Wat the first afternoon for sunset, this gives you plenty of time to see it before the next morning...you can then see the sun rise if its clear and then move along to Bayon Quickly."

Bayon is famous for the large faces carved in the stone (according to our guide it's still disputed whether the faces are those of the Buddha or the king), and it didn't disappoint. There are multiple levels in the temple, allowing you to get up close and personal with the faces for some great photos. There's a shrine in the centre tower with a very spiritual feeling and a couple of locals tending the shrine (they'll show you how to make a prayer and give you a string bracelet for a small offering). Combine with Ta Prohm and Angkor Wat for almost the best day tour you'll ever experience."

No matter how many photos you have seen of the Faces, you are not prepared for the real thing. The size is enormous and adds to the grandeur of the entire site. Bayon was the highlight of our trip to Siem Reap. We came for Angkor Wat, but left with a camera full of photos of Bayon. Climbing and walking among the temple walls itself was awe-inspiring. Do go in the morning when the light hits the temple just right and the detail of the carvings is most distinct. Also, I recommend it for sunrise - much better than Angkor Wat - the sun coming up and hitting the temple faces is amazing and really lights up the beautiful color of the stone. We spent hours just touring inside the walls of Angkor Thom and most of that time was spent in Bayon. But don't miss the other temples and the terraces, it is all very worthwhile."

I suggest you go here after seeing Angkor Wat since the distance is not that far. Hiring a private car is a smart option as the weather is very hot and the road is dusty if you'd prefer to bike or take a tuktuk. Once inside, you will see different faces carved into stones. Too bad a lot of portion was under renovation when we went there last April 23, otherwise it would've been perfect! I prefer Bayon temple over Angkor Wat, just an honest opinion."

Like almost all of the temples in the area, completely overrun by enormous Chinese tour groups. Apparently it's common practice to combine a number of individual groups (keeps the cost down), thus only one guide needs to be hired. This arrangement, unfortunately, also requires the use of a loudhailer. It's a real pain in the backside to wait for the opportunity to photograph something - whilst 50 people take it in turn to pose in front of exactly the same thing. They also have yet to learn the concept of putting their litter in a bin! Angkor Thom was the only complex where we were persued by groups of children flogging 10 postcards for $1. Their English was, actualy, better than theiy initially let on...One persistent young lady, having listened to me say \"no thank you\" over and over again to the postcards then pulled a selection of trinkets (all $1) from her bag. Once again, I said \"no \", to which she replied \"how about yes\". Couldn't fault her for trying!"

It is an extremely decorative temple containing over 200 stone carvings of a variety of massively large faces that reportedly bear a strong resemblance to the King that ordered the temple to be built - King Jayavarman V11. The faces are fascinating to look at and no two seem alike! We found the temple itself to be small in size but jam packed with things to look at. 1 hour is enough to dedicate to this temple. The parking area is well shaded so take the opportunity as you just don't know when your next shady tree will be!

There is a lot of renovation currently underway but there's still plenty to see. The temple is on many levels and be sure to visit the chamber at the very top and have a rest with the Buddha within. The best time to visit is at dawn or a bit later when the sun climbs over the surrounding trees and casts a beautiful, warm light on the stones. Once the tour buses arrive the calm and mysterious ruins become a madhouse. I've visited Bayon (and all of Angkor) several times and never tire of it or cease to be amazed and astounded.

As it goes, the faces are those of Jayavarman who reclaimed the land from the Chams (Vietnamese/Champas). Breathtaking views of what man accomplished centuries ago! Walking around the place looking at all the giant faces staring at you is an experience in itself. You see the harmony where one section is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and another to Lord Shiva, not withstanding the Shiva Lingam in the Northern section.Its a different world and its simply amazing! I would definitely go back again!"

Most towers have 4 faces ( i on each side) but sometimes there areco only 3 or even 2. This temple is extremely complex both in terms of its structure and meaning having passed thtrough different religious phases and its lovely to amble through its two galleried enclosures seeing glimpses of the enigmatic faces is a facinating experience .

The world of the ancient Khmers just comes to life that way, and lets not forget also all the columns of faces, spectacular.

More than one hundred in total, I have read. This is not a huge structure and it has various levels that can be accessed. It certainly looks different from Angkor Wat and should be on the must-do list of all visitors to the area.Again, this is a marvel of design and construction.

But what made our two-day stay in Siem Reap so great was our guide -- Chandara Niev (nickname, Ing) -- chandarakh@yahoo.com. He was everything you'd expect in a good guide -- prompt, knowledgable, enthusiastic, really good English. But so much more. When we wanted to know about rice production, he pulled off the road, walked into a paddy field and introduced himself and us to a family who taught us how to harvest rice (very entertaining and informative for all!); he was happy to recommend a good restaurant for lunch, but also cajoled us into trying fried, crickets and frogs and sticky rice and raisins steamed in bamboo; when we toured Tonle Sap Lake he took us to a family who invited us onto their floating home. He was sophisticated (exchanging Facebook info and sharing flash drives and good photography tips), but also grew up in a village and knew what it meant to study without electricity. He was politically savvy and serious sharing his family's experience with the Khmer Rouge, but also had a great sense of humor and didn't seem to mind waiting around while we shopped for the perfect Cambodian scarf. He was great company. Highly, highly recommended."

The price is quite steep at $15USD per person, though worth it for such an incredible experience! The mahout frequently stopped close to the temple in order for us to take quality photographs.

My 10yr old daughter and I on this occasion hired a local tuktuk and driver for the one day ticket, which included the sunset tour and 'killing fields' the evening before, plus a full second day starting at about 4am for sunrise, for \u00a312 (though, obviously we tipped him at the end and bought his food and drink during the tour as well). Because we were able to dictate the speed of the tour, we had the luxury of waiting until the crowds dissipated and managed to get the temple to ourselves at times. I have amazing photos, which do not contain a single person, and also give the impression that we had it to ourselves the entire time! My daughter enjoyed playing 'where's wally' with the various Buddha heads carved into the structure. I preferred this temple to Angkor Wat, which was being restored at the time of travel.

I can just imagine the effort and creativity of ancient Khmers to be able to fashion smiling faces out of the rocks. Luckily, there was a tour guide who led me to some photo effects, like slightly tilting my head up- in one spot so that it would appear that am nose-to-nose with the huge statue of the king. In the end, after touring me through the nooks and crannies of Bayon - even though he was unsolicited, the guide asked for a tip and I happily gave some. Go to the top of this temple, it's very much worth it. There will be very good angles you will not be able to appreciate otherwise. Some of the steps going up can be very steep so be prepared."

Favorite was the Elephant statues at the tail end of the temple circuit. Dislikes: Crowds, tour buses and motorbikes definitely took away any peaceful vibes one could experience from this exotic sanctuary. How can they regulate the number of people to visit to make it more manageable? Sad to see a lack of staff to ensure that impolite tourists are reprimanded for doing things like littering their water bottles everywhere (there was a mountain of water bottles at the top of one temple!) or climbing over statues and ruins where they shouldn't be doing so. Suggestion: go very very early to avoid the crowds which by 10-11am was almost intolerable."

This place needs no introduction since there are numerous TA reviews and pictures of giant faces (still do not know whether those faces represented the famous king Jayavarman VII or Buddha. Excellent photo opportunities and may be a bit less crowded compared to famous Angkor Wat (since they are pretty close, you could modify your daily trip a bit and stop by first here if it is too overcrowded, especially at Angkor Wat).Bayon Temple is located inside big Angkor Thom city wall and as for a first time visitor, you should stop by at the entrance \"naga\" bridge: with smily Bayon like faces on the left side and angry looking demons/guards on the right side.Notes: 1) Excellent literature can be found on wikipedia if you are not a book person. 2) Entrance fee is required and consider 2-3 days temple pass (40 $), a minimum to explore all those temples. 3) I do not know why people are picking on small children and poor vendors selling food and stuff in all temples. If they have too much spare time to decide what is going wrong in Cambodia or any other part of the world (as if they do not have to manage their own affairs), why don't they go ahead and explore who got your temple pass money-- All entrance fees from tourists go to a private company (read as cronies making money with corrupted government) and do you know how much money Cambodia government/ordinary people eventually receive to improve their daily lives of their citizens and how little money go to temple renovation? Anyway, selling food or souvenir is not a crime and some children do go to school (they have either morning or afternoon classes to choose). Do not think that the world is uniform and flat and every school in the world is whole day. If they do not make any money and have nothing to eat, they will starve to death before thinking whether they should go to school or not. By buying food or stuff from them, your precious money (as wealthy tourists from developed countries think) go directly to ordinary Cambodian people and they could eventually buy rice to eat. I think it is more unethical if you haggle down a lot to those poor vendors because you think you are superior and you can do whatever you want (of course some vendors inflate the price a lot)!"

I also returned in the late afternoon, and there was a dramatic change in the color of the stones with the late afternoon light. Bayon was built by Jayavarnam VII during the end of the 12th century and was his state temple. Guide books differ on whose face is said to be carved into the towers. The bas-reliefs on the lower walls are fascinating, and should be viewed with a knowledgable guide.

First, you have the bridge over the moat, which is a series of ancient lovely Khmer carved figures lined up like so many Rockettes.Then, you have the entrance gate, which is lovely, but grab your camera as you may soon see an elephant stroll through, tourists perched precariously atop in a little sedan chair.Lastly, the temple itself. When it was built, each city-state was asked to contribute a statue to one of the 59 temples in the complex. Each temple has faces on four sides, a bit Maori-like. The phrase \"cut your nose off to spit your face\" supposedly comes to the defacing of such temples by conquerors throughout history.You could spend hours here looking at all the faces. Lovely setting too."

The faces are fantastic and have to be seen to be appreciated. The place has a magical atmosphere and although it is far smaller than the building area of Angkor Wat I would have to say I preferred this. There are lots of tourists and at times this can be a pain. However, you might be able to get a quieter area where you can enjoy the various perspectives of the many faces and just spend time in awe of the beauty of this place. We also took the chance to have a n elephant ride around the Bayon. Again we really enjoyed this although it is not the most comfortable transport you will experience. I am so glad that we visited and spent time at the Bayon and the faces of stone will be in my memory for a long time to come."

There were hordes of tourists running all over the place who seemed to care for nothing except to click away their pictures to glory coming primarily from a country that starts with a capital C. These irresponsible tourists were trampling all over the structures, climbing up and down the precarious stones, and generally making a nuisance of themselves. I doubt if even one of them appreciated the beauty and grandeur that could still be seen in the highly damaged sculptures.I also blame the authorities for not shutting down this historical and cultural treasure until it is fully restored, and even then restricting the movement of these crazy tourists. It desperately calls for better management. Based on what I saw here and at Banteay Srei and some of the other temples, these structures are unlikely to survive this onslaught for very long. Angkor Wat itself is in better shape and is far better managed and controlled. The mad and crazy tourists do not trample overit the way they do elsewhere. Please stop them before thes ebeautiful tempples are lost forever."

It is still very interesting and the faces are plentiful and well maintained, but for some reason I thought it would be bigger, almost like Angkor Wat. It is still substantial, though, and worth seeing."

This was one of the 3 major sites we visited in the vicinity of Siem Reap, and it offered a dramatic return to the glorious 12th Century of Khmer architecture, as well as an object lesson in how little this great heritage has been respected by succeeding generations. Its proportions are massive and the workmanship lavished upon it is remarkable. The grey stone-work gives it a gothic texture, out of which are carved a range of images, the most celebrated being a series of 4 grotesque faces wearing different demeanours. The walls of the inner and outer sanctuaries are decorated with bas relief carvings relating tales of Khmer mythology or of true historical events, and the craftsmanship comes close to that of Angkor Wat itself. Although this impressive temple is not in good repair, and one has to tread carefully over piles of fallen rock, the fact that huge cranes hover over parts that are out of bounds signifies that someone is making a huge effort to restore this site to its original glory. I would love to return when the workmen have completed their job."

Pretty soon all of them start to look the same; you feel jaded, blurr..start forgetting the names.....But not Bayon.Bayon, in my opinion, is among the top 3: together with Angkow Wat and Ta Prohm, in terms of \"awe power\" and depth etched in the mind. It is one of those things you'll remember forever. It is part of the Angkor Thom city, now an archaeological park. (Entrance fees covers all the temples inside.) Main entrance to the the city itself is grand, with an elaborate, tall arc and main gate, preceeded by row of stone guards lining the bridge towards the entrance. ). As you approach the Bayon temple, the jumble of towers resolve and start showing faces. Yes, the faces seen in all the pics of Cambodia. Haunting,impressive, sad, smiling, glorious, crumbling, awe-spiring, humbling, spell-binding,....you run out of adjectives to describe it. A masterpiece of ancient human spirit. [I wonder why and and what cost those kings built such edifices. Surely one reason why the country ended up being so poor?]Take your time; walk around, up and down, in and out, all nooks and corners, the compound and the roof. Staircases are steep and narrow, and stone blocks lying around in places.Careful with children around. It will be very hot in midday withour tree cover around, since the compound is covered by cobblestones.Bring a lot of water and hats. Most important, bring along a good camera...you'll be shooting pics of your lifetime."

I visited this temple around noontime and I was pleasantly surprised that the temple wasn't filled with tourists so much so that I got many great shots of Bayon's well known face towers without much effort trying to find a spot without one or many tourists blocking the shot. And, if you want a great vantage point of Bayon, you just need to go to the other side of the moat surrounding Bayon and take a shot from there. Many tend to forget the other parts of the temple, like the maze of hallways at the lower level of the inner gallery and the bas reliefs at its outer gallery. Since I had about an hour or so to go explore Bayon, I ventured to the lower level of the inner gallery and found the temperature there to be way lower and it was welcomed coolness from the horrible heat in the upper level. Going through this maze, don't forget to look up when you see a collapsed ceiling. You may see a face tower or two peeking. But, if you only have a little over 30 minutes to spare in Bayon, go to the upper level of the inner gallery and have your fill of the face towers and take photos with them. Regardless of the time you have, Bayon is a temple NOT TO BE MISSED."

It was a pleasant tuk tuk ride (Angkor Tuk Tuk) at that hour of the day. We passed several other temples along the way but did not stop. Bayon greets you on its western face. As you drive on past to the main northern entrance, you begin to feel insignificant looking at all the serene faces. They seem to have found peace. There is so much to see here that you need to be prepared to spend a good portion of a morning or afternoon here. Although there were a few busloads of tourists we found that we could wander around by ourselves without too much interference from the crowds. There were a few photo opportunity sites where it got very crowded, particularly with photographers taking endless photographs of large group tours. They seem to think the place belongs to them and do not like you trying to take a photograph. They will try to block you.There are some 216 faces - some of them better preserved than others. The corridors can be narrow and dark, so walk carefully and be mindful that in some cases you have to take large steps to go from \"room\" to room to cross over the doorways. If you are tall you will have to mind your head at all times. At the lower level there are some mossy corridors that can make for a good photograph at the right angle. Some of the faces have a third eye carved into them as an anti-Bhuddist campaign after the death of the King Jayavarman VII. Dont forget that there are lots of stairs getting up to each level.There are lots of interesting carvings all around the outer walls. We found one where there was a Sadhu (Hindu holy man) trying to climb a tree to escape a tiger - this is on the south side.One of the heads on the main upper terrace offers a trick photo opportunity. You can stand at a particular spot and looking towards a head a photograph can be taken that looks like you are rubbing noses with the head. There are also good opportunities through the windows. Professional photographers station themselves at these opportunities and you will have difficulty trying to get your own photograph at these places.If you walk around the outer wall you will find it peaceful. There is a moat running all around it and you can, if you do not want to or cannot walk through and up the monument itself, take an elephant ride around the moat. This will give you another perspective of the monument and you will also get reflections in the moat water. There is also a very large gilded Buddha in a shrine to the west. This is also a good place to prop yourself if you are walking around the monument, as it is generally quiet and shady and the vendors do not venture here and will not bother you.If you want more than just a casual look around the monument, then you will need a guide to explain the scenes. The east gallery depicts the Khmer army marching to war.There is a central tower where there is a statue of a Buddha. It said that the original was destroyed and then discovered in a well. When they put it back together, it would not fit through the door, so it must have been in place before the walls around it were built. The Buddha statue that you now see is much smaller. We would have liked to spent more time looking at the carvings around the galleries but it was getting very hot. There are photographers stationed at the south entrance and a few vendors too.Walk around the moat and see some beautiful reflections. There are a few ducks on the moat and they too become part of the photo opportunity.The vendors are kept away from inside the site and this is a good thing. You can buy whole coconuts and this is a must experience. When you have finished drinking the water they will cut the coconut open for you and you can also eat the soft flesh inside.This is definately a temple where you should spend a fair amount of time."

We visited around lunchtime and found the temple less crowded, as most of the tour-groups break for lunch around this time. As we were leaving, the crowds started pouring in. Also stunning at sunset, we went past this temple another evening and it was beautiful at this time of day."

I thought, \"He seems like a character\", and went over to him and enquired about the photo. He laughed, held his hand out for my camera, and indicated for me to follow him. He proceeded to bring me around the Bayon, showing me some really amazing secrets hidden inside (I won't give them away here!), as well as giving insights into the carvings and the cosmology of Hinduism and Buddhism, which I am quite familiar with already, but it was nice to hear it anyway. He also told bits and pieces of his own story, and I could tell he was leaving a lot out... he was born in the 1960s, so I don't need to point out what he lived though...I can't remember the guy's name, but if you want some really interesting info about the construction, as well as some philosophical insights, as well as great entertainment and real friendliness, and you don't mind throwing a few extra dollars his way, definitely let this guy show you around.

IMO, Bayon Temple has more charm and character than Angkor Wat. (Sorry, I wasn't bashing it.) Grade A.Pros: Close enough to AW and, because it is bigger, feels less crowded. There's this certain corner of the temple where you can see the Kissing Buddha. (No, not literally...) But if you sit at a certain spot to have your profile meet the Buddha's profile, the resulting optical illusion makes it look like the two of you are kissing in a photograph.Cons: A lot of \"helpful\" locals on-site who will \"volunteer\" to take your picture with the Kissing Buddha but then are expecting to be paid for this favor. And, of course, the crowded lineup to take pictures with the iconic profile.Verdict: A must see... Highly recommended. Be sure to purchase the multi-day entry pass. The Angkor Temple Complex is just too big to do in one day."

The architecture and detail is like something you will never see in this day and age. An absolute must visit. You only need 30 mins to walk around it and then move on to the next one. Go early in the morning to avoid the contest ion and the midday sun. It gets very hot walking around the complex.

The fearsome beauty of this unbelievable temple really captured my heart.If you are a keen photographer it is advised to visit this temple in the morning so that you get full details of the temple in your photographs.The west side of the temple gives you some nice view for photographs. You will need a good camera with pretty high zoom to capture the details especially the \"smile of Angor\". My camera with 42X zoom was found to be very useful here,"

If the Louvre has the Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile, the Bayon Temple located in the centre of Angkor Thom, has 200 giant stone faces with equally enigmatic smiles. According to my tour guide, each of the 40+ towers has 4 faces that look out to the four directions on a compass. The faces are massive and the sheer size and number, make this place impressive. It will take your breath away. Take the time to wander around the temple to appreciate the beautiful and ornate carvings of Apsaras (celestial dancers) on the walls and arches. This is clearly up there on my list of favorite temples. If you are only in Siem Reap for a day, don't miss Bayon."

Perhaps the most distinctive amongst the many temples in Siem Reap, Bayon has huge faces carved on the temple walls, which are supposed to be either of the Buddha or the king. The faces do seem to have slightly differing nuances but they are mostly large and imposing. But don't just focus on the macros, because there are beautiful small bas reliefs on the lower walls as well. Do get your guide to advise you on the best angles to take photos since the number of faces gives you great opportunities to snap some really catchy pictures. Finally, do stop by the southern gate of the Angkor Thom complex, where Bayon is housed. The gate and the moat causeway lined with figureheads are quite spectacular and scenic as well."

            "review": "You can do it from north to south. What i realised today is that tourist buses bring people to south gate and take them from the north gate. So at the south gate, there is always a chaos. (Elephant riders; little girls selling water and trinkets etc..) But since I started from the north gate according to driver's advice, i had a pretty decent visit. At the exit i spend some time taking the pictures of elephants but i didn't have to deal with the rest of the crowd. Another tip: It was raining today so if you have a raincoat -which they sell for 1 usd everywhere when it is not raining- and rain doesn't bother you, you may visit all the places without getting disturbed by tourist groups. And trust me when these temples are crowded, it is difficult to take a decent picture. 3 temples (what they call here small tour) can be properly visited in half day, you don't need to buy a full day tour/rent a car or tuk tuk for full day. (depending how long you plan to stay in each one of course.). But if you rent a car for full day expect them to take you to one of the touristy places for lunch. If you are not going to tip the driver -you don't have to- you may as well eat at that place. you pay 2-3 dollars more but they get at least 1-1,5 usd from that. Companies pay really little to the drivers or guides. Or you can ask him to take you to one of the places where locals eat. Or to a street vendor where you can buy food for 1-1,5 dollars. (Restaurants around Angkor cost at least 7 usd per person.)"

I was told later on it was the face of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. For me,the place became a \"fun\" location for taking photos because you didn't have to encourage your subjects to smile...the statues did that for you! One place in particular became a popular picture spot because if you had a photograph taken of you at a certain angle, it looked like you were rubbing noses with one of the tower heads. Among the many temple ruins at Angkor that one must visit, Bayon Temple is a \"must see.\" I would even say, that you've not seen Angkor if you've never seen Bayon."

After having gotten up at 4:30 am to reach Angkor Wat for sunrise, and wandering around its vastness, we had a somewhat mediocre breakfast in one of the many temple restaurants, and then rolled onward to Angkor Thom through a huge parkland area of grass and trees. Angkor Thom (Big Angkor 12th \u2013 13th c ce Buddhist) is a three kilometer square walled and moated royal city and was the last capital of the Angkorian empire. King Jayavarman VII constructed his state-temple, Bayon, at the center of the city.Bayon (late 12th c ce Buddhist), a temple with thirty-seven standing towers, most but not all sporting four carved faces oriented toward the cardinal points. Apparently who the faces represent is a matter of debate but they may be Loksvara, Mahayana Buddhism\u2019s compassionate Bodhisattva, or perhaps a combination of Buddha and Jayavarman VII. The bas-reliefs on the southern wall contain real-life scenes from the historical sea battle between the Khmer and the Cham, as well as scenes from everyday life. Bayon is a smallish temple and beautiful (although quite crowded).

If you can, try to avoid the big groups of tourists so that you can take nicer pictures of yourself and the place without extra people being included in your shots.

The Temple was built by king Jayavarman the VIIth. around 11th Century. It is also popularly known as the Temple of Mona Lisa of Southeast Asia. The Khmer architure with smiling faces on the temple towers are a magnificient depiction of Eastern religions.

Then on the top level that is where the magic happens. 54 towers each with 4 smiling faces formed the canopy of the temple. Signifying 54 provinces of the Khmer Empire.

The rows and rows of magnificent towers of faces carved into the four cardinal points are mind-blowingly awesome. Happy photo-taking, as it'll be very hard to take a wrong photo in this complex. (However, be warned that you will come across flocks of gauche tourists taking kissy-faces pictures with the monuments). We took in the monuments without a tour guide, but we did have a guide book in hand and we unravelled the stories and history behind the temple as we walked through it. It was a pretty amazing experience. I suggest touring this temple (and the rest of Angkor Thom) as early in the day as possible, as it can get very hot and muggy from the middle of the day til sunset.-----------------NOTE: You will need to buy entry passes to visit ALL the temples in Siem Reap. These can be purchased from a central point (near Angkor Wat) and will be personal to holder (they'll take your picture for the pass and all passes are non-transferable.) Passes cost USD20/day, $40/3days or $60/7days. Pretty steep, but well worth the money."

Bayon deserves at least as much time as Angkor Wat. The complexity of the architecture is simply unbelievable. In addition to a guide, I would suggest bringing a flashlight as hundreds of years of revisions have created some fairly dark areas in this maze-like structure. Many faces aside, there are just so many little gems tucked waiting for you to discover. Angkor Archaeological Park doesn't get much better than this."

Do yourself a favour and don't try to do it all at once, we spread it in morning and later aafternoon visits but it would probably be better over two days, the heat is a killer. The Vietnamese operator of the complex has got it all sewn up and charges like the proverbial bull, but really doesn't put much back into it.

At first sight, it's shape is difficult to grasp, it is a very complex structure.Apart from the location and the historical meaning, two features make this temple absolutely extraordinary. First, the immense series of reliefs with rich and amazing detail (warfare with the Chams, daily life, ...) require a patient and diligent visit; second, the upper level with the towers where over 200 smiling faces look in the four cardinal directions. Strolling through these mysterious sculptures on the central plateau under a brilliant sun is an unforgettable experience. Take your time!Even in the 'cold', dry season, the place is quite hot in the middle of the day, there's almost no breeze. If possible, visit the temple in the early morning or late afternoon. That may, alas, also be the moments where massive groups of tourists invade the monument."

After spending the early morning seeing Angkor Wat, one may find it hard to imagine the even greater splendour awaiting you at the Bayon Temple.Firstly the drive / walk: you pass a river / stream with delicately carved stone elephants silently drinking only to be met by the real deal on arrival. I saw several tourists taking the unique opportunity to explore Bayon on elephant back and they really seemed to be enjoying the experience. We had a whistle-stop tour here so couldn't really take the time to indulge but even so took the opportunity to feed one resting in the shade and grab a few cheeky snaps for the family at home.Next the temple itself: wow!Its staggering to imagine that without the technology we have today, people performed the back breaking task of constructing such beauty.

It is a bit of a climb to the top, but worth the effort. You walk through galleries of carved scenes of life at court in the 12th and 13th centuries and wars against various enemies. There are over 200 carved faces in the temple. It apparently began as a Buddhist temple. It was later turned into a Hindu temple before returning to being Buddhist. Each side of the base of Bayon is a bit over 600 feet across...twice the length of a football field. I hope to return here and spend more time just wandering through it. I did not realize the complexity of the temple and, because of time limitations, could not spend as much time as I would have liked. The book \"Ancient Angkor' recommends a visit of 2 hours. 3 hours would be better because you could just sit and take it in at leisure. Unfortunately, I was there only about an hour. If I make it back to Siem Reap, I would do my sightseeing at a slower pace. I was here in early November 2011 and it was a bit hot. Take water with you as you go through the temples at this time of year. A friend was here in February 2012 and said the temperatures were in the 70s and quite comfortable."

There is something really awe inspiring about the gigantic smiling faces of Bayon. All the other temples have something special but when I think back of this place, Bayon is the first that comes to mind. I loved it and I am so happy to have seen it!You can do elephant tours of it for $25 but they seemed very very wobbly and a bit overpriced. There were some real apsara dancers there posing for photographs."

The massive carvings are simply awesome. They're still so clearly detailed, even after more than a thousand years, and they really give the place a breathtaking appeal.Yet, the myriad of incredibly intricate carvings along the walls of the second and third levels are not to be missed. They depict some amazing parts of the Khmer history in stunning detail, showing battles being fought, and everyday life of hunting, cooking and even cock fighting. There's plenty to explore at this magnificent site, so wear comfortable walking shoes and take plenty of drinking water. Oh, and be sure your camera battery is fully charged.

My friends who have been to Siem Reap on tours to visit the temples often say that one can easily get an \u201cover dose\u201d of temples, and their conclusion is, that they ( meaning the temples) are all about the same! The truth is far from this.Unless you have a very special interest for ancient history, culture and architecture, it\u2019s better with the limited time during a short visit to follow the advice of the Siem Reap\u2019s Visitor\u2019s Guide, \u201c Any itinerary should include the legendary Angkor Wat and Bayon.\u201d This I did and added in the Ta Phrom made famous not only by the film Tomb Raiders, but is popular also by the massive fig and silk-cotton trees growing from the ruins.I visited the Bayon in the morning about 7.30 am with a Guide.The giant stone faces of the Bayon evoked a strange eerie feeling when I approached the site. More than 200 impassive faces on 54 towers appeared like sentinels guarding mysterious secrets of past events. Some researchers think that these are the faces of the bodhisattva Avalokitshvara, while others think they represent the king Jayavarman.The Bayon is built on three levels. The bas-reliefs on the exterior walls of both the first and second levels are worth spending some time looking at, as they depict the scenes from the historical battle between the Khmer and the Cham, and the scenes of everyday life. Scenes that can be clearly made out are naval battles, childbirth, hunting, marketing, cooking, men playing chess game, cock fighting, etc. View pictures attached.I went to the Bayon in the early morning to avoid the crowds, and noisy tourists. It\u2019s cooler and the rising sun allows for more interesting photography with the light falling at an angle. I was fortunate I had a guide who knew many of the best angles to take pictures, and hence maximized the preciously short time I had. The previous day I visited Angkor Wat, and strangely did not expect the Bayon to be as, if not more, interesting than the former. Perhaps because the staring faces evoke some personal attention, the feeling of presence, that big brother is watching you! It's a photographer's dream to be there. Or simply sit and look, reflect, and imbibe the magic and mystery of the place.Tip: Go early morning when it\u2019s cooler. Avoid the crowds. Bring walking shoes, a hat, and drinking water. Ensure that your camera battery is fully charged!"

            "review": "Excellent & not to be missed-go in the afternoon to avoid the crowds!. Bayon temple is part of the amazing Angkor Thom complex, situated in the heart of Siem Reap. A short distance away from the main attraction, Angkor Wat temple, it is the first of 7 temples in the tourist complex, right after you are dropped off by your tuk-tuk driver. After Bayon, you continue walking on to several more temples(which includes the Elephant terrace), each progressively getting smaller & smaller, till you finally exit the gate where the tuk tuk drivers are waiting. Since there are already so many reviews & the pictures themselves say a thousand words, I will restrict my review to just a few tips that others might find useful:1.Enter at the East Gate & work your way to the other temples after viewing Bayon-as mentioned, Bayon is the best preserved one, the others getting progressively smaller in size. You could do it the other way, but after a couple of hours walking, you would probably be too exhausted to really appreciate the beauty of the temple. In this case, save the best for first!2. There is lots & lots of walking! And steep climbing too. At one point, in one of the temples, we saw a sign that said children under the age of 12 are not allowed to climb up the uppermost viewing platform. The climbs up are very steep & I think it\u2019s a great idea to restrict children below a certain age, in case they fall. Both going up & coming down all those temples there are by incredibly narrow stairs. Definitely no place for a young child or anyone who needs help walking.3. Be dressed appropriately. These are temples & though there is no real dress code, there are signs that ask you to cover up. We actually saw the guard pull someone from the line because she had on a tank top & a tiny pair of shorts. Best attire would be a t-shirt, capris & sneakers- all the people dressed that way were let through, so I guess the length of the shorts & the tiny tank top she had on was the problem. Imagine making it all the way to Bayon & then not being able to climb up to get the magnificent views from the top.We really liked Bayon- its calm & serene & not the hub of activity that Angkor Wat is. Schedule at least 3-4 hours, get your hats & water, get ready for plenty of walking & enjoy. The beauty is simple breathtaking!One more tip- go in the early morning or late afternoon- we were there late afternoon after lunch & it was fairly devoid of tourists(as the pictures show!)"

I advice you to go there between 12.30pm and 2pm. Less people than earlier or later during the day. All the groups get back to Siem Reap for having lunch. Au that moment this is peaceful and with a nice light for taking pictures"

It has a unique and interesting style, with dozens of towers topped by smiling Buddha faces (four per tower, one facing each of the cardinal directions). The effect of this design is very impressive and though there is a lot of work needed and ongoing, the temple is in a suitably good state of preservation to appreciate it. If you have time to see more than just Angkor Wat then Bayon should be next on your list.The downside is that this is a fairly small temple, especially compared to a place like Angkor Wat, and because of it's unique style it is a popular stop for tourists. This combination means that the place can be a zoo. This was one of the most crowded tourist attractions I've been to anywhere. We were there during the morning rush and it was extremely difficult to walk around or get a nice picture. I've heard that it can be less crowded at lunch time or late afternoon, but cannot confirm. Go in expecting the worst and you may be pleasantly surprised."

They will show you the best spots for a picture and are excellent photographers. They will also give you a great history lesson and can answer just about any questions you have. I would not recommend that you book through a tour agency or hotel though. The packages are over priced. Just book a guide for $30 for the entire day, and travel buy tuk tuk. On top of that its $20 per person for one day at the temples ($40 for 3 days). If you book through an agency you end up having to pay for this temple passes anyway!

Even without modern building technologies, the Bayon temple, which was said to have been built in the 12th century, has survived the ravages of time and today standing as a testimony of the great civilization which had built it.Due to the sheer size of the temple, you need to spend quite some time wandering around and taking in the sights in order for you to understand the sheer enormity of this wonderful structure. Do ensure your have your camera with you as there many wonderful sights to capture. Also do make sure you are dressed lightly as the weather can be rather hot and stuffy. And one more thing...do watch your steps as the stairs here can be quite steep."

It was said to have 37 towers all in all. This place was very crowded, and everyone was busy taking photographs! Bayon is just full of photo opportunities. The best would be when the monks visit; and they are normally very friendly and obliging to pose for photos if you ask.Bayon is definitely famous for the faces; but the reliefs on the surrounding walls are quite an amazement too. Some are still in high details, good conditions. If you have time, go along the surrounding walls and enjoy the reliefs.Wear a hat, and bring water as it can be very hot in the open."

I spent a week in Siem Reap and visited all the temples, well almost all, but I have to say the temple that left the biggest impression was Bayon. It felt \"less restored\" which means you got the feeling you were seeing the actual temple, not someone's reconstruction of it. There was lots to see. It was very picturesque. If you are viewing the temples in chronological order, you will probably want to start with this one as it is the last one built, then work backwards through time. Doing it this way allows you to see the changes in religious beliefs of the area, and small architectural changes. It's all so overwhelming so if you pick a theme, such as chronological, it can help bring order to it all making it more enjoyable."

But you are pretty much free. There is a multitude of stone faces carved and many towers which surround a main tower, you can visit varying levels, although the stairs are steep they are not as much so as some of the other temples. The place is in good condition considering it being 12th or 13th century.This place has plenty of photo opportunities. We felt we didn't need a guide and stuck to our book, we could take our time and enjoy our visit. from Bayon you can pretty much go to the other temples near by on foot and meet your tuk tuk driver somewhere else.

With 54 towers and more than 200 faces, and the center prasat as high as 14 stories building, the temple is simple magnificent (of course, magnitud wise less than Angkor Wat). Bayon is around 2 km northward from Angkor Wat. We will passby the great south gate of Angkor Thom in between. My advice, avoid putting in Bayon together with Angkor Wat in a same itinerary, unless you have a very strong feet (as it was too much for most of my family members). The temple is much more exposed than Angkor Wat. So, sufficient sunscreen/sunblock or an umbrella might help. Try to climb to the top of the temple to see the faces closely. The feeling is very different from just watching them afar down the entrance. I am quite agree with the reviewer saying that an pre-visit enrichment of knowledge about this place is essential, or else, we might just inteprete the whole Angkor Archeological Park as a pile of stones in ruins.Pay a little bit of attention to the bas-reliefs on Bayon, as the stories told are more focused on daily life, instead of more religion-liked at Angkor Wat. The bas-relief inscribed how Khmer Empire built all the great ancient temples as well.

It has 216 huge smiling faces of the King Jayavarman VII as the Buddha's reincarnation, faces one of the four directions. Fifty-one smaller towers surrounded the central tower. The faces are carved with lips, eyes and each tower has four massive heads carved into its top. I loved the layout of the temple and this temple is one of my favourite temple. I took many pictures here."

            "review": "Unforgettable. This temple is one of my favourite, not to mention Angkor Wat. It is famous of its giant stone faces. There is 216 faces in the whole temple ( 54 towers/ 4faces each). Probably Faces represent Buddha or Bodhisattwa Avalokiteshvara. Built in the late 12th century or early 13th century by Jayavarman VII, first floors are a pantheon dedicated to the gods Khmers of the beginning of its construction, in a time of transition between the Hinduism and the Buddhism. The superior floor is dedicated to Buddha. Fabulous low reliefs of 1200m of length and representing more than 11000 sculptured persons, very long frescoes telling the fights and the naval battles between the Khmers and the Chams, as well as the daily life.."

For all those who want to visit this complex be sure have a good guide book or book yourself a tour guide because if you don't know anything about Bayon Temple then all that you will see there are just pile of stones carved with faces. Do your own research before arriving in Siem Reap so you could appreciate the temples. I will not recommend any guide but all hotels and guest houses in Siem Reap could arrange that for you. This complex is mostly open air so it is best if you wear light clothes and bring an umbrella to protect you from the midday sun and the rain.This is also where you can ride on top of an elephant and have a tour around the surrounds of Bayon."

Each of the numberous towers has four faces of Buddha, one facing each cardinal point. Anywhere you are in this temple, there are numerous Buddhas smilely down upon you. The layout of the temple itslef is also interesting. It is built on more of a circular plan than the other tempples in the area.This temple is a definate must-see."
