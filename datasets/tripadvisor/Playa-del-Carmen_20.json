            "review": "Vacationers Beware. Please do not purchase anything, as far as souvenirs, at the first price they tell you. It is a buyers market. Please be wise with your money. Most things you can get from 20% to 50% cheaper, just by walking away, after having them in your hands. Travel with small bills and exchange dollars or Euros into pesos before you get there. There are many choice to purchase souvenirs. The strip is almost three miles long. You can walk early and avoid the sun, crowds, pick pockets, drug traffickers and hustlers. You can eat at many nice places, however there are some places that just looking at them, they are not to nice. It is a fun time walking together as a family down and back on the strip. The beach in Playa is so much better than Canc\u00fan. It is a little more expensive to stay in Playa than in CANC\u00daN, but it is still nice to visit. Stay safe, alert and be prepared for many changes to the Quinta Avenida. With Cuba opening up, there will be a lot of lost tourism that will hit Playa. Have a great time."

A street about 2 to 3 miles long that has something for everyone. Restuarants, stores, bars, tours and about anything else you can think of. Did some shopping, eating and drinking. If you are near Playa Del Carmen you have to check it out. There are some really nice hotels within a block or two of the street and on the beach. I think our next trip we'll stay in one of those resorts so we can walk to 5th Avenue. Great time."

Countless stores selling the same thing over and over again mixed in with bars, restaurants and some big named stores.The amount of stores selling rubbish tat made in China is insane, they all sell the same stuff so if you're determined to get some gifts I guess you come here.Thing is competition is fierce so you will be harassed every five steps at times. Sometimes it's a simple welcome , sometimes it's a rude comment but either way they want you in. It's a pain, you can't relax and don't dare reply in your own language as thats a sign for them to lie. Just shake your head or even better ignore.You will also be offered drugs on numerous occasions, even if there is an armed policeman standing right there as we found. Again ignore.The places to eat are also full of scams, from guitar players demanding tips to hardselling of personalised Tequilla bottles. Saying that the food was ok generous portions, but beware it's English prices so don't expect a bargain. A good one to look for is Aldo's ice cream - great stuff!As mentioned in other reviews it does have brand stores which sell nothing you can't get at home and are the same price but a good reason to visit is that they have air con which believe me is very refreshing!If you get the Collectivo the gift shop just before the pick up station does sell genuinely different sorts of stuff so look out for that. The Collectivo point is 3 blocks down from 2nd avenue btw or just follow the big red and white tower.Overall if you're desperate for last minute gifts or a starbucks then I guess you will visit here but please don't make it a must do for your trip, it really isn't worth it."

Hundreds of vendors mostly selling the same crappy souvenirs, but it has charm and Mexican flair. Bought 2 wrestlers masks for about $17 each. Not bad quality and not bad bartering for a newbie. Helped that I speak Spanish but all the vendors speak English. Bought some bracelets and a junkie pair of sunglasses. Went by taxi for about $40 round trip (15 miles each way). At one point it's Downtown Disney. At the other point it's Dirty Vegas. Liked them both, will be going back before we leave."

            "review": "Why travel to Mexico for what you get back home? Try other streets.. While Quinta Avenida has a lot ot enjoy, in terms of sights, sounds, smells, etc, a good chunk of the experience is oriented towards tourists. What that really means is a big hit to the wallet, because you're going to pay US/Canadian prices on most things. Not to mention, what's the use of traveling to such a wonderful destination, only to visit some of the same chains that you likely have back home (for the same price, to boot)?You're going to be solicited by every other shop owner, trying to get you inside, along with people trying to sell you various tours. If you planned you trip properly, you won't need to listen to a word they say. They're usually nice, so a firm \"no\" will end these encounters.My advice: start heading away from the beach, and check the other streets. I won't take you long to start finally feeling like you're really in Mexico. Playa del Carmen is a very walk-able town, and you should enjoy what it has to offer. And if you want to pay the Mexican price for things, you need to get away from Quinta Avenida anyway."

It can be a little unnerving having the shop and stand owners coming up to you begging you to see there store, but if you can get beyond that it is a fun experience. Watch out for the oncoming sales pitches from shopworkers claiming to be moonlighting at sales and remembering you from your resort where they say they work their normal job. I fell for it the first time i heard it, and then realized it is a local prank after it happened again. I had it happen about twenty times before our trip was completed. Depending on your mindset, it can either be annoying or humorous. Lot's of great restaurants. We loved El Fabuloso the best. There is also an inexpensive restaurant owned by Iron Chef Canada winner Xavier Perez Stone on 34th just off of Quinta Avenida. The food is Very authentic and there are some fairly exotic selections on the menu...."

They get you going to the beach, on the way to the Cozumel Ferry, coming back from lunch or dinner. They are just hustling for your dinero, Gringo! So play your part. Buy something! You don't need to be rude, you really don't have to be ripped off. I saw a tourist walking down the street with a paper bag on his head in the mid day sun - BUY A FREAKIN' HAT! You just walked past at least 10 stores that sell them for less than 10 bucks. SHEESH!Don't shop at Old Navy or any other store you have back home. Explore a little. Find a little something for your niece or nephew or that elderly lady in the next apartment. A spoon rest for Mom. Use your imagination. The vendors have to hustle every day. They don't make much.

Now, it's over 20 blocks of shopping and restaurants. It offers everything from cheesy, velvet sombreros to 5 star eateries. You can't walk five feet without someone trying to sell you something. After a few blocks, this can become an annoyance. Learn to say, \"No gracias senior\" and keep walking! Also many will say remember me from the hotel, or last night? Anything to strike up a conversation. The first several blocks are mostly old souvenir shops and Mexican restaurants. Further up to 30th and 40th you'll find newer eateries and stores , including a couple of open air malls. Although restaurants are cheaper here, clothing is no bargain (except for Playa t-shirts). The best part of Quinta is people watching. It's a bizarre, colorful parade! Grab a cheap taco and beer and sit back and enjoy!"

If you are looking for a nice walk go early, before 10AM. Fewer vendors and cooler temps make this a great way to get exercise, and you can catch breakfast at Carboncitos, or La Cueva del Chango at 38th. You'll find good silver vendors between 2nd and 5th, and Cuban cigars at that end of the avenida, too. We prefer the section north beyond Avenida 20, a little more laid back. Be alert, and ignore the hawkers who greet you with, \"Remember me?\" Chances are this is the first meeting, and is not your hotel concierge. If you are up for a nice, long walk, the Avenida extends north to several beach access points all the way to Avenida 110, or south to the ruins of Xaman Ha, inside Playacar. A varied shopping experience, easy walking, best in the AM to avoid gregarious vendors."

We were hoping to see something a little less commercial and more authentic than what we'd heard about Cancun. We were unprepared!Shortly after leaving the taxi a gentleman from our hotel restaurant spotted us, came over to say 'hello', and invited us to visit his shop. We were expecting a little trinket shop, maybe with some leather works and sugar skulls, and would have been happy to buy an item or two as gratitude for the friendly service. The shop was a jewellery one, and being unprepared, and too polite to walk away, my husband grudgingly spent \u00a3200 on a pendant for me, and \u00a340 on a sugar skull for a friend, and I bought some earings for \u00a340. Back in England those items would have been at least half the price! That's what we found walking further down the avenue also.We were ready for the next member of hotel staff when they took us the their shop, and all along the avenue there were other shop owners trying to call us in. My husband found himself rather on the edge by the time we left, heading home early.About a third of the shops were tourist ones, all with the same stock. The less commercial looking ones were dishonest, quoting one price for goods, but without exact change, taking everything you handed over, saying that was the price they'd quoted. There were a few bars and restaurants, which we didn't go to as our money was pretty much wiped out in that first shop, they looked good though. There was also the rare genuine shop or stall, and these were actually a pleasure to browse and shop in.We were naive and too polite for our own good. Be warned!"

The Avenue starts just in front of one of the Playacar main entrances; we were staying in Sandos Playacar Hotel & resort.You can walk through almost 2 miles, but you won't see much difference in the shops when you have already walked 5 blocks.The shopping Mall is at the end of the way, but it is not really worth; it is not a bargain.You can get lots of souvenirs, all of them with skulls or the Playa del Carmen writing.Perhaps, if you look well, you can get some nice silver jewelry. I bought for my wife a very nice bracelet in 925 genuin silver with onix for only 220 USA dollars in the very fashion jewelry store inside the Sandos Hotel."

We remember it being simple with more local businesses than the fancy new tourist shops and chain stores. Either way, it is still fun to visit and to have lunch, dinner and drinks. There are souvenier shops everywhere and all I can do is encourage you to shop around and some stores are much less expensive then others depending on what you are buying. If you are looking for alcohol, stop by La Europea in the shopping mall located beetween Avenida Constituyentes and Calle 16 norte on the Quinta Avenuda. This was my fist visit and I confirmed prices were definately cheaper than anywhere else! I am often asked about safety and I can confirm safety is not an issue on the Quinta Avenida and nearby side streets. There are tourists galore and security roaming around everywhere. We have walked to Wal-Mart and Mega off of the Quinta each year and never felt in any danger. Just remember that if you don't feel safe, then don't do it. Stay in the well populated areas and you will be fine.Quinta has become more commercialized each year. We stopped going to Cancun years ago because of this. It felt like we were visiting Los Angeles with all the same chain restaurants and shops. Quinta is slowly becoming the same with the addition of shopping malls and high end retail stores. As an example, there is now an Old Navy at the south end near the Cozumel Ferry.No matter what, Quinta Avenida is a MUST for anyone visiting the Riviera Maya! Enjoy!"

Beware of these guys - they know how to play the game. They know all of the bracelets and will say \"Hey, remember me? I was your waiter last night at [your hotel name]\" Guess what - they were not your waiter. It's fun to mess around with them though and let them think you believe them.

For souvenir shopping however I recommend walking around the side streets and exploring a bit further. We ended up buying cute shot glasses and magnets for a third of the price on a side street close to the \"La Mega\" supermarket. And by the way, for your tequila shopping definitely go to the supermarket and not to a touristy store.Like another visitor commented below, the \"remember me from the hotel\" scam is a classic way to lure you into shops. I didn't realize it until much, much later and I am so glad to read his review because it confirms my suspicion ;)From Quinta I recommend \"La N,20\", a nice restaurant/bar next to the H&M store where drinks are good and ambiance is even better. Didn't try the food since we were staying at an \"all inclusive\", but the music there was really good. On the corner of Quinta and Av. Constituyentes, check out \"Ah Cacao\" for some gourmet gifts and fancy - delicious - chocolate."

Priced items are the preferred prices for the seller, but not necessarily the sale price. Have fun and test your skills. My wife saved nearly 65% on a necklace for our daughter. A word of caution though \u2013 one of the \u201chooks\u201d used by street vendors is that they are on their day off from working at the resort. After a couple of times hearing \u201cHey! Remember me \u2013 <name> from the hotel?\u201d I decided to ask which hotel. The vendor got the right resort (by the Paradisus wrist band), but the wrong hotel at the resort.

There is something there for everyone: Restaurants, shops, hotels, you name it! It's a \"Don't Miss It\" destination! Do yourself a favor and go!"

Do be aware, however, that many sales people will approach you as if they know you from the resort you are staying in (and if you wear a bracelet, they can tell which one). If you aren't up for anything more than window shopping, best not to stop and chat. Just nod, smile and walk away."

There are a lot of places to change your money, but most people take dollars and credit cards. Some will prefer dollars, but make sure you ask their exchange rate because it might be a better deal to pay in pesos. There's a lot of people vying for your attention, don't get distracted by them..just say no thanks and keep moving if you're not interested. Please, go visit the Cigar Factory. There's an older man who rolls the cigars by hand, he's a very nice man. They have a mall now, which may appeal to the richer vacationers. Bathrooms in Mexico, as you are aware are hard to find. Most shops will say they don't have a bathroom and if they do they always want money, but this street it's a little easier to find one without having to pay. I found that Starbucks in the beginning of the mall has a great bathroom,although single stall: and there's a/c throughout the mall. I feel everything is way too expensive in this area, even the food. For some reason, they have restaurants that claim to be real Mexican food, but it's more like fancy food for the richer citizen. My husband is from Jalisco, and we go to Mexico often. We are used to street food (tacos, corn, tamales), sadly you won't find it on this street. Some of the roads which lead to the beach look sketchy and clubby. I'm sure if you're young, and you like that sort of thing, there are tons of bars to go to. I feel the beach/area has changed quite a bit since the last time we came (6 years ago). Seems extremely commercialized, with less beach and more businesses. Even though this seems like more of a bad review, it's not. Many will fall in love with this place, it's perfect for the younger crowd with plenty of hostels and hotels, and bars. Photographers- this is a great place for different backgrounds. You'll love it. Enjoy!"

It's good for a visit and maybe lunch, but ask someone, such as your concierge or a native you take a tour with, where else you can find the items you want. We did and got ceramics for a reasonable price."

Over the past several years we have watched as it has changed from a laid back place to eat, shop, and interact with locals to a commercial center with a big mall with Victoria's secret, Bath & Body Works, etc.A few Mexicans I've spoken with said they have trouble even using pesos at some of the stores.This has led to even more aggressive sales techniques from the local vendors to try to keep up.Not what I want to see when I go on vacation, but that's my opinion."

There are lots of great shops to get all sorts of authentic gifts, accessories, memorabilia and apparel at great prices. There is also a great view and access to the ocean. Be prepared to spend the day here because if you have a set few hours, you won't see it all. Especially if you are looking for name brand things. The other shops have pretty much the same stuff from shop to shop with some occasional uniqueness. It was nice going from place to place to get a good deal though. If you do go, understand that the prices are WAY better than at your hotel. But there are some things to beware of:1. Don't buy silver from the vendors that don't have a store with a register and receipt with their store name on it. Almost all of the silver on the street is plated. They will tell you it's real but most often it's not. It may last a couple of weeks but then your finger will turn green. This is true even if it has the stamp on the inside. (Learned this from our awesome taxi driver.2. Always negotiate prices down and buy at the third or 4th price. This will be a fair price for you and still allow them to make money. We bought my daughter a ring that three wanted $200 US for at first. By the time we left they were offering $60. (We didn't want to spend that much on a ring yaaaas she might lose) we went back later and got it for $25. Same thing happened with my hat.3. If you don't have a way to exit or feel bad about cutting people off, shop owners will keep you for 20, 30 40 minutes. Strangely enough, if you tell them you are leaving tomorrow they back off (not sure why).4. Lastly. Do not talk to the people that are everywhere with tour information. They are for Time Shares. And this is not like going to Orlando, Florida where you get tickets to Universal Studios or Disney World. They will tell you it is 90-120 minutes and never let you go. Waste a day of your vacation and some will even make you pay for your own taxi back of you don't buy. Not worth your time. It was fun and we made some nice purchases. Just go with the right expectations and enjoy the atmosphere."

There are an abundance of restaurants to choose from offering a variety of meals. There are ice cream parlours, delicious but expensive.

You can eat, do shopping , go to the beach if you want, or just take a walk, its well crowded place.Best place to go there is taxi and you can arrange the departure at the same time you combine an hour and a meeting place and the taxi will be thereI think It worth at least a night to go there.Hope you like it."

After beach-pool-beach-pool-and more pool, it's nice the put on dry clothes and walk a bit! My daughter enjoyed the colorful shops, and the overal ambiance which is very different from where we live! For me, well, it is what it is: touristic street for visiting tourists!I enjoyed the fact that the large souvenir shops have fixed prices, great aircon, and stock not only souvenirs, but also medicine and other items that are almost at the same price as Walmart (bought umbrellas there, which is the best way to beat the sun and heat imo). I ended up buying some ceramic souvenirs, while buying other stuff at Walmart. It's fun to walk up and down as there are no cars, it is well maintained, some shops and hotels are really pretty, shop people try to sell you things but will not insist too much, restaurants are good, some have great corner terraces with views of the beach. Safety: I felt safe being there alone with a young child, even in the evening. Most people there we families as well. Warning: some guys will spot your resort bracelet and come up to you and say very convincingly: 'Hi, I'm Juan from your resort, today is my day off, can I show you my (insert family member)'s shop?\" I had read about this but only had it happen once in the few visits to this place. For fun, I just went along, it was broad daylight and nothing was dangerous. It was kind of funny to see how motivated the guy was, he spoke great English. I didn't buy anything at his aunt's (ahem) jewelry shop, nor his cousin's (!) leather shop! One thing puzzles me: how can all these shops survive???"

I wanted to do that but we ran out of time but we will in our next visit!

All of the typical tourist trap souvenirs are available along its length, along with (imo) over-priced drinks and treats. However it is tourist central, especially for those with limited Spanish language skills (Spanish is NOT necessary anywhere along Avenida Quinta).It was fun to do a little people watching along Avenida Quinta, but for my personal tastes and meals, I prefer to go inland a few blocks to where the locals are. Also I found the prices much better a few blocks inland too..... but you cannot be afraid to get off of the beaten path to uncover these local gems."

There are a few unique stores/designers place that are worth seeing. The rest are just souvenirs stores that sells the same crap. It is better to buy these souvenirs items in the Grocery store off 5th (Chedraui, Mega, Walmart, Soriana). Same thing but cheaper: Tshirts, Ceramics, tequilla...Do shop around for tours and bargain when you are a bigger group. Also, if you are a family, some tours are not nescessary. Just take the collectivo or rent a car and pay your own entrance fee. It would be at least 1/5 of the tour price! If you want to explore more... Continue to walk on 5th when it is not commercial anymore (after 46th). You will find houses with beautiful Graffiti Artworks (see pics).If you are a good sport, keep walking on 5th til 112. Turn right... You will find the \"secret beach\" with a small lagoon of fresh water that goes into the ocean.Our favorites on 5th:Clothes: Psylo Fashion / designer clothing store corner of Calle 20. Betshka a sister company of Zara. Price is excellent! Great place to shop if you have teens! Food: Ambasciatta d'Italia / Douceurs de France/ Ahh Cacao"

Of course \"bargaining\" is part of purchasing with some of the tiendas & I got great deals just by asking! A little spanish, even if broken is appreciated ! Of course the big name stores have set prices, so make sure to exchange your money. Having your money right sometimes gets you a better deal! Many of the stores accept major credit cards & US Dollars. Trust me, we enjoyed buying presents for our loved ones so much, we bought another suitcase just for all the trinkets from our travels . Also, wear comfortable shoes & be prepared to walk the whole avenue. Don't worry there are plenty of restaurants, eateries, bars, clubs along the way to grab a snack or drink (or two) as well."

Year after year, I watched 5th Avenue grow - brick by brick, shop by shop, one more street closed every year. NOW...instead of Italian food zone and Mexican food zone, all I noticed was everyday American stores! Why go all the way to Mexico and visit amazing Quinta Avenida just to find new \"malls\" featuring shops like \"forever 21.\""

Some of them were quite funny, saying things like \"come in my store, let me sell you some things you don't need\" and \"come in my store, let me rip you off just a little bit\". We didn't really buy anything, but we weren't looking for anything. It's just fun to look around. Most of the stores have the same things at varying prices. Most things do not have prices on them, I think they make it up as they go. And they always start out by saying they are giving you a deal. My son was looking at a statue of the Predator character, the guy was telling him it was $450 pesos, but he would give him a deal of $400 pesos. My son happened to flip the thing over and it had a price tag of $300 pesos on it!! Needless to say we walked away. I just laughed at the guy. Interestingly, as we walked down the street, 5 or 6 stores later a guy it front of his store called out to my son and said \"you looking for a Predator\"? So obviously they communicate with each other (the same people probably own all the stores!). This guy was more willing to do a deal. All in all, it's worth the trip, just don't go looking for quality merchandise and great deals. Lots of restaurants and places to stop for a drink."

And you can get some really good deals. The people watching on 5th Avenue is world class!!!! I can't say enough about it. Grab a giant margarita and just sit back and watch. If you like Tequila then this is a really good place to purchase it. Many of the shops will allow you to taste your Tequila before you buy. This is a real benefit if you are picky about your beverages. Sometimes you have to have thick skin because drugs and sex can be offered however if you firmly decline they will leave you alone. As a matter of fact they knew my face and they would joke \"keep it clean around him\". So we got along just fine. I highly recommend a few trips to 5th Avenue."

Quinta Avenida I believe is the Spanish version. 5th Avenue is closed to vehicle traffic and is one and one half miles of shops, jewelry stores, cigar stores, clothing stores both very high end and low end, bars and restaurants. In the morning many of the tourists will do their exercise for the day before the shops open either walking or jogging. After the shops open, most around 10 am, it starts to get busy. Since there are so many large nearby resorts of US, Canadian and European tourists mixed in with small hotels on or near 5th avenue that cater to Mexican tourists, there is a great amount of walking traffic. In the daytime it is very warm or very hot--your choice depending on the time of year. Many tourists wait until the late afternoon to visit. In the early evening the restaurants get busy as do the bars. The streets are full of people and you will see strolling Mariachi bands playing for dollar contributions. Starting on the south end there is a large complex of high end shopping for clothing, watches, home goods and other items and of course a few dining spots. The ferry crossing to Cozumel is also located on the south end on the waterfront which is one block from 5th avenue. Also at this location is a small chapel and the central park with 5th Avenue on one side and the beach on the other. The souvenir shops start here. My favorite is the shop in the pink building across from the Chapel. Going north from there is the bus station and many, many shops, restaurants and bars. To get the real picture of the location, look up 5th Avenue, Playa del Carmen on Trip Advisor and see what others have posted or use the internet on U-Tube or on Google or Yahoo photos"

I was able to find plenty of 2 for 100 pesos deals on Mexican blankets (which was the only souvenir I wanted!)... Just be aware of a few things:1- tourist area so be careful with your bill to be sure they aren't ripping you off2- if you pay with pesos you will save money... ALWAYS. So find an atm that partners with your bank and get pesos out to be prepared! 3- lots of guys asking during the day and night if we were \"tryin to get high\"... They weren't pushy, just a bit surprising to see.4- better prices and authentic food can be found by just going North a street or two to 10th, 15th, and 20th Avenidas... all walking distance from Quinta Avenida."

The list of stores, restaurants, and tourist novelties runs the spectrum from Mom & Pop to Globally recognized centers of Luxury and Fashion. The convenience for my family vacation is knowing that pharmacies are abundant and prices are reasonable. Those who desire a shopping experience will not be disappointed. While big brand shopping is not my thing I do geek out for Mexican Surf brand Squalo which has 2 stores on this strip. I would encourage anyone seeking Mexican Cultural Art fused with Surfing images to visit Squalo or even better KukulCanvas off Quinta Avenida, they have the latest trend in pre-Colombian indigenous theme art with culture infused with modern twists.Craft Beers and Tequila are well supplied and available for the most discriminating taste on Quinta. Restaurants are diverse and range for fun-seeking to family friendly.The drawback is the Heat and some suspect appearances! Be prepared to perspire regardless of the time of day. Hydrate and just accept the fact that you are dealing with the elements. Shade and AC are deceptively available but surprisingly insufficient. There are some alarming vendors who will strike conversations, make comments, or ask a ton of questions to reel you in. They are most often trying to be friendly and make some business. Be wary of your surroundings and travel with company as much as possible. Quinta has so much to offer including hotels and hostels mixed with services, stores, restaurants, and just about anything a market or community can offer. Handle the heat & distractions and just get over it and enjoy your stay in Playa."

They will encourage you to pay by card. Mexican chip and pin machines do not show the value when you put in your number. You are then given a receipt to sign. Only then will you get a receipt that shows they have charged you 25%+ more than the quoted price. When you question this they get very aggressive and lots of their \"friends\" appear giving very little choice put to leave.

The Mexican Outlet store was a great place for shopping many items in one location.

Quinta Avenida is a pedestrian-only street filled with restaurants, shops and entertainment that stretches for about 40 blocks. There are many types of ethnic restaurants, casual dining, fine dining, coffee houses, dessert stands and everything in between. There are local mom-and-pop stores, to large corporate chain malls. Personally, I like the character of the smaller merchants more than the H & M or Victoria's Secret of the malls. You can get those at home. Why come all the way to Playa del Carmen for corporate America? Hopefully, the large corporate chains and their malls don't take over what is otherwise the charm and draw of Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue.)The street is hustling and bustling day and night. Close to the beach just a couple of blocks from the water, you can stay at any number of hotels and be just steps away from some of the best restaurants in town. 5th Avenue is also steps away from the bus station and ferry dock, so no matter how you get there, it's convenient. Most stores take credit cards and there are plenty of places to exchange money. There are also side streets off 5th Avenue with more shops and restaurants, often with better prices, but nothing beats the liveliness and excitement of 5th Avenue. We were there in June and while it was hot and humid during the day, the nights were breezy and cool, which made strolling the avenue all the more enjoyable. The area is very safe and there are always people out and about."

I was very surprised to find a limited number edition Spurs watch there for less than what I would pay at home. Most of the stores have prices on the merchant and because they were already less than what I expected, I didn't bother bargaining. You can find pretty much any souvenir you're looking for and at good prices. There is a huge Nike store which came in very handy because we weren't originally planning on going zip lining and I needed a pair of sneakers. The prices there are a little better than in the States and there's no tax. Pharmacies are almost every 4 stores so don't worry if you forgot something. The ferry to Cozumel is there too. There's more than just shopping with there...there's a beautiful park with entertainment daily and each side street leads you down to the beach. There are two malls with very Americanized stores as well too, so if you forget anything, you're bound to be able to pick it up at an excellent price. The best thing: pedestrians only....no cars!

This street has so much to offer including restaurants of all types, bars, night clubs, stores, local shops, tour stands, random parades, performers, and much more including a mall with H&M and other stores.On the far end of Quinta Avenida is a ferry dock. You can take a ferry to Cozumel for $15USD to $16USD. I recommend buying a 1 way ticket when you leave. There are multiple companies and they have different times for departures. It costs a little more but, gives you more flexibility to pick a different company with the time you want to leave.On the other end (opposite) of the ferry is where the night clubs are. Most do not open u til 10pm and then stay open until 6am. These are worth checking out if you're in the party mood. There is something for everyone.Overall, if you're in Playa del Carmen you don't want to miss this street. I think it really makes the city."

You also need to remember to haggle at the little stores on prices as they will negotiate. They always start out really high & you can get items quite a bit less than quoted. There is also several massage places available for 2 people for $50 for an hour!!! We have tried several & received numerous fantastic massages for a huge discount compared to the hotel spas.

Our hotel was HM Playa Del Carmen which was within great walking distance to everything almost center in fact. The shop people weren't any more aggressive than what I would've expected or have experienced in Cozumel or Progressive. I just loved the whole strip and even joked with my husband about packing up, opening a shop and moving out there. There were kids dancing, restaurants galore.... I would definitely recommend Trip Advisor for food choices that's what we did and tons of shops local and big chain. There were places you could put your feet in and have the fish eat your feet $15. I personally didn't try it as I was too chicken but it was fun to watch people reactions. Maybe next time after a couple of drinks. Overall it was a safe place as we walked all hours of the day and night. The streets/alleys had tons of police patrolling. I would absolutely recommend this place if you like people watching, shopping and eating which who doesn't of course lol! The nightlife was equally exciting we enjoyed the club strip as well."

Most of the stores took visa and MasterCard and a few took American Express. It is super safe and there are many awesome restaurants to eat at as well. You can spend almost a whole day just going into stores and shooing around. Definitely a place to stop at. Everything is open and people are very friendly and there is plenty of security everywhere."

And when you say no they follow you abit and just nagging you. Im not a violent person but on quinta there have been so many times that I have wanted to slap them.

            "review": "Where to go for a few hours in Playa Del Carmen. I noticed when staying at the big resorts, that there is nowhere to get any souvenirs or anything like that without paying a huge mark-up. A $5-$10 cab ride from the resorts to 5th Ave is therefore worth it. A good place to spend a few hours walking around and seeing what the stores have to offer.So here are a few quick pros and cons.Pros:-Decent prices on items usually 5-6 times higher at the resorts such as sunscreen or diapers.-Many different types of stores to choose from. There are high end retailers and there are also street vendors.-Seems Credit Cards, Dollars, Pesos, whatever you got, they take.-Most of the people working the stores are on commission, yet none of them hassled me at all.-Starbucks and ice cream parlors everywhere to help ward off the sun.-It seemed that all the people we talked to spoke English.-There was a lot of usual trinket garbage, but also some very fine quality stuff at reasonable prices.-Many locally crafted items available.-Feels safe, you get the feeling that the locals keep trouble away so that tourists can shop in peace.-Finding a taxi to get back is easy as there are regulated taxi stands every two blocks.Cons:-Getting here is admittedly scary. Taxi's have to go down one lane roads littered with garbage and stray dogs, past run down buildings. More of a negative of the Mexican Gov than anything else. -A few underhanded \"barkers\" who try to get you into their store by saying that they were your waiter last night at your resort. Don't be fooled, they know where you are from because of the bracelet on your arm. Those stores are to be avoided.-A small gripe, but this is a long, and not flat street, so in the heat be prepared for a hike. Get plenty of water.Some tips I learned while there:-If you have a good no fee credit card, use that for purchases. Often the store would have a sign up that says a conversion of 17-1 for dollars, but on the credit card is was nearly 19-1 so you save money that way.-The store called Caravan has good stuff, as does Rosalita's. -Don't waste time getting hair braided here, it takes a long time and they will actually come to your resort beach to do it if you really want it done.-The white and turquoise cabs are the regulated cabs. Always take them."

It is a rather long stretch of stores and restaurants, but as you will find it seems like every block is pretty much the same. The name brand stores you will recognize do not offer any kind of noticeable discount, so if you are heading there to save money you will quickly realize that you won't. There are a lot of restaurants off the avenue, so check with Tripadvisor restaurant reviews to see which ones are highly rated. You will also be interrupted by pesky street vendors, just ignore them and keep walking and they leave you alone. There are the typical t-shirt type stores that all seem about the same with prices the same, so if you are looking for some trinkets don't spend too much time shopping around as they all seemed to be similarly priced. We were there during the day and after dinner, and in either case we felt completely safe at both times, everyone seems well behaved and no one gets out of line, so don't be concerned about going there after dark. It was very crowded at night and a lot more comfortable temperature wise as well."

We did get fish pedicure and the children had a blast. They say fish do not bite, but after we were done I realized that my husband's leg had small bleeding. I assume those tiny fishes liked his legs and glad that it was not one of the children. "

All souvenirs can be had, Tequila, t shirts, Nick knacks, bars, restaurants, pharmacy, supermarkets which are generally cheaper. 5 th avenue nice to walk down but unless you have a open credit card forget it. Plenty of quaint places to sit down and plenty of eateries. Was fed up with asking if we wanted drugs all the time, it appears to be worse than the previous 3 years when we visited. I usually stuck to supermarkets, you can buy almost everything here, otherwise you should haggle, although most is fake. Taxis are available all over and a bus station that goes all over"

We started to walk the beach just to AVOID this street. after like 20 times being asked for the same thing from the same people. If you LOVE to shop, dont buy your first thing you see, hit it end to end, then go back and haggle. Some places give you even a small bonus if you pay in US dollars. of course you get a 5% bonus, but the prices are 10 % higher. Everyone has to do this street a few times, just for fun.

You can sit at restaurants and people watch for hours. More and more high end stores (think Michael Kors) are locating on the 5th. It's the place to be."

The restaurants are interesting and the food is always good. 5th Avenue is made for the tourist such as yours truly and is fun to visit, spend some pesos and enjoy the day at the park. If you need something quieter just step over to 10th Avenue and it is there. All in all 5th Avenue is an excellent experience to visit in Playa Del Carmen, MX."

I'm not sure what Playa needs a Krispy Kreme for. A multi-level department store that sells everything. And a Burger King.

The latest PLOY is for a young man to come up to you and start talking to you, especially if you wear an all inclusive band on your wrist that gives away your hotel. The ploy is they say \"you don't recognise me from the Prinses Hotel\" (because the waiters wear hair nets now) \" I was your waiter, I don't look the same, do I. I have a side business come and take a look at our store\". The stores are off the main street, on one of the side streets. So be aware, they are NOT your waiter.If you love shopping and lots of people milling around and lots of choices for restaurants, then 5th Ave may be for you. As for us, not so much. An evening visit may have been better, lights, music and much cooler. 1 highlight though was the 4 men in colorful garb doing the Danza De Los Veladores, check it out at the south end of the Ave."

(After about 5 long conversations with tour salesmen, who I clearly told there was no chance I would buy a tour, who insisted that they just wanted to have a conversation that ultimately ended with them trying to sell me a tour - no surprise there - or offering to be my Mexican boyfriend, I was just completely over trying to be nice/polite to anybody.)I want to note that I never felt unsafe during my time on the Quinta Avenida, just annoyed and harassed. It certainly put a damper on things.I also want to note that this is NOT how I was treated elsewhere on my trip to Mexico, including in the very touristy areas and souvenir shop areas of Tulum and Puerto Vallarta.That being said, the Quinta Avenida has a good variety of souvenirs if you're in the market. Plus, a lot of the main attractions are located on the avenue.I would recommend trying to get off the Quinta Avenida as much as possible, since you'll find better and less expensive food elsewhere. Plus, you can avoid being harassed incessantly by street vendors! Yay!"

Two pieces of advice: #1, if you're American, have them charge everything in Pesos! At dinner, the bill said it was $90 in USD and it actually was around $74 once it posted. #2, don't ignore the sales people-acknowledge either with a smile and \"no, gracias\" if not interested or get ready to haggle! And per a locals advice, don't \"get into with\" the taxi drivers, but be sure to negotiate price before you get in. If you're a woman with a man, be prepared to be ignored unless you help with a sales pitch. It's a very male dominated society, but no one was at all rude and we never felt unsafe. The selection for food, drink, shops, excursions, massages, etc are endless. After 3 days visiting 5th Ave, I really loved it. We highly recommend La Fisheria and Puerto Cocina Urbana for food and drink."

Not just men yelling at us from the side of the street, no, they frequently came right up to us and stood in our path flirting, trying to entice us to try some restaurant or bar, etc. Not pleasant. We really came here to check out a store called Sol Jaguar, which was very small but had some terrific handcrafted items from Quintana Roo and really all over Mexico. We bought a couple of special things and quickly flagged a taxi to take us back to the hotel. I'm fairly sure he was gouging us a little on the price based on what we paid the taxi that the hotel staff place us in, but at that point, I was too happy to be back at the hotel to argue."

Most of the places all sell the same thing but if your looking for silver, check the prices carefully. We saved over $100USD by going to several silver stores and finding the exact bracelet for much, much cheaper. A lot of Mexicans trying to get you into their store and not someone else's. I guess we were expecting something more. Worth a visit but we wouldn't spend an entire day there."

The street is lined with shops, restaurants, and bars. I loved the variety of stores that range from very high-end to the local artisan shops. It is a great place for the whole family or for a romantic stroll with your significant other. Most restaurants have tables outside so you can pass the time \"people-watching\" as you sip on a cocktail. The street is also located about 2 blocks down from the beach. Next time I go, I will be ready to head to the beach after a day of shopping."

They want your money. But for food and gifts walk a few blocks away and you will find better prices. They want about $60 per day for car rentals and food is like if you are eating In the us. People here are really friendly. They are willing to help and explain where to go. The beaches are the best beaches probably in the world. Take lots of sun block beaches being close to the equator you get burned really fast. Not tanned but burn. Your skin will be red. Eating out. Try going outside the touristy area because you will pay a lot of money. Go further away from the main streets. Prices are three times less than what you will pay for in the main area. We learned the hard way. We spent about $100 in just two days just in food and beer for two. You will be paying about $30 a person. Take public transportation the ADO Is about sixty pesos which is about $5. It will take you to cancun and most destinations there like Xcaret xelha and xplorer but if you will be doing that I recommend the collectivo which is the common taxi will be about $35 peso one way. It's about $2. But all in all going to tulum they wanted $79 a person but we paid $20 for two with transportation taking the collectivo. The collectivo taxi is located off 20th street I believe. If you ask people they will tell you exactly where to go. The collectivo will take you to all of the cenotes. I recommend the cenote Eden, and Azul and also the cenote in Tulum called the main cenote. Very beautiful. The beaches in tulum are way better so try to go there. Expect people wanting tips for everything expect to have to pay and take extra change. All the sightseeing and everything is money there. Alcohol stops selling at 5pm outside the tourists spots because they double it on 5th Ave. so if you will be there for a while go to Walmart which is about 7 blocks from the main avenida and buy yourself food and lots of alcohol to take to the beach if that's your thing. If not water snacks and food to keep going. I recommend you bring a small ice chest those plastic ones so you can take to the beach and bring an umbrella as you will need it for when you go to the beach and to chichen itza and tulum. The sun is hard on you then you will have to buy it there. This way you can have it and be ready. "

There was a store named Caravan that was really nice for assessories.. At times you get harassed to \"look at my store\". But a small little no Gracis is enough to stop."

Our cab happened to drop us off over a mile away at the wrong store. That was an adventure. We found a great all purpose store for water shoes that were half the price of our resort. Same brand/quality. Cab drivers will negotiate and are friendly. Yes, I was approached by the \"guy that works at my resort\". Threw it back at him and we both ended up having a good laugh over it.

A blend of restaurants, shops, cafe's, bars, patio bars. specialty shops and high end plazas, The street has changed immensely in the five years since I first visited - it is amazing with some of the best restaurants in the Mayan Riviera located there.5th Ave has it all. Go at night - the street comes alive with mariachi bands, local acts - the street is alive. You can walk for miles. There are vendors trying to sell you the typical tourist stuff - but that is part of the charm of being in Mexico. The sellers right on 5th Ave. will barter - but not much. They get thousands of visitors a day and won't move a lot on their prices. Overall, the prices at all stores and restaurants are more than outlying areas - so be careful when buying since you can get it cheaper a few feet down a side street. All in all - a great way to spend a night taking in some of the sights of Mexico."

But remember you can bargain with locals. We were staying at a resort and had wristbands on. We noticed the locals knew where we were staying and approached us saying they were there come see their moms store. We decided to turn the wristband inside out and no one could tell where we were staying! The locals will approach you all over trying to get you in their stores. Don't go unless you want to. There are so many options for eating. We decided to go off 5th and found some very affordable restaurants. An fyi. There are clean public washrooms in the quinta mall. It is halfway up 5th Ave. "

While admittedly, this can be a bit bothersome at first, I have learned to actually enjoy it and usually get a good laugh or 2 every time I walk a portion of 5th.I have been to Playa around 10 times total and 5-6 times in the last 2+ years. So, I have walked portions of 5th all the way to the ever-expanding end (currently around 38th) literally hundreds of times. Businesses come and go but there are pretty much 2 constants: 1- things change here a lot more than average. this means businesses closing and new ones opening up, as well as the northward expansion of the \"tourist zone\", and 2- you WILL get propositioned or enticed multiple times and in a variety of manners on your walk here!There are a variety of different shops here... mostly in 2 main categories: 1- tourist shops with souvenirs, etc and Spa/Massage places. You will not get \"bugged\" to enter the big tourist stores because those are under a much different ownership model. These employ multiple people who get paid by the hour, so there is no incentive for them to try to pluck you off of 5th. By contrast, the smaller shops are usually run by their owner or have an employee who works directly for commission. This is why you will see many people approach you while walking down 5th... because these people make nothing unless you buy something from their store. Also, you should be aware these people will use a variety of tricks to entice you into their store. Many of these guys are quite smart and I have seen them fool dozens of tourists first hand. However, there is no fowl play afoot... they are simply trying to get you to enter their store in the hopes you will buy something. The most common trick continues to be the \"I was your waiter at your hotel/restaurant the other night\" one. In this scenario, the guys typical look for an all-inclusive bracelet. They seem to have most of them memorized so don't be fooled into believing them just because they know your hotel. They typically tell you that they were your waiter a few nights ago and that today is their day off so they're helping out in their uncle's store. They play on the fact that many people will feel guilty about not remembering the guy (but of course you don't remember since he never was your waiter lol) and this guilt trip works a stunning % of times that I have seen. They have also expanded it to include non-resort restaurants but this doesn't work nearly as often since by default, they have to speak in much more general terms, meaning more people catch onto the scam. Bottom line is, just be aware of it and buy something only if you want it, not because you are falsely guilted into it.The other main type of businesses (other than restaurants of course) are Spas. Most of these are massage only, but a few (like Magic Moments Spa near Constituyentes) also offer pedicure and manicure. These services are very cheap compared to prices in the USA at least. Most of them offer 1 hour massages for between $20-$30, which is well below the average of $50-$100 in the US. The big problem now though is that there are so many of these places (probably over 20 now just on the main part of 5th). This is not necessarily bad for tourists but it's bad for the girls (and some guys) who work there because they do not get paid anything unless they actually give a massage. A good portion of these places are also now using girls with no technical training. I have visited most of these places and the general rule of thumb is this... the farther north you go on 5th, the better your chances of getting a really good massage are. Some places that I know require all of their girls to be certified are: Magic Moments Spa (5th & Const - Aura is the best but all the girls are good. this is probably the best place currently in Playa), Magic Hands (2 locations: between 6th and 8th & between 10th & 12th). Also, Sabai, Zen & Be are good quality, but management here is poor towards employees.5th also has a distinctly different vibe between day and night, so both are recommended (I personally prefer night). For the most part, day activity is higher from Constituyents south and that mostly dies down by around 9pm. The night vibe kicks in usually after sundown from 10th/12th northwards, so this is a good time to explore the area north of Const, which includes a ton of new trendy restaurants.Overall, it's a really great experience, especially if you are into shopping, eating, or people watching."

This street was far longer than we thought it would be,as the first time we went, we walked to Calle 26(The Calle's cross the Avenues) which took well over half an hour. The Avenues numbers go up in 5's, so there is 5th Avenue, then 10th Avenue, then 15th. We Later found out that the Calle's go up to 38, so we hadn't reached the top as we thought.There is every kind of shop on 5th Avenue. There are the usual souvenir shops which are nearly all the same except the prices vary slightly. There are some great bars and restaurants, a few of them have live music, be it traditional or rock/pop. If you like rock/pop there is Kitxen which is 3/4 of the way up on the right and Hotel Siesta Fiesta, also known as Fah on the left about half way up. If you turn down one of the streets on the right, I can't remember which one, there is the Wah Wah bar, which has the best live music in town. It has music during some of the days and on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. The bands were brilliant and very,very talented.There are some fabulous clothes shops and also handbag and shoe shops (various price ranges) There are lots and lots of jewellers, most of which sell beautiful silver items. If you get a taxi, there are three prices, depending on whether you wish to be at the top, middle or bottom. The first stop was never more than 90 pesos, the others varied between 100 - 140 pesos.If you cut down some of the Calle's the are more local bars which have good vibes about them. If you are a churchgoer there is a lovely small white church on the right which does 4 masses on a Sunday - 10.00 12.00. 17.00. 19.00.My husband and I had some really good nights in the 5th Avenue area. Even if you are All Inclusive don't go home without visiting it."

A few gems in the mix, but mostly kitschy type items. They do offer a Starbucks & a few eateries along the way. However, the coolest part is having coconut water right from the coconut and watching a guy cut it open right in front of you-highlight of the Avenue! Take a stroll down by the beach and watch fisherman cut up th catch of the day or hop on a ferry to Cozumel-the action down by the beach is much more authentic! Also, there is a fashion mall located across 5th Avenue similar to those you'd see in the states. I feel that the airport had fun gifts to suit anyone-a few quaint shops with jewelry, t-shirts and unique gifts at reasonable prices and good quality!"

You can walk up and down the street and pop into which ever appeals to you. The crowds from bars sometimes spills out into the streets since open containers are no big deal here.

While humorous & fascinating at times, if you are tired or going from point A to point B, or trying to browse peacefully, it's definitely not happening! Some lines from vendors were pretty funny and a bit more original but mostly just repetitive & exhausting. Even training your gaze straight ahead is minimally successful & at times left me wanting to scream \"leave me alone!\" If you are foolish enough to actually look at something you leave yourself open to being hounded as you walk down the street. We Canadians are used to acknowledging people who address us, but we quickly learned to simply keep walking. There are occasional shops with something a bit different but it's an adventure just finding them & you are never free to enjoy browsing the street-side offerings. Many countries we've been to use similar vendor tactics as this but never have I seen so much of this squashed into one place where you must 'run the gauntlet' every time. Also, I have to ask, \"why travel to a different country, only to shop in stores exactly like the ones at home?\" because there were plenty of those too. The one bright spot was that it is an amazingly tolerant and unbiased place that seems to welcome everyone regardless of culture, ethnicity, lifestyle, etc. For that alone, it should be applauded."

The mile long pedestrian walkway is now expanding even further north!

Don't be afraid to interact with the locals tempting you into their store - they are harmless and fun! My all time favorite is 2-4-1 cocktail place is Bip Bip (5th and Constituyentes)- great local dishes, soups and pizza. Sit at the bar and tell them Holly sent you and look for my picture! Also, there are many fun and good eateries on all the other side streets - step out of your comfort zone and try something new! For those who haven't visited Playa del Carmen in awhile there have been some changes - a new Americanized type mall went up a few years ago and Calle Corazon has changed completely. These changes have diminished the quaint sleepy little fishing town that Playa has been known for, but don't let that prevent you from returning or going for the first time! Playa del Carmen is still a jewel in the Mayan Riviera!"

Asking if my husband wants to spoil me with jewelry, asking if we want Cuban cigars or weed. One day we were walking along and a guy walked up to us and said, \"hi! I'm Jose your waiter from last night. Do you remember me?\" I picked up on this scam quickly but my husband said \"yes.\" The guy said, \"I'm at my mother's shop here come in and take a look.\" I said no. We walked maybe 20 feet and another guy said the SAME thing to us. Beware! They talk so loud to you and follow you. It's sometimes hard to have a conversation walking down the street. And they won't take no for an answer. Then sometimes will make nasty remarks after you walk by. After a week of this it got old and I got so tired of it. I was on vacation. I just wanted to walk down the street in peace and have an uninterrupted conversation with my husband. I would definitely not recommend staying on Quinta Avenida because when you walk out your hotel door you're confronted with it immediately. There are some nice shops along the way but for me all of the other shop owners made it frustrating to walk down the street."

Some of the shops will bargain with you and others stick to their posted prices; generally if the prices are posted they are less likely to bargain. There are also a few upscale stores such as Hugo Boss, Swarovski, and Victoria's Secret some of which are in very modern three story mall type building. The restaurants range from taco shops to some nice Mexican style food and obviously sea food being only a block from the beach. There's even a Krispy Kreme at the south end.The vendors are generally friendly and upbeat and there spiels range from \"Come in, we have the cheapest prices\" to Come on in and let me rip you off.\" True, that was one of the pitches we heard.All in all a typical shopping area you might find in any Mexican tourist area. Or for that matter in Jamaica, Bali, even some European cities."

So be prepared for lots and lots of walking! Unfortunately, we didn't find much in the way of good food and service at most restaurants. The best food was off the beaten path, off of 5th Avenue on the side streets going into the old town. I would suggest exploring those streets instead for authentic food that's cheaper priced and so much more flavorful.And after almost a week walking 5th Avenue, we were exhausted from the constant \"harrassment\" from the shop owners to get us to buy something. It's very wearing and starts to get on your nerves after awhile. A good place to relax is in the Plaza where you can watch Mayan shows going on nearly night and day but expect them to walk around with a hat looking for tips."

If you are looking for a deal get a little further away on a back street as the further from 5th you are the better the prices.

Shop keepers can be pushy verbally so be prepared to ignore them. Wish they had more street food vendors-they only had dessert ones. Bartering ok on street purchases but not on store items. Beach is 1 block away. ATM's conveniently located. Parking lot not too hard to find. You'll pay for this but it is inexpensive."

It used to be small mom-n-pop store on top of each other - now it is all commercial - Diamond International, H&M, Aeropostale, and other \"chain\" places. The charm is gone!!!! There are a few mom-n-pop places, and they are worth the trip, but the whole street is now just one chain on top of the next. Playamart is still the place to check out - but their deals are not the same anymore!"

It's one of the reasons we stay in Playacar, the fact that we can walk to 5th in the evening and go for a drink or just people watch is a bonus to our vacation. However, we have noticed over the last 2 years that 5th avenue is slowly loosing it's charm to ultra modern high end boutiques that sprout high fashion shops that we have at home. Why would I shop at Zaxe in Mexico when I have one 5 minutes from home. I go on vacation to see something different and 5th is slowly loosing it."

It is amazing how much this area has changed and became loud and crowded. It used to be enjoyable to wander around the street and visit the shops before heading to the beach. Maybe it is because I have gotten older, but I found it too commercialized and people everywhere trying to sell all the same things for prices that seemed unreasonable. After finding this disappointing, we headed to the beach and found it to be crowded and not in the best shape. Likely damaged in a past storm. We were eager to leave Playa Del Carmen this time as any remaining charm appears to be gone."

There are the everyday shops, chains (Starbucks, Senior Frog), and unique (handmade clothing from native Aztecs). There were also kiosks mostly offering tours. We usually avid them as they usually are timeshare sale. This time we were curious and stopped to chat with a saleswoman. Told her we were interested in snorkeling and she offered a couple of suggestions. After negotiating, we did in fact, buy a tour. That turned out to be the best tour for our stay! At the end of the street is the ferry that will take you to Cozumel. And we took advantage of that on another day. Near the ferry port there were some street performers showing Mayan or Aztec cultural dances. On the day that we returned from Cozumel, we stayed latter in the evening and there were several other street performers. Yes, this is a tourist trap and yes it is very noisy. But it made for a fun day. And we did find a nice restaurant, Micaela's for a filling snack. Their Stone Bowl appetizer was enough for our dinner!

South of Avenida Constituyentes, the shops & restaurants range from still some local flavor to very pushy (it is Mexico) and now very upscale like a top end mall in any large cosmopolitan city. In fact, there is a new mall open now that was being built several years ago that is full of upper end stores that I feel really hurts the quaintness of the place that used to exist. We don't like that change, and the influx of cruise ships has likely caused a lot of it, but regardless, the experience of walking up & down the pedestrian street is still fun.

It can get crowded later in the day and at night. The cross streets are easily laid out allowing you to navigate the several mile area with ease. Dont forget the there is a beautiful beach just a couple of.blocks away. There are also lots of fun shops and restuarants within a few blocks of either side of fifh avenue. This is a pedestrian only avenue, so wear comfortable shoes. Cabs are easy to find up and down the area. I would set aside either a half day or at least an evening to get a good feel for the area. This is worth the stop."

I've been going to Playa Del Carmen for 25+ years and now attempt to walk down 1st or 10th. avenues. to get around town. The food is over priced and by no means the best of this city's culinary scene.. The street hustling is now untenable.Watch your pockets when approached by someone saying they're your \"waiter\"!! The cab drivers charge you double or triple the tarrif if you catch a cab along 5th and, a good majority of the \"massage girls\" are hookers nowadays. Note, the further south you go, the seedier the experience will be. If you want a good massage, pay a little more and go to Veronica's on 1st. Even just 10 years ago, 5th Ave was quaint but now, it's just the three mile long loved child from the sordid tryst between a middle class America shopping mall and a bad Mexican mercado. Neither are typically considered quaint or charming."

We stayed in Akumal because we like areas that are less touristy but we stopped into Playa del Carmen on our last day on our way to the airport to catch our evening flight. We walked down Quinta Avenida and honestly got very tired of saying no to people! There are lots of shops and everyone wants you to go into their shop. We had no interest in shopping and found it very tiring to be constantly bombarded by shop owners and people trying to sell us tours and tickets. Our sons remarked many times how happy they were that we didn't stay in Playa del Carmen. It is also a bit difficult to find parking which is quite expensive. All of the restaurants we looked at were easily 3 to 4 times the price of the restaurants in Akumal and Tulum!"

Every year for the past 15 years we have noticed the growth and progress and IMO it has lost it's charm. Gone are the cute palapa roofs with restaurants, shops and bars. Now replaced by Americanized chain stores and malls that are all overpriced.  The atmosphere used to be charming and it was very enjoyable to stroll both during the day and at night and take it all in. Stopping along the way to relax on the benches that were provided and listen to the strolling Mariachi bands and local musicians that were playing live. Now gone are the benches and there is only one group of Mariachi bands that will only play for a tip. There is no more strolling on 5th ave, the pace is so hectic and crazy and so many people. The only places now to sit and relax are the high end Starbucks and other coffee or bars along the avenue and even then you can't hear yourself think because of the loud music pumping out of the bars on the corner of 5th and calle 10. I looked forward to the evening strolls along the avenue to people watch but now avoid it like the plague......Lost is the\" local\" feel, like the fruit ladies and the food stands, now more designer stores and high end boutiques are what you will see."

Tons of unique shops, great people watching, great restaurants and bars. I wouldn't recommend buying jewelry at the shops on Quinta though, as it's not always authentic. For example, shop workers will tell you that the opal jewelry is \"Mexican/harvested in Mexico,\" but most of it is man-made from plastic (though it looks real) and it's NOT a bargain. There is however a lot of local art for sale, which is a good deal if it is authentic. Some of it is, some of it is made in China, you just have to research it a bit before you buy and don't be afraid to haggle over prices; they seem to expect it and don't mind \"negotiating.\" I recommend just walking this street to take in all of the wonderful Playa/Mexican culture; it's a great experience! Just don't let yourself be bothered by heckling shop workers; it's just part of the tourist-oriented culture and they are fun to talk with if you have an easy going attitude/don't take it personally. I've found that the locals are friendly, fun people and this street is a safe, great place to interact with just about anyone. Of course, watch your purse, backpack, etc., just like you would in any tourist-oriented location, but really, I feel safer in Playa than I've felt in many other tourist locales, such as Paris or Rome."

However, during the day this commercial strip is too North American and definitely too high priced to be enjoyable. Street vendors constantly accost all passersby, frequently offering prices that are \"almost free\" and \"Cheaper than Walmart\" and if that fails to interest the pitch frequently ends with \"Wanna get high?\" This contrasts with retail establishments and restaurants, many with names familiar to Americans and Canadians from home, offering prices that are inflated by North American standards and exorbitant by Mexican standards. It's worth a visit for a few hours and to stop a one of the more local restaurants which are often on side streets just to experience but over-priced and uncomfortable for a leisurely visit to town by a vacationer."

You can get great access to off-the-beaten path to sandy beaches for fun in the sun. Adult visits at night is great for night life partying and exploring authentic Mexican tasty food delights. Be careful to travel using the buddy system as one or two streets off the beat can be dangerous day or night. Otherwise, have fun and take plenty of pictures."

People will ask you to come in their shops give you tequila samples and such but in my opinion the best prices were at La Europea in the Quinta Alegria Mall. The bottles in the tourist shops were marked up quiet a bit. But for little nick nacks and that, those shops are fine. Most of the stuff is made in China now anyway. There is the odd sketchy person asking 'weed/blow', but a simple head shake and no and its no problem. I was also there during BPM festival (not attending it) so that may have had something to do with that.It's really close to the beach (1 block up) so bring your swimsuit if you fancy a swim!"

I caution people though as the store owners/salesmen are aggressive and will use your resort bracelet as a sales pitch. They try to pretend they work in your resort as waiters, ground staff etc but they don't. They know all the various resort bracelets and try play on that. They will try charge you double but if you know your prices or how to barter them you should be fine. Keep your money close as I have heard of handsy salesmen or their companions helping themselves to your cash. I love the massive variety of stores and shops and the busy atmosphere. It's definitely not something we see often at home. I recommend checking it out, simply for the experience is nothing else. The beach here is also amazing if you decide to bring your suit and towel.

You literally can't walk 10 feet without someone trying to sell you... hair braiding... massages... junky and wildly overpriced trinkets... and - worst of all - tours and activities from the ubiquitous kiosks. These kiosks are the worst - they're populated with pushy sales people who will lie to you at every opportunity - promising tours and experiences that sound great - until you actually get there and find out you've been sold a \"tour\" that doesn't deliver nearly what was promised. At least at the price you've paid. And getting your money back from these thieves requires the Tourist Police - if you're lucky. My advice is to get tours through the larger hotels - you may (or may not) pay a bit more, but these hotels have leverage that a lone traveler simply doesn't - and crooks are less likely to scam people coming through a major hotel because they don't want to get blacklisted. Just walk past the kiosks and save yourself some grief."

We ended up paying $25US for full braids with beads at a street corner cart - way better than the $60+US we were first offered. I also went to the nearest small convenience store to buy beer for about $1US while we waited. As others have noted, if you want deals, travel up and down the side streets a bit rather than just staying on the main drag.

It was a lot different from when we were there in 5/2006. It is a must if you visit Playa Del Carmen, Riviera Maya, Playa Pariso,MX. Since we were there before and after Christmas it was extremely crowded with International Tourists. Quinta Avenida, a Pedestrian area, is in downtown Play Del Carmen and is a very long street with shops, restaurants, farmacias, a Western Shopping Mall with Designer brands, Bars and Night Clubs. The Night Clubs open at 11pm and Street Vendors have packages for Coco Bongos etc.We shopped during the day for Souveniors and possible Excursions to participate in. We went inside a Jewelry Store and we looked at various stones and necklaces. We do not think the silver is real Sterling Silver it was too light and shiny. We couldn't find the stamp of 925 for Sterling silver. We looked at Gold necklaces and bracelets were not stamped with a number of real quality gold. It was difficult to tell if the stones were natural or man-made. Most of the Vendors and store Sales people speak English and most speak Spanish. Beware,the Store Sales people will say \"Remember me, I'm the waiter at the restaurant at your resort\" to try to get you into their store because they know the Resort wrist bands. The store Sales people say \"Almost Free\", which made me laugh I said \"No Gracias\" to 20 people and kept walking. You see some Mexican culture and International culture. There are Street performers to watch."

Our latest trip was in the beginning of this month, December.Over the past year or so, 5th Avenue has become way too commercialized, thereby pushing the small local store owners out of the area due to rents being so high. We know many of the shop owners and, unfortunately, they had to close their stores due to the higher rents. There are very upscale stores there now including a full-blown mall to include Forever 21 and even Michael Kors. Starbucks is even there now.Please, don't get me wrong, we still enjoy going to 5th but seeing all the new development is truly a turn off. We will always walk 5th but not as often."

We lived in Playa for 18 days and EVERY time we walked up and down the street we got contacted in average around 20 times each way. Normally you can ignore them or just say \"no thank you\" but there are a few of them who went way to far, calling us names when we didn't react, yelling at us for not responding and being really rude. The first times you get asked if you want a massage or if you want to look in a store, it's no problem being kind and say no. But the 20th time in 10 minutes you get asked, you don't want to respond anymore. It's exhausting. It's also very hard to have a conversation with your partner, as you are constantly interrupted by these salesmen. The worst part however, are the drug dealers. We get contacted 3-4 times each way from Calle 2 to Calle 20... Weed, cocaine, wanna get high, wanna wake up... The same people are asking you over and over again... A no is usually enough, but we've been followed, yelled after, called different nasty things. If at least the drug deals would leave us alone it would have been bearable, but after 18 days with the same crap, you get really annoyed in the end and it ruins the great experience that it could have been."

The crowds are less, the shops and restaurants are nicer, but mostly I prefer it because the shop attendants do not try to badger and con you into their stores. The first day in Playa we made the mistake of taking 5th Ave from Calle 26 to Calle 16. There was constant harassment from store workers, even very bad cons. It was not fun. The next day we turned the different direction on the street (from calle 26 to 38) and it was a different story. No cons, no harassment. Lots of small restaurants and shops. We even did some decent tourist shopping without being badgered. The other end of 5th Avenida should learn a lesson from this. We may be tourists but we are not stupid. (BTW, if a store keeper stops you in the street and says, \"Hey, it's so good to see you!! I'm the waiter from your resort, remember? I'm Roberto! So good to see you again!\" just flip him off. What a stupid con."

Walking down the street a lot of store workers will try and do everything they can to get you inside the stores. Another negative, you have to be careful with the really small shops- they follow you around pushing you to buy items, and then offer services and claim the price doesn't change but then when you're checking it out it does (and they don't give you a receipt). I learned my lesson real quick and decided to stick to the larger souvenir shops!"

If I even looked at an item, I was being somewhat berated with \"why not buy?\" I did buy some souvenirs but leaned towards the shops where people were more polite and subtle. It did look to have several beautiful restaurants and even big, modern mall. If I was there with my sister or girlfriends, I could have easily spent longer there...

Unless you don't mind spending 3x the price for the same jewelry just around the corner, shop around. The rest of the vendors aren't going to pack up and leave in a mysterious hurry and neither will your money if you're patient.2. The man in front of the shop yelling at you \"Remember me? I was your bartender at xxx resort last night.\" He was not your bartender. Ever. Trust me on this. Sure, you'll feel bad that you don't recognize him - but he recognized the resort bracelet your wearing. You've never seen that man in your life. I swear.3. Don't drink the free tequila in the back of the jewelry store. Even if it's the almond flavored one and the most delicious thing you've ever tasted. Don't do it. When is the last time you made a good decision while drinking tequila? Never. And you know it.4. Unless you are looking for a few good blank c.d.'s without the music you think you are purchasing on it, don't buy any from the sweet young lady selling them at her booth. I've never heard such a quiet Mariachi band. Ever. Nobody has. 5. Unless you are looking to make a donation to a charity of the shop owners choosing, I wouldn't use a credit card for purchases. Chances are that shop owner is the charity. Chances are that I was that stupid. Chances are that I got ripped off. Chances are that I went back to ask about it. Chances are the guy got right in my face and yelled something about the exchange rate somehow changing in the pesos favor at the exact minute I made the purchase. Chances are I left quickly. Chances are....you shouldn't take the chance. That is all. Just don't. 6. Was it fun? Sure. If you don't mind being a sucker, re-meeting every bartender from every bar you've ever been to, drinking tequila likely made in someone's bathroom (although....I must say it's delicious and depending on your stomach strength and immunizations, worth the risk), and having stories to tell your friends. I'd go again. For reals. Only I'd leave my credit card at home, stop feeling guilty about not recognizing someone I've never met, I'd still drink the tequila and enjoy the walk."

It's a scam to make you feel like he's this great guy who is personal enough to remember you and invite you into his \"mom's\" store...(he is just working there on his one day off). Then, he'll give you this great deal, but \"you better remember him and tip him well when he serves you at the hotel the next day.\" Whatever...don't buy jewelry in Mexico.

It is basically a huge market with items that appear to be \"local\" but are actually made in China :D Loads of people will bother you with \"hey guys, check the store, almost free...\" and other pick lines... Be cautious though. One example speaks for all. I was searching for some bracelet made of blue stones that are Yucatan's typical jewelery. Saw one on the table in front of the shop. Asked what the price was (as there were no price tags). The seller took me to the shop, showed me other stuff and said that the price was usually 700 MXN, but just for me it is only 675 MXN. I said I did not have that much money on me and that I might come back for it later on. As I was leaving the store, he offered me gradually price of 400 MXN, 300 MXN, and when I was outside, he said that if I really liked it, he could give it to me for 200 MXN. What a scam.... If you do wish to purchase items here, on Avenida 5th, DO NOT accept the price they say as the first one. Pretend to leave, see what you can negotiate. And generally, just don't go for the items without the price tags. As far as the restaurants go, the prices there are aproximately 3 times higher than in usual restaurants, a bit further from the sea, but that's kinda expected."

This pedestrian only street is lined with shops and restaurants - some local and some large American chains. Be prepared to be bombarded by shopkeepers trying to persuade you into their store. Most are polite about it, but some not so much. We found that a simple no gracias worked fine most of the time, as long as you kept moving. I didn't end up buying anything and my husband wasn't too impressed with being offered drugs and women by a few men lining the street. I'd skip this area and check out the streets further east, away from the beach."

You just have to politely say no thanks and keep it moving. I never felt in danger or threatened walking fifth avenue alone. While most shops are bulk generic souvenir joints there are jems hidden in between like the corazon shop which sells handmade treasures. Further down the road you will find less outdoor vendors and more mid to high end shops. I actually went back a second time!

The first time we went a lot of people kept asking us if we remembered them because \"I was your waiter at (insert resort name here) last night. Once they couldn't read the bracelet, this nearly eliminated the harassment. Then it was a lovely stroll down the avenue. We shopped mostly at the large stores, where we discovered that the prices for most items were only slightly less than our resort gift shop, but it was fun and there is some beautiful Mexican artisanship"

Always a thrill to spend the day on 5th avenue, although going at night presents a totally different view as the sun sets the lights go on and it takes on a different persona ! The \"hawking\" is still the same ie: lady, come into my shop and let me rip you off\" or \" we are cheaper than walmart\" !! can be lots of fun .You can walk as far as you want, probably 4 miles long. We try to get to Constitution Avenue but that's a long way. LaParilla, one of our favorite restaurants moved down there so maybe worth the taxi ride there and walk as far back as you can until you want to get a taxi back to your hotel! The new mall ( a couple years old now) is right there too, (bathrooms up the escalator) gorgeous mall but I think all the improvements, like the NEW upscale stores sort of ruin the downtown flavor of old Playa, which I liked better. but there must be money being spent there."

Great for us Brits as we don't have many of the U.S. Stores like Victoria's Secret, sephora and forever 21 at home. The Michael Kors store was cheaper than in England. Yes, the owners of the touristy type shops try and encourage you to come in but just saying 'no thanks' they didn't pursue you. Some of them were actually quite funny! Make sure you go down the side streets and the road that runs parallel too, we found nicer bars and restaurants than the ones on the Main Street. Id recommend El Tapas and Company - 2 streets back. Drinks were very cheap in all 3 bars we tried and they all had good wifi. This is a good trip for a half day or half day plus time for a meal, when you're up for a change of scenery from the hotel. You can get a taxi at a lot of places along the road and ask the price back to your hotel before you get in if you're worried. We got a cab for $25 back from here to the Valentin hotel to give you an idea of fare, it was $30 from the hotel to here!"

If they would at least stay within their shops and wait to see if there is any interest in their wares, it wouldn't be so bad. But they come out into the street, cut you off, shake your hand (whether you like it or not), and basically ruin the experience. We went through this a few years ago, and it didn't seem so bad then, but it is a trying experience that may put a black mark on your vacation. There is a lot of merchandise to see, but the prices are, for the most part, not competitive. We will skip this attraction the next time around."

It can be very difficult to just browse through some shops as some of the shop keepers can be very pushy and aggressive.

Beware they try to tell you that they work in your hotel to engage you in conversation and act like they are terribly offended when you say you are not interested in an item you have been looking at. Only ask prices of stall or small shops if you are really interested. It is hard to shop around. I understand they really need the business but it doesn't hurt to be polite. We have travelled in Asia and have never had this sort of pressure to buy.We bought a lot of silver, pottery, t-shirts etc. Can't say they were huge bargains but we liked what we bought and it is definitely an interesting experience."

If they would just back off a little, I bet they would be able to sell a lot more. If you keep walking and don't make eye contact with them it's not so bad, but once you give them interest they fly over you like vultures. I brought a small cooler from home, and filled it with water from the resort I was staying on. I'm happy I did because it does get hot, and water can be a few bucks more then in the US.

The people that yell at you saying they were your waiters at the resort last night or whatever... just ignore and walk right past them. They were not your waiter last night. Fat Tuesday is an awesome time, we did pay to get our picture on the overpriced bottle of tequila. Make sure to try the eye candy drink! Senor frogs was good too, but the food wasn't that great. Cabs are cheap, and generally, everyone is nice. I got my hair braided (just one strand) and it has stayed over a month! Try to bargain all you can if you go, the lady was trying to charge me $12 USD for a hair braid, but after walking away she yelled and asked if I could do $5. I took her up on that, and had her add in a gold temporary tattoo for $3USD. Don't do the tattoos, they will rub off immediately in the beach."

There are some comedians amongst the stall holders and you her some funny lines trying to get you into their shops. We loved the atmosphere and bought a lot of t shirts and jewellery, sunglasses and beach shoes. They sell everything you could want here and the shops range from traditional mayan art shops to Malls with Forever 21, American Eagle etc.There is a lot of bartering to be done if you purchase from the stalls and I found I would decide what I was prepared to pay and then bartered down. I bought some necklaces with Abalone pendants and they started at 30 dollars each and I got the two for \u00a320. Still don't know if this was the right price but it was what I was happy to pay.Off 5th Avenue are lots of more local shops selling goods at cheaper prices including sunglasses, shoes, jewellery etc and local food carts. There is also a huge Walmart which is air conditioned and great to walk into on a boiling hot day. We got bottles of Appleton Jamaica rum for \u00a34 and Captain Morgan for just under \u00a36 here, which was cheaper than the airport.For a wonderful taste of electric atmosphere and fun I would recommend Fifth Avenue"

We had lunch in a Mexican restaurant which was lovely, had couple of coffee stops and dinner in an Argentinian restaurant. All great and very good price. One of our coffee stops was at Au Cocolate, where we bought some 100% and 70% dark chocolate to bring home. Yes you will get asked constantly to come into shops at one point it was like walking through a gauntlet of traders. But we just said hola, no thanks and laughed at some of their comments.Some nice designer shops, covered malls, bars and restaurants along the avenue along with lots tacky souvenir shops, however some have lots of good stuff in them to take back for family and kids etc.Due to the rain we didn't see the street acts at the far but we are going to go back one evening again for dinner so hoping to catch that experience then.Walk to Walmart was experience through some local shops and markets but good to see. Felt safe and with the streets being a square grid pattern, you can't really get lost, but take a map anyway. We took a taxi from Walmart back to 5th Avenue due to being shattered and carrying a few bags of bargains we picked up in the store. (\u00a36 for a bottle of Kraken Spiced rum).Take money as you will spend it. Wear good walking comfy shoes/trainers. Take a sense of humour. Expect to be hassled but not physically. Try your best at haggling as you will get things cheaper (although I was told off by my partner for even suggesting to haggle in the Swaroski shop). Look out for the silver and leather shops for genuine goods and savings. If you are just not satisfied with everything going on, then you can even get a McDonald's to remind you of home!For a short trip in a taxi or bus (from our hotel it was $5) it is well worth doing on one or two of your days here."

Vendors like to holler at everyone walking along the streets and they can be quite aggressive, just be pleasant and ignore them. I say only 1 visit to this avenue is necessary as there are a whole lot more enjoyable, local places to see and better food to eat elsewhere."

Walking from playacar or right out of our resort at The Royal we love taking the walk. 5th ave has it all amazing food great little shops and plenty of beautiful boutique hotels to look at. If your resort is close to this location it is well worth at least taking a half day visit to check it out. So much culture so much fun so laid back. Great place to get a good deal on excursions as well. Enjoy"

If you stay at an all inclusive resort, wear a bracelet or a watch over your wrist band as the vendors know the colours of the bands and some will say that they were your waiter from the other night. Then when you look all confused that gives them the opening to start talking and trying to herd you towards where they want to sell you something. We were smart though, we caught the vendor out on his lie because at the resorts the men must be clean shaven, no beards or goatees and this guy had a small beard. Still fun to look and walk around and have a meal at a restaurant."

There are just a few things to remember:1. Not everything is a good deal. In fact, some things are downright overpriced. It's hard to find good deals right on Fifth Avenue itself. Your better buys are often a block or so off the main drag.2. It's Mexico. That means you need to barter for goods. NEVER take the marked price as the final price. Make an offer that you want to pay. If the business owner doesn't want the offer, walk away.3. Everybody wants you to stop in his/her shop. If you aren't interested, just keep walking.4. Don't wear shirts with sayings on them. If you wear that Nebraska Husker t-shirt so you can run into more people from Omaha, be prepared to have every person in every shop yell, \"Hey, Husker. Come over here, Hooosker!\"5. Go, walk and have a good time. There are many fun stores, bars and restaurants. There's also pretty much a Haagen-Dasz on every corner."

Great for couples and solo. 5th ave is great with nice little shops and authentic Mexican culture. Its a nice strip to walk on from when sun goes up till when it goes down. The liveliness starts at night and lots of people come out. Friendly vacationers and lots of nice locals. It's pretty safe since there's police everywhere. You may even find a nice restaurant to fall in love with. But be careful with some restaurants because some will leave you with heartburn and empty pockets. There's a lot of restaurants we didn't get a chance to check out. We mainly preferred theme restaurants or organic Mexican food.. Some great restaurants are hidden on side streets so don't be afraid to explore. Bike rentals are a must try. Car rentals and taxis are everywhere. Cons: There's hagglers EVERYWHERE!! I don't know how many times I heard \"Take a look my friend\" \"Nice silver for you\" \"check it out\" Special deal\" \"Do you want to have fun.. cocaine, weed\" \"Massage\" \"TAXI\"!! Yikes!! oh my gosh.. annoyed beyond words at times and it never stops.. especially those mornings you wake up on the wrong side of the bed.. They don't care!! at least 15 hustlers is guarantee to convince you to buy something within a two block radius. When you say no thank you, some get hugely disappointed .. some usually talk about you to their peers in Spanish. Some smile and say no problem.. But understand most Mexican men are silly with a burst of personality. Try not to take things too personal and understand that's their hustle. Once you overcome the harassment and know what to expect the experience gets better.Also everything shuts down at a certain time. Trying to find food on a hungry stomach after the club lets out is nearly non existent ...unless you really know where to go.. I walked for blocks and found nothing!! I thought it would've been a 24 hour area. Guess my expectations were too high. Overall me and my husband will return in the near future. I just want to share some personal tips I learned but to each it's own.. 5th ave is great for maybe a day or two to explore then go back to your all-inclusive resort. The hotels around 5th ave are nice and small but I'm not sure if these smaller hotels offer all inclusive. It's a headache digging in your pockets trying to figure out pesos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I highly suggest converting your money as well. We kept our American money but were robbed a lot and it adds up. Next time we will book an all-inclusive and just get a car rental to go to 5th avenue. I don't need to stay in the area. Some mornings and afternoons are dead. I notice the area doesn't pick up till about 4:00 p.m"

It is blocked off for pedestrians although cars cross it at the intersections. In every block you will find Tshirt and gift shops, restaurants, small convenience stores, and handcraft shops. Every few blocks you will find jewelry stores, an art gallery or fine clothing boutique. Also massage, pedicure and other personal services. Now there are two major malls as well, including high-end chains as in every other major city. It is easy to use this corridor for all your dining and shopping. Watch for the time share and tourist operators, as they can get your attention and monopolize your time easily; also the scams by guys (and gals) who introduce themselves as \"your waiter from the hotel\" and offer to show you their friend's (or family's) shop or restaurant. If you stop to talk to everyone, you will never get to dinner! When you are finished, you can easily catch a taxi to go home, but verify the fare with the driver before you get in."

There is Part 1 and Part 2 to the Avenida, and you may begin at either end. Part I begins near the pier to Cozumel and has lots of American franchaises, such as Starbucks, Haagan Daaz, Sephora, Forever 21, and soon to be a 3 story H&M super store. Part 2 has more of a Mexican feel to it. Pretty much, the same merchandise can be found throughout the entire avenida. There is no bargaining at the Fiesta Market which is a chain store with at least 3 to 4 locations. You can find a nice selection of souvenirs, Mexican vanilla essense and tequilla there. Expect to pay a hefty sum for sunscreen which runs at USD$24.00 each at the local pharmacies. Find good bargaining at the mom and pop stores, and off the beaten paths. Bring cash in either USD or pesos. They want to see your money when making a deal, although you can ignore their request. Dress comfortably as it gets really hot in the summer. Plan on at least 3 hours minimum to get through the entire street. The local Tour kiosks have very competitive prices. There are also Taxi kiosks in between Part 1 and 2 for your convenience. The shopkeepers are bargain experts and are not easily swayed. Some vendors will call out to get your attention esp. the Tour Vendors, but most vendors will not harrass you. Whether you are in the mood for shopping or not, it is still a nice stroll."

The music at the most large clubs is way too commercial but I guess that's what works for them. Some exceptions like Diablito make it worthwhile to go out and listen to good music. And for fine dining in a fun atmosphere, go one block from Fifth to PLANK (in front of Acanto Hotel & Suites) which is truly spectacular!Now, during the day it's a different story... the street is nice to walk under the sun and it's wonderful to sit outside at the restaurants and cafe-bars, or inside some that offer patio or garden sitting, like Aldea Coraz\u00f3n which I recommend for breakfast (early or late). You can grab a beer or margarita and keep walking, drink-in-hand of course!Quinta Avenida is enjoyable night or day, just make sure you know where to go and which places to stop by... Salud!"

The prices in almost every store, I've gone into were way overpriced. I read about the silver jewelry not being real silver. So far while in pdc, I've bought absolutely nothing. My rental is very near 5th Avenue and I deliberately walk on 10th just to avoid the catcalls, harassment and whistles. If I wanted to buy an item, or take a tour, im certainly not going to buy anything after being treated poorly and spoken to rudely. I'm also not going to buy overpriced trinkets in a tourist trap. Very disappointed!"

On 5th ave We had couples massages...deep tissue...was amazing. ..she even kneeled on the back of my legs while massaging! Way better and cheaper than the resorts!

It gets old and annoying very quickly, you will hear these statements for the whole stretch of the Avenue. I have learned from staff at the resort I stayed as he used to work on the Avenue that, as sellers they have to learn each bracelet on your hand and color coded because it tells level of possible spending. Nonetheless, there are some off beaten path shops that you can get a good stuff including food from. Tips:1. If you exchange money at the Avenue, avoid those that buying less than 15 pesos per USD (you buying pesos). They will put 16 on windows and those are for selling price (they selling USD back for your pesos). 2. You can use USD or your currency at street vendors, my experience the exchange rate is 10 pesos to 1 USD.3. Haggle to death.

The hustle and bustle of a \"Fremont Street - style Mexican Strip\" was non-existent. Gone are the days of free tequila shots at happy hour, barefoot walkup beach bars, $1 beers, and $2 burritos. Not that we didn't have fun...it's just that seeing a shopping mall with Victoria Secret and American Eagle Outfitters, kind of depressed me. I don't go to Mexico to shop for MAC make-up or $40 Havainas. I go there to get a little dirty, a lot sweaty, occasionally drunk, and just have an all- around laid back good time. Sadly, the only thing really \"dirty\" about Playa Del Carmen now, is the shoreline. 2 foot high mounds of dead-fish smelling, rotting seaweed made the ocean disgusting and not swimmable, from any beach. Even in front of Zenzi Beach Club!!--- which is supposedly one of the highest TripAdvisor rated beach clubs in PDC. Hey Zenzi...maybe you could use some of that $125 USD I spent on a bucket of beers and chips and salsa, to clean up your beachfront. Ugh.Anyways...If you like nature, being far away from the \"shopping\" crowd, and are looking for a spot in the Riviera Maya where you can just go and chill on a beach like a hippie...take the ferry to Cozumel, rent a scooter or car, and drive to the other side of the island. It's pretty desolate over there, on the opposite side from where the cruise ships come into port. If I had our recent trip to do over again, we would've just spent 9 days over there in Cozumel, and skipped PDC altogether. If I want all that glittery nonsense, I can just drive 30 min down the freeway from where I live, and go to the Las Vegas Strip. I guess it just all depends on what kind of vacation you are looking for. My husband and I like to rough it a bit on vacation. We're not the \"backpacker, stay-in-a-hostel type\"...but in the same breath, we don't necessarily need to stay anywhere fancy, just somewhere clean and hospitable. We hardly spend anytime in our room, and set out to seek either adventure, or somewhere to chill, every day. Finding a nightclub to wander into and dance the night away is fun to do on occasion, but I'm not big on staying at a hotel right next door to nonstop, pulse-pounding music either....which seems to be the norm no matter where you stay on 5th Avenue. We are in our mid thirties and early forties. I hope giving you a little description of us helps you to decide if this is the right kind of vacation for you, or not."

I am not writing this review because Quinta Avenida is unique.So, why am I writing this review?When I was planning our trip, I read reviews that made Quinta Avenida sound like Thunderdome. A horrible, dirty place with pushy street people chasing you everywhere. This WAS NOT what we experienced!As a result of these reviews, we decided not to visit. On a whim, we changed our minds and made a last-minute decision to do a little shopping. I'm glad we did. What we experienced was an enjoyable sunny afternoon with local folks in a pleasant seaside town. Right up front, Quinta Avenida is not really much different from any other mercado. Seen one, seen 'em all. Street stalls and small shops, all selling souvenirs, interspersed with bars, restaurants and high end retailers. Playa del Carmen is a pretty town, and the avenue is a tree-shaded, attractive pedestrian promenade in the heart of the tourist district. Prices are fair and the selection is not bad.Yes, you will be approached by peddlers, some more assertive than others, but all with a friendly attitude. You can banter with them and they will continue to engage you, but we never had anyone keep pushing if we gave them a firm \"No\". For instance, one guy approached me and tried to get me into his shop. I said, \"I'm good\". He replied, \"but you could be better...\" I laughed and said \"No thanks\" and he gave me a smile and a wave. We felt safe the entire time, and even found a few gifts for family and friends.I guess my point is that, if you go to another country, meet the people. It may be a little outside your comfort zone, but don't stay barricaded in your resort, afraid to experience the local culture. You're going to deprive yourself of those unique experiences that make foreign travel special."

( I believe it is closet one to the beach) The guy told me 15peso per hour. I confirmed with them many times, just in case we are going to be ripped off. Of course, the wrote the time as soon as we got in the parking gate before parking the car. ( that is okay) We came back after taking photos at the beach 10 mins before one hour. They didn't let us pay until we move the car from the parking lot. (that is okay too) We moved the car and tried to pay. They told me $50 instead of $15. I complained lots showing the sign at their shop. They asked me $5 more. I didn't understand the beginning. We paid $10 + $5 coins. During the conversation, they swap the coins to $5 + $5 coins. I saw how my husband paid. It was very obvious to say that, but they didn't have any shame. I know it is so cheap to ague. I think many people will give up for it. We knew many people trick in Mexico, I really wanted to fight for it as well as my husband. We really compline for a long time and asked for calling police. Finally let us go. We could pay for extra money since so so small, however all experiences are awful. I wanted to write here. If you are parking the place. You should video tape the conversation, and make sure how much you have to pay. When you pay, do not leave your eyes off from the money. Even you can pay money counting at loud. I can't find this parking address, but the parking is near the big bus stain (20 Av. Nte 77710 Playa del Carmen, Q.R.)"

In the evening, there would be people dressed up or painted to look like statues. There would be more little shows to watch and enjoy. My friend and I visited during the day, and on the advice of our hotel conseaire, went back in the evening. One thing we did enjoy was a pedicure where little fish ate the dead skin off of your feet. I had read about this in a spa magazine, so I was eager to try it. I will say that you can barter and try to get a good deal if you see something you really want to buy. In fact, you might even be chased somewhat to try and get you to buy their goods. A little hassling is okay, but I did tire of it quickly."

There is no peace. \"Gringo, spend money or go home\" is the reception you can expect. It was awful. And nothing to see or buy except the same crap in every shop. Absolutely nothing of interest. Buy some made in mexico trinket at your local Wal-Mart and you will have the same thing for less money. And we were robbed by the police at a traffic checkpoint. All the advice about what to do when the cops try to extort money is just jibberish when you are confronted by a sweaty cop with a machine gun on his shoulder telling you that you can not leave until you give him $50.00.

They have to pay the hotel a hefty commission. Just go outside of the hotel grounds and bargain with the driver. It cost us almost the same as taking the collectivo and the driver waited for us for a few hours while we went shopping. The shopping itself was nice. Do not buy for the price marked (unless the prices are fixed, which is clearly marked) and do not buy at the first store you see. This is the only thing that was annoying. The same sombrero cost 400 pesos in one store and 150 pesos in another. So, walk around first and BARGAIN. If you are buying silver, go to an actual jewelry store, as the ones on the street might be fake (advice of our tour guide). Even at the jewelry store, ask for 40% off right away. That seems to be the standard in all the stores we visited. If you are looking for genuine crafts, go to an art gallery store. Those usually have fixed prices but the pieces are absolutely beautiful. My favorite were the wood, carved, and beautifully painted, locally found animals, such as coatis, iguanas, etc. We also bought some hand made blankets and cotton pants and dresses all made in Mexico. For the not so genuine trinkets, there are hundreds of stores you can go to. And it is a good place to have your daughter's hair braided, if you have time. The prices are much better than at the hotel spas. Unfortunately, we did not have the time to wait and had to settle for the hotel spa. There are also tons of places to buy cigars, and we have seen so many as my husband and his friend are really into them. Again, bargain and see a few places before you buy. Ask which ones you can bring across the border if you are planning to bring them back. The people selling them will know. Our entire family is vegan and we could not find a single place to eat, unfortunately. All the restaurants seem to be stake and seafood and meat, meat, meat. And they push the kids menu (chicken fingers, fries, etc.). We do not eat any of that stuff. So, if you are into healthy eating you might want to eat before you go as there is not much there that's healthy.I heard that you can see pretty awful stuff on Quinta Avenida, like baby lions, which are obviously kept in captivity. We did not see any of that. If you do, do not take pictures as that only promotes exploitation of these poor animals."

The sales guys are annoying, and they will try to tell you that they work in whatever hotel you're staying, and that they are off today working in their family business. Don't buy it and enjoy the experience, but keep your wallet in your pocket."

            "review": "Absolutely the place to go while staying close to Playa del Carmen, a pedestrian only mile of shops, bars and food.. 5th Avenue or Quinta Avenida in Playa del Carmen is a destination by itself. One caveat--if you are there in the summertime, go late in the afternoon as the heat will make the visit memorable--but for the wrong reason. Four of us walked 5th avenue one afternoon and by the time we were at Constituents Avenue we were drenched in sweat. We had to sit under a tree with some cold refreshments for quite a while to cool down so we could walk back to the south end.5th Avenue is a pleasant destination free of vehicles for North American, European and Mexican tourists full of various shops, restaurants, bars and motels. For those that are concerned about safety--it is very safe and if you ever asked anyone who has been there you will get the same response. You read this correctly--it is pedestrian traffic only. And if you have a burning desire to go to WalMart while there, it is a short 4 block walk from 5th Avenue.In the late afternoon and early evening is the time to walk the avenue. They have strolling Mariachi bands for your enjoyment and the afternoon shade of the buildings makes for a pleasant walk. Many of the restaurants have eating available alongside the avenue at street-side tables. We stopped for beer and pizza one of those locations and enjoyed people watching while we ate.It is somewhat amazing to see what is in the shops. They have the normal shops that sell the t-shirts, hats, masks and ceramic items and they also have the jewelry shops. What is not expected is the high end shops that exist on the south end of 5th Avenue and those near Constituents Avenue (Avenida Constituyentes).Near the south end is the public beach and the ferry crossing to Cozumel. It is a very friendly place with a very diverse business structure. They only annoying issue is the same issue facing tourists in the Caribbean. When things are a little slow, the shop owners become a nuisance by trying to get you into their shop. Once you get past that issue--it is an enjoyable experience."

But where can you go, walk miles of cobblestone streets, with no cars to worry over, and everybody comes here to eat, laugh, shop a little, see and be seen, and just play with your family? This is it. Finally a real place, way too big to see one day off a cruise ship. Playa Del Carmen and Fifth Avenue are a special, family old Mexico place, away from the party Cancun scene. The reef is about 50'yards away from Fifth Avenue, and you can see it as you lounge around in an outdoor seating restaurant, with mariachi bands wandering by, playing. Really, believe me, if you like people and casual dining nights, this is the place to be. I cannot tell you how many times I have talked to shop owners there that have said, \"I came here to visit, and never left!\" I wish I didn't have to leave too!"

At least once, I had every intention of moving along until the seller made a discounted offer I couldn't refuse. (My kids love those hammocks!).

We continued our walk and were approached by a guy who 'recognized' us ... Just be aware that the sale guys on 5th avenue are very slick. They know the various hotel bracelets and will greet you as if they work at that hotel. They are usually pretending to be one of the bartenders or waiters from your specific hotel. All they want to do is to take you to one of 'their' relatives stores nearby and offer to give you the best price because you are staying at the hotel which they supposedly work at. The shop keepers give these guys a commission or percentage of whatever you purchase to bring you into the shop. They are not dangerous just can be a bit annoying. The guy who stopped us tried to sell us Cozumel magic stone earrings .. Started at 473.00 then went to 261.00 ... Then got down to 150.00 before we just told him that we were not interested. Anyway we continued walking and window shopping untill tropical storm bill decided to produce some very heavy rain. So we decided to get a taxi back to the hotel. On a personal note - If you decide to buy anything it might benefit you to change dollars into pesos because you get a better exchange rate 14.3 rather then some vendors calculating 10 pesos to the U.S. Dollar.

Lots of great ice cream and coffee places too (including Starbucks! lol). The street is very long (something like 13 kms) so we didn't dawdle too long in any one spot. There is a great little \"mall\" with a Harley Davidson shop for you bikers. In short, our couple of hours on the street went way too fast!

It's just one of the few things to do in the area, short of an excursion, beach, or hotel pool. All the shops had the same stuff and the merchants scream at you to come into their shops or buy excursions from them. The pro is if you want to go to a bar or have dinner outside of your hotel, there are many different options. Plenty of taxis to take you here or there if you don't feel like walking on a hot day. You can catch the ferry to Cozumel from here too, which is very convenient. Soon there will be more big box stores in addition to the ones already there (Sunglass Hut, Zara, Starbucks, Hagen Daz, Lacoste, Tommy Hilfiger, Beneton, are already there). Mostly local merchants though, which is cool if that's what you like. Wal-Mart is a few blocks off 5th Avenue as an fyi...Another thing, although Quinta Avenida is expensive, it's cheaper than shopping over in Cozumel. Because the cruise ships come in to Cozumel, the prices increase until 3pm. After 3pm, the prices decrease once the cruise ships leave. Overall though, it's cheaper to shop on Quinta Avenida."

ATM fraud is a huge problem on 5th Ave. We walked up 5th Ave. towards 38th Calle and found several ATM machines with cameras facing the keypad. DO NOT USE ATM MACHINES ON 5TH AVE. The problem was worse than I expected. My bank even stopped the use of my card until I contacted them even though I let them know ahead of time.

It gets really annoying to have people continually prodding you to spend your money on crafts that have been made in a village by hardworking families who only get about 10% of the price you pay. For example, I bought a gourd lamp in a small village on the road to Coba. I paid 18$ to the guy who made it. On 5th the same one sold for $65. How much do you think that family got if any? Wanna come to Mexico to just get drunk and stupid and poorly represent the USA? Then just stay in Cancun and stop making the rest of us look bad. Playa has changed much in the 15 years I've been coming here. Not all of it good. But you can still see and taste true Mexico if you avoid 5th."

Beautiful handmade saddle leather that ages beautifully. I bought a very large satchel which would have cost me upwards of $300 CDN for $80 US. People constantly stop me to ask where I got the bag. The tequila museum also had great prices on tequila but not as cheap as the airport duty free. Note that duty free does not have a large variety.It is definitely worth spending a day on Qinta Avenida. Grab some chocolate from the high end chocolate boutique and roam around.

With that, there are literally every kind of shop, bar, restaurant, hotel, etc imaginable here as far as the eye can see. It's divided into sections, split by Av Constituyentes that runs perpendicular to it. Almost every street intersection has a map you can look at to see where you are. It is so vast, we only got to see half of it due to a timeline (our hotel's shuttle was leaving in an hour & a half). My wife and I went from Ave Constitutyentes all the way up to N 4th Street, but then we had to head back to the hotel shuttle. We never got to visit the opposite side, going from N 20th Avenue and up.The time we did spend though, we were pleasantly surprised at how busy it was (it was the afternoon) and how many shops there were. Of course, there are tons of shops that are similar, we still had a good time. There's currently a lot of commercial construction going on there, as they are putting in some shopping malls along the avenue.I heard it gets even busier at night. Next time we go to Mexico, I'll be sure to allot more time, as I really want to try the Mexican restaurants outside of our resort.Last suggestion, WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES. You'll be walking your feet off."

We visited the beginning of May 2015.We were told by our holiday rep that 5th Avenue was one of the best places to go for shopping, but it was a let down when we go there.There were a few up market shops, but the remaining 90% of the Avenue is just the same old touristy shops. There are only so many magnets in the world that can be seen in the repetitive shops.The owners of the shops, are to be frank, a pain in the rear end. What should be an enjoyable stroll on your holiday becomes a constant aggressive sales technique, everyone wants you in their shops. One tip, don't wear a t shirt that has an identifying logo on it. My t-shirt had Chicago written across it and all I heard over and over again was \"Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, come look at my store.\"Some of the store keepers had a great sense of humour with their sales pitches, saying \"come look at my store, let me try and sell you something you don't want.'Beware of various tactics, they will try and say \"remember me, your waiter from the Palladium,\" obviously catching your eye, but then you realise he has just looked at your wrist band but by that time they are in front of you! I think I could have come away from there as high as a kite too, probably near 10 times we were asked if we wanted any tobacco or cigars, when we said no, they asked if we wanted something stronger, any weed or crack. Strange this happens so openly considering the amount of Police parked up there.One highlight was a mexican meal at Tropical on 5th Avenue, very nice food and good to sit down on the front seating area and able to site back, relax and take in the surrounding rather than someone in your face all the time."

If you speak Spanish give them the courtesy of speaking Spanish with them, although a lot of them speak English. There are lots of money exchange locations along the Avenida and are exchanging the current money exchange rates. They exchange dollars and some exchange Euros. Be sure and try \"El Fogon\" restaurant (across from the Mega Commercial). It is only a few blocks from the Quinta Avenida (ask for directions). They are open 1 p.m. to 5 a.m. The local transportation \"collectivos\" are on the main road between Cancun and Playas is reliable and inexpensive. Just wait by the main road, drivers will flash their lights and you hail them down. We stayed at the Grand Mayan, fares to travel to either Cancun or Playas del Carmen were 25 to 30 pesos per person. They come by every 10 to 15 minutes. After 11 p.m. they run about every half hour, running 24 hours a day. We caught a Mayan bus-line bus at 4:00 a.m. on our way to Vallodalid"

And you will be asked if you want to buy...illegal things!actual conversation:On 5th Ave in Mexico Playa Del Carmen:1st Salesman: hello my friends...Come into my store? Me: no thank you 1st Salesman: I have girls for you... Me: NO 1st Salesman: you want my sister, you can have my sister! 2nd salesman: tattoos, piercings? Me: no thanks. 2nd salesman: cocaine? Me to my friend: do I look like the type of person who wants to f\u00a5\u20ack your sister and snort cocaine!?!?Also just avoid the silver shops unless you are ready to haggle prices down on shiny metal that is 99% most likely not silver.Go down all the shops find stuff you like and find the cheapest price and go back and haggle at other shops that had the higher price; a lot of times they will try to beat the price.Food is good, but service can border on pushy and aggressive at times.Beach is fun and happening, there are also cultural shows and local street vendors. DO NOT try to rent a car here, takes forever (us almost 3 hours) and they will try to rip you off.Also, there are sales people trained to recognize your hotel's wristband; so do not fall for their sneaky sales tactics. example:salesman: hey you guys!! Do you remember me??us: nosalesman: I was your server at the buffet at paradisus.us: the buffet we ate at this morning?salesman: yeah that one!us: we did not eat at a buffet this morning!salesman: *turned and walked awaydon't fall for it!"

We loved it. 7 years ago there were more souvenir shops, a few more restaurants and bars and more stations wanting to sell you a tour. This visit we were here 11 nights. 11 days of walking past these same people multiple times a day... they did everything but try and drag us in. Nothing unique, and many non-mexican. We only went into a few of the shops who weren't grabbing us, and 1 restaurant here our last night. No bars. If you like that kind of scene, you can have it. We want the unadulterated places and will have to find a new place to go for our next beach/snorkel vacation. Too many tourists, too loud, and the local craftsmen and shops we loved are gone. In case you are thinking it, this was not spring break and previous visits were summer. Another big thing I noticed. Dogs. I love dogs, but had never seen one here before. Dogs were everywhere, mostly on leashes, but when the pets are coming here on vacation, we know we are in the wrong place."

One favourite trick they use is to use the fact that many tourists are wearing wrist bands issued by the various hotels, to come up to you pretending they know you because they work at your hotels.

Yes, there are a few pushy salesmen, but I've heard it's far worse (and hotter!) in the day time, so go at night.

This commercialized Mexican tourist attraction can be fun, especially at night when the street lights and brightly colored signs and decorations make the place look magical. It's time to loosen up and have some fun! Everyone here wants to help you have a good time on your vacation. By the way, they would also really appreciate it if you spent some of your money in their shop or restaurant!La Quinta is sometimes packed with people walking up and down the street soaking in the sights and sounds (Jan-Jun), and other times not so busy (October). There are souvenir shops, bars, restaurants, jewelry and clothing stores, tequila stores, etc. Prices are generally inflated compared to a couple blocks off this street but most shopkeepers will at least discuss the price if you think it's too much, and consider your offer at a reasonable discount (expect them to accept about half what they asked at first). Remember, they want to move their inventory so don't be taken in by stories about needing money to buy tacos to feed the family. There are so many shops the employees come right up and start walking with you as you pass by and try to persuade you to come into their store. This is very annoying to me after the second or third one in a row. I don't mind the bantering back and forth in conversation with passersby, but when business is slow they can get more aggressive. Don't be a sucker and try to keep a good sense of humor as you say no thank you and walk away while people are still talking to you.The core tourist area runs North/South between Constituyeyes Ave. and Ave. Benito Juarez. There are many, many choices for restaurants with all kinds of International foods. There is a huge variety of vendors in a range of quality from cheap trinkets manufactured in China to high end rock and gem jewelry stores selling very high quality items, which are priced at their top value. If you're buying t-shirts and cheap souvenirs to take back home it helps to speak some Spanish and bargain for everything together to get a better price. Check reviews on Trip Advisor and plan before you go and you will have a better experience. Most places accept credit cards but in my opinion, part of the fun is learning how to negotiate prices in pesos. Most sales people on this street will appreciate your having made the attempt to learn their custom of negotiating. Many vendors can be extremely overbearing. This isn't always the case, but more often than not, if you so much as take a double glance at an item, they are immediately all over you wanting to start the negotiating process.Step 1So you see an item that you want or are interested in. You will next and most obviously ask \"how much?\" The vendor will now give you the inflated price of the item. When you balk, then the vendor will then ask \"how much will you give me?\" DO NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION!. You are now playing verbal/mental chess with the vendor and if you put any value whatsoever to the object, you are now playing right into the negotiating game to the vendor's advantage. He has set the HIGH and you have set the LOW. Your LOW might also be 30 percent or more than you might be able to get the item for by using my technique. Here is the response that you will keep using (even if you have to say it 20 times)....\"IS THAT YOUR LOWEST PRICE?\" No matter what the response by the vendor, it is important that you NEVER-EVER set a price that you are willing to pay. Step 2Now you need to back up the above statement with a little bit of acting, by looking as if you are only lukewarm to the item and couldn't care less if you get it or not. No matter what price he (or she) gives you, put the item back on the shelf or hand it back to the vendor and say that's more than I wanted to pay/I've seen the item for less (not saying how much)/wow/I am going to have to think about it/etc. No matter what, you are leaving because this is when the price starts to seriously drop. Here's a scenario. You have found an item that the vendor say is $50.00. You ask if that is his lowest price. He then asks how much will you offer. You reiterate that you want the lowest price. You go to leave. He says would you give me $30.00. You ask if that is your lowest price. You go to leave. He now asks if you will give him $25.00. If you want to be argumentative at this stage, you could reply...I thought $30.00 was your lowest price (doesn't really matter because you are already beating him up mentally), but generally at this point you can say that you want to cut through the chase and just want to know what the lowest price is and will then make a decision...\"can you do that so that I am not stuck here?\" At this point he might say that the $25.00 is his lowest price or maybe he will make another drop. No matter what, the only way you will find the true rock bottom price is by continually repeating the above steps until finally when you are leaving he is no longer dropping the price. You might even go into the shop next door, then try doing a \"walk by\" of the vendor to see if there is another price drop.Vendors sometimes sell a $50.00 item for under $10.00. If you had countered on that same item with an offer of $20.00, you surely never would have paid under $10.00. Never, and I mean NEVER SET THE PRICE or answer the question \"How much are you willing to pay\" as these are both negotiating disasters.If you try this technique you will be astonished at how low some of the vendors will go. By the way, Vendors hate this technique."

I do like to eat at good restaurants and there were plenty of those. Try La Parilla --- OUTSTANDING! Also, La Fisheria was good. Lastly, just down the street from the hotel, La Vaca Gaucha for good solid Argentinian steaks. Our family really liked the deserts there, so we went back several time for desert. All the restaurants above are within 5 minutes walk of the Soho Playa. There are many more, those were just the good ones that we liked."

(shhhh.... it's all the same stuff) We did eat at two of the restaurants on 5th and I'll review them separately but it was not as good tasting or as good a value as the food on 10th or any of the other streets just off 5th. My recommendation: do it once. Take the walk down 5th in the evening. During the morning nothing is fully open and set up until 8:30-9 ish. It can be very hot during the lunch time hours with a ton of cruise ship tourists from Cozumel coming in non stop and the sun bearing down."

It's an entertaining stroll if you are looking to get off of the beach for a few hours. Great places to enjoy a drink and people watch. Many of the stands selling tours will be aggressive. Our hotel concierge told us stories of many of those places ripping people off (either with no shoes or inaccurate tours). So we completely avoided them. Beware: I was approached SEVERAL times by locals trying to sell things that are definitely illegal in the US. There wasn't any harassment but I was surprised by its abundance.

Making deals and bringing home some neat things and the stories to go with it.I expected the same in Play del Carmen on 5th avenue. For sure you can have the same experience but at a much larger scale, block upon block of stores.If you are ready to shop they are ready to sell, but if you are ready to just get to your destination it is slow and painful. Solicitations to shop or eat are non-stop. Ahh, and don't touch me. One sales person tried a gimmick that was insulting to both of us, \"don't you remember me? I was your waiter!\" and then he touched me. Really? Who is this funny to? Do I look that dumb? Do you not care how you look?I really thought I wouldn't care but this was the main pathway from our place to anywhere else. We did often go up a block to avoid the crowds.But on a good note, there is no lack of things to look at and buy. We had fun tequila tasting and haggling for a few items. Going just off 5th will get you better deals. The further north you went seemed to have many more, newer looking restaurants. It was fun for me to tour and look at the buildings. So many interesting places and buildings.We stumbled on more things, as I said, just off 5th - a bakery called bacana, babes noodle bar, ah Cacao and Tepoznieves ice cream and a store with some cheaper souvenirs we bought. It is also fun to hang out near the main plaza near the ferry dock. There are often shows there and the chapel is very picturesque.As an additional note, we walked to the other side (south) of the ferry dock and walked around Playacar. There are ruins scattered all over the grounds and we walked through this park area and it was peaceful and fun. It was also fun to walk around the vacation homes there - so unique and really interesting. I think I saw a sign for Xaman Ha condos when there, too, just to help place it. I highly recommend this area for a walk or run."

Handlers used to be there holding them out for tourists to take pictures of and handle. My only sadness here, is that one does remain. There is a little baby monkey at the end of 5th Avenue toward Playacar. He's in a high end mall. He is shamelessly promoted by his handler for tourist photo taking. At the end of the day the handler takes home in a little kennel. It's very sad. All that monkey gets to do all day is sit on top of tourists heads, and be handled by strangers."

It cost $35 pesos each from Akumal to Playa del Carmen. We were dropped off two blocks from Fifth Avenue. There wasn't a problem walking through the streets, we felt perfectly safe. I'd highly recommend taking the collectivo to Fifth Avenue, but perhaps consider taking a cab back to your resort, especially if you plan to stay later in the evening as we did. I had made arrangements with our private guide to take us back, and it was 350 pesos for the two of us to return to the Grand Palladium resort.I'd read about being hassled to come into the shops, and yes, we were bothered somewhat, and did hear the usual 'Don't you remember me? I was your waiter last night at your resort!' comments. However, these do lessen after it gets dark, and Fifth Avenue is much more attractive by night, although it does tend to get busy. No one gave us a hard time once it was dark, so perhaps that's the best way to do your browsing/shopping. All of the shops are usually open until 10 pm.There are tons of shops, so much that it became overwhelming at times, as there is so much repetition of articles, and you have to keep looking to find the cheapest prices, as they certainly vary from place to place. So many restaurants as well, with beautifully decorated interiors. There are a few really nice ladies' shops - I found good deals and nice items at a store called 'Crush', near 2nd Street, where we came in from the collectivo street. There was also a nice handcraft store farther down with many things made in Mexico by craftsmen near the end, approximately at 38th Street.Look for the street performers and mariachis as well. We went for dinner at 'Oh lala' a few blocks up on 14 North Street. Be sure to make a reservation first, there weren't any empty tables and I made my reservation 3 weeks in advance. It's the #1 restaurant in Playa, and we certainly enjoyed our meal there.A fun evening, don't miss this trip to Playa del Carmen for something different!"

Walk the street to say you've done it, make your rounds and leave. sure there are lots of restaurants and bars but they are all Americanized... to the point where I heard Def Leppard playing.. to the point where you look around and everyone is from Middle America with a fanny pack or Cancun shirt on.

Also, there is some great nightlife but we were usually asleep by 1030 so we didn't take advantage of it. We were too busy having amazing time and early wake ups to waste the night away in the nightlife so I can't address that specifically. But the store \"Amber\" who not only taught us about how to find real vs fake amber by a charming shop worker Ernesto was awesome and there items gorgeous! I bought a heart pendant which I will post in pic. You can geocache on the avenida- the Canadian place was a blast- if you've never done that you SHOULD! Great for singles, families or couples and free to do. Just download the geocache app or Google search it and start having fun. We've done it as a couple and as a family all around the world and always super fun. The restaurant Carboncitos was FABULOUS and the restaurant Tierra Madre was expensive and adequate at best. The bar Mannes was so fun! Bottom line was that if you tripadvisor the places you will spend less and have a great time and if you don't you'll spend more and have a good time but no matter what you'll enjoy it. Don't forget to tip well like in America 15-20%. And don't be surprised if people offer you illegal substances on the street but be smart and don't take any ;-).

Walk up to 10th Ave if you want to avoid the hassle. We do! You'll find better food at better prices. If you must visit 5th Ave., the daytime is best as long as a cruise ship has not dropped off it's passengers."

Avenue number five (Quinta Avenida) is the main attraction for most tourists visiting Playa Del Carmen.Some will say it is what tickles their taste buds the most and that it is the highlight of the trip to Mexico, while others are less impressed by the long stretch of road that runs parallel to the coast of the city.This avenue is crammed, packed to the rafters with everything that can squeeze a dime or a dollar out of a tourist. There are salespeople literally grabbing hold of ladies, in their effort to make a sale. It seems as the salesmen believe that tourists, who have been able to make enough decisions to get there, now are incapable of finding our way into their stores without help.It is not okay in my part of the world, to grab hold of people! I take it as an invasion of my private space and I will not only defend myself vigorously, but also do anything but follow that salesperson into a store.Americans tend to enjoy the atmosphere of Fifth Avenue, and they happily spend hours, as well as dollars, in the trendy stores along the route, while myself, and most Europeans I talked to, think it is tacky and overpriced pretty much everywhere along the street.Should you decide that you are ready to rumble with the crowd, bring a water bottle, sensible walking shoes and prepare to elbow your way through the thousands of people who mill around here. The funniest time is in the late evening, when the crowds from the cruise ships are herded around the area, and the most quiet is in the mornings when the street sweepers and shop keepers are preparing for a new day.Best thing about the Fifth Avenue is that it is the only area in Playa Del Carmen where one can go with a wheel chair without too much problem. All other areas in the city are close to impossible for all but the most hardened chair veterans.For a more genuine Mexican shopping experience, I would recommend Avenue 30. It is full of stores where the locals shop, and restaurants where they eat, at prices that you will never ever find on Fifth Avenue."

I even had one gentleman (Fernando) go and search his neighboring, competing, shops for what I was looking for, because he didn't have it himself!I'm glad I went, it was definitely an experience, but because of the few rotten apples, spoiling it for the rest, I won't go back.To the vendors, if you see this:If we were left alone to come and go to browse, as we wished, without harassment, I would have spent a lot more money.

For those interested in enjoying a fine cigar while walking the strip, there are 2 places that have quality, legit cigars stored in appropriately humidified humidors. La Casa Del Habano on 5th around calle 28. The other is La Casa Paratagas on 5th at calle 5 near the south end. Both shops have legit Cuban cigars. LCDH also makes a nice Mojito for your stroll. Prices at both shops are insanely expensive, so don't plan on getting a bargain. The quality cigar plus the experience is worth the $20-$40USD you will spend on a Cuban cigar. Don't buy cigars anywhere else.Lots of street side places to stop for a few cocktails to people watch. We found most of the Mexican souvenirs to be priced pretty high. We negotiated on most clothing items down about $20-$30USD at the small shops."

Add that to all the colors from the shops and buildings and it is a fun place to visit. At night 5th Avenue takes on a different look as the lights give it another look which is in itself very impressive. One of the aspects of 5th Avenue that we always look forward to and enjoy is the people watching. Grab a seat somewhere and take in the sights and sounds of the street and then watch all the people from all over the world walking up and down enjoying themselves. One word of caution...the time share folks are alive and well on 5th Avenue so beware of a seemingly friendly voice that will lead into a time share presentation. All in all,, 5th Avenue is a place not to miss in Playa del Carmen so be sure and take the walk down the avenue when you are there. You won't regret it!"

We usually took a cab back for $5.00. There are many shops ranging from your high end international favorites to the basic souvenir shops. One shop sold gladiator sandals with interchangeable laces and accessories - a Mexican product/design which I've never seen before. I loved the Mexican lamp shops and there were many of them, just couldn't see traveling back home with one of those lamps. There were many choices of restarurants too and street vendors selling nicely cut and packed fruit cups - I had some and I didn't get sick. There are also some night spots that we heard others talk about back at our resort. I got to learn a bit about the native tribal communtiy in that area - most dressed in traditional attire and most are vendors and shop owners. Just be aware of the pushy salesmen in the streets and near the ferry terminal trying to sell excursions etc....but otherwise a very nice area to visit."

I love to go up and down the street people watching, buying some souvenirs, and have a few drinks at street bars. It is a great place where you can find a fine designer store and next door a Mexican trinket store. The prices are not all that great but I find a great selection of shirts and caps that I want. Also bought a new pair of Maui Jim sunglasses for about the same price I could buy them back home but no sales tax so that was pretty good. I love to stop at street bars to sit in the shade sipping a rum and coke just watching the people go by. So if you are looking for a big bargain price on something you want you probably will not find it but if you want to enjoy the day soaking up kind of a festival atmosphere this is the place to go. Of course the store hawkers are out front trying every way to get you inside but that is the culture there and I enjoy it.

The street venders are quite aggressive and will not take no for an answer. After 2 weeks they still bothered us every time we walked by and it gets old fast! The food is very good and you can find everything from pasta and pizza to lobster and Mexican food. The resturants are great but very expensive. If you venture off 5th to some of the other streets it becomes much more authentic and much cheaper prices. 5th is fun to see but after you have been up and down the street once it gets old quick! Check out the other streets and you won't be disappointed!"

You also have the shopping block called Paseo del Carmen, with e.g. Mart\u00ed sport, Tequila/Farmacy, Starbucks and Tommy Hilfiger and Pull & Bear.The fifth goes on forever but I would say that up to street 40 is basically it. Half way up (fifth and av.Constituyentes) you have a mall called Quinta Alegr\u00eda (=\"fifth joy\", a wordplay with \"quinta avenida\"=fifth ave). Here you have Aldo, Victoria's Secret and much more.Along the way you will find a church, the bus station, banks, hotels, souvenir stores, farmacies, restaurants and bars. You will also pass a couple of Liverpool (mini department stores), h\u00e4agen dazs, Subway, McDonald's, Burger King and Aldo's. There are a lot of nice dinner restaurants on and around 5th. You will also find a lot of tattoo parlours, dive shops and exchange booths above and under 5th.Night time the bar life is concentrated some blocks north, south, west and east of 5th ave. and 12th street.

It is always interesting to hear the latest 'barker' phrase from the folks trying to sell you some service or get you into their shop. Last year's favorite (\"Hey, remember me? I am the waiter from your hotel!\") gave way to this year's (\"Hey, we were in high school together.\" or \"Are you looking for my sister?\"). They don't make much money, and their survival depends on separating you from a little dinero. Have fun with and throw a little back at them (\"I do remember you, and the service could have been better!\" drew a smile and \"Oh, I see how you are now!\"). All in good fun, and a traditional part of the Mexican banter.My favorite places along the pedestrian way are the numerous massage spots such as my favorite - Sabai Spa - or the shop selling liquor and generics of US pharmaceuticals at bargain prices. And of course some of the craziest T-shirts you can imagine (Does someone actually wear these in public?). It is all there from the cheap traditional Mexican crapola to high end jewelry and many bars and eateries. And all the while it maintains a safe, and laid back atmosphere. There is a great, eclectic mix of people from attractive young people to families to couples. It is a good time, though pretty hot even at night in the summer!"

The tourist shops are like those in any tourist town and most of the items are pricy but if you do not have a car to go out of the area most tourists buy what they need there. The night clubs are fun lots of energy and excitement. On New Years Eve it reminded me of Times Square. I read one of the other reviews and they stated Mexican coffee is not worth drinking. I am a coffee drinker at least six cups a day and the coffee here both packages and restaurant is excellent. Like any place else you can go to a place that makes a bad cup of coffee. This would be the exception not the rule.Once the vendors find out you are a local you are treated differently more like a friend not a tourist just a greeting and they do not try to sell you anything. The chapel at the end is beautiful and the beach with the Mayan sculpture is well worth seeing. Fifth Ave.is a interesting street filled with energy and great food and nightclubs."

Ice cream for 4 people wound up being like $40 US, should have looked at the prices before we ordered, I think there was cheaper treats to be had on the Avenida. Overall it was an ok 1/2 day, and if you are looking for cheap souvenirs rather than buying things from a resort gift shop it's a good place to go."

You can shop for everything from junky trinkets to high end merchandise. Musicians stroll the streets and they will stop to play for you for for a few bucks.Be aware of the store barkers who constantly call out to you... \"Cheapy, cheapy\". You get used to it and simply ignore them. Barter hard to get the best deal. Decide what you are willing to pay and don't pay more than that. If you can't get your price, move on because you can find the same stuff at many stores.5th Ave people watching is great. Grab a spot, have a beer, get some guacamole and relax. Everything will walk by you! When you go, wear comfortable footwear as most of it is cobblestones and skinny heels won't work well. Also be aware everything is really open air so it will be warm.

This of course is the main tourist area of Playa del Carmen so don't be surprised to find yourself being somewhat harassed by the vendors and shop owners to come in and check out their stuff. It's only one block off the beach which is beautiful. There's also the ferry terminal over to Cozumel. The entire area probably runs at least 10 city blocks long so you can end up being there for some time if you don't get tired of walking. The entire street is all shops and vendors, small boutique hotels, bars and restaurants, pharmacies, cambios (banks/currency exchange) and there's also a new mall. We personally don't like to be harassed by what are usually extremely pushy shop owners so when we want to actually shop, we stick to the big box stores (you'll recognize them as soon as you see them - some are so big that they are two stories high and look like a large department store you would find at home). These larger stores have fixed prices for everything so you can browse at your leisure, not be followed constantly by someone offering you a \"deal\" and not have to haggle (mind you, some people enjoy the thrill of the haggling so whatever you're into I guess). There are high end shops as well but don't expect any better pricing than you would find at the same store at home. We ate at some of the locals places on the ave a few times and although expensive, the food was spectacular!There are some locals with baby jaguars or leopards or spider monkeys that charge you money to take photos of yourself holding them. As tempting as this may be to some, don't fall prey to this. I did once a couple of years ago and felt so horrible for this animal, it was so lethargic from the heat that it barely moved - it's really sad. There are also street performers who dress up in full traditional Mayan clothing or as Michael Jackson or things of the sort, again for money to take photos with them. It's definitely a sight to see and in my opinion, not something you should miss out if you are in the area, even if just for a short visit!"

The shops are mildly interesting, and perhaps a good place to pick up a few cheesy gift items for the folks at home (most of which have \"Playa del Carmen\" scrawled on them somewhere). Street performers rely on their questionable Mayan heritage to dress in outrageous feathered costumes and play traditional instruments to get their cut of the tourist pie. Some fellows even resort to using small monkeys. Shopkeepers are aggressive, and the competition for dollars/pesos is fierce. I enjoyed going down to the beach and people watching much more than looking in the shops. If you are in Playa del Carmen anyway, it's worth a look, but otherwise it's very skip-able."

As many others have remarked, this is a very typically pedestrian shopping street. It's really not much different from similar areas in major cities around the world. Here in Boston, it would be comparable to Faneuil Hall Marketplace, although the vendors are perhaps a bit more aggressive at getting your attention. But no one is getting in your face to force you to come inside. We found them all pretty nice and laid back, actually. There are high-end luxury boutiques, middle-of-the-road sorts of places, places to buy cheap chintzy touristy stuff, etc. The vendors are harmless - simply smile and say \"no thanks\" if you are not interested. If you are planning a tour in the area, there are several booths set up selling the same trips throughout the area. You can play one off the other to get the best price. They all seem to be booking for EasyTours which has an office around the corner. I don't know, but the prices might be better booking direct. There are many excellent restaurants and eateries on and near 5th. Just run a \"search nearby\" on TripAdvisor and you will know what to expect."

We took a collectivo from our hotel and it cost us around 3 dollars each so very cheap indeed and well with taking a look. This place is full of shops, bars & restaurants. We stopped for a drink & had a meal here too. It's got plenty of souvenir shops plus a shopping mall. It's nothing spectacular but well worth a look if you have a couple of hours to spare. Both times we have been here we were offered drugs whilst walking around, it's uncomfortable but you have to politely say no & walk away. Also, avoid photographs with the animals as I've read lots of stories about animal cruelty. The bars and restaurants aren't cheap but it is a busy tourist town so things will vary in price from shops and restaurants. Have a look around before buying anything to get to grips with the average price for things. It is nice to stop at a bar & have a drink and a look around around so definitely worth a trip here. Also, when getting the collectivo home you have to walk away from 5th Avenue to get to the stop, it's about 3 blocks away and you can easily take a wrong turn. Make sure you remember exactly where you were dropped off especially if its late at night. We actually got lost and ended up down a back street away from the crowds. Taxis are a lot easier as they are all over 5th Avenue. At night time I would of preferred using a private taxi rather than the collectivo."

            "review": "Go for the people watching and some restaurants, not for the shopping.. Yes, Quinta Avenida has gotten much more tourisy and overpriced in recent years. Yes, if you look like an easy mark you will be harassed to no end. But if you are staying at the resorts, all you have to do when you want some serious shopping and cheap authentic Mexican food is to leave the tourist street and just walk a few blocks inland. (The much less touristy area begins at 15th Ave, only 2 blocks inland!) As far as Quinta Avenida itself, it's great for people watching, very limited shopping, and a handful of good restaurants. Here are some tips for our friends from across the pond:-Some of the larger souvenir shops have fixed prices and are not unreasonable for tourist areas. I would look in these and avoid completely the little shops where you are heckled to come in. -The same goes for the restaurants. There are some excellent bars and restaurants on Quinta Avenida. They are all overpriced by Mexican standards. Do your research beforehand and know where you want to go before you arrive on Quinta Avenida. Though there is usually someone standing outside to greet anyone who shows an interest in dining there, as a general rule, a good restaurant does not need to have someone in the street actively soliciting passers-by to come and eat there.-Walmart and Mega are two large supermarkets a five block walking distance from Quinta Avenida, at 30th Av.-The stranger you meet in the street was not your waiter the night before at the hotel. -Non-gringo priced food and shopping start at about 15th Av, especially along Avenida Juarez where you can get cheap bathing suits, sandals, flip flops, etc. There are loads of restaurants where you can get breakfast for 35-50 pesos, stuff your face with 5 tacos and a drink for 50 pesos, and shop in a much more local and cheaper atmosphere.-If you want a large mall go to Plaza las Americas in the residential area of Playa. There are lots of great stores for relatively inexpensive clothes, shoes, as well as a nice movie theater and a huge supermarket. You will need a taxi to get there. It's only 35 pesos from the center, but DO NOT TAKE THE TAXIS FROM THE TAXI RANKS ALONG QUINTA AVENIDA These stands rip off tourists and charge them whatever they want. Hail a moving taxi on the street instead. -It helps if you speak at least some real Spanish and not just a token amount with a bad accent.-The taxi fare to and from Playacar has recently been raised from 70 to 90 pesos. (which is currently about $6.) If you ask how much beforehand, you will be charged as much as you look like they can get away with charging you. The 90 pesos covers all of the Center of Playa Del Carmen, including Mega and Walmart and Quinta Avenida all the way as far north as 34th Street. Again, hail a passing taxi a block inland from 5th, and pay 90 pesos when you are back at your resort in Playacar. -Have fun."

Why do they ask such absurd prices for things? More than in London? Surely if they rip off one person then they lose 20 others which maybe explains why they all look so bored in their empty shops. Like others have said people pretend to know you, they don't.

What a transformation: Quinta Avenida is basically a long road packed full of restaurants, bars, souvenir shops, cigar shops, large malls, basically everything you can think of crammed in one street. It's overwhelming, feels touristy and has none of the charm of the real Mexico. You'll see people with Monkeys and Snakes trying to put them on you for a picture, for which you'll have to pay for of course. I was more concerned about the animal being in such a place, chained to the 'owner'. There are some decent restaurants and bars around, mainly nearer to 5th Avenue and Calle 30, which is quieter and seems more upscale. It's definitely a great place to people watch and just meander around, but it became too much after the 2nd day."

Very easy to get a cab almost anywhere along the road. (Be sure to finalize a price before you get into a cab!)Cons: Most of the stores sell the same things & we were constantly accosted by local vendors as we passed by. Their tactics were amusing at first but became annoying very quickly. (We were told that if you are carrying a plastic shopping bag, they will harass you more as that shows them that you are actually spending money.)It is worth walking the Avenida at least once - if only for the exercise!"

There are a lot of cool lounges, bars, and shops to see here. I did not like to see the animal exploitation taking place here however. I would give Quinta Avenida a 5 star if the Government addressed this. I am referring to a baby lion that appears sedated and close to death. People ask for money to have their picture taken with it. There are also monkeys being used to generate tourist revenue here."

I knew it before I came but was still unprepared for the onslaught from the local vendors and restaurant owners. We have met a great tour company and found lots of great ways to leave town. Even enjoyed our outing to buy some groceries at the local grocery store. As my profile says, I am a budget traveler. I have found very little of that here. I will say that there are some interesting looking restaurants here on the Avenida, but I prefer to hunt out the less pricey options a little off the beaten path. There are some good stores on the street, but as soon as I look right or left, the vendors are using their worn scripts on me to try to get me to come into their shop."

First went to 5th Ave almost 3 years ago now and went again this past week... it has grown a lot in just that time. Unfortunately there is still lots of hustling and now a mall with stores you would see at home (if you're from Canada or the US). It's great to shop and find things for a decent price but shopper beware of the vendors approaching you/calling out to you and being very persistent. It is just how it is so be prepared and be comfortable saying, \"no\" or just walking away if you need to. Aside from that... you generally will get a good price and you should be comfortable negotiating as they are more than willing to do that. So go with an open mind and enjoy the experience just remember to wear your big girl panties on that day."

First traveled here 27 years ago and have been going back to this area every year, it has changed to much it is not the quaint little town that it used to be. It is a must see for people wanting to do a little shopping and to pick up some souvenirs. they built a mall on 5th. and it is full of high end American stores, not what I want to see when I'm in Mexico. They are tearing down all the older hotels and stores and building American/European stores pushing out the small stores and venders. I like to have fun and enjoy my walk along 5th. ave but it has been taken over by drug dealers, you can't walk 5 feet without someone trying to sell you drugs one of the nice old hotels on 5th. is now a Brothel. Hate to say it but things are going downhill, I guess that's progress. Time to find a new place to travel. Not to say it is not safe but it has changed.The people I have met over the years that work there are still some of the best people I know and there not happy about it but can do nothing about it.Stay safe and have a good time."

However, Playa del Carmen was still that little beach town outisde of Cancun. However, in 2014 all of that has changed and Playa del Carmen is no longer that little beach town we probably all loved. It is now a commercially attractive beach town with many coporate luxury hotels similar to what Cancun has been a while and Quinta Avenida (5th avenue) is the center of all of this consisting of blocks with stores, cafes, and restaurants. Everything is priced above market value. All the restaurants are quite pricey (i.e. expensive) and you will find Starbucks, McDonalds and Burger King: things I thought the average traveler or tourist wanted to get away from when they went on vacation in the first the place. However, it gets at excellent anyway because I'm impressed with the beautification and cleanliness of this street in Playa del Carmen. It is just entertaining to walking of up and down being harassed by vendors for tours, photo ops with animals, souvenirs, and massages. This is not the street to be on if you want to to enjoy the Mexican culture and have a peaceful vacation. Get out and explore real Mexico and use Quinta Avenida for what is worth. Happy Travels!!!!"

Prices have sky rocketed in that area, overpopulated with loud bars and tourist shops. New plazas (shop malls) with American stores are sprouting in what once was a street with a nice town feel. Starbucks killed the local coffee shops, and H\u00e4agen Dazs can be found every few corners, as well as Burger King.

Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue) - not to be confused with super high end luxury shopping in New York, is a long stroll down a street with pretty much anything for sale, from souvenirs to sandals. A new indoor mall even has stores like American Eagle and Forever 21 for the younger crowd. However, that should also clue you in as to the creeping Americanization of an otherwise pleasant shopping experience...if shopping is what you are looking for. There are also many nice places to grab a bite to eat, bars if that is your scene, and plenty to see. There seemed to be people offering cheap massages on almost every corner, as well as the occasional offer of marijuana and other things. Be aware you will suffer the typical vendor mob as you walk down the avenue. Take my advice, just stroll along and ignore them all, but keep an eye out for what you want. Once you are done walking to the end, turn around, walk back to the places you saw what you wanted, and go directly there. Don't forget that bargaining is, for the most part, expected, and you will get taken to the cleaners if you don't have the stomach to play hard to get. Overall, it was a nice place to find some things for the kids, some souvenir shirts, and some jewelry, had a nice lunch, and enjoyed the sunshine."

The cab ride was only $14 US from the Sandos Caracol and we made arrangements with our nice cab driver to pick us up again in about 4 hours. The outskirts driving in didn't look as busy or as safe, so we stuck to Quinta.There are quite a few restaurants to try and shops to see - they even have a mall with larger brand name stores like Victoria Secret, Nike, etc. However, we spent about a good hour of our time at one of those booths where they sell excursions. They waved us over and we just wanted to compare prices with our hotel (btw, shop around because there are many excursion booths and prices may vary) but they took up a great deal of our browsing time because they were pretty aggressive about closing a sale and kept talking every time we tried to say we would come back later. They were nice, but it was a little annoying to have so much of our time taken up. In the end, we did purchase an excursion to Isla Mujeres, which I will review later.There's quite a bit to see on the street from restaurants to shops, massage places, and sports bars. The reason I only give it an average rating is because of all of the hustlers trying to get you to come over and talk to them or sell you something every few steps. We had one guy try to tell us he was our waiter from our resort the night before and to come talk to him and shake his hand. I've read in other posts that this is one of the scams they use to get you to talk to them. They look at the AI bands from your resort and automatically know you're a tourist and sometimes know which resort. If you don't go up to them, some of them will even go so far as to walk up to you. We even had one guy ask us if we wanted to buy cigars and when we said we didn't smoke, he offered us drugs or \"nose candy\". I understand these guys have to make a living, but these aggressive hustlers became pretty tiring and annoying to deal with after a while and that's why we never made a second trip to Quinta.Had dinner at Yaxche Mayan cuisine which was decent but overpriced. The prices on Quinta are only slightly lower than hotel prices for souvenirs and food wasn't cheap. Peeked at the massage prices and they were definitely lower than at the resorts, but the places looked a bit sketchy from the outside. If you have a chance, try the fish spa located at the front of the Wayan store across from Victoria Secret. It's actually just a couple of foot tubs at the entrance of the store, so don't look for a spa like we did. It's a neat experience and your feet feel so soft after :)It was pretty average experience, so unless I had a reason to come back to Quinta Avenida like partying at nightclubs or was accompanied by a local to show us around, I probably wouldnt' come back."

The cab ride was awesome into town, Cabbie drove like he stole it, not quite sure if it wasn't! My wife sat in the back with another couple as we drove down the busy streets. Once we stepped out of the cab, we went into one of the open stores to see what gifts we could bring back. I loved it my wife, on the other hand, felt overwhelmed with all the vendors. Walked down to the beach and everyone and their mother was offering to give massages. Enjoyed the scenic views and loved interacting with the people. Crossed one thing off my bucket list, I live in Texas and I listen to Big Al Mack on 106.1 Kiss fm, so I had to stop in and have a beer at Big Al's Beer Bucket."

But there are also many amazing things to see, eat and watch. You shouldn't miss it! We went in the evenings and got to see a costumed Mayan dance troupe performing (with fire!) at the \"beach stage\" at the end of Avenida Quinta, another Mayan troupe swinging high overhead head-first on what looked like a giant \"top\" in the plaza, a man with a lemur on a leash (as my son said, \"Just like King Julian from Madagascar!\"), a number of monkeys on leashes, roaming mariachi bands, breakdancers - it's like an open-air carnival all night long on a huge pedestrian avenue (closed to cars)! The vendors we encountered were all very friendly and other than the usual precautions you'd take in any crowded place, we felt very safe and had a great time. Be sure to check out some of the shops as we found some lovely artisan shops \"tucked in between\" the many shops selling t-shirts and mini sombreros. You'll love it!"

We even saw a native Mayan dance in the square! Just be prepared to say \"No\" many times because everyone wants you to visit their shop, buy their excursion, etc. and that part we did not care for. However, overall it was a great experience and we were able to purchase just about all our souvenirs from one shop!

What I would say is if you look like a tourist locals may be subject to change or edit pricing for you. Either way some of the handmade crafts or items they sell might be worth it depending on what you are looking for. The only reason I am not giving this area the 5th star is because the sales people can become overwhelming at times and lose track of realizing when no means no.

A peaceful and quite walk that may even bring surprises... a great wine store, a few nice restaurants, Impreviste, just to name one, but most of all, no hassling vendors! There is also the 10th avenue that is parallel to the 5th all the way long. It is a bit dark at places and you have to watch your step a few places. But you can find nice spots also.The fifth avenue does get to be quite nerve racking after a few days but that's where the people are. It is an endless venue of identical shops and restaurants. You've seen one you've seen them all. A bit of diversity would be welcome! But it is useless in being rude to these people who are just trying to make a living for their families. It is easier to just smile and say no gracias and continue on your way without stopping. If you do stop, well that opens a door to more insisting and hassling! Smile, wave, that's all it takes! Think of your next day at the beautiful beach!"

Haggle hard and stick to your price, yet show genuine interest in both the goods and the seller. Have fun, but don't get trapped!"

I live in Mexico part time and know the system ~ a bit of playful banter goes a long way. I always let the vendors know I live in Mexico and don't need a ring, bag, shot of tequila, etc., but I will stop and chat with a few along my way. I love the amber shop ~ have been buying pieces from them for years, never pushy and great selection. Yes, there are tons of souvenir shops ~ obviously people keep them in business. Some are very tacky. There are also some very unique shops, like the little shop that sells all things heart shaped. There are some decent restaurants and hotels still, but I wouldn't want to be in the midst of all the chaos. The avenue now has a lot of big chains, such as Starbucks, Burger King, Victoria's Secret, MAC cosmetics, etc., which had really changed the vibe. It's something to do ~ if it's offensive to you, catch a cab and leave. Please do not participate in the tourist attractions that exploit wild animals, such as having your photo taken with a little monkey or iguana. This creates an imbalance in nature and many of these animals end up sick or dying from being over handled or feed inappropriate foods. Take Quinta Avenida with a grain of salt ~ have a look ~ but the beaches out of the main area are much cleaner and prettier."

The coffee is wonderful and the baguettes are awesome. They serve a breakfast combo for $8 US that comes with everything, including fresh juice, eggs, and coffee. Try also the ginger and mint lemonade. On the other hand: one rest to AVOID is Lucky Luciano since they have a very uncommon and risky practice that can end in identity thief : this is: when a customer pay with credit card they ask for an id and they (without your consent) write down all you drivers license or passport information (#, your name, address etc.). When we notice that they wrote down all of our personal information we ask them to void the transaction and explain that this was illegal, but they refuse since that was a management requirement. This is completely absurd and this practice is illegal. You should show your id to validate your identity but they can not keep all your information, THIS IS A VERY RISKY PRACTICE for you as customer...please avoid this place. What if someone take that receipt? The only 2 things needed to stole you identity is an id number and your name. Even if you pay in cash this place is not worthy. And I will not sponsor a restaurant with this practices."

We can only review it for what we experienced, which was about 3 hours in the afternoon, and we didn't have time to stop at a restaurant.It's certainly an area looking to grab tourist dollars, but Mexico-touristy is a lot different than Canada/US-touristy, so we found it interesting. Lots of shop employees outside the shop trying to convince you to come see their various trinkets, which is a style of business a lot of travelers to this area of Mexico should be familiar with (they pressure, barter, try to get your attention, etc.). We had no problem saying no to them, and we weren't harassed in any way when we did.There was a lot of the sort of kitschy non-unique souvenir stuff, but also some nice stuff and interesting attractions along the way (I'll review them if those individual stores appear on Tripadvisor). We didn't bother with the stores that also appear frequently in Canada/US. I imagine it would be super busy in the evening, but possibly a lot of fun, too. If you usually stick to resorts, as we had, we highly recommend 5th avenue as a break from the resort with a touch of culture, but by no means off the beaten path."

It was a short 15 minute walk from our resort but it was nice to do this especially after one of the meals of the day which leaves you quite full and in need of some exercise.You will find many flea market style shops and all the specialty stores you wish, and if you are missing your coffee, yes a starbucks (no timmies for us Canadians though!!). There are a lot of bed and breakfasts that you can rent in town and we just might do this another time. Lots of fun, lots of people, and of course, lots of annoying sales people. You just say no and move on. There is a quant church and in the square some entertainment. Prices are reasonable, especially in the flea market type stores and you will also find the bus station right there if you are coming in from the airport and have a b and b booked.If you get tired, the taxi ride back is a simple 5-7 dollars."

If you stay in Playas del Carmen, this will be the street you will most likely walk through each day and by the end of the 1st day you wish there was more to see. Very overpriced. If you like illegal animals being used for photos and tour operators begging you to visit their booth, then this place if for you. It was so disappointing. It was sad that there were Mariachi players strolling around waiting for someone to tip them so they could play. The 5 days I was there, I only saw one tourist pay them to play. Very sad."

One can even feel very safe walking alone. So glad that our condo was within walking distance so we did not have to battle trying to find a parking space. If you do need to get there by car, I would suggest getting a taxi as parking is very limited, especially at night."

This is such a fun \"tourista\" place- all the vendors trying to get you into their establishments, trying their latest 'schtick' on the tourists: years ago the mantra was \"...Cheaper than Walmart, almost free...\", now it is \"...Hey, I'm your waiter from your resort- it's my day off- come into my family's shop...\"- not as cool, but certainly still creative. It's a place one can go wander & explore, ignoring the street vendors, or not, checking out the various shops, drinking offered samples of tequila and xtabentun, and just drinking in the whole, entire character of 5th Avenue. When I was there on a day by myself, on the beach I watched an indigenous Mayan group of performers do their 'male pole dance' (as I term it) -they'll start at the top of a tall pole & spin their way (upside down) all the way to the ground. It's really a neat performance & I've seen it done at Tulum also. You can still haggle with the vendors, although not as well as in previous years, but you can still get some bargains. If you ignore the Chinese imports, you can still find handicrafts made locally/regionally (silver, hanging lamps made from hollowed out gourds, things like that...) There is also a great art gallery there: Galeria de Arte 5ta Avenida, that showcases Mexican artists- definitely visit there. Unfortunately some huge commercial establishments have built a presence at one end of Fifth Avenue (Tommy Bahama, Pandora, etc) & that definitely takes away from some of the character of the Avenue- it's starting to feel somewhat more like Cancun (the States with a different accent)- but I guess that's progress (sigh). If you continue up the Avenue, you'll come to the terminal for the ferry to Cozumel (and THAT's an island worth doing a day trip to visit when you're in the Playa). All in all, it's hokey, it's touristy & it's just a lot of fun to go there. And, if you wish to party, you can do that too. It's all here. The Avenue has a certain uniqueness, a certain 'ambiance', a certain character all its own- each time we travel to Playa del Carmen we make it a point to visit & explore at least once."

The vendors on the street, also know that they will get just about what they are asking for the goods, because of the huge turnover of tourists every day, so that allows them to not vary much from the prices, the one vendor that we talked to about a silver torquise ring, would only offer a 10% discount from his asking price.

The local shops all want your business and as you walk down the street they shout for your attention. It's just Mexico style. I have become a master of ignoring it, I think. If I wasn't intentionally seeking out an item, I just ignored the vendor. They aren't overly aggressive, even at night, but they are aggressive. They're trying to make a living, I get that. I did notice that the prices start out ridiculous at the local vendors shops, but if you're willing to haggle with them, you can get a great deal. You can find glassware, pottery, hats, etc. at most local vendor's spots. I wouldn't buy at the first shop I visited. I'd get there best price and take that to the next guy. Make sure you're getting the best deal. The restaurants are lined up everywhere and they even shout out for your business. We didn't take time to eat on 5th. That's on the list for next time.

A very old beautiful tree was torn down so this huge mall could be built like a mini Vegas. I refuse to visit this place for what they took away from 5th Avenue. We have great memories of celebrating New Years Eves dancing on this corner of 5th. Its a sad change to see Playa Del Carmen become so commercialized with more malls and hotels every year."

A larger and wider version of Calle Hidalgo on Isla Mujeres, the district is 20+ blocks of pedestrian-only and is both charming and great for people watching.Go in the evening to avoid the midday heat and intense sun. North of Calle 12, and especially north of Ave. Constituyentes, the feel is decidedly more European and cosmopolitan. Some of the restaurants north of Constituyentes are amazing, worth checking out."

We spoke with one owner and he said he paid $7,000 US for his small location every month. So it's no wonder they have to be so expensive! The restaurants were more reasonable but still mostly nothing special. On the weekend, there were a number of very loud, drunk people at several of the restaurants so it was difficult to find a place to eat. The avenue makes for a fun evening stroll but we mainly made our purchases outside of town and our dining on little side streets."

We were never \"harassed\", as people call it, though. A firm \"no gracias\" to those we weren't interested in and we were on our way. If you are staying at a resort and have a wristband, they street hawkers will claim to be your waiter at the restaurant and try to interact with you by saying \"Are you mad at me? Why won't you talk to me? I was your waiter at so and so.\" It's quite amusing actually, especially when I hit back at them in Spanish calling them out for fibbing. The prices seemed to be quite high for everything from ice cream to margaritas. $4 American dollars for a teeny-tiny cup of ice cream. But it WAS delicious. :)There is a mixture of chain stores that one would see in the U.S. and Europe mixed in with little Mexican trinket shops, handicrafts, and well, just plain junk stores.

There's plenty to look at, and some very nice dining venues. In general, most of the restaurants in and around 5th Avenue are pricey by Mexican standards. The problem is, some of the restaurant's food quality justifies the prices and others don't. There are some very nice places to eat out and go for a drink here, I would do research on Tripadvisor and other websites beforehand however and not just wander around and look for a place, or go someplace where there is staff outside aggressively trying to bring patrons in. This is NOT a good place for shopping. Maybe its because I've been to many other parts of Mexico but the prices of the usual Mexican crafts/souvenirs are very expensive here. There are a few large shops with fixed prices in pesos, USD, and Euros (the latter two calculated at an awful exchange rate). When I was in one shop and noted that the prices are about double what I would pay for the same artisan crafts in Mexico City, I was thrown out! Many of the other smaller shops are an even worse experience. No price tags, aggressive salespeople heckling you from the street.. I would never even bother going into these places at all unless you really know what the prices of things are supposed to be. A third type of store are boutique type shops (like for clothes) and the higher end shops in the new mall on the corner of 5th and Constituyentes. These are higher end stores with fixed prices and there are NO bargains. There's nothing in this mall that could not be purchased for cheaper in the USA. The Sanborns (a well regarded Mexican chain that is a cross between a high end drugstore, book and music shop, cosmetics, perfumes, and accessories store)may be the only think worthwhile in the mall in case some necessities are needed in a pinch. The best thing about Playa, is that you only need to go a few blocks inland to get into a much more authentic Mexico. The prices come down from the rafters for booth food and shopping. The further you get from 5th avenue the more you get into the \"real\" Mexico. I recommend you do your actual buying there and leave 5th avenue for window shopping.Quick tips:-It is best to pay in pesos..Everywhere! Or everywhere outside your resort if staying at an AI. Those shops that take USD will take them at a bad rate. -Tax is already included on everything you buy and in all restaurants. -If coming from anywhere in Playacar, the taxi fare to and from the downtown of Playa del Carmen is 70 pesos, not 90 pesos, not $7. (Your hotel may have a higher rate posted on the board at the entrance. This is because there is a sitio surcharge when the taxi picks up at a hotel.) If you leave the hotel and hail a taxi, the fare is 70 pesos.This 70 pesos fare includes the entire zone of downtown Playa del Carmen. This area covers as far north as Calle 34 and as far inland as the highway, so don't let a taxi charge you more because you walked to the end of the downtown of 5th avenue and you have to pay more because you are on the \"far end\". It is still 70 pesos all the way to Calle 34"

Look, as nice as where you are staying, you will tire and need a diversion without blowing your day on a tour bus hauling you somewhere your held hostage. This is it. You can walk from many resorts or take a ten minute five buck cab here. It's legions better than it was years ago. It's twice as long as it was with shops. Sure there is shlock, but there are also some nice shops and upscale fashion stores. Low , near the bus station is the oldest and shoddiest area, and it gets better the closer you get to The Royal Hotel street and beyond. It's very safe during the day, and even at night, if you stay reasonably in the eating and shopping area. Great array of restaurants there, cheap and good change from your hotel food.If your a young gun, the bars for you are party city, but be careful, nothing good comes too late at night there.Don't talk to the street vendors, if you just ignore them, they will look to the next guy. He doesn't care where you're from...ignore him. When you see the gypsy street entertainers at night, watch your belongings, put your wallet where it's safe and hard to pickpocket. They come with the street entertainers sometimes.And while I'm here....when you get back to your all inclusive....stop tipping. Wait to your ready to leave and hit who treated you well. They serve you because...and tips shouldn't motivate them, and only spoils their expectations. People who bring cash to the all inclusive bars will change the dynamic here. Tip...at the end of your stay."

Back then the place was a run down dump. They have put a lot of money into this place since then. It really looks nice. One thing to add. Bring your bartering skills with you if you plan on shopping down there. No price is set in stone. If you want something you can get it for a good price if you are willing to work a little bit for it. It will cost you $7.00 US dollars to get there from the Playacar resorts (and $7 back to your resort). In closing one trip to 5th Ave each year is enough but it still is very fun to do and I would recommend everybody go down to Quinta Avenida."

We live in a resort town and were shocked out the outrageous prices for everything -higher than in the US. I paid $22 for sunscreen. We paid $31 at Haagen-Daz for a single scoop and a double scoop. And be sure to shop around because nothing is the same price in any of the stores. I saw the same sunscreen in another store for $17. Even the pharmacies had different prices for their stuff. It's crowded and hard to walk, there are a lot of crappy restaurants and the only thing I liked was the clubs playing house music all night. It seemed nicer and more upscale around 20th so maybe we should have stayed farther north. There wasn't anything extraordinary about it, just a street full of tourist trap stores that overcharge for their junk. Would not go to this part of Playa again."

This area is very much a tourist trap. It attracts a heavy drinking and somewhat obnoxious crowd. It is loud and overwhelming and the restaurants are generally not very good and attract the unrefined tourists. From Ave Constituyentes walking North I have consistently had a different experience.

There is art, souvenirs, bars and patios, night clubs, street performers, etc. The beach runs parallel so you have to walk it.

I personally liked to buy my souvenirs from the large stores that are premarked with prices instead of bartering all the time in the streets. Note that the further away you get from the main busy center the cheaper silver jewelry gets. Silver prices continue to rise each year I visit. Don't worry if the silver isn't polished. All the jewelry I have purchased shined beautifully when I got home with a polishing cloth. I even buy the silver overlay which is much cheaper and makes for great gifts. These don't tarnish easily.

Not only did every store sell the same thing but they were extremely pricey. Everything is priced in US dollars to make things seem cheaper. When you see that $25 is about $350 pesos you realize how expensive it is. Where I stayed in Akumal the souvenir stores there were cheaper even though almost everyone there are tourists as well. If you are expecting to find many different gifts from Mexico and at an affordable price this place is not for you. The items are all the same and the prices vary extremely. There probably was about 10 different types of things each store would have. The street itself isn't that pretty too.

Having travelled to PdC repeatedly over the years it saddens to see it be bulldosed, gentrified, and genericized. The best parts of 5th ave have been torn down to build glossy shopping malls with \"high end\" merchandise which is 10-15% marked up from prices you might pay at home.With Gentrification comes the inevitable rise in prices as well. I do not mind paying the same price for a meal in PdC as I would back in Canada but if you are charging between 4 and 5 dollars for mexican beer it had best be directly on the beach not on the 5th Ave T shirt tout strip.Luckily Fusion Bar and Grill still can deliver on that note but with PdC city doing poorly on beach erosion it may be gone in a few years. Overall I still love PdC because of the climate, the weather, and the wonderful people, but I am hunting for a new last minute winter escape destination. One that has some of the charm and character of PdC of old."

The restaurants offer cheap drinks and happy hour deals to lure you in, and the food inside these establishments is a bit pricey, but great quality.

We last visited Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue) a couple of years ago and it was all shop keepers trying to drag you in off the street, telling whatever stories (or lies) they needed to. It was pretty uncomfortable if your not into the give and take (they don't give up easily once you take the bait!).This time was much better, the shops a little more polished and little aggravation. The northern end of the street and any off streets still have that feel from the earlier trip.Good selection of shops and restaurants though you'll find almost all the same items at the same prices no matter where you go. Very few exceptions.We were looking for a \"Caterina\" doll, the \"Day of the Dead\" personage and we didn't want a cheap, papier-maiche or plastic one. Turned out to be tough to find, but find we did at a small art shop right off the town square. Very nice pieces but not cheap. We selected a smaller one (partly due to the price and partly due to his cash-only policy) but the shop keeper really knew his art and had a good selection of pieces and price ranges.The square had some entertainment in the evening from Aztec-Mayan dancers to the guys who swirl down on ropes from the top of a tower (not sure where that's from).You can spend a lot or a little here, both in time and money. Still, a good diversion after a day at the beach."

Beware of the hustlers, if you are ready for them, you can breeze on past them. The last scheme I encountered recently was them approaching me and saying \"remember me? I was your waiter at the hotel yesterday\" then they try to hook you into buying their crappy stuff. The trick is that they spot the hotel bracelet you have on. They also seem to be very skilled at spotting where you're from, anything to try to hook you into a conversation. One guy even said if I don't want souvenirs maybe I'd like pot or something harder...yikes. It's really not uncommon to get offered drugs at least once, I find it really offensive myself at the thought of how much trouble a foreigner could get into, never mind suggesting that you might be the sort of person that does drugs in the first place. For the super pushy types I don't see a problem with ignoring them, saying NO forcefully or even saying \"basta\" if they won't get out of your way. The high end shops won't push you at all. The gelato shops make any evening stroll a true delight. For those craving starbucks you're in luck, they have two of them.During the day it is nice to walk from one pier along the beach and then come back up to 5th ave and walk back along the avenue. Zenzi is one example of a great beach bar, it is by the lighthouse, wonderful nachos, relaxed atmosphere, and live music in the evenings."

Great dining to be had from the variety of restaurants but the salespeople just kill it! Especially the novelty and souvenir places, those guys are so aggressive, pushy, and at times offensive to passerby's that instead of stopping to gaze at their stuff you pretty much hurry along so that you don't get pounced on should you decide to stop in for a quick gaze.Let the people be and they will spot your stuff, I mean it's not like you don't have it halfway out on the sidewalk. It's been recently taken over my more international famous brands and its losing its Mexican allure. I would go as far as saying that tourist will not have much to see if the trend continues and it basically turns into a trip to the mall for the average tourist."

Rightfully so as its name is 5th Avenue, but more impressive is its unique assortment of vendors. Everything from tequila/liquor shops that offer free tastings (which after a couple of those who needs high priced drinks at the many restaurant/bars in the area?!), to drugstores that sell souvenirs (including tequila), to fabulous coffee shops & quaint little artisan vendors. They have all kinds of trinkets & larger items as well for taking home as a remembrance of this wonderfully unique place. Busy and bustling at times & yet cozy & SAFE. Watch your pocketbook though as you may end up buying more than you thought you would. Of course that is because you NEVER pay full asking price for anything. Remember, it is an ASKING price. Have fun &check out this place with friends or family. You will take with you not just souvenirs, but memories as well. After all, isn't that what life is made of?"

There are alot of neat things about 5th avenue - the street performers (saw a fire twirler, guys costumed as Mayans, a guy with monkeys and a guy with a lemur that you could have your picture taken with), the cobblestone streets,and the lively atmosphere. The negatives are that the prices in the shops are usually higher than on 10th avenue (the rent costs them more on 5th, I'm sure), it is somewhat of a hassle to walk down the avenue with so many merchants trying to get you to \"come see my store\" The other thing you need to know is this: if you're staying at an all inclusive and wearing a wrist band, some of the merchants will lie and tell you they were your waiter at the resort you were staying at (ie...\"hey lady, it's me Roberto, you know - your waiter from the Gran Porto Real. Come see my store.) At first, I was confused because I didn't remember him being my waiter but I couldn't figure out how he knew where we were staying. Then I remembered the wrist band. They can identify your resort from the wrist band and I heard this phrase used repeatedly - not just on me but on several others as well so beware."

One end had fixed prices and the other was happy to haggle with us for fun as well as sales. We tended to stay at this end, although I would note that prices here are still way above what you'd see in the market in downtown Cancun or Tulum. We did enjoy watching the street artists and playing with the pet monkey. In general the shopkeepers were aggressive, but not bothersome and very friendly and sociable. My husband bought a ring from one of the shops and questioned the average price for a comparable piece. The jeweler popped out his ipad and looked up comps on line and made sure my husband felt he was getting a good price. Not for good deals, but definitely good fun."

The hassle from the ADO terminal down to the ferry to Cozumel has got to be the worst part of 5th Avenue. If you are doing the ferry then go down 4th or 2nd to the beach and walk the sand; trust me! Wondering how to get out of 99% of vendor hassles? Say \"soy Russo!\" Forgive the spelling but it means \"I am Russian.\" Vendors don't speak Russian and they will say \"oh\" and wave you by. Hard to not laugh when you pull it off but wait until you are 50 feet away or they'll know you were kidding.I agree with my fellow reviewers who say buy from the side street souvenir vendors for a better price. Watch out for buying, let's say, 6 items and getting to the register and finding out there is the price you thought and the price they ring up. Do not start setting items aside; just tell them you don't want anything and nevermind. All of a sudden someone speaks English and it was just a misunderstanding. All of the larger gift shops are like this.Otherwise, enjoy the walk and browsing. Do it alt least once during the day and do not miss doing the walk at least once during the night.

If you want a little higher end stores, they have that also, but you pay more of course. Playa is no longer a 'cheap place' due to the tourism...BUT, it still is a place that you should visit if you are in the area, just to see the sights and get a little taste of the town.

It features 20+ blocks of shops, restaurants and bars along a pedestrian-only street. If you go to Playa, I encourage you to stay within walking distance of Quinta Avenida - the feel (at night, especially) is fairly European mixed with South Beach. Live music is very common, and because everyone comes together on Quinta Avendia, we've always found it to be very safe and family-friendly. A must do!"

It's a place where not only cruise ship passengers are able to explore but also those staying in the area. It's not meant for the locals for most everything on the \"strip\" is touristas. From trinket shopping to stopping someplace for a bite to eat and a cold beverage, 5th Ave. will always remain unchanged, for the most part.My only complaint is about the venders. I've spent the last 25 years traveling to Mexico and the venders have become more and more obnoxious with time. Be it screaming across the street at you to come into their store or calling you names, there is no limit to what they will do to \"entice\" you into their store. If the store has an obnoxious vender outside of it or has the music so loud I can hear myself think, I just keep on walking by. Being 99% of them have never been anywhere else in the world they don't understand that is not how to gain business. There are few other places in the world with such salesmen. I tend to shop on the off streets if I need anything at all, but mainly the only way to get be to walk the stretch is just to people watch while enjoying something cold to drink. As far as I'm concerned it's become too much like Cancun and it's overpriced. However, if you need a souvenir, this is the place to go."

Everything from \"Hey Family!! My turn to rip you off!\" to \"Hey, I have exaclty what you are looking for...\" & my favorite \"Almost Free!!\" Choose your restaurants carefully, some are cheap with good \"deals\" ($80 pesos for 3 tacos and 2 beers), but you get what you pay for in quality. I HIGHLY suggest making your way to the north side of La Quinta (north of calle 34) for better quality restaurants and shops.

The people trying to get you in to their shops do use funny lines like 'don't you remember me from your hotel?' I fell for that. My husband couldn't stop laughing at me. As an over all experience it was great, I didn't mind people trying to get you to their shops but my husband was a bit irritated by that. Shopping must be a girls thing. We got a pair of 'silver' earrings after a lot of hugging and even then we came home and noticed that the '925 sterling silver' stam was fake. We kinda new it was a possibly so weren't too disappointed but keep an eye and check and double check for the hallmark. Now the prices - that annoyed me the most. I've been to a lot of places and I have not been anywhere that charges such prices for small trinkets (fridge magnets etc) Actually the prices in general were all outrageous. I don't believe for a second that the price is anywhere near what a Mexican would pay. I understand they need to make money but I would have bought 3x the amount I did if I thought it was reasonable. Saying that, you can haggle about the prices, just can take a while and even then the prices are unreasonable. Example a lady ask for 70usd for sunglasses you can buy on a market stall for \u00a35. Or a key ring for 10usd. Maybe it's just me but it all seemed a bit steep. On a separate note: the beach is beautiful totally worth the visit too. For those who smoke: buy cigarets when going home on the plane. They were cheaper than in the shops by about 10/15usd. \u00a328 a block or \u00a324.50 if you buy two ( for Marlboro)"

I'll start by admitting that I'm one of those annoying perennial Playa visitors who say, \"you should have seen it 17 years ago, it was so rustic, so funky, so laid back..\" Playa, and expecially La Quinta, are not what they used to be and while we miss Old Playa, when Hotel Delfin was the biggest building around and early mornings meant lounging street dogs, not high-heeled young things tottering home from the clubs, we still enjoy the human parade that is 5th avenue. Find a table on the street and watch the world walk by. Play the \"where are they from?\" guessing game. Listen to the agressive salesmen run through their selection of languages, hoping you'll answer in one of them. We don't eat on 5th (except for early morning coffee at Starbucks), and we hardly shop there either, the prices are getting crazy, and you'd hardly guess you were in Mexico...but what a grand crazy scene it is. If you want a feel of old Playa, walk down 15th Av or calle 1 sur, it's still there."

I am a nice person and I hate telling people no, but the vendors are so aggressive here I eneded up avoiding all conversation with them (I REALLY HATE BEING RUDE). Definatly not like shopping in the US. You will get lines like-I am the waiter at your resort....One vendor told my friend and I to look at his store. The red flag should have went up when he took us off the street and down a dark hallway to his \"store\". I wasn't paying attention and neither was my friend and didn't notice when he started to shut the door and lock it behind us. Thank goodness one of the guys in our group followed us and put his foot in the doorway before the guy could get it all the way shut. There is a lot of bartering, which I hate to do. So, if you want to go shopping and get a great deal, take someone with you that likes to haggle. I have bought jewelry here the last three years and I have never been disappointed with a purchase. I do love to come here and buy the namebrand knockoff sunglasses. I send a person into haggle with me and when they can negotiate the price I want, I swoop in for the buy. I have never eaten here, the food is free at the resort. I have visited Senor Frog's which was fun. I've only been here during the day, and it scary enough for me. I am working on getting the nerve to visit at night....we will see how this pans out. Ladies- I felt safe travelling with big burly guys, I dont know that I would feel safe travelling without them.

There is a great variety of souvenirs and best prices at a shop on the beach side between Calle 2 y Calle 4. They take pesos, USD, Euros, whatever.

They are constantly yelling at you to come into there store, some even walk out in the road in front of you and start barking at you, some are rude when you do not and make rude comments as you walk by.

If you like Senor Frogs, this is your mecca. If you want a taste of true authenticity, travel a few blocks either side of the pedestrian walkway.

It's fun to barter for a deal on merchandise with them but remember if you can't get to the price you want, the guy next door has pretty much the same stuff so try there.Lots of the people sitting outside shops will try to sell you drugs or say they know where you can find a prostitute. After dark, the prostitutes hand out business cards by the clubs. No one was pushy about it - just a polite 'no, thanks' and they'd leave you alone. Probably not the best place for little children but maybe the offers are tamed down if there are kids around.Personally, I loved the energy of the place.

Ignore them, laugh at their terrible hawking, and move on down the strip.The people watching is fantastic, and while I may be getting scammed buying seashell jewelry for a few bucks here and there, it's just awesome and still the reason we come to Playa, stay downtown in Playa, and not at a silly all-inclusive resort or Cancun. There's a small town yet cosmopolitan feel that we've never experienced anywhere else in the world.We avoid most of the restaurants on the Avenida itself because they're mostly pretty terrible, WAY overpriced, and tourist-y. Still, the street itself is an experience that changes each day you visit and each time of day you visit. It's what you do in Playa when you're not at the beach or recouping at your hotel and makes your whole holiday! There are tons of great places to eat just a few blocks off the strip so use Trip Advisor to find those and I can guarantee you'll have a hard time vacationing anywhere else."

Avenida Quinta is great for shopping, dining, people watching, walking around, strolling or just sitting. Lights, color, music, barkers, merchandise....its all here, a virtual assault on the senses. There are hundreds of restaurants, bars and cafes. The stores lean towards cheap souvenirs, jewelry, sunglasses and beachwear but is gradually going up scale with AX, Bershka, Daniel Espinosa, Fullsand, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Liverpool, Tommy Bahama, Tommy Hilfiger, Pull & Bear, Swarovski....more brands are expected. Almost every restaurant offers outdoor or terrace dining. There really is no other place in all of Mexico quite like Avenida Quinta.....so walk from Calle 1 Sur (the ferry landing) all the way to at least 38 Norte (the avenida is growing to the north). The best and most interesting restaurants tend to be at the northern end. The first few blocks, 2 Norte, 4 Norte, up to 6 Norte tend to be the cheaper, more souvenir oriented section with flea markets and palapa style small stores selling identical merchandise. For those of you in a hurry and unwilling to try local food, there is a huger McDonalds at Av. Juarez and a Burger King at 8 Norte and a Subway just beyond that. Take your time, this is a place to wander and stoll, but rave through."

I also did not like the young panther cub I saw being manhandled for tourist pictures. There are much better places in Playa del Carmen for shopping (check out Giancarlo's at Constituyentes & 1 Avenida for quality silver). I'll go back to Playa del Carmen, but never this street again."

Of course full with tourists....but there's enough room for everybody.The Quinta Avenida is closed for traffic. Just very few sidestreets with traffic are crossing it. There's almost endless options to shop, drink and eat. Bring enough time with to enjoy it fully. There's lots of really good deals to shop. Of course, there are some places with high prices and low quality. That's why it's important to compare and not to rush in a deal. But for that you need time.The same with the Restaurants. Some places are really good...and some are the typical tourist traps. If you can do so, plan ahead a little and check in advance what places to eat and shop are worth it. But don't get me wrong...we had a great time here! We did shop some really good jewelry for quite low prices (in a small shop callled \"Silver Traditions\" around Calle 6 to Calle 8) and some nice dresses. If you look for a nice beachfront place, then the \"Fusion\" will be a great deal. There's also good Asian-Fusion Food in \"Babe's\". Great juices you'll get in \"100% Natural\". Along the Avenida there are also lots of small street shops selling Silver. But prices aren't that great and we prefered to shop in a real jewelry store. Besides shops and restaurants there are also countless small counters selling tours. And mostly they're quite annoying or agressive. We had one really bad experience close to the Ferry. If you're not interested in any tours it's best to avoid them by not giving eye contact or a firm \"No gracias\". They always try to sell \"great\" offers....half price....only today....but everday they do the same thing. At the south end, close to the Ferry and ADO Bus Station there are also (only until around 1pm) small lunch stalls serving simple, but great-tasting mexican food. Fresh and inexpensive!So, Quinta Avenida really got everything. And we loved it...even with the bad sides...but that's part of the experience. We came to stroll around here every day and it never got boring. Our Hotel was just around the Corner from the Quinta Avenida (Mosquito Blue....a good deal), so that was very convenient.There's even some baby lions and tigers to take pics with, if you're interested in that kind of thing. We surely will be back in Playa and back on Quinta.Wanna know more about my trips? Check my profile where you'll also find my website with more info about my travels."

There is also some Great restaraunts along the Quinta Aveenida, we ate at a different on every night during our stay. The food was amazingly good. We also bought lots of sovigneers to bring home.

There are a ton of bars, restaurants, hotels, resorts, clubs, coffee shops, taco stands, ect... Getting here is very easy from anywhere in Playa. There are local shops, as well as chain stores like Converse, Starbucks, Haagan Daas Ice Cream, McDonalds, ect. This place never stops. From the time the sun rises, until the wee hours of the morning there is always something to do and see here. A lot of people here in the US say Mexico is not a safe place to visit, however I was out at 2am with my 3 children and felt more safe here then I do in my own city. Mexico is safe, and I would really truly reccomend going to La Quinta if you have the opportunity of visiting Playa! :-)"
