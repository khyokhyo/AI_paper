The museum includes a visit to the merchan\u00b4t house, with its kitchen still having the original dutch tiles, the sleeping quarters (bed boxes), etc and the church hidden in the attic of the house."

Hence the family who owned this house (on the edge of the modern day red light district!) constructing a church in the attic. A fascinating insight into the life of the day and a more than interesting Tardis-like church with full altar, rows of seating and an organ. The exterior of the house holds no clue to the interior. Good commentary enhances one's understanding of life in 17th century Amsterdam."

I have been to Amsterdam several times now and each time there was one excuse or another for not making it to Our Lord in the Attic church, but this trip I made it a top priority and all I can say is that I wish I would have made it sooner. Chock full of history, this wonderfully restored canal house gives you a glimpse into the lives that have taken up residence here, specifically focusing on the 17th century restructure of the top portion of the house to contain a 3 story hidden place of worship for the local Catholics. The museum has really done an amazing job at explaining the history, showing how the rich once lived there and how the priest then lived simply, restoring the modest yet lovely church, and giving great views of old Amsterdam from the top of the house, it really is a can't-miss stop when you're in this amazing city!"

Still very much worth a visit to see the church, but I wouldn't stay as much longer as the audio guide etc. seems to be pushing you towards, unless you're especially interested or have a lot of time."

Buy a museum pass (if you're into art/museums it really can save you a lot of euros!) and then enter...At first you're in the modern section of the museum. There's a audio-visual presentation. Then put on the blue overshoes to explore the place.This is a church ---The Lord in The Attic. In the 17th Century, the country was protestant. The catholics needed somewhere to worship. The government turned a blind eye to intimate churches being created within private houses ----but there was to be no sign of such a place from outside in the street.This museum takes you through the connecting houses and up into the Church in The Attic. As you proceed, you pass through kitchens, bedrooms and day rooms and you pass your audio guide over a connection point to receive an excellent commentary. Every now and then you can view the canal or the roofscape. I really don't want to spoil it for you!Would w go again? Yes!"

I have to stay that this place is absolutely stunning. You are given at no extra charge an audio guide. Also, be aware that there a lot of stairs to climb since it is after all a church in the attic. The museum is well designed and very interesting to go through. The church itself is still being used on some occasion for mass which is quite astonishing. There is also a cafe which is a bit too cold in terms of atmosphere but still we enjoyed a coffee there. Overall, highly recommended and a must see to understand what happened to Catholics in Amsterdam."

As I've been wandering around Amsterdam for nearly a week I was running out of things to do, so I visited this museum with a mindset that I've already seen the best museums in Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum so this will probably be just okay. How wrong I was! This seemingly unassuming house houses a very charming church inside! The audio guided tour is extremely well done, telling the stories as you climb the house up to the altar without being long-winded. It was interesting to learn a bit of Dutch history here. Other than the church itself you get to see how the Dutch lives during the Golden Age in the multiple rooms and corridors inside the house. It definitely opened my eyes quite a bit! At the end of the tour you are told to go up to the second floor to check out a leaflet with a few words from the director of the museum. It was worth reading it in my opinion as the director explains how he thinks this church is the best example of Dutch tolerance.Overall I'd put this museum as being another must-see together with the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum!"

The free audio guide explains that although the city government knew of its presence, it was just a regular house from the outside, and was therefore allowed to exist. You would never know the attic was a church until you went up yourself. The stairs were steep going up to the very top, but it was so worth it! They even gave us little booties to put over our shoes so as to help maintain the structure. The house has a rich history that is well described in the audio guide. The attic church is a feat of incredible architecture and engineering to utilize even the tiniest space in the most unconventional ways."

Fascinating place for lovers of history, architecture, religion, and so on. 10 euros for an adult to go in, no Over 65 reduction but on the usual Amsterdam cards schemes so you may get some discount if you have one of those. The audio commentary was much better than the usual ones - you just pointed your machine at each info point and then listened to it like a phone - no yucky headphones! Just enough info , with more depth if required. Lots of climbing narrow stairs which I found a bit difficult as I don't like heights or winding staircases although I don't have any physical disabilities. The cafe looked good, but as there's no air con in the building (and I didn't expect it in a building of such age) we left at the end of our tour and had a drink outside nearby. Free lockers in which to leave your bags. Toilets clean. I will definitely recommend as it's so unusual and different."

The church itself is impressive for the number it can cater for (still functions as a real church on Sundays) and, yet, when looked at from the outside you cannot tell what lies within. Yes, this was as impressive as the two other famous museums in this city but in a different way. Do visit."

The church is located on the top 3 floors of 3 connecting houses. It is not necessary to be Catholic to enjoy the artifacts from this period and to appreciate the challenges of worshiping in your chosen religion. Located near the Old Church and the red light district, it is certainly worth 1 or 2 hours of exploration."

It was built and operated in secrecy by a wealthy businessman in the years that Catholicism was illegal. The interior church is surprisingly high and capacious (seats about 100), and very church-like, due to the hollowing out of a number of canal houses which sit side by side. This is the very next thing you need to see after the old favourites of Ann Frank House, Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, etc."

Altogether very engaging - has a good little cafe too."

We had a great trip to Amsterdam, but unfortunately the more famous museums and galleries had very long queues and, as we were there in March, it was a bit cold for outdoor queuing. But every cloud has a silver lining. We bought the Amsterdam City Card which included free entry to many other attractions that we probably wouldn't otherwise have seen. One of these was the \"Our Lord in the Attic\" church museum. I love the Amsterdam canal houses, so this was a great treat. The church was so much bigger than I expected .....and even after I had seen it, I still couldn't believe it was in the attic - impossible to tell from outside the house. But that was the reason it was built in the first place, in the 1600s, as Catholics had lost the right to attend mass. This museum is well worth seeing."

Forcing Catholics to worship in secret was a ridiculous idea, but this museum showed you it really happened in history. You don't have to be religious to visit this place. Indeed, its ultimate message is that we should tolerate, accept and respect other people's religious beliefs. A pleasant and thought provoking visit."

We visited on a Tuesday just after opening ,so there were only a few other tourists there. The museum is right on the canal side and easy to find since the addition of a new entrance. Step through the glass and tile reception, return the smiles and greetings from the staff; and step back in time to another word and another time.The 'Dear Lord' is a treasure trove for all kinds of visitors. Those who love architecture and the beautiful functionality of old Dutch buildings; those who relish history and like to follow countless footsteps over the 500 year old floorboards (you are given overshoes to protect the woodwork), and stand and look out on a view shared by those who lived there in times past. Romantics will be captivated by the hidden stairways and the clandestine meetings.The scale of the church in the attic is such a surprise, actually being across three attic spaces.The paintings are superb and there are clear and interesting explanations on the excellent audio commentary. The attention to detail in the restoration is superb , the colour of the paint, the hand woven rug, the bed linen and the artefacts found under the house all breath life into the experience, and let us see how the masters and maids used to live.There are things to consider before you go; if you are not good on your feet there are steep and twisty stairs to negotiate (especially if you go up into the organ loft and the warehouse) if you are tall, lots of spaces will require stooping a little and if you have young children they will probably not be as engaged as you are!If you are captivated, read Russell Shorto's book 'Amsterdam' or the novel 'The Miniaturist '."

The history behind why Catholics were resorting to churches in attics is well covered and it is interesting to see an example of a canal house. But obviously, the real attraction is the church, which is quite impressive. It looks just like a full sized church, but on a much smaller scale across three little floors in this house. The altar is lovely and the way the pulpit pulls out of one of the columns is ingenious. I really enjoyed the museum. It isn't huge so you can visit it in about an hour and it is right in the central part of the city, so very easy to fit in with other touristy type activities. The entrance fee of 10 euros seemed a little high, but you do get a free audio guide that works well and would be very necessary if you can't read Dutch or English."

The technicalities of Amterdam's celebrated policy of 'toleration' are adroitly explained, and the hidden chapel on the top floors reinforces the point beautifully.

This little museum is actually quite restful and you can go at an unhurried, relaxed pace. Massively preferable! It's a bit of a warren so I think it does take quite a bit of time to get round it, with the audio guide giving you plenty of information. It's really fascinating - not just the church, but a bit of history of Amsterdam, architecture, commerce...There are also these little stickers on some things which I think is part of the childrens' trail, so you can open some cupboards and doors and see secrets. Like jars with some herbs and spices in so your kids can have a fun game smelling cinnamon or pepper. Kids. Yes. Definitely not two full grown adults.Tot ziens Museum Ons'Lieve Heer Op Solder!"

The church was created out of the top three floors of three connected canal houses and is amazing. There are some very steep staircases to climb when touring the buildings but if you can manage to get up them, a modern addition has been added on to the back of the building so you are able to use regular stairs or an elevator to get back down. It is definitely worth the effort of getting up the original staircases to view the church at the top!"

Back in the time of the Reformation, the Dutch government would not let religions other than the Dutch Reform Church practice openly. At that time the Dutch government confiscated the Catholic church buildings and synagogues. So people had to practice their faith wherever they could gather in private. There were many churches in homes established and Our Lord in the Attic is the oldest. It is just amazing!

If you can cope with the stairs, you'll enjoy the history, the enfolding personal stories and the well-preserved artefacts.The museum starts in a minimalist basement, but then it leads to room after room of history preserved from the time of religious persecution. The kitchens, the living rooms, the priest's room and most of all the church in the attic give a sense of how the \"underground\" Catholic Church continued to worship through a repressive regime. There's a reminder too that it wasn't just the Catholics that suffered: the Anabaptists, the Baptists, the Arminians and other non-mainstream religious groups had to find shelter in times of persecution, and Amsterdam was a place where non-conformity thrived.The details are fascinating, like the way the pulpit folds out from the altar and the time sacristy, and the use of the tiny space to accommodate so many people. It's all presented clearly with a good commentary and there's more to see here than you'd expect."

Frankly, I have never seen anything like this, and the museum presentation is top quality. We found it totally enthralling and raved about it afterwards. Definitely visit!"

Best that way, if you know about the path of the sun or how the city is a series of half circles extending away from the old harbour.No I was not looking for God or the Red Light District but found them both in a sort of quiet unity. From its birth Amsterdam has been a Protestant city. They did not want discord and were to varying degrees tolerant of other peoples beliefs. But they objected to hearing them pray. It was the Roman Catholics that they could not stand the ringing of bells, Latin chanting and possibly the smell of incense, so the old Burghers decided that such people had to hide away from the general public,This house, recently extended is one such place. The rooms are small as was typical. Hidden away are Priests holes as found in England. Great to climb the stairs and wonder how people lived in such small places, until one thinks carefully about the tiny rooms of modern English starter homes.Carry on climbing the stairs and then be amazed at a complete Church built from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and timber. The surfaces are marbled. Everything one sees is of a miniature Catholic church. High up towards heaven the small congregation could sing their hearts out.Close by is a much larger church, In front of its entrance please seek out a brass plaque and admire the picture you see. It could be a message for the traveler of other heavenly pleasures. But then for me what is known as the Redd Light district is a water way with some splendid elegant houses. A good place to live one might think.A place for the intrepid traveler not to miss."

What a Change!!The new entrance, ticket area elevators and cafe, were terrific, also very nice locker area with very clean WC. They now ask for you to wear bootie like covers over your shoes, good idea because the day we were there it was quite damp and rainy. They have rush mats in one area so to damage those, and of course other areas, it was a good idea. My only complaint, was a German Tour Group - was visiting and their Guide (not sure if she was affiliated with the Museum or was from and outside Tour Group, was very noisy, She spoke so loudly and spread her small group out to you had to go around them at each location. Also you receive, Audio headset, which was very informative and yet the Tour Group was SO LOUD - it was necessary to put your hand over your ears to hear the comments offered on the audio guide!! You need to be rather mobile to visit (with all the narrow stairs - which can be expected - would be very difficult to see all that is offered. Would definitely recommend this lovely well preserved Museum."

At first glance it appears to be a couple of typical Amsterdam town houses, however it is not until you have climbed lots of wooden stairs that you arrive at the hidden gem - a church built across the attic space of 3 houses. Known by the English name of The church in the attic. This came about when Catholics were banned from openly celebrating mass in the 1600 & 1700's but a blind eye was turned if it wasn't seen publicly! This is an incredible piece of building work & architecture & needs to be seen to appreciate just how hidden it is. Well worth climbing the stairs to the top of the building!"

The English translation for this museum is \"The Church in the Attic.\" In the 1660's, Holland announced that its official religion was the Dutch Reformed Church (Protestant), and while other religions were not illegal, they couldn't be practiced in public. A number of faiths constructed clandestine churches, and this one has survived and been renovated to splendid condition. Its a normal Amsterdam building of the time, except that the top three floors have been converted into a church, invisible from the street. The museum includes very interesting trips into some of the \"normal\" rooms of the period (kitchen, formal room, bedrooms), and then the church. They have a very good audio guide in multiple languages, and you can explore the whole thing in an hour. We really enjoyed it. It isn't one of the places you hear about, but well worth your time.One more thing. Be sure to go to the very top, where the large pulley wheels that operate the exterior hoists are--they are cool to see!"

Not only do you get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to visit a typical Amsterdam canal house here, but you get to experience stepping in a well-preserved / restored \"hidden church\". Back in the 16th-18th centuries, Catholics were banned from displaying ostentatious gestures of their religion due to the dominance of Protestanism. However, since the owner of this canal house was wealthy and had business ties with the city, he was allowed to convert the upper floors of his house as a secret sanctuary for practicing Catholics. The audio-guide was free and expertly narrated. Don't miss the attic and the hidden pulpit. I used my Museumkart here. Virtually no lines. 5-7 minute walk from Central Station. Lovely canal-side location, tucked in the middle of the Red Light District. Highly-recommended!"

The museum of Our Lord in the Attic (Ons' Lieve Heer op Solder) is one of those things that may not be at the top of people's to-do lists in Amsterdam, if at all. Although we knew of it, it wasn't on ours. We went in because we happened to be in the area and had some time that we hadn't planned out. It was definitely worth it!There are four great reasons to go inside this museum:You get to see what it was like inside a seventeenth century Amsterdam house of belonging to a family of modest means. Experience what its like climbing the tiny winding steps and living in the intimate spaces of a canal house, and peek inside cabinet beds and cozy tiled kitchens. Behold the church in the attic. Although there are pictures online, they really do not prepare you for what its like when climbing through the rest of the dimly lit house, you finally arrive at the very beautiful little church built within the attic. It really is surprising and simply stunning. Have a seat in the pews and take it all in. Learn some fascinating and well explained history of the house, church, and its inhabitants, and also about Dutch attitudes and tolerance regarding religion in the 17th century. Audio guides are included in the museum price. Lastly, take pictures! The space within the house is minimal and fills up quickly, and you'll want to be mindful of others, but if you are lucky, you can take some wonderful portrait photos in the beautiful Vermeer-like light that comes in through the windows. Also, there are terrific views from this house, so grab some shots of the canal and surrounding houses from here. Views you can't get any other way. Really, this was a high point of our trip. A genuine surprise. Although its \u20ac10 per adult, we felt it was worth the price and a better value than some of the other attractions you'll find in town. Admission is also free with the museum and I Amsterdam cards. In short, if this isn't on your to-do list, put it there. I think you'll be glad you did."

Can get busy.The audio-guide is handy and activated by posts on each room. Information centre provides an overview of the site and then leads to the actual house by a tunnel. The first few floors are reconstructions of the living quarters over the years and are an interesting insight to life in old Amsterdam. The jewel in the crown is the chapel itself. After the relative austerity of the living area, the chapel is a stunning revelation. The work required to create the chapel in secrecy is astounding and it is a wonderful sight. The stairs and layout are a bit convoluted and it is hard to visualise the house layout. A bit more information and graphics in the information centre would be useful.Tip: Visit the nearby Protestant church in it's austerity to accentuate the effect of the chapel itself.T & S."

Apparently many people built churches in their attics - but this one luckily was saved vs. renovated to make room for some modern living area.All the details and the history behind this unique museum was well-maintained and produced.

Some museums can leave you elated, perhaps because of a specific focus, or the taste of an individual collector; others worthy but weary, however interesting the highlights: Van Gogh v Rijksmuseum, perhaps. This hidden church in a merchant's houses falls squarely in the first category; I haven't been this impressed by a historical attraction in a long while. The short version of the audio guide - I passed on the additional detail - is perfectly pitched, and the final comment from the museum's Director quite moving. If a paper copy's not available onsite, make sure you read the short speech on 'Voices of Tolerance' by Russell Shorto, given there on 22 September 2015; it might even change your life a little! Oh, and the cafe is a calm place to reflect upon what you've just learned."

After the Reformation in 1578, Amsterdam became a Protestant city. In typical Amsterdam style, other religions were tolerated just as long as they kept themselves to themselves and worshipped only in private houses. Hence this Catholic church was constructed in the top floors of several interlinked canal houses.The rooms throughout the house are very atmospheric - kitchens lined with blue Delft tiles, bedrooms with closet-beds and a beautifully furnished parlour. At the top of the house is the church, complete with organ and altar. There are several big windows at the top of the house with great views out over the canals and the Amsterdam skyline.The new entrance to the historic house with the church in the attic is through a modern entrance next door. This provides extra space for cloakrooms, a small shop, a bright and welcoming cafe and extra exhibitions. A good audioguide is provided (available in many different languages) and a short informative film is screened before entering the house itself. When returning back into this basement room there is a window to view the foundations of the house - proof that the whole city really is built on timber piles. No wonder so many canal houses look a bit tipsy!All together an informative experience and a tribute to Amsterdam's history of tolerance. Amazing to see the interactive display showing just how many 'secret' places of worship (not just Catholic) were scattered across the city.This museum is open at 10.00 on Monday mornings - a quiet time, when not much else is open, so a good time to visit."

Amsterdam is a city known for tolerance, and perhaps no museum in the city helps to put this into perspective like the Our Lord in the Attic Museum. At a time when Catholicism was illegal, wealthy canal house owners banded together to create a secret church in their attics. Officials probably knew, but they chose to turn the other cheek. The idea that this city once banned a religion and now accepts everyone openly and on his/her own merits provides valuable context for this unique city. This museum helps to demonstrate the roots and origins of Amsterdam's modern day tolerance. It's a special place that evokes special feelings. Although not one of the larger tourist attractions in the city, it really shouldn't be missed."

At that point I was ready to leave. But then you watch an introductory video and get transported into a 17th century Catholic hidey hole and the journey is fantastic. You are furnished with an audio guide that you really do need in order to fully appreciate the history of this gem. This is not just a place of worship. It is a guide to old Dutch life and society. It is a study of faith. It is a picture postcard of beauty. It is an art gallery. My favourite part was the main chapel. You can see on the balustrade, the different colours that it has been painted over the years. There is an awe-inspiring painting of the Baptism of Jesus behind the altar and I will leave you to find out where the pulpit is. Very economical in those times!After you exit the main building you have the option of visiting a museum with unusual artefacts and art which I recommend. All in all a beautiful place to visit."

I think this is a very special place to see when visiting Amsterdam, not to mention the location of this museum..in the middle of the red light district...with a lot to see, too many good restaurants and bars and a lot of fun around you."

It tells the story of a wealthy catholic trader who builds a secret place of worship for local Catholics in the top 3 floors of his house. The audio tour is first rate, and although you are expecting it, the attic church is still quite shocking and magnificent. The church was one of over 30 similar secret places of worship which were allowed to function undercover. Ironically it became redundant when religious tolerance meant the large St Nicholas Church was built nearby. Ironic because St Nicholas is the patron saint of prostitutes and this is on the edge of the red light district. Recommended."

The church is the highlight, and it was far larger, and more impressive, than we thought it would be. The stairs are fairly steep in places, though we had no problems, and we're in our 70s. On the way out there's a modern part (actually in the building across the alleyway which runs alongside the house) with a nice cafe and clean modern toilets.Despite the lack of publicity, there were a fair number of visitors the day of our visit, so clearly it's well known.A slight negative : at some points there are video displays, and these are placed alongside the audioguide \"scanning\" points.

The main part to see in the house is the Catholic Church that was built on the top 3 floors of the canal house. The Church was hidden from the public due to Catholics not being able to worship publicly due to Dutch laws. Besides the Church, the rest of the museum is the former canal house that shows you what it was like to live in the 1600s in Amsterdam. Remember to save your ticket receipt because this can give you a combideal for 3 euros off at a couple other unique museums in Amsterdam: Amsterdam Museum, Cromhouthuizen - Bijbels Museum,Geelvinck Hinlopen Huis or Museum Willet-Holthuysen.

The church is unique as its been built into the top floors of three buildings and is interesting in how they used the space. You can get some nice views across the canal and amsterdam rooftops from the top floors. You have a audio guide which gives useful information. You cant take your backpack but there are lockers to leave these at next door where you buy your entry ticket and there is also a toilet available. They are currently making access into the third house which was not open. But beware as there are no signs for this attraction on the building that the church is in and so we walked past it and only found it as there was a ticket attendant standing outside."

This small museum gives an excellent impression on the ideas about religion in the 17th century after Amsterdam made the turn to Protestantism from being a highly religious Catholic city before that. It is called the Alteratie in Dutch and it happened not gradually but with a shock. The Catholics had to go \"underground\" but were able to celebrate in hidden churches after that date. Only in the 19th. century Catholicism returned on the foreground of Dutch live again. Something that resulted in some exuberant Catholic churches in Amsterdam like Krijtberg on Singel and Jacob Obrecht church in the South of Amsterdam near Van Gogh. But there are many others that reflect the revival of Catholicism as an accepted religion of the higher classes in Amsterdam. However in the days of this church it was still necessary to hide the church behind the front of a normal looking house"

My parents had been here in April and recommended that we see it. It was hard to find, so we had been searching for a while. It was under construction, so that was part of the problem. They should not close early-ever. It is not fair to the tourist who travel 5000 miles to see it."

Not known to a lot of people this is a unique museum dealing with the practice of the Catholic religion while it was banned in the Netherlands in their Golden Period. It is as it was, a church built within a traditional home owned by a wealthy Catholic. Once in there and on the second floor you are in a somewhat small, but complete church with an alter, organ and pews. The middle of two more upper floors has been cutout to provide a view from tiered seats. All is beautifully done. The remaining areas of the house are also on exhibit - a very interesting kitchen and private rooms, etc. This is way more interesting than one might anticipate, and certainly not limited in interest to those of the Catholic faith."

Interested in the history of Amsterdam, we went to the Amsterdam Museum (city history) and two canal houses (van Loon and Geelvinck) and Our Lord in the Attic on the same day. The two canal houses showed a pretty grand side of life--each has a lovely garden and a coach house--but were restored to 19th century furnishings. Each is privately owned and the top floors are used for offices and private apartments for the owners. Geelvinck has the nicest garden and van Loon includes a coach in the coach house and more interior furnishings; van Loon has more rooms open. Our Lord in the Attic showed more about life in the 17th century plus it has the remarkable church in the attic and a very easy and useful system of imparting information in the (included in the admission price) audio tour. There's some kind of discount if you visit all three, but we didn't learn about that until late in the day at our last stop (Lord in the Attic). There's apparently an open garden day earlier in June across the city and if we'd known about that, we might have come a week or so earlier. It was June 20/21 this year and would be worth trying. Our Lord in the Attic has a LOT of up and down narrow stairs, including one original 17th century oak staircase that is short and still quite lovely to see."

It is quite hard to find as there is construction equipment around it and it is not prominently sign posted. You need a big map with the map clearly marked. It is on the same street by a canal as the Ould Kirche - just a little further towards the harbour.Yes there is renovation happening but this is mainly connected to the work on the adjoining house where all the support services are going to be shifted to. The First and second storeys of two houses are the living quarters of the Hartmann family and the priest respectively. However it is the church on the third floor that is the real attraction. It is surprisingly large, beautifully decorated and restored. As well as the striking altar and its surrounds, there is a charming pipe organ at the other end. It has rooms connected with Catholic worship - a sacristy with old vestments and confessional boxes. It also has the sacred vessels used for the celebration of Mass. The audio guide is activated at each point and is really easy to use."

As you go inside there just endless bedrooms and so forth then suddenly you come to this tiny church with a wonderfully decorated altar at the back. Small but all elements of catholic worship are present - the roman missal, the crucifix, other religious figures - just as complete and elegant as any major church in Europe! It struck us so hard that the builder went to extreme lengths just to provide a place of worship at times of persecution. It's all for a good price and it's free if you have an iamsterdam card, and its located right at the heart of the infamous red light district so it's not difficult to get there."

Ons' Lieve Heer op Solder (\"Our Lord in the Attic\") is a touching religious curio, and as a testament to the endurance of secret faith, sometimes seems to offer a faint echo of that most famous of hiding places in Amsterdam, the Anne Frank House. That, of course, is a must-see; this is perhaps a minor attraction, but one that lingers in the mind with its own poignance. The clandestine Catholic sanctuary was built in secret on the upper floors of a canal house in the late seventeenth century, when the Dutch Reform Church forbade public Catholic worship. There is no great art to be seen here (and the surrounding house museum is of only mild interest), but the \"nave\" and altar are somehow lovely, and surprising in their length, height and ornateness even when one expects them (there's even a tiny pipe organ at the back, which makes you wonder just how secret the services could have been!). Given that Hitler was a conservative Catholic, there are historical ironies at play here that give the visitor much to ponder; yet the overall effect is one of gentle, enduring piety. The faithful might be interested to learn that masses are still said in the space on Sunday mornings."

It's absolutely fascinating and has real parallels with Wolverhampton's SS Peter & Paul's Catholic Church. Well worth a visit and an opportunity to take a step back time and experience a little peace."

The included audio tour walks you through each floor of the house with stops in some of the merchant family's living areas before climbing the stairs to the church, which takes up the top three levels. You can climb up into the top galleries and explore the priest's living quarters. You must put on booties that cover your shoes and protect that thatching on the floor which makes navigating the stairs even more interesting. Overall, a nice visit. I probably read too much about it in guidebooks because I didn't learn much about the site that I didn't already know, but I still enjoyed seeing it in person. We listened to every prompt on the audio tour and took many pictures and finished in 50 minutes. Included as part of the Museumkaart."

And the research that was/is happening to renovate this space back to its glory is so interesting.

It's an odd title perhaps, but one of the things I learned in Amsterdam's reformation history is that unlike other parts of Europe, Dutch Calvinists were not much interested in persecuting non-Calvinists, especially Catholics. As long as you were discreet and practised your faith quietly, the local council was content to let you be. The Church of Our Dear Lord in the Attic is a complete Catholic Church of the 17th century built inside a merchant's house in the centre of Amsterdam. It reflects the piety and religious practice of the counter-reformation and also shows that the tolerance of the Calvinist establishment was fact. It is not a small chapel, but a big church on three levels. There are plans underway to enlarge and expand the museum and education wings. I was impressed by the excellence in presentation, the care to ensure that visitors see a well-preserved piece of Dutch Catholic history and the care and good humour of the staff. I left my ear muffs at the museum - the staff ensured I got them back and graciously ensured someone was in the museum when I called back the next day - 20 minutes before catching the train to Munich! Thank you!"

The visitor goes smoothly throughout all the floors of this old house, in which a secret church was build, so the Catholics of the 17th century (if I am not mistaken), could practice their religion. Moreover, one can have a true idea of how a typical house from the Golden Age looks like from its inside. Enjoy your tour through the \"Our Lord in the Attic\"!"

The church itself is beautiful, as are several small spaces devoted to religious life, including the room the priest would prepare in and a small chapel devoted to Mary. Also striking are the living spaces for both the family of the merchant and the priest, illustrating what home life was in those days.The audio tour was great, included in the price of admission, and the staff there were some of the most welcoming we had encountered and we had encountered some pretty nice people.

This is a memorable museum, currently being renovated and expanded.It is so interesting to understand the context for the chapel, contained in the attic of this canal house.There is an interesting audio tour and the house has recently been restored. We were lucky enough (I would not usually enjoy being there with a student group) to hear secondary school students making presentations about the chapel for an assignment - it provided interesting background for us. There is quite a good little shop, too.However, construction is underway, and there will be a passage to connect it to another house, on the other side of the adjacent alley. The 2nd house will contain the office and shop, plus explanatory exhibits. So, once the work is finished, the current building space will just be for visitors to see the restored canal house and the chapel within.This was a museum like none I've seen - maybe the entrance price was a bit steep for what's currently on offer, plus a few things were off-limits due to renovation work. But ultimately I didn't begrudge it and I'm glad we visited.It's on the edge of the red light district and quite near the central station - so fairly easy to find."

This museum is a double depth canal house owned by a wealthy Catholic in a time when Catholicism was banned in the city.

You will be impressed by the spirit of this place. In 1661 the wealthy merchant Jan Hartman (1619-1668) bought a prestigious property on Oudezijds Voorburgwal; comprises a house on the canal and two rear houses, with the third floor of the front house forming a single extended attic. On the first floor he added a lavish reception room to show off his status and receive guests. This salon is among the best preserved living rooms of the Dutch Golden Age, a copy of which can be seen in Japan. In Protestant Amsterdam Catholics were prevented from openly practising their religion. Within years of the Alteration (the transfer of power in Amsterdam to Protestants in 1578) an official prohibition on the celebration of the Catholic mass was issued. Hartman therefore decided to convert the top three floors of his house into a secret Catholic church. For over two hundred years Hartman's attic served as a parish church for Catholics in the city centre. Of course the Protestant authorities knew about the hidden church, but they turned a blind eye. When the large St Nicolas's church opposite Central Station was dedicated in 1887, Our Lord in the Attic was superseded as the local parish church. In that same year a group of Catholics in Amsterdam bought the property on the corner of Oudezijds Voorburgwal and Heintje Hoekssteeg, thus saving it from demolition. A year later, on 28 April 1888, Our Lord in the Attic was opened to the public on weekdays. After the Rijksmuseum it is the city's oldest museum.The combideal gives you a \u20ac 3,- discount on the adult entrance fee at the following museums: Amsterdam Museum, Cromhouthuizen - Bijbels Museum, Geelvinck Hinlopen Huis or Museum Willet-Holthuysen. My advice is to visit (Museum Willet-Holthuysen) in order to fully appreciate the typical 17th & 18th century canal houses of Amsterdam."

Also nice to see an attraction in Amsterdam which isn't completely overrun with tourist (or perhaps we had luck with our timing).Note: Not recommended for those with mobility issues as there are narrow stairs."

There is a great audio tour which I always enjoy. The church is beautiful and they do a great job explaining to you how it was used. The tour also takes you through the house and discusses the everyday living areas and how they would have been used. This is a great way to see how the narrow homes in Amsterdam look on the inside from a layout perspective. Definitely put this one on your list!There are very narrow steps so be prepared as it is not crowded you have plenty of time to take them slowly."

This is a very special place, a 17th-century wealthy Amsterdam catholic's house in which a catholic church had been constructed in the upper floors at a time of toleration that nonetheless forbad public displays of catholic worship. It was fascinating to explore, helped by an excellent audio guide (something we don't normally use but which was indispensible here). It made a fascinating hour and reaching the church at the tope, and exploring it and the priest's dwelling, was a very special experience. There is major restoration work going on, and a new entrance under construction. I don't know how much that interfered with the visit, and I hope that it doesn't become too slick and busy, but even with the works going on it was a marvellous place to visit."

Some of the rooms have little box beds, beds built into the wall. I think I would have liked to sleep in them.

The Dutch today are famously known for their liberal attitudes on alternative culture, prostitution, soft drugs (marijuana and herbal drugs), and euthanasia. However, the history of this counter culture is only about 50 years old. Before this there was WWII, and before that (150 odd years ago) Catholicism was actually banned in Holland. The Dutch have a history of the terror of what oppression does and how intolerance never leads to good in society. This museum highlights how even though oppressed people still ere willing to risk everything for their faith and beliefs. This unassuming \"row house\" of a 17th Century Dutch Merchant (make sure to look out for the small and almost mistakable sign) hides a fascinating secret. When Catholicism was banned for a time in the 1700's a congregation of Dutch Catholics built a hidden chapel in an attic. You will first visit the restored mansion of the merchant who allowed the congregation to dwell in his attic. Next you will climb unassuming steep steps up to this hidden gem. The audio-guide will help you understand the history and reasoning behind the congregation and their place of worship. You do not need to be Catholic to grasp the importance of this place. It still has a congregation and the adjacent building is currently being worked on (the admission price will help with this project) for additional museum space in the next year or two. So, some of the artifacts are not on display at the time. However, when they are the museum will be even more informative than it is now. Defiantly worth a visit."

Built across the roof spaces of three typical Amsterdam houses (a small footprint, but very tall) the church was constructed as a clandestine meeting place for those of the Catholic persuasion (although it seems that the then city fathers, having deprived the Catholics of their lavish, decorated former possessions and outlawing them, turned a blind eye to such places just so long as they were out of sight!). The Catholic Businessman who funded and built the place (and it must have cost a bomb) as a result bequeathed to his family substantial debts, but to prosperity a little gem!It's quite amazing: a church on three galleried levels inside such a small place. And well preserved: the place became a museum when it ceased to be a church (in the late 1800s), and preserved alongside are the kitchens and living quarters of priests and subsequent curators. There's a lot of building work going on at the moment to improve access, but in fact the information provided (handsets in a choice of languages that would rival the tower of Babel) is thorough, well-presented and interesting.

The Lord in the Attic is 3 houses that were bought by a business so that he could create a church for Catholics to worship in. The town council knew that this type of church existed but turned a blind eye - business was more important than principle :) There are lots of steep stairs and 3 floors to tour. Very good job of showing history in a visual way."

There are steps but although steep, I did not find this a problem and I am an older female that is not ready to run a marathon by any means. One of the museums included with the museumkart, which if you are a lover of museums and plan on spending more than 4 days in the Dam, this is just ideal and will save you money and time(no standing in lines in most places)"

Once you get to the attic the realisation of a beautiful church lovingly built to worship a religion over 3 houses with the threat of persecution really is worth it.The church has been restored to a period in the 1600's in a purple colour and it really suited it with the gold a perfect contrast. It is a good place to sit and reflect.

However my friend found it boring while i thought it was pretty cool to stand in the rooms same as how they looked 300 years ago."

A hidden church which is as old as 400 yearsReally enjoyed visiting this interesting hidden church. Though the church isnt lavish and very beautiful but the plain look makes it more authentic. The cost of this attraction is EUR 8.00. It includes free audio guide which is very helpful. The stairs are bit high and narrow, so please be careful. Me and my family were really impressed. Though this attraction was primarily a time-killing site for us. But we were very much engaged upon our visit."

Upon entering you are presented with a (free) audio guide which you scan in every room. These audio excerpts were concise while providing interesting facts and a clear picture of the church at the height of its use. I really enjoyed visiting Our Lord in the Attic and would certainly return in the future when renovations are complete(not that these in any way hindered today's tour)."

The church itself is spectacular, but when you consider that this is one of many hidden churches, from part of history where Catholics were not able to openly hold mass, and that it lies across three attic spaces in adjoining houses, it becomes more and more interesting. The audio tour (included in the ticket price and available in many languages) was fantastic, and is activated at specific points of interest. Guests are encouraged to wander wherever they please, which feels great.The museum is currently expanding - the ground work for a new building was underway during our visit, so I think this attraction will have even more to offer in the future. We found it very interesting, and would recommend it to fellow history-seekers :)"

A very interesting overview of the history of intolerance and discrimination against Catholics in Amsterdam -- they give you headphones and as you walk through the three floors of the church, there are stops along the way where you can listen to a couple minutes about the church or its founder.The story of how the church came to be, how the government looked the other way because Catholics churches were illegal in the Netherlands at the time, and then how more tolerant view eventually made the church obsolete. It's been restored to the way it looked in the 17th century, which is simple but still nice.Listening to all the narrated versions takes about an hour and a half, but you could get the general idea in less."

It remains much as it was then, including the purple paint-job. It is still used occasionally for services and is in the process of expanding into the house next door.

Originally this area was one of the smartest addresses in Amsterdam during the Golden Age. It is one of the few remaining Catholic attic churches left, as years passed, the buildings which housed these churches have either been remodelled or demolished.This property has been lovingly restored; in particular the attic church where small patches of the different colours that the church has been painted over the years have been left. After much discussion it was decided to restore it to the original colours. So we have a lovely home, which in typical Dutch style has numerous sets of very narrow steep stairs to climb before you reach the church.From the museum reception I then followed the markers up a set of narrow stairs to the parlour. The room has a fireplace with twisted columns of black marble on either side. There are a number of paintings on the walls, and apparently the painting over the fireplace \u201cThe Presentation in the Temple\u201d has hung here since the time of the original homeowner; Jan Hartman. The ornate ceiling; arranged in squares is reflected in the floor, which is white marble bordered by black. Ascend another small spiral staircase to reach the Canal Room\u201d, in here is a black cabinet with the Prodigal Son story painted on it \u2013 something a bit different. From here there is a sort of corridor which has small shell font of Holy Water on one wall, continue climbing more stairs, as you exit the stairs you are in the Church. Looking toward the lovely baroque altar which has a painting by Jacob de Wit entitled \u201cThe Baptism of Christ\u201d behind it. Although, dependant on the time of year you visit, there may be another painting hanging there as the Church has 3 other paintings which they rotate.Notice the metal rods that span the width of the Church. These are necessary to support the galleries and prevent the walls from moving inwards after part of 2 floor levels were removed to create the soaring height of the Church. This would have been quite and engineering feat when it was completed. The area behind the altar is utilised to house the 3 rotating altar paintings and has a Lady Chapel with a lovely statue of Mary and Jesus dating from late 1600s or early 1700s. Ascending another level brings you to the first gallery; from a window on this level from the right hand side of the church over the rooftops is the spire of the \u201cnew\u201d St Nicholas Church. This church was built to accommodate the Catholic worshippers when religious freedom attained. On the left hand side is the spire of the Old Church which was the original main Catholic Church but became a Protestant Church during the Reformation. So at one point in time if you stood in Our Lord in the Attic Church you would have been in the present, and seen the past (the Old Church) and the future (St Nicolas\u2019). I think that\u2019s pretty incredible! On the first gallery level is the original organ, which still works. There is also a collection of ecclesiastical silverware and clothing. Some richly embroidered.The climb to the second gallery is via a very narrow set of stairs. Be warned that there is only one way up and down. Descending from the galleries to the main church level, the stairs which are near the Lady Chapel go down to the confessional. On this level the wooden floors look very old. I do remember being told that there are still some of the original wooden stairs and floors dating from 1660s, unfortunately I can\u2019t remember which ones.More stairs lead you to the Leeuwenberg room at the end of the room a very steep set of stairs lead to the 17c and 19c kitchens. Stone floors in the kitchen made from white Italian marble and black Belgian marble (original from 1660s).I found this a really interesting museum. Although it was undergoing renovations, I didn\u2019t feel that it detracted from the sights and enjoyment of the building. It is wonderful that such a unique part of Dutch history is preserved.If mobility is a problem then the stairs may proved too much of a challenge.Allow about an hour, perhaps a bit more if you really like to check everything out, or would like to have some quiet meditation time.Free entry with Museumkaard, otherwise E9.00 I think. Audio included in price.Lockers available.Photos allowed; no flash.Open Mon to Sat 10.00am to 5.00pm and Sunday 1.00pm to 5.00pm"

A modern visitors centre will open next year (2015) to lead visitors into it, but we were told this won't change the way you climb the steep stairs through 3 stories of a merchant's house, seeing on the way how his family lived in the 1600s. Then emerging into a soaring church built to accommodate 100 worshippers. We then thought we'd seen all there was only to discover there was even more to see on the way down - so give this plenty of time - it's a 2 hour visit if you like to take your time to look.

Would I go again? Absolutely! Would I go back to the ground floor kitchen? No, thank you!"

I had been recommended this attraction by an old school friend who lives in Amsterdam but I am surprised it does not feature more in some of the attraction books and maps. Essentially, the chapel was built over the top 3 floors of 3 town houses in central Amsterdam at the time when Catholics were not allowed to practise their faith in the open. Visiting it, I was surprised as to how much effort and time, not to mention money had gone into constructing it and was also surprised at its size as it holds 150 people. As well as the chapel itself, some of the other rooms in the building have been restored with original features which makes for a quaint, well preserved interesting museum."

They have maintained the look and feel of the attic and all the places of interest are only accessible via (creaky) stairs. You get a good view of the surrounding canal houses from the windows of the house."

It's worth exploring each nook and cranny by climbing every set of stairs that isn't roped off as the signage in the museum is not the clearest.Construction work is continuing on a new visitor centre in the building next door which will be connected via a new underground tunnel. Once complete this will enhance the visitor experience significantly as all the paraphernalia of lockers, giftshops etc. can be moved out of the historic building.It's worth watching the video (in the room at the very top of the museum) about the restoration project running since 2011 and the importance the city council places on this flagship project in reclaiming this area of the city."

This church dates from 1663, and was installed there by merchant,Jan Hartman, at a time that the celebration of Catholic masses in public was forbidden. An audioguide is included in the entrance fee, and museumcard holders can get in for free.In one of the rooms there was a small exhibition on Saint Nicolas, the patron saint of Amsterdam and of the chapel.The museum also has a small museum shopAt the time we visited the museum, some renovations were going on in order to link the house of Jan Hartman with the museum by means of an underground passage."

The main room on the first floor is so typically Dutch. You find yourself in a Vermeer painting. The pastor's bedroom is so quaint. The church on the top three floors is surprisingly spacious and as lopsided as most Amsterdam houses. Downstairs is the old kitchen and even an indoor loo. The clever way the windows as ground level let light even into the basement is an education in itself. The museum has been undergoing renovations for some time. Not sure when it will be finished. If you want to understand something more of the Dutch culture of tolerance, this museum provides a suprising insight into just one aspect. Definitely worth a visit!"

We were given a free Audio Guide and a free locker for our bags.After climbing some very steep stairs we found this unique place which was created so that Catholic people could continue to worship in secret when it was forbidden by the state.We are not very religious and have no affinity to Catholicism but you have to admire the ingenuity and determination which went into creating this church. Not only have they knocked three attics together, but they have also removed floors on two levels to create a secret church.We came to this place with little or no expectations and left in awe.Well worth a visit but unsuitable for anyone with mobility issues owing to the nature of the building"

We did come across this place by accident one afternoon and were so glad we did! The museum/house/chapel was beautiful and very unique. It was also a lot quieter than other museums we had been to that day (Anne Frank), therefore we could walk around at our own pace - and the quietness helped create a sort of tranquil atmosphere. You are also given phone like devices which you scan against certain information points and hold to your ear to hear extra information about different rooms - again this can be done at your own pace and in any order. To us that was a great thing to have, rather than have information points on walls etc. where everyone is trying to crowd around. The history of the place is very interesting, and there are so many different stories to different rooms. It was a lot bigger than we had expected. For us, it ended up being the highlight of our trip and was great value. I would definitely recommend."

But before one gets that far there are some interesting rooms to view. These include the living quarters, bedrooms and one with a fine stove plus chimney. Some rooms have displays of fine clothing. The chapel is spectacular. Its impressive size over two levels meant it could take a sizeable congregation. Its restoration incorporating colours similar to the original is attractive. The old style lighting is very evocative. The altar area is highly decorative with beautiful columns, much statuary and a large painting. On the top level is an organ that looks well used. From the balcony a great perspective of the sheer scale of the church is available.Leaving the chapel on the way back down it was intriguing to see the quarters where the priests lived. This includes a basic kitchen."

The journey to the attic up narrow, steep and now very old stairs left me wondering at the foot traffic it once carried as parishioners regularly made their way to the church to congregate out of the public eye. The free audio-guide naturally enhances the experience, though for those of us ignorant to the workings of organs, I recommend they include some reference to the lever upstairs, of which there is no mention, despite its size and obvious presence."

This church / museum goes by other names and is also listed here in Tripadvisor as Amstelkring Museum or Church of our Lord of the Attic. Admission is EUR8,00 and comes with an audio guide.The typical Dutch exterior belies its unique interior. Of course, the highlight is the well-preserved Catholic church. However a few of the rooms in the main house have been nicely restored to give a unique perspective of the living standards back in the 18th century, as well as the preferences for symmetry in interior design. There are a lot more attractive churches in Amsterdam and Europe and while the church and altar appear rather simple, the audio guide offers a good explanation of the complexities of building this church and its galleries, as well as its relevance in Amsterdam's history. Visitors are free to roam on all floors of the house, even the galleries. At the time of visit, renovations were being done however this did not hinder the experience. Note that this attraction has steep stairs and has no wheelchair access. Overall, Museum Ons' Lieve Heer Op Solder is worth visiting for its historical significance. The admission fee is a little pricey for the amount that can be seen however the costing seems to be comparable with other attractions in Amsterdam. Allot at least 30minutes for visiting. Amsterdam's oldest church, Oude Kerk, is an easy walking distance."

Despite the fact that it had seats for a hundred people, an organ and a resident priest, the church operated in secret until St. Nicholas Church was built and Catholicism was no longer discouraged. We visited early on a Saturday morning and there were very few others - a nice change from the craziness of Amsterdam. The audio tour was very good. Highly recommended for a nice diversion and a look at historical Amsterdam."

The self-guided tour is easy to follow and highlights the history of the church, and the people who established the church and kept it going during a time when catholicism was \"illegal.\" The entry price is very reasonable and it took us just over an hour to complete our visit. The audio guide was also worth renting to get more information. We easily shared one amongst the three of us. You will not find the crowds here as in other Amsterdam museums.

There is lots to see and learn about inside the house and chapel.I rate this far higher than Anne Frank's empty house and the information is conveyed far more professionally here, plus there was not 45-minute queue to get in.

Back in the days when being a practicing Catholic was frowned on but tollerated, this stunning chapel was built in the attic of a 17th century house owned by a rich merchant. The idea was that if nobody knew it was there, nobody could complain. Very 'Dutch' and tolerant. Over the years real Catholic churches were once again built and worship was moved from being secret to being fully open, but this jewel was preserved for posterity. You can use your Museumkaart here too. Highly recommended!"

You might assume you'd be in a smallish space but, in fact, he made quite a large space by opening up several rooms. It's an interesting place to visit, being renovated but with quite a lot in place to look at, but I must admit my overriding question to myself was how he managed to \"smuggle\" what must have been a large number of people into and out of his house each week(?) without getting caught!

This time I discovered it and the visit really made this visit to Amsterdam among my most memorable. The building (and the church) is over 350 years old. Even the staircases are original. The main draw is to see the Catholic Church occupying the top 3 floors of 3 adjacent buildings, and it was used for nearly 250 years until, in the late 1800's a large Catholic Church was built nearby. The church, no longer in routine use for the last 100 years, was one of many \"out of site\" Catholic Churches which were tolerated as long as they could not be \"seen\". The church seated hundreds, and over the years well over a million people climbed the steep stairs to attend. In fact, the wooden stairs have been worn down by 1 cm. Much of the building (really 3) is well preserved from various periods of the last 350+ years. If you have even been to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York City, this is similar in that it shows the way of life of the people (albeit without the stories of the family that lived in the house). The audio guide (free with entrance) is terrific. Just enough information, with great supplemental material. Do check this out, and after go 1 block away from the Canal towards the Hotel Krasnikovsky, and delight in a gelato."

What you get is to see an authentic old house, walk its stairs, see the rooms and furniture and then find yourselves in a church, which is actually larger than some of the churches and chapels we have in my hometowns. Impressive! The audio guide (included in the fee) is very helpful and provides all the info you need. As a result, there are no information displays or stands in the house, which helps keep an authentic atmosphere. A must-see. Free of charge with IAmsterdam Card."

They have nearly completed a very extensive restoration of the chapel. In my mind it was going to be a small room in the attic, but this was a big space taking up the top three floors of the canal house. There are five floors of stairs to navigate up and down and they are steeper than the stairs now being built. However, this is one place i would recommend that you do not miss when visiting the city."

It is not very big and doesn't take long to do maybe an hour. Well worth the very reasonable entry fee. There is a lot of stairs with the moving around so good mobility is important worth remembering before you start. Amazing to see how it would have been hidden away at the top stories of the unique style of the Amsterdam houses. Showing the way the Dutch houses architechture made it more possible to hide it away. We used the headphones and commentary to do the tour with and it explained everything very clearly. Very impressed with it and i like visiting these places and am maybe getting jaded with run of the mill attractions, but this one stands out and you don't have to be religious to appreciate here. Also small tip if you leave any large belongings in a locker as they aren't allowed due to the narrow parts of the tour. Take the camera OUT!"

The Amstelkring Museum or Our Lord in the Attic Chapel affords not only insight into the creative efforts of Catholics to continue their clendestine worship during the Protestant Reformation, but it is also a visit to a typical Dutch house of its day. Hard to believe that this miniature church is tucked away in the upper floor of a private home. We were surprised at the spaciousness and furnishings of the chapel. It would accommodate a surprising number of worshippers. The alter is beautifully carved and the balcony and pew areas are what you might see in a church as well. The house also had a permanent seperate living quarters for the priest. It is currently being renovated but is open during restoration. The house is in a scenic residential area along a canal not far from Centraal Station. It was a private residence and is a good example of the home of an affluent Dutch family of its day, complete with kitchen and other living areas. Not only is it interesting to view the various floors and rooms of the residence, but the windows also afford an opportunity to see the rooftops of other surrounding homes and give visitors a \"birds-eye\" view of the clustered placement of the homes. Something that cannot be seen from the street. As with all old Amsterdam homes, this one encompasses multiple stories and the stairways are very steep, winding, and wedged, so people with disabilities or those who cannot safely navigate such stairways should pass on this attraction. Same story with the Rembrandt House. However, if you can navigate the stairs, both attractions are worthwhile. There is a small gift shop near the entrance."

The key here is that even with the restoration the museum has made an attempt to make this a worthwhile experience for a visitor, with a fairly detailed 12-point written handout describing the house and adjoining rooms. You can even learn a little about the restoration along the way as many of the signs describe what is going on in quite some detail. I guess I just took it as another opportunity to learn about how old houses and paintings are restored although I do see how some people could be a little frustrated by the current layout.It takes about an hour to walk through as is, although I am looking forward to returning in a few years to witness the results of what is obviously a lot of hard work."

For more info go to www.museumamstelkring.nl  From 1578-1795 Catholicism in Amsterdam was illegal, but tolerated. Catholics were forbidden to worship openly so they gathered secretly to say Mass. In 1661 Jan Hartman, a wealthy merchant from the German town of Coesfeld built Our Lady in the Attic. This 150 seat 3 story church was above the home of the man who built the church. There is a back house that was rented to another family. The emergency exit door in the alley was the hidden churches main entrance door. You will see the parlor, canal room, Chaplain's Room, Lady Chapel, lower balcony, upper balcony, Confessional, Jaap Leeuwenberg Room (theses rooms were rented out to other families), the 17th century Kitchen & the 19th Century Kitchen. The hidden church fills the attics of three 17th century merchants' houses. You will be astonished at how beautiful this church is. Put it on your list of \"must see\" attractions in Amsterdam.
