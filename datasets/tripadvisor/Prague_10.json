We were very excited to visit this Cathedral in the Prague Castle district.There are security checks entering Prague Castle which can cause queues/delays and then there is a fee for the various tourist attractions within the Prague Castle district. Tickets can be purchased in the tourist centre directly opposite the Cathedral.As regards getting here; take the metro and the tram as Prague Castle is at the top of a big hill which wouldnt be for all.Really enjoyed the Cathedral which realy dominates the skyline in Prague. It was amazing to wander around not only the interior but also the exterior and admire the architecture.I would say that the Cathedral is a must see when in Prague."

It is so full of beautiful architecture with every smallest detail asking for closer look; of art treasures like sculptures of various styles and ages, stained glass and mosaic. Baroque style monument to St. John Nepomuk is overwhelming though seems a little bit out of place in otherwise rather austere interior. It takes time to have a good walk inside and outside of the building to have a full picture of this magnificent church. When outside, especially pay attention to the former main (royal) entrance (Golden Gate) with golden mosaic and artfully decorated metal gates."

You could easily spend some time here to learn about it's history and culture. Be sure to have small change for the bathroom though. Even with hundreds of people, you're bound to get a really great shot anywhere. The architecture is a must see and they had very interesting stories about how they protected the castle from invaders. It's a good walk though but they have lots of places to stop and rest. At the very back there's a small outdoor caf\u00e9 where the scenic views are gorgeous. I have very fond memories getting lost finding this place, but it was right off one of the stops off the tube, we just made a wrong turn and kept going the wrong way. But it's very close to the Charles Bridge so you could see both in one day."

The ceilings are probably near 100 meters high. The structure is all self supported by a hundred or so arches and flying buttresses. It is an amazing architectural feat and the interior contains many small chapels decorated by period art, statues and carvings."

You need to buy a ticket to get into part of the cathedral, but you can walk through much of it and enjoy the atmosphere and stained glass windows. I would recommend buying the Castle ticket since not only does it include more of the cathedral, but also other activities and sites in the castle. There are some beautiful stained glass windows and although the large rose window doesn't compare to Notre Dame, the cathedral is breathtaking and you will not want to stop taking photos. Try to go early if possible as the crowds can be overwhelming in the whole castle complex."

I walked around the grounds and around the cathedral and took lots of pictures, this cathedral is amazing not just due to the fact that it is huge, but also that the attention to detail in the arcitecture, which is grand and spectacular.If you wanted to go into the cathedral there was a wait of several hours in August. Top time for people to go there is around May thru August I believe, so going there would probably be easier in the September thru April months.Looking at my pictures will show what I mean by a lot of details in the building's look, If you are a cathedral, arcitecture buff you should enjoy this building. .I can not really say much more about this place, so I advise you to see this amazing place/building before the lord strikes you down.....LOL."

I just cannot fathom how people several hundred years ago could have built something this size and this height without cranes. Then look at the construction - many hundred times more detailed than anything that is built these days. Wow. Then go inside and get gobsmacked again. Finishes, ornamentation, statues, glass windows completely over the top. While I marvel at this cathedral and many other cathedrals and churches throughout Europe, I also get really mad at the waste of resources. How much better if these resources were put to use in sorting out poverty and other problems, back then and now. I will shut up now!"

There are two other entrances, one taking you through the park area and the other right off the 22 tram line. Now, the cathedral is a work of art. I recommend an early morning visit as the stain glass windows, which look black from the exterior, are a colorful play of light on the interior. That coupled with the way that light interacts with the interior makes for a beautiful display.After you finish the interior, take a slow walk around the exterior and marvel at how the buttresses are concealed and the quality of the carving of the stone.Could have spent a day just looking at the exterior."

Be warned - the tickets must be bought at the ticket kiosk at the entrance to the Castle complex, which is a bit of a pain if you have got that far before deciding that you want them. Consequently, a lot of people (and tourist groups) only stay around the crowded entrance. The cathedral is well worth the visit."

Our first stop was a fleeting visit to give us an idea of both the cathedral and castle,when we didn't pay, however we decided it was well worth a more detailed exploration, and came back a second day when we paid to see more of the cathedral, castle and surrounds.It is certainly subjective whether you need to pay to see the cathedral itself. You can get perfectly good views from all sides and the first 20 yards or so inside, without paying. However, if you want to see the various tombs, including St Wenceslas, you will need a ticket.If when you purchased a ticket you were doing so just to see the rest of the cathedral, I personally would consider it not worth it, however your ticket gives you access to many other parts of the castle and therefore is certainly worthwhile.Expect to be in and around the cathedral itself for 45mins-1hour, and if you are wanting to see everything in and around the castle itself, probably allow 5 hours."

First, like all important tourist areas in Prague St. Vitus Cathedral is crowded hence it is important to arrive early especially if you want to obtain the audio guide to the Cathedral. I have never seen this done before but you need to leave a rather hefty refundable deposit before they will issue one. This involves the writing of receipts and wasting precious time in line. There is no easy dropping off either as once again you stand in line and wait your turn to get your deposit back. The narrative on the audio is informative but a little too long for each site, it would have been better to have buttons to push for niche interests like it is done in many other churches especially if you buy the package that includes the rest of the Castle Complex. There is a time constraint on the audio so sometimes it is a little hard to plan on how much time to devote to each site. You do however learn a lot.The Cathedral itself is magnificent albeit a little too crowded with many structures inside, personally I prefer clean sweeps and less \"clutter\" even if the \"clutter\" consists of beautiful sculptures, tombs and monuments. The Cathedral was started by the venerated (King and Saint) Wenceslas who is buried here in the holiest of the nearly two dozen side chapels in the Church. Another imposing tomb is that of St Nepomuk 1 1/2 tons of silver was used to construct that one. As in Shakespearian tragedies where family members were prone to murder one another St Wenceslas was killed by his brother while his mother St Ludmilla was strangled on her daughter in law's request. This is why she is most often portrayed with a scarf around her neck. People close to the Royal Family did not fare that well either. St Nepomuk with the splendid silver tomb and the Queen's confessor was thrown off the Charles Bridge into the river Vltava below.From King Wenceslas's chapel you could if it was open to the public which it is not enter the Royal Treasury where the crown jewels are kept. Seven important people have to come together each with a different key to open the door. I have no idea why this is so as many crown jewels including the British ones are much more accessible. There are so many amazing features to this Cathedral from the Golden Gate's sparkling mosaics, the gorgeous stain glass windows to the carvings showing Prague and the Castle in the seventeenth century it would need a far bigger space to do justice to them all.St Vitus Cathedral along with the entire Castle district is not to be missed."

The church was closed on Monday so check if you are going on a Monday. The tour can be quite long but if you have the time you should consider it. If you have the legs consider the bell tower. It is almost 300 narrow steps to reach the top. The steps will take your breath away and so will the view. There are many places to go in Prague to get an overview of the city. This was my favorite not only because of the spectacular view of Prague but also for the view of St. Vitus steeples. There is also an open case view showing how the bell tower clock works. Sit on the bench, catch your breath, and enjoy watching time happen. There are fees involved here including using the restroom. The tower entrance does not take charge cards but the information and ticket center does. This is a must see in my opinion."

So much to see. the architecture is something.Crowds were large later in the day, although the ticket is good for 2 days I never got back after my 3 1/2 hours on day one. Top choice for things to do in my opinion."

The stained glass frescoes are magnificent. We were lucky enough to arrive just as mass was starting so we stayed for the service. After mass we were able to walk around and see the inside without all the tourists as the church was closed to the tour groups during the religious service. The light coming in though the stained glass from all directions was beautiful"

Even when vied from the outside, the grandeur of this majestic cathedral's old facade and its detailed decoration make you feel so small in front of it, while taking you back the old gothic times.From the inside it is one of the most beautiful cathedrals I have yet to see. The brightly coloured stained glass works of Alphonse Mucha contrast really well with the interior. Be sure to stop at the Rose Window (by Frantisek Kysela in 1925-7), which tells the story of creation.While I did prepare myself by reading about the history of the St. Vitus Cathedral, in retrospect, I should have taken a guided tour through the cathedral in order to better understand the many works of art that decorate the cathedral. But still - even without the tour - it was great and well worth the visit.Note that it can get very crowded and the line to get in can be very long. I imagine that it would be best to visit the cathedral as soon as it opens (Hours are Mo - Sa: 9.00 \u2013 17.00; Su: 12.00 - 17.00). I suggest to get the \"Prague Castle \u2013 Circuit A\" tickets, they include other places worth visit within the castle complex and they don't cost too much (full price is about $14).An obvious \"Must-Visit\", this is one of the best things that Prague has to offer."

I first visited Prague in 1969 and came to love the place, however successive visits have made me like it less!Of course since the opening up of Eastern Europe it's inevitable that tourist numbers have steadily increased, but does Czech tourism really have to rip them off so shamefully? St Vitus it the Czech national shrine and a CHURCH ! Is it really necessary to restrict free access to a small area just inside the doors and literally shunt crowds through such a small area? It would not be untoward to charge a small fee to see the Crown Jewels, but not the whole of the rest of the building!Sadly , this is an insidious habit that seems to be increasing in Europe, but I for one will not pay to go into a national place of worship: surely the maintenance of the fabric of such buildings is rightly the duty of the respective states who should be proud to give access to them to foreign visitors."

The Gothic splendour of the choir and chapels, designed by Peter Parler and his sons between 1352 and 1399 was intended to demonstrate Charles IV's power as Holy Roman emperor. It was also intended to be a place of international pilgrimage. But building was halted by wars, lack of money and lack of will and only started again in the 1870s.The chapel housing the body of St Wenscelas is sumptuously decorated in gold, jewelled inlays and colourful wall paintings .In contrast, in the south choir aisle, there is the huge and ostentatious silver Baroque tomb of St John of Nepomuk, installed in 1736. A pair of splendid stained glass windows designed by Czech artist, Alfons Mucha, around 1900, light up the otherwise unremarkable late 19th century nave. Outside,,on the south wall of the cathedral is an elaborate mosaic over the Golden Gate,ceremonial entrance.Dating from 1370, it shows the Last Judgment and is made of Bohemian glass,a unique survival. An exhibition in the cathedral shows how the mosaic was painstakingly restored by the Getty Conservation Institute during the 1990s. A walk round the exterior also gives an opportunity to marvel at the daring and complex sytem of flying buttresses that support the mediecval choir."

This didn't just include the cathedral but 3 more attractions too. The outside was very imposing and gothic. Amazing detailing was used. However when I got inside it was just a bit lacking... although I feel this might have been the fault of my plan! I very much preferred St Nicholas' cathedral which although had a uninteresting exterior when you walked inside it was awe-inspiring and I had visited this first which left St. Vitus Cathedral a lot to live up to! So maybe if you have the option visit this first before St Nicholas' cathedral. There were some beautiful stain glass windows and also the tomb of Good King Wenceslas (a favourite carol of mine so I was very enthusiastic about seeing this).Definitely worth the money. I visited in August on a Saturday so you can only imagine how busy it was and the length of the queues however me and my SO both agreed that it was well worth it.

First of all I visited Rome and if there you have free entrance to St. Peter Basilica (at least when I went) I dont see why they charge entrance here. Never the less it big crows in front of ticket sale, at then also big crowd to enter. Also due the terrorist treath throughout Europe, security is at the entrance. Too much time to spent waiting."

Photos don't capture the true beauty of this place, it really is better in person. Although there is usually a very long queue, it does move fairly quickly and it's certainly worth it. The cathedral is huge and I felt tiny and insignificant stood next to it, the gothic style and the stained glass windows are truly stunning!I would definitely pay another visit the next time I'm in Prague. Please note, that you can get into the cathedral without a ticket although you won't be able to go any further than the first section as there are barriers in place. Only those with tickets can explore the rest of the cathedral. To be able to take photos in and around the cathedral and castle, you need to buy a photo permit which costs 50Czk which I did however no one actually checked to see if I had one while I was taking photos."

Unfortunately, St. Vitus closes at 5pm, which is kind of prime-time for tourists to still be out sightseeing, in my opinion, so I'd like to see it stay open later. On the day we visited, security was conducting bag checks of every person walking into the cathedral, which our guide said is unusual, so we had to queue for maybe 15-20 minutes and beg security to let us inside, as it was almost closing time. The stained glass inside the cathedral is AMAZING -- some of my favorite after having visited 15+ cathedrals across Europe. It's super interesting to me that the cathedral is part of the castle, but was built in various stages and wasn't even completed until the early 1900s.Don't make a special trip just for the cathedral, but if you're going up to the castle, make sure you allot enough time to go into the cathedral before 5pm and take in the amazing stained glass."

Then you walk through the gate and are awestruck with the 2 towers on the front! As you walk around the outside, the gargoyles and flying buttresses are a smaller version of Notre Dame. When you enter, again you are awestruck! It is massive and everywhere you look are spectacular stained glass windows, sculptures, statues and chapels. You must buy the ticket so you can walk through - not just stand at the entrance, which is free. Also buy the audio guide - the signs with explanations are sparse. Definitely worth a visit and we would do it again!"

After touring the church, my wife and I came out church first to WC. Our parents who were 83 year old, were still inside. After WC, we want to go back to the church to get our parents out. But the guards stopped us, saying that the church was being closed. We explained that our parents were inside waiting for us, they refused to let us in. We then asked the guards to help to get our parents out, but they just pretended that they don't understand our English, rejected our request and closed the door. We started calling our parents to get out, the guards shouted at us as if we were playing a plank with them. We were getting angry, they were even more angrier at us. Finally, someone helped to get our parents out. When the guards saw my father was using a walker to get through the door, he did not say anything or help, and were very rude at us."

Actually this cathedral is more impressive from the outside as the inside d\u00e9cor/monuments are rather scarce compared to other major cathedrals in Europe.The line up to enter the cathedral looks intimidatingly long, but moves pretty fast, so don't get discouraged.The overpriced audio guide available for rent offers long commentary of some sights within the cathedral, however many monuments and points of interest are missing audio commentary, which is a pity.We did not buy additional ticket to go up the tower (not included in the admission to the cathedral), so can't comment on that."

I'm still not sure how. I received a barrage of abuse by the elderly member of staff. I told him it was accident and i hadn't done it on purpose. I was shouted at and humiliated in front of everyone. To me this is completely unacceptable particularly in a place of worship. While i was being told that it wasn't an accident with his arms waving i could see and other tourist whose flash was on being told politely by another member of staff. We left as soon as possible.

Taking into account it's sheer size it's certainly dominates the castle district. The cathedral looks awesome from the alter and the stunning stained glass windows to all the little details and frescoes. Built in the gothic style there has been a cathedral on this site for many hundreds of years. A major tourist destination,I enjoy taking tram numbers 22 or 91 up to stop Prazsky Hrad were you can take in St Vitus Cathedral ( Katedrala Sv Vita ) and the castle and streets making up the castle district.A must go destination on any holiday to Prague."

I've seen a lot of the world's most beautiful cathedrals, and I put the St Vitus right up there with them. A truly must see if you're in Prague.One bit of advice, I highly recommend the audio tour. We tried to get the audio tour, but arrived too late in the day. It was a couple of hours before closing, so not sure why, but they wouldn't give us the headsets. I think they said the batteries were too low. We were told to read the signs or come back the next day if we wanted the headset.Another tourist told us that you could read the signs in lieu of the audio tour, so we bought the entry tickets. the few signs we found weren't very informative. And we saw dozens of numbers for the audio tour. We were very disappointed.So, I do recommend seeing the cathedral. If you want to learn about the history, then either do a guided tour or get the headset."

We visited in mid December when the Cathedral was warmly and beautifully decorated with bright yellow flowers. I try not to make comparisons between churches and Cathedrals, because each is beautiful and magnificent in it's own way and for varying reasons, but St Vitus was stunning in it's proportions and history. We would have loved to cover more, but on a tour, time is limited. The stained glass windows and the impressive nave beneath the soaring roof are a magnificent sight to behold . Considering the architect was apparently very young (only in his 20's I believe) this is a stunningly beautiful example of Gothic architecture and reverence. A must see and a definite highlight!"

Words will not do justice to the grandeur of this Cathedral. This is the final resting place of most of the Czech royal family since the time it was built. The classic gothic architecture set it apart for most other places. The stained glass windows just add to the overall beauty.Do NOT miss.."

With a valid ticket, one can get inside deeper into the cathedral and inspect on each altar pieces. If you're a student, make sure to ask for a student discounted ticket as this will lower the admission price by half. The cathedral is epic and breath-taking. The stained glasses are also excellent pieces of art. I must have spent a min. 40 minutes just looking at them. Many English guided tours also comes inside and so it's possible to just stand and listen to their explanation."

This was definitely one of the handful most gorgeous and beautiful churches/cathedrals we have seen and visited in our entire Europe trip thus far standing in the heart of the city. It was huge and impressive and tall and adopted the gothic architectural theme. When we visited the cathedral, it was crowded and visitors would have to follow a queue to get in but it was worthwhile to do so. Upon entering, visitors would gather by groups taking pictures or listening to the introductions by their respective guides.The interior of the cathedral was grand and lovely too, with lots of statues, paintings, religious objects, besides the colourful tinted window panes. It was simply gorgeous! For Catholics, I will think they will like and enjoy this place as they can find \"closeness\" to the saints and God.Photography is allowed inside the church but with no flash and whispering is a must since it is opened to public for prayer as well. And when we were there, we saw a few couples in wedding gowns taking their portfolios with the cathedral as the backdrop!It's no doubt that this was a beautiful church and even if you are not a Catholic or Christian, it is still worthwhile to visit it to have a taste of its culture, history in the Prague!"

We spent a Couple of hours in the Cathedral. Spurge for the audio guide for another $17.00 good for 4 hours ( plus $25 refundable deposit). Very detailed explanation and tons of history if you are so inclined. If you are planning to stay a bit, consider bringing your own water and perhaps a snack.

It is imposing and dominating from the outside, maybe more so due to the proximity of the surroundings, you can't stand far enough away to see it from afar, so it just lowers over you. Inside it is typically medieval gothic Christian ostentation and posture, beautiful and overpowering at the same time. Strangely enough on of the windows isn't medieval gothic, but Art Nouveau, designed by the wonderful Alfons Mucha. The doors which combine the Green Man and other pagan sybols with images of Christian Saints is a great historical detail. There is so much to see and marvel at, that you can't take it all in in one visit."

Gorgeous architecture and stained glass windows."

For me, it was one of the most lovely I've seen, compared to others that are more austere or baroque ones with frills everywhere. It's somewhere in the middle of those extremes. We went early in the morning, and it was pretty crowded with a bit of a wait to get in. I noticed that later in the day it was actually less crowded, which surprised me. (Maybe that's not true every day, but it was on the day we were there.)"

The crowds are unbelievable, and the trams are often packed with people. The church is on the grounds of Prague castle, easily accessed by the Green Tram line to \"Malostranska\", then a #22 tram to \"Prazsky hrad\". I strongly recommend the Rick Steves travel book, \"Prague\", as a guide to the city. The Royal Botanic gardens, to the left after you get off the tram, are nice but nothing impressive."

It is the Czech Republic\u2019s largest and most important cathedral\u2014and possibly in Central Europe. It actually is a collection of several houses of worship, including St. Vitus, St. Wenceslas Chapel, and Gothic Cathedral. Construction on the first building began in 960AD, and continued for centuries. Many significant religious and political figures are entombed here, such as King Charles IV.So much for construction history. In a word, this cathedral is astounding. The architecture is sheer art. Marble and gold overwhelm visual senses, and the feeling of spirituality permeates. The scope of the dimensions is unfathomable, but research reveals the height of the main tower is 97 meters\u2014about 315 feet, comparable to a 30-story building. Plan for several hours to absorb all this complex collection of Gothic buildings has to offer."

Don't stand in long queue - buy them in Star\u00fd kr\u00e1lovsk\u00fd pal\u00e1c - queues are much shorter. Inside Cathedral you'll be enchented buy size of the thing. It's both gothic and noegothic, with lot of sculptures, triptics, chappels, graves etc. Main stained glass rosette on the front wall is particulary impressive. Decorated grave of St. Nepomucen is beautiful and rich in details. Amazing monument. Watch for waves of organized trips - it's better to wait around any chappels until they went away."

Although looking very ancient from the outside, it was started in the mid-14th century but not completed until 1929! Despite this, the exterior is a perfect example of High Gothic. although not the tower with a baroque dome. Inside the highlight for me was a beautiful stained glass window designed by Mucha in 1920, and its a shame one can only view the beautifully decorated chapel of St Wenceslaus through the doorway. Outside the South gable has a wonderful mosaic of the Last Judgement. As access to the area of the Cathedral by the doors is open to all, it gets very crowded, so do make sure you have a ticket so you can wonder around the building in peace."

When looking up at the spires and the rose window of this church one should know that they were designed in 1890's and built in the 20th century using 20th century methods and materials. The same goes for the main nave which was began in early 20th century and finished in 1929. Only the back of this church is actually old. Most of it is about as old as the Disneyland castle. Its pretty, but much of it is a fake trying to imitate a true gothic building. If I want to see a fake gothic cathedral I can go to Washington DC (which is about as old) and see it, no need to fly over the Atlantic."

You can enter the main portion free of charge, but you must be ticketed to see the outer chapels and most of the building. I STRONGLY recommend buying the ticket that includes admission to the whole cathedral. We brought along a guide book with information on the names and some details about each chapel, which was VERY helpful, as there is minimal or no signage with information anywhere. If I did it again, I would rent an audioguide or take an actual tour so I could learn more. Still, even with some minimal guidebook info we probably spent an hour just marveling at the beauty of the space. It was crowded, but if you take your time and space yourself between tour groups, there is plenty of room to see and take in all the sights."

The first church at this place has been built (just as a rotunda) at the beginning of the 10th Century by prince Wenceslas. When Wenceslas died his remains were stored here. In the end of 11th century the building has been changes by bigger and more representative Basilica. The foundation stone of the Cathedral was laid by Jan Lucembursky in 1344, the western part of the building with two 80m high towers were added in the years 1873-1929. When you come here you'll surely feel the rich historic age, deep spirituality, and you can see also approx. 20 chapels. There are 7 bells in the Cathedral, the biggest one = Bell Zikmund from 1549 (also the biggest bell in Czech Republic) weighs 13,5 tons and its diameter is 2,6 meters... Also you'll see the beautiful Stained Glasses, portraits, paintings and you'll receive many useful information - e.g. names of kings and emperors buried here in the Cathedral, etc.When you are in Prague you must to see the Prague Castle; when you are in Prague Castle, you must see the St.Vitus Cathedral.

I arrived at the castle by way of Line A: Malostranska, tram 22 and got off at the Prazsky Hrad stop, right outside the castle entrance. I arrived just before opening time so I could get some good photos minus the tourists. There are two types of tickets available, both of which include entrance to St. Vitus. I purchased the more expensive ticket as I wanted to see as much of the castle area and other buildings as possible. I walked around the area for several hours looking at other buildings due to St. Vitus not opening until around noon that day. When I walked back to the cathedral about a half hour before it was due to open, I discovered a long line of people waiting to get in. If you just want to walk around the castle grounds without a ticket, you can only stand in the vestibule of the cathedral. If you purchase a ticket, you must show it at the entry in the left aisle and then continue at your own pace all around the cathedral. I went around twice. Be sure to note the third window on the left as you start your walk. It is a beautiful stained glass window designed by Alfons Mucha in 1931. There are chapels and tombs, some dating from the 1500s, all around. At the high altar are graves of bishops, including the tomb of St. Vitus. There was a large crowd at the front of the cathedral the day I was there making it difficult to move around due to a large display that everyone wanted to photograph. Once through the crowd, it was easy to see the rest. Continuing down the aisle, the right transept, is the chapel of St. Wenceslas with its precious and semiprecious stone encrusted walls. The chapel is roped off but you can see inside from here, or walk around the corner for another view which might be better. I like to take many photographs so spent most of the day exploring the castle grounds and other buildings."

Definatley worth sticking your head in the door to get a general feel for the inside and the stained glass windows are amazing. We didn't go around all the little nooks and crannies and separate chapels though I am sure they were interesting. You are able to just go inside the doors into the first part of the Knave which gives you a good feel for the place, its architecture, design and grandeur and you can see most if not all of the stained glass from there. It looks like you need to buy a ticket if you want to walk around the rest of the cathedral, assuming you do not object to paying to see the inside of a religious structure."

It's a shame that the general population of the world has forgotten this in its quest to pout at a mobile phone."

We spent several hours here and many photos were taken although in certain parts you had to obtain permission to take photos and I think, payment for a license.

The hike up from Charles bridge is pretty significant, but well worth it to experience the sights along the journey. Absolutely amazing.

Most people there seemed to be in tour groups - I don't know why as it's a very tourist-friendly city - and they were all so desperate not to lose their guide that it became quite a scrum. At one point everyone going round the one way system had to go through a pinch point one person wide, resulting in total traffic jams. A lovely cathedral, but for a quiet experience you'd better go to a service when the tourist groups are banned."

The towering gothic arches inside the church are enhanced by some of the most beautiful stained glass windows I've ever seen. One was even done by the Art Nouveau master Alphonse Mucha! This is included in the entrance fee to the Castle. The cathedral is also very interesting when viewed from the exterior where you can see the different stages and styles of construction that took place over hundreds of years. Wander around the rest of the castle grounds but be sure to see this wonderful cathedral."

Everything that's a part of Prague Castle is beautiful & breathtaking. Would suggest taking a taxi or trolley up there (as it is on top of a hill). Be prepared for description signs not to be in English (something I wish the Czech tourist industry would address- only because English is a universal language & not everyone visiting can master the Czech language in a short period of time). Highly recommend going with a tour company the 1st time (to obtain the history) & later returning to stroll the gardens & seeing other missed artifacts. If it's a rainy & cold day- do not go!!! Wait for a sunny & warm day to enjoy the site. We had to learn the hard way."

Purchase a guide booklet or rent an audio-guide at the ticket office first unless you are fluent in Latin (few signs are translated into English or other languages). The statuary, multiple marble side altars, loft with magnificent organ pipes, and stained glass windows ascending the walls to the ever-rising ceilings immerse you in this gothic masterpiece of both architecture and worship. Though still beautiful on a rainy day, I would love to see sunshine cascading through the stained glass to the church within - the dark wood, and architectural features result in very low available light for non-flash photography.

It is worth the wait, but BEFORE you join this queue, I strongly suggest you go across the courtyard to an entrance marked 'tickets' and buy a ticket. If you don't, you will still be able to get into the Cathedral, but you only get about a quarter of the way in before you reach a ticket barrier. This is enough to enjoy most of the spectacular stained glass, but there are two lovely windows partly obscured by the pillars, and the East End is very distant."

The chapel of St. Wenceslas is remarkable, and is the home of the Czech crown jewels, which are displayed every 5 years.The Cathedral loses a star as you need to buy a photo permit (50 Crowns) if you want to take pictures.

The Czech tour guide was very knowledgeable and well beyond the confines of tour itself. We discussed history details, government bodies, historical economics and he was as sharp as he was interesting. Very pleased.People should spend a few hours in the area. Much to see."

The architecture and the stone was very beautiful and the ceilings were very tall. One of my favourite cathedrals I have see for sure. However you can see (I think) enough of it without paying to go in and see it.You can buy a ticket to see back 3/4 of it. The cheapest ticket (bought from the information centres around the Prague Castle) was 250 CZK or ~10 USD. This got you into the cathedral, St. George's Basilica the golden lane and some old part of the castle (not sure didn't go there). I think if you see all the four things on the ticket, it is probably worth it. I didn't want to see the other things so it was pricey for me but c'est la vie. I would say the cost of the ticket was not worth walking further into the cathedral. Without the ticket you can still enter the cathedral and see most of the windows that were impressive. The rest of the cathedral didn't really do it for me in terms of a ~$10 experience if that is all you see. If you want to see St. Georges Basilica and the other two places on the ticket, it may be more worth it for you. All and all it was a very beautiful cathedral that reminded me a lot of the Glasgow Cathedral with the architecture and colour of the stone."

The cathedral is an excellent example of Gothic architecture and contains the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors. The Cathedral, consisting of the central nave, has narrow aisles with small chapels illuminated by the light going through colored windows showing many sacred motifs also depicting classic Art Noveau imagery.

However, once the renovations are done and the areas are opened up again it would be worth it. You can get entry as part of a combined ticket to various castle attractions."

The popularity of this key site came as no shock, but I was easily compensated for the 30 minute wait once inside. Elegant and striking are just a couple of adjectives I'd use to describe it.If I had time to kill and wanted to show someone around Prague, this would certainly be one of the places I'd take them.To some surprise most of what you see of St. Vitus Cathedral was in fact constructed as early as the last century in spite of its somewhat older looking facade."

However, this one had to be a part of the itenary as I had read a lot about it. Am glad I explored it. It is beautiful.!!The stained glasses with beautiful carvings add to the charm of the church. As Indians, we are not used to clicking pictures in Churches and temples and other religious places (its not allowed). So we captured this church in as many photos as we could :)"

As Castles go Prague Castle and St Vitus' Cathedral are not the most breath taking places to visit but they are up there, and a must if visiting Prague. The outside is free to walk around and has some interesting souvenir stalls/ food kiosks in the yard beside the Cathedral. We paid to go into the Toy Museum which was cheap and a bit of fun. We also visited a midday concert in Loebowitz Palace inside the Castle grounds which was an hour long and excellent. The highlight though was a guided tour by a Lloyd Grossman sounding lovely Czech guy who filled in all the blanks on the Castle, the Cathedral and general Czech/Prague history. If you visit the Castle and pay to go into the Cathdral etc DO the guided tour as it brings the place to life."

If you like church, you will enjoy the detailed design inside and take plenty of pictures from the outside as well.On certain days (not sure if it's everyday) - there's like a little bazaar outside that sells accessories and food. You will see plenty of local choices there, just try a little bit of everything and have a nice beer :)You can access it through entering the Prague Castle (on the way up from Mala Strana), which is a complex containing multiple huge sections and buildings.Cheers"

Sadly its so over crowded with guided tours you can barely get a chance to see anything, they stop dead infront of you and dont really care, the guides will do anything they can to push you out of the way to get their group in.Beautiful place but be prepared to be squished and irritated. Really ruined the experience for me."

Also the tumb of St. John Nepomucenus is wonderfull. One of the stained glass was designed by Mucha. Do not miss the catacombs - you can see the remains of older churches and also the tumbs. On the southern side there is also beautifull Golden Gate mosaic. Also woth it is the visit of the tower - from there you can see the whole Prague."

Sometimes when I visited these churches in Europe, I just cannot refrain from wondering how on earth could the architects in bygone years came up with such complicated structures and artistic decors with infinite details and how skilful were the artisans and artists who completed their task without the myriads of machineries and gadgets available to our contemporary builders. The even more amazing thing is I believe these mammoth structures would have been built over many many years and so there must be a succession of architects, artisans and artists who had to keep the consistency and quality through and through. It is thus really worth the time to appreciate these great works of our predecessors instead of just filing through and registering nothing other than a couple of photos and keeping with the \"I have been there\" mentality. My salute to those who have made it possible for us to appreciate lost skills, stamina and imaginations and those who have kept the place intact over the years. A must visit when you come to Prague."

St John of Nepomuk has a beautiful shrine here, as does St Wenceslas. We took a guided tour, which was wonderful and interesting, and you'll learn quite a bit about the fascinating history of this beautiful place. Take the time to let the spirit and history envelop you and you will feel blessed by the experience. If you come to Prague you must visit. Combine it with a walk through Petrin Hill and park, overlooking the city and Vltava River. This is an experience you will never forget!"

Visited this cathedral on our walking tour (discover prague walking tours) and was so blow away by the interior light, detailed stain glass windoes and peacefulness of the space despite being with 400 people I did not know. Entry to cathedral is free to view but you will need a paid ticket to walk around. Last entry is at 3:40 so take you photos after you visit the church."

This cathedral was what I really wanted to see out of all the sites in Prague.It was closed for some of the day but we managed to get in for a look around later.You can come up & see the cathedral from the outside for free but will have to buy a ticket to enter. It really is so beautiful inside. There are lots of stained glass windows too.Practical info-Its uphill to get to the castle so it's recommended to wrap up warm, wear comfy shoes& get a tram. Get tram no. 22 from Narodni divadlo (in the direction of bila hora). This is a little further on from Charles bridge. The Castle stop is Pohorelec.Once you get off you wander down to the castle & can watch the changing of the guard each hour. The all inc ticket is 350 krowns for circuit A,or you can do circuit B for 250 which covers most of it. I mostly wanted to see the cathedral,the royal palace is underwhelming & the golden lane not very exciting either. Not sure how much it is to get into cathedral alone but that's probably the highlight of the castle. It closes by 4pm so get here earlier in the day & there's a toilet charge of 10krowns each.The cathedral gets a 5 star rating the rest is around 3.5!"

Most people believe that it is the Prague Castle because this is the most visible part of the Prague Castle complex. This Gothic masterpiece was commissioned by King Charles IV in 1344. It was completed in 1929 in 6 centuries. It has several beautifully adorned chapels like the Wenceslas Chapel which is adorned with real gems. It was an important part of the Czech Monarchs lives as this was where they were coroneted and buried. Thus the crypt and the royal mausoleum holds the remains of most of the Czech kings and queens and their patron saints. The most interesting thing is that King Charles is buried here with all four of bis wives. The Royal route of Prague started from the Powder Tower and ended at St.Vitus Cathedral. All coronation and funeral processions went up this route. The Coronation Jewels are also stored here in the Crown Chamber. The first part of the Cathedral is free for everyone but you have to purchase a ticket to see all the sections. Interesting legends go about this cathedral. One of these says that when the great Charles IV died, all the bells at the tower started to ring by themselves followed by all the bells of Prague.Tip: The Great South Tower, which hold the largest Czech bell called Zikmund, offers a stunning view of the city. You have to climb 287 steep steps to reach the top though."

You can really tell that they are relatively modern creations: the colours are so much more vibrant than any ancient window I've seen can achieve. The Cathedral itself is fairly standard Gothic revival. You have to pay to go further in, but it's free to access the westernmost part, which is more than enough to take in the main attraction, i.e. the windows."

We visited the temple of St. Vitus in December 2015 and we had to wait in line for at least 45 minutes before we manage to enter. We had already bought a ticket for St. Vitus and after we entered we started the tour to the several chapels. It was impressive but definitely not something that we had not seen before in other gothic churches. There were too many visitors inside St. Vitus and in some narrow passages it was so crowded that we had to stop walking for some minutes. Suddenly, while I was looking at the vitro glasses, one man of the security grabbed my jacket (so violently that I almost lost my balance!) and ordered me to remove my hood! I tried to explain to him that I was freezing cold but he insisted that I MUST remove my hood!!! Despite the expensive ticket, the administration of St. Vitus apparently considers it unnecessary to turn on the heating with temperatures below zero in December! The guard could not understand me and he started yelling at me in front of the other people! I had never experienced such a humiliation in my life! Ironically, though, the impolite man working in St. Vitus was also wearing a hood but that was obviously OK...Only my hood was bothering him... I immediately regretted paying a ticket in order to be treated like that! Needless to say that the lady at the cashier of the Castle was also impolite and completely ignorant of words like \"Thank you\" and \"Please\". Since I am used to having manners and being surrounded by polite people, it was quite a shock for me to experience such a lack of manners at one of the most popular attractions of Prague. Apparently I do not recommend it!"

From the intricate carvings surrounding the doorways on the exterior to the smallest details on the paintings and the stained glass are unbelievable. No words I put here can truly explain how magnificent this place is. It is something that everybody should see for themselves."

St Vitus Cathedral is an excellent example of Gothic architecture and per the materials I read is the largest and most important church in the Czech Republic. The Cathedral is part of the Prague Castle complex and is home to the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors. While I enjoyed the interior, I spent hours photographing and looking up at the gargoyles all around the building and took many photos of the brass work on the doors of the Golden Portal. All in I found it to be a beautiful experience and stopped several times on this visit and have made it a point to visit on every trip to Prague."

There are various price options while you are there; with many other attractions/buildings on the same site, you can pay to see them all, or individual ones. We had a peek inside the cathedral but you had to pay to go all the way in. Instead we decided on paying to go up the south tower, to the very top of the cathedral. Having been in many cathedrals before, I'm a sucker more for the view from the top than I am from the inside, although the stained glass windows and architecture inside and out was absolutely stunning. The climb up the tower is around 270/280 steps, and it takes some leg stamina to get up there! Not recommended for the less able-bodied or elderly, or those who may get dizzy easy (spiral staircase all the way up). From the top you realise it was well worth the walk! 360 degree views from the top cover the whole Prague city and more besides. Fortunately the day we went was dry and clear, albeit it a little cloudy. We got some fab photos from the top and it was a great alternative to seeing Prague from above, compared to say Petrin Tower, which we didn't get chance to go to. I think we paid around 160 Koruna each to get admitted, which is just over \u00a35. Well worth it if you get to go to the castle area.NOTE - use the ticket office in the main square opposite the entrance to St Vitus. There are smaller offices in other buildings but we found they were closed or manned by non-English speaking staff who we struggled to communicate with."

They open up the doors so you can go inside and Watch 9 am - 16 pm I Think. Check it out Before you go because we regret not being able to see the inside.

You can see the front section of the Cathedral at no cost, but the ticket gives you access to all the naves and art lining the walls. Definitely worth the price of the ticket. This is a beautiful cathedral, and my companion, who has seen many more cathedrals than I have, insists it is one of the most beautiful she has seen. The outside is lined with gargoyles, and there is a separate gargoyle tour, which we did not go on. You really can't avoid St. Vitus if you go to Castle Hill, but I certainly recommend seeing the full thing."

If you only have a few hours in Prague--or if you have the opportunity to spend a few days in this intriguing city, you must visit the Castle and St.Vitus' Cathedral. It's at the core of the Czech national spirit and identity.Some of the grounds are free, but I'd suggest the 250 Kc ticket to enter the main areas of the splendid cathedral and other significant sites in the grounds. We visited in mid-winter and the Gothic splendour of the structures was only magnified by the snow and bareness of the gardens. I'd strongly suggest a guided tour-preferably by a Czech national--and the guides from City Sightseeing are excellent. It's a stiff walk from the river but trams and buses run right to the entrance. Probably not the best attraction for families with young children."

Inside, lights were on and the stained glass panels came to life, including the Mucha panel.Later in our trip, we came back in daylight and toured the inside. This is a must see - it was amazing. When you go to Europe, you see a lot of churches. This will be a Top 5 experience. We also walked up the tower - warning, this is a lot of steps - and the view of the church, Castle Hill, and the city of Prague was just awesome. So many colors, tile roofs, cobblestone streets, and church spires in the distance. Unreal, and this is a unique view you can only get being up on the hill, and then up the steps to the top of St. Vitus."

If you ar walking this is an easy way to climb the hill. It is hard to describe the gradure of St. Vitus. LIke other cathedrals in Europe it was built over centuries. Each section has a unique character. The stain glass windows alone are worth the climb. The main altar as well as side altars are stunning. We had the good fortune to arrive just as a Sunday service was about to begin. We had the wonderful experience of attending the service, hearing the organ and choir which is not usually part of any tour. The different styles over the centuries bend to make this a very interesting space."

Unfortunately, although the foyer of the church was so crowded with tour groups we weren't really able to explore any history, the view from inside is awe-inspiring. I did buy a ticket to climb the tower (warning -- 287 steps up a stone spiral staircase, not for the faint-hearted) and was rewarded with stunning views of the city. Sadly, the sun we had the day before was not here this day, so the photos were not quite so crisp, but compared to the town square tower the crowds were virtually non-existent, so taking my time was not a problem. Definitely a must-see."

The building from the outside, is really informative about st. Vitus life (for example, his life is showed on the main door) and from the inside you can learn a lot more, not only about st. Vitus but about the city and the whole coutry as well. Also, when you are inside pay attention to the beautiful stained glass windows. You can buy tickets to the st.Vitus separately, but there are also tickets where you can combine visiting the old palace, the st.George basilica, the st. Vitus cathedral and the golden lane. I think 125 czk for students (reduced). (of course there is an even bigger combination where you can visit pretty much everything in the district). Generally the st. Vitus cathedral is a must if you visit Prague!"

Be warned, the tower contains 287 steps with no breaks at any point. My partner and I are quite fit individuals and even we had to catch our breathe at the top but it is definitely worth it if you think you're up for it.

We returned a few days later, again, in the morning (because that's what worked for our schedule). It was crowded outside; we stood in line to enter the cathedral for about 5 minutes. It was crowded inside; we stood in line to get passed the free viewing area. Many tour guides take their groups through the cathedral en masse so it gets congested in areas. There was one area under restoration that added to the congestion. We followed the Rick Steves self-guided tour, which hit the highlights of the beautiful interior.

I asked a guide/docent where the Wenceslas Tomb was, I pointed to the word (in Czech) on the map and my response was only a shrug and a \u201cgrumph\u201d sound, not even a smile. There are signs EVERYWHERE that say \u201cno photos without license\u201d, but scads of tour groups were taking photos with hand held cameras, tripods and cell phones.

It is a very rich cathedral and you should look in your guide book for all the details (I bought the Rick Steves guide book). There are spectacular stained glass windows, various sculptures and statues, a fantastic altar, and many other things. It is very crowded. You can buy Ticket B at 250 Czech crown for the entrance.

Not only do you see all of Prague spread below you but you get a closer look at all of the gothic architecture of St. Vitus. The gothic spires and flying buttresses are magnificent when seen from above. There are 297 steps to get up to the top but as long as you are in moderately good shape it isn't too difficult. Visit early in the day to avoid lines or, even better, visit off season. I went in late September/early October and had good weather with no crowds."

Make sure you tour both inside and the exterior of the church, including the mosaics outside."

It is an awe-inspiring construction and a perfect example of a gothic cathedral not to be missed for its flying buttresses, soaring windows, rose window and the silver tomb of St John of Nepomuk. An experience without the audio guide, but if gothic cathedrals excite you and you have the time, I would say get the audio guide or even smartphone app to maximise your experience. The cheapest ticket that includes the cathedral is 250 czk which is a bargain at less than \u00a37. However, it seemed to be possible to enter the back of the cathedral and look down the nave without a ticket. If you would like to walk the length of the cathedral, look back at the rose window and see the silver tomb, you will need a ticket to go through the turn-style."

It is kind of sad that you cannot buy separate ticket to the church (at least I did not see such option), but have to buy it as part of wider and thus more expensive tour, because it might hold some people back from entering it and they will never know what they missed out on. I love medieval churches as architectural category, so I went in already positively biased towards what I was going to see, but already the first stained glass window smashed me with its bright and vivid colors and wonderful composition so much that I actually almost forgot to look at anything else than windows. The chapel of St. Wenceslas also is a gem in its own right, even you cannot go inside it (at least not as usual tourist) you still get the feeling of its grandness. Unfortunately, royal cripts were closed due to technical reasons. But even that could not take away the general awe I was into about this church."

This cathedral is Gothic in architecture and is the seat of the archbishop of Prague.The Cathedral contains the tombs of many Bohemian Kings and Holy Roman Emperors and resembles a palace.St Wenceslas Chapel situated at the right hand corner mid-way to the church altar is the most important place in the entire cathedral where the mortal remains of the Saint are kept in a room.Entry to the inside of the chapel is closed for visitors who can only view the doorway leading to the chapel. A door at the South Western corner of this chapel having 7 locks leads to the \"Czech Crown Jewels\" kept in the crown vault.

St Vitus is included in the short tour - 250 crown (there is a long tour - 350 crown)Wow! doesn't cover it. The entrance is stunning, the stone work is amazing. The stained glass will blow you away and the interior art work is just breath taking. We spent a long time in here as there is so much to look at between plaques, statues, confession booths, pulpits, altars, columns....I could go on. It was busy with tourists and organised guides. They get in the way and their constant babble takes over sometimes, but it is worth a visit for the architecture alone. The cathedral is set in the grounds of Prague castle. It dominates the skyline and if you get a chance to see it go. If I had been able to attend a service, or concert their I would have. The organ was immense. Only snag....their is an upper gallery, but it's out of bounds.........but then I'm just nosey!"

It could be better with an earlier opening, say at 7 or 8 AM. But 9 AM it is, and long before then people are lined up waiting, so it isn't easy to get in ahead of the crowd. That said, a chance to see Alphonse Mucha's magnificent St. Wenceslas window shouldn't be passed up. In other words, when push comes to shove -- literally! -- it's worth a visit if only to see the justly-famous stained glass. And there are other rewarding sights, assuming you can get to them. The 14th century mosaic of the Last Judgment, recently conserved by the Getty Foundation, would probably be foremost among them. But such things to my mind are best seen in the more tranquil, more devotional atmosphere that you'd think would characterize a house of worship. While worth engaging in hand-to-hand (or camera-to-camera) tourist conflict to get a good view of precious works of art like these, the experience at St. Vitus Cathdral left a lot to be desired.I don't have an answer to the problem of \"too much of a good thing.\" All I can say is that visiting any time during Prague's extended tourist season has challenges that you will need to overcome if you are to enjoy your visit and accomplish your purposes in visiting."

While it is part of the Prague castle complex, its structure dominates the skyline of Prague. Charles IV began the construction of the cathedral in 1344. St. Vitus is the spiritual symbol of the Czech state but only about 2% of Czechs practice their religion. Inside the cathedral are the tomb of St. Wenceslas and the Crown Jewels. The Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop. The cathedral\u2019s main tower has a double lantern dome and bears the coat of arms of the Bohemian Kingdom. The clock tower, the tallest of the cathedral's towers, reaches a height of 317 feet.

There are some wonderful stained glass windows but do not overlook the Mucha window and if you have not already done so then do visit the Mucha gallery which is very close to Wenceslas square.We joined a tour to visit and arrived here by coach but you can catch a 22 tram which takes you close. The tour combines with a visit to the castle and Golden lane which has shops and small museum shops."

The church, for this interested in architecture, raises an interesting point \u2014 namely, is it gothic REVIVAL or just Gothic SURVIVAL, since the architects very carefully reproduced the original details on the 14C part of the building. St. Vitus is a very busy tourist site, and the authorities have handled it in a very weird way: one can enter the cathedral, see the altar, and some of the 19C stained glass but one cannot fully enter the building without paying, but the tickets is obtained outside the cathedral in the nearby tourist office and costs around $10. I was with a tour, and by the time I figured this out, I no longer had time to see the cathedral. The best sight of St. Vitus and the surrounding castle, however, is free and at night. The art museums in Prague, particularly the one for 19-20C art and design is worth more of one's time."

When my family walked in we were all over whelmed with the beauty of this magnificent Cathedral, the service was beautiful, and we were glad to have had the exp. The sad part was that there were only 20 people there for the service, I am not kidding, a place that could hold 1,000 Prague cathedral evening service, a beauty to behold and it was empty of actual practicing Catholics, as many as such in Europe churches are becoming places of tourist visits... nothing more"

Free entrance with the Prague card - it makes it more convenient to see a lot of sights and take trams, but it may not save a significant amount of money at the end of the day.

By doing this we were not able to go inside the cathedral but it was worth it since the lighting at night was spectacular. I would definitely recommend visiting the cathedral at night. There were maybe a handful of people up there at night and it seems that many of them were locals just taking a stroll. The grounds are open until midnight so you can just soak up the history on your own."

Wrap up well if walking around or taking in a concert, it can be very cold in the off season and the Chapel is not heated, but the music superb, even the 1st violin arrived in leathers and a cap which he only took off to play, ok so he did wear a tux underneath lol!

The most striking feature of this church which you probably won't see in many others is the advertisement of the firms that sponsored some of the internal construction and decoration when the state ran out of money. The church belongs to the state (rare situation) and has a free section and then a paid section (the state and the church went to war over possession and that led to empty coffers).

Once we showed our ticket and continued in, there were very few people and no tour groups. It was great! We stayed until closing, and just before, the organ started playing! Really beautiful."

The price of ticket is not even just for how much effort must these people put to maintain it to it's original state. My advice is to buy one of the tours for the castle. You won't regret it. As a bonus, spectacular views over old town. I went in April and it was crowded. Can't imagine how long is the queue during the summer season."

Whilst I havent seen all the attractions of the Prague Palace ( for instance I never saw the Treasury) this was the standout and only part worth seeing from my point of view.What was great about itThe Church itself which is massive and well lightedThe many types of stained glass windows including one designed by Mucha..The special area for King Wenceslas..you cant go in it but good views availableTombs of many Czeck kings buried hereThe many special altarsDefinitely the best church we saw in Prague although the Tyn Church just off the main town square is nice as well"

It never ceases to amaze me, as a non religious person, how much these old cathedrals, churches, and basilicas amaze me. The art history held within each of these I have been able to visit is enough for a lifetime of study. I do not believe I will ever tire of making these visits. And St Vitus's is a wonderful example. Even before you walk inside you have to stand back and take in the Gothic Architecture from the 14th century. Then once you go inside you are forced to appreciate the sheer size. But there is still art in abundance. Especially in the St Wenceslas Chapel where the walls are adorned with \"over 1300 semi-precious stones and paintings about the Passion of Christ dating from the original decoration of the chapel in 1372\u20131373 \". There is much more to take in and I could go on and on, but you truly have to see it for yourself."

Unless you're in great shape, trying to walk up to it could lead to a heart attack. Once up there, the views, buildings, and sites are really spectacular. (Bring head gear and appropriate attire for the weather, because it can get REALLY WINDY up there). The cathedral itself is very impressive. Be prepared for long lines to enter, especially in the first opening hour. Tickets are required if you want to walk thru the entire Cathedral. It's well worth it. Make sure you walk around the entire exterior of the cathedral grounds because the views of Prague below are breathtaking from every vantage point. Also - GO to the small cafe just outside the cathedral because their food is simply wonderful. I ordered a curried chicken that was the absolute best and most memorable meal I had on our entire trip thru Salzburg, Prague, and Vienna. And they even have soy milk options for all their hot drinks. I ordered a peppermint schnapps hot chocolate with soy milk that was simply heavenly. Overall, a great experience."

When you come through the tunnel from the castel, do NOT stop right at the exit to take pictures. You will block hundreds of other visitors. If you really need to take a photo from that angle, move to the side! Btw from the side are better photo spots (see my photo)...2. Only the entrance area is free3. If you like to see more than the entrance, you need to buy a ticket. This is a site that is free with the Prague card. If you visit many other attractions, you should consider buying this card.4. Climb the 287 steps up the tower. This ticket requires you to be somewhat physically fit. Together with the TV tower (not so easy to get to) and Petrin tower (tram currently closed), the cathedral tower has the best view in Prague. Highly recommended !"

Have also a look at the St Wenceslas Chapel and at the mosaic of The Last Judgement (14th cent) at the outside.If you find the courage to climb the tower besides the cathedral you will give yourself a treat.

Just inside the entrance when you go under the arch under the big stained glass window there is a groove that runs from one side of the arch to the other. If there are 2 of you try talking into the groove and amazingly the sound will travel to the other side - a marvel of acoustics.

St Vitus Cathedral,a Gothic masterpiece standing with in the confines of Prague castle; is the largest & most important religious place for the Czech Christians & the city`s top tourist attraction .It also serves as the internment of the remains of the sovereigns,noblemen,archbishops & patron saints.I entered the Cathedral through the portal in the western facade between the 2nd & 3rd courtyards of the castle.The bronze door is decorated with reliefs from the history of the cathedral & the legends of St Wenseslas & St Adalbert.The chapel of St Wenceslas is the cult center of this cathedral & most important patron saint.The walls have precious stones & stained glass windows with magnificent decorations & wall paintings of the `Passion Cycle`in the Golden portal.The south-western corner of the chapel leads to the crown chamber with its Royal jewels.The nearby `Great south tower` holds the biggest bell dating to the 16th century.You can climb the over 90 meters height with about 300 steps to have a superb view of the castle & the city.For an entry to the first part of the cathedral you don`t require to purchase a ticket but you have to have one for the whole cathedral viewing."

I visited the cathedral at 9:00am in July and did not find it overly crowded. There were a few tour groups, which can be frustrating to be caught between. Most of the time, I had no trouble hearing my audioguide and had lots of space to myself. You do need to buy the photo permit to photograph the interior, but no one checked my permit at any point. I walked by St. Vitus Cathedral at around 12:00 and there was a huge line to get in. You should definitely visit early."

The queue to go in can be pretty long but always moving. As you enter the cathedral, as a non paying costumer, you are only able to enter the entrance which will lead into the main building. You are able to see the whole nave as well as the alter from afar and take as many photos as you can. If you have a good zoom on your camera, you won't be missing anything really. Now, I'm not saying that you shouldn't pay, but in comparison to other Cathedrals around Europe, it was 10mins in and out for me."

We also purchased the photographer licence. Otherwise you would not be able to take pictures.Due to their winter time the place closed at 4pm. But when we went the Cathedral were closing at 12pm due to repair works. Also, most of the big tour group follows the route of castle, cathedral..etc. Therefore to avoid the tour group crowds we would recommend to visit the Cathedral first.Definitely recommend to visit and it shouldn't be missed out, especially the stained glass created by Alphonse Mucha father of Art Nouveau.We also recommend to get concert tickets once you arrived at the castle rather pre-book. As it was winter time, definitely wear thick clothing as there is no heater throughout the concert. Definitely take a blanket and cushions to sit on."

Unfortunately, I didn't do enough research before going to know that the church didn't open until noon on Sunday, but I figured I'd just walk around the other castle areas until then. I ended up purposely waiting for noon to roll around so that I could see the inside of the church, but when I went back over there was a line probably about 1/3 of a mile long or more. I decided to forgo going inside because I absolutely hate being pushed around in a crowd (which had already been happening the entire day), but the outside is truly beautiful. The architecture is stunning and I'm sure the inside was as well. I'd recommend either (a) not going on a Sunday, or (b) preparing yourself for a mob of tourists - at least in summer."

We did not pay extra for the audio guide because I had my handy dandy Rick Steves' book with me that explained what we were looking at. If you don't have anything like that, then I would get the audio guide as well. The view of the side of the church as you come up to it is a wonderful photo opportunity to get the entire church in your frame. The dark church against the greenery is stunning."

There is an interesting exhibit that discusses and displays the gargoyles...many were able to be restored. The exterior dominates the entire city and can be seen from almost anywhere. We went to number II to see the interactive history of the castle and it is quite impressive. There are lots of cafes and restaurants on the grounds and most of them are quite good.

But once you're in the building itself, you'll forget all about THAT! Most of the windows are not stained, but the ones that are, are glorious, and the light shining through throws colors all over the floor and the people on it, making for a very cinematic visual experience. We didn't have time to explore much, but what we saw was superb, especially all those Gothic arches meeting each other in row after row of ribbed vaulting very, very far overhead. There is a tram that stops just across the street from the Castle complex entrance, which is a better way to go than the taxi we took; taxis can't get that close, and of course they cost more. Definitely worth a long afternoon, especially with all the other things to see, including the Castle."

Visit one of the many ticket offices in Prazsky Hrad to get a pass to all of the buildings - there are different tickets you can get but I believe all tickets include the cathedral. It can get very crowded with tourists around midday, so I recommend going early morning or late afternoon/early evening before closing. The stained glass and high ceilings are unbelievably beautiful, and St. Wenceslas Chapel is very special to Czech history."

Built over a 600 year period, ending 1929, however that does not in any way take away from the beauty of a largely Gothic piece of architectural brilliance. The exterior is covered in dozens of gargoyles, all of differing designs. The gothic spires add a feel to the Cathedral that makes it breathtaking to view, and for the photographer, a shot at every angle. The doors have amazingly detailed cooper engravings, and even more detailed stonework above and around.The interior is what you imagine a medieval church to be. Not sure if was incense, or just the church, but looking down the church it appeared it have a smoking presence drifting through the air. Stupidly high vaulted ceilings supported by pillars. Probably at least a dozen different chapels surrounding the main nave of the church. The crests of the Electors surround the top, under a beautiful ceiling similar to that in Prague Palace, Graz Catherdal and many others in the area. St Wenceslas's tomb is sadly roped off, so hard to get a good look but what you can see is worth the visit alone. Around the walls of his chapel are amazing medieval baroque paintings, with more references to the Electors of the HRE - that was my greatest dissappointment not fully being able to appreciate these paintings. There were gravestones of many of the early pre-Habsburg rulers on the walls, along with with their bodies in the royal crypt (unviewable), which added a feeling of age to the place. I could go on, but I know there are many of reviews and easy to look up in a guidebook. The thing you need to know is that if you only visit one building in Prague, St Vitus Catherdal is it. I am a big fan of gothic architecture, and more so history - i spent 1 1/4 hours inside (not including a couple outside), and i needed at least another hour. I was only starting to get the feeling of the place, but closing time arrived.I would upload photos but were i am has v bad wifi. A MUST SEE!"

It was incredibly crowded with tour group after tour group within an hour of opening. Since I was alone, it was easy to slip between and around groups.

We have visited cathedrals all over Europe and usually they are beautiful but very, very dark. This one has tons of light coming in through spectacular stained glass windows (before noon on a sunny day, at least.) And it is not as dark as usual.The Castle district is a must to visit but BUY A TRAM TICKET (Tram 22) that covers the ride both ways. About 50 Krowns. It's tough to find a ticket machine in the Castle area; the return ticket precludes that problem. Note: The operators of the Castle District (including this church) should ask ALL Tour Guides for a favor: Don't let your 50 people block the entire aisle. Not everyone wants to wait five minutes to get by while you give a history lesson about the altar, for example, in Russian or Chinese. In truth this is a problem in the Old City as well; they walk down a street, filling it wall to wall (roadway and both sidewalks) .... not allowing anyone to pass. If you are going in the opposite direction, the people in the group are very surly that you are walking through their mob. (I guess you are expected to get into a store and wait five minutes until they have moved away from this area??)"

Some of the stained glass is superb, notably the wonderful window designed by Mucha. A second problem, for elderly people, is that there is nowhere to sit down: the pews are blocked off. So even if you would like to sit and meditate on the beauty, you cannot do so. You are warned! The famous St. Wenceslas Chapel is difficult to see as you are not allowed inside, just to view from the doorways. The outside is lovely, especially the medieval golden decoration of the South gate."

In the afternoon it was very crowded but worth it to climb to the top of the tower (263 steps, 150 crowns) and see the view. But then I went back at 10:30 pm, when you can't go in any buildings but the grounds are still open (they stay open until midnight). It was wonderfully empty and the cathedral is even more beautiful when lit up at night. I highly recommend going at night; my friend and I just sat on the benches right by the cathedral and saw maybe only 30 people over the course of an hour (who all came and went fairly quickly, so sometimes there was no one else)."

It best feature is the St. Wenceslas chapel where the relics of the saint are kept. Outside in the front the facade is incredible.

We were there with a guide which is highly recommended because there are so many stories about this huge church. If you want to see the whole church, there is an entrance fee. The flying buttresses, the gargoyles, the various side altars are all great stories. Most of the windows were destroyed during the war and have been re-done by modern artists. A must see is the window by Alfons Mucha! There are cafes around when you get tired of walking and sightseeing though our cappuccino cost about $7!"

If you only visit one large, ornate church in Prague (and there are a lot of them to choose from), please make it this one. You won't be disappointed. There are 2 types of entry : free (you can only access the rear part of the church) and paid (you get to walk all the way down to the altar area. And when I say \"all the way...\" I mean it. This place is huge). I took the free option, but next time, maybe I'll pay for the walk and the extra view. Breathtaking. At the rear area at least, cameras were not banned, as they are in some churches - just no flash allowed. And the attendants *will* reprimand you sharply if you do use a flash. I strongly urge you to take the time to visit this place."

Once inside, the stained glass windows are beautiful and colourful, with a spectacular tomb of a local king/prince as something else worth seeing. But for me, the highlight was the relics of \"Good King Wenceslas\" in the side chapel. Externally, the building is impressive, but hard to get decent views of as it is within the castle complex so surrounded by other buildings on 3 sides. Sadly, no information in the church - just references to an audio guide number, so either rent an audio guide, or take a guide book with you."

And.... no queue! Once you are in there, it simply takes your breath away. The most amazing stained glass windows I have ever seen.

This cathedral is an excellent example of Gothic architecture and is the biggest and most important church in the country.

What makes the cathedral so special for me, is the excellent preservation. You can imagine the Czech Crown and gentry sitting here during mass."

            "review": "Beautiful, but a little confusing. The best tip I can give for anything Prague Castle-related is to plan on spending tow half days there. I say this because it will be VERY crowded in the mornings, however, your tickets are good for two days. So, if you go in the mid to late-afternoon, you can still visit three or four locations before they close up, and you can return the following day to finish up your tour. That's the best way to visit this attraction.Over a week after visiting, I'm still a little confused as to the concept of \"Prague Castle\". I'm thinking it should be called \"Prague Castle Compound\", or \"Collection of Buildings Near Prague Castle\", because the jewel of the \"compound\" is St. Vitus Cathedral.Sure, the other buildings are equally impressive, but it's St. Vitus you see from the bridge, it's St. Vitus that greets you as you emerge from the tunnel, and it's St. Vitus that has the biggest impact, and the most wow factor.Yes, if it's crowded, you're going to run into a wall of people at the mouth of the tunnel, who will all be doing what you really want to be doing, too - standing there, staring up at and taking pictures of the magnificent exterior of St. Vitus.It's impossible not to be stopped in your tracks by this beautiful building. As I said, it's the first thing you see when you exit the tunnel, and it dominates your view. But please remember - there are other people who are trying to get around you, so try not to take root as you're taking pictures. Snap a few, then move off to the side so that others can either pass, or - more likely - also stop to get a few pictures taken.The interior is just as stunning as the exterior. It's cool and beautiful inside, and even if it gets crowded (and it WILL get crowded), you should still be able to move around freely.There are a ton of really beautiful displays and exhibits within St. Vitus, but most of them lack English translations. It would be easy to get lost in the little nooks, reading about the importance of a display, or how old a relic is, but it's not always possible.Still, it's a nice way to spend an hour or so, and the stained glass windows are fantastic."

I will not rate the Prague castle experience very high and the only things worth seeing inside the premises are the Golden lane and St Vitus cathedral. Hence will advise travellers to buy their entrace tickets using caution."

We gasped when we entered the cathedral since it is so awe inspiring.It is truly awesome in its height and gothic design.One senses the cathedral's importance as soon as one enters because of its height, design and decorations. It has been the place where the coronation of the Czech kings took place in the past.It is the largest church in Prague.At the centre of the cathedral is the tomb of the most important patron saint Wenceslas, where there is a beautiful chapel, adorned with original wall paintings. It is a truly beautiful cathedral, with a distinctive aura and a resplendent design.I recommend visiting it, if there's only one building in the Prague Castle complex, you can visit on your trip.One can also climb up the church tower for an awesome view of Prague, but we really didn't have the legs nor the time to do so."

Although it was obviously a shower that would pass quickly the staff and church ushers insisted, despite everyone's pleas, on forcing the visitors (some old people and families with young children) who were temporarily sheltering in the church entrance out into the terrible weather. I asked myself whether Jesus (their boss) would have taken this attitude! Outrageous behaviour, so much for Christian compassion and the humanity of the Church"

The Cathedral is very crowded with tour groups, so go early if possible. There's not a lot of room for maneuvering between the walls and the cathedral, and you'll want to be sure to walk all the way around it--where you enter is not the front of the cathedral (if you walk up the hill from the long stairway), it is the side, so be sure to go around to the front for a beautiful view."

In a way, the Architect wanted people know that Church is something you can't tangle with. And the people visiting the church would have been scared.

Speaking from the experience of a very close call.The ornate tomb of Jan Nepomuk is made of solid shining silver - tons of it. Incredibly detailed beautiful work of art. You can't help but wonder, if it could be duplicated in modern times.The Royal Crypt is located steps down, the remains of Bohemian Royals are buried there, Charles IV among them.

The guards at the front gate really set the standard for what is a beautiful, official, well looked-after attraction. Like the rest of the city, it was bustling with tourists, but not in a crowded and annoying way. There was almost a hushed appreciation over the place. Some areas were closed however, and one gate was closed while we were admiring the view; forcing us to go back up a narrow set of stairs and a steep hill, which was a problem and we had 2 wheelchair users in our group. However, it is worth the visit for the view alone. Our visit certainly resulted in some beautiful photographs!"

This cathedral contains the remains of many royals and especially Saint Wenceslaus and the arm of Saint Vitus - if you are into body parts.Every 8 years the Crown Jewels are displayed. The front contains the usual rose window and this one a tower on either side. The marble floor consists only of brown and white tiles. There are many stain glass windows, several contain much green glass, which is quite unusual. It is nice to have a terrific view of the city, but I though that the church was for the people, who usually ended up paying for it, this one is next to the Royal Castle and behind tall stone walls. However, most tripadvisors really love it - and that is most important thing.Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

You can go into the foyer of the church and have a limited view of the church, but you must pay to walk through the entire church. We have been to many churches in the world, and I have to say I think this is the first that charged a fee. Granted on some special occasions other churches had limited access, but never charged a fee. So for that reason alone, I give it Average as opposed to Excellent. There are plenty of other fees in the Caster Area, like Golden Lane, which should bring in enough money to keep this church free of charge for entry. On that note, though, the entire area around the Castle complex, was immaculate. And that says a lot with all of the people we saw smoking and just throwing their cigarette butts, among dropping other litter. It was a lot like Disney with people walking around sweeping up litter.

In other words it is very high so if you suffer from any infirmity do not try to climb up to it. Depending on which way you go there are either steep hills or hundreds of steps. We chose the steps and it was hard going for an unfit middle aged Irishman! The Cathedral is a magnificent building set in the middle of the Castle.To be honest it was the best part of the castle experience for me and my advice is even if you are short of time don't miss St. Vitus Cathedral. As for the rest I cannot improve on the comments of other reviewers. Go and Enjoy!"

The cathedral has beautiful rose windows, the stained glass is bright and vibrant and each of the relics are so nicely displayed. Walking around in this beautiful church, although busy with vistors, was very relaxing and peaceful. If you visit in the winter time it provides a nice warm resting place during your visit around the castle. Light a candle while you visit and soak in the beauty of this spiritual place!Definatlely something to visit! Do not pass up!"

Words can't even begin to describe the grandness of this place. It sits on the castle grounds and story itself is pretty impressive. According to the tour guide, it took 800 yrs to finish the cathedral and you can see why. I can't recall the price to view the cathedral but I know it wasn't that expensive. This is a site to really take your time and enjoy. You can easily take most of the day between the cathedral and the castle grounds. There are plenty of things to do and several places to eat. Also they have some pretty amazing spots for pictures. One in particular is when you pay to climb up the stairs to where the church bell sits, take your time because it's 200 plus stairs, I think. Once you reach the top you get a 360 degree view from the city, so don't forget your tennis shoes and camera!"

It appears in front of you when you go inside the Prague castle. There is around 30m gap between the base of the cathedral and the entrance from the front of the castle. And you literally look up to see. It is so big! A fabulous construction. When you walk to the square on the right side, there is space to go away and look at it. Absolute pleasure! And for those who have seen the Cologne cathedral, it will surely remind you of the giant from Germany. And then you can ponder down into the history of Prague and how it is so well connected with Deutschland.I would suggest take a whole round of the cathedral. Many people walk from right side and go ahead. I think the left side, which is shady, is also worth a look."

We didn't go inside very deep, but I know that the skull of King Wenceslas is somewhere inside. Wandering outside it just as fun.

Plus, if you are late returning the guides, no deposit for you. All that aside, the cathedral was gorgeous. It was a little crowded but not so much that we couldn't enjoy it.

Admission is free and the easiest way to get here is via the Metro Line A (green) to Malostranska, then walk uphill along Valdstejnska and Thunovska to arrive at the Prague Castle. It's actually the cathedral's tall steeples that people think is the \"Prague Castle,\" since there isn't really a castle, but merely a large complex housing the St.Vitus Cathedral, Old Royal Palace (home to the Czech President), and St.George Basilica. If anything, the castle is worth visiting because it's the hallmark of Prague, and along the way, peek inside the cathedral as well."

This may be a bit of a problem in January when the church is actually colder inside than the biting wind outside. My friend had a hard time with this and was freezing by the time we left. That said, this church feels absolutely huge inside due to the soaring ceilings. They just go up and up and up. It's beautiful. The windows, especially the Mucha window, are gorgeous and lush, even in the overcast winter time. The tomb of St. Wenceslas is there, and worth a visit. The entrance and a short distance in is a free visit, but if you want to see the sights or the rest of the church, you've got to buy a ticket before you enter. There are two types of tickets, one for fewer \"castle hill\" attractions and one for more, and both include the large castle. One's about 250 crowns, the other about 350, if I recall correctly. The Mucha window is hard to see from the free side. I think it's unfortunate to ask people to buy a ticket for a church, but that is the way of it in some places. It helps with the cost of restoration and maintenance, which cannot be small. I thought it was worth the price of admission for the cathedral plus the castle. They are right against each other and inside guarded gates, so it makes sense that they are one large agglomerated tour site. If you go at the right time, you can watch the changing of the guard in the castle area."

When you're walking up, it looks nice, but when you walk through to the courtyard just under the main door, it takes your breath away. This is an absolutely stunning cathedral. I would recommend paying the fee to go inside and to go up in the north tower. The view from the tower is well worth it and the inside of the church is magnificent. You can walk in for free, but in order to get past the back part, you have to pay the fee. It's worth it. I probably could have spent an entire day just exploring inside and outside of the cathedral. It was truly a beautiful structure."

It gets very crowded very fast when the tour groups start showing up and you'll hear the tour guides speaking into their microphones despite the signs asking for quiet, so it can get a bit noisy as well. We went when it first opened, so it was much quieter and we could stroll around more. The St Wenceslaus Chapel was very impressive. I wish the crypt had been open. The sign said it was closed for technical reasons. I was disappointed about it's physical location relative to the palace in terms of getting a photo from the front. It's very difficult to get the entire cathedral from the very front, but you still can get tons of great photos. The cathedral was included in the B-pass option we purchased, which also included the Old Palace, St George's Basilica, and the side street with all the little houses."

This is the easiest way unless you have your own car in which I have no idea where parking is. :)If you don't plan to go with a tourist guide, read up on the history and architecture of the Cathedral to have better appreciation of the place.

It is nothing short of monumental, and the history of the cathedral is as engaging as the physical building. You have access to most of the cathedral for free, as a visitor. If you are attending mass, the entire building is open free of charge. If you go during winter, understand that the building is quite cold. Dress for the weather. If you are attending midnight mass, arrive at least an hour early if you expect to get a seat. The few pews fill up by 23:15, but there is plenty of standing room. That said, I strongly advise against wearing heels. The mass is in Czech, as are the hymnals, but they translate the first reading to English and the feeling of the mass is the same. All in all, I strongly recommend a visit."

Beautiful stained glass and a striking structure from almost any interior angle in which you gaze. Amazing wood sculpted doors and over the top crypts. The exterior of the structure is massive, and I had a hard time finding a spot even with a wide angle lens to get the whole thing in frame. It's classic neo gothic abound with flying buttresses and gargoyle scuppers. Ya gotta love gothic. St. Vitus being part of the castle complex, is I believe, the nicest part of that castle complex and the most deserving of the majority of your time there. While I've been in much more impressive cathedrals, this one is still deserving of a visit."

As a result the stained glass from the transept moving westward to the rose window is rather new compared to many European cathedrals. While newer, it is not modernistic. It is fairly traditionally designed bit the colors exhibit a vibrancy rarely seen in stained glass works. This feature alone makes the cathedral well worth a visit."

In the 2nd half of the 11th century duke Spytihn\u011bv II. founded in this place romanesque basilica, the grave of duke Wenceslas was preserved. In 1344 Charles IV.founded here the St.Vitus cathedral. The first designer was Matthias of Arras, the second one Peter Parler of Gm\u00fcnd - their designes are in gothic style. There is several chapels in cathedral, one of them contains the dead body of duke Wenceslas at the former place. P.Parler created the net vault, the first one at the continent of Europe. Parler sons built the gothic part of the tower, the renaissance parapet of that tower was built by Hans Tirol and Bonifaz Wohlmut, the baroque roof by Niccolo Pacassi of Vienna. The west part of cathedral was built in 19th and 20th century in neogothic style by J.Kranner, J.Mocker and K.Hilbert. The whole cathedral was opened in 1929."

A warning: it has around 300 steps in a tightly wound circular staircase, so would not be a good option for those with physical limitations. But the views from the top are the best we saw in Prague.

The magnificent window designed by Alfonse Mucha contributes greatly to the beauty of this church. We visit every time we are in Prague, as it is obviously a major tourist attraction. I was very surprised that on one of our previous visits in December, the Cathedral was almost empty during an early Sunday morning mass. We took a taxi up the hill from our hotel and it was great to be in the Castle area early in the morning. We were even able to take photos with no other tourists in them. How great is that?"

St. Vitus is the main draw to the castle complex and in my opinion one of the top 3 things you must see in Prague (the others being Old Town Square and the Charles Bridge). The cathedral is massive and historic \u2013 I recommend you buy the ticket that allows you to enter as the inside is more amazing than the outside architecture. It is filled with beautiful stained glass windows, gold sculptures, angels/cherubs, tombs and murals. The altar and organ are amazing and the main window reminds me of Notre Dame in Paris it is that awesome. Must see."

At least you will see the exterior and if you are an architecture lover - you have no chance to pass by. If you go inside you will encounter a very monumental building with gorgeous windows(Easter egg: 2 of them contain advertising) and columns that go up to the roof. The problem you can discover is lack of walking space. There is a tiny walkway going around and if too many people enter the cathedral you can find yourself slamming through the crowd listening to a guide. But no matter what this place is a MUST in Prague!"

The 1931 stained glass window designed by Czech artist Alphonse Mucha, for example, is my favorite part of the whole cathedral - full of typical Mucha style, but also faithful to its surroundings."

There are many group tours inside so be careful to try and stay ahead of a group to ensure you see everything that you want. The architecture of the building is very striking and the building is very old. I thought the Cathedral was the best thing in the entire castle complex.

When I heard that Mucha did one of the St Vitus stained glass windows, I had to make sure and see that when I went to the castle hill. It was beautiful! I am so glad that I got to see that.When you get into the castle grounds, make sure you get a tour ticket. There are different options for the tours. You can go into the cathedral without a ticket, but you can't go around the sides and get near the stained glass windows or see some of the other unique aspects of the cathedral. There are many amazing artistic monuments and old alcoves that are beautiful to see."

The cathedral was built over the course of over 600 years, starting at the altar end, and you can visualize the different eras as you view it from the side. The Rosetta window on the rear of the building is kaleidoscope-like, with many stained glass panels.

You don't even have to be Catholic to appreciate the passion that went into such pieces of art.The exterior is equally impressive with its mosaic and intricate grill work. Our guide also told us that different sections of the church were done in different architectural styles.

If you don't purchase a ticket, you will only be able to look at the central nave from the very back. We had the audio guide, and it helped for a few things here as there were no written guides inside the church as there were inside the other sites. As with any audio guide, it may be more info that what you want, but you can turn it off; at least it's something.

Waiting in line outside affords time to marvel at the exterior workmanship, complete with gargoyles and carvings. The interior abounds with beauty beyond sufficient words. One can spend hours poring over the stained glass alone, alas if you tire quickly of crowds this is not the ideal place for you. Even in shoulder season during a weekday we were jostled about by multitudes of people visiting the cathedral. It is hard to fathom the scene during high season!

Done by famed master-artist Alphonse Mucha, the color in the glass is vivid and fluid, magenta and turquose and purple and ruby red and orange and marigold and blue and violet. Absolutely stunning. And the imagery are painting-quality, telling stories, with lots of movement and fantastic composition! Seriously. I've seen about 30 churches and cathedrals and basilicas in Europe.

Before you enter the cathedral through the portal opposite the passage-way between the Second and Third Courtyards of Prague Castle, notice the facade, decorated with statues of saints. Then, admire the bronze door , which is decorated with reliefs with scenes from the history of the cathedral and the legends of St. Wenceslas and St. Adalbert. The interior of the cathedral is nothing short of amazing! Inside the cathedral's busy main body are several chapels, the most celebrated chapel, on your right, is the Chapel of St. Wenceslas, which is built atop the saint's tomb. A multitude of polished semiprecious stones decorates the chapel's altar and walls. Below the church's main body is the Royal Crypt, which contains the sarcophagi of kings V\u00e1clav IV, George of Podebrady, Rudolf II, and Charles IV and his four wives.The views from the cathedral's tower are amazing on a clear day. You must exit the cathedral and enter from the courtyard side to climb the steep winding staircase. A sepateate ticket is required, and can be purchased at the entrance to the stairs. Try to get here early, before the crowds, as the steep, narrow stairway is the only way up and down the tower.You'll be glad you made the climb."

Yet a partial view of such a monolithic church isn\u2019t sufficient. It is an unusual Cathedral. Along the bottom half of the sanctuary, there are surreal, psychedelic stained glass windows alternating with traditionally representational tableaux.Off to the side behind a door, there is a small chapel that featured a startling bas relief of three main figures: Jesus unconscious on the cross, with his mother Mary and Mary Magdalene on either side beneath him. Jesus is emaciated. He has just a smidgen of flesh on his rickety rib cage. His mother is dejected. She looks downward. But Mary Magdalene adoringly, almost voluptuously looks up at Jesus as if she senses that his death is only temporary; his glory is forever.Normally, a magnificent altarpiece is the focal point of a sanctuary, but not at St. Vitus. Considering how spacious this gothic cathedral is, the short, plainly adorned altarpiece portraying a nondescript Virgin Mary is almost unobtrusive. But behind the altarpiece and overshadowed by it is a baroque silver-coated extravaganza. Two huge angels hover in mid-air, holding red drapery above the statue of an oversized saint (St. John of Bohemia) who is kneeling on a bier upheld by two other angels. He is cradling a cross that looks like a sword and contains a large figurine of the inlaid body of Jesus upon it. This monumental scene could have served well as the centerpiece of the Cathedral.Further on in the back of the Cathedral is a richly paneled chapel containing wall-to-wall paintings, the upper portion devoted to St. Wenceslas, the patron saint of the Czech nation. The d\u00e9cor resembles that of a palatial museum touting a precious exhibition room rarely found in a church.The worst unusual aspect of the Cathedral has to do with the staff. As we were near the end of our visit, we wanted to go back to see a few more items. An officious attendant said no, you must go forward; you can never backtrack in the Cathedral. That\u2019s the rule. We were shocked. We told him that this so-called policy is absurd. He replied, \u201cNo, no, no Madame. I\u2019m only following orders.\u201d And then he told a whopper: \u201cAll churches are this way, everywhere.\u201d In any case, as another attendant began to join the fray, we exited. We would have lingered a bit longer. If you want to see everything from all vantage points, simply walk around each area as you go, because if you approach the end, you will be stopped from turning around. A bit absurd!!"

We entered and found ourselves in the massive vaulted cathedral. There were enormous stained glass windows of flowers and religious figures. There were numerous curios such as the internal medieval staircase and balconies and balustrades. On one side was the enormous section of the organ pipes tucked high up in the rafters. The cathedral was not as crowded as we expected as we had gone early. Construction started in 1347 although there was a basilica on the site one hundred years earlier. The program of works to restore, extend or add renaissance flourishes meant that it was not actually finished until 1920. At the far end was a number of sarcophagi but the royal tomb was closed. Accessed from outside the cathedral was the South Tower. It was a steep spiral staircase but the steps were broad enough to be comfortable. There were 290 of them and the tower was a whopping ninety-six metres tall. On the way we were looking for both the bell and the workings of the clock that you were supposed to be able to see. The bell was supposed to be the largest in Czech. We think we saw the bell, as we could only look through a small window along the staircase and without a proper platform to observe it. At the top was a nice view without any impediments from screens or wire. We had a good vantage point over the top of St Vitus Cathedral and the castle itself. It was quite funny how the tour groups in the courtyard below seemed relatively spaced out and insignificant, but it helped when they were one hundred metres below. We also had good views over Petrin and the city of Prague.Whilst the cathedral opens at 9.00am the tower does not open until 10.00am and is not covered by the Circuit A ticket."

I'm usually a great fan of climbing cathedral towers for the view on top, but this tower was particularly unpleasant to climb - there were barely any windows and all of them were sealed shut (never meant to be open) and there was almost no air left to breathe (moreover it was on a very hot summer day). From the top you get a wonderful 360 view over most of Prague. It wasn't too crowded at the top despite the vast amount of tourists visiting the castle complex daily. However. I'd recommend climbing it on a cooler day or season."

It is a exuberantly Gothic, possibly the best example of Gothic cathedral architecture in Central/Eastern Europe. Lots of great art and interesting architectural details inside and out. But wait, there's more! Because the cathedral took centuries to complete, there are some interesting modern items of interest, such as the stained glass windows in the north part of nave designed by the Art Nouveau master Alfons Mucha. And then there's the opulently adorned tomb of St. Wencelaus (yes, the same \"Good King Wenceslas [who] looked out, on the Feast of Stephen, When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even...).

Hidden within Prague Castle complex, the cathedral is accessible free of charge but only the first 10 m, after that ticket must be scanned at the barrier. In common with the rest of Prague Castle, there was too many people to allow any sense that one was in a church. No music was played, even over loud speakers, which was a shame, as this invariably adds atmosphere. One was not allowed to sit down - all the pews were roped off - not good news for my disabled husband who ended up sitting on the wall outside."

The cathedral was commissioned by Charles IV, and construction began in 1344 ...However, it took almost six centuries to complete, with the final phase of construction in the period 1873-1929, it is the largest and most important temple in Prague...In the chancel of the cathedral, in front of the high alter, is the royal mausoleum. Below this, there are the royal tombs. Czech kings and queens, and patron saints of the country are interred here.The Great South Tower of the Cathedral holds the biggest bell in the Czech Republic you can climb the tower. It has 287 steps and is more than 90 metres high. The views from the stop are worth the effort.It is free for visitors to enter the first part of St. Vitus Cathedral. A ticket must be purchased to visit the whole cathedral."

However, once I entered the St Vitus, it hits me that this is probably the most beautiful cathedral that I have came across. The tinted glass facades around the building are very beautiful as they are shone brightly perhaps by the natural sunlight. It is difficult to put the beauty of this place to words. You have to visit this place to experience itDo note that if you are visiting, avoid Sunday as certain compound are closed to visitors."

Great spires, reliefs and artwork, you will not be disappointed by it. During the day hours it gets packed pretty quick. We also came back to it at night about 9pm (our hotel was 300 yards away) and it was awesome all lit up, there was not many people there until the groups of 50ppl started showing up, but still easier to see than in the day time. I would highly recommend it.*Most of the reviews say that the Cathedral is free, that isn't entirely true. ENTRY into it is free and allows you to look at the front 1/4 of the church, the back 3/4 are roped off and you need to pay or be part of a paid tour group. We didn't go into the roped off area, not because of the price but because we were not sure how to do it and we were also running out of time. Something I would love to do though and recommend.**Warning: Just because it's a church do not drop your guard and BE MINDFUL OF YOUR BELONGINGS! There are a lot of people bumping and touching you and you will be pre-occupied with the surroundings. Make sure your purse/backpacks are zipped and in front of you, wallets in front, camera cases stowed well. Just be mindful so you can really enjoy the beautiful art work & history that you see."

We did get some great in-depth information, about the door and the story that it tells. We also learned that the painted window in the church was done by the artist, Alphonse (sometimes spelled Alfons) Mucha. The design and colors were incredible! Thanks to this discovery, we wanted to see more of his work, so we ventured to the National Gallery, to see the \u201cThe Slav Epic\u201d (which was a must)."

It is a bit jarring to see an Art Nouveau work in a cathedral from the Middle Ages, but it is so beautiful that it works here. At the apse do not miss the relief of 17th century Prague and the tombs of St. Vitus and St. John Nepomuk. The later tomb is made of solid silver. Before the exit, do not miss the Chapel St. Wenceslaus."

Once you're through the barriers into the Cathedral proper, you might be surprised at how much of its majesty remains even as crowds swarm around you. The architecture is as stunning inside the cathedral as it is out, contains a fascinating range of tombs and relics, including the relics of St Wenceslas, along with a stained glass window designed by Alphonse Mucha. Arriving early might give you a few extra minutes of solitude, but don't expect it to last - or for the crowds to really be a problem."

Really awe inspiring for both adults and kids (10+). Only thing I'd suggest is taking the tram (#22) to the top and entering via the gardens rather than getting off early and walking up the steps. Its not just the steps, its the crowds. Taking the tram to the top gives you fresh legs to walk through the very interesting gardens while approaching the Cathedral from an alternative point of view."

My partner and I had to come back twice as we were just in awe. This means alot to me as I am not a big fan of Gothic, rather I am more of a baroque person. Though an external part of this cathedral was being renovated at that time we visited, it was compensated by the other facets and angles of this magnificent structure.It can get crowded inside, I suppose we need to see this again at a less touristy season."

The cathedral is a must see as it is one of the few gothic churches Prague has, aside from the Baroque. As other reviewers have noted it is a little difficult to take photos of the exterior as you are lodged between buildings, but if you lie on the floor like I did, you will get a great picture! Worth the money (it is cheap), the time and the climb up the hill. This is a must see in Prague!"

The difference is that this cathedral is much more Gothic in design and the architecture is definitely more unique. Inside is impressive as well so its worth the visit. Taking photos of the building outside is challenging since the building is super tall that the square surrounding it is small so a wide angle lens is needed. Even with that the photo angles dont make for great photos. Lots of things surrounding the Cathedral so buy the \"A tour ticket\" and the audio tour for the most impact. Keep in mind that you must put a deposit for the audio tour in cash ($50 euro per device) although the tickets for the entrance can be put on credit cards."

The detailed chapel decorations are 13th or 14th century at a guess. Outside the flying buttresses and gargoyles demand one's attention as does the Golden Gate above which is a 14th century mosaic of the Final Judgement.

Especially, the big stained glasses were beautiful because of its clear pictures, different from the normal stained glasses showing Jesus. Since a lot of persons were asked or sometimes scolded by security persons for their using flash when taking pictures by cameras, we should check if the camera is not in an automatic mode, which is flashing in the dark church."

A very interesting (and unusual) story is that each window was made by a different artist. One of the artists (apparently the most famous one -- forgot his name) decided he would not only work his window in a different style but also paint the name of his sponsor (a bank) in the bottom right corner of the window. I've never seen that in a church and apparently this was accepted for the reputation this artist had in that time."

I'm not a very religious person but, I do love going around the Worlds Cathedrals, Mosques, Temples etc, and admiring the sheer beauty of the buildings, not to mention how on Earth they managed to construct such aspiring works of art that have stood the test of time. When you consider they didn't posses such things like computers, slide rules, heavy machinery etc. truly remarkable indeed.Now St Vitus Cathedral is one of those magnificent places that you just have to visit while in Prague, and it's not easy to miss either due to it's location within the massive Prague castle which dominates the landscape for miles around. This was always the reason as they could intimidate and control the simple masses below keeping them in line, plus making sure the taxes were paid on time too, As you enter the Castle make sure you head straight for the Cathedral around early afternoon armed with a good guide book, or purchase a map as I did which has some very colourful descriptions of the Cathedral, as the dreaded tour groups have usually departed and are being marched elsewhere, I found this was the best time to visit and we did strike lucky as there was no queue either. For a small fee you can enter and explore this ancient wonder, now make sure you don't pay for the full package at the outside ticket office which covers the entire castle area as I found this to be way too expensive and plus a lot of the palaces have limited access etc. Better to pay small fees for what YOU want to see and avoid possible tour group queues.Now going around this Cathedral one is taken in with the grand splendour of the cavernous Cathedral including the colourful stained glass windows, crypts, the high alter, the Alfonse Mucha window is worth the admission price alone here. I have to admit I was blown away with this stunning Cathedral and I've seen plenty in my time including the Dom cathedral in Cologne, also the huge one in Palma. Constant reminders of a bygone era in people control before the arrival of 21st century media brainwashing, just enjoy the moment in quiet reflection before returning to the madness outside..!"

            "review": "Must-see attraction in Praha: avoiding crowds is key. I'm guessing that many of the somewhat negative reviews of St. Vitus stem from overcrowding. The timing of your visit is key. Huge convoys of tour buses come in mid-morning. Unless you're going to be first in line, I suggest going in the late afternoon after the tour buses stop. I arrived at the Castle at 2pm and encountered no line-ups. Mind you, this was in late April (off-season), but that's true for some of the negative reviews as well.Upon arriving at the Castle, go immediately to the Cathedral to assess how long the line-up is to enter. Then go to the ticket counter to assess that line-up. Knowing the hours that venues close will help you determine when the best time is to line up. There's certainly lots to see and photograph outside without having to pay any fee at all. But if the lines are reasonable, it is definitely worth the extra money to view the reserved area of the cathedral.The highlight of the cathedral is the stained-glass window by Alfons Mucha, as well as the high altar. However, it is the bare bones of this gothic cathedral that are truly spectacular. I toured the Cathedral in under 45 minutes, as crowds were limited. I used my Rick Steves tourbook, not an audioguide, but I do think you'll need some kind of extra information to make the tour worthwhile.Outside, you can take lots of photos of the spires and gargoyles, but be sure to catch the large mosaic. You can also pay to climb the tower, but unless you have a powerful camera, you might want to save your money, especially if you're going to be paying for other views such as that from the mini-Eiffel Tower."

Beautiful stain glass windows, ornate silver cherubs, crypts, altars, and much more will impress you as well as it did to its patrons long ago.

If you would like to see the cathedral and study up on it before you go there is a virtual tour on the St. Vitus Cathedral website. There is also a calendar of activities.I would allot at least an hour here in the cathedral to wander slowly through the church.

Having been taken round a lot of cathedrals by my parents when I was a child, I have had a tendency to see each and every cathedral (with the exception of the Sagrada Familia) as yet another cathedral - a repetition of the same themes, altars and votive candles. However, I found the St Vitus particularly striking. It's very beautiful and I loved the stain glass windows with the light flooding in. Gorgeous."

Interesting to see the exterior of the cathedral since it was done at different times vs being finished all at once. You are able to notice the weathering of the exterior (ash color), and instead of it being a full gothic building their are renaissance and Baroque elements too. There is a beautiful mural in the third courtyard that actually has heaven and hell depicted on it. And you can not forgot the beautiful rose stain glassed window. If I head back to Prague I would venture inside to get a glimse of the royal crypts."

It would be worth doing a guided tour of the building if you cannot read Czech as all the signs and writing on the monuments are in Czech.

However, when we went up at 2pm, it was almost empty in comparison, and therefore a much more relaxed visit. In order to see around the cathedral in its entirety (make sure to check out the beautiful stained glass designed by Mucha) you have to buy 1 of 2 types of tickets. We chose the cheaper of the two, which allowed entry into the cathedral, the old palace, golden lane and the basilica which is 250kz (around \u00a38.50), but with a student card I got in for half price! Unfortunately there isn't an option to visit just the cathedral, so make this part of your visit to the castle.My partner even made the bold claim that this was the most attractive cathedral he'd visited.

Glued to their cameras, pushing past you to rush to the next site their guide pointed out to take a few photos and then off to the next shrine or window. The guides were talking loudly and in one case clicking some kind of rattle to get attention and people were talking loudly, laughing and pulling daft poses for pictures. To me the serene atmosphere you usually find there is one of the best parts of visiting a cathedral but due to the utter lack of respect shown by tour groups that atmosphere was missing in places when we wandered round between 9 & 9:45am and seemed to have vanished entirely by 11 when we popped back in to see if we could get a better look at the stained windows near the entrance. I'm not religious in the slightest but I was a little shocked by the generally rude behaviour. That said there are some stunning little chapels, tombs and windows to see so I'd recommend going early and just waiting for any early tour groups to get past you before you move on. If you are out of peak season you may even get the odd moment you feel like you are the only person there."

Prague Castle is well worth the walk up the hill to get to it and the cathedral is within the castle grounds so your entry ticket gets you into the cathedral too. The whole area is always busy and the cathedral is especially so. However don't let that put you off as it is a fantastic sight with beautiful windows, amazing ceilings and is really light. Don't bother climbing the tower, the views from the far end of the castle are just as good."

To see all of it you need to buy a castle admission ticket which is around \u00a313 each, too expensive for this sort of attraction. But, you can see enough of the cathedral interior without paying for the extra yards. The stained glass windows were most impressive, it was a dull day but that didn't dampen the vivid colours. Well worth a visit."

You have to pay to be able to visit all parts of the cathedral, but if you do not want to, you can still go inside a short way and see the amazing stain glass windows. Outside be sure to go round to the right hand side of the castle to the original entrance, known as the Golden Portal, with the mosaic of the Last Judgement, Heaven and Hell. Be sure to check out the decorations on the fence around the Golden Portal - I am sure many visitors just walk past and do not notice the beautiful figures.We climbed the tower (287 steps) to get magnificent views of Prague and the river - you have to pay but it's not expensive and well worth the effort. You also get wonderful views of the roof of the cathedral."

But there are just some categories of tourist that are more offensive than others, I find. I try to be a low-key tourist as much as possible, and I notice a lot of other people are the same way. But there are some, SOME, who go about the place as though they have more right than anyone else in the whole world to be there, and St Vitus Cathedral seemed to be absolutely jam-packed with this particular beast. I went inside (it's beautiful both inside and out, but inside is particularly stunning) and in the space of five minutes, whilst standing and taking it in, I'd been barged into by not one, not two, but three obnoxious sorts speaking in inappropriately loud voices, two of whom were viewing the whole thing through their iPads. I was considering going out to buy the ticket to explore the whole of the Cathedral, but I was completely put off by the pushy, loud-mouthed throngs inside. It's a shame, because it really is a beautiful building."

If you get the sun shining through the stained glass windows, the colours are magnificent. Information is not readily available and many people have no idea that the beautifully decorated side chapel contains the tomb of St. Wenceslas! The stonework carvings on the outside of the building are wonderful. In over 20 years of coming to Prague, this is the first time that I could climb the stairs to the main tower, it has always been closed before (separate admission charge); if you have the energy to climb the 280+ steps to the top, you will be rewarded with the most magnificent views over the city of Prague!"

This place will only charm you if you're a frequent cathedral goer and examine every part of the cathedral on it's architecture and design of the interior and exterior. Otherwise, it's another typical cathedral to you. I'm not really a cathedral person but this cathedral has evidence of the good art work in it's frescoes and interior design. The attraction is partly free. We could go into the cathedral entrance but were stopped at the front pews. To enter the cathedral further right to the altar required a fee. This caused quite a jam at the entrance as people came in free but lingered around the entrance not wanting to pay the fee to enter right in. However if you're really interested, the fee will allow you in and this will give you access right to the altar and there are far fewer people so the viewing experience will be more pleasant. One of the things which I observed was that many may have missed the artwork on the exterior of the cathedral. Many took lots of photos of the cathedral exterior from a distance for the cathedral was huge, but didn't go up close to examine the sculptures and artwork. Again very intricately done and an equal or more effort put in compared to the interior so I would certainly recommend having a closer look at the exterior as well. 3 stars for an average visit for me."

The best thing about this place is the way to get there, you have to climb a hill, which today was very chilly, and there are several places with amazing views from Prague. I visited it a day before Christmas and most of the attractions inside Prague Castle were closed, but St. Vitus was opened and did not require a ticket to enter(not sure if it was due to the holiday). The architecture is amazing inside out, the sculptures that are part of the external area are amazing and a bit scary. The inside is also very interesting, churches in Czech Republic really seem different, the gothic lines and themes seem more present and the details all over need time to be appreciated. I believe it is always crowded, as even with the holiday and a day so cold I was asking myself why I was outside, there was a huge crowd. It is not easy to spend time really touring inside with so many people, but it is definitely worth it."

We walked through the church pretty quickly because we were not part of a tour and didn't have the audio guide. The audio guide may be worth it if you want to know more about the many statues inside the church. The best part for us was the climb up the south tower. The entrance to the tower is outside of the building and around the side from the main entrance. There is an extra fee and its 295 steps up a spiral staircase, which probably took about 15 minutes to climb, but was completely worth it! It was by far the best view of Prague and there weren't that many people at the top because its a separate ticket and a long climb. There are also benches inside the tower at the top if you need to rest after the climb."

If you go with a tour guide they will explain how the Cathedral has been repaired and added onto over the centuries and decades. The stained glass windows are eel worth seeing. The President of the Czech Republic has his offices in the Cathedral complex so watch out for official cars speeding around the square. Czech drivers don't seem to value pedestrians. The changing of the guard is worth waiting for and if you have a good tour guide they will get you to the best spot for viewing the changing and tell you exactly how close you can stand to the guards. The guards are largely ceremonial, of course, but they are armed. If you go in winter it is a couple of degrees colder at the Cathedral because there is always a breeze, so do rug up as the cold will go right through you. We were told that in summer you can hardly move around the cathedral for tourists. Prague is currently a very popular tourist destination."

Part of the chapel is a locked doorway to the chamber holding the Crown Jewels. This door has seven locks, the keys to which are held by seven different government or church officials, something some U.S. cities might consider. Now to the Treasury, which displays a fraction of the many religious treasures owned by the Cathedral. These crosses, monstrances, and reliquaries were designed and executed by the best craftsmen, who had access to gold, silver, and precious gems. Among the relics are the usual splinters from the cross but also rarer items like a swatch from the table cloth used at the Last Supper and a piece of the loin cloth Jesus wore on the cross.

Anyway, with the short trip ticket (250 CKZ) which allowed me to visit 4 locations in the Prague Castle Compound, I went to the other 4 places and could just come back to this St. Virus's Cathedral at the end. The Cathedral is huge but I really wonder that it looks like the Cologne Cathedral (Dom)! Here, all the cathedrals in Prague require entrance fee. If you have camera, the license to take picture is required. I had my DSLR camera so they asked me to pay 50 CKZ so I can bring my camera and can take pic in the Prague Castle compound."

The three most interesting to us were: A wooden relief of the city of Prague shows the result of the Battle of White Mountain where the Protestant King fled the city (see all the wagons filing along the roads and the Charles Bridge). This shows the city in the 1600's and it is fascinating to find landmarks!A silver tomb of St. John (who was thrown over the Charles Bridge) is spectacular (and notice the silver miners hovering over your shoulder). Also, the tomb of St. Vitus (you will hear many varied stories of his father torture of his son)."

However later on I found out that it was actually located within the \"Prague Castle\" compound. This would be by far the most impressive cathedral in Prague and is definitely worth a visit, especially if you only see one cathedral, make it this one.We bought the 'short visit' ticket for 250czk which included entry to: St. Vitus Cathedral, Old Royal Palace, St. George's Basilica, Golden Lane with Daliborka Tower. We paid an additional 100czk each for the english guided tour. To me at least, most cathedral looks the same so it was worthwhile to have a guild there to tell you the history behind it to make it more interesting. The most impressive thing I found about this place is how they moved stone by stone the old wall to the side to expand the cathedral to what it is today. There was a lot of alters, chapels, big grand sarcophagus all within the cathedral to allow you more things to see.The royal jewels are also located here (upstairs to the left as you face the altar) however it is off limits to the public. No doubt you've hard of \"Charlie\", lot of things are named after him in this city. Charlie is buried in this cathedral, together with his four wives. Many of whom died at child birth. On our tour we also got to go underneath the cathedral to where the crypt are located which was different to other cathedral tours that we've been on.This is one of the most popular places so expect lots of people. I didn't realise this but your ticket can only allow you a SINGLE entry into this building so if you want to take photos, you must do so during the tour otherwise you can only get back in with another ticket.CoryKPS. if you can, try to time your visit with the changing of the guards which including a fanfare and the flag ceremony. It occurs daily at 12.00 in the first courtyard and is free of charge."

There is a small chapel off to one side, the Chapel of St Mary Magdalene, in which there is a small door \u2013 locked with seven locks \u2013 leading to the Coronation Chamber above the Golden Gate, where the Bohemian crown jewels are kept. The seven keys needed to unlock the door are held separately by 7 different holders, including the President of the Republic and the Mayor of Prague."

It is also one of the few (perhaps the only) Catholic Churches in Czech that doesn't charge for entry -- what a disgusting, scandalous, detraction from the faith and Jesus' teachings, for those of us who believe in kneeling, not paying, to be able to pray."

The stained glass windows are amazing, and one designed and donated by the famous artist Mucha.

Its immense size and location on the highest point of the Castle gives it added prominence, and if you can ignore the surging crowds of tourists that throng this Cathedral, you can concentrate on the many beautiful side chapels, their glorious decoration (many in Baroque style) in carved marble, golden railings and altars, and serene paintings. Many of the Czech Republic's (Catholic) Primates are buried and commemorated here. The stained glass that decorates many - but not all - of the Cathedral's windows lend colour and serenity. Be sure to go behind the high altar for the tomb of one of the country's saints: it's the one with many silver lamps hung in the Orthodox manner above the ornate and sumptuous tomb with carved angels and heraldic designs. Much restoration has been carried out since the fall of Communism in the country, and much needs still to be done, but I guarantee that you won't be disappointed on your visit! Although some of the features have English descriptions, most do not, hence it may be advisable to hire the audio guide before you start your walk around."

In particular the side chapels are worth spending time checking out as well as the beautiful tainted glass.

Bring money to use the rest rooms. We were with a small tour company and that was essential to get a good history and discussion. It is packed with tourists, so be patient.

            "review": "A Must-See in Prague. This is a beautiful example of gothic cathedral architecture, with several small chapels around the sides of the altar area and lots of art throughout. However the stained glass windows are absolutely gorgeous and are a must-see. The cathedral is set up so that there is a free section near the doors where anyone can come in and view the architecture and some of the art from the back of the church. However if you want to see the chapels and windows, you will need to buy the entrance ticket. I found that the free area was packed and hard to walk around, but once you passed into the paid entry area the crowd thinned out a bit and you could take your time to admire the sights. There are also lots of little details on the exterior of the church that you should take a few minutes to look for. For instance, on the facade just below the rose window are carvings of the architects as a tribute to them. On the side of the church there are 3 wrought iron gates that each have 4 astrological symbol carvings as well as a small carved tableau that portrays something that people might have been doing during that astrological month. (For instance, there was a harvest tableau for one of the fall month signs.) It was really interesting to see.You can definitely see enough to appreciate the cathedral for free, but if you can only see one paid site in Prague, this should be it."

No, there is no Grand Basilica like St, Peters, and it isn't as large as the Cathedral de Sevilla, but this is a very beautiful Gothic Cathedral. I don't know if it's because it is on the hill in the Castle district, but the light is amazing. It's bright like the inside of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia (that's where the similarity ends). It has many fine works of silver, stone, and even wood- it also has beautiful stained glass windows and arches. The exteriors are awesome, and look completely different at night, actually it's well worth a trip up at night because the outside (Castle District) is free anyway. I would highly recommend making this my first stop (on the Short tour) of the Castle District. My wife and I arrived right when it opened, and it was worth it to beat the crowds."

The church is immense in scale and has the usual European monuments to rulers, patrons and saints. Of note is the tomb of St Wenceslas and St John Niemark. While the Cathedral had been built over the 800 years it has existed, the glass windows of the nave were done in the 19 and 20th century and they are awe-inspiring. The Cathedral is worth a visit as part of the Prague Castle tour."

Ufortunately most of the tourists crowds in the nave being very loud and disrespectful for the place. I'm a religious person and I was expecting an atmoshere of peace and prayer. It felt like God moved somewhere else, because there was no experience of his presence. I've been to many European cities and I've visited many important cathedrals (Paris, Cologne, Barcelona, Venice) and NEVER experience something like that. Everywhere being quiet and respectful is a condition to be allowed to enter the church. Why does anyone from the staff react to this? Bedides, there is no way you can kneel and pray for a moment, becuase the area with benches is barred and guarded. If you knelt somewhere else you would be trampled on by other visitors."

We were unable to see the Golden Portal or the crypt located below the main level. Other than the construction, be warned that the whole Prague Castle complex is especially crowded on Mondays. Most other attractions are closed on Mondays, so tourists flock to the complex."

            "review": "St. Vitus Cathedral - A Gothic Masterpiece and one of Prague's very best attractions. We recently visited Prague and spent a half day seeing the attractions within the Prague Castle grounds. The absolute highlight was seeing St. Vitus Cathedral, a Gothic masterpiece and one of our very favourite attractions in the city. St. Vitus is the largest and most important religious building in the city. The present cathedral is apparently the third religious structure to be built on this site. The earliest being a 10th century Romanesque rotunda, which was replaced by a 11th century basilica that stood on these grounds until the 13th century, when under the reign of Charles IV, the present Gothic cathedral was constructed. Additional Renaissance, Baroque and even Art-Nouveau touches have been added to St. Vitus over the centuries, however it is the Gothic aspects of this cathedral that set it apart. There is much that we like about St. Vitus. As soon as you enter the cathedral you are met with the classic long and narrow nave and a high ceiling with ribbed vaults that you typically associate with Gothic architecture. You then begin to spot many stain glass windows, which were contributed to the cathedral in the 20th century by the Art-Nouveau painter, Alfons Mucha. You can see the Mucha's windows upon entering the cathedral but you can't get as close to them until you follow the route around the cathedral and find yourself near the exit. We were lucky to have visited early in the morning and were able to watch the sun beams pierce through the window panes making the most gorgeous of lightings. This one of the most memorable parts of our visit to St. Vitus Cathedral for us. We also very much enjoyed looking into the beautifully decorated 14th century Chapel of Wenceslas, near the centre of the cathedral. While you can't walk inside, you can view into the chapel from two different directions. Within the chapel you can see precious stone crusted walls and a beautiful wall paintings supposedly reflecting scenes from the life of St. Wenceslas. Within the cathedral, you can also see the elaborately decorated silver sarcophagus known as the Tomb of St. John of Nepomuk, the religious martyr who was canonised and laid to rest at this place in St. Vitus. The tomb is of remarkable design and craftsmanship, and it reminded us of some of the Hapsburg tombs seen in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. These were the highlight features of St. Vitus that we most enjoyed and there is plenty more to see. In the end, we consider St. Vitus to be one of the very best attractions in Prague and one of our personal favourite Gothic style buildings in Europe. You can visit St. Vitus Cathedral as part of your visit to Prague Castle by purchasing the Prague Castle Long Visit (350czk) or Short Visit (250czk) combination ticket, which are good for two days so you visit the cathedral leisurely if you like, its well worth your time. We highly recommend adding this to your 'must see' list of places to visit when in Prague."

When they say they close the doors 15 minutes before it closes (I believe 4:45pm), they mean it. We saw the guards literally slam doors in people's faces right at the time.

It is challenging and may be difficult if you are not in decent shape, but if your are up to it, avoid the tram or cab and see the area by walking. The audio tour, though a bit pricing, was well worth it for the details of the historic site."

Simply observing from the outside was enough to keep me busy for about 40 minutes, finding the intricacies and the windows fascinating. Inside the cathedral, which was included on my short visit ticket, I took my time wandering slowly around the perimeter, taking note of the range of different types of art and masonry inside. One of my favourite parts was the 'stained glass window' which was actually painted glass, something some people may not even notice when walking past.St Wenceslas Chapel is extremely beautiful, the entire thing being decorated with semi-precious stones, although you may struggle to see into it through the two openings if the cathedral is crowded while you are there."

I was surrounded by more people than I care to remember, and went out of the flow for a second and was briskly moved in that right direction. So I thought \"enough of this, my mood doesn't need a downturn\", so I spun around 360 degrees, got some great photos and found that I had done what I came for, seen the amazing windows. Sometimes, you just have to know when you've seen all you can see, so I went straight out again, and I'm happy for it. It is all very fantastic, you are humbled by it all, once you get a distance to the great masses of people surrounding you. After that, the beers at the Strahov Monastic Brewery tasted so incredibly good!"

We heard from trusted Prague locals that Prague Castle is not too exciting and that it's best just to walk around outside in the evening once the daytime tourists have left. We got there after 6pm when the \"attractions\" closed, but we could still walk around. Honestly, I don't think anything would have interested us other than the cathedral. We were not allowed in, but could hear a symphony and singers so loudly, even from outside the closed doors. The acoustics must be amazing in there. Even from the outside, the cathedral is worth going up to the castle area to see. It's simply beautiful, and I'm not easily impressed. I wish we could have seen inside. I'm not religious at all, but I appreciate gothic architecture."

I want to split my review to be clear. Tower- I would give a 4/5 for this, I paid 150 koruna (about $7.50) to enter the tower and climbed what seemed like a bajillion stairs to the top. Not complaining about the stairs in general as it would be impractical to have an elevator, but I didn't see anything before indicating there would be a lot of stairs. People were stopped in different spots resting on the way up which made the narrow stair case a little more dangerous. I did find it very cool that I was given a little coin in a plastic case as a souvenir. The view was also magnificent and I got many beautiful pictures. I would say the attraction overpriced for what you get as there is the more popular Petrin Tower for great views.Cathedral - The only reason this review is 3/5 is because of the good experience at the Tower. I was extremely disappointed with this cathedral. Architecturally and aesthetically amazing, a work of art and beauty. My whole visit was ruined because there were entirely too many people inside. I have included pictures to show how awfully crowded it was. They need to not allow tour guides to stop and clog the narrow walking areas as this cause a huge back up because 2 large groups were stopped to listen to their guides and many others were trying to take pictures which contributed to the back up of traffic. If I were to rate separately it would be 2/5 for the Cathedral."

The cathedral has undergone a great deal of restoration and the various displays of the work makes you realise how much effort has been dedicated this national symbol.A guide of some sort is needed to make your visit worthwhile - the guidebooks are rather trivial and a guided tour is the only real option. To finish or 'cap' your visit a hike up the cathedral tower is more than worthwhile - but pricey and it's a heck of a long way up!

It is truly immense and has the most detailed stained glass windows we've seen on this trip. It's in the castle complex, but if you're on a limited budget you can see 99% of the good stuff from immediately inside the door.We got there by buying a day transit pass and taking the subway to a tram stop for tram 22 that has a stop across the street from the entrance to the complex. With a day pass you don't have to find a place to buy a return ticket or buy extra tickets when you board the subway.If you've found this helpful I alway appreciate a Yes vote above.Thanks for reading."

I looked online and saw that there was mass at St. Vitus on Sundays at 8:30am and 10am. My husband and I were very excited to be able to attend mass at such a beautiful cathedral. We were 7 minutes late to the 8:30am mass and the guard man said that we could not go in since we were late. We looked around the castle grounds planning to go to the 10am mass. We were going to go in around 9:40am but the man with limited English stopped us saying that only people for mass could go in and that the tourists could view the cathedral at noon. I told him that we were there to attend the mass and he said that it was too full and was only for Czech people. He proceeded to allow a lot of people in as long as they seemed like they were from Czech Republic and unfortunately, I think he did not let us in since we were Asian. I tried to find someone who spoke better English thinking maybe he didn't understand that we were trying to attend mass but he just brushed me off. I was baffled since I've never been discriminated against trying to go to mass when I traveled to other countries in Europe, South America, China, or in the US. Right before mass, the men guarding the door went in and all the tourists were allowed to go in. We went into the cathedral and I started to see if there were any seats free. My husband said that he didn't think we were allowed to sit down and that we may get kicked out...that was the impression they gave us. We ended up attending mass standing in the back. Meanwhile, anyone was allowed to come in to the cathedral while mass was celebrated to take pictures so people were allowed to take pictures pretty much everywhere...in the back, on the sides all the way to the front, and people were walking down the aisles where people were sitting. There were a few times when the men decided people were not allowed to come to certain areas but it was very inconsistent and they seemed more strict with any Asian tourists. The mass itself was beautiful with a wonderful choir singing especially with the acoustics of the cathedral. However, the whole experience made me upset and was truly disappointing."

The admission scheme (and I mean that positively and negatively) is tied up with other monuments on the Prague Castle hill. Tickets which are rather pricey are good for two days, but once you have seen one monument, like the cathedral, you cannot go back again the next day with the same ticket. They make you pay again. I wouldn't have questioned this, but noticing that the tickets covered two days rather than one, it seems miserly not to let you see the church the next day if you wish. When I asked the information and ticket sellers about this \"rule\" which had not been well publicized, they were exceedingly rude."

I recommend paying the additional fee to join the guided tour in your own language. I felt that this gave me an insight that an audio guide would not have, as well as access to parts of the cathedral that were closed to other visitors, such as the crypt. Our guide really helped me to understand better the history and geography of the building, without going into long detail. The Mucha window in the cathedral was fascinating for us, having previously visited the Mucha Museum in the town. The area around the cathedral and the gardens provide continuing interest and pleasure and I would certainly recommend walking to and from the area if you are able, as the views are just amazing. There is a cafe right by the cathedral where you can sit and watch the world go by, as well as a couple of other drink vendors nearby."

We walked around it and because its in a courtyard surrounded by other buildings it looks enormous, where usually Cathedrals are on their own e.g. Palma, Notre Dame, Christ Church.We took a walk inside, the ceiling towers above and looks unsupported. Intricately patterned and stunning.You can walk inside fro free but once inside there is a barrier that you need a ticket to get through to walk all the way up the cathedral. Unless you are really into churches or religion, If you have seen 1 cathedral, you have seen them all.We got there for 10:30 yesterday and it was thronged with coach loads of elderly tourists and American, Italian & French school groups.Well worth a visit though because you cant fail to be impressed by its sheer scale."

My only criticism is that the vast number of crowds visiting the Cathedral took away some of the ambience and tranquillity that you would expect to find in a place of worship. I would suggest that perhaps a visit earlier or later in the day to avoid the crowds would be recommended."

The stained glass is interesting as there are many styles. However, the cathedral can get super busy and crowded by tour groups and their guides. Security is in charge of keeping traffic moving. If you're not part of a tour, it can be awkward to find an out-of-the-way place to listen to your rented headset. Also, in the winter or still-frigid spring, the cathedral was super cold and the marble floor makes your feet really cold."

We went into the cathedral as part of our Prague Castle Long Visit ticket (also allowed us to see the Castle Museum, Castle Powder Tower, etc etc). It is a beautifully decorated and constructed cathedral, that holds mass in Czech every Sunday at 10.30. At other times, it is a place full of tourist snapping photos and trying to see the place.It was quite busy even in the middle of February, I can't imagine what would happen in the summer. As with most church the artefacts and decorations are full of symbols and meanings, but there was little explanation in the church except for a 3-fold brochure. If you are interested in the stories behind the church and decorations, bring a guidebook.It is a very nice building, but I wouldn't call it stunning."

They don't sell them individually. If you really are interested in the whole thing, go for it. Great place and LOTS of walking. And obviously it's at the top of a hill so wear comfortable shoes. On the way down found a great coffee shop. Can't remember the name but it has Ferrari stuff all over. Highly recommend going in there for a snack and drink."

Building less than 25 meters* from the Cathedral. The price of your ticket varies on how much of the \"castle\" you want to see, but for the package we got (~120 Kc), it was well worth it.otherwise, you lose time to see the cathedral, go buy your ticket, and then see it again.but it was great! pretty cool.*I drive in mph, but I walk in meters."

This 14th century wonder has 70 m high ceilings, amazing arches and beautiful towers. The painted glass windows are huge, with many different types of artwork. You will find all of these details and much more in any Prague guidebook. I would like to focus on some practical tips:1. Even though it is listed as a \"free admission\" site on most of the guidebooks, you can only enter the main hall without a ticket. To see the entire cathedral you must have a one.2. Unless you plan to spend a full day in the castle, buy the short visit ticket for 250 CzK rather than the full one for 350 CzK.3. Tickets can be obtained at the entrance to the castle and in many caf\u00e9s. You cannot buy a ticket in the cathedral.4. Climb the 287 steps to the bell tower; the view of Prague is breathtaking."

The stained glass here is some of my favorite anywhere in Europe. You can see plenty of them for free from the entrance. Go in as far as you can, turn around and look above the entrance for a fantastic window. There are more really nice ones deeper inside, which requires a ticket, but the best are at the entrance in my opinion.If you want to see the rest, take the short tour. Even better, get a combo ticket for the short tour and Lobkowicz (way better than the castle) to save some money. You may have to buy the ticket from the Lobkowicz ticket office."

Well, I have NOT seen every church in Europe but I've seen quite a few, and up until recently, the best stained glass windows - in my experience - have been in some church in Beaune, France. Saint Vitus' Cathedral (Prague Castle up on the hill) is beautiful enough to make even aetheists believe. Well...I'm a former-colorist-painter-turned-writer, so I was thrilled. The \"regular\" stained glass in Saint Vitus is similar in style to mosaics and almost like impressionism in swirls. However, there is one window, painted by Mucha in art neuveau style. If you're in Prague...I think this gorgeous church tops the whatever-it's-called clock (if you are an artist or you're a creative type of person looking for inspiration)."

First of all we were told it would be open at 10am. It only opened at 12. By then, the line to get in was going around the corner. Finally, when we managed to get in, there were sooooo many people we couldn't even move without bumping into someone. We just turned around, bumped into quite a few people and walked out. We are going to try and go back tomorrow. The people in charge of organizing these visits should start doing what is already being done in other countries like England and Italy: control the number of people going in. This can be done by tourists and tour agents booking in advance. This is a must see cathedral, though However, here is a word of advice: try to avoid visiting it when everyone and their mother are ..... If you can!"

I would recommend a good guide book or a tour as there is no english translations (but there are english speaking wardens).Overall this was worth the walk up to the castle and we really enjoyed the visit"

The dress code was definitely not as strict as in Italy; I was surprised to see short skirts and camis. Although a bit late, I was able to join the congregation fairly close to the front. The service was all in Czech; my only misstep was when I went to the altar for Communion. The priest said something and hesitated. I glanced up to find him looking at me sternly, and not placing the wafer in my upturned hands. He said, \"AMEN?\" so I repeated, \"Amen.\" The lofty Gothic arches, (the nave is around 100 feet tall) and stained glass windows were punctuated by the shafts of morning sunlight coming through clear glass far up the wall; the pipe organ sounded lovely in the huge space.The service lasted for a little over an hour; during the Postlude, the congregation was able to walk around the church. The chapels and relics were accessible, also the largest censer I have seen.

If you want a proper look you'll definitely need a ticket, bought before you enter the cathedral from an office on the right as you come through the archway into the cathedral courtyard. The ticket allows you a full visit to the cathedral rather than just the back of the nave. Many reviewers have commented about the expense of the audioguide, so I downloaded a guide from PocketVox.com which was very detailed and clear. This can be put on your phone and used with your headphones (or I used a bluetooth headset) so you don't need to hold a handset to your ear the whole time. The stand-out feature of the cathedral for me was the superb stained glass - they are happy for you to take photos and stained glass is easy to photograph. Top tip: zoom in for a better result, in addition to photos of whole windows."

It does show some influences from the Baroque and Renaissance, but latter builders in the 1800s tried to stay true to the original Gothic origins. Of all the sites on the castle hill, this should be one of your \"must sees\"."

It is also a very crowded place with tour group after tour group hearing commentary in a variety of languages. Please do not look as if you are tagging along because you may be told off quite quickly. All the pews were roped off so stopping to say a prayer was not really an easy option. When I asked one of the attendants about it, she did open up the ropes so I could enter a pew and stop and pray. There was so much commotion that I did not stay there long.By the way, there is no need to climb all those steps up. Take the tram No. 22 to stop Pra\u017esk\u00fd hrad and all the walking is down hill."

The initial building design is based on French Gothic designs, drawn by a French master Matthias of Aras.In the interior of the church, I was awed by the magnificent ceilings and columns of the cathedral and its beautiful stained glass windows."

In order to enter the whole cathedral you have to pay a ticket (125 CK for students), this includes also the palace (fail), St George's basilica (bigger fail) and the \"golden walk\" (quite impressive). Only one piece of advice once you have seen St Vito you will be disapointed big-time with the rest of the attractions in the casttle area."

I wish I'd been able to return again: I know I've still missed quite a lot.Rather than attempt what would have to be a lengthy essay on St. Vitus Cathedral, I'll confine myself to praising the stunning painted windows. I know the original architectural concept was for purely plain glass, but the coloured glass ones are a great visual treat. And with strong sunlight on that day, the arabesques cast by them were sublime."

The approaches to St Vitus Cathedral from up the hill downward are spectacular, including two soldiers on guard duty, wearing RayBans. Once through the various walkways it is a surprise when one opens up to reveal the Cathedral. It is as impressive as most cathedrals are, but as we were there on a very sunny day, we were amazed by the colours which suffused through the rose window as were as all the other stained glass. People standing side by side would have one of them appear green, while the other was blue or red! The pulpit was my personal favourite as it was both beautiful and large.Externally the cathedral is a strange eclectic mix of styles, presumably because it took so long to build. Only the upper structure jarred with us as it looked out of place. In addition it is an acquired taste to enjoy people in 20th Century clothes pertrayed in the external statuary. Finally the surroundings of the cathedral are super, as it is set in a large square with lots of room for everyone."

The most outstanding place in the Cathedral is the Chapel of St. Wenceslas which is decorated with frescoes and semi-precious stones. The western part of the Cathedral is charaterized by two tall towers and the rose window. Interior of the Cathderal features with a lot of beautiful and rich decoration and statues and stained glasses"

If you could see only one place in Prague St. Vitus Cathedral is the one.It can be accessed for free but only a small part, enough to take some half decent pictures though but it IS worth paying a small fee. We bought a ticket to Prague Castle - short visit -enabling us to see St. Vitus Cathedral, Old Royal Palace, St. George's Basilica, Golden Lane with Daliborka Tower for CZK 250 which is roughly \u00a38, $12, \u20ac10.The stained glass by Alphonse Mucha took my breath away. This Catholic Cathedral was build throughout the centuries so it's got Renaissance Baroque influences but its architecture is Gothic. There are tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors there.The Cathedral is always crowded to the point it's nearly unbearable to enjoy it. What annoyed us the most was the fact tourists forget this is a religious site, a place to worship & many of them were disrespectful.Best time to visit - in the morning or afternoon. It's open 9.00-18.00 Mon-Sat and 12.00-17.00 on Sun"

Stained glasses in cathedral are beautiful, especially Mucha\u00b4s (something out of the ordinary). Important to know! Without a valid ticket you can enter the cathedral but that\u00b4s just about it. To see more you need to buy a ticket e.g. from the information office opposite the cathedral entrance. The prices seem to be high (CZK 250-350), but please note, that the price includes several attractions. So if you are in need of peace and quiet, avoid St. Vitus. If so, there are many wonderful churches in Prague. I recommend e.g. St. Jacob (or. St. Nicholas at Mala Strana). Opening hours can though be demanding."

You can visit just the back of the church for free, but must get a ticket to see the whole thing (well worth it). The chapels behind the main altar house the bodies of many early Czech kings and there are beautiful stained glass windows. Some are old, some arevrelatively modern - including one by Mucha. I've visited major cathedrals in Paris, London and Rome and have to say that I was blown away by St Vitus. It's uniquely Czech and something you should see when in Prague. My advice would be to visit after lunch as it's truly awful in the AM with hundreds of people from tour groups clogging the place up."

The interior is adorened with Baroque statues of saints, the stained-glass windows. The most impressive statue is the silver tomb monument of the saint John Nepomuk. The statue was the gift of Maria Teresia. There is also very interesting wooden relief in the church. It is a picture of Charles Bridge without the statues, which are there today."

Only the certificat from Cardinal Vlk in April 1997 consecrated the cathedral to St. Wenceslav and St. Adalbert. In 1344, Charles IV commenced the construction of the Gothic cathedral. The first master who headed the building, Matthias of Arras, mediated through his work in Prague a pattern of French cathedral architecture. But it was only Matthias's successor, the genius Peter Parler, who contributed to the Prague Cathedral and its sculptural decoration features of artistic excellence. Overall, the chorus was built with a ring of chapels, St. Wenceslas Chapel, Golden Gate and the lower part of the main tower."

Below, in the crypt, are the royal tombs where many Czech kings and queens and patron saints are interred. It is said that St. Victus' heart is interred in a crypt in the cathedral also. The art work is amazing, along with the architectural features of the cathedral.St. Wenceslas Chapel is decorated with frescoes and semi-precious stones.

Of special interest are the many tombs of clerics and Czech dignitaries scattered throughout the cathedral. Would definitely visit this site again."

As a previous reviewer posted, the ticket price for the Cathedral in somehow expensive, although it includes other attractions, such as the Golden Mile, inside the Castle complex.The ticket is for a self guided walk, without any additional material (guidebook or audio-tour) around the seating of the Cathedral. Any extra will cost you money. Besides this, you can enter the building for free and see the Cathedral from a very generous space inside, before the seating starts, which is also the best place to take pictures. IMO, the ticket isn't worth the price, even considering it includes entry to other buildings. Even the Golden Mile, the 'cutest' of all, is somehow of a tourist trap.It's worth being said, that you you can enter and tour the entire castle complex for free (besides the Gold Mile); the tickets are only required to enter the buildings."

I was able to put everything into contect using my trusty Eyewitness guide book, but the beauty of the building alone was well worth the visit.There is a entry charge, but well worth the fee.

You can get in to the front part of the knave of the cathedral for free but to appreciate the full experience (and see the Mucha stained glass window properly) you need to buy a ticket. It doesn't seem that you can buy a ticket for the cathedral only ( which is what my wife and I wanted). We had to pay 500 CZK for two short-tour tickets which provided admittance to other attractions that we weren't interested in seeing which I think is a bit of a con. (Also you have to pay extra to take any photos although no one seemed to be checking this.)Nonetheless, the cathedral is awe inspiring and the Mucha stained glass quite sublime.Be warned though that in summer it's crowded with endless tours pushing their way through at break-neck speed. The area next to the tomb of Saint John of Nepomuk can get especially crowded. I would guess that it's best to go early or late in the day (or out of season) if you want relative quiet."

At any rate, buy the ticket, view all of the cathedral, and don't complain about having to pay to go into the cathedral. It is gorgeous and worth every penny, and it must cost a heckuva lot to operate the place so it is entirely reasonable to pay for entry. Getting off of my soapbox now...I have visited this cathedral several times and each time, the stained glass moves me to tears. It is so beautiful, much more colorful than I'm used to seeing in cathedrals. Mucha's Art Nouveau window stands out, as does the pink and red window across from it. Those are my favorites, but the other windows are beautiful as well. The cathedral has an impressive organ and I believe that brief organ concerts are held frequently. It's definitely worth looking into before heading to the cathedral, so you can arrive in time to attend if interested. The large pipes allow for amazingly deep, low, powerful notes that seem strong enough to start an eatrhquake. Not to be missed!!!"

You can either simply go in and marvel at all the paintings, mosaiks, statues or take a guide who will explain a lot. On the other hand a good travel book will do the same. Try to find some time to really let your eye wander through the interior and not get bothered by the masses of tourists. Alone for the architecture and the artistry shown inside it is worth nearly one hour of visit. One important tip would be to go up the tower it is really the best sight you have in Prague. P.S.

There is no ticket for the cathedral alone, only combination tickets for entrance to various locations in the Prague castle, so i passed this time.

It is certainly the highlight of our visit to Prague Castle. Because we visited during the off-season in March, the gardens have not yet opened.The cathedral was only opened after Noon. Even so, the cathedral was packed with people. It was hard to move around without blocking someone taking photos. I can only imagine what it must be like during the peak season.I said earlier that St. Vitus is not the grandest cathedral. Notre Dame in Paris is certainly larger. But comparing one to another is pointless. Standing in St. Vitus, you will be blown away by its sheer magnitude. I think cathedrals were meant to be spectacles. Imagine what it must be like to attend mass here, hundreds of years ago, with a full choir and the organ playing. Long before today's rock concerts and Las Vegas shows."

The cathedral should become a place for crowning, a family crypt, a treasury. Cathedral building has begun in 1344 and in 1929, after 600 years of building, the St. Vitus Cathedral has been finished. Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral is fine and with \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438 (simply captivates even from the big distance) and in a nutria (these Gothic arches, stained-glass windows).

The more famous of which are by Alfons Mucha \"the Father of the global art nouveau movement\".The castle complex opens at 05.00 so you can wander around in relative peace and quiet, the cathedral opens at 09.00 and is free to enter.I arrived at around 07.00, and as a keen photographer set up my tripod to take photos of the stunning carvings on the Cathedral side doors. There were very few people around, I was not blocking any access or road and there was ample space. Within a very few minutes a Policeman came and aggressively waved me to move - his point was I could take photos but not use the tripod. Bizarre, as 2 days earlier I had been there at the same time and used my tripod. However heavy rain started and I was forced to abandon - hence the return visit.I picked up my equipment and moved on. As I walked on I was surprised to see the main doors of the Cathedral wide open - by now it was about 07.20.I entered, it was very quiet, and set up my tripod to take the Mucha stained glass windows. Within a matter of minutes a Priest arrived, he spoke perfect English and rudely and aggressively told me to leave and that I could not use the tripod. Apparently the Cathedral was closed BUT why then the doors wide open.The attraction is stunning - colourful, historic and an interesting part of Czech history. However the attitude and inflexibility of these 2 people spoilt it completely. Whilst I respect and totally understand they must do their respective jobs, both approached me, a visitor to their country, with a poor people attitude and no flexibility. Had either said to me \"take 5 minutes to finish and then go please\" I would have understood.Don't let it put you off going, just beware if you are a keen photographer. If the Czech Republic, where the people are generally very welcoming, wants to attract visitors, the attitude of some officials will have to change and they will have to learn some rather better people skills."

It is too bad the windows are all darkened with what I believe is soot, but outside of that, the church is quite a site. If you get a chance to inside you should definitely take it. The history behind the church is also interesting, telling in part why the whole thing is not built in the gothic style."

Be sure to check out the portico on the side of the church with the gold sculptures of the signs of the zodiac on the gate."

One can become jaded (as I have) by seeing too many Gothic cathedrals---this one is not worth standing in line for in my opinion. The stained glass is always beautiful but not close in quality to say the cathedral in Reims, France and many others.Except for the views, the tour of St. Vitus and the Prague \"castle\" were not in my top ten."

All I will add is that I've never seen so many gorgeous stained glass windows in one location. The building is worth the visit for the windows alone. I've attached several photos (including one by 20th century artist Alphonse Mucha), but it is impossible to capture the beauty of the windows with a hand-held camera."

It is located on the Prague Castle grounds and you and both getting to it (by walking through the grounds) and going inside is free. Within, you will find some gorgeous stained glass windows, including one done by the famous Czech Art Nouveau painter Alfons Mucha. This gorgeous window, which stands out noticeably in style from the rest, is worth the visit alone. Beyond that, you will find many attractive chapels, as well as a massive silver tomb dedicated to St. John of Nepomuk. Overall, it's a beautiful cathedral inside and out, and not to be missed."

            "review": "Beautiful Cathedral!!. St. Vitus's Cathedral was the highlight of my trip to Prague and the most beautiful cathedral I've ever been in (surpassing Notre Dame as my previous favorite)! I cannot stress how gorgeous it is inside; the pictures don't come close to doing it justice.Because St. Vitus's is so beautiful, there are a lot of people wanting to visit, and when we were there the line to get in the cathedral snaked all the way along the side and to the back. I can only imagine that it is worse in the summer / peak travel season, but there is one way you can skip the line: rent an audio guide! With your audio guide you get immediate entrance to the cathedral through the exit; this easily saved us over an hour of waiting time (in very cold weather), and it also provides you with an explanation about each relic, stained glass window, and altar you see. Double-check when renting the audio guide that this policy is still in place, but if it is - it is worth the money to save you the time waiting! Plan to spend 45 mintues to an hour in the cathedral - it is huge, with lots of people and lots to see."

And while you do have to wait inline and outside to be let in, this provides that it is not packed like other cathedrals. So you can enjoy yourself and the space without being bumped and shoved. The ability to go up the tower is pretty awesome. There are some great views. However, the climb up leaves something to be desired. 287 spiral stairs with 287 people going up and down at the same time."

            "review": "St. Vitus: An Incredible European Cathedral. Located within the confines of the immense Prague Castle, St. Vitus is the dominant feature of Prague, the spiritual symbol of the Church, and a major, and heavily visited, stop in any trip.I visited St. Vitus during my recent trip to Prague; several things to update since the previous reviews: 1. The cathedral is no longer included in the general admission to Prague Castle having changed \"ownership\" (if this is the appropriate term). While you may look at the exquisite interior from the front for no fee - and stand packed amid a gaggle of fellow tourists - I recommend paying the extra 100 crowns and explore this marvelous building, especially the aforementioned stained glass windows. You can also visit the crypt - if this is your thing.2. I was not required to pay a fee to photograph the interior, which come out very well in an \"Auto\" setting. (Will submit some photos upon preparation.) A must see!"

So if you like them you will enjoy this. It is really the only part of the Hrad complex worth seeing (apart from Golden Lane)!The stained glass is fabulous, for those who like that kind of thing. the enourmous silver monument is also something to behold. the tower is an intersting activity - you cram yourself into a small winding staircase with people going in both directions, its really questionable on health and safety grounds! there are over 300 steps, but is perfectly achievable for someone of average fitness, anyone bothered by tight spaces should not try it though. Don't take loads of bags either - leave them with grandma at the bottom! The views are very good, but not really worth the climb - there are better view points in the city. Its one to say you have done rather than do it because its great!There are few labels or signs for the different aspects of the cathedral and you won't know what you are looking at if you are not on a tour or are without a guide book."

There is enough light inside for flash-less shots and the stained glass windows are stunning, particularly the Mucha.The tower ascent is brutal but also recommended. The view is incredible. A word of warning, however, to those visitors from countries in which (how do I put this delicately?) personal hygiene is a priority: you will be climbing nearly 300 steps in a small space with little ventilation and lots of people...people for whom personal hygiene is not a priority. Go on a hot afternoon and take your chances. It's a tricky climb in some places when crowded. Not advised for people with any physical disabilities whatsoever. I am fit and I was sore the next day."
