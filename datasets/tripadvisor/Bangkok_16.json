Being someone who obsesses over sport and it's development, this park is a model that English authorities need to adopt. There's a flat, mapped out 2.5km running loop, which you can also bike and skate on, free exercise classes and advice, exercise machine, stretching polls and more! It was fantastic to see all shapes and sizes getting active! We ran at night and felt completely safe! Would love to visit in the day to see that city skyline. MD"

It's super clean and well laid out. You can rent a boat and go out on the lake. It can get pretty hot in the middle of the day, though. I'd recommend going no earlier than 3:30 or 4:00 pm to avoid getting super sweaty."

There are huge monitor lizards and you can hire boats. If you like cycling you can whizz right around the park. If you don't like cycling make sure you stay out of the cycle lanes. You can buy water at the edge of the park, I would take some with you. If you like to hunt pokemon this is the place for you, there are groups of pokemon hunters who meet here. You can see the skyscrapers over the park."

There are a lot of runners there in the morning; I suggest getting there before the sun comes up so that the air is a little cooler. I went three times and didn't see any wildlife, but I did enjoy the greenery in the middle of the otherwise very urban city. Also great in the afternoon if you're dying in the heat and need some shade and cool grass to sit on. Lots of Pokestops for Pokemon Go players and very easy to catch pokemon here, particularly Magikarp and the female Nidoran. There's also an outdoor gym which I had a bit of a go on. Only a couple of the machines have weights, most are bodyweight only but there are a LOT of them. Very few people were using them properly - I even saw a guy casually using a leg press on no weight while reading a newspaper... but great for some variety of exercise even if your hotel has a gym. There's even a pool there and some courts but I didn't check them out too closely."

Anyway, they swim in the canals along with catfish, turtles and other fish. You can feed them bread or fish food sold by hawkers (don't worry, you won't have to find them, they'll find you) for about 20 baht. Fun to watch the fish all splash around for this food, mouths agape. That said I feel bad that they're not in the wild.I'm goin' to hell for enjoying watching them, aren't I??!! :(There's a real deal open air gym in one area, and random gym equipment scattered around that area. I would personally feel too self-conscious to work out in public like this, but some people might enjoy that.

There was also a creepy \"massage man\" who came up and tried to \"rub\" my shoulders and grabbed my wrist. The man who was \"growling\" like a bear topped off the experience. Made us uncomfortable to say the least. Get rid of the crazy people and the park has lots of potential."

A large statue of Rama VI on horseback stands at the main entrance to the park. It is full of trees, shrubs and a large lake, and is home to a surprisingly large number of birds.The park is very popular with locals and tourists alike for a morning or evening stroll, or for the more strenuously-minded, a jog around the lake or some exercise in the special exercise areas.Do not be surprised if you are stopped by Thais who want to practice their English on you. If you have the time, spend five or ten minutes talking to them, helping them with their language training and getting some insights into Thai culture for yourself."

I play basketball here, but you can lift weights, play volleyball, swim (for the latter two, you must join the sports club...maybe 40-50 baht/year along with a doctor's certification of health). A hidden treasure (in my opinion) is the existence of monitor lizards that patrol the canals. Some of these lizards are 4 - 5 feet long. If nothing else, Lumpini Park has an ample number of benches, tables, or simply grass to relax on and enjoy a pleasant Bangkok afternoon."

It is fascinating to watch the simple and easy interaction of Thais as they start their day in such an uncomplicated and charming way. Early mornings and evenings are the best times as you will avoid the heat of the day.

Lumpini Park is a huge park and we had no idea where this exhibit is located. We continued walking to the end of the park only to find nothing. Asking random people there is such a challenge due to the language barrier. I managed to ask one woman and she tried her best to get her message across by saying, \"Elephant... go home.\" THAT IS SUCH A BUMMER! I could swear we saw that it was until Jan 29th, but when I checked the website again afterwards, it says Jan 27th. Sob. Sob. We went there for nothing. It was a very tiring experience due to all that walking we did, but it was pretty nice to rest against a tree and just have some quiet time. I truly appreciated that. :)"

There are free aerobics classes conducted by volunteers which anyone can participate. There is also a public open air gym for people who wanna flex some muscles.In the park, there are a few ponds where u can rent a paddle boat. Be careful of roaming monitor lizards, they swim well.

To our delight they have pedal boats, and row boats that you can go on the lake with 20 baht for 30 mins, with a 20 baht deposit that you lose if you are late back, or as in out case lose your ticket, (that's not on the signs). I. The lake there are fish to feed, turtles and monitor lizards, there are also pigeons at the edge of the lake that you can feed.at 5pm the Zumba/aerobics starts throughout the park in several places. Anyone can jump on in and give it a go. Whilst pedalling in the boat and also walking lakeside we saw big lizards, incredible to see in their natural habitat. They also have a nice playground for the children to play in."

On almost every trip to Bangkok i find time to visit Lumpini Park; it has a very attractive lake with lovely pathways through a wide range of plants, shrubs and trees. Whilst there are plenty of activities going on [cycling, exercise, Tai Chi, aerobics] it is still peaceful. There is a concert hall, various exhibition centres and lovely views across the trees of the Bangkok skyline. The crowning glory of its quirkiness is the quaint bell tower that always strikes the hour at 7 minutes past!!"

We only had one night in Bangkok as part of a layover, so certainly aren't experts, however walked out to this park and some of the local areas to get as much of a feel for the place as we could in our short time. This park was a real mixture. Lots of activity, runners and families after work. Also huge amounts of wildlife, massive monitor lizards (up to 6ft long) and terrapins dot the side of the lakes which is amazing. It was sad to see so much rubbish around but we may have gone on a bad day. Worth a wander in even if it's just for thewildlife. If your looking for the Monitor Lizards head to the path between the lake on the left of the park, as that's where they seemed to all be."

For a mega city the size of Bangkok, with it's high rises and skyscrapers and tight real estate, this park is very open and HUGE! It's so peaceful, and so green and full of life - be it chirping birds, or blooming palms ad bushes, or lazy tanning iguanas, Whenever visiting Bangkok, I always try to choose a hotel within a 20 minute walk to Lumpini Park. Last fall, around Thanksgiving time, there was a water festival (Loi Krathong) and the park lake was full of flower wreaths that people put in the water to pray away life's worries and problems. But the park is amazing year round. People go there to do yoga, to go for a morning run, there is even an old school outdoor free weights gym, you can rent a paddle boat shaped like a swan to paddle the lake, and so much more. Highly recommended."

It was hot and humid out but there are lots of trees so there was some shade. The paths wind through the park and around the ponds so the view is quite pleasant. We had gone to the park hoping to see a variety of birds. We did see birds including egrets nesting in one tree but there were no waterbirds to be seen. We soon discovered the reason, there are water monitor lizards in the park and if you watch for a few minutes you'll see one swimming in the water. One that we saw must have been two metres long. We saw a smaller one eating a fish on the shore and there are lots of fish in the ponds.Lots of people are just walking but many were running and there is an indoor gym in the park although I don't know how you obtain access. There was also an outdoor workout area full of obviously homemade equipment and it seemed to be well used. A bike lane was marked on some of the paths but signs indicated that use was restricted to selected hours.Overall, the park is a nice place for a quiet stroll and worth the effort to get there. Note; the train station is across a busy road but if you go down into the subway station you can easily cross underground into the park."

It's a peaceful green haven surrounded by skyscrapers and traffic clogged streets. Bangkok residents flock there for early morning exercise and Sunday afternoon picnics but it never seems to feel crowded. There are plenty of free toilets and picnic tables, a chance to buy refreshments at one of the entrances and two lovely lakes providing pedalos and rowing boats. Best of all just chill out under a shady tree and watch a Tai Chi class."

You can also bike as well, even on a hot midday sun it would be a great relaxing retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city.Plus you get a great views of the city as well!We literally walked our way to Jim Thompson House, so I guess its walkable from there? lol"

It's a nice park but at the end of the day, it's a park and if you walk around the edge it's 2.6km but in the heat of Bangkok it's intense and will have you sweating in seconds. There is a lake with peddle boats but the boats are really dated and the lake looks filthy! There are monitor lizards around but I couldn't help but notice there are also a lot of homeless people around in the shaded areas, under trees, next to bushes and on benches. Do not visit when the sun is at its most intense which we did between 12-2, it's a killer! Make sure you have water with you if you do head this way. There is some stalls just before you enter and 1 official stall just inside the gate but no further stalls inside so if you don't have any water make sure you buy some. "

In my opinion it is the best place to relax or exercise in the centre of this metropolis. Excellent city park. Every time I visit Bangkok I go to Lumpini Park almost on a daily basis in the evenings. Although right in the centre, you can easily detach yourself from the crowded rush and industrial noise whilst relaxing by the ponds, exercising with dozens of other people (across all ages) to the rhythm of music, or simply go for an evening jog (which I particularly love). Compare it to other city parks, such as Hyde Park in London or Central Park in NYC, and this one (due to the overall climate and atmosphere) would be my favourite."

Lumpini is Bangkok's equivalent of Central Park in New York, Hyde Park in London, Luneta Park in Manila, the People's Park in Beijing etc etc. Watch out for the National Anthem at 8.00am and make sure you stand up and observe it; then it's all over and people disperse back to their regular days."

Lumpini Park is a lovely place to visit but as with many urban spaces there needs to be a measure of caution taken by foreign and domestic visitors alike. Females do not need to visit the park alone and definitely do not need to travel into secluded areas of the park without a confident male escort (stay on the path and well in-sight of others). Leave the park before sundown. There are usually street vendors at the entrance to the park so don't bother bringing a picnic unless you just want to. There are little boats which you can paddle around the lake for a small fee and sitting mats which can be rented from a kind lady on a bicycle. When you are ready to leave just leave the mat near the path and the lady will pick it up. If you see a mat by the path, then you can start using it but you will have to pay the rent fee when the lady comes by (no transfers). The statue of the Thai King \"Rama Five\" is at the entry to the park. If you search the statue base facing the \"Skytrain\" you will find marks from bullet strikes which happened during the Red Shirt Protest and Military Crackdown in 2010. Decide for yourself if rubber bullets made these marks. Many Thai Citizens died in the defense of democracy around this statue in 2010. Please be respectful."

People were napping from homeless to business people but the monitor lizards were out en masse.I am told there is exercise to be had at 6 am or 7 am and you can join in but this was our leisure day so we got up late and sat and listened to music and read in the park instead.Check out the very old gym equipment that is there for people to use. At night, on the corner of the park there is a dinner square of various \"restaurants\" more like food carts. You can eat and have a beer with the locals if you can find a seat. Very tasty food."

I like to go for morning jogs when I am traveling on business, usually around sunrise (which was about 6:30am during the time of my visit). I got to the park around 6:40am and it was already pretty busy. The park is a favorite of all ages and backgrounds. There are numerous areas where locals practice Tai-Chi and yoga, exercise on the aerobic activity areas, and of course walk and jog. There are a few restrooms and water fountains around the park as well as some vending areas for food and drink, so it's well supported for jogging.The park is surrounded on all sides by fairly busy streets, but large enough such that traffic noises disappear in the central areas of the park.The landscaping and the \"feel\" of the park are beautiful and relaxing, and these jogs were definitely some of the best experiences during my trip."

We went to Lumpini Park every morning of our stay, its a fantastic Green oasis in the middle of Bangkok and a welcome place to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and breath some fresher air. We were lucky as our hotel (Banyan Tree) was only a short stroll away from the park which made it quite easy for us to get to but I would not hesitate to travel some distance to it as it was well worth it.As others have said the Monitors and Turtles are a great thing to see but there are also some nice birds, including birds of prey to be seen. It was great to feed the Koi and Cat Fish which are plentiful and come straight to the top for the bread once you throw it in the water.It was nice to sit off and watch the world go by and its not long before you are engaged in conversation with the locals who were very proud of their park and their city.Lots of little snack kiosks around so getting a welcome cold drink or something light to eat was not a problem.If you are into keeping fit, there are plenty of free outdoor gym equipment you can use and an outdoor gym which again proved very popular with local people.The staff work very hard to keep the park well maintained with some really nice floral displays, especially around by the Kings statue.The park is also a botanical gardens so most of the trees and shrubs are labelled so you can see what species they are if you are into that kind of thing (we are).I would certainly say add this to your itinerary if you are planning a Bangkok trip, we thought it was probably one of the highlights of our visit and the best thing, its completely free."

We had just finished a late night flight to Bangkok and had some hours to go before our trip to Pattaya was scheduled and we had no energy to go explore the city as a whole. Lumpini Park seemed the right place to relax. So we caught the Airprot link metro to Makkasan and from there, caught the MRT to Silom station, which led us right to the entrance of Lumpini park. There is an information desk from where we collected our Park map. Its a clean neat green park with no-nonsense people jogging,cycling, walking, boating or just sight-seeing, each one at their own world. The park didn't seem to be much of a touristy spot and hence was ideal to get a glimpse of Bangkok's daily life. You can choose to go boating or just stroll around munching the snacks you get around or just lie down and go for a sleep with no concern, just like I did. It's a lovely place to be in Bangkok and if lucky, you can spot one or two komodo dragons as well."

As you get into the park there are some trees which help provide some cooling from the rather intense sun. Both ponds provide paddle boats that are reasonably priced. The better albeit smaller pond is the one on the right if you are paddle boating because it has more shade and you'll be able to see more of the rather large fish, turtles, egrets and lizards. A fun thing to do is to stop at one of 7/11's that are everywhere and get some bread to feed the fish as you're boating."

Many long-term expatriate residents of Bangkok say they couldn't survive without their regular visits to the serene quiet of Lumpini Park. The land for this beautiful oasis was donated by King Rama VI in 1925 and he graciously helped finance it's development. Prior to this it was used for hunting by the aristocracy and is the oldest park in the city. Rama VI's statue adorns the plaza in front of the main entrance to the park.The park is busiest early in the morning cool with walkers, joggers, tai chi exponents, and aerobic dancers. It opens at 0430 and there is always a crowd awaiting access! Between 10am and 3pm cyclists are allowed in the park and they have their own dedicated bike lane - stay clear as they take it seriously! The main jogging/cycling pathway is a convenient 2.5 kilometers for one lap and is marked every 100 meters - great for interval training and timing your runs.Besides the lakes, ancient trees and wonderful flower beds is the wildlife. Water monitor lizards are a big attraction for tourists. Some grow as long as 6 feet and if you are lucky may come across one feeding on dead fish or even one of their own young - yes they are cannibalistic. Besides lizards there are turtles, many species of birds, and the odd squirrel may be sighted in the trees or hopping along overhead cables. Buy some fish food from a local vender and feed the fish - quite a frenzied sight. Boats are for hire and two open air gyms usually allow foreign visitors to exercise free. Dogs are not allowed and smoking is prohibited.The park also becomes busy again in the early evening when office workers conduct their exercise and participate in aerobic dance. You can join in for free!There are plenty of toilet facilities around the park and two refreshment stalls to sit and enjoy a coffee or cool drink whilst watching people enjoy this lovely environment.Easily accessible from the Sala Daeng BTS station and the Silom underground MRT station. Entrance is free and open 0430 to 2030 daily."

The latter is spectacle I haven't seen anywhere else and in the years I have been visiting Bangkok, it has grown if anything, despite hot, humid condiditions that would make most fitness freaks wilt in about five minutes.

For a walk or jogging, some cycling, enjoying the free fitness equipment at your disposal or just lay down in the gras and enjoy nature, this park offers it all. Being surrounded by many busy roads it is amazing how silent it is. A real gem in the concrete jungle."

Bring something to eat and sit on a bench by the water. Every morning you'll see different groups of people doing Tai Chi. My visits are mostly during the late afternoon where it feels like any one who is a runner is running on the pathway that circles the park. Where else are you going to run in the city?At about 5:30-6pm, I've seen an aerobic class near the main entrance. The music is blasting and at least 50-100 people are moving to the music which is being led my an instructor. I'm almost certain this is a free class. I've also seen two work-out areas. One is an outside free-weight section. The equipment looks old but people seem to use it. The other is recreational equipment that mimics machines one would use at the gym. These machines use a persons natural body weight to help you work out. Escape the chaos of the city streets and enjoy the calm of this park."

I recently visited Lumpini Park which, as many reviews describe, is a wonderful little green paradise in the middle of the hugely congested and over-populated city of Bangkok.The park is beautiful, with plenty of greenery which is maintained to a high standard. It has a few small lakes where you can take a little boat out and relax on the water. You will almost definitely see some monitor lizards, which I thought was amazing! These large reptiles may look scary for the first time but they are very timid and just wander the park and go for a swim!There is a wonderful monument of King Rama VI in the South-West corner of the park.The only let down is the 'food court'. This is pretty much all closed down and dilapidated. It could be a thriving mini food market but all that's left is a few small fruit stands. If you wanted to go for a nice walk in the park and have a bite to eat then pack your own food as you will need to go for a long walk to find somewhere to grab a bite near the park.(P.S. I visited the park at noon on a Saturday afternoon; a time I thought would be perfect to grab some food)"

Probably best not to visit in the middle of the day though as it's really hot. As the sun sets, the park is transformed into a truly stunning spectacle, reds, pinks and purples reflect off the sky scrapers in the distance. In our opinion, at sunset, it's truly one of the best places to take photos in Bangkok. Worth noting, just before sunset, every Thai person (without exception) who was in the park turned to face one of the sky scrapers and stood in silence whilst (i believe) the national anthem was played on loud speakers. It was a strange, but intriguing experience."

Lots to keep them occupied at the park and much older kids having fun too. Plenty of exercise machines for adults and a cycle lane for those with bikes. You can rent pedal boats - we didn't so not sure of the price. Drinks available at the gates to the park. Didn't see anyone selling inside. Shady play area over by the Rama IV/ wireless road side. There's a bigger play area in the centre of the park but pretty out in the sunshine most of the time. We walked around and saw Komodo dragons lazing around. Great for our son who loves all kinds of creatures. "

Would recommend for a couple of hours to escape the hustle and bustle of the city - very close to Siam square which is handy."

Everyday activities/resources include: running paths, bicycles (can be rented just outside the park), small boats (including cute DUCK paddle boats!), playgrounds, basketball courts, and many relaxing sitting areas/benches/gazabos for resting, relaxing and reading. We totally enjoyed just wandering about and enjoying this little bit of nature in the middle of the modern city. The park is also a venue for other city events like:- Sunday nights (5:30-7:30PM) in January the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra hosts a free concert (AWESOME!)- The \"elephant parade:\" decorated elephants that will be actioned off for charity.At different times there are food vendors by the main gate (south east corner) selling fruit, BBQ, and drinks. We snagged dinner one night at the night market (very small) just outside the west side of the park (yummy grilled fish). There is also a convenient metro stop in the south-west corner. Limited parking available around the outskirts of the park."

In the late afternoon you have several group activities spread over the Park and you see the Fan or Sword dancers, Tai Chi devotees , Aerobics Enthusiasts . In mid January '16, Thailand launched their Tourism Festival over a 5 day period. The Park was hosting this Event. There was a Big Stage in the middle of the Park that had many different dances and musical performances showing the rich culture of Thailand. There were different Light Installations, Gift Bazaars and Food Stalls. It must have attracted several thousands of people during this time.The Park is a Leisure Centre of Outdoor activities.

There is a government bus that goes from Mo chit 2 bus station (bangkok) to siem reap and costs 750 baht. This is the simplest option to cross the border but there are just 2 buses everyday (8 and 9 am) and they get fully booked quickly during high season. Second best option is this casino bus.Go to the entrance of Lumpini park in rama IV road. Next to it, there are colorful double decker buses that leave during the morning for the cambodian border city called Poipet. (The bus will be parked across a big HSBC)I had trouble finding the exact times these buses leave bangkok, but I know the first leaves at 5 am and they are more reliable during the morning (since the goal is to take thai gamblers to the casinos soon).Once we got to the park a guy already asked if we were going on the bus. We said \"border, poipet\" and he said \"yes, ok\".That's the thing: they are made for casino players but anyone can use them, no problem.So you hop on the bus (air conditioned, they offer you water and some soy milk) and just chill.They stop twice for snacks and toilet during the trip. The guy that monitors the bus asked for everyones passports to make a list for the casino, but said we didn't need to give ours (cause we clearly we not going to gamble).We were the only foreigners on the bus, cuz this is a route not too many people talk about.The trip costed us 300 baht, and the bus is quite comfortable. It used to be 200, but the price has changed (locals paid the same value, we paid attention to that).We left at 7 am and got to the border at 11:30 am. Since we left before all the vans, we got both the thai and cambodian immigration offices empty and managed to do the whole visa and crossing process in less than one hour.Piece of advice: read other websites to get informed about all the touts and scams you have to dodge while crossing. Just be attentive, walk like you know what you are doing and know your stuff, and it will be a piece of cake. :)"

If you walk along the water edge you'll probably spot a monitor lizard in the trees or even the water.

What we didn't expect to find was a really nice well kept peaceful park with wildlife.To get here by BTS Skytrain the nearest station is SalaDaeng which is only a few minutes away. Nearest underground station is Lumphini.We didn't know what to expect , having never been to a park in Thailand before, but we were pleasantly surprised.The park was well kept with no sign of any weirdos often found in parks back in the UK.At first we thought we saw a Crocodile (nature isn't our strong point) see pic. It turns it that it was a monitor Lizard (we think). We saw many of these on our walk around the park and they didn't seem interested in us, although we still gave them a wide berth. There was lots of birds and other wildlife to look at.The boats looked good but we didn't go on them. It was 2 pm and too hot. I later read on the internet that this park is popular with Thai people early morning and early evening and this is obviously why. Next visit to Bangkok I will be joining them.There is a small shop that sells water etc. and we did find the Geocaches that we were searching for."

Trees, orchids, fountains and swan or rowboats. Second, if you are a tourist who is interested in the lives of Thai people. This is where many go: couples on blankets, families with children at the playground, bicyclists. And there is a public library and an Elderly Center. A couple of tips: do take water and food as its NOT commercial space; there are public restrooms with a 5 baht charge for paper. Also look for the large water lizards in the ponds."

Many flat paths make for easy walking, be on the lookout for the many, and large monitor lizards, they didn't bother us, tending to walk away from us rather than coming towards us. The park is used by many joggers and cyclists, so you need to be aware when walking as some come up quite fast. Paddle boats can be hired for 40 baht for 30 minutes, but you are asked to stay in one area of the lake which effectively stops you from seeing more of the park from the lake. Whether your there to keep fit or just sit in the shade of one of the many trees, this is a nice park to visit."

It is a plot of land in the center of the city, a few blocks worth, nice for a walk, but not very 'park-y', in that it has too many paths, vendors, buildings and the like for this limited area. It is NOT a Central or Hyde Park, by any means. And I suspect the Thais will eventually sell it off, bit by bit, to make malls and condos. But for now, it is the best we got, for getting a bit of nature."

I paid 50-100 baht for all day of use on a pretty standard bike. The park itself was a golf course that was transitioned into a park so the paths to walk and bike are really nice and paved.

It can be accessed via the BTS and MRT, has multiple bathroom facilities (5B), and a few small food vendors at the entrance. The park has a series of murky water lakes holding plenty of fish that like to be fed by the tourists and locals alike, along with the Monitor Lizards that look like small crocodiles skimming along the surface of the waters. The numerous, wide, concrete pathways (very wheelchair accessible) throughout the whole park lead past an interesting Thai clock tower, some other architecturally interesting buildings, an area with old but usable outdoor gym equipment, two playground areas, and numerous enclaves for people to sit and play games in the shade. Even on a Saturday afternoon, I found the park pleasantly uncrowded, with plenty of room for roaming or finding a quiet place by the water. Of course, in the day time, it seemed like a safe place to wander or loaf and a great place to take a date or family for an afternoon stroll or picnic.One can easily spend a couple of hours walking around the park or enjoy using the excellent designated bike path. Unfortunately, the rental bikes available at the entrance points are junk; so, you decide what suits your mood. The rental paddle boats are amusing to watch, but they too are the traditional slow tourist clunkers. Don't expect any nice kayaks to paddle around - which would be appropriate and nice recreation for the area. Overall, I enjoy the park and like to visit it each time I come to Bangkok. But, it rates only average in my book due to its somewhat run down, over developed environment. For a city park, its a pleasant natural area, but its not gorgeous, nor is it a particularly photogenic place. It's a worthwhile visit though and would be a good daily workout place if one lived close by."

You wouldn't know you were in a big city when you go into Lumpini Park, it's like being in the countryside!We wandered through and sat down by the water for a bit which was extremely relaxing. The park is beautifully maintained. We were slightly confused by the \"no eating and drinking\" rule since there seemed to be tables in the park but maybe I was misunderstanding something.A Thai gentleman pointed out to us that there were some animals, \"like crocodiles but not crocodiles\" round the corner which my husband knew to be monitor lizards. They really did look like crocodiles to me, but were not at all bothered by us taking photos of them."

The park in the midst of the City of Bangkok is a large green land of a boating lake complete with peddle boats in the shape of swans and real live very large lizards. The populace seem to enjoy the many activities together with a few tourists who have discovered this oasis with many areas dedicated to open air Tai Chi exercise classes sponsored by the Government and delivered free of charge by professional paid instructors. There are several outdoor gyms with good weight lifting equipment and assault courses. The park also caters for the not so energetic with acres of grass and flower beds."

There's restaurants inside the park where you can get some water or other snacks (or even have breakfast). There's easy access to the park by cab or by BTS sky train.

There is interesting wildlife in Lumpini. The park has many large (up to three meters) water monitor lizards that can always be seen swimming, walking on the banks of the ponds or \"sunbathing.\" It must also be emphasized that these lizards pose no threat to anybody. If you leave them alone they will leave you alone. In Lumpini you can also see squirrels, fish and many species of birds. The park also has at least one outdoor \"gym\" where you can work out for just a little over a dollar. You can also rent paddle boats and take them out on the pond. The best time to go is in the morning when it is cool and there are fewer people."

We went to the park at around 4 and stayed til about 5/5.30. Before we left we heard some very loud music playing and noticed quite literally hundreds of people exercising around us, whilst all watching some people at the front leading them.

Cute outing, and couples well with the nearby snake farm."

There are plenty of walking/ jogging paths inside as well as a small lake where you can rent paddle boats. On Thursday mornings there is an outdoor market. Most days there are many small vendors around the outside of the park who serve a quick breakfast or lunch. If you're new to the area, you can buy a good Thai-style meal for just a couple of dollars- 50-60 Baht. There are several neighborhoods close by where you can find sit-down restaurants, if you prefer."

Aside from the different wildlife (you can spot Komodo Dragons around the water), locals use the park for walking, resting, and even lifting weights. A great place to get a run in - believe me, much safer than the streets - as cars are not allowed in. Small shrines can be found and the Southwest entrance boasts a huge shrine to King Rama VI. Also a great place to catch some shade on a hot Bangkok day."

A significantly spacious area with lakes, fountains in the middle of the lakes, and some canals filled with water apart from the lakes, this park is truly an \"urban oasis\" in the middle of a bustling area of the city (right beside Rama IV Road). The presence of a fairly grand clock tower just inside the entrance from Rama IV near Lumphini MRT Station and a tall statue of Rama VI on the other end of the park along the same road speak to the fact that this is no ordinary park, and indeed it has some history of being the first public park of Bangkok decreed by the king (Rama VI) himself.Be sure not to miss some things that can easily be overlooked in the park such as the turtle egg shells (stones really) with horoscopic signs near the Clock Tower, the little square-shaped pavilion on a grass area, the Buddha shrine at some inside area of the park, and yes you might even catch a glimpse of a big lizard crossing your path or beside it!The park is just a few minutes' walk from Lumphini MRT (just cross Rama IV after exiting the station and then just on your left is the park entrance), and actually Silom MRT is also right across the park further down on Rama IV, but I'm not sure if there's a proper entrance to the park near that station, so I would suggest taking the MRT to Lumphini.There are small food vendors in the park, but I guess you could also bring food from outside for picnicking and such, and there are swan boats for pleasure peddling in the lakes available."

Green yes and did offer some escape from the city. Probably better to visit at a different time if you want to relax away from the noise. The park can be a dangerous place at night. (Like any city)."

I often go jogging here in the evening, when the park becomes vibrant (and much cooler). For those looking for a bit of exercises there are up to three open-air aerobics where you can join and leave as you feel like (around 5-6 p.m.) -- it is fun and free of charge. No needs to wear aerobic clothing. Otherwise you can go for a run on the jogging route, play with the resident cats along the way, and if you are lucky enough, spot the monitor lizards. Alternatively, you can also sit back and relax by the ponds. My favourite activity is feeding the hungry fishes and the turtles. You can buy the fish food and bread from sellers at 10THB per pack. Watching the fish gobble up all the bread is a fun and rewarding experience."

However, it is now well over a year since it was cleared of protesters whose presence caused much damage and destruction.Sadly, whoever has responsibility for taking care of the park has made very little effort to properly restore broken and damaged areas, (albeit not solely as a result of the aforementioned encampment, but some an accumulation of years of neglect). The variety of rubbish bins in various states of disrepair are themselves an eyesore. These are in addition to the decaying bridges, pathways and signage. Is it not possible to have an effective plan to restore this wonderful space to something truly special in Bangkok - primarily for its residents?New lavatories were built a few years ago, but now these have been made into semi residential areas for the attendants and their hangers on, and the insides, with decrepit facilities and wet floors, are as horrible as anyone could fear. Outside all manner of rubbish defeats any beauty that was fleetingly visible before they were colonised as hangouts for the attendants. And what's the point of the park security? Does anyone ever supervise them or any of the employees at the park?Please can this park be restored to its full potential of a place of beauty?"

As far as a park is concerned there are several in Bangkok(and in other parts of Thailand) that are easily better than this.First and foremost this park is often used for political demonstrations. It has the highest number of homeless of any park in Bangkok. People get mugged and there have been murders here. I also find that it isn't really manicured as well as other parks in the city. If you live around here I'm not saying don't go. What I am saying is if you are looking for great parks try Rama IX Park, Chaktujak Park, or Queens Park at Phrom Phong. These parks are part of the Thai Royal Organization and they are much better looked after and free of some of the sleazy stuff I wrote about above."

It's not bad, definitely tropical, spacious, lots of open space and water, but aside from all that nothing so special. Suan Luang / Rama 9 park is better, more interesting designed natural areas, better plant development, shadier, but then that park is way out of city center, probably not worth a trip for a tourist. Rot Fai park--not far from Chatuchak Park and the Mo Chit BTS station--is about as good, also more out of the way. For me the Dusit Zoo is as good as a park, and much better for kids, because it has a lot more mature plant growth, plenty of space, a zoo, and options like a tram, lots of food alternatives, a seal show, etc. It's nice that it's right in the city but then you get some road noise on the edges too. Those monitor lizards are all over the place in Bangkok, and they are cool."

I love parks and living so close to Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, I'd say it's a little tough to find something so dramatically beautiful, even if man-made, elsewhere in Asia. Having said that, I must admit I wasn't completely taken with Lumpini Park. Although I think it does a good job of providing a lovely patch of greenery to residents and visitors in Bangkok, for when pollution and crowd fatigue syndrome gets a little too overwhelming. The park itself is quite big and nice enough for a stroll, jog, or leisure cycling. We particularly like the lake in the middle of the park and you can rent a small boat/duck boat for 40 Bht for a 30-minute spin around the lake. It's very relaxing to just be floating away in the water, especially on a hot day/afternoon. Look out for the big lizards lazing on the banks or swimming across the water. I was a bit scared because some of them look like baby crocodiles! There are drinks/snack stalls just outside the park so make sure you buy a bottle of water - or two - if you intend to stay in the park for more than an hour. The park can get pretty crowded in the late afternoon towards early evening so picking out a spot to just sit and ruminate might be challenging. In this case, you're better off taking a stroll or a slow jog - both good exercises for the heart."

Sometimes its nice to slow down and let the world recharge your batteries. Lumpini is a Royal Park and you do feel very special as it surrounds you. The noise of bustling Bangkok disappears as you stroll through the spectacular vegetation. Take a boat out on the lake and be at one with yourself .....Bangkok is not just all Bars and brashness. Take time out for yourself and enjoy a relaxing few hours in peace and tranquillity."

There are few green and open places in Bangkok so it can be a joy to get away from the noise, crowds and pollution. The park also puts on concerts in certain seasons which can be culturally interesting - bring a picnic, something to sit on and plenty of insect repellant, and you can enjoy a local open air concert of music dancing or both. However, a typical european park this is not. The grass can be scorched - or non-existent - and there will always be biting insects. The facilities are poor and frankly, it's not a beautiful, well planted or relaxing space. It is though a relatively green and open space away from Bangkok's crowded streets - and if taken as brief respite, or for an open air concert, it can be enjoyed. Not a place to go out of your way to visit, but if you are in the area, it's an alternative to the busy streets."

The park has a really nice set up, with grass and trees throughout the park. There are some stands that sell well priced drinks, snacks, and ice cream. As of now the only drawback I can think of is that it does not really allow pets (at least not when I was a child many years ago). I had a small toy poodle-cup mix that was super friendly but they would only alow us in if we carried her.

Water dragons roaming the park are about as shocking as anything. People exercising, musical concerts of a wide variety, gatherings, dance classes, exercise classes surrounded by beautiful flowers, trees, bushes, monuments, trails. It's lovely.I now live by Lumpini Park and exercise there 5 days a week so I thoroughly LOVE Lumpini Park."

It is a very peaceful and serene park, perfect for an afternoon stroll or jog. There is a track around the park for those who want to job. There's also water bicycling. We saw people doing tai chi and aerobics lessons as well. The only unpleasant part of this park is that we saw some monitor lizards crawling in the park."

Its spread oevr a large area and is very calm and peaceful park. It feels like resting in the lap of nature. You can be here from early morning to late evening and at any time of the day you may find it full of people either excercising, running, meditating, playing etc. and making the enviornment more cheerfull. They have few ponds in mid of the park which add to the beauty of the park. There is a open stage at the centre most of park where youcan relish soulfoul music or various kinds of performances as per their scehdules. I personally enjoyed live singing by a few people and their band in the evening. You can reach there by MRT station Si lom, although there is one more station call Lumphini. Its advisable not to get down at Lumphini station for Lumphini park as you may have to walk a lot from there to reach the park. So best way is to get down at Si lom station and as you exit right infront of you is entry to Lumphini park. Its a must visit place if you feel to renew your senses and replinish yourself."

There is a road inside the perimetre where cyclists, roller skaters, joggers etc all keep fit and area for those who like to exercise in public. There are plenty of benches and shelters from the sun for the less energetic and you sit quietly, near the canal or the lake you will almost certainly see squirrels,lizards, terrapins, herons and thousands of fish (which you can buy food to feed them with).Lovely relaxing place, away from all that scorching concrete!"

Visit early in the morning (5-6 AM) and you will see an amazing number of locals doing Various forms of exercise. During the day there are many attractions (a lake with boat rental), various food and merchandise stands around the perimeter, and you are likely to encounter various political activities and other curiosities. The calm and gardens in the middle of this busy megatropolis is rewarding.If you go be sure to go across Rama IV Road and up a short distance to visit Wat Hua Lumphong. Since I am married into a Thai family I visit countless Wats, and this is my favorite of all. It is a Wat \"for the people\" dedicated to the King. There is a wonderful shed full of Kwai (water buffalo) that are rescued from slaughter. Put 20 baht into the box by the shed, open the chest and take a bundle of greens to feed the Kwai. They will appreciate it and you will get in touch with these wonderful animals. Then go past the main Temple to the right and you will see an administrative looking structure. Walk in there and you will see a table with 3-4 ladies selling certificates. For 500 baht or so (donor determines the amount) you will get a pink slip with your name on it and a receipt (all written in Thai). Take the pink slip to the large adjoining room and you will see a vast stack of inexpensive coffins. Paste jars are sitting around so that you can paste your pink slip to a coffin of your choice. These coffins will be used in cremation services for the poor (with your slip attached). Now follow the crowd to another room where a fire pit awaits your receipt. Monks will be chanting and hammering a large gong.I find this whole experience a good way to share something of great importance to the Thai people. You will not see many Farang (foreigners) here but be bold - observe that actions of others and show respect. It is one or two hours well spent and unique in Thailand as to size and scale. There are lots of taxis around Lumpini Park so is you are not familiar with MTR (one subway stop from Lumpini to Sam Yan Station) take a taxi so you don't get lost.These are \"Thai attractions and really not tourist attractions\". Get in touch with the Thai people and check this out."

I found this park very enjoyable after spending many days traveling around metropolitan Bangkok visiting the temples and the shopping. It is very well maintained and large. I was told by a friend that there are komodo dragons here (and have seen pictures) but they must have been sleeping under some rocks.There are a few things to do here: rent a pedal boat, some playground equipment. But I would say it is mostly a nice place for a run (in 30C weather!) or a nice walk as a change of pace.Because it is not a normal \"tourist attraction\" for the most part, it appeared to be mostly locals making use of the park - lunching, walking, playing. There were enough interesting architectural features that I took a good number of pictures, but I am a bit obsessive about taking pictures. I'm not attaching them because they wouldn't really give you any sense of the actual park, just architectural details.So, if you need a break just to relax in the open air, I very much recommend it. If you are on vacation with limited time, you probably won't spend too many hours here, unless you've got a squirmy kid that needs to run around like crazy for a while. Either way, enjoyable."

Anyone who's had enough of sightseeing and shopping could do a lot worse than spend some time here, away from the perpetual traffic jams of central Bangkok. The gardens are well tended with lots of interesting plants and trees, playgrounds, boating lake and some lovely walkways past well laid out flowerbeds. There's also a surprisingly wide variety of birdlife and lots of squirrels, not to mention lots of turtles in the lake. Oh, and it's got monitor lizards. Loads of them. We counted 35 before we got bored with counting. They range in size from small youngsters a couple of feet long to fully grown ones over seven feet long from nose to tail. They're perfectly safe, (although I wouldn't advise parents to let their kids get too close) and fascinating creatures, which, lets face it, you don't often end up sharing a park with!"

It has walking tracks, playgounds, a lake with paddle boats, huge water monitors (dragons) and a lot of greenery.It also has the best value for money sporting club/gym etc. I have ever seen.You just need a copy of your passport, a passport photo along with the up front annual payment of 40 baht ..... Yes 40 baht......You need a medical certificate if you want to use the pool facility ..The club has a large well equipped gym, 25 meter swimming pool, basket ball court with nets on the rings , two tennis courts, a table tennis room with three good quality tables and a music room with guitars and keyboards .. If you are staying in Bangok for even a week or two and need your sporting fix , just do it.Getting there is easy.. Either take the BTS Silom line to Sala Daeng and take the 600ish meter walk to the park or take the MRT and exit at the Silom station in which.case the escalator will deliver you to the front gate of the park ..Walk in , stay to your right and the club is a 150 meters on the right ... You also receive an I.D. card for access ...Good luck..."

I stay on Sukhumvit so it is only three stops away on the MRT and costs 21 bahts. The park is clinically managed, not what I personally prefer. I like more wild places, more areas of trees and undergrowth for wildlife, which are lacking in this park. There are plenty of big trees, paths, canals, a lake, short grass and cycle ways. The toilet facilities are clean and well managed and there are stalls to buy cold drinks and snacks from. It was very hot when I walked through the park, around 37c, but there was enough shade to make it pleasant.If you like a big open manicured space that lacks a little character, then you will enjoy a stroll through Lumphini Park. Just make sure you don't miss the entrances which are towards the corners of the park. I ended up walking all the way down the outside before I found an entrance and it was a long way down a busy road!"

But overall because Bangkok has huge traffic and therefor noisy (although honking is not heard off), thought of just spending some time at a quiet place, with my partner in tow. Hence, headed this way. From Siam, we hired a Tuk Tuk, that cost us some 70 THB. Must be around 10 minutes' distance without traffic. Lumpini is a huge park, very well maintained. Roads within the park are well constructed, vehicles are not allowed beyond the designated parking slots. The fountains are nice, boating is also in there. Nice overall place for some quick photo sessions as well. The waters in there has some very big lizards, they are very scary. The scarier part is that the canals / water-ways that passes through, within this park has no fencing, meaning that the lizards can come out of the water and rest adjacent to you on the lawns. All the best then !Washroom facility is available. But then, looking at a bigger picture, a park is a park. How much will the boys really enjoy ??? Girls like it more ! But nice for a quiet stroll.

The best thing to do is to follow the jogging/walking/biking path that goes around the park (2.54 KM around). This allows you to watch the locals exercising and doing Tai Chi as well as see the monitor lizards, the lake and to stop off at the King Rama VI statue. Or if you are not in the mood to walk, bring a picnic breakfast or lunch and just sit by the lake in the shade and enjoy this oasis in the city...."

Scenic and fairly large, this park seems to be a popular spot for locals and tourist alike. That being said I never felt crowded and there were plenty of places to sit down and relax in piece and quiet. The park seems to host festivals from time to time, I had just missed one as I saw people cleaning up( bummer). I was told there were large lizards but didnt see any ( bummer again). There are places to rent boats to paddle along the lake. Places to buy food and drink by the entrances. Plenty of shaded places to sit whether under a tree or a beautifully designed pavilion. Its right by the bts so getting there isnt hard.If I were a local loving nearby I would be at this park everyday."

The park is connected to the underground station, Known as the MRT, so there is no issues for transport. Very close to the Dusit Thani Hotel and Silom Road. Across from the park is the very famous Chulalongkorn Hospital, The Re Cross headquarters and many other sites you can visit, walking distance. Bangkok is a great walking city.There is also a public swimming pool area, if you needed it.I visit the park often to take in my walking exercise. So I am not new to the PARK, but I have never reviewed it, its time now. People don't realize we have such a beautiful place to visit. Just a word of advise, if you go to the park at just about 6pm, please stand up for the national anthem like everybody else does, not walk or sit until it is over, just 2 minutes or so.

A calming park that is as tranquil as one can get in electrifying Bangkok.Tai-chi workouts, yoga enthusiasts, joggers, dancers, birdwatchers, cycling nuts - they are all here.... as are paddle boats in the lakes.Aptly named The Home of Hope, opened from 10am to pm daily is a haven for homeless children.I am told that education, counselling to help homeless children are provided.Less necessary, perhaps, but more iconic ... is the landmark statue of King Rama VI.A favourite place for tourists and locals alike to breath in nature."

Every Sunday at 5.30pm there is a concert with some little venders selling popcorn and drinks. We saw the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra which was a real treat.

This is because the national anthem is played and can be heard through the loudspeakers in every corner of the park.Do you fancy a nice paddleboat tour on the small lake, then come back in the afternoon.Tip - walk the park in both directions and you will notice the differences, enjoy !!"

It\u2019s a fairly large park so there were different folks doing their thing. Some folks had color-coded shirts for group identification & each group had its table & chair set up so after their exercise they can enjoy coffee, noodles & the view. There's a duck head boat rental to cruise around the man-made lake. The park also teemed with different types of birds like doves, pigeons, egret & black crows. There were squirrels, too. Here you can also find the memorial for the people who have contracted HIV. A sound system was being set up during the day as they usually have a concert in the park in the evenings. The whole area was donated by King Rama. You can find his monument at the main entrance of the park. That\u2019s at the corner of Rama & Ratchaburri road & across Dusit Thani. Don\u2019t worry; you don\u2019t need an overpass to cross the street if you\u2019re on the other side. There\u2019s a pedestrian lane. Since we stayed at Silom Street it was our first destination for the morning then the Erawan Shrine (see separate review). At 8am they have a flag ceremony which is prompted by the park patrollers by blowing their whistles at the start & at the end. To get away from traffic, Lumpini can be reached either by MRT (subway) then you get off at Lumpini station or BTS (skytrain) then get off again at Sala Daeng Station."

After walking the streets of noisy Bangkok it was bliss to enter the park (no entrance fee) and find shade under the trees. The lake in Lumpini is surrounded by a walkway, and you will find benches under the trees and green areas to sit on in the shade everywhere. To see Lumpini Park with the highrises of Bangkok city in the background was very special. This was a new experience for us, having been i Bangkok quite a few times. We even got to meet a fat, gorgeous 2 meter long water monitor hunting along one of the smaller streams in the park. Rather scary sight if you ask me, but great. I you need a day off the noise and people and just relax under a tree with a book and soak up nature in the middle of Bangkok City, this is the place to visit! It's a very short walk from the Silom Line SkyTrain."

Starting from its opening at 5:00 a.m. til its closing time, the place was frequented by all walk of life.Hence I would recommend tourist or visitor to visit the place and understanding the local residence in their activities within the park. I had visited the Stanley Park in Vancouver and the Central Park in New York. So much I learned and absorbed from meeting the local and non-local. Isn't this part of the beauty in tourism in connecting us in different countries with similar activities. I would recommend to visit the park between 6-8 a.m. and 5-7 p.m. Have a good walk and say hi to some local. You will be amazed the friendly response in return."

On the various stretches of grass there are groups going through their yoga, Tai Chi and vedic chanting and it seems that you are welcome to join in most groups. There is of course the inevitable Thai Massage and variety of food vendors in and around the park. getting there early in the morning and doing a few laps of inner road and then enjoying some Thai Tea is highly recommended for those that enjoy this kind of thing. You will experience an aspect of Thai culture that is easy to miss if you are on the treadmill of the standard \"Bangkok\" tours.

They, and everybody in and around the park were polite and welcoming. It still is a pretty place, quiet in the morning and early afternoon. I have not made it back at night, but I would like to. Unless you speak Thai well I would avoid the evening time with small children but teens and older deserve the right to see how a political movement is really just many individuals speaking up. If you are a fearful person stay away but if you are really interested in Thailand, go, listen, learn and become more aware of what's going on."

Anti-government protesters have literally pitched thousands of one-man tents all over the park together with washing lines, portable toilets and stalls selling mostly clothing. There are also loud speakers blurting out speeches and music non-stop (I wouldn\u2019t recommend staying in any nearby hotels). Outside the main gates are larger tents giving away free food and drinks. However, having said all that I must say there was no sense of menace, and we felt completely safe. The protesters were all smiles and very friendly. All they seemed to have done is block off nearby streets and then set up stalls to sell a variety of items mostly reflecting their cause. Would recommend a visit to the park once the protesters have dispersed."

And despite being slap bang in the middle of Bangkok, Lumpini Park is an amazingly tranquil relaxing area. There are many benches to sit on, there's even a small amphitheatre where you can watch students rehearsing their performances. And if you're observant you'll find some shy but rather intimidating water monitor lizards! Don't worry, they keep clear of people, and it's a carefully planned task to approach them for close-up photos.Generally, I'd recommend spending a few hours, maybe a morning or an afternoon, here."

Lumpini Park is a nice reprieve from the spawling urban jungle of Bangkok, but due to the climate, it isn't lush, it isn't that inviting, and it could use some more fauna and perhaps some activities. They do have monitor lizards to entertain you, a peaceful pond to contemplate around, and a pathway to jog on which is nice along with some good views of the Bangkok skyline. Again, big green space in Bangkok is incredibly welcome, but coming from the west, you may be in for a bit of a letdown from this park."

We got off the BTS and had a bit of a hair raising time crossing the non- traffic lighted intersection crossing but the trick is to walk calmly across when there is a break in traffic., probably easier to walk up the road a wee bit and cross when there is only one way traffic to deal with. Took us a while to see our first lizard but as we walked around the paddle boating lake we saw much larger ones in pairs just hanging around sun bathing around the lake edge. Lots of quiet spaces but the park could be prettied up with more flowering plants and beds I reckon. A childrens playground is also there but I believe the place is most popular with locals early moring for exercise and in weekends. Definitely worth going to see these monitor lizards; also spotted a turtle, white cranes, large black noisy crows, pretty butterfly. We did this visit as a way to fill in about an hour of time on the way to do another activity, visited about 11.30 am, not too hot, lots of shady trees."

One thing that no one seems to believe: there are giant lizards in the park. I mean like huge, komodo dragon lizards or something. I was walking along the side of the pond and saw something big swishing through the water. As it got closer to shore, I saw that it was a rather large (like four foot) lizard.

We stopped and starred - a lizard was moving out in slow motion and jumped into the water. He ( I'm sure it was a male) was so big as my husband had told me and so fat that his belly looked like a balloon. After a little swimming tour he returned to his tube.

This time - lots of little ones were out and about. We didn't see nearly as many very large ones (7+ feet long). I think we saw only 3 or 4 really large monitors. Most were 2-4 feet. And, most are willing to let you get a shot or two before they start to cruise away. One came pretty close to me (which is rare that they walk to you). Ultimately, rain or shine, this park is a must. Just bring an umbrella for the rain and you can stay for hours...This is a great park. Wonderful just to wander about but phenomenal if you want to see lots of wild animals in an interesting/natural setting. We saw lots of monitors, turtles, and birds: heron, egrets, mocking birds, and a kingfisher. It was spectacular. Every time we come to Bangkok we try to visit this park.

Conviently located off of the MRT(underground train) line and a 10 minute walk from the BTS(elevated train) line, easy to visit. Right now, the park is about 25% occupied by demonstators against the current PM but they keep to themselves and are not threatening in any way or manner. I think it just adds to the charm of the park. There are bike rentals, boat rentals, people practicing tai-chi, fitness enthusiasts and benches galore so it's very easy to spend several hours walking around or just taking life easy."

We were impressed by the free exercise centres in the park although 2 mins on a press up machine in that heat defeated me. We saw the central venue which had a few demonstrators waiting for the evening anti-Thaksin event and the fast food stalls being set up to cater for it. Everyone we met was friendly but very much against the government amnesty proposal. Good luck to them!"

In the mornings (7am) there were groups doing Tai Chi and Yoga, and in the evening mass aerobics (100+ people) frenetically bouncing around to hi-nrg music. Apparently free - people just turn up, find a space, and join in. Be aware that if you're in the park at 6pm you'll hear a whistle blow and the national anthem play over speakers. You should also spot that everyone stops what they're doing to show respect to the King. Another whistle and everything starts up again and people take up what they were doing.If you fancy floating around in a plastic swan this is the place for you. Beautifully kitch. Plenty of places to sit and watch the world go by. At the time of our visit a settlement for anti government protest was very active but no threat or danger and the park was in use as normal."

You enter the park without the grand entrance at the front but you are immediately in the park. - - From the front gates you are confronted by the protest tent city on your arrival and this could be off putting (although I am advised that the tent city will be returning to Govt.

Plus people walking, running... No bikes until 10 am keeps the paths safe. See the monitor lizards in the waters. An urban oasis surrounded by skyscrapers, more being added every day."

I think it's not anything special but if you are near it it's deffinetely worth of visiting. It's better choose cloudy day because if the weather is hot you can't enjoy walking around! Of course you can just relax and lay on the lawn but remember to get food and water with you or you won't get far. There is a highway around the Lumpini park so it'll take a while to actually get enjoy the park area. It looks like golf course where have placed benches and tables. There is also lakes where you can find small lizards."

In Lumpini Park I spotted monitor lizards and enjoyed nice lake. This place is probably supposed to be relaxing, but it actually wasn't during my visit due to a kind of event for Thais with really terrible loud music. Furthermore, I was accosted by a stranger calling himself a boxer. I liked the Benjasiri Park more."

Saw bunch of youngster and senior citizen train their washboards..ckckck and some of them only sitting & gossiping around...If u happen to be around and into nature, please do check this spot out."

A circuit of the park walking takes under an hour and there were many, many locals there every day as well as some foreigners. The park was apparently a gift to the people of Bangkok from the king and it is certainly appreciated by the many daily users, including a number of groups having daily picnic breakfasts. We loved the fact that at 8am the national anthem is played and everybody stops what they are doing for its duration.There is playground equipment in the park and paddle boats on its lake. A great place to visit for some exercise and to see where the fit Thais exercise. It's also full of beautiful tropical plantings."

It proved to be a great find because my son enjoyed the playground, where the equipment was plastic on sandpits and looked relatively new without any rusty parts. The playgrounds are suitable for both young children and older kids. We also enjoyed taking him for a paddle on the lake on the swan boat, which was only 40bht for half an hour. The swan boat is relatively safe even for a young child (but only if there are two accompanying adults) because the seat for the child is situated between two adult seats and life jackets can be provided. My son had fun because we managed to spot turtles and fish in the lake. The lady at the booth selling tickets for the swan boat was also very friendly, even giving him a small banana as a snack after we were done with the paddle! The park, however, is huge and if you are travelling with young children, you are likely to only be able to explore a limited area before they get tired. It is also a nice place to have a picnic. The playground and the lake are walking distance from the gate where there is a carpark."

Situated in the silom area of bangkok it is very easy to find and get to lumphini park. By BTS skytrain hop on and take the silom line stopping at sala deang station. You can see the park from the station. Just exit walk down cross the road and your there. lumphini is beautifully planted out and cared for by the gardeners. It has many pretty flower beds and minature hedges. The park is large with varied types of palm and other tropical trees and plants. You will see a few bridges aswell which are ideal to watch the fish from and the huge monitor lizards which live in the park. If you love reptiles then this is the place for you. The park has many monitor lizards both young and old plus a few types of turtles. You can spot the lizards under bridges cooling off or swimming along side the lake sides. These lizards can grow to 4 and 5ft long and are large. They can startle you if you are unaware of their presence. Watch out for the fish also including catfish, carp, bream, and very big wels. You can buy fish pellets from woman in the park or bring your own bread. Keep a close eye out for the white crane birds as they are very secretive. You will not have too look very hard to see the 100s of crows as you will hear them first. Not the most pretty birds, they are the same as UK crows black and noisey. Lumphini had a very good running/jogging road which is used also by cyclists. A great way to get excercise and feel good. You can also go to the out door gym or play chess under a shady tree.  Take a paddle on the lake in one of the big pedlo swans, you can find many lizards if you paddle accross to the bridge opposite the hire station for the pedlos. After running cycling or the gym you can take a shower at the opposite end of the park in the toilet shower rooms. You can also buy snacks like tea coffee crisps and cool drinks from the small shops at each end of the park. Visit early in the morning to see the thai chinese doing tai chi exercise (6.30am) 100s of people do this before their work. In the evening when the sun begins to go down you can join and aerobics class at the sala daeng BTS side. If you want to escape the busy bangkok streets then lumphini park is the answer.  Hire a mat and sleep relax by the water. I rate lumphini 8 out of 10. Please contact me if you have any questions. spigs"

There are people doing Thai Chi, running and cycling, and also there is a swimming pool, tennis, and basket ball courts for the taking.

If you are a tourist (like me) then I am not sure that it is special enough to make the detour as there are far better parks to experience around the world. Still if you do have an hour to spare then it is a clean and well maintained area and the giant lizards that laze around the lakes and canals are an interesting sight.The park is situated about 10 minutes walk from the BTS station at Sala Daeng most of which you can do on the walkway apart from crossing the main road just before the entrance. I visited the park mid morning on a Monday when it was very quiet. It is meant to be a popular spot for locals to exercise but probably early morning and after dusk. I was hoping to get something to eat at the Food Court but this was deserted with nothing being served and judging by the signs it is only open early morning. There was a small kiosk near Gate 4, however, that served drinks and snacks."

As soon as I entered the large gates I was greeted with the sight of hundreds of runners in fighting fit shape going around the track. The green of the lush foliage was further saturated by the overcast skies. Soon after what sounded like the warning bells of an ice cream truck everyone came to a standstill. I had not heard it before but I assumed the national anthem had started right after that and every walker, runner and visitor froze for a few moments as the loudspeaker played the song. It was quite a unique sight. As soon as it was over everyone went promptly back to what they had been doing. On the other side large groups of aerobic dancers practiced their moves to boom box music and under the direction of fitness trainers. The Park reminds me partly of Central Park in Manhattan and somewhat of similar expanses in the cities of Taiwan. A large lake is equipped with paddle boats and a library offers a reading experience as well. The local metro train and city traffic go right by the park which is located quite centrally in Bangkok and a welcome break from the tuk tuk taxi hustle bustle of the city."

I left feeling invigourated and energised. There's a gym, pool, waterways full of turtles, fish and other increadible National wildlife. You can even get a relaxing massage if you want. The Thai Kingdom has provided plenty of discreet security so I felt really safe there. Lot's of joggers, excercise and general chilling out happening. NOT a place to hang out and loiter, or party for that matter, it's more serene and tranquil. A1. The Air is cooler and cleaner, probably because of the delightful lack of concrete, and the sculptures are inspirational. Great place for the family, the kids, the elderly and everyone inbetween.Faultless."

My first time there and realize that this park is bustling with activities in the early morning.Stalls outside the park selling all sorts of stuff from vegetables to beverages and clothes.Inside you will see groups of people running, yoga sessions and groups of people doing Tai Chi.Nice lake in the middle where you can either rent a paddle boat or just sit by it and enjoy the view. Many monuments around the park with sculptures worth just stopping to take a look and read the artistic descriptions.I ran the two rounds around the park on the organized running route, total of about 2.5KM per round.Park security is safe and here you will see the most helpful policeman in the world helping the elderly into taxi and opening the doors to help them out of the cab.Now for the great surprise, there is a amazing food court (hawker centre in Singaporean terms) in the park near the Rama 4 entrance. So local that I enjoyed every bit of it.Have a selection of congee with a great selection of local chinese accompaniment dishes. Or have a plate of Roast pork rice or grab few spring rolls for a quick snack. Definitely not touristy. Highly recommended for a cheap and good breakfast. But do not go too late as food runs out by 9am-10am.Overall, a great morning for me with a run and a a great breakfast."

Senior people were performing fine movements and doing it slowly; while younger generation was jumping all the time to different beats. One of the favourite that was played many times was \"gangnam style\". Few were silently jogging. This time of year, it was very humid and i was drained after i round across the lake. I saw catfish/ mudskippers [fish with whiskers] near shallow area of pond. While, I was sitting on a bench, a beautiful monitor lizard came up close [I almost thought it was Komodo dragon; but then gathered myself as Komodo's are in indonesia (thanks animal planet)]. I got some nice pictures, but as i moved closer, the lizard shyed away into dark green water of lake from where it was difficult to capture in photograph.

It's been years since my work has taken me to this part of town so I took advantage of the close proximity and went down to the park every morning to walk before starting work.If you're staying anywhere near Lumpini Park during your trip to Bangkok it's worth the trip to visit, but I recommend going early before the sun comes up and the sweltering heat of the day takes over. At 6am you can join the open aerobics group on the SW side of the park right near the Si Lom MRT station. I suppose you could join one of the many groups of older folks doing tai chi, but you'd have to know the moves in advance. Of course you can add to the large numbers of those walking or jogging around the well marked 2.5 kg loop that circles the perimeter of the park. If you're into weight lifting two free weight gyms are set up under the trees alongside the jogging path. I imagine there's a small fee to use the equipment although there was no sign. If you do decide to come down later in the day you can rent a swan shaped paddle boat or a canoe, both of which are 40 baht for half an hour. You can also pick up picnic food/snacks from the dozens of street vendors outside the park and have a picnic in one of the gazebos/shelters. The children's playground area was large with multiple slides, swings and pieces of climbing equipment.For a big city I really enjoyed the wildlife sightings in Lumpini- grey squirrels with bushy white tails, long legged white shore birds feeding next to the water aerators in the ponds and dozens of other bird species. Especially liked the awesome Hia's freely roaming about -i.e. the giant gila monsters which are about 2 meters long nose to tail. The park is so large I lost sight of the city in some places. What a cool place to enjoy authentic Bangkok life early in the morning."

Nearly 500 people doing jazzercise in the middle of the park with really enthusiastic leaders. We stopped and bought a big bag of fish food at the entrance, took a pedal boat out for only 40 Bhat (+40 bhat deposit) for half an hour and had a lovely time feeding fish and turtles from the boat. Definitely recommend doing this as it is really tranquil. We saw loads of huge monitor lizards roaming around the park, as well as large variety of beautiful birds, some cranes even! The flora was fantastic, loads to stop and see. We got taught how to offer a prayer at a buddhist shrine by a lovely older lady who didnt speak a word of english! That was an expereince, then as we were walking back towards the entrance, everyone stopped , joggers, jazzercisers, everyone, while the national anthem played, then they all just carried on!

Lumphini Park is a large park in the middle of Bangkok, and walking distance from Silom, Sathorn and Suhkumvit. There is no other comparable or practical place to run, walk in Bangkok. Lumphini Park has a large lake in the middle, and small canals that weave through the park. There is 2.5km paved and maintained, tree lined path that circles the inside of the park and is popular in the mornings with runners and walkers starting about 5:30am. In the mornings the park is busy with local Thais doing yoga, tai chi, exercising, rollerblading, aerobics etc etc.During the day, there is rental boating (great for kids), food, tennis courts, pool (new), exercise facility (new), picnic tables, lots of shade, etc."

Great statue at entrance with a place to see Thai ppl pray & ask for blessings. Nice lake with swan shape paddle boat for hire & lots of setting to sit & relax & take in peaceful surrounds. Saw large water monitor lizards walking around & locals offer straw mats to buy to lie down on grass for a snooze lol. You can hire bikes to ride around & see tourists getting in their fitness run. Street vendors at entrance for cool drink or snack & close to BTS. We took BTS from Chong Nonsi & got off at Sala Deng then walked about 5 mins. Have to cross large road which was a little scary but wait for red light (don't trust traffic though lol & cross at the pedestrian crossing :)"

It was quiet when I was there and I'm guessing it always this peaceful from day to day (when there are no festivals or events planned). You'll no doubt see some monitor lizards roaming around. They are pretty impressive in terms of size. I'm glad somebody pre-warned me that they were in there, otherwise I'd have had a shock, especially as they can look statue-like at times! But anyway they tend to avoid any kind of interaction with humans, you can't get close enough for them to feel threatened or for them to harm you, they keep their distance from people and therefore I don't think they're a danger.I was living in Surasak which is only two stops away on the Skytrain, so definitely worth going if you're close by. I enjoyed 'dodging' the sprinklers on one very hot summers day in the park ;)"

Other of the world's urban parks (and even other of Bangkok's parks) have more to offer by way of fountains, or food, or attractions, but Lumphini is my favorite urban park worldwide for de-stressing between meetings. It is so well maintained that you feel clean and comfortable there..far better maintained than any other of the dozens of nternationally famous urban parks I've seen. But it is also wild enough to have animal life suited to anyone's taste. Egrets and fifteen or twenty other bird species will be found there regularly, Tokays, turtles and Monitors head the non-bird list of interesting life. The lawns are lovely, the ponds nice, the atmosphere always relaxing. Early mornings bring many exercise classes to watch, dusk brings many strolling couples to watch, and mid day gives you your choice of sunburn or shade, brisk walk or barefoot romp, nap or meeting note preparation. It is a uniquely relaxing place in the world's most invigorating city. Take advantage of it"

From there started walking towards MRT Silom as Sala Daeng is interchanging station between Skytrain and MRT. Just follow the directions and you will reach Dusit Thani Hotel,walk down the exit stairs,cross the main road and here you are at Lumpini Park. By the time we reached it was already dark ...so i just sat on a bench near the lake...aerobic class was going on in far distance.People were jogging ,walking,cycling behind me.My hubby wandered away for few pics.It was very relaxing just sitting there and enjoying the quietness.i would love to go again, just to relax."

But best of all is the uncrowded green space, and the flora and fauna - keep your eyes open for the wildlife, especially the huge monitor lizards lazing near the water. The park is particularly atmospheric first thing in the morning, when people of all ages come to practice tai chi, aerobics and other keep-fit activities. For info, there is no big wheel in or near Lumpini Park, and the Suan Lum night market which was next to the park is long closed. So the main photo currently accompanying this attraction is misleading. The park is easily reached from Lumpini station (MRT) or Sala Daeng (Skytrain)."

You can have mediate, just seat a people watch or just walk around and see all the different buildings."

Whilst walking towards the lake noticed something fairly large swimming towards the shore & on closer inspection was a 4/5 foot Monitor Lizard, that didn't seem too fussed with me getting close enough to take a few pictures!Sat on a big rock under a tree to catch some shade as was a blazing day & wondered how something so quiet & serene could be in the middle of the sprawling metropolis that is Bangkok!"

Most taxi and tuk tuk drivers were not even interested in going that far across town.Sure, it is a fairly large park with a lake and some trees and a food stall area, but nothing out of the ordinary and quite plain. I expected a huge city like BKK to have a much nicer public park.Sure, if you are only in Bangkok and want to relax a bit, then it would be fine, but if your holiday includes going to smaller towns around Thailand then you will see FAR nicer scenery and park like surroundings elsewhere. Give this place a miss.The main thing of interest we saw at this park was the bodybuilding gym / workout area. Unusual to see Thai bodybuilders."

Our walk took us by swan boats, people lounging, its a very popular place with the locals, we saw a few dragons, not sure what kind, they are about 5-6feet long & were both swimming in the canal & on the dry land. A little disconcerting. For 10 baht we bought a bag of puffed corn & fed it to the fish gathered for this purpose. The fish were huge & we even saw a turtle. There is a Chines section, and an outdoor area where men were lifting weights. Very interesting park."

They can roam freely around the park and will sometimes move out of the water... which will make you feel as though you are watching some kind of science fiction movie! I thought these were Komodo dragons but realised that they were smaller. Actually the species is called \"water monitor\" and they are cousins of the Komodo dragon. This creature is a protected species in Thailand and is native to the region.Tip: If you are going there by public transit, don't let yourself be misled by the name. Don't get at Lumpini station but at Si Lom MRT which is one stop awat."

A vendor just outside the southwest (main) gate sells good iced milk tea - excellent drink to cool off the against the heat. Park maintenance needs to be more active to keep the grounds clean. We saw a lot of trash being blown by the wind into the ponds, maybe because park trash bins a few and far in-between. Still the park is an excellent place to unwind and get away from the busy city life."

This is Bangkok's version of central park. It's best to avoid the heat of the day so there are 2 options. Come early morning and you will see the park crowded with older people, engaged in Tai Chi and other interesting Oriental martial arts and exercises. Also there is a great food court on weekends near the Tennis Courts - delicious authenticTeochew food and a heavenly fresh juice stall. Come later in the day and the crowd will be distinctly younger with a number of free aerobics areas and the path filled with joggers, walkers and kids. The park can be accessed by public transport using the MRT - Lumpini and Silom stations and BTS - Saladaeng."

Lumpini Park is a large parkland area handily adjacent to both BTS Skytrain and MRT (Subway) stations, at one end of busy Silom Road in Bangkok, also a kilometer or so from Rajprasong shopping area, Siam Paragon, Central World, Central Chidlom, etc. A large bitumen circuit (2.543km) tracks the park's internal perimeter, and is hugely popular with runners, walkers, and bicyclists (fixed times for bicycles). Or one can just laze on the grass in the shade of a huge tree (byo mat or plastic sheet) watch the passersby or catch a few zzzzz. This park is one of the few relatively tranquil refuges from frenetic Bangkok. At first glance, one might be taken aback by the presence of \"crocodiles\", but these are actually Asian water monitors (lizards). Some are absolutely huge, and over 2 meters long. Keep a safe distance from them, as they can go on the defensive/offensive if they feel threatened. Carparking free on Sundays. Normally best early morning and late afternoon until dark. After dark it tends to empty out and gets a bit spooky. Lots of aerobics groups in the afternoon weekend days, so take your pick! The playgrounds for the kids (there are 2), with slides, slippery dips, swings, etc are very popular, as are places to play basketball, badminton, etc. There are various places for adults to work out dotted around the park. Some nice rose gardens near the Senior Cits Building, and in season, beautiful tropical orchids abound. A pleasant escape, and quiet uncrowded places can be found as well as places for healthy hyperactivity. :) Btw, no smoking, thank you!"

Running on pavements is not ideal in the city due to the uneven terrain, motorbike taxis and many small alleys. The park is easy to locate, about 5-10 mins walk from Sala Daeng BTS station. I reached there at 5.30pm to escape the heat. However, it started to get dark by 6.15pm. That's when the aerobics sessions ended as well. My advice is, get there earlier so that you can join in the aerobics workout. It's fun!Overall, it's a great place to hang out and mingle among the locals."

Early morning is a great time to visit, as you'll see regulars carrying out their tai chi moves, while you should (of course) remain perfectly still throughout the playing of the national anthem at 8 am. It's also a great place to run or walk, while the park hosts several interesting attractions, including a swimming pool and a futsal court, among others.There is often a musical performance on Sundays in the park, which can provide a nice setting for a picnic. On the downside, be rather cautious if visiting later in the evening, as you may encounter a few less than friendly folk. However, please note that this is no more of a problem than in any other modern city. There is a nice statue of HM Rama V on horseback at one end of the park, which faces the entrance to SIlom Road (at intersection with Rama IV Road). To reach this point, you can take a BTS train to Sala Daeng station or MRT subway train to Si Lom."

It's a fairly large park with a couple of lakes and several walking and running tracks. The park itself is nice and surprisingly peaceful (until the evenings), but what I enjoy is all the wildlife. There are numerous Water Monitors (giant lizards) that walk, swim and laze about the park. Near the bridges are fish waiting to be fed, with locals willing to sell you bread and other treats. Wait near the edge of the lake for a while and turtles appear. I've even seen people hand feed what look like eels in nearby creeks.In the evenings the locals appear in large numbers to perform aerobics to loud music.I usually come here late in the afternoon by the subway to Lumpini, then once finished I walk to Patpong (about 10 mins away) for dinner and the night markets, then it's the skytrain back to Sukhumvit. A great relaxing way to spend an afternoon in the big city."

There is a large lake centrally located and plenty of resting areas to enjoy the serenity of the park. Watch out for the dragons, some are quite large.

After reading several comments, and watching Youtube videos, I knew I had to see it for myself. The park is indeed an oasis of tranquility in the middle of the Bangkok hubub. I was there in the early hours of the morning, and already the park was full of people doing their exercises. We had people jogging, doing taichi, yoga etc. There was even a makeshift gym where folks can do a workout. I was more interested to look for the park's resident reptiles, the monitor lizards. It took a while before I could locate one such critter. These animals must have been so used to humans by now, and the one I spotted didn't scurry away immediately, but just sat there, allowing itself to be photographed. At exactly 8am, the national anthem would be played, and all had to stand at attention. Overall, a nice place to visit."

But I tend to prefer several other parks in the city.If you can stay at a hotel that's convenient to a park and use that park early or later in your day, your stay will most likely be much more enjoyable than if you ignore Bangkok's parks when locating your sleeping spot. With the Dusit Thani and several other hotels nearby, Lumpini Park would be an excellent amenity to be near your hotel!But there are several other parks - which you might consider booking a hotel nearby.

Just a few poeple working out in the open air gym, several families having picnics around the lake, several couples strolling around the park, and a few young people having a paddle in the swan boats. The food stalls open from 4.30am - 10am only so there was no food available to buy except for a few stall holders near the exit gates. The park closes at 3pm."

The big monitor lizards that roam around are pretty fun. There's a section somewhere with these huge HUGE palm trees that I find fascinating. They're always hard for me to find though, because the park is so darn huge. You'll usually see an assortment of people out running or using the permanent exercise equipment that's been drilled into the ground. There's no street-cart food available inside the park, and very little outside of it, so bring your own food if you want to eat."

Oh don't smoke in the park or you will face a heavy fine and its advisable not to be in the park after dark as there have been reports of petty crime. Remember though Bangkok is a very safe city providing you keep your brains with you. Nearest sky train station is Sala Daeng 5 minute walk to the park."

You will enjoy many good food along with many discount shopping..... BUT .... You must know how to negotiated to the lowest price possible. Negotiation is an art , I can't teach you that. It is depend on how bad you like your pick and.... try to hide the feeling from the vendors. :-) .. If they sense that you want it bad .... prepare to pay higher price.But you are the tourist they know that and this is the disadvantage. Be Patient ...... and .... Be Patient. Unless you are run out of time and want it BAD. So, shop early and check it around.... and .... Good Luck."

Not because it's particularly beautiful or peaceful, but because there's always something worth seeing.Early in the morning (6am) there are crowds of elderly Thai-Chinese practising Thai Chi.all through the day there are groups of Thais eating and drinking (it's the national hobby).There's a multi-purpose outdoor gym which seems to be made from scrap iron, where the odd local bench presses a couple of tyres on the ends of an old iron bar.But probably the most famous inhabitants of the park are the monitor lizards. They look like Komodo dragons and can grow to 2.5 metres in length. They lie by the lakeside, basking in the sun and allow curious photographers to get quite close before sliding into the water.Be warned though - they have a nasty bite and can slash with their powerful tails. There are several hundred of these beasts roaming the park, from little 6 inch babies to the monsters. Somehow they all seem to find enough to eat, even though Thais never feed them.There are a few cats and rats hanging around, I suspect the others became lunch."

A green oasis of calm, well kept lawns, mirror still lakes and some fascinating wildlife - all completely free.One of the first things to excite me were the giant 5ft long monitor lizards that roam freely around the park. I think the locals found us just as interesting and amusing as we followed and watched the lizards. Graceful white egrets stand serenely at the edges of the lakes and trees are hung with orchids. Beautiful bonzais sit atop posts in the waterways as little arched bridges pass above. Also you'll feel safe as the park is a constant stream of gentle city folk jogging the easy walkways - stopping at 3pm for the national anthem followed by communal exercise. Sit awhile at dusk and watch the bats feeding overhead or small geckos scurry for cover.The park combines tranquility, wild yet kept grounds and wildlife highlights with a safe haven for families, wildlife enthusiasts, photographers or quite simply anyone who just wants a breather in a city that's manic and bustling. Most definitely worth a visit!"

There are rowing/peddle boats for hire on the lake which is a great way to cool down and relax. There are policeman regularly cycling around the park to make sure all is in order, which is reassuring. We took a picnic to the park where we read our books, doozed in the sun before exploring the rest of the park for a few hours. We combined this with a visit to the Red Cross Snake Farm which was only 15mts away."
